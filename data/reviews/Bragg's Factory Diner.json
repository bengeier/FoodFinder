{"text":"I'm sitting here with my mom and lil sister. Moms a carnivore, teen sis is a vegetarian and I'm making a slow transition to vegan. We ALL agree this place is the BOMB and OMG I'm coming back. I wanna find a warehouse apartment down the street so I'm not to far away. I've been missing a really good vegan diner since I left Chicago a year ago and now I've found a new home."}
{"text":"YUM!  My husband took me here on one of our very few nights out.   First Fridays in Phoenix, made the restaurant very busy, the waitress was friendly, and the food delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place! As a vegan it's nice to have another great spot downtown to go to but I went with 2 non-vegans who also thought the food was fantastic. The location is really cool and the service was super-friendly. I had the biscuits and gravy with hash browns and I can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Speaking as a non-vegan, non-vegetarian, non-gluten free, eat it if it tastes good type of diner, I can still say this is one of my favorite breakfast places.  The menu has a wide range of food with silly names (Koo-Koo Bananas Pancakes, Fruity Ol' Goat, and my current favorite, the Gluten Free Your Mind Waffle).  Each and every item comes from a carefully crafted recipe, and leaves behind any hint of healthy diet restrictions.  The pie, cookies, and even coffee and iced tea are all great.  The only reason a star is left off is that while friendly, the service is sometimes painfully slow.  We had to stop coming before work as it sometimes just took way too long.  Today it was far better, so this could be a staffing issue that's since been resolved.  Bottom line, everyone in Phoenix should check out Bragg's for breakfast.  If you've got visitors who are vegan, etc., this is definitely a place to bring them."}
{"text":"Great little Veggie spot! Atmosphere is quaint and fun. Great selection of vegetarian and vegan items along with a nice little kids menu. Fun! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"My second visit and really like the service and food. So far I have had the beet burger which sounds crazy but was pretty good. The potatoes with rosemary were barely room temp and definitely not worth ordering again. Today I had the chickpea & potato burger on a bun. Really good! My side of potato salad was quite different and also very good. I found the pies to have too thick a crust for my taste. Almost like a cookie crust. Both times the service was super!  A funky little place worth visiting."}
{"text":"My girlfriend pressured me into going vegan for the night. I ordered the Frank Lloyd Bite and was very pleased with the taste and amount of food. Desserts here are delicious as well. Going vegan again next weekend!"}
{"text":"Very yummy. Enjoyed every bite! Service was friendly and welcoming. We were passing through on a road trip and our waitress wouldn't let us leave without fresh water for the road. So nice. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I am from put of town and was thrilled to find a vegetarian place using the yelp! app. This place will not disappoint. The food was very tasty and there was plenty to enjoy. I had the almond pancakes and they were fantastic. All the food was delicious and the mismatched plates and different salt and pepper shakers on each table add to the charm. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I hate this place, the food is soooo fantastic. The service Rocks , and the owners are super friendly. This place has great breakfast, I recommend the Koo-Koo Bananas pancakes. They are so much full of flavor. The bananas are caramelized which adds so much to the breakfast. If you are in for something sweet, the pies and pastries are the Bomb."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Vegan and vegetarian and the food is absolutely fabulous! They were busy but we were served so attentively the time flew by and the food was SO SO SO worth it! This is our new favorite place for sure. Friendly, quality food including some items being organic. All around a very pleasurable experience...we are fans!!"}
{"text":"My wife is always on the lookout for places that cater to gluten free, dairy free and tasty menus. This place is awesome.  Delicious, unpretentious and cheap.  Jackpot!"}
{"text":"I am vegan and I hated this place. There were very minimal choices. The server acted very strange. She was acting like a cat who swallowed a mouse like she was hiding something very strange. there's no comparison to this place and Green. This place is awful. The only nice thing I can say is the cook who took our payment was very friendly. The food was very unsatifying. We went somewhere else to eat after this because no one ate their food and we were still hungry. Don't go."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian food from a stellar staff. The vibe in this establishment is great, the service is solid. This place is a diamond in the rough on Grand avenue. Much appreciation for the awesome food."}
{"text":"The sweets & beats salad was amazing! No other words to describe it! Would have liked a little more beets on the salad but regardless it was delightful."}
{"text":"Two words - Beet Burger. I could eat this 3/4 times a week.  Doesn't leave me feeling weighted down like a cow burger and it tastes great.  Couple more words - Nopales Like Home sandwich.  Another flavorful and fresh bite.  For the side I  enjoy the tangy and crunchy coleslaw. Yummy.  \"Would you like some Cappuccino mousse pie for dessert?\" \"Yes please, I'm worth it.\"  The ELT and Avamacado sandwich are superb as well. If you like mushrooms get the Reuben. I don't so I won't.  AND the desserts are fantastic."}
{"text":"It really bums me out to give Bragg's a poor review. The first few times we went,  we were instantly in love. The food was amazing, service friendly and the overall ambiance sweet. However,  the last two attempts eating here have been down right awful.   Last time, it took 15 min for a drink order and then 15 more for the actual drinks. They were out of several things, so the menu became limited. Fine. We chose other items and waited. And waited. For almost an hour for food that came microwaved and cold and downright gross. We left.  Thinking that was an off night, we waited several weeks to come back. Enter just now. We arrived for dinner and order three different things because they were again out of key ingredients. And drinks. There was basically nothing to choose.   Sadly, we left unhappy yet again. And unfortunately, probably will not try again."}
{"text":"I love this place! Vegan breakfast here is amazing. Everything I've had here has been awesome. The prices are so reasonable and the portions are big. The staff is always very friendly and accommodating. I've brought non-vegan/vegetarian friends and family who were equally impressed. The baked goods are also delicious- especially the muffins!"}
{"text":"Non existant server.   Basically, we arrived,  weren't greeted... finally were \"seated\" at a dirty table.  By dirty I mean, used utensils and coffee cups in front of our faces.   We went up to register to get our own menus.   Ten minutes later our server asked what we want to drink.  He had the personality of a brick, maybe a stoned brick.  We ordered,  first our coffees arrived. I had to get up and walk up to register to get a spoon and cream.   Then 15 mins later our items arrived.   Dropped at our table, and my friend who is vegan looked at her pancakes and saw butter.    I eat everything but she is strictly veggly. I had to then go up to the register, wait for someone to come back, and ask about the butter.  Turns out it's vegatarian margarine. Would have been good to know before her food got cold.    The cutlery was cheap, mugs all mismatched.   It felt like it needed a severe makeover.   I don't want to go on, but we literally had to guide the server on every simple thing we wanted..  to top it off I went up to the register and saw a tasty looking vegan pie.  I asked the server to add on a piece of berry pie, and he asked \" for here or to go?\" I said for here.  15 mins later no pie.   I was done at this point.    Done. So we went up and reminded him that I didn't get the pie.  \"Sorry I totally forgot, do you still want it?\" Again after 2 hours of being there I basically wanted out.   He said \"it's on the house\"    I paid the bill which should have added up to $45ish for three adults, coffee, and one pie.   The lady who rung us up severely undercharged us with a grand total of $21.    No apology I think it was just a severe lack of writing stuff down.   This was Saturday 1/24.    I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Don't let the other reviews and their website fool you.  Bragg's is an hour away from where I live and I will never ever return.  The food was mediocre at best.  Heavily oiled and lacking in creativity and flavor.  I ordered the Frank Lloyd Bite and was served an unappetizing plate of hash browns that were swimming in oil, eggplant bacon that was also drenched in oil and inedible, a doughy undercooked biscuit, and pancakes that automatically came topped with a mystery fake butter that when I asked our server about it he replied \"I dunno, not butter\" and then with some resistance he returned to inform me that it was an oil based butter like spread.  No water or coffee refill until we had finished our meal and had to ask for it.  Overall an unpleasant experience with bad food and poor service.  There are much better establishments for vegan fare in the Phoenix area.  *Update...Three hours later and I now have an extremely upset stomach due to the high amount of oily grease in the food.  Stay Away!!!"}
{"text":"THE COCONUT CURRY WAFFLE IS THE ONLY WAFFLE IN EXISTENCE. Bragg's is my favorite downtown breakfast joint. I think people are thrown off by this new wave of unconventional casual food places. Sit wherever you want, menus on the tables, really chill and cute servers. I love the atmosphere and like that I can get breakfast at 4pm. Even if you go for some iced toddy (amazing) and a slice of pie, there's no other place in Phoenix like it!"}
{"text":"Bragg's Factory Diner has definitely hit the nail on the head with delicious pies. I tried the key lime and the French pear tart. The key lime pie was the perfect balance of tart and sweet. The crust was amazing. The French pear was my favorite. The pears were baked to the perfect consistency. Sweet and slightly firm instead of just being sugar mush. Their coffee was fabulous as well.  The decor was absolutely adorable. Every table is adorned with vintage salt and pepper shakers. The walls are decorated with old photos of Phoenix. Very charming.   I can't wait to go back to try out their lunch menu!"}
{"text":"We first tried Bragg's a week or so after it opened. It was a thousand degrees outside (and inside, too), the place was packed, and we waited a lonnnngggg time.   We hadn't realized that it was their first week in business, so we decided to give them another try once they smoothed everything out.  OH MY GOSH.  I'm so glad we went back this past week for brunch.   A friend had posted that he had the best vegan pumpkin french toast there a few days before, so I was instantly intrigued. When I inquired I was told that they were a special item, and that on that day the special was pomegranate chocolate pancakes!  WHAT.  Needless to say, my entire breakfast was perfection. Homemade, not too sweet, not too bitter, perfectly refreshing lemonade? I'll take three glasses, please. The pancakes came out quickly and were cooked just right-still soft, but definitely done through the center, and covered in fresh pomegranate seeds and a light dusting of powdered sugar. The rosemary potatoes that I had ordered as a side were perfectly browned without being burned, and heartily seasoned. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  My husband ordered an egg breakfast burrito and toast, which he said was incredible. The toast that came out was thickly cut and looked so good I had to steal a few bites in between my own carbo-loaded meal.   Service was quick, extremely friendly, and attentive. As it was on our first visit, the place was neat and clean and seemed to run very efficiently.   I'm so glad we went back to Bragg's, and I'm looking forward to visiting again and trying their lunch menu!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast of almond pancakes!  Small stack was just perfect for me.  $8.  Lovely outdoor table & smiling waitresses!  PS: Blueberry/apple pie (to go) was awesome too. Thanks!!!!!"}
{"text":"Bragg's is located on Grand Ave -- one of the only streets in Phoenix today that has a painted bike lane (not especially relevant to this review, but since I like to bike places when I can, I did make a note of this street feature).    The establishment is located in a triangular/angular building making the layout unique. And the vibe and look reminded me of an old-school \"diner.\"  The service was friendly and educational - especially to those of us who aren't gluten-free, vegetarians, or soy aficionado's.   We went on a Thursday evening around 6:30pm.    I'm not a vegetarian but I play one on TV.   Not really.  I just felt like I had have a disclaimer in place to prove that I came here, not because I have limited food choices, but more so because I wanted to expand my food choices (if that makes sense).     Prior to our first visit, I had never had soyrizo (Chorizo).   I thought it was delicious and have now replaced my chorizo recipes at home with soyrizo.   I'm sure my Mexican-mom would be able to tell the difference, but my hubby and son couldn't so we are good to go on the path to slowly improving our food choices.  Our family agreed that the \"Koo Koo Banana pancakes\"  won the \"best meal award\" with an awesome flavor that included rum and brown sugar caramelized bananas.   For those of us who live in South Phoenix/Laveen, Braggs is located a quick 20 minute drive from the south-west side of town.   We will come back."}
{"text":"I've been to arts and craft shows, art galleries, and school dances at Bragg's Pie Factory. To me, Bragg's represents what has become a great community center.   I love the space and location. When I hear that an event is at Bragg's, I'm always happy to attend."}
{"text":"Drove 30 min and did not disappoint ! Came in for breakfast and had the frank Lloyd bite. It was delicious . Definitely coming again. Fresh food wonderful customer service very welcoming"}
{"text":"A cool little spot located on eccentric and art-filled Grand Ave, Bragg's has some of the best veg food! Try the avocado sandwich and definitely get yourself a piece of pie afterwards."}
{"text":"The wait here is ridiculous. 50 minutes?! Never coming here again. Late for work thanks."}
{"text":"We tried to get in a few times before finally lucking into an empty table on a Saturday afternoon. The reviews for this place were impressive and we had high hopes! I soon came to find out why it was always packed: it takes forever.  I don't want to take away from the quality of the food. The meals are delicious. Vegan. Creative. Fresh. I loved the eggs with spinach and pesto. Every bite was a mouth party. DH ordered the short stack of banana pancakes and I stole forkfuls. The side of fresh fruit was bursting with flavor. I enjoyed my grilled veggies so much that I ordered more. But getting the attention of our server was a challenge. There are about ten tables in the restaurant and at least two servers yet getting refills was a monumental task. He was pleasant and kindly. But not attentive. And as we sat and waited, and waited more, we noticed that few of the tables were actually moving. There is a lack of server skills that is preventing the kind of turnover that empties tables for the next customer.  In the end, it was a great meal and we will be back. I just want to emphasize that if this is the norm, this delicious food comes with a price. Your time."}
{"text":"Pretty damned good vegan and vegetarian food for not a whole lot of green. Courteous and attentive staff. Solid music choices at an acceptable volume level. Kind of limited menu, but hey they've also got cruelty free pies. Space is also limited, but that just makes it easier for me to get work done while I wait for the delectables to arrive at the table."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a couple months, first just for something new, now it's due to dietary restrictions...either way I have nothing but praise. They always help when I need to know what ingredients are used.  We tend to stick to a few regular dishes, I love the Early Birdrito and the Bwiscuits and Gwavy.   Baked goods never disappoint, especially the peanut butter and chocolate pie!"}
{"text":"This place could not be better. The food is so delicious I wake up wanting it and I'm not even vegan. The menu is so unique with really interesting parings it is hard to choose. The staff is amazing and completely engaged. It feels like a place you can sit and sip (super delicious) coffee without being rushed out. It is very low key, relaxed and comfortable. I've been there MANY times and plan to return MANY more!  highly recommend the goat cheese pancakes but seriously everything is to die for!"}
{"text":"I love the ABLT and the deserts the best. These guys know how to serve it up.  I suspect you will love their creations and the prices are nice and reasonable.  If you go at the very end of the day, I think some of their deserts are discounted...I think."}
{"text":"I love this place the environment is nice, the staff and and the owners are great. The food is exceptional and the last time we went the chef was creating a new jalapeño waffle with strawberries. It was delicious although I am normally a nacho guy when I go there. I love going there as often as I can which is maybe once a month as I live in Chandler. Kudos to the staff and Owners!"}
{"text":"My partner brought me here for my birthday last year and I brought him here for his birthday this year. It is a bit far from us, so we make a special occasion out of it.  This is really unique place with very unique food. I love the Curry Waffles and Supreme Nachos! My partner ate the this Red Beet Burger that was very special. It was really red and yummy. I have to ask them to VEGANIZE them because they have like 2 dishes with eggs, but they are always accommodating.   The place is super cute with home-made desserts that are always vegan. Across the street is the parking lot with the most awesome graffiti that I always like to take pictures of. I love the area. We walked around the streets before and after dinner. There are little fruit and veggie plants that are being planted all the time in the front yards of the restaurant. I heard the owner walks and waters them every day. That is AWESOME.  If you drive a little bit, you will see a green bike lane! They really put a lot of effort to making the space very nice...  The price is fair and reasonable. I do hope they expand their menu though. It is a bit small, but I do love their breakfast choices. It is awesome to see Vegan varieties like that."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped by Bragg's Factory Diner today for some vegan deliciousness. We were promptly greeted and invited to sit at any empty table. The place was bright and airy, with lots of windows. The dining area was quite warm. I hope they crank up the a/c during the warmer months.   I ordered the iced toddy and the Early Birdito with a side of hash browns. Holy vegan explosion of awesomeness in my mouth. The food was scrumptious! The burrito was large and filling. The hash browns were crispy and perfect.   The service was quick and friendly. We were asked many times if we were ok or needed anything. My glass of water was always at least half full.   When paying the bill (which was only $18.50 for 2 people and 2 drinks--a steal!), I met the owner, the cook, and the pastry chef. What a bunch of friendly folks making delicious food!!!!   I was too full to try any of their desserts, which means I will definitely have to return..and soon!"}
{"text":"I'm not entirely convinced this is really vegan and/ or vegetarian food. It just tastes too good. I love breakfast food, and this place serves it all day! Woo hoo!  I heartily recommend the french toast--So good, I had it twice in a row. The hint of citrus with their maple syrup--yum!  I decided to branch out and try the waffles, they were delicious, but it is kind of weird to actually taste the curry part of coconut curry. Don't think I've ever had waffles that can be described as \"slightly spicy\" before. But you know--it worked.   It's got kind of a 50's vibe going on, especially at night. The servers are super friendly and if they aren't busy, the food comes out pretty fast. I think we got spoiled the first couple times that we went there since we had the place to ourselves. I couldn't figure out why this place wasn't totally hopping, but when I went in on a Saturday afternoon, it felt like a completely different place--they were slammed, and they seemed a little overwhelmed; I was surprised that they weren't a little more organized-- though busy, it took entirely too long for anyone to even acknowledge us. I'm going to cut them some slack, though, I know they had recently put out a groupon, so maybe they really weren't used to being so busy.  Each time I have gone, they've had a different dessert, and all I can say: WOW. The chocolate chili pudding (something like that) and the Peanut Butter Chocolate pie--How are you doing this without animal products!?? Soooo good. I also recommend the \"Nopalace like home\" if you are more of a sandwich person. I'm not, but I had a bite of my friend's and considered becoming a sandwich person...:) (Or rather, someone who likes to eat sandwiches. It kinda sounds weird to say a sandwich person.)  Overall--great place, I will definitely be back again. And again. And again after that! :)"}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch when visiting from Tucson and it was great! Unlike most vegan/vegetarian restaurants, this one really has a diner style. The menu is limited, the dining room is small, but it's in a funky location with a unique feel. I had the \"ELT\" which was eggplant \"bacon\" with lettuce and tomato on toasted sourdough - the eggplant wasn't crispy, but it was smokey and delicious.   Overall, I thought it was a nice turn off the beaten path of super trendy vegan restaurants."}
{"text":"I love how they have breakfast all day long. The staff is super nice too. The pancakes are soooo good and the hashbrowns are über crispy. I got the ELT and it was delicious. My sister got the chocolate peanut butter pie and it was to die for. Green and braggs are hands down the best vegan restaurants in phoenix. It was my first time here and i will for sure be a returning customer. IM OBSESSED"}
{"text":"Bragg's is one of my favorite places to eat.  It is a bit of a drive but well worth it.  The place is small and located near some funky art galleries.  I like its atmosphere and there is ample parking.  Last night bf and I both had the Secret Wonder Bat with Rosemary Potatoes.  You would never have know there was no meat in that sandwich.  The combination of portobello mushroom with sauer-apple-kraut made it exceptionally flavorful.   I followed that with a chocolate almond torte.  I like the sandwich better but I wouldn't knock the torte.  Next time I plan to try one of their vegan pies which they are more known for. If you are looking for good vegan eateries, put this one on your list.   I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! They have great food, treats, and service. I also enjoy their strive for diversity and the ambiance makes you feel right at home. This is a must stop and a regular place of mine now"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place! I'm vegan and it's hard to find a place I can eat with my boyfriend who isn't and doesn't eat Tofu or Seitan. We both love this place. Their pies are heavenly and everything is so delicious. You gotta try the the Jack Fruit Barbacoa. All the staff are friendly and very down to earth, price extremely affordable. Very unique home style diner experience :)  My usual is Tofu Scramble with a short stack of the house pancakes, and a side of the Jack Fruit Barbacoa. Eat my pancakes first then mix the scramble and Jack fruit...MMM!"}
{"text":"I don't usually review places within the first week of opening, while they're still getting the kinks worked out, but I'm going to this time because it is THAT GOOD.   Most of the stuff here is vegan or can be made vegan by excluding cheese. The decor is way cute, and the food is tops. The scramble is one of the best I've had, the sandwiches I've tried have been delicious, the coffee is Xanadu (which is the best in town), and the pie...man, the pie. I had this slice of cappuccino pie that was basically the pie to end all pies.  Some of the stuff may sound a little weird, like curried cauliflower on a waffle. But trust me, one bite and you will be a believer."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best vegan restaurants in Phoenix. Hands down. The food was terrific, I had the Bwiskits and Gwavy. My wife had the banana rum pancakes. I don't think I've had such a great brunch in a very long time. My biscuits were fluffy and not dense, and the poblano gravy was very satisfying. My wife's pancakes were absolutely delicious - the rum banana glaze was extra tasty. My only negative for this place is that there was not much seating, which means you need to get here early! I highly recommend this place, Vern of not, you will leave here happy and full."}
{"text":"Love, love, love! Not a vegetarian? It doesn't matter: this place is amazing, regardless. I went for the first time and came back two other times that week. The vegetarian reuben may be the best sandwich i have ever had. The beet burger rocks. The kale salad was so good that i've been trying to replicate it at home. The breakfast options are pretty standard breakfast fare, but really good. The curry waffles couldn't be better. A lot of restaurants have come and gone on Grand Avenue and in this cool little location. I really hope the diner can realize it's plans and get enough business to expand to later hours. Don't be turned off by the location on Grand Ave or by the lack of pork. Give it try. You may discover your new favorite Central Phoenix restaurant like I did!"}
{"text":"I tried this place again because I was in the area and I needed a place to hang out and grab a bite to eat.  I ordered the curry coconut waffle and fresh fruit.  The waffle was very doughy just as my pancakes were from October 2013.  I informed the waiter and he took my plate and made me another.  However, the second was still doughy, but not as bad as the first.  I didn't send the second one back, but I should have.  I won't go back for breakfast the next time I'm in the area.  I haven't tried the lunch and am willing to give that a try since my son's sandwich looked great and he enjoyed it.  Stay away from the pancakes and waffles!"}
{"text":"If you are an asshole eat at Bragg's. It will make you a better person."}
{"text":"Far and away, my place to eat away from home, my favorite in all the U. S.  May the people and establishment remain forever. So thankful for the humans that keep it running. I love every part of the whole that is Bragg's. Devastating dishes celebrate raw material; simplicity bewitched by culinary complexity, extravagance and love. Thank you for sharing. Thanks to the universe you are in my town of residence. I come back to parade you to the unenlightened. When in surgery, you will be my final and first meal when I awake. No shit."}
{"text":"Super friendly. Avocado sando and what the Waff were delicious."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. They just recently opened (same kids who owned Sweets 'n Beats) and their menu is vegan-friendly. I had the fruity ol' goat- almond pancakes with goat cheese and strawberries and their fruit salad (best one I've had in a while) for my side. This was AMAZING. Beyond amazing. I crave it and want it all the time (!!!) The boyfriend got the 'What the waff?!' -  coconut curry waffles with hash browns. His portion was smaller than mine, and was not as colorful but he was satisfied. Their lunch menu looks tasty, too, so we are sure to come back.   They are only open until 2pm, so we can only come here on the weekends. I hope they expand their hours because the food was out of this world! The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is due to the hour-long wait for our food. We were there during the craft fair and their kitchen was backed up. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My mom and I visited Bragg's a week ago for breakfast and enjoyed our visit. The food was very tasty.  My mom had the banana pancakes and I ordered french toast - both vegan dishes.  We cleaned our plates :)  The wait staff was polite and attentive - I had read reviews stating that it takes a long while to get food - not the case for us and the place was full(small space though!) when we got there.   I will go again and try their lunch/dinner menu."}
{"text":"First time here and I enjoyed it. It's a very small space but they were very nice & accommodated me and my wheelchair. We sat the biggest table which is right smack in the middle of the room. It was a very hot day and the building is mostly windows. Which made it a little warm inside.  I ordered the big nachos with the jackfruit. I've never had jackfruit and it was very tasty. It definitely gave the nachos a different flavor. That was also my first time having all vegan nachos and they were so good. My daughter had the pancakes and she cleared her plate! I was dying to try the desserts but will have to come back soon to try."}
{"text":"The menu has a great twist, lots of options for every diet.  Don't come if you're in a hurry, the servers are sweet.  I got the classic with hash browns.  They make their own ketchup which is truly heavenly.  I'd definitely return!"}
{"text":"I came here because my sister told me that she had the best pancakes of here life here. So obviously I had to check it out.... She was RIGHT.  I don't know what's up with Phoenix but they have so many restaurants with such interesting ATMOSPHERES. Bragg's was no different. It is the quirky corner shaped restaurant that is also unassuming and causal. Saw a couple families with babies here as well as young couples and middle aged people... good mix!  I ORDERED the koo-koo banana pancakes (flax pancakes with brown sugar and rum caramelized bananas)  with the rosemary potatoes. The short stack comes with two pancakes and they were PERFECT.... beautifully crisp on the outside and just amazingly doughy on the inside. The bananas were beautiful and went well with the rum sauce. Unfortunately I found the sauce to be too sweet and was scraping some of it off the pancake so I could enjoy how perfect the pancakes were on their own. The potatoes were just right.. infused and cooked with rosemary.   The SERVICE was ok. When they are at your table, taking your order, or bringing you food they were so sweet and helpful. However, after that they were kind of negligent... and we were sad."}
{"text":"Ever since I saw a poetry performance across the way from this joint I had been wanting to get in and try it out.  The first time I stopped in, I was greeted and told to grab a seat wherever.  I looked over the menu and was pleased to see that everything was either vegan or vegetarian (depending on if you wanted eggs or tofu).  I usually opt for the biscuits and gravy when I have breakfast.  The gravy is vegan and not thickened with flour so if you want it on top of something gluten-free, like potatoes, you're good to go.  It's not just any old gravy, no no, it has corn and roasted poblano chiles in it.  I like to get the rosemary potatoes as my side, but they have others to choose from.  I usually grab a cup of joe, which they serve with regular cream, almond or soy milk.  On my most recent trip, I finally came in for lunch.  Excellent, because I  had been thinking about the barbacoa jackfruit and nopales sammich for a gooooood while.  Basically, jackfruit is a fruit (duh) that has a meaty texture and is very good at absorbing favors.  So, the jackfruit is slightly spicy and is topped with grilled nopales (cactus) and vegan mayo.  I will admit, that while it was tasty, it wasn't as good as I had hoped.  Also, on this particular trip, my server took my order and then never came back...it was a little odd.  Getting a coffee refill can be a chore sometimes, unless Chela (Chayla? Cheyla?) is working, cause she's awesome.  I haven't tried any of their homemade pies/cakes yet, but I'm sure I will soon.  All of the baked goods are vegan...so it's inevitable."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. The entire menu is great, food is delicious and vegan. I am hooked on the koo koo banana pancakes like you would not believe. I pretty much tell everyone about them, except I cant really describe it accurately. I have been in the morning, wasnt crowded, and good atmosphere. They also hold simpsons trivia nights."}
{"text":"I was in AZ for business and luckily had a few hours of down time to go exploring. Yelp is the best tool for anyone to have when you aren't sure of specific spots to go, and it came in handy yet again. I found a whole street (Roosevelt) filled with coffee shops, markets, and art. Bragg's was close by, and the reviews and their menu looked awesome..so that was my destination for lunch.  I could feel the vibe from this spot at first glance. This building itself is a piece of art. The decorated planters, the hanging art...the vibe is so awesome. The establishment sits on a triangular corner, and the interior space is minimal, but you are surrounded on both sides by full windows that fill the dining area with light in the daytime. There are a few tables lined up on the sidewalk outside as well..very cool setup altogether.  I saw so many items on the menu that I wanted to try, but I was still in a breakfast mode so I went with the scrambled tofu with a side of eggplant bacon. The waitress was very helpful. The service kind of an extension of the building itself..very cheerful and welcoming!  The tofu scramble was very well done. Mixed with grilled onions and peppers...it was the perfect dish to fill up on. The eggplant bacon was real good too. It didn't really have a bacon taste, but the texture was similar to a well done piece of bacon. It wasn't crisp, but it had that chewy texture to it. A perfect side dish for the tofu.  I was talked into trying a piece of pie (OK, it wasn't hard to convince me) and the triple berry was suggested...I went with it! It was soooo good. The tartness of the berries mixed with the flakiness of the crust was awesome! I couldn't believe that they got a vegan crust to be this flaky!!! This was definitely the best part of my meal...and it was all good!  Bragg's is definitely on my list of places to stop by whenever I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Soo good! Amazing veg eats & healthy for you. Love love love it! Prices are fab as well. My husband & I go here regularly for lunch & spend 20$ -- so perfect! My fav sandwich is the portobello Ruben !! I need to try other items but am just addicted to this. Yum!"}
{"text":"The food that we got was good.  We had heard great things about this place from friends and had a groupon so decided to give it a try.  We were the only one's there when we got there, so we were surprised when it took almost 45 minutes to get our food once we did order.  They did not have our first choice, so had to make some changes, but it was very good once we did get it.  Will give it another try...maybe Saturday night is not the time to go?  Only two of us, which should not have been much of a challenge.  The lemonade was excellent!"}
{"text":"Quiet place at 7:30 on a Wed night. The host/waitress was attentive and sweet. The gluten free banana chocolate waffle was to die for. I'd pay $9 for that again!"}
{"text":"So gross and super small portions of overly seasoned food. The salad dressing was good tho. Won't be coming back anyhow. Sage is much better."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. I'm not vegan and no longer vegetarian but live very close. The service seems to take a pretty long time regardless if anyone else is in there with you or not. One time there was only two other tables and we waited an hour for our food (there was only two of us.) The waitress, however was very polite and apologized. I still give it 3 stars because the food is always good even though it takes longer than I think it should and the girls are always very friendly.   I love the decor. It's so kitchy and fun. All the mugs are different and they have a jackalope hanging over the entry way. I also just love the story of Braggs in general and love to support local business."}
{"text":"When I was a young man driving across America, I developed a lovely relationship with Waffle House.  Now that I am a married man planning on having children, I try to eat fresh plant-based foods more often.    Bragg's Factory Diner is - forks over knives - the best vegetarian breakfast and lunch spot in Phoenix.  They serve everything a highway diner should: eggs, hashbrowns, pancakes and waffles, and an array of sandwiches.  Other than the eggs and the occasional slice of cheese on a sandwich, the menu is VEGAN, and they do not skimp on flavor and taste.  The kitchen staff must have been chemists before they opened, because they figured out how to properly execute a vegan BLT (using a vegan marinade on eggplant that is comparable in taste and texture to crispy, delicious bacon).  Oh, and the diner is located in a quaint historic pie factory.  Much to my delight and Waffle House \"nostalgialust\" - Bragg's Factory Diner does have pie and they serve it from a refurbished 1950's style rotating pie-case.  Pie-case, now there's a device we don't see anymore.  Oh, and the pie is also vegan with a flaky pastry crust that will keep your slice intact and gooey contents contained.  The coffee is delicious, the staff is nice/young/hip, and the decor pays homage to the Arizona days of yore.  Why are you still reading this?  Go stuff your pie-hole!"}
{"text":"versatile event space on Grand Ave., liked its modern warehouse feel, was here for Without Apologies show. DJ put on a great set, acoustics seemed fine. Paisley Violin is just down the street, as is Sapna Cafe. currently featuring some interesting art from Unwasted Recycled Rubbish Show. ample street parking."}
{"text":"This was such a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!  We came here for breakfast on a Sunday morning.  We decided to try a variety of items.    I ordered the \"Freedom Toast\" with \"Spiced and Sliced\" - it was just okay.  Definitely nothing to \"bragg\" about.  My husband ordered the \"Frank Lloyd Bite\".  His pancakes were very tasty - by far the best of all the food we tried. The hash browns were strange - how do you mess up hash browns? The biscuit and gravy was not very good at all as they were dry and not very flavorful.  The eggplant bacon was absolutely horrible!!!    We also ordered the vegan sausage patties and the jackfruit barbacoa - AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!!!  My husband takes one bite and says \"Yuck. Here you try this! You can't believe how bad this is!\" So I take a bite of each and he is not exaggerating, they are so disgusting.   As we are sitting there, we look up and notice the air intake for the A/C unit is covered in at least 1\" of dirt/dust.  Ewwww!!!  The rest of the restaurant is \"decorated\" and I use that word loosely in funky décor; especially the bathroom with the plastic/yarn items.  We both had upset stomachs after we left.  We will not be back.  I would give this place 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"There was a big roach near us inside! Food was ok... Wouldn't eat there again! Customer service is the only thing that deserves the stars!"}
{"text":"I checked out this place today for lunch when I was super hungry.  Ordered the Sweets and Beats salad with avocado added.  It was delicious.  Ordinarily, that would have been enough to satisfy me.  But I was starving because I hadn't eaten in several hours.  So I ordered this beet burger (not \"beef,\" but \"beet\").  I've never had one of those before.  The patty is made with red beets and a bunch of other stuff (I don't remember exactly what was in that patty).  It was topped with corn and other various tasty toppings.  It was also very very delicious.    The people there are very friendly.  And the lady who took my first order had the same first name as my last name.  Not that that really matters.  I'm just trying to be thorough.  My friend Steve had salad and rhubarb pie.  He thought that was great also.  I said to Steve, \"I don't recall ever in my life eating rhubarb.  Not once.  I couldn't even tell you what a rhubarb looks like!\"  Steve was shocked.  He described rhubarb to me.  I think I might try that next time.  I've got to try rhubarb at some point, so I might as well make it an experience at Bragg's Factory Diner."}
{"text":"Love breakfast at Bragg's the banana pancakes and the curry tofu are my two favorites.  Always good food and they always have a special to check out"}
{"text":"Decided to chance it on Mother's Day.  Got there around 9, was mildly surprised we got a table right away.  Good timing, too - about 20 minutes later, the place was packed.  We were served pleasantly and efficiently.  Has a throwback look to it - it really is a diner.  Sure, everything is vegetarian, but their food should appeal to veggies, vegans and everyone.  Unless, you know, you don't like food.  They you're stuck.    I had the Early Birdito (with tofu) with OJ, my wife had the What The Waff?! with the potatoes, my mother-in-law tried the Frank Lloyd Bite with the fruit salad and my oldest daughter had the Avocado Sando with chips.  Everyone enjoyed everything.    I think the 5-star dish here is the waffles.  As much as I liked my breakfast burrito, next time I'll be trying those, or the goat cheese pancakes (which no one tried on this trip).  My daughter scarfed down the sandwich and then stole some of my rosemary potatoes.  the Frank Lloyd Bite is really more of a sampler platter.  If you order that, I hope you're really hungry.  All in all, a successful trip.    The previous description of it as low key is on the money.  Really liked the feel of the place."}
{"text":"Small cute vegan place in what looks like a warehouse building. I ordered the beet brag burger and my husband got the avocado sandwich. I also ordered eggplant bacon. Everything was to perfection, I actually wished I got the avocado because was so good!! There's a lot of rosemary in it which made it even more delicious. The beet burger was on a toasted bun and the waitress brought out homemade ketchup they made that day, finger licking good! The eggplant bacon is eggplant that is roasted to a crisp..soooo gooood!!! Ask for their lemonade to, very nice. :))) can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"The food is consistently delicious. I know it can be a challenge to make vegan food great, and this place definitely has it down! The servers are friendly. The parking is convenient. Great ambience with fun and funky decor."}
{"text":"I've been looking for the hidden gems of vegan cuisine in this city since I moved here. There's some \"mostly ok\" or \"pretty good\" places around, and more than a few \"this is vegan but it isn't good and/or healthy\" choices. Bragg's Diner puts them all to shame.  Delicious, fresh ingredients. Tried the barbacoa jackfruit ($2?! Did I mention this place is VERY reasonably priced for what you are getting), immediately ordered the Nacho Man Randy Savage with more on top. I tried the avocado sando (ok I admit that I cheated and added one slice of Swiss), amazingly delicious sandwich.   Left STUFFED full of great tasting vegan food, and took home a sampler of vegan desserts from their bakery cabinet. Vegan donuts and muffins for breakfast the next day were a total hit. Please show this restaurant some love and help support one of my new favorite vegan places in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great.Freakin.Food. Nacho Man Randy Savage!? I mean, seriously, with a name like that, how could you go wrong!?"}
{"text":"The two stars are only because of the very very poor service we had last evening (and the undercooked potatoes) .......otherwise the menu items we have tried are fantastic and in other experiences the service has been great!    Hubby and I ate a couple of weeks ago for lunch - we loved it.... the food, the ambience, the service was awesome....    We took our 23 year old daughter last night (around 4:30) for early dinner because we wanted her to try the jackfruit barbacoa.....  We walked in and a young lady was cleaning off the plant stand.  My husband had opened the door for us and he asked her if she was going out (she had plants in her hands) and she said, \"No, I work here.\"  (We knew that!)  Then told us to find a seat.  We sat down, she continued to clean up the plants and told us the drinks were on the back the menu.  After she was done with the plants she came over and asked if anything looked good.  I told her it all looked great and she said, \"Drink-wise.\"  The three of us ordered lemonade (which is delicious!)  We ordered our meals and we all loved our food except most of our potatoes were undercooked - way undercooked.   My husband also had to ask for the two sides of pickled jalapeno we had ordered.....  Our server seemed upset.  Not sure why though.  I had a feeling that our server was having a bad day or something was upsetting her and I decided not to take it personal, enjoy my meal and ask her how she was the next time she came around.....  However....... I changed my mind when another table of three young men came in.......boy, she was right there, got their waters and lemonade and even helped them when they spilled their water.    We were never asked if we wanted any re-fills on our lemonades.  The table of young men were offered re-fills.  (When we had come in for lunch previously- we were offered re-fills several times!)      We asked for a to-go box for our daughter's sandwich but our server took the picked jalapeno before we had a chance to put it in our box.  (We were charged extra for the jalapeno because it is an additional side dish).    We paid, and we left a tip, but we will not be back - not because of the undercooked potatoes.....  because of the server.    We are not sure why she had such disdain for us - but we got the feeling we were not the clientele she deems appropriate for the restaurant.  Granted our tattoos were not showing and we were dressed in our work clothes.... that is still not any excuse for the air of superiority and very, very poor service.  So if you see a young woman with dark hair, nasal septum piercing, wearing glittery Doc Martens do not even bother unless you are a 20 something without your parents....."}
{"text":"Try it! Good food, art area and excellent service! Only Swiss or house made vegan nacho cheese for sandwiches, Goat cheese in the salads."}
{"text":"Such a good Vegan/Vegetarian place to stop near I - 10! We had the Secret Wonder Bat and Nacho - Man Randy Savage with added Jackfruit. Both are amazing!! They even have yummy desserts!"}
{"text":"Delicious spin on vegan cuisine. I enjoyed the nopales & jackfriuit sandwich with it's crsips texture and savory flavors! I love the bacon eggplant, but I think the name \"bacon\" will throw some people off since it's just grilled eggplant."}
{"text":"Food was great and reasonably priced.  Some really imaginative stuff on the menu.  Not everything we ordered was a home-run, but the Portobello Reuben was great and the biscuits and gravy were very good.  Staff was friendly, attentive and knew the menu well.  A previous reviewer talked about the wait staff lacking professional polish; that's probably fair to some degree, but it doesn't mean the service wasn't good... just different.  Location is out of the way, but everything in Phoenix is kind-of out of the way; hopefully that won't hurt Bragg's chance at survival."}
{"text":"I ate back here awhile ago and I loved that everything on their menu was vegan!! And very yummy for vegan too. Luckily I heard from a friend that this little spot tucked into Grand Avenue is great not just for pies but for an awesome breakfast and lunch. I can't even remember what I had because it was quite a few months ago but I remember I enjoyed every bit. Make sure to support this local business and fill your tummy with the delicious eats Bragg's Factory Diner has to offer!"}
{"text":"Wonder bat sandwich. Holy yum yum batman! Potato salad please. Peach pie to go? Why yes ma'am. Honest food served in a simple way by great people."}
{"text":"I've found a new breakfast spot! I was wanting to try Bragg's as they offered a lot of vegan options. Ever since I found out I was lactose intolerant, I've stopped eating waffles and pancakes, and have always gone with a boring egg option as it's one of the few breakfast options that doesn't include cows milk.   We came here for brunch, it's a quaint little diner, with about 10 tables. They have a rotating desert fridge, which reminds me of the diners I went to as a kid and they had kitchy salt shakers of a different form on every table.  I was torn with what to order as everything sounded good, so I asked my server what she recommended. She said the curry waffles were a good option, and same with the almond pancakes with strawberries and goat cheese. I ordered the waffle and my husband had the pancakes. Both were very good and we did not miss the dairy! The waffle was a perfect mix of sweet and savory with a hint of curry flavor, it really worked. My husband's pancakes were cooked well and were light and fluffy. The prices were reasonable too, two entrees and two iced teas for $20. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"First of all, let me start by saying I am so sad it took me so long to find this place!  My wife and I decided to try this out since we were tired of the same vegan options around the Valley, and we were not disappointed.  She had the jackfruit barbacoa and - due to a pretty bad allergy with jackfruit - I had the bwiscuits and gwavy.  Both of us were so impressed with this food we didn't even speak throughout our meal.  We left room for dessert because we've heard these pies are to die for.  Unfortunately, by the time we ended up going the only choice left was the apple and rosemary.  Fortunately, it was phenomenal.  The crust, the flavors, the melt-in-your-mouth goodness.  Yes, please.  This place is awesome and we will most definitely tell our friends to join us on our next trip back."}
{"text":"The ambiance is adorable and the wait staff friendly. I was excited to try the eggplant bacon, unfortunately it was cold when it arrived. There was a long wait for the food so it was annoying that some was cold. The hash browns came out late and were bland and undercooked in the middle. My date enjoyed the pancakes a lot. I would go back to see if it was an off day but I think the kitchen may need more support."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot in my heart for all of my entrpreneurial friends working so hard to make Grand Avenue a great place to work and shop.  This was a horrible neighborhood for the longest time...and bit by bit, it's turning into something unique and a destination in its own right.  I have been to the fashion show during the Grand Avenue Street Fair as well as the Mutant Pinata exhibit (my personal favorite).  The venue is roomy...great for exhibits and gatherings.  I also enjoy visiting friend Kate Benjamin's Moderncat Studios behind the main venue.  The neighborhood is still up and coming and as a single female I do prefer to head down there with a companion.  I have been down there a few times when I've had to deal with inebriated street types who were probably harmless but disarming nevertheless.  But the point of supporting them is precisely to turn the neighborhood around and change the element.  Be sure to venture off the main drag on a First Friday and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"My favorite vegan veggie burger in town is their beet burger. It is a little bit on the mushy side but with the poblano \"cheese\" and sesame toasted bun, it's insanely delicious.   I've also had their vegan biscuits and gravy. Don't expect any fake sausage in these. Their eggplant bacon is pretty good as well.   Overall this place has an amazing concept for healthy alternatives to typical diner food. Great for non-vegans/vegetarians/omnomnomnivores as well!!"}
{"text":"First time here & we absolutely loved it!  My boyfriend had the Secret Wonder Bat sandwich and said it was extremely tasty!  He was intrigued by the eggplant \"bacon\" so he ordered a side of it.  We both agree with one of the previous reviews that this did fall a little flat.  But he loved the fresh lemonade and when he asked how they made it the waitress went and got the exact mixture from the baker so my boyfriend felt that more than made up for the \"bacon\".  I ordered the Frank Lloyd Bite which was delicious,  but A LOT of food.   My boyfriend had to help out!!!  With this one,  the pancakes were by far my favorite but I also enjoyed the Rosemary potatoes and the bwiscuit & gwavy side!  We'll definitely be back to this charming diner!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a new favorite local spot of mine. Their vegan / vegetarian fare was top-notch. The city of Phoenix can always use more locally-owned, veggie joints. I loved their comfy vibe inside the diner and the pies are scrumptious. I will be stopping in regularly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A vegan diner?  Go figure.  My friends and I were looking for grub after a morning golf outing nearby at Encanto.  I knew Bragg's was nearby, but admittedly didn't know much about their menu.  But since it was close we took a shot at it.  The place is small but easily visible on the corner of Grand & McKinley.  The interior is pretty nonchalant and seats no more than probably 15-20 at a time.    I had the french toast with citrus.  It doesn't look or taste like any french toast I've had before, but was delicious.  Their hash browns were good too, though not as hearty as I expected.  My friends had the biscuits and gravy as well as the scramble.  Again, totally vegan so no meat or byproducts in any of the dishes.  They too were impressed.  I knew this place used to be a pie factory so I decided to grab a slice.  The apple cranberry sounded amazing, but sadly they ran out earlier that morning.  So instead I had their strawberry cheesecake.  Again, its vegan so it didn't look or taste like any cheesecake I've had before (the strawberries were actually in the batter instead of on top), but once again a delicious surprise.    They take a lot of pride in saying they locally source their ingredients and scratch make their dishes and it shows.  The servers were incredibly friendly and helped explain the menu to everyone.  My friends and I are carnivores, but even we liked the food.  And if you're vegan or vegetarian, you'll go absolutely nuts for this place."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is casual and very cute. If your going for breakfast you have to try \"the classic\" it was amazing!! My only complaint was that it took FOREVER to get our food. It might have been a fluke because I didn't see anyone else comment about it. Regardless we will definitely go back! I want to try their vegan nachos!"}
{"text":"Alright ... pros and cons. Great looking corner diner next to a bunch of art galleries. They come up with a bunch of vegan/vegetarian dishes and have some pretty creative ideas on their menu. I got the Frank Lloyd Bite (nice tribute) and thought the pancakes were fantastic as well as the hash browns. They use eggplant as a side for \"bacon\". I found them good but a little on the cold side. I didn't care much for the side of biscuit with poblano gravy and the coffee was ok. So Bragg's is located in the Grand Ave district which is an area of town dedicated to the simple nostalgic ways of living. It makes this area unique and I enjoy seeing greasers cruise their vintage cars on occasional nights. But unless you have a big hipster beard, bed head and thrift store clothes on, you just aren't going to get the best service here as there is favoritism to the regulars in the area. My service was ok (10 min to get acknowledged after I sat down and another 10 to get a cup of coffee), but I have to wonder if I had a suit and tie on if I would even get served. I'll check them out again just because they get good reviews but I have to give a slight thumbs down for my first experience."}
{"text":"A check-out girl at Sprouts recommended this place. It looked interesting so I checked it out when my boyfriend came to visit me one weekend. The menu sounded exciting. Vegan biscuits and gravy, eggplant \"bacon,\" couldn't wait.   So I got the \" Early Birdrito\"  My mom got the \"Koo Koo Banana Pancakes\" My boyfriend got the \"Frank Lloyd Bite\"  Now what we do is usually share, take bites of each other's food, which I find to be a good way to get a sampling of multiple dishes to get a feel for the food.  The \"Frank LLoyd\" came with two pancakes, hashbrowns, eggplant \"bacon\" and biscuits and gravy. Pretty standard breakfast food. Nice fluffy pancakes, crispy hashbrowns, but the eggplant \"bacon\" was supposedly dehydrated although it was lightly seasoned and tasted like it was just roasted in the oven rather than dehydrated and was still wet. The flavor was eh. The biscuits and gravy were gross! No flavor whatsoever. That gravy was like wet, flavorless oatmeal, brown, chunky, sort of sweet from the corn. I'm sorry. I just couldn't do it.  The \"Bird Rito\" was a standard burrito with veggies and tofu egg replacement that YOU could probably make at home if so inclined. I have a vague memory of it. Can't complain. It was decent, but anyone could whip that up.  The best thing was the \"Koo Koo Banana pancakes.\" They had a great flavor with the rum and brown sugar caramelized bananas. Now that was memorable.   But the place is small and intimate, home-made, a real nice endeavor, but the food just wasn't that impressive so much that I wouldn't drive out again. I love that it's right there on the First Fridays route and everything and it's a total divey hipster kind of place, which fits right in, but I'm looking for taste, creativity beyond the title of the dish.  It was just okay, worth trying but not returning."}
{"text":"Heart in the right place ... kind of.  We're not vegan, but we don't eat meat always.  Just because something is a novel idea, doesn't mean that it's amazing (see: all other reviews, clearly).  This review may seem a bit like a slam to them, but after 10 highly rated reviews, we had to give it a shot.  The space is super cute.  I'm glad to see something go in, and attempt to help re-gentrify the area.  The decor is a mix of clean and diner - but not to heavy on anything, leaving it pretty neutral and approachable.  There are no meat products, and not that there has to be, but that cuts down your clientele a huge deal - bacon alone would change the game.  Nothing stood out as \"must have\".  We opted for the goat cheese pancakes with a side of hashbrowns.  Here's the thing about pancakes made without flour and eggs - they usually suck.  These were wet, gooey, and sticky.  Nothing fluffy, airy, or awesome about them.  The hashbrowns were seeping in oil; crispy on the outside, but wet and oil-soaked outside that thin crust.  Coffee was okay, but nothing to write  home about (perhaps better than the average diner's drip coffee).  I want to see this place succeed, but our experience was wonky and not delicious.  The service was a bit clumsy, and seemed like they'd never worked in a real customer service or restaurant establishment before.  In the end, despite wanting their 'dream' restaurant to work, it just felt like a bunch of Trunk Space kids doing their same ol' thing.  I hope to hear of things getting better here."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim and have continued to come back since. Great food, friendly service and the BEST vegan nachos EVER!!  Try the Jackfruit barbacoa and the French toast. YUM!  I am in love with this little hidden hem."}
{"text":"My mom, knowing my hipster-healthy dining preferences, recommended this place for a mid-week lunch together.    Everything we ordered was sublime! Simple, but the flavors were refined and it was easy to detect high-quality ingredients. We ordered the two salads on the menu and a side of veggies - we were practically licking our plates, and we're taking about greens and veggies here!! We finished our lunch off with a cookie and a brownie from their sight-for-sore-eyes bakery pantry - yummmmm :) Can't wait to try their brunch.  Hoping equivalently quirky and cheerful establishments start filing up nearby buildings, as this area definitely has potential."}
{"text":"I've now eaten at Bragg's twice in less than a month, and I can't wait to go back again soon. I was living in Australia when they opened, and one of the things I was most excited to return to Phoenix for (besides our lovely summer weather, of course) was to try out this place! Phoenix desperately needs more vegetarian/vegan places, and Bragg's is a fantastic addition.  Yes, it's in a part of town that isn't terribly nice (it's just a bit too far west to qualify as part of the hip downtown area), but the building itself is airy, well-lit, and very clean (including the bathrooms-I'm a huge stickler for clean and well-stocked bathrooms at restaurants). It's not a huge place, but I haven't had to wait either time I've gone (around mid-day on Sunday and Friday).   Their food is AWESOME and cheap! I think everything is less than $10, and the portions are large and include a side, at least for the breakfast dishes. The first time I went I had the Classic ($7), which is eggs or tofu with pesto, spinach, and tomato, with a side of fresh fruit. The Classic itself was very good and seemed to be made with fresh, high-quality ingredients, even if it wasn't anything unusual. As other Yelpers have mentioned, the fresh fruit side is awesome! Fruit sides can often be just meh with lackluster fruit and little variety, but this one is delicious, fresh, and had a good variety of fruit.   The second time I went, I got the What the Waff?!, which is a coconut-curry waffle ($7). YOU MUST TRY THIS WAFFLE! I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but it is unbelievably good. The waffle has a great texture, and the coconut-curry flavor is out of this world. Seriously, everyone needs to try these. I also got the eggplant bacon side, which is delicious! No, the texture isn't like bacon, but they really nailed the smoky, savory, salty flavor of bacon (at least from what I remember of bacon-I haven't eaten any for about 15 years now, but have had lots of veggie bacon).   My boyfriend got the Bwiscuits and Gwavy ($8) both times we went. He loved it! I thought it was decent, but I'm really not a big fan of biscuits and gravy in general. It's an enormous portion, so come hungry if you order this!   The servers are extremely friendly and cheerful, if perhaps slightly absent-minded. For example, the first time we came, our server forgot to bring my boyfriend his coffee. It was on the bill, but the server took it off when we pointed out that we'd never received the coffee, and apologized profusely. We had the same server the second time we came, and he did remember to bring us the coffee this time, and didn't charge us for it-we're not sure if he remembered the first time we visited and comped it intentionally, in which case, I would actually be very impressed by his memory and customer service! Either way, the service is great.   I haven't tried any of their pies or other baked goods yet, as I've been too full to do so both times I've come here. I look forward to doing so, though!  My only \"gripe\" (if you can even call it that) is that they're only open until 2 pm right now. However, my understanding is that they're looking to stay open later (maybe even 24 hours) down the road. So...all of you reading this should go to Bragg's so that they're successful enough to expand their hours! Seriously, go get that waffle. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Family ordered banana pancakes as well as a scramble. Both were spot on, with the pancakes being the star. The iced coffee was pure money. Ordered a chocolate coconut oatmeal cookie to go, which was nice and fresh.   Good service, attentive staff."}
{"text":"Came here today for my dad's birthday lunch before the Diamondbacks game and what a treat!  We loved everything... The nopales barbacoa jackfruit sandwich, the beet burger, french toast... So many good things. We weren't crazy about the eggplant bacon... We expected it to be crisp or chewy and have more smokiness... But it was a good side of eggplant nonetheless. Their housemade ketchup is really delicious and we loved how the sides of fruit had GOOD fruit, and not cantaloupe and honeydew centric as you often see.  Also, a really cool atmosphere and neighborhood. Definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"Wandered over to Bragg's today after a long morning downtown.  Dragged the Carnivore with me.  SCORE!  Crazy good banana pancakes with nicely seasoned hashbrowns.  A most excellent handling of eggplant on the E.L.T.   Since we were strategically placed NEXT to the rotating Delightful  Desserts Glass Case thingie-ma-bob we indulged in spiced pear pie and grapefruit icebox cookies - YUM to the Yum.  Nice little place.  Nice little menu. Nice peeps in front of and behind the counter! Super FRESH & TASTY.  Already thinking of friends we can bring here and impress with our new find!"}
{"text":"This place was ok. The service was great but the selection was extremely limited and the food was mediocre... not bad just not as great as I was expecting. I may go back but probably not as I have been to other vegan places with better food and a better selection."}
{"text":"We got the Gluten-Free Your Mind Waffle (banabread waffle with walnuts and chocolate chips) with the eggplant bacon and jackfruit barbacoa, and the Early Birdrito (burrito with quinoa amd hempseed chorizo) with rosemary potatoes, along with coffee and an iced toddy. Being out of tortillas, they were able to scramble the Birdrito and offered us a piece of pie to make up for it! Everything here is fantastic, from the coffee to the ketchup, the waffle to the REAL MAPLE SYRUP (only place I've found south of Minnesota to have it on our trip from NY). Do not pass up the Jackfruit Barbacoa; it's very savory and rounds out just about anything it's paired with. We also had some AMAZING blackberry nectarine pie - do not skip the pie.   The decor of the place is wonderful, with a cozy and chill atmosphere. Definitely not too trucker, nor too hipster. The auto place across the street has a pack of  chihuahuas as guard dogs,so that's cute, too.   The server is fantastic, the food is fantastic, the place is accessible, and the atmosphere is great. Five stars, without a question."}
{"text":"Cheap.  Healthy.   Great.   Perfect breakfast spot for 2 to 4.  Had Sunday family of 4 breakfast there and waffles and pancakes were outstanding.   Kids grilled cheese outstanding. Highly recommend banana pancakes.  Rosemary potatoes underdone a bit and just okay. Scramble and grilled veggies very good too with eggs. I'm not a vegan. Funky cool.  Great find. Easy street parking."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, I never would have known that this place was just less than a mile from work. There were only 7 customers including myself when I went the first time on a Thursday around 11:30 AM. There was only one waitress and she wasn't very attentive and was just matter of fact. I had the gluten free waffles. It was sweet and tasty, but it was dry. I also had a side of hash browns. It tasted good and crunchy just the way I like it, but it was drenched in so much oil. I wanted the eggplant bacon, but they were out of it that day. What saved my experience was the music they were playing which was late 90's to mid 00's ska and punk. I'll try this place out again because it's nearby and vegetarian and vegan."}
{"text":"As much as I thought the food was rather mediocre, I thought the service was amazing. The servers were nice and were checking in with me frequently. They had an extensive bakery menu, and everything was vegan and homemade. I had the gluten free pancakes, which were okay, and the potatoes on the side almost tasted a bit burnt. However, the service was so great that I gave this place 4 stars instead of 3."}
{"text":"Not sure how I feel about this place after 3 visits.  My first time trying was my bachelorette party dinner last year. Service and food were phenominal! I was so happy about this place and told my husband all about it!  When we returned we got a sassy server who was hard to find... even though there was only one other table in the place eating as well. I was accidenally served something non- vegan and the server didn't seem to care. I told her I was vegan, how could you not take care of this as a server? Anyway, I returned again with a friend and it was the same server who clearly didn't care. I'm a waitress as well, its not hard to fake a smile.  Will I return? Maybe. Its an hour drive from my house so maybe not. Even with a groupon i'm not sure it was worth it.  I've read about the owners and I know they mean well, I just think they could staff better. Get servers who care! I would have loved to talk to a manager about this experience but none were found each visit. :/"}
{"text":"I really liked this place! I ordered the Fruity Ol' Goat because of my love of all things Goat cheese related and it was very good. The pancakes were tasty and the fruit on top was nice and fresh. I ordered the eggplant bacon on the side and it was out of this world, though I really would not call it bacon. Not quite sure what I would call it..but it was good. There were a few downsides to the visit. First it was really small, maybe 7 to 8 tables with only one big one in the middle. The service was not so helpful, when asked if there was a wait the answer was yes with no estimate to how long of one until pressed. With that being said its a place I will probably visit again, as the good points were really good."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and wanted to be sure to hit up Bragg's. I wasn't disappointed in any way.  Tea was great, Nopales Like Home and Portobello Reuben were fantastic (with grilled veggies and cole slaw as sides), and I couldn't have imagine better pie (Bourbon Soaked Pecan and Bonnaffee Pie made for St Patty's Day -- traditional Irish pie with layered banana, caramel, and coconut whipped cream).  I'm glad that I made the effort to go here. I walked from downtown and it was a pleasant walk. The location itself was cute.  Highly recommended overall."}
{"text":"Bragg's has closed?  No!  It was my favorite place in Phoenix.  I feel like I've lost a good friend."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant!  My wife and I have gone several times and our favorite is the Wonder Bat, a vegetarian take on the reuben - we order it without cheese so it would be vegan.  Normally I'm not a fan of portobello mushrooms, but these are used in just the right amount.  Then it's topped with sauerkraut, thinly sliced green apples and vegan thousand island dressing.    The beet burger is also outstanding.  I've always been a fan of veggie burgers that in no way resemble a gray boca burger (like some other vegan places in town...)  It's truly delicious, and like the wonder bat it comes with a side of fruit, cole slaw, potato salad or chips.  The potato salad is my favorite.  We are so addicted to the sandwiches that we have not yet been able to try much off the breakfast menu yet but it looks great - biscuits and gravy, coconut curry waffles, tofu or eggs made several ways...  This place makes vegetarian and vegan food exactly like it should be made - not a big bowl of greasy fake meat, but instead vegetables prepared so that they can still be identified and seasoned perfectly."}
{"text":"Wonderful place!!  Excellent ole-timey ambiance, warm service and delicious, interesting vegan/vegetarian food choices!    We split the Frank Lloyd Bite:  savory, somehow buttery-tasting vegan pancakes + yummy hashbrowns + a biscuit with gravy (pretty yummy, although the biscuit part was just ok) + eggplant bacon (which really does have bacon flavor, despite looking like eggplant - yum!)  and the Scrambler: fire-roasted poblano, sauteed corn and onion  (using eggs rather than tofu eggs) - great flavor!  + a side - we got rosemary potatoes (light and good).   We also got a berry scone and a whoopie pie (all vegan) to go - exceptionally delicious when we ate them the next day.    Everyone who worked there was realy warm and genuine, in addition to knowledgable and efficient.  Great service.  We also ordered some sweet potato tamales for Christmas Eve - I'm sure they'll be delicious, too!  I have to admit, I'm really stingy with 5-star ratings and usually reserve them for places we've visited many times, so this place definitely impressed me.  It's my husband's (TroyH) new favorite breakfast place!  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy I decided to try this restaurant. The food was great and the staff was really friendly. I had the portobello mushroom Ruben with a side of cole slaw. It was delicious. I can't wait to go back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Really excellent. Service, food, value, and overall experience were all really good. I'm not vegan, but the food here is just awesome. I had the scrambler, and tasted the nachos with jackfruit barbacoa, and the strawberry and goat cheese pancakes, and you just can't go wrong. This is a great place, and a must try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Another reason to forego the hormone infested meat products of SAD (Standard American Diet)...... How can you not consider veggie food when more places in the valley show up like Braggs? Good, filling food without the animal product (or i should say no meat...there are some sandwiches with cheese if you want).  I had the Reuben....delicious, hearty mushrooms with sauerkraut on rye bread and a side of bbq breadfruit (which if you haven't tried bread/jack fruit, this is possibly the best way i've ever eaten bread/jackfruit).   the indoor dining area is small but cozy, although i came out smelling like the food i just ate. the surrounding area is full of local artist flair and kitsh(which we don't get much of here in our hood of scottsdale). lots of items on the menu....delicious options from breakfast, lunch, and brunch. and even pies! wow...another superb healthy option for us in town."}
{"text":"I'm hesitant to say this after only one visit but this might be the best breakfast I've ever ate in Phoenix.  I was a little apprehensive about ordering coconut curry waffles but took the server's recommendation.  Holy sh** they were awesome.  They had just the right amount of coconut flavor with just a hint of curry.  I also had the biscuits and gravy which was equally impressive.  Heck even the coffee was good.  The only criticism I would have is for the price I think they could increase the portion size on the waffles.  Well...I do have one more complaint and that is that I discovered this gem only 10 days before I move out of state!"}
{"text":"Never been to a vegan dinner but Im always looking to try new things. There reviews are great and its a small neighborhood type place and always busy. Took my wife there she wasnt a big fan but she isn't as open minded as I am lol overall to me it really wasnt bad, were not vegans but for the experience I would say there pancakes were quite good and flavorful I couldnt do the eggplant bacon which I was excited to try"}
{"text":"Well time to say goodbye to Bragg's Factory Diner......they are officially closing this location tomorrow (10-4-15). However when we went this morning for breakfast I had a feeling that today will be there last day because they were running out of everything (10-3-15). The pancakes and hashbrowns were far and away there best items and today was no exception. I have heard all kinds of rumors as to why they are closing and since I don't have any facts I won't speculate. However with that being said it is truly sad that this establishment is closing since there are so few GOOD VEGAN options here in the Valley. Bragg's Factory Diner will indeed be missed by me.....I can't speak for anyone else......so I wish the owners and staff must success in there next endeavors. One other note they have opened a location called the Coronado which I will review at a later date but it has both Vegetarian and Vegan options. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying that I am not a vegetarian or vegan! Having said that, I would like to share that this place was really delicious!! I enjoyed my breakfast and I would have given them five stars if it wasn't for the long piece of hair that I found on my food! The waitress made sure that they redid the order in a timely manner!! I recommend it!"}
{"text":"The best pancakes! Everything is delicious here. I'm ready to burst from this deliciousness. Don't think twice about going anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch during off peak time, party of five.  We had to wait quite a while to get acknowledged with a \"be with you in a sec\" and it's a tiny place.  Good looking menu, everything sounded delicious. We ordered and one person in our party is allergic to one ingredient on every menu item so she asks to substitute because of her food allergies and they said they couldn't change any of the meals in anyway.   By this point we had been there for a long while and it wasn't practical to leave so she opted not to eat and we'd grab her something once we left. So sad she had to watch us eat when the food came.  Everyone loved their meal the food was delicious but we waited so long for everything. Service is the pits."}
{"text":"This place is so sweetly-hipster cool and the folks who served us were downright delightful, helpful, and attentive. They offered drinks right away so I was able to enjoy my freshly squeezed lemonade whilst I scanned the menu. Which was great; lots of playful and wonderful sounding offers, it was hard to choose. The big breakfast plate because I couldn't decided; it had biscuits and gravy (fair-good), eggplant \"bacon\" (fair-needs work, IMHO), hash browns (good-great), and pan cakes (great)! As I was leaving, they were replacing the bottled ketchup on the tables with home made. For you local vegan/vegetarian peeps, patronize this joint - let this delicious eatery thrive and flourish! My next trip to Phoenix will surely include a stop here!"}
{"text":"Had a free morning and decided to finally stop into Bragg's Factory Diner. The weather was so nice I we almost sat out side to eat. But decided on dining inside. This is a cute and cozy spot, each coffee cup is different and each table has cute and quirky salt and pepper shakers. My husband got the Frank Lloyd Bite and I got the Koo-Koo Bananas Pancakes with a side of Jackfruit Barbacoa both meals were delicious! The Jackfruit Barbacoa was very well seasoned and the pancakes were so light and fluffy. My husband is not a plant based eater but he joined me he enjoyed his food also. I can't wait to go back for lunch and try one of the sandwiches they offer. They also have tempting baked goods offered up daily and of course I ended up taking a coconut cookie and a chocolate peanut butter brownie to go."}
{"text":"YES! love it, everything about it, can't get enough. First, let me just say I love the location, and the potential for the area, gets me very excited that things are starting to really happen here. Okay so my family and I have been trying to get here for a while, but we are new parents, and our lives are chaotic at the moment. FINALLY made it this past Saturday, and we couldn't have been more pleased. Great service, fantastic food, our daughter had a great time as well, as Braggs and their staff are very kid friendly and capatible. I had the scrambler, and eggplant bacon (like NOTHING I have had before!) Great coffee, we took some pie home, and can't wait to come back and try some more. My wife isn't vegetarian and was more than happy with the menu, I am and of course love the idea of ordering anything that looks good and knowing that it will be prepared to my diet. Can't lose, planning next weekend around making our way back! Thanks Braggs and the wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"I am not really sure what other reviewers have been smoking, but this place is truly awful. I had the kale salad and it was inedible. My wife had an egg concoction that was supposed to be scrambled and it really wasn't. Besides which, it came out cold. The green tea was exceptionally bitter. Sorry, I found no redeeming qualities to this place what so ever."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me this long to review this place!  Bragg's has literally all the things I look for/love in a restaurant, so for me it's one of the best spots in Phoenix. This pie factory-cum-diner now boasts an all-vegan menu laden with hearty comfort foods. Vegan comfort foods, you ask? How can this be, you ask?  You're covered here whether you like sweet or savory noms. They've got banana pancakes with walnuts, nachos, egg-like things that are very egg like, and sandwiches that stand proud and say \"I am not meat. I am delicious.\" The great thing is they're not \"good vegan food.\" It's just good food that happens to be vegan.  My personal favorite is the Nopales Like Home because of my favorite thing they make at Braggs: jackfruit barbacoa. Jackfruit is the fruit of a plant that when cooked under low heat with marinade soaks up its flavor and can be shredded, taking on a very pork-y texture. I get this every time, and every once in a while I'll see one of the massive salads and get a little jealous, which is how I know it's time for an extra side of jackfruit.  A favorite-non-food thing about this place for me is the diverse collection of mugs and the way-more-diverse and impressive collection of salt and pepper shakers.   tl;dr There's coffee. There's pie. There's delicious comfort food. It's a cozy establishment with great food and lots of personality."}
{"text":"If you had mentioned to me a few years ago that a group of friends were having brunch at a Vegan restaurant I would have found a reason to be busy that day.  One thing the friends I have made directly and indirectly through Yelp is I have yet to meet all the foods I like.  I chose a chickpea burger and it was good as was the cole slaw I had with it.  In our party of 10 we tried almost everything on the menu and every plate was clean at the end.  I think the only thing that fell short was the eggplant \"bacon\".  This restaurant only seats a few over 20 and our party of 10 was a bit rough for them to get the food out all at once but we were not in a hurry and they were very friendly.  They are also a bakery with pies and donuts and such. I would go back again."}
{"text":"I'm an out of town visitor who was looking forward to visiting all the veg places in the Phoenix area during my visit! We made it to Bragg's Sunday afternoon and immediately had a table! My son ordered the special which was a peanut butter waffle topped with bananas and chocolate chips, along with a side of hash browns. He enjoyed his meal and said he'd order it again! I ordered the Frank Lloyd Wright (apologies if I got that name a little wrong)! I was super excited to try their eggplant bacon; really, it was the only thing I was looking forward to trying! I've made it at home and it's delicious, but too time consuming for the amount of time I have for meal prep. Well, turns out the best part of my order was the pancakes! Seriously, I'll crave these things for life (this is coming from someone who isn't a pancake person)! They were light and had great flavor. I judge everything in it's \"natural\" state, so no syrup on these bad boys. Man, they were so good! The eggplant bacon...for lack of a better word, boooooooo! Such a disappointment! They were not dry/crisp. I didn't even want to eat it, but I did. The hashbrowns were the typical diner shredded potato style. The seasoning of them was good, but that style of hashbrown absorbs too much oil for my liking. The biscuit and gravy...can I get another booooooooo?!?!? Biscuit was hard and dry and the flavor of the gravy was not too hot, neither was the temperature.  We decided to grab a treat to go, one slice of blackberry peach pie, and one raspberry brownie. The pie was disappointing as the peaches were hard and I think they used lime or something in the fruit, so it tasted like some sort of household cleaner. The crust was good though. As for the brownie, it's probably awesome fresh. Also, the raspberry portion of the brownie was weird. I think it would have been better if the raspberries were puréed and mixed in, or on top. Biting into whole raspberries hidden within the brownie didn't work for me.  All that being said, I'd of course go back for the pancakes any day! I also want to try some of their other items. Hopefully the other items I try will improve the rating I gave them!"}
{"text":"This spot is so adorable. I've lived downtown for a couple years now and have never even heard of this place but glad I stopped in.   Great vegan food. Best pancakes. The curry waffles are yummy and a must try.   And they have cold brew! Bless their hearts.   A Phoenix hidden treasure."}
{"text":"two stars for being so vegan. negative three stars for bad food.   this \"EBT\" eggplant sandwich people are talking about came with an abundance of wet, undercooked, hard to chew, poorly spiced eggplant. basically had to dump out all the eggplant and just eat a tomato sandwich. ugh.  the biscuits and gravy were better, but still under spiced and not served hot. gravy is too important in this world to be served cold.   hash browns were so small and stringy that they didn't really have a bite, just grease and an excuse to eat ketchup... and these were the best part of our meal.  wanted pie, but naw. not this time. don't know if i'll ever be back though.   sucks, cuz i really wanted to love this place."}
{"text":"I've been hoping this space on the corner of Grand Ave and 13th Ave would be filled with something different, unique and cute: Bragg's Factory Diner is just that. The coffee is way better than your average diner. My family and I sampled almost everything from the breakfast menu and everything we sampled was delicious. The waffles were crispy but fluffy, the pancakes were perfect with goat cheese and strawberries, the biscuit was seriously amazing and probably my favorite item!!! The gravy had delicious jalapenos and corn and was better than any sausage gravy I've ever had. The service was friendly and welcoming, they let us enjoy our meal and conversation but were attentive and gave great suggestions based on what we were hungry for. I'm not a vegan or veg but I think about this menu all the time and cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"I really don't like Phoenix. The entire city feels like it has no soul. Like Orange County without the beach.   However Bragg's is one of the most redemptive things that Phoenix has in my mind. Great menu. Nice staff. Tasty food. Vegan donuts. Also, I really enjoyed the street that its on. Green bike lanes, street art. Not a single mall in sight."}
{"text":"Coconut curry waffles. An \"E.L.T.\" with eggplant bacon. Rosemary apple pie. Rosemary potatoes. I'm saluting and salivating at the memory of them. The food here is damn good (\"leftovers\"? Not around here), and I love the pie-shaped layout of the small dining area. The only reason I can't give BFD five stars is because the location -- on an adaptive-reuse, industrialized stretch of Grand Avenue -- won't appeal to everyone, and frankly might intimidate others. The flavor of the surrounding artistic community beats the blight, in my opinion, but this definitely isn't the place for diners who like valet parking and pristine serviettes. But for people who want delicious food (it's all vegetarian/vegan, but I'm also a carnivore, and I have no complaints with this plate-licking-good fare) at reasonable prices in a comfortable, friendly atmosphere, BFD hits the spot."}
{"text":"Great breakfast don't leave without a chocolate chip cookie."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian and living close by, I have been dying to try this place since it opened.  We finally got there yesterday morning for breakfast.  Man, this joint is odd.  It's in kind of a light industrial area, and the dining area is a triangular room with about 12 tables.  It is decorated with some pretty odd stuff as well.  The menu is small with just about 8 breakfast and a similar amount of lunch selections.  They all looked delicious, but we'd heard about the coconut curry waffles, which is what my husband ordered with a side of biscuits and gravy.  I got the breakfast burrito with eggs, peppers, onions, and Soyrizo.  Everything we had was really tasty.  The waffle was unique.  I could have eated it with no syrup, and he agreed.  My personal favorite was the biscuit which seemed homemade with chunks of corn in it, and a slightly spicy gravy.  I don't even think I've had biscuits and gravy after being a vegetarian for over 20 years, but I can say, it was delightful.  The service was great, super friendly and quick.  We'll be coming back for more for sure!"}
{"text":"Ok...non vegetarians unite...with fork in hand...try the food but stay and repeat visit for the Pie!  OMG. The crust... service was sweet too!"}
{"text":"Bragg's is an adorable little restaurant in Encanto serving up unique vegan cuisine. I got their veggie burger, which was good, but it was their strawberry jalapeno pie that was peculiar and phenomenal. The owners were quite nice and the atmosphere is quaint and rather endearing."}
{"text":"i was  anxiously awaiting the opening of this restaurant- i'm not a vegan or a vegetarian, though i do tend to eat that way, but i enjoy good food and i really enjoy good diner food. we went there at around 1pm on a saturday- they are open from 7am-2pm and it was still relatively busy. we were seated right away- the decor is fun and kitschy. the service was very good- all of our questions were answered and our server made us feel very comfortable. i ordered the reuben- the marble rye was amazing! the slaw for the sandwich was both sweet and sour and i definitely couldn't tell the swiss cheese was vegan. my friend ordered the coo-coo (?') banana pancakes- he couldn't stop raving about them and was very pleased that the side of fruit salad he ordered actually contained different kinds of fruit. i'm only sad that i didn't order the eggplant bacon- my boyfriend is now obsessed with it! i can't wait to go back to try it  and a piece of their homemade pie!"}
{"text":"My pancakes were heaven and I'm now in a relationship with eggplant bacon."}
{"text":"Bragg's Pie Factory is a pretty amazing place.  Right in the heat of Grand Ave's eclectic art scene this former confection creation station is now a very cool, very open and airy art space.  I rented the space for a modest sum to throw a party there for the Phoenix Fringe Festival's closing night and it couldn't have gone better.  There is currently a mutant pinata show going on (stop by, you can see it from the street!) and that made for a really fun vibe for the party.  The owner, Beatrice (go visit her at Kooky Krafts up the street) was very accommodating and positive about the whole experience.  Beatrice is an energy all her own on Grand Ave., really working to reuse and rehab the marvelous old buildings from Phoenix's former main-drag.   The building itself is a giant open front room with other, similarly large back rooms which house local businesses.  The front room, the one we rented, is about a football field in size, stark white with polished concrete floors.  It feels big when you're in it, but we were able to use some select lighting (Xmas lights are your friend) to make the space somewhat intimate.  Rock on Pie Factory, rock on."}
{"text":"What a great place to get excellent vegan food! They even have gluten free waffles! I love the sandwiches, but I've also had the burritos & salads and they are wonderful too. I always get the nachos to start & whatever yummy dessert they offer that day to end-I leave there stuffed every time because everything tastes so good!"}
{"text":"Delish! I had the eggs with spinach, pesto, and tomatoes with a side of eggplant \"bacon\"...sounds a bit odd but try it, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"The menu is somewhat small, but considering it is a vegan restaurant, I understand completely.  I had the almond pancakes with strawberries, sans goat cheese (I'm not a crazy big fan of goat cheese) and a side of fruit. The pancakes were moist and heavy, which is actually how I enjoy my pancakes, as opposed to the fluffy but dry ones you find at IHOP and Denny's. Bragg's offers real maple syrup (as in, it comes from maple trees, not from Mrs. Butterworth's kitchen) to go with their pancakes, which happily surprised me. The side of fruit was more delicious than you would expect--they use seasonal fruits instead of cheap fruits, so my side of fruit included green grapes, oranges and blueberries, all ripened to perfection.  I also got a bite of my friend's pie. I'm pretty sure it was peach berry. I'm definitely ordering my own slice next time!  Cons: Small space."}
{"text":"Love this place, I always get the Frank Lloyd Bite, which is a nice breakfast combo.  Their vegan desserts are so good, love the sweet and savory mix of their berry pies with rosemary crumble.  My only complaint is that they are not closer to our house!"}
{"text":"Best. Pie. Ever.  Love their vegan nacho cheese. The southwest/vegan take on biscuits and gravy was too sweet for my tastes.  I appreciate the concept of this business and want to support them. However, it seems like about half of the menu items I've tried just aren't what my taste buds are looking for. I'll keep going back and trying new things though. They can be quite packed around weekend brunch time and they are a small establishment."}
{"text":"So incredibly good!!! All of the food is made with a shit ton of love, and maybe crack.. Because I'm addicted."}
{"text":"Vegan, it was a new experience for me to order a vegan breakfast and I enjoyed it. The space and location is good.  I would love to have the building for my business. If you want to try something new, vegan, give it a go."}
{"text":"Cute little homey restaurant with friendly service. The hash browns are well seasoned and nice and crispy. The banana pancakes are light and yummy. The toast is multigrain and came with an apricot jam that was tasty. Good breakfast that does not leave you feeling weighed down. Full dining room when we went packed with down to earth seeming people."}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast with our 3 year old. The children menu was good, good sized too! we ordered the silver dollar pancake with hash browns, they were really good. I ordered the curry waffles with rosemary potatoes. The waffles were great! the potatoes were dry, but maple syrup saved the day. My husband ordered the Frank Lloyd bite. We didn't really care for the eggplant bacon, it was really just baked eggplant without much flavor. The mushroom gravy biscuit was not to our taste. But the pancake and hash-Browns were great. The eating area is small and very hipster. The servers were good.  We will go back soon to try lunch..."}
{"text":"I never considered being vegetarian or vegan for that matter, but after trying the food here at braggs, I could see it being a possibility. I orders the \"nopales\" which is equivalent to a pull pork sandwhich, except this was all vegetarian made with jack fruit. It had the texture and the taste of pulled pork, I couldn't even tell. And for a dessert we had the strawberry peach pie. Who doesn't like pie. I would definitely comeback and recommend this to others. Oh btw the staff was friendly and very helpful. They were attentive in making sure we were comfortable and satisfied with everything."}
{"text":"So creative and delicious jackfruit. I cannot have enough of it. The spinach and tomatoes are so fresh."}
{"text":"Still a Fan! But call before you go on a weekend (especially if you live far away!). We went a couple of weeks ago and the sign said \"Open\" so we parked and walked up to the door, but they were closed for a special event - there were happy faces inside...eating...our...breakfast. We went to Green...happy ending."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Went there for dinner with my brother. He is allergic to all dairy so it's not easy finding restaurants where we can order anything and not worry about having a reaction. We ordered the ELT, an eggplant-bacon sandwich, and the Nacho-Man Randy Savage which was a giant plate of nacho cheesy goodness. For being all vegan, the flavored and textures were of the real thing- best nacho cheese I've ever had. Service was great. We have a lovely waitress that was super friendly. We ordered dessert at the order of a couple other people eating in the restaurant and we were not sorry! The green tea/lingonberry cheesecake was out of this world. Also the ginger cookies were perfect. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Their food is so damn good.  Whether you're vegan or not, lovers of greasy spoon diner fare will be impressed with any dish at Bragg's. Their food will move you, especially if you've missed these flavors after switching to a plant-based diet.  In front of me was the \"'Ello Gubnuh,\" a tofu scramble with the distinctive skillet-side browning and texture I recall of scrambled eggs from my pre-vegan days. With it came the house's light-but-perfectly-seasoned vegan sausage. My wife ordered the \"Flax Stax,\" pancakes that handily beat dairy and egg equivalents. While light and fluffy, Bragg's managed to capture that subtle doughy quality found in other diner's pancakes and often missing from vegan-friendly recipes.  You'll also find here an incredibly friendly and attentive staff. They offered service with a smile, and kept our coffee mugs happily topped off during our visit. Around you at Bragg's is an environment with a sincere kind of nostalgia, inviting compared to saccharine retro-chic, dashed with playful kitsch and colorful, decades-old tableware that'll put a grin on your face.  Bragg's is a memorable restaurant that shines among vegan-friendly establishments. If you can eat at only one restaurant in Phoenix, you should make it this one!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place for a while because it's just so darn cute from the outside! I was a little disappointed. The good: service, prices, decor. The food left me thinking, \"glad I tried it, but meh.\" They have plates with cheese and optional eggs which is nice for non vegans. I ordered a lemonade to drink and when I tried it, my friend asked me what it tasted like. I replied \"ass\". Haha. It was true. I had plain water instead. The pancakes were good, my avocado sandwich was good, the barbacoa was okay, the eggplant bacon was okay, and the hasbrowns weren't good. The food took a little long to come out. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"went to a trivia night event here saturday, and while i am not vegan or veg i eat that way frequently and have no problems with places not serving meat. great serveice, great prices, the dishes that our table had were all fantastic...they even had vegan doughnuts that were replicas of the cartoon version straight off of the simpsons. quirky place thats like nothing else in downtown"}
{"text":"On my last morning in Phoenix, we hopped on some bikes and pedaled over to Bragg's, which is conveniently located on a street with good bike lanes. They have bike parking right outside, which also made it easy for me to keep an eye on our bikes.  The place is tiny, but larger than I expected based on reading other reviews which led me to believe they could only seat 15 people. There were seats for at least 20 people inside, and they had a couple of small tables outside, as well. Even at prime brunch time on a Sunday, the place was not crowded, and we were seated right away.  I really loved the feel of Bragg's. Everything was cute shabby chic, with mismatched cups and plates, and each table has its own kitschy set of salt & pepper shakers. Our server had a cute apron and helped us figure out what I could eat.   Although they have several vegan options and several gluten-free options, they do not necessarily overlap. The tofu scramble is vegan but not gluten-free, which was very disappointing (especially since you'd think a place called Bragg's would be happy to use Bragg's Liquid Aminos instead of soy sauce), and the gravy for the biscuits is vegan and gluten-free, but the biscuits are not. So the only vegan and gluten-free option was hash browns with gravy on top. Fortunately, it was very tasty. They also had a slice of a vegan, gluten-free tart left over from the previous day, so I bought it and took it with me. It was not as tasty as those hash browns with the gravy. They seem to have different baked goods every day, so there should be other vegan, gluten-free options available...just not on Sunday."}
{"text":"I LOVE when I have time to come into the city & eat at Braggs. The food is always amazing, the people are kind & incredible hosts. We always feel pleasantly full & satisfied when we are leave & it's always worth the trip. Great selection of vegan dishes that are unique, but still pretty traditional. Overall, this place is just great!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place.  I'm no where near being called vegan or vegetarian, by any means, but the food here is fantastic.  Had The Classic and added goat cheese on one occasion, and the Avocado Sando on another.  You don't leave here still hungry, like some health food restaurants; their portion sizes are more than fair for the price.  That being said, don't forget to leave room for pie!"}
{"text":"Bragg's gave me my first vegetarian/vegan \"diner\" experience. I love the shape of the place (corner-style) and the street art views. The building used to be Bragg's Pie Factory and awesomely, they still serve pies. There isn't a large dining area so the roar is very low... buuuut you can hear everyone's conversation. It wasn't bothersome to me though and no one else seemed to mind. Now about the chow... I ordered the special of the day---huevos rancheros (veganized using tofu instead of eggs) and eggplant \"bacon\" on the side. It was delicious and I definitely plan to return for those veganized biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"I got the beet burger and it was really good wayyy better than green. You can tell they make everything from scratch. The jackfruit side with the sandwich taste like short ribs the texture and flavor were spot on. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"The nachos with jackfruit were amazing and the servers were really attentive.  Will definitely be going back to Braggs!"}
{"text":"I live for the Avocado Sando. The \"grilled veggies\" side are literally the best thing you will ever put in your mouth (don't tell my husband ;) Desserts are amazing, especially the salted chocolate pecan pie. Anything they make with peanut butter is also SO GOOD. Also, get the lemonade!"}
{"text":"I'm very thankful that Bragg's has finally opened their doors!  We've been waiting with baited breathe since we heard there was a new vegetarian joint coming to town.  I had the E.L.T. and I'm happy to report that it was delicious!  I'm not a big fan of eggplant (shhh don't tell the vegetarian police) but my dining companion, who was at a sneak peek event, said that the eggplant was not mushy and quite good.  I'm glad I followed her advice.  My side was the potato salad which was vegan as well and had some yummy \"bacon\" bits on top.  I really liked the added flavor that it gave.  I can't wait to come back, I must try all the things!!  AND YES THERE'S PIE!!!!!"}
{"text":"So glad I finally got to visit Bragg's - it's close to work AND it's delicious. Such a fan, and I will be back!  Went with a bunch of coworkers, all omnivores (I'm the only veg), and we all (mostly) ordered something different. A rundown:  2 Chickpea burgers with rosemary potatoes: verdict? Delicious! The burger wasn't too dry OR too mushy, which is a real compliment. So many times I've had places try to make their burgers moist, which usually results in a mushy, unappetizing pile. Not Bragg's! They know how to make a solid chickpea burger.  Also, chickpea burger?! So clever, and so much better than the standard black bean burgers I'm used to ordering. Score!  I only wish I had more rosemary potatoes, but that's just me being greedy. They were SO good - on the crunchy side, but I like crunchy potatoes!  One person ordered the ELT (eggplant, lettuce and tomato), and she really liked it. We all tried a side of the eggplant bacon. Now, I don't like eggplant. At all. But this was surprisingly good! It was decently crunchy, but the marinade made it. BBQ-tasting sauce FTW!  On to the good part: the desserts!  Cookies - fabulous. Order them all. Eat all the cookies!!!  Magic bar - all right. I thought it was good, but my bf thought it was a little dry.   Peanut Butter Pie - OMG I'm so glad I only tried a bite, because it was TOO good. Eat all the Peanut Butter Pies good. Get it!  Fruit pies - we ordered two, and I can't for the life of me remember what they were. Not a fruit person (yeah, I know, it's weird). However, the fruit pies were really good! Fresh, fruity, good crust.  Pecan pie - now, I didn't try this one, but I gave it to my parents to try. They said it was too gritty... :-/ I didn't even tell them it was vegan, so I have to assume they're right.  Stick to the fruit and peanut butter pie if you don't want an unhappy surprise. Those I can guarantee!  My total, for a chickpea burger + drink + 1 cookie + magic bar + pecan pie + tip came to $25. Not bad considering how much food I consumed/shared/brought home.   Also, service here is a bit slow but very friendly. Go with a little bit of time to spare, but not a whole lot. Try to go early if you're going at lunch because it gets crowded and there's not a lot of space.  4 stars because I have to go back and give that pecan pie a second chance ;)"}
{"text":"I walked in this place and first thing I thought was, this is one of those places that should go in the famous Weird Arizona book, it is pure kitsch! Originally Bragg's was an actually pie factory, established in 1947, and one of the pictures on the wall, and they use the family photo approach with a multitude of family and weird Arizona specific images, is obviously of one of the original owners of Bragg's with his two daughters leaning on a Bragg's pie factory delivery trucks.   The table in the place appear to be reclaimed wood, varnished over and every table has a unique, and kitschy, set of salt and pepper shakers. Beyond that, high ceilings and windows that let in a good amount of natural light an in the corner, one of those old fashioned display cases where the baker part of the baking and chef owner team, puts a variety of what I assume are pretty much all vegan deserts but someone will need to confirm.  As for the food, ah the food! I had a friend visiting who prefers vegan food choices and this place was perfect for breakfast! You can get local eggs but there is always the tofu scramble option and instead of tempah bacon, they have eggplant bacon, which is pretty good. I had the Frank Lloyd Bite option, which has the most amazing pancakes, I can't wait to go eat them again and the hash browns, my gosh, the hash browns, so good! I also had a side of rosemary roasted potatoes since the biscuits and I assume vegan gravy, were not ready but they were great!  Oh, and for some reason, vegan breakfast places always have the most amazing coffee, and this place was no exception. They buy the beans from a small local roaster and the flavor is unbelievable. It is worth going to this place for the coffee alone!  Suffice to say, I have feeling deeply and madly in foodie love with this quaint little bit of weird Arizona with lovely, lovely vegan food options. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"love this place, have gone back quite a few times. the people are so nice and the food is amazing.  if your looking for a quick and health conscious meal, this place will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Finding good, reasonably priced vegan food in Phoenix just got easier for me!  Don't let the funky grand avenue address put you off; it's easy to find and there's ample parking.  Go for the food! It's terrific. I had the \"nopales like home\"; it's made with grilled no pales (cactus) and barbequed jackfruit (a starchy fruit with a meat like texture). My beloved had the ELT. I was happier than he -- the sandwich was spicy and filling. He would have liked the eggplant in his sandwich to be a bit more crispy, but he enjoyed it, nevertheless.  We even tried their pies. We had the peach/almond. It was a sweet end to a nice meal.  I am very glad to have tried this place. We'll be back."}
{"text":"we have eaten there a few time and haven't really been disappointed...we have done breakfast mostly and it is always tasty...great location...LOTS of parking...and great atmosphere. Area is trying to make a comeback but still has some boarded up buildings around it."}
{"text":"This place is a tiny adorable cafe connected to the Bragg's Pie Factory building in the Roosevelt/Grand arts district. A little sticky because of the evap cooler, but very comfortable on this 100+ degree day. Service was prompt and our server was very friendly and helpful.   As for the food...I LOVE that 95% of the menu is vegan. Awesome! My wife wanted to give a 5 star rating just for the pancakes. She had the Frank Lloyd Bite, which includes 2 almond pancakes, eggplant 'bacon', hash browns, and a biscuit with poblano/corn gravy. I already mentioned the pancakes. Fabulosity. The hash browns were fresh and perfectly crispy and not at all greasy. The housewife catsup was yum but unnecessary. The eggplant bacon was interesting - nothing about it reminds me of bacon, but I liked it anyway and it was a great compliment to the rest of the plate. The biscuit had great texture and served only as a vehicle for the gravy. The gravy was a lovely sauce, but a little bland, and could have used a little more poblano or punch.   I had the Early Birdrito which came with a side, so I chose Jackfruit Barbacoa. The Birdrito comes scrambled with eggs or tofu, quinoa/hempseed chorizo, caramelized onions and peppers. Slightly bland with all the egg, but I added the Barbacoa and shazaam!!! The jackfruit is very convincing as pork or beef, and it was just the perfect balance of spicy and savory.  We saved a bit of room because the dessert menu is all vegan. How many places in town offer anything vegan for dessert? Maybe 3. Braggs had 12 different baked goods to choose from. We had the peach/basil pie, a choco/coconut bar, and a choco/espresso bar. Each was full of interesting flavor and had great texture.   The bill was $30 and we'll DEFINITELY be back."}
{"text":"This is my goto place when I want a raw / vegan meal for lunch.  It's in a great spot on Grand Ave and has tons of natural lighting.  The staff is friendly and as awesome as they come.    The veggie meals are simple and priced just right.  A big plus is that they offer  vegan options without tofu.  I'm not a fan of soy!  And if you like treats, you won't be underwhelmed.  Assortments of goodies such as pie, cookies, cake, scones are always encased in the glass display conspicuously placed in the eating area.  Purposely I'm sure so you won't leave before ordering one."}
{"text":"Driving up you can't miss the retro storefront with random objects hanging from the knitted trees.  A large parking lot providing free parking is located adjacent to their location surrounded by brightly colored walls covered in Dr. Seuss artwork.  From the old time family photos on the wall to the random kitsch salt and peppers shakers, and the corner glass pastry case, walking into their establishment I felt as though I was stepping back in time.  I couldn't help but think how it would feel to live in Phoenix 15-20 years ago.  While there aren't a ton of tables in the diner we were successful in finding ourselves a seat and sat ourselves.  Most of their food isn't typical fare since they don't try to replicate burgers and such.  Instead they take their own twist on things.  However, they're 'twists' aren't so off the wall that a person looking for something 'normal' won't find anything.  Within a few moments our waitress was at our table taking our order. 'Koo Koo Banana Pancake's for me and vegan 'Bwiscuits and Gwavy' for my husband.  We took our time enjoying the photos on the wall as we waited for our food.  We also took a gander at the glass case full of cookies and pies.  Our service was speedy and it took little time for our dishes to arrive.  I love pancakes.  Add in some sugar & rum caramelized bananas and I was experiencing a little slice of heaven.  Sadly my husband didn't have the same experience as he found his dish to be pretty bland.   I made sure to grab a few bites and honestly thought it was pretty darn good.  So, while he didn't care for his entree we both chalked it up to his personal tastes."}
{"text":"The pancakes were amazing! Aside from that, we didn't particularly care for the eggplant bacon or the nachos... the cheeze still had bits of carrots in it. The staff was nice and so was their selection of deserts.  I would say it's a \"meh\". Would be willing to go again but definitely wouldn't be my first choice. However, as it is 100% vegan.. it gets 4 stars for going the extra mile and not just staying vegetarian. So, thank you for that!!"}
{"text":"OMFG. This place is AMAZING for vegans and meat-lovers! I love their banana bread waffles (GLUTEN FREE!) hash browns (different kind- compared to common hash browns--amazing texture in your mouth), and the eggplant bacon are to die for!!!!!!  Sunday brunches are awesome. This place reminds me of Portland. Cool chill waiters. Small cute breakfast joint. You'll be happily full and healthy!"}
{"text":"Ok...I really cannot express how great this place was. My wife and I woke up this morning and wanted to go to breakfast, someplace down town. I am a vegetarian and my wife tries to eat \"real food\" and enjoys some great veg food with me. This place fits the bill for great veggie food and it is 100% real food, no fake meats here. It was awesome.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Perfect, vegan/vegetarian prayers answered. I have been here 3 times now and the food has been on point. Good prices and great portions, friendly customer service and they even remembered me. Their breakfast burrito with the tofu scramble is by far the best breakfast burrito I have ever had, place is very charming and makes you feel like you are at a friends house for breakfast. I'm picky and I can not think of one flaw to this place. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since I have watched them on facebook with all their delicious looking desserts but that is all I can say was worth it. I tried the blueberry pie and it was very good. Now for my experience, we waited 45 minutes for our food in am empty restaurant which consisted of pancakes the circumference of my coffee cup and some eggs for 10 dollars. We really liked the biscuits and gravy and also the rosemary potatoes were good but the quantity of food was not at all worth it for the price. I was told that it is inconsistent so perhaps we went on a bad day but we will not come back with all the yummy breakfast places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"While on a vacation in Arizona, I asked around for vegan restaurant recommendations.  Bragg's was mentioned as a thumbs up.  This place really reminded me of Portland and the different quirky vegan restaurants.  We went there for breakfast, but were told that the lunch items were available as well.  I got the Bwiscuits and Gwavy, home made biscuits smothered in poblano gravy. my companion got the Nopales like Home, jackfruit barbacoa topped with grilled nopales.  Both meals came with sides, I got the potato salad and my companion got hash browns.  I really liked my biscuits and gravy, but one taste of the Nopales Like Home, and I knew that's what I should have ordered instead! This place offers friendly service and vegan home cooked meals...it's really a gem tucked in a quirky triangle!"}
{"text":"There are so few places in Phoenix that have good vegan food, and this place is one of them. We love the Bratt burger, and rosemary potatoes and every kind of sweet you can imagine. Specifically the \"magic bar\"! Oh, and you can't forget the pecan cinnamon roll pie.  They have a real apple pie, not as good as mine though, but good..."}
{"text":"This place is incredibly small, they only have enough seating for about 14 to 16 people, if even that. Was not able to grab a seat for two people, hopefully when an establishment advertises they have adequate seating to meet demand or at least look into expanding to a bigger place."}
{"text":"Whoa, the Gluten-Free Your Mind Waffle was quite amazing. Not just for being a vegan and gluten-free waffle, but for ANY waffle, period! It was lightly sweet as it was a banana bread/walnut/chocolate chip waffle batter, fluffy on the inside and a bit crisp on the outside, dusted with cinnamon and sugar on top. Did not need any syrup at all! I also got the Rosemary Potatoes as the side, and while they were fairly good (despite being slightly undercooked), I opted to leave most of it and opted for polishing off the waffle. Best decision ever.  The coffee was fairly decent, too, and my server refilled my cup even though I was getting ready to get up to pay and leave. So I appreciated that."}
{"text":"We totally lucked out finding a vegan diner just minutes from our hotel in Phoenix.  It was a $4 uber ride up Grand Ave. to this little gem and after eating there on our last day in town, both me and the BF thought we should have made it a point to get here every day!   The things I crave since giving up meat and dairy (most of the time)--a good biscuit with a yummy, flavorful gravy, a reuben, BBQ of any kind, and pie with a good flaky crust--were all right there on their menu and in their bakery case, taunting me.  We ordered the Frank Lloyd Bite, the Nopales like Home and a slice of the cherry pie.  All of it was super yummy and we had clean plates in minutes.  The service was attentive and friendly and we liked learning a little about the area and the Bragg name, too.    For vegans and vegs, this place is great. But, even if you're a carnivore, there are so many tasty options, I'm sure everyone can find something that suits their tastebuds!"}
{"text":"I was SO tickled to find this place on Happy Cow!  Mr. Cake and I made a stop here on the way up to Sedona, and I don't  regret it one bit.    For one, the place is absolutely adorable aesthetically.  Uniquely situated in the corner of a building, it has a kitchy, intimate feel.  The service was impeccable.  It was a cold Wednesday night so they weren't terribly busy, so we got a lot of attention without them being overbearing.  We even were told history about the building and family, and were humorously corrected about our erroneous assumption that being a veg restaurant, they were somehow intertwined with Bragg's Liquid Aminos, a vegan seasoning with a cult following.  Now, for the food.  I had the fresh squeezed lemonade which was the perfect blend of tart and sweet, and they even gave me a refill to go at the end, which was great for the ride ahead.  Mr. Cake got the \"How Funky is Your Chickpea\" burger and loved it, only remarking that he wished he had a more plentiful serving of the rosemary potato side, which he really dug.  I had the \"Bwiscuits & Gwavy\" (hilarious to say out loud - go ahead and try it, you sound like a drunk toddler) with a side of hashbrowns.  The biscuits themselves were large and perfect, but I was surprised with it arrived and the gravy wasn't at all what I expected.  It was more of a dark brown stew that had poblanos and a lot of white kernal corn in it.  It was not bad, but it wasn't what I wanted, which was the more traditional seasoned white gravy with what I hoped would be faux sausage in it.  If I was in the mood for what I got, I would have liked it, however, I was a little disappointed to not have to comfort food I was envisioning.  The hashbrown side was fantastic however, and was really cool in texture - the potatoes were shredded much more fine.  I was pleased as punch that they had Tapatio as their hot sauce, and doused my hashbrowns per the ushe.  Tapatio is clearly the most superior of hot sauces, with Cholula taking a close second.  Tabasco is an abomination and restaurants immediately lose points in my world if they have it.  The food made us very full, so we opted out of the slices of pie we planned on getting, and instead got a black and white cookie, which I've not had in ages as a vegan version is not available anywhere I've ever seen.  It was great, and wrapped up the meal well.  Clearly, they are known for their pie, and this was validated as about halfway through the meal, a solo customer walked in and ordered just a slice of pie and coffee.  They had vegan gluten-free pecan pie that looked amazing, and I was sad that I didn't have room for it.  I was just...absolutely charmed.  Go here."}
{"text":"I just wanted to give another 5 STARS for having a wonderful experience and wonderful customer service this past Wednesday. Thank you, Braggs!"}
{"text":"A group of us were in Phoenix to hike the Grand Canyon.  Prior to leaving for the GC we wanted to get a good breakfast.  Bragg's Factory Diner exceeded our expectations.  I had the early birdrito....so yummy.  We also split several of the baked goods...delicious.  This is a fun, funky place with lots to look at.  It's run by a great couple and wonderful baker.  Getting to know them made the experience that much better.  If I lived in Phoenix I would be a regular for sure."}
{"text":"Bragg's factory diner serves vegan foods and has really good ska music playing.  Every salt shaker is different. Every coffee mug is unique.   A really fun environment."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the BEST pancakes I have EVER eaten.  I will go back again and again until I have tried their entire menu, including all their pies."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie. I'm really digging this place. Very hipster like. Great atmosphere! This might be my new brunch place! whoooooooo.  I came here and got the citrus pancakes and fruits on the side. It was delicious. No syrup needed. It was delightful. :D   I shall be back!"}
{"text":"My lovely friend did some mosaics on Grand Avenue, so we toured the street to ooh and aah until the temperatures hit 114 degrees and these tourists were about to flat line on the streets, so we popped in here for lunch and to cool down. I love all things quirky, and this little place was full of quirky.  We got a round of Arnold Palmers to start with. The server was very patient with us, as 3 of us hadn't seen each other in 10 years and there was a lot of girly gabbing going on. I ended up with a sandwich that had avocados in it, lots and lots of avocados, and it was GUD.  Too bad we had no room for pie!"}
{"text":"Awesome little vegan diner! Everything on the menu is vegan except they do offer eggs.. I came here around 7pm and ordered the French toast.. Delicious!   Now this is why i only ranked them 3 stars.. My friend and I shared the nachos.. Between the 2 of us we could barley eat half of it because it was lacking soooo much... My suggestion.. Real pico de gallo and more beans preferably black beans.. I've been vegan for many years and have tried my fair share of vegan cheeses.. The nacho cheese they used wasn't good.. It made me sick to my stomach after I left.  I will be back next time I'm in the area to try out some of their vegan treats!"}
{"text":"The prophecy has been fulfilled. I have been waiting for Bragg's Pie Factory to contain pies for the last decade, at least. Not only does it now contain pie, but delicious pies, just like your (secretly vegan) grandma used to make.  Oh, and it's a diner with a stellar breakfast menu. Aside from the fact that the waitress knew absolutely nothing about anything on the menu or what anything was made of or what things tasted like (or maybe even where she was), Bragg's put on a jolly good show.  First up: the coconut curry waffle, made with coconut milk instead of buttermilk and spiced up with a little curry powder. 'Twas creative and tasty, but could've used a little coconut on top. Next up were the banana flax pancakes. They were deliciously soft and fluffy and gooey and sweet... that said, I'm not sure that more soft, gooey, sweet bananas on top were necessary. Adding pecans, flax granola, or streusel would remedy the repetitive textures. And be generally awesome.  We also tried the cornmeal biscuit with gravy and eggplant bacon. The texture of the eggplant was nowhere near bacon, but the flavor totally was. Smokey goodness: nailed it. I was most impressed by this combination in terms of flavors, uniqueness, and the rarity of finding such a typically non-vegan creation in a vegan establishment. For dessert: blueberry and blackberry pie with a sweet, crumby, soft crust. There were whole berries in the pie. There was no gelatin. There was pie in the pie factory... and all was well in the land of my stomach."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting Bragg's for over a year now.  I love their vegan pancakes, especially the almond pancakes, which are made with almond milk (they do not contain actual almonds), which makes them sweeter. (Vegans should order them without the goat cheese topping.)  Those banana pancakes aren't half-stepping either! I'm also a big fan of their biscuits and gravy. Large southern-style biscuits, topped with a savory, corn-filled gravy. So good!  What I do not like are their sides. The hashbrowns are really stringy and I can't taste any potato in them. It's weird. But my DD loves them, so maybe it's just me. I'm not a fan of the eggplant bacon, which lacks flavor. Maybe if they fried them to a crisp and added some seasoning?  Rosemary potatoes are decent, but bland as well. On my last visit, I tried the Jackfruit Barbacoa. It was ok, but the tabasco sauce (or whatever hot sauce they dosed it in) drowned out any real flavor, so all I tasted was heat. I love spicy thangs, but only when they're equally flavorful.  The potato salad is probably my favorite side item, but it contains peas, which I do not like, so... But hey, there's always fresh fruit. Can't go wrong with that!  This IS a pie factory, so can we talk about the desserts?!  YASSSSS!  Where to start? Cookies, pies, donuts, whoopie-pies, brownies, cakes, etc.  I've loved every thing I've ever tried in that dessert case!  They had vegan lemon bars the last time I went, and OMG - it was amazing! I need to ask about ordering a batch of those just on GP.   You can order affordable whole cakes and pies for the holidays, or just because!  It's a funky/hip little veg*n diner.  They do serve animal-eggs and cheeses, and the menu isn't marked vegan vs vegetarian, so if you have questions just ask. I'm 99% positive that I was told that ALL of the desserts are vegan though.    They had really cool activities like karaoke nights, game nights, and other events this past summer, and food specials were available during those times.  Prices are already reasonable, but you can also find Groupon deals quite frequently. They have a private parking lot across the street, so there's no stress in trying to find a parking spot. Open late."}
{"text":"What a cute little diner! I love Bragg's. I've been here twice now. Located in the artsier part of Phoenix, this place used to be strictly a pie factory. I can't speak for the baked goods as I have yet to try them, however the breakfast here is divine.  Order the \"Bwiscuits and Gwavy\"--I totally cannot bring myself to actually say it that way but do it! Not too many places serve veg friendly b & g! The take is unique--fresh homemade biscuits smothered in a creamy poblano gravy. Out of the three places off the top of my head in Phoenix that serve veg b & g, this rendition gives the others a run for their money!   Service is has been fantastic both times I've been here. The wait for the food varies, I've noticed. The first time it was pretty busy so we waited a while and this last time it was pretty quick. It's great to see that there is another awesome vegetarian choice in downtown  Phoenix!"}
{"text":"First the good - the waitress was very nice and the coffee was good.  This place is your typical vegetarian place.   We went there for breakfast. Not a strip of real bacon in the whole place. I had the bwiscuits and gwavy. The biscuits tasted like flour and water and the gravy had no flavor whatsoever. My wife had the pancakes with brown sugar and caramelized bananas. Although the bananas and sugar had flavor, the pancakes were as tasteless as a CBS sitcom. Next time I'll head over to Matt's Big Breakfast."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and each time it has been delicious... finally a five star worthy place near me. Anyway, I have been here for breakfast, dinner, and dessert and all has been wonderful. The best breakfast item by far is the koo koo bananas pancakes. The bananas are amazing and the cakes are also wonderful. The biscuits and gravy are good too, they don't try to make it taste like sausage, which I like, they let it taste like veggies. I also had the chickpea burger for dinner. It was good, especially with their bbq sauce. Also, the salad has an amazing raspberry dressing...yum. They also have amazing pies and tarts.... they had a chocolate almond tart that was so freakin good... and vegan....and gluten free....what? Is that possible??? Awesome! Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"During week six of my eight week work travel extravaganza, I decided I was in desperate need of vegetables. Luckily, my boss was on board, which is where Bragg's comes in.  This place is so cute. The menu is small, but covers all its bases depending on your tastes. I ended up with a veggie omelet and fruit. It all tasted incredibly fresh and healthy - but in a good way.   Post-meal, I felt like all the business dinners and happy hours were a thing of the past. The dessert case was calling my name, but I turned a blind eye (which I might regret now).   Loved this place. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Braggs about a dozen times, have always been greeted with an enthusiastic smile and the feeling of hanging with friends. My hands down favorite is their French Toast...so fresh and delicious, every time. I'm not a vegan or vegetarian but love having the options when dining with friends and family who are. The small space is quite cozy-a couple of times I've even joined a table of strangers just because they were so busy with limited seating. Met some cool people that way-they seem to attract interesting, open minded types, probably because they are that way, themselves. Eat whatever strikes your fancy-there really are no bad choices. Every plate is a winner! Go-and be a winner too!"}
{"text":"It's so tough to find a good vegetarian lunch downtown if you just want a quick bite. Well Bragg's is the perfect solution... I tried their Secret Wonder Bat sandwich and it was delicious. I wanted to try every sandwich on the menu but their good portions prevented me from ordering more. I will absolutely come back to try their E.L.T. with eggplant \"bacon\". Just a great local spot for vegetarian/vegan options and it seems that they have great pies too!"}
{"text":"Oooh Bragg's Factory Diner, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways...  1.  I L-O-V-E that you try to avoid processed meat substitutes and more often opt for whole food options. 2. DELICIOUS vegan breakfast/brunch every day you're open! (Curry waffles?! \"Classic\" tofu scramble with pesto?? Mmm) 3. OMG you are open for dinner now!  (Helloooooo jackfruit barbacoa!) 4. Nicest people ever as owners and wait staff. 5. Fantastic choice of music always playing. 6. Tasty specials and evolving menu. 7. Cute and quirky atmosphere.  8. Vegan pies!!!!!!!!!!!!! I could have just had this one and been enough.   I tell everyone I know to go here and eat here at least once per week.. it really is that good. :c)"}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out! Not once, but twice! Yeah, it was THAT good. And I'd go back!  Super cute and quaint with a homey and cozy atmosphere in the heart of the Grand Ave art district.   They recently switched from vegetarian to 100% vegan! There's lots of gluten free options as well!  On my first visit, we ordered the Nopales Like Home with coleslaw (because they were out of their awesome potato salad) and the Jake the Snack nachos. The jackfruit barbacoa in the Nopales Like Home was delicious and the nopales were cooked to perfection. The nacho \"cheese\" on the nachos was so yummy and flavorful. Everything was perfect.  During my second visit, we ordered the Avo Sando and the Secret Wonder Bat, both with potato salad. The pesto on the Avo Sando is out of this world. I need the recipe! The Secret Wonder Bat is probably the closest thing you'll ever get to a Reuben. I was so surprised by how much it actually tasted like a Reuben! SO GOOD! Oh, and the potato salad... amazing!  Groupon has a good deal for Bragg's too, which was nice!   Service wasn't anything special.. but who likes to be bothered every 5 minutes when you're trying to enjoy a meal out? Honestly, I can't wait to go back and try more of their sammies and breakfast stuffs! It's worth it for the food, especially for the quality/freshness of it."}
{"text":"This place has been a blessing when I have had to work really late and I did not want to be relegated to Five Guys or Jack in the Box. I'm not a vegetarian but ya know, sometimes a girl wants to take a holiday! I have tried almost everything on the menu. I really like the chickpea burger and the beet burger (bathroom stool colors be damned). Not sure what seasonings they use for these patties, but they are always plenty flavorful. I give them props for the \"eggplant bacon\" which has a nice smokey taste.   As for the dessert, one time I stopped in there because I wanted a vegan chocolate orange pie, which was really smooth and light. I now follow them on Facebook just to see what dessert is in the pipeline.   I love the classic American diner feel with the different salt and pepper shakers on each table and the carousel for the desserts. Also, every staffer I've ever interacted with has been really nice. I hope they stay around for a long time."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast/brunch with a friend who is vegan. I had the early birdito and she had the classic (both made with tofu and a side of eggplant \"bacon\"). Both of us enjoyed our meal and the cute atmosphere of the place. The birdito is a hearty hemp seed chorizo, bell pepper, and onion breakfast wrap with good flavor. I had never had a tofu scramble before, and the difference in texture from eggs was noticeable at first but the taste was wonderful. The entire menu is vegetarian/vegan (all desserts and pastries are vegan), so it's great for people who follow those kinda of diets.  The eggplant \"bacon\" was not what we expected. It was really just cooked sliced eggplant. Good if you like eggplant in general though. Excellent service and delicious coffee (with almond milk) from a local roaster (Xanadu) made this an all-around great meal. Both of us left happy with our choices, with a tasty dessert for later (the gluten-free almond butter brownie is great!), and deciding that we needed to return to sample the lunch menu and/pie options."}
{"text":"really cool place for brunch - very vegan/vegetarian friendly. great service and fresh food options!"}
{"text":"I just drove all the way here, hungry and excited, because yelp says this place closes at 10pm. Apparently they are currently on their \"summer hours\" and close at 4pm. I do not understand this summer hours concept and I REALLY don't understand why you wouldn't update your yelp page to reflect this."}
{"text":"Liam is a great cook - but, I prefer it when he waits on our table.  We had lunch there this week and the service was just ok.  Not the usual \"Liam service\" we're used to when we make it down there with the kids for lunch.  The food is always great.  I would always recommend the sauteed veggies for your side - always delicious!  Tried my friend's side of cole slaw and it was way to vinegar-y for my taste... pure acid.  Anyhow, we love it here and hope they continue to be successful b/c they are the best vegetarian restaurant in the area (actually, we think in all of Phoenix).  Just get there early for lunch, b/c they get busy and the place is tiny (one of the reasons we like it, but it gets crowded!)."}
{"text":"So good! I was impressed. The place is tiny and super kitschy, and it is perhaps not the fastest place. But the servers are friendly, the food is delicious, and I can't wait to go back! Seriously, I had no idea vegan pies could be so delicious. I highly recommend Bragg's!"}
{"text":"Our waitress this morning, Leslie, was very nice. She pointed us in the right direction when needed. Have us recommendations, and thought we were in a band (there was 5 of us).  Needless to say we weren't in a band, but just a bunch of hungry dudes in search of what Phoenix has to offer. We found this place on Yelp AND I didn't tell the rest of the party that this place was Vegan.  When they did discover this they were not bummed, but rolled with it.  Everyone ordered something different and only 2 people joined the clean plate club this morning. I ordered the Gluten free waffle with chocolate chips and walnuts. I ordered the side Jackfruit Barbacoa, per Leslie's request....and it ruled! It was spicy and hit the spot. It was the perfect compliment to the sweetness from the waffle. Overall this place is awesome. Small, quaint, happy. Even if you're not Vegan, go ahead and give it a try....you won't be disappointed. Next time the band returns to Phoenix we'll be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"1. I do NOT do veggies...pizza is ALWAYS meat lovers,   I'm the girl who consistently tells waitstaff to remove anything beyond corn, peas, or green beans. That said my family MADE me try Bragg's a little over a year ago...and I stayed \"safe\" ordering French toast...um, WOW!!!! I didn't even use syrup it was so yummy!!! Since then, I have eaten here about every 4-6 weeks (STILL not big on veggies--but at Bragg's they don't taste like veggies!!!) I love the the banana bread waffles, the curry waffles, the pancakes, the French toast, the nachos, the barbacoa, the chick pea burger (I LOVE getting the chick pea burger with a bit of barbacoa on top!!!! OMG OMG OMG!!!!) I haven't even TOUCHED on the amazing baked goods--RAW BROWNIES--who knew??? And the Amazing Bars remind me of my Nana's homemade yumminess, and each time I go in, there seems to be some new twist on donuts!!!   2.  This is an old fashioned cafe...a REAL mom & pop place!!! It's quirky, it's fun, GREAT music, an eleclectic customer base!!!  I've read reviews about extended wait times and \"off\" days...I haven't experienced either...but, being a business minded person, it kinda makes sense--I'm guessing these kids have put it all on the line to recreate veggies--and they've done a darned good job of it (again, I do not do veggies--but here, I don't know what they do, but my heart and arteries LOVE them for it)  3.  Go, try...if it seems to be an off day; give it another try...if you're in a huge rush; maybe call ahead to order???  I've done this for work lunches and quick stop dinners, and it has worked for me.  Good job guys...keep it up!!"}
{"text":"So glad we were up for an adventure this morning. What a wonderful place full of comfort like grandma's house. Make the trip and enjoy a wonderful breakfast with the family."}
{"text":"Go Here.  It bothers me that there is most likely some crazy line at Matt's down the street and there are very few ppl sitting in this new diner this beautiful Sunday Morning.    Bragg's took me by surprise.  After seeing a fellow Yelper check-in to it a week or so ago, I bookmarked it, and put it at the top of my list based upon the menu.  I'm certainly not a vegetarian and definitely not a vegan....but the combinations of flavor, vegetables, and your normal breakfast delicacies make this place a No-Brainer to visit.   I had the Mexican Chocolate Donut, a very warm/fresh Cinnamon Raisin Scone, and the Coconut Curry Waffle with a side of Rose Mary Potatoes and Sweet Potatoes.  sooooooo good.   I'm so glad I went here .  Didn't even feel like AZ...felt a little like quirky Austin."}
{"text":"We went for brunch and the food was delicious :) Im not vegan or vegetarian, but who the hell cares! The eggplant bacon weirded me out a bit texture-wise, but everything else was amazing."}
