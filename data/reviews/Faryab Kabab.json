{"text":"Food is good but portions size is vwry small i asked for salad and kabobs but the salad was a mini quater plate for 13 its really a small portion but yes the kabobs were fresh"}
{"text":"Delicious koobideh plate here. Served with rice, a little salad, but definitely the star of the plate here is the koobideh. Well seasoned, juicy, fresh and perfectly cooked. If only they had some burnt rice, this would be 5/5!"}
{"text":"Very good! I got the Kebab Koobideh (ground beef) and it was well seasoned and perfectly cooked. The meal is only 6.99+tax and comes with rice charbroiled tomatoes and a salad. Authentic persian and delicious!"}
{"text":"Closed - came by tonight to find it has changed the owner. Now called Faryab Kabab Restaurant. Bought some takeout, will see how the food tastes. Most of the same menu, no lamb kebab though. Also only the ground beef kebab (koobideh) not the beef kebab (barq) any more."}
{"text":"Been to this a couple of times. Excellent food at good prices. Love the tea they provide at the end. Nice friendly staff definitely a place to visit"}
