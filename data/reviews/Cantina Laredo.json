{"text":"This is a favorite place for my wife and I to grab a margarita. This is arguably the best margarita in the Valley. We love to visit during their reverse happy hour.   Most recently, my wife threw my birthday party at Cantina Laredo and their staff pulled it off without one issue. Our party of over 20 was served promptly and with a smile.   We love Cantina Laredo: their food and their wonderful service. If you're looking for great cuisine and amazing beverages, we highly recommend trying Cantina Laredo."}
{"text":"The happy hour specials and guac are amazing. I wish I could come everyday just for those 2 items."}
{"text":"Great service.  Good advice from the waiter.   Want to come back with my wife during Happy hour"}
{"text":"Recommend by a local as the best Mexican food in Scottsdale. As the best Mexican food in town. The feeders were one of the best I've ever had.  The brownie for dessert which my wife flipped over.  One of the best meals we had during our trip. Service was great the chips and dip were unique and amazing. Another reason to come back to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Food is decent but WAY overpriced. Two very small street tacos for around $12. For how slow they are, they are surprisingly understaffed. We had to constantly flag someone down for refills or even to place food orders. The best things on the menu are the desserts. Every single one is great. Great atmosphere. It's a super cute restaurant. Just poorly ran and overpriced."}
{"text":"One of my favorite happy hour spots! The vibes are always good there. And the staff is always friendly :)"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on a work day.  I met my parents who brought my toddler so we could all eat together.  The waitress was friendly and patient with my toddler.  She brought out a sample of a sauce when my mother worried about it being too spicy.  We were in and out and I was back at work on time.   Now to the food.  I ordered enchiladas with avocado and artichokes.  My mother ordered cheese and onion enchiladas.  My father ordered chicken enchiladas.  All were delicious.  I especially loved my avocado and artichoke enchiladas.  They were fresh and tasty and I didn't leave with a heavy-feeling stomach.  The cheese enchiladas were also very good.  The black beans were very bland but the rice was delicious.  I would happily go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Bottom line: This was my first time in and I won't be back.  I went to dinner last night with a group of 10 other women for a bachelorette dinner. We had reservations for 7:30 and when we showed up, we were shown to our table in the back pretty quickly...however we were told they were out of menus. Um, what?   Our server showed up and asked us what we wanted to drink, and then we proceeded to wait approximately 20 minutes for drinks. When we ordered drinks, we also ordered guacamole and queso dip. In all this time, we still had not received menus. One of the women in our group went up to the front to ask for menus and was told she could only have 6.   The guacamole was made at the table and was decent. However, no queso to be found. Our orders for food were taken (various people were still missing drinks, mind you) and then we waited for food. The queso finally came out right before our food and had the film on top that you get when warm cheese sits too long....yuck. I wasn't impressed. When the food came out, it was a disaster (as was expected). The servers were calling out what they had then trying to figure out where on the table it went. Also one pair had decided to share a dish and ordered it as vegetarian, with no meat. It came out with chicken. Again, all during this process, people were missing drinks.   I ordered the camarones escondidos and while the grilled chicken was flavorful, the rice (half a scoop at best) was clearly pre-made, almost like from a box. Dehydrated peas were included that weren't rehydrated enough.  Earlier in the night, someone had ordered a pitcher of margaritas. After a 30 minute wait with no margarita pitcher in sight, we asked for it. The waiter said oh you need another? We said we never received the first one. They brought it out in 5 minutes and it tasted like sweet and sour mix in water. And at $30 a pitcher!!!!!!!!!  Someone had ordered a bottle of champagne, which was served to us in flute glasses, except they had to go back to the kitchen to get more glasses because they hadn't brought out enough for the whole table. Those who received their champagne in the second round of glasses all had dirty glasses!!!!!! You could see and feel the dirt/soap/whatever it was on the glasses.  Two of us went and spoke with the manager about how the evening was less than stellar, there were missed orders all night, missed drinks, the watery margaritas, etc. He was apologetic and took the pitcher of margaritas off the menu...and that was it.   I was extremely disappointed in the whole process. While we were there for a bachelorette, this was pre-going out, so no one was drunk, no one was rude, it was supposed to be a pleasant dinner and was anything but.   Again, I will not be back to this restaurant and I would encourage you to save your time and money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Such a great spot! I've been here several times and am never disappointed. Today I was there with a group of six for a business meeting and the food was wonderful. We ordered the cevichi and guacamole to share both were great. This was my first time having either one and they will now become a staple. The guacamole is made to order and ours had a wonderful kick to it. The chips are warm from the oven and the two salsas they serve with them are wonderful, I particularly like the warm one. I shared with my co-worker so I got a barbacoa (brisket) taco and an al pastor taco. While both were good the al pastor did not have the kick I require in al pastor; the barbacoa on the other hand was spectacular and i will be ordering it again next time I go. Several of the ladies I had lunch with enjoyed the salmon which was the fish of the day and all three said they would order it again. The service was good not great my water ran dry a few times but overall our waitress Amanda was very respectful of the fact that we were in fact having a meeting and was careful not to interrupt."}
{"text":"We usually don't go to chain restaurants, but my wife has been wanting to give this one a try. What a mistake!! The cold salsa was decent, but we just couldn't understand the warm salsa. Maybe it works back east or in Colorado, but in Arizona when the temperature outside is 110 at 7:00 p.m. it doesn't work. We started with the guacamole table side, which was no big deal. Like Joe D. said \"we can make it better and cheaper at home\", I couldn't agree more. For dinner I ordered the Oaxaca Camerones, which were wrapped in bacon and stuffed with jalapenos and oaxaca cheese. Now I have ordered this dish in many Mexican restaurant, minus the jalapeno. I can't figure out why these did not even compare to any of the others I have had. The dish is so simply to prepare, but the shrimp tasted dry and the bacon was way to fatty. My wife ordered the Tacos Cascabel, soft tacos with sauteed chicken in a cascabel sauce, which were way to spicy. I love spicy Mexican food and she had me taste one, I couldn't finish the thing it was so hot.   I usually don't write bad reviews, because I have been in the restaurant business for almost 20 years and I know how tough it is. Since I grew up in Arizona with real Mexican food I felt this chain needed to be reviewed. I just don't understand why people who live in Arizona or come here to visit would want to go to a chain Mexican restaurant. We have some of the best authentic Mexican restaurants in the United States! Viva Arizona!"}
{"text":"I have dined here numerous times and I can highly recommend the drinks, food and service. I love the guacamole, the enchiladas and tacos. I come back again and again for the mango margaritas at happy hour...to die for."}
{"text":"We frequent here often and I have to say the chicken fajitas are the bomb!!! Great drinks and overall good food and drinks. I highly recommend this place to anyone that is craving some Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I would return here for happy hour - margarita and chips and salsa or guacamole, but never again for dinner.  The fire roasted salsa and my house margarita were pretty good, but our entrees were marginal and extremely over priced.  I ordered the Mahi Tacos - they were flavorless, except for the overwhelming amount of red onion. My husband ordered the Shrimp Enchiladas, and was served the Spinach and Mushroom Enchiladas instead... My dad, who eats all things Mexican, only ate half of his plate.  If you're a foodie, skip it.  If you're not concerned with flavor, but enjoy a nice atmosphere, this might be a place for you."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to dinner here on a Saturday evening. He ordered the Carne Asada w/ sauteed onions and I ordered the Carne Asada that's wrapped around a poblano chili that had cheese, shrimp and mushrooms inside. Exquisite! The steak was cooked perfectly to order and the flavor? Amazing! The service was excellent and the drinks were superb. I ordered the Pomegranate margarita. To die for! At the end we ordered the apple pie. It came served on a sizzling plate with a scoop of cinnamon ice cream on top. Excellent end to an excellent meal! We will be dining here again soon!"}
{"text":"I stopped in today as I had a taste for fish tacos. I was greeted by Caroline who promptly took me to my table and took my drink order. She came back quickly made a few suggestions about the menu, recommended the fish tacos as they were sauteed mahi mahi, so naturally I jumped on this! Two minutes later two different types of salsa and crispy warm chips were presented. (best salsa ever, the tomatillo is served warm!! It's got some heat to it and it's delish) Probably 10 minutes later my taco's were served with cilantro rice and black beans. I don't care for cilantro and mentioned to Caroline I would ask for the taco's to be served with out it next time, at that time she offered to get me tomato rice to replace the other, I turned it down, I had enough food to eat as it was! The taco's were a delicious. Overall the experience was great.Even the manager Dave stopped by to say hello and check on me. And not once did I have to hear my yound server say NO PROBLEM!! She was professional and gracious, I'll go back for sure, can't wait to have a margarita next time."}
{"text":"Love this place! I love the ambiance, atmosphere, the people and the menu!    Designed as a \"nicer\" restaurant, but with all of the amenities of \"home away from home\". We went on a Thursday afternoon along with a couple of business-attired folks sitting at the bar working at their lap tops, several booths with 4-5 people and a couple of families.  The server brought chips & salsa to the table and then we enjoyed the taco salad and tortilla soup (very, very good!) and the three combo plate.    Both meals were very good, worth the price (total bill was $20 + tip), but what made this adventure enjoyable was our server.  She was very personable, professional and really delightful.  We asked if she was the owner and she replied \"no\", but just really loved her job!  WOW - don't hear that every day.  The Owner did visit our table and chat with us a bit ... which was very nice.  I'm all about good customer service and this place definitely did not disappoint.  Looks like they even have a (big) room in the back for meetings or networking events.   Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"The guacamole prepared table-side and the pablano pepper stuffed with cheese, spinach and shrimp wrapped in steak was fantastic.  First time there, will definitely come back. Hadn't noticed it before on the corner of Scottsdale and Frank Lloyd Wright.  Service outstanding, chips were crisp and light could eat two bowls and still have room for dinner.  The salsa was fresh, the hot-spicy was outstanding and so perfect.  Atmosphere was authentic, and food is so fresh, the general manger was ordering the next day vegetables as we were coming in. Top Hat!!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT food and EXCELLENT service. I have been coming here since they opened. Usually here for the happy hour, which is incredible value for the bar food. As we know, most \"restaurants\" in vegas suck. Not this place. Could stand up to any top mexican joint in this country. The bartenders are exceptional. Again, a rare achievement. Whoever is running this place deserves great credit for bringing quality and service to a town that greatly needs it. btw, their bathroom is immaculate!"}
{"text":"They have some good things in their menu I can't promise everything will be to your liking. My 3 amigos margarita was delicious and worth the price because the coronita keeps on giving, like two drinks in one. I didn't take a picture of my tacos de pollo (chicken tacos) $13.29, but they were delicious and I do recommend them. Queso Laredo (appetizer) was good but nothing to rave about. Just some nacho cheese and ground beef, top with pico. I enjoyed my time here."}
{"text":"Second time dinning here for Sunday brunch on the patio. Best omelette I've ever had and you can't beat the free mimosa! However, the service both times has been sub-par. With that said, we'll continue to come back because the prices are great, atmosphere is beautiful, and the good is delicious!"}
{"text":"Really great place to have lunch and meet with friends or have a business meeting. I really love the fresh made guacamole table side, nice touch!"}
{"text":"The food, drinks, and bartender Jose were amazing. They have  a great happy hour menu and the staff is very helpful. I always get the fish tacos when I'm there."}
{"text":"We were in town for a week and my Uncle mentioned that Cantina Laredo had great food. We decided to give it a try.  Sat on the patio, Duke our server was fabulous!  Super nice, very attentive and friendly!  He offered suggestions and they were great!  Food was delicious, a lil modern flare.  I would recommend CL 100%, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"What a great experience tonight! 5 of us in our party - my wife and I, her parents and our son.  Simone, our server was fantastic: She did a great job explaining  the options for my wife's food allergies (egg, dairy and wheat) and together they designed a tasty enchilada recipe. I enjoyed the Enchilada Mole.  Three others had Carnitas - braised pork shanks with chipotle-wine sauce - very tasty and a bit spicy.  We've been here a number of times and have never been disappointed. Greatly appreciate the flexibility for those with complex food allergies."}
{"text":"Las night was their soft opening. What an amazing job they did. They make fresh guacomole at the table. The servers were very well prepared. Very Friendly, knowledgeable and just plain happy to be there.   Now on to the food, my husband and I agreed the best enchiladas we have every had. Margaritas equally as good. I highly recommend Cantina Laredo at Tivoli Village!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place.  The staff is friendly and helpful and make you feel at home.  The food is great, and although I haven't order it....They make some dessert that comes out sizzling and seems like heaven!  I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant and the customer service.  I am unable to eat several types of food and they specialized a dish just for me and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"We were excited to try the happy hour menu at this new place in Tivoli Village. That excitement quickly turned into dismay as we experienced the shitty service and crappy food. When we do happy hour, although we prefer sitting at a table, oftentimes we sit at the bar counter if we are concerned about slow service by the waitstaff. Typically, the bartenders do a much better job refilling your water and attending to you than the regular waitstaff. Unfortunately, this was the exception to that rule. Frankly, this was probably some of the worst service we've ever had sitting at the bar. We are very understanding if the bar/restaurant is busy, but this wasn't one of those cases. The bartender asked if we were interested in the happy hour menu and what we wanted to drink. We replied yes and we would start with ice water until we had a chance to peruse the menu. He acknowledged us but then proceeded to take care of other bar customers for the next several minutes before eventually serving us ice water. We got impatient waiting for him to give us a menu so we grabbed a menu that had been placed aside by one of the other customers sitting a few seats away.  We decided to order the Mahi Mahi fish tacos ($13), pork al pastor tacos ($11), ahi tuna tacos ($9) and steak flatbread ($11) and save room for the mango tres leches for dessert. The tacos came in orders of 3. Everything was half-price for happy hour, except for desserts. We were served a complimentary basket of tortilla chips and 2 kinds of salsa, mild and spicy. The chips were unusually thin and the salsas unremarkable. Our order came out pretty quickly, about 10-15 minutes after we ordered. The flatbread was huge. It was not bad but not great and also the best dish by far. The pork al pastor was a distant second and quite disappointing. Instead of pieces of pork sliced off a rotating spit, it consisted of ground pork marinated with Mexican spices but severely lacking in salt. The Mahi Mahi tacos were bland and very skimpy on the fish and drowning in a raw red onion \"salsa\" which completely drowned out other flavors. The ahi tuna tacos were our least favorite. They were unusually sweet and soggy due to the extremely watery and bland guacamole underneath. On our way to the restroom, we spotted their dessert display tray sitting on a random counter. We were hoping that perhaps dessert would bring some minor redemption, but the mango tres leches did not look legit so we decided to pass.  Now, let's continue talking about the service. After telling our bartender that we only wanted to drink water, he asked if we were sure we didn't want a margarita. I find this second-guessing and upselling tactic incredibly annoying. If I wanted to order an alcoholic drink, then I would've ordered one. To add insult to injury, we had to attempt to get his attention and wave him down numerous times for everything from water refills, getting the check, and even for eating utensils, believe it or not! At least a couple of times, our water glasses were completely empty and ignored even though he was standing directly in front of us after he finished entering orders into the register. Once we finally got our check the bartender actually had the gall to say \"Sorry about the poor service tonight. We just got slammed. I hope you understand.\" Oh, really? Maybe, we're both blind because it certainly didn't appear busy at all. In fact, the place was mostly empty. Listen if you're going to own up to poor service, then don't try to justify it with some BS excuse. Hey Luis, understand this: you are lucky that we still tipped you 10% on the happy hour pricing instead of a big fat goose egg. We usually tip 15% on the regular non-discounted pricing, but this guy didn't even deserve what we gave him.  In summary, inauthentic Mexican food that is gross to subpar even by Americanized standards combined with abysmal service gets Cantina Laredo 1.5 stars. Since my wife rounded up to 2 stars, I'm rounding down to 1. Frankly, we were shocked by how pathetic both the food and service were. We expected that this place would rate at least 3 stars, but I guess you never know for sure until you try. Never again."}
{"text":"Relaxed, comfortable setting. Excellent drinks. Mango mint Mojito with ginger beer will be on my mind every Friday. Beef barbacoa street tacos and the apple pie with the hot buttery bourbon syrup. Ahhhhh."}
{"text":"Came here for date night. We had a great time!  I think our server's name is Miguel. He was really nice and friendly. He seems to love working there and said the company transferred him from their location in Dallas, I believe. Anyway, it always makes dinner extra nice when you are served by someone who is happy to be there.  The margaritas were delicious, and so was the guacamole that Miguel prepared for us tableside.  Crab cakes had a nice kick to them and fajitas were good too.  But the best part of our meal was the apple pie served on a sizzling hot plate with cinnamon ice cream and a delicious sauce poured over it. WOW!  It tasted like world peace.  mmm... we can't wait to go back just for that!"}
{"text":"I'm amazed that this place got 4 stars - possibly the worst Mexican food I have ever had. I ordered iced tea and the chimichanga pollo, which comes with rice and beans. The iced tea tasted like it was made with unfiltered municipal water (i.e. nasty chemical taste). The only thing on my plate that had much of any flavor at all were the beans. I cut into the chimi and there was a POOL of grease underneath it. Of course I know chimis are fried, but they must not have allowed this one to drain before plating it. It just simply tasted like grease. The rice was truly devoid of flavor, at least any flavor that was pleasant.  I waited 30 minutes for my food to arrive. I was on lunch break from work, so by the time I got my food I had 15 minutes to eat it. Any server who works weekday lunch shift should realize that someone who is eating alone and dressed in work attire (I have a logo embroidered on my shirt) is on a limited lunch break. My server took my order, someone else brought it out (they were NOT busy), then she asked how things were after I finally got my food but before I'd had a chance to try it. I didn't see her again. I had to flag down the manager to ask for my check. He was kind & apologetic for the delay, and gave me a discount (which is why I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1) but I didn't see my server again until, as I was getting up from my seat to head back To work, asked if I wanted an iced tea to go. A nice gesture, but too late. I won't be going back. If only the food was bad, or only the service was bad, I would give them another shot and chalk it up to a bad day, but when both are bad I'm out."}
{"text":"The food doesn't seem quite as tasty as it once was.  We have shifted to other restaurants.  I'm trying to be more specific about our criticisms.  Other Yelpers need to understand that we moved to Las Vegas from Texas, and we are used to Tex-Mex with fairly robust flavors--not the more mild flavors favored by people from some other parts of the country.   We also prefer New Mexican-Mex food to Tex-Mex.  The spices used for Mexican food in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona can be fairly strong, and we like it that way.  I believe that Cantina Laredo is Texas based, but the chefs and cooks in the Las Vegas Cantina Laredo seemingly have taken a less spicy route to the cooking than we found on our earlier visits, which has left the food a little too bland for our tastes but not bad."}
{"text":"People seem to either really enjoy this place or detest it.  I've been to the restaurant a few times and I can understand why this dichotomy may exist.  The first couple of times, the dining experience was truly enjoyable.  The food was flavorful, the salsas had a kick and complemented the meal.  Although the service was decent, he was not as attentive as I thought he should be, i.e., checking for drink reorders, salsa refills, etc. On the whole, though, everyone enjoyed the dining experience;  each person seemed to enjoy their meal.  However, on the last occasion, the service staff seemed to be overwhelmed.  We had two families dining together and a number of kids with us.  The service was really slow but at least the server was apologetic.  For all visits, the food has been consistently good and so I have to say that I'd be willing to go back.  The restaurant has a nice ambiance, especially if you get a table closer to the fireplace.  However, the establishment needs to improve the consistency of its service level."}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo has been open in our neighborhood for some time now.  My husband and I finally had some free time to dine there.  Reception was fine, waitress came and offer drinks - that was fine.  Everything seems normal.  Nothing superb.   We each ordered a Margarita, then our entrees.  The waitress came by a few times to see if every thing is alright while we were eating our dinner. Then, the waitress just came and slapped down our check without us asking for it, and also without her first asking whether we wanted dessert.    Meanwhile, a special Tequila dinner announcement was enclosed with our check (which we did not asked for).  The food looked interesting and I asked this waitress whether we can have the dinner without Tequila.  Guess what she said? - ?.\"You don't have to come!\" We were completely stunned at this point having been very nice and cordial to her through the whole time we were there. We will give the food 3 stars, but the attitude 0 star because she was too mean for us to imagine the management philosophy behind her actions."}
{"text":"Great food and happy hour!  A bit more upscale then I anticipated but the atmosphere was comfortable and inviting. I kid you not my food came out in 5 minutes and was amazing!"}
{"text":"My favorite (modern) Mexican dining spot.  Healthy options, incredible desserts and a great atmosphere.  Fish tacos, table side guacamole, chips and the sizzling brownie are incredible.  But if you're looking for \"hole in the wall\" authentic, this is not the place :)"}
{"text":"Great service and food, really top notch. I have been to this location as well as the one in Gilbert. Do yourself a favor and get the table side guac, you wont regret it."}
{"text":"Saturday happy hour at Cantina Laredo is by far the best deal going. Chips and salsa are very good and always very quick to your table. Half price deals on menu items and drinks can't be beat. Eddy the Cuban bartender is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We heard of this place because of the resort we were staying at. There was no wait, and our waiter was very friendly. We were given free Top Shelf guacamole by showing our key card (we were staying at the Scottsdale Links Resort) and it was pretty good. I ordered the chicken fajitas. They were great. Caramelized peppers, and all the fix-ins. I would definitely order this again. The reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the pricing. It was just too much money for my budget, but the portion sizes were fine. (Unlike the other reviews, I had leftovers to take back).   I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"We chose to eat a late lunch on a Wednesday around 2:30. The decor is quite modern and wide open. There was a definitely a chill in the air so we ordered coffee. The waitress was very accommodating in regards to inquiries about the menu. Our coffee was lukewarm and it took 25 minutes for our lunch to arrive. The spinach enchiladas were boring and prepared using very small tortillas. The brisket tacos were tough to chew, dry and lacking any distinct flavor. Rice and beans were good and small in portion size. Did I mention the coffee? The waitress never checked to see if we needed a refill. Overall, we were disappointed in the quality of the food, portion size, flavor and service."}
{"text":"Everyone is friendly which is really important to me. The good vibe is always welcomed. The food is always good and I can't wait to eat there again!"}
{"text":"I visit this location often for it's great happy hour.  The food, drink and value are great, however, the service is consistently very poor in the bar area."}
{"text":"One of the first places I went to when moving here.  Love it.  The cocktails are stiff and HH food is cheap and delicious.   Has a really nice patio area to sit outside. Service is good."}
{"text":"Though we were initially pretty impressed with the restaurant, our hopes for an enjoyable and filling lunch came crashing down pretty quickly.   I do agree on a few points with some of the previous reviews. The chips and salsas were great. I asked for some extra hot salsa and our server (Adrien?) quickly made up some extra hot salsa that, along with the two other types already served, ended up being pretty much all I ate.   As others have already stated, the service was great, the atmosphere was nice, but we walked out the door looking for somewhere to go eat.   My wife ordered the Enchilada De Espinaca (sauteed spinach, monterey jack cheese and mushroom enchilada) and asked to have chicken added. She ended up with what looked good at first, but turned out to be steamed white-meat chicken and spinach ONLY inside the enchilada. No mushrooms or cheese.   I ordered the Chile Relleno and was expecting to be asked if i wanted cheese or whatever 'Picadillo' was, but since I was just a little busy getting my daughter to not create a new lab experiment with the salsa and her sprite, I pretty much hoped for the best when our server just walked away. I was very suprised to find ground beef (yes hamburger) sliced almonds and a semi-sweet spice mix filling my relleno. Since I enjoy almonds and most other nuts as much as my daughters enjoy sushi, that blew my whole meal. Did I mention the almonds sprinkled on the side dish (some kind of pan-fried potatoes)?   The two stars are only granted for two items...a decent kids menu with enough options to even satisfy my two picky chitlens and the fact the person who appeared to be the head chef came out of the back and personally apologized to us and comped the entire meal (including the corn-dog and chicken fingers my girls scarfed down.)   We may give it one more try because we are always looking for someplace we can get at least decent food while also satisfying our two princesses.   I hope they can get the back of the line in order since i don't know any restaurant that can survive long-term on happy hour, chip and dessert fans."}
{"text":"I have been to Cantina Laredo a handful of times now, and have yet to have a poor experience. I think my favorite entree is the enchiladas y asada plate. Amazing!  On my last lunch date at Cantina, I was introduced to their apple pie. I was told it smelled like heaven. Now, I have yet to actually smell heaven, but if I could image what heaven might someday smell like, Cantina's apple pie is right up there. It is served on a hot skillet and drenched in brandied butter sauce... to die for!   I've always had good service and received beverages, food and chip refills in a timely manner. I will absolutely return to Cantina Laredo again soon - especially since there aren't many nice Mexican restaurants in the Summerlin area."}
{"text":"Ahi tuna tacos are very fresh and tasty. Alex at the bar is hella good peeps! Definitely stop by and knock back a margarita or two... If you are adventurous... A shot ot two of tequila is an excellent way to start an evening! MUY BUENO!!"}
{"text":"Craving Mexican but want something healthier or a little different? Cantina Laredo has it all baby! I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with fresh asparagus and cilantro-lime rice! All I can say is \"WOW.\" Totally knocked my socks off! Serving size was just right and the server was attentive and cheery."}
{"text":"This our 4th trip. And as always it has been Outstanding !! Amanda has been our   Waitress on two of these visits, and the Service has been second to none. We have had multiple selections from there Menu from the Queso Laredo, Top Shelf Guacamole, Tacos, Asada Steak and let's not forget the Mexican Apple Pie. All of them are to die for. This has become one of most Favorite Restaurant's. KUDOS TO THE WHOLE STAFF!!!!"}
{"text":"I read the previous reviews and seriously, what did y'all order?? I have been to Laredo over 6 times in 3 months and have had a very delicious, fresh and hot meal each time. My mom and I have eaten lunch and dinner there during on- and off-peak hours and have consistently good food. She is a very excellent cook herself and would tell the waiter if something was not to her liking. The salsa was perfect each time, with just the right amount of heat and spice, not overwhelmingly tomato-y or salty. In fact, I told the chef (who was leaving for the day) that I came from SF to have his salsa and he prepared a pound of FRESH chips and a pint of my favorite salsa to go, with a thank you note (he did this in less than 5 minutes). I've never had such consistently delicious food, great service, and wonderful dining moments in the area than at Laredo."}
{"text":"First of all, the guacamole made table-side is ridiculous good. I don't even like guac and I LOVED it. The margaritas are also delicious. The service was friendly and fast and the menu has a pretty good selection. I had a really good steak and shrimp and my girlfriend had some tasty fish tacos. I can't wait till we go back and enjoy the nice outside patio!"}
{"text":"Absolutely blown away by the good reviews on ths place!! We spent $65 on a meal and drinks here and quite simply wished we hadn't.  The best thing was the guacamole they make at your table.  The bartender was a pretencious and less than desireable human to be around.  Not much else to say...skip!!!"}
{"text":"It passed my test - namely, would I come back. Yes! Like what others have noted, chips and salsas were very good. I had a chicken enchilada/taco (combo #something) and the chicken was cooked perfectly. Plating was modern and well done with just the right portion size. The decor was semi-upscale and very clean. Service was friendly and consistent. An unexpected find for a mall."}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo is an outstanding up-scale Mexican restaurant.  The food might best be described as gourmet style with a southwest flair.  Everything is consistently delicious and very good quality.  We always enjoy their happy hour because they offer great dishes at reduced prices.  At 5.00 during happy hour, their house margaritas are perfection, not the typical ripoff made from bottled mix and little or no tequila.  They use fresh lime juice, Cointreau, sweetner and 100% agave tequila.  Delicious!  Service is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Got a seat no problem. But waited 15 minutes and no servers even came to offer us a water. Granted it was NFL playoff weekend but the place was empty and all the staff were standing around watching tv. Waste of time. Even if the food would be good it's unacceptable to ignore your guests."}
{"text":"The food was terrible and very poor quality.  The \"beef\" enchiladas were disgusting with their horrible ground beef and chilly poured on top.  It was NO where close to authentic Mexican food.  The Mole was very bland.  The food did NOT justify the high prices. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  I will Not eat here again!!"}
{"text":"I truly agree with several of the other reviews regarding service and food. I feel as though every time I go back to this restaurant in general it becomes more subpar. From the host to the server that we had it was terrible. We had to continually ask for drink refills as well as chips which we shouldn't have to do considering we had ordered the guacamole made at the table. The restaurant was not busy at all and they had plenty of servers so there is no excuse. The chicken that was on the fajitas was beyond dry. The fish on the fish tacos had no flavor. For good Mexican food in that area Pancho's is so much better which it appears people are finding out. It really is ashame because we spend a lot of time in Tivoli Village because of a kid program they have there. I definitely have seen an overall decline and it appears to be affecting business as they are now on Groupon and the restaurant never seems busy anymore. I doubt we will be coming back anytime soon unless the chain decides to employ new management to turn this particular location around."}
{"text":"the carnitas tacos and spicy pork tacos were very good - so was the guacamole they made table side.  wine list was just ok, nothing real original, but the margarita list looked good.  i would say its worth going back to!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place , great staff must try the home made apple pie it's delicious !"}
{"text":"Food was excellent...the salsas were very flavorful and the tacos were first rate! We'd definitely visit this place again!"}
{"text":"I came to Cantina Laredo with my parents and was pleasantly surprised. I know that this is a chain restaurant so I was expecting a typical chain experience, but this was not the case. Our server was gracious, friendly, and accommodating.  The chips and salsa were warm and delicious, our food was served quickly, and our waiter was extremely friendly. I've gone back twice since I started this review in Jan 2014 (hehe) and have loved it every time. The margaritas (house or non) are great. A great place to come for dates, family time, etc."}
{"text":"Went on Valentine's Day and the service was great.  Didn't have the special menu but ordered off the regular menu.  Enchiladas were fabulous---and really healthy--filling but not heavy.  Margarita was PERFECT!"}
{"text":"100% yummy in my tummy. Cesar took great care of us and the food was perfect. My mother and I never finish our food but tonight we made an exception. Flavor town hit us were it counts and we were down for the count."}
{"text":"The food at this place was awesome. The camarones rellano was fantastic. Service was pretty good for as busy as it was. It was a great experience over all."}
{"text":"Compared to the other places I have tried so far this was pretty good. I liked the salsa. It was smokey flavored and nicely spiced but not too hot. The chips were a bit salty The meal, Lorado Combination Plate, was very good. Some of the best Mexican food I have had out of a restaurant in the Phoenix area. Yum!"}
{"text":"Seriously good salsa! Awesome service and food. Love the margaritas, too!"}
{"text":"Poor Service, Good Food.  While the restaurant was not busy when we went for lunch at 2:00pm yesterday, it took more than 30 minutes for our server to take our order.  Once the food arrived, everyone enjoyed what they ordered.  The fresh-made guacamole was excellent.  With good service, I'd give this either 4 or 5 stars."}
{"text":"So over priced and extremely small portions. The waitress made us table side guacamole and it was inedible because she put so much lime in it. Also, my friend and I sat at the table and chatted for about 20 min and the waitress kept walking by with an evil eye. The place wasn't busy nor was it close to closing time. I wouldn't recommend eating here. So many other great Mexican places. Also the website doesn't show a menu."}
{"text":"Went there as a girls night and when we walked it it was totally dead. I was worried that maybe we picked a dud as somewhere to try out. But I was so wrong!! The staff was incredible, the food was AMAZING, and if you go, you have got to save room for the Mexican Apple Pie. It's seriously to die for! I am so excited to go back again! I totally recommend it."}
{"text":"If I could, I would give this 0 rating. No greeting, no courtesy by the ushers. The person who served us was totally lost. No motivation, no enthusiasm whatsoever! The entire place was littered, tables were left uncleaned after people had eaten and left, what an ambience! The complimentary tortilla chips that were served were not \"cooked\", who wants a stomach upset eating raw tortilla chips? The server did not know descriptions of food items served, so on and on, very bad experience. Terrible food by the way! Oh and please tell your staff to smile if possible, if they don't - there must be some problem with this work place. Will never return. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice, beautiful restaurant and great outdoor place. Service?The server was nice, recommended the house specialty margarita: not so great.  It took a while before he came back to take our order. It took even a lot longer to get the check in the end. We ordered the quesadilla as a starter-it was weird...tasted like they used too much and too \"fake\" cheese...Than we had a combination fajita-the portion was big, but no flavor-we also got 3 pieces of tortillas with it. I did not like the desert- too \"eggy\"- we ordered the flan. Overall...unfortunate that such a beautiful location does not offer better food....and the service is just mediocre,not sure I will go back."}
{"text":"Overpriced! We ordered tacos, my husband had the chicken and I had the fish. You get three size of your palm tacos.  The fish was pretty good but my husband really didn't like the chicken. Definitely don't care for corn tortillas. They should give options corn or flour. Rice wasn't good at all. Maybe it's some people's taste but we didn't care to spend that much money on something that wasn't very good and very tiny amount.  We won't be back. If you like to throw your money away then you can try it and see if it's your style."}
{"text":"Went there again this week and had a great meal and great service. This place is definitely a step up from tacos and burritos and it is worth it."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. A very unimaginative menu with fair at best food"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner and I think it's great.   For the dinner service we make online reservations ahead which turned out to be awesome. The non-reservations people that walked in ahead of us waited nearly 30 minutes for a table on a busy Friday night. Suckers. Anyway, the tableside guacamole was really good, the margaritas were good, and the enchiladas were tasty. I like that there are vegetarian options for the enchiladas that don't just include cheese, sauce and tortilla.   When we went for lunch the food was just as great, but the service was a bit slower. Some diners got really fast service and were in and out, others (like us) had to wait a little longer at each step of the process making a working day lunch a bit too long.   Other than the slower lunch service, I'd recommend this as a solid Mexican food option in this city."}
{"text":"Delicious salsa and super tasty steak tacos! Service is a little slow though. The atmosphere in this restaurant rocks and I host business lunches here regularly."}
{"text":"Thought I'd order Ceviche.  I hadn't had it in awhile, love it, and it was a warm day. They must have served me yesterdays because it was so terribly \"over limed\". Very disappointed.  The free guacamole coupon we got at the resort was very good and they made it tableside.  The waiter was great!"}
{"text":"The building is beautiful, the food is good, the service is a little slow, and it can be very busy, but overall, a good restaraunt. Again, the building is stunning."}
{"text":"What can I say, Great food and great Margarita's...The atmosphere is fun, and lively - the wait staff is excellent (not a bunch of summer kids filling time) but a professional staff. The bar is medium size and elegant looking - and they have 5 nice tall large round table in the bar so you can dine there as well. The main restaurant area is just as elegant as the bar area. We usually sit and eat in the bar areas of most restaurants.  The food is always good and the kitchens fast on getting food out.  If you like Guacamole, this is the place to get it - they make it fresh right at your table.. and the chips are always crisp.  If you are looking for the Typical \"chain Mexican food type restaurant\", then this is not the place to go.  The food is Mexican, but with style and flair... Different but great."}
{"text":"Seriously good Mexican food. I had the mole enchiladas which are one of the best things I've eaten in a long time.  The fish tacos were also ridiculously good. Wish I could have eaten more!  Service was solid too.  The only reason it's not five stars is because it is a bit pricey, but the atmosphere is a bit nicer than your average Mexican restaurant, so I understand why I guess."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 4.5 stars, not only because the food and service were both excellent, but because I'm very excited that there is finally a decent Mexican restaurant in Summerlin. I had the fish tacos and my girlfriend had the cheese enchiladas (which inexplicably comes with chile con carne on top - she opted for the delicious but spicy tomatillo sauce instead). My tacos were flavorful and juicy, and they were grilled, not fried, which I loved. The picked onions on top were yum yum.  Complimentary chips were light and crunchy and the salsas were tasty. We each had a margarita which were made with fresh squeezed juices and a VERY healthy pour of tequila. Hopefully they keep this up! I thought the room and bar area were lovely and understated, with plenty of natural light.  Our server (Cesar) was great - we got lots of attention and copious drink refills. Overall, lunch was a big thumbs-up.....we will certainly be back to try other menu items and take advantage of the happy hour margaritas..."}
{"text":"Service south of the border. We have been strong supporters for Cantina Laredo, referring all our friends to try it out. Service has always been very good. Until tonight. We arrived, sat at the Bar and asked what the Happy Hour specials were. After being told that the Merlot and Cab were $4.00 I ordered the Merlot.  We relocated to a table across from the Bar so another couple who we invited could join us..  We asked the server before ordering anything if she would split the check because we were ordering dinner and our friends were just having Apps and drinks.  We were told no problem. So far so good. We then got a different server who had a attitude and was not a people person.  Drinks took excessively a long time to get. I ordered Fortaleza Blanco tequila, Neat. The server forgot what i asked for so i repeated what i wanted and he repeated what i requested, then he was going to give me the wrong tequila that I ordered even after repeating my request for what I asked for. The check came and we were charged $9.50 for glasses of wine instead of the $4.00 happy hour charge, When the bill came, it was bundled together instead of split and the server got a new attitude when I told him I had asked the 1st server to split the check.  Our friends were very upset and vowed to never return. Not a happy camper. Vegas has 1000's of places to dine and if customers are treated properly resturants go as fast as they come. I hope Cantina Laredo improves."}
{"text":"Awesome place. The food is delicious. The customer service is perfect. The manager Mark always makes sure that his customers are happy and taken care of.  I recommend this place to everyone because I am so impressed with the experience."}
{"text":"One iced tea, one bowl of guacamole, one sampler appetizer............$37 with tip!  I can't see myself going back to this place. WAY too expensive for mediocre Mexican food. The guacamole made table side was good but certainly not the best I have ever tasted. I did love the complimentary chips and salsa but unfortunately it was the highlight of the meal. Everything on the sampler was just OK.  We really wanted to love this place. It would be great to have an upscale Mexican place close to home but this place was certainly not worth the price( I don't mind spending a lot of money for something if it is good).  The decor was nice and our wait staff was fantastic with great service from our waitress but what a Let Down in all other aspects."}
{"text":"We want to like this place!  We have been 6 or 7 times, but it seems to get progressively worse.  Our first visit was wonderful and the food was delicious.  We hoped our next visits were with the 'B' chef.  We went again last night with our kids and spent a lot of money on very average food.  The service is always top notch.  They  need a new chef."}
{"text":"Este Restaurante está increíble, acogedor e higiénico...especialmente el mesero, un 10/10 por ser Atento... The Service is great, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Chicken Fajita was fair, Chicken Enchilada was below par.  Very plain.   Only chicken inside of tortilla covered with a white cheese sauce and rice on the side.   Very plain ambience.   Looks nothing like a Mexican restaurant.   The server took away our dirty dishes,  chips and salsa while we were still eating.   I'll never go again."}
{"text":"Delicious! Each person in my group of 4 left happy and satisfied with our meal choice. Not the most authenic Mexican food, but very fresh and unique. Strong and tasty margaritas!  Warm welcoming serivice and decor. Comfortable and spacious seating in the dinning area and bar. Very pleased with my experiance!"}
{"text":"I'm in my mid 50s and I have not tasted better guacamole in my life, not to mention the apple pie! Well, ok. Lets talk about the apple pie. It's homemade here in the restaurant every day. It has a wonderful blend of flavors incorporating sweet and tart, cinnamony and citrousy. It's covered with a generous portion of cinnamon ice cream and then drowned in a hot bubbly buttery brandy sauce.  The vegetables they serve with their dishes are fresh, and I can actually taste the veggie! -each has it's own distinct signature of flavor.  Jose was our server. I have to say, the service was prompt, personable, friendly and proficient and honest. REFRESHING!  I will definitely be back and  I can't wait to share this place with my friends and family."}
{"text":"Visited Cantina Laredo for the second time. Food was great! Our server Eric was awesome! Again, I had my Top Shelf Guacamole and my delicious Carne Asada...  Casa Rita Margarita was also fantastic!!! I guess I got addicted to this restaurant. Quality is something that really matters to me and they have it all! Thank you, Cantina Laredo Staff for great food and service, even in a busy night... See you soon!"}
{"text":"I took the wife here on date night and it was terrible. The food was mediocre to poor. The order was wrong. The portions were tiny. This place has pretensions of being haute or highbrow Mexican. The prices reflect that, but the food does not. The service was snarky and slow. They gave us a comp card for chile con queso for our trouble. Fact is, we will never go back. We will wait for this place to shut down and hope for a better replacement."}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo is pretty big and even though it is popular, the majority of the times that I have eaten there I haven't had to wait for a table.  However, they do have a large bar so if you do have to wait that would be a good way to drink the time away.  I nearly always opt for the guacamole appetizer.  There is no way to complain about guacamole that is made tableside.  If you don't like cilantro - tell the friendly staff not to include it in this awesome dish.  If you're sensitive to heat they'll leave the jalapenos out for you too.  However, I like my food really spicy so I make sure that I get all of the jalapenos that are available.  When it's all said and done, this guacamole is good.  It's just good.  In addition to the guacamole I am also a big fan of the Monterrey enchiladas.  The mole sauce adds some variety, and the spinach enchilada helps me fool myself into believing that I am eating healthy.    The wait staff has also been consistently friendly.  When I have eaten here the food has come out quickly, and my drinks are regularly topped off."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food in a very non traditional setting. Modern decor no hint of a Mexican theme anywhere in the restaurant. Food was excellent and presented a lot fancier than you typically see. Also more expensive than standard Mexican restaurant fare. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Just had lunch with a client, great chicken fajita quesadlla, diplayed nicely with fresh guacamole, beef taco's, black beans. Had a nice waiter, Ryan, made great suggestions on the skinny margarita, which was excellent. Sat on the side patio enjoying Tivoli Village. Such a relaxing space to enjoy along with the food."}
{"text":"We visited Cantina Laredo on a Friday evening.  The six of us had a great time.  Our party consisted of 4 adults and two children.  The wait for a table was 5-7 minutes for the patio.  The host staff was very polite.    Our server, Jose, was fantastic! He was very attentive, without being over-bearing.     The chips were thin, crispy and just enough salt.  They were served with hot and mild salsas, the charred tomatoes and peppers made the salsa great!   The food was really good.  We all sampled each others plates and were very pleased with all of our choices, Cheviche, Durnago plate, Camarones Escondidos, Spinach Enchiladas and of course chicken tenders for the kids.    The patio was perfect!  It was so relaxing our 5 yr old fell asleep before we left.    Our only regret, we were too full to try any of the desserts they had to offer."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. I accidentally ordered the wrong entree and even though I was ok with my mistake the staff insisted they would fix it. I really appreciate their offer."}
{"text":"As Sarah pointed out , the chips and salsa are worth coming here. The food itself is good , not amazing but good - I tried one of their combination platters. The staff here are friendly and the service is really good. They have a great bar though and a nice variety of Margaritas. I would say the bar is the best part of this restaurant.They have a nice happy hour with $5 margaritas."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food and a great happy hour in an awesome modern atmosphere. I've been coming here from about a year and every time I do the food is great. They take classics Mexican cuisine and put a modern twist on it to make it fresh and pleasing.  Plus the chef visits the tables to insure everything was great tasting."}
{"text":"I'm giving them two stars because the food was decently good. Having said that, all else is pretty negative. Sat outside on a sunny Thursday, was one of less than 10 tables in the restaurant. Host was nice and inviting, server was slow and lazy. I ordered an ice tea and was finally given it in a dirty glass after I had to ask again for it 20 min later. That was when we finally saw the server again. Silverware and plates dirty, my wife's water glass had food particles floating in it upon delivery. We won't be back even if the food was ok, I hope the health department goes in there and gets them to clean up their act."}
{"text":"Food is good here.  Service is good as well.  Nothing great or special, nothing bad. Fairly average Mexican joint."}
{"text":"*****HAPPY HOUR REVIEW ONLY*****  My friend and I were happy hour hopping in Tivoli and decided to come in and try their happy hour specials (starts at 4pm). It is definitely a beautiful restaurant with pretty outdoor seating. We obviously sat in the bar at the high top tables and all of their bar plates were half off. They provided complimentary chips and salsa, which was SUPER SUPER GOOD!! The chips were so light and airy since the were crispy instead of crunchy like regular salsa chips. They gave you two different salsas and my favorite was the darker hued one (sorry I don't know the name) It Was even better with guacamole to thicken it.   We ordered the Ahi tuna tacos for $4.50, the flat bread \"de camarones\" (shrimp, pineapple, goat cheese, and bbq chipotle sauce) for $5.50, and the crab cakes for $5.50. Everything came out 3-5 minutes later (which could also be a bad sign). My favorite was the shrimp flat bread! The twist with pineapple, goat cheese, and bbq sauce was AMAZING! Definitely a staple dish that I will always order! Unfortunately, it was the only great dish out of the three. The tuna tacos were underwhelming because the tuna had no seasoned flavor. It was very watery versus being juicy. The guacamole that came with it was not as flavorful as it should be either, so we mixed it with the salsa. I may try it again just to see if we caught it on a bad day or I will try the mahi mahi tacos next time.  The most unsatisfying, disappointing, unappetizing dish was the CRAB CAKES!! Simply the worst!!!! We couldn't even finish them and it was only three! The cake batter was mushy in the inside and hard on the outside. It had that OLD frying grease taste and the crab pretty much sucked. I will not be giving this dish a second chance. It was just too horrible and NOT WORTH $5.50 (Originally $11!!!). It wasn't even worth the price of a item on a fast food dollar menu. And only three cakes at that! Never again! At least the tuna seemed like it had potential to be saved, but the crab cakes were just hopeless and overpriced for what you get!  Service was good, but not overly amazing. She gave us to-go bags for the chips. Yes, they were THAT GOOD!   Overall I will go back to order off their happy hour menu. The four star rating is for the flatbread, wine (the Riesling was quite good and I love their wine glasses), complimentary chips & salsa, service, and the ambiance/decor (even though half our dishes were not appealing thus minus one star). I like the ambiance both inside and outside. I will return, but I want to try more dishes before I say it's a hit! As of now it is worth stopping by for a drink and bar appetizers out of all the restaurants, including Brio. The complimentary chips and salsa will fill you up if you only enjoy one dish. They are not stingy with chips and salsa! If your frequent to Brios happy hour, try this place and get the shrimp flatbread and others. But PASS ON THE CRAB CAKES unless you feel lucky."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting And I did enjoy it, But the first time I went the food was stunning, crafted well,  and tasted amazing. This time the food was a tad over seasoned,  which was disappointing."}
{"text":"Nice ambience, high quality for a chain and the prices do reflect that. The menu items are clearly marked in terms of vegan or gluten free, I liked that. The service was a bit slow and mechanical but not unacceptable."}
{"text":"Always a great experience! Not sure how they rounded up their staff but every time we are there our service is on point and the food amazing. Not to mention their salsa is addicting"}
{"text":"I have to laugh at some of these reviews..Some must be suspect..I go here at least twice a week..The food is delicious..never had a bad meal here. The drinks are great and service is always friendly and prompt...The patio is beautiful at night....you cant go wrong for dinner here.."}
{"text":"Always easy to get a table. Staff is super friendly.  I love the enchiladas de mole, which I consistently order at least once a week. Recently I tried the mango chicken salad and it was absolutely amazing. Definitely go here!"}
{"text":"Love the food here . Eric & Lilly are my favorite they're always nice and accommodating"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience.  Great drinks, great food and the best is LIsa!!!  She is a breath of fresh air.  We had a Groupon (fantastic savings) and enjoyed everything - from the table side fresh made guacamole to the Mexican apple pie and everything in between.  (including yummy Sangria and mojitos)"}
{"text":"So, I had there \"Tacos De Pollo Cascabel, Ceviche, Tacos De Barbacoa, Flautas, Nachos Al Carbon and Crab Cakes\"  Over all the food was Ok, nothing amazing but ok there's stuff that I would not order again but I couple that I might. The atmosphere and the services was real nice. There was nothing that stood out that makes me wanna come back to try it again so as far as coming back I might if I'm in the area for Happy Hour but I will not go out my way to come back"}
{"text":"I am in town from Portland. Had the urge for Mexican and this place was recommended. The recommendation was spot on. The chips and salsa were outstanding. The guacamole was smooth and tasty. The margaritas were probably the best I have ever had, from a taste perspective. The tortilla soup was awesome, as was the  mango salad. All around great experience. I will definitely be back the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"We're regulars here especially for the table side guacamole. Food is great, service is above average (fantastic if Jessica is your server). The glaring weakness with this place is there salsa (worst salsa in Las Vegas). We've actually decided to not go here sometimes because of that. Menu winners- Carnitas, Fajitas trio, Carne asada. Menu losers- Fish tacos, quesodillas, flour tortillas in general."}
{"text":"I have been there twice. The food is OK, pricey for Mexican though. The drinks are good. The service is ok too. The first time the service was better, but the second time not so good at all. We were mostly ignored!!! Although it could have been because of my friend's kid!!  You can find better Mexican restaurant for cheaper, but the location is convenient being it is in the shopping center and all."}
{"text":"Tommy checking back in.  We did decide to go ahead and brave another visit, this time sitting in Mo's section.  WAY better.  Just goes to show you what a difference good service makes!  I'd go back...that is until Mo moves on.  Hope she stays a while.  And there's no beating that made at your table guacamole.  Save room for the amazing brownie that comes out on a sizzling skillet with some sort of bubbling delight of a sauce.  Can't be more specific as my table mates scarfed it down before I got more than one bite in."}
{"text":"I called a week and a half in advance to make a reservation at 6:30p and didn't get seated until almost an hour later! Every 10 min they said \"5 more minutes\". Finally we got seated.  I ordered Chicken Enchiladas and a Pina Colada. Both were so very delicious, I was very impressed. We also had the fresh made guacamole...and it was one of thee best guacamoles I've ever tasted!  Our Server was Eric H. and he was exceptional! He made up for the service as a whole.   I plan on going back :)"}
{"text":"New in town and we had a terrible experience here...from beginning to end.  Nice setting and the bar looked fun but loud and right in the middle of the restaurant.  After a reasonable wait, the hostess decided to offer us the seats right next to the door - which had been open the entire time we and others were waiting but went unoffered for obvious reasons.  We asked for a different table.  The hostess, very perturbed by this (I think she even sneered), did reluctantly take us in the back next to a very obnoxious table of women who were literally yelling across the table at each other. No one ever asked them to keep it down. They ruined the atmosphere for the entire back room.  Our waitress was nice and quite good. But margaritas - no thanks - and the food sounded good but was disappointing.  All and all, never going back."}
{"text":"Its all about the experience! Ask for Kris. She is the best! Don't forget to treat her well if she makes your night."}
{"text":"We always come back to this place because of the good food. But tonight the service was exceptional. I never had to ask for a refill on my drink or chips and salsa. The guacamole is fantastic! Also the Mexican apple pie... It is delicious. Highly recommend this place to anyone wanting good food, great service and not a long wait."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots! Service is kind of slow, but the delicious food always makes up for it! My boyfriend and I always start with table side guac and the ahi tuna tacos. For our entrees, I enjoyed the crab enchiladas and my bf the Chilean sea bass. The Mexican apple pie is a MUST HAVE! Overall, I say go!"}
{"text":"This is a personal favorite of mine in Summerlin.  It's really good Mexican-style food and the service, in my experience, has been incredible.  The guacamole is a personal favorite (rally fresh and prepared at your table).  They prepare seafood REALLY well.  I have tried several different dishes and always been delighted with my selection.  Also, I think their apple pie might be the best I have ever had....yeah I know it's a Mexican restaurant serving a traditional American dessert, but they do it up right.  Don't judge, just try.  Overall, I love the location (Tivoli Village in Summerlin) and have always left the restaurant happy I ate there (and of course that I saved room for apple pie)."}
{"text":"Amazing everyone and everything was just Amazing! ! Lilly was the best server I have ever had very sweet!  Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good late night happy hour and stumbled upon this place. It was excellent. Our bartender, Juan, was very attentive. When he wasn't helping guests he was tending to his very tidy bar. Happy prices were great and the quality of bar food far exceeded our expectations. We will return!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this a 4 and not 5 is because the margaritas that I ordered were VERY weak. The food was excellent! Dessert was out of this world. My husband had red wine as usual and said it was very good. I ordered a margarita which was 12.75 but it was during \"happy hour\" time so I'm not sure if they were pouring light for those Drinks and ended up pouring light for mine. Just a warning because when I pay that much for a margarita I expect to taste tequila. The food however was the freshest and best Mexican food we have ever had."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas! Mexican is my favorite style of food and the modernized menu here is mouth watering. I have brought just about all of my family and friends and not one disappointed tummy yet. It is reasonably priced and has an interesting vibe."}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo is a nice mexican restaurant.  If you like super salty chips you'll love these chips.  There are two different types of salsa, a cold and a hot.  The hot salsa has a smokier, spicier flavor than the cold.  Both are really tasty.  I ordered the chicken enchiladas with sour cream poblano sauce.  They were ok at best.  The chicken had no flavor and the sauce was kind of bland.  The pinto beans were really good and the spanish rice was average.  My husband had the carnitas.  The meat was super tender and fell off bone.  He ordered a side of flour tortillas so he could make tacos with the meat.  He had a side of mixed vegetables that consisted of zucchini, red peppers and squash.  He said that they were seasoned perfectly, and he doesn't even like zucchini.  He also had a side of rice and a margarita.  All and all the meal was good and relatively cheap at only $45."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch in a relaxed and casual environment. Surprisingly great chips and limey-salsa offered on the table. Will return."}
{"text":"Nice to have healthy food choices at a Mexican Restaurant. Great ahi tuna tacos. Especially at the happy hour prices!"}
{"text":"Wow! Guacamole tableside was amazing! The carne wrapped chilie ralleno was tasty and the apple pie was to die for! Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I read something about this place in one the local weekly newspapers and recommended it to some friends who were taking me to a birthday lunch.  The space was well done but like most of these places, the actual food was just okay.  Of course, being a Mexican restaurant, I was expecting Viva Michoacan  or Lindo Michoacan (ha! I never noticed they had about the same name.) The food here was okay, but v.small portions and not much to them. And like other reviewers, the server seems to really want us to drink their expensive booze.  I'm not a drinker so that gets annoying, Again, this is not a place that I will special effort to go here again."}
{"text":"Great guacamole!!! Sign up for Club Catina before you go and you will get a 10.00 free guacamole made table side! We had the fajitas, fish tacos, and nachos... Very good! Their house margaritas were awesome"}
{"text":"opened 5 min late. let us sit another 15. then seated another table right next to us and took their order and never acknowledged us. We finally just got up and left."}
{"text":"Down.  Right.  AMAZING!  Having grown up in Seattle, good Mexican food is few and far between, but cantina laredo has opened my eyes to a whole new culinary world!  The service was superb, and the food was even better!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food in an upscale modern setting. Service was excellent although prices are a bit higher than usual for Mexican restaurants. Highly recommended for a different type of Mexican restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Dine in at their patio and it was kinda relaxing for you can feel the breeze and it was really a nice place to have a dinner. I ordered grilled chicken with some mango mole sauce but it tasted different though. It was good but I couldn't really figure it out if it was chicken or lamb lol. It probably be because of the mango mole sauce that made it taste like a lamb. I'm giving it a 4 star only because our server was kinda slow. Fall asleep again waiting for our cheques to come."}
{"text":"The past three times I've been here has been very disappointing. My meal has been wrong on each occasion. The bartenders working didn't seem to really care and want to make it right. I felt like I was bothering them to get their attention. I never had a manager come to talk to me about making the meal right. I will never come back again.."}
{"text":"Try the Seabass.  You won't be disappointed.  The rest is well...just like the rest."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great margaritas. Sorry that's all I have time for. You'll have to trust me."}
{"text":"\"The guac is fantastic, loved my entire meal. Totally enjoyed the outside dining. The service was great.  Will definitely be back!\""}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars. Came in on a Sunday at 830 about 6 staff members looked or way, however we were never greeted or seated for over 10 min. Restaurant was mostly empty about 25 people so they were not busy. Once we were seated it took another 10 min just for water and silverware. Area we were seated in was very dirty with food all over the floor.  Entire meal we never had our water refilled or more chips. Very disappointed as I have been to other Cantina Laredo's and had wonderful service. This was horrible in even more disappointed that this happened in Scottsdale. Do not come here!!!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour and service on this visit! Chips and salsa and guacamole as well as the desserts are to die for!"}
{"text":"Well we tried this restaurant for the first time, via take out. So my experience is solely on the food we ate (to go). I was on the hunt for a restaurant with Mole Chicken and after contacting 8 other Mexican restaurants that didn't have it on the menu I was thrilled to hear Cantina Laredo did! We ordered Chicken Mole Enchiladas and Mango Mole Chicken entree, Flan for desert. The Mole sauce and the Mango sauce was good but the major downfall was how dry (perhaps overcooked) the chicken was. I think this restaurant has good potential and the right ingredients but lacks in execution. The tortilla used for the Enchiladas was like cardboard and even thought i did bring up the other reviews i read here regarding dry chicken I asked the person taking our order to pay attn to that. I was hoping it was a hit/miss situation. The Flan was Delicious! We also had a kids meal of 3 mini tacos...my son wasn't a fan so i rather not comment on that. In all I would like to return but baised on the reviews and my personal experience I don't think i'll be ordering the Enchiladas again. For the price point I don't think the value or quality was there, Sadly."}
{"text":"Always came here for happy hour especially after a hard days work... Foods good' drinks are great... But the pass 2times we came, it was a let down... 1time... Busy happy hour but the hostess didn't look like she really wanted to help us, so off to Brio we went (great HH too) and now it's cinco de mayo it's 4:30p and busy but still no urgency from a hostess to try and accommodate you, and when we sat in the dinning side the waiter didn't feel accommodating when we said, we're just going to have drinks and get food at the tamale bar... May be the last time we walk in this place... Too bad, I have a big mouth and at the end of the day, customer service is everything to me..."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant three times now. I instantly fell in love the first time because it's hard to find a more modern, upscale style of Mexican restaurant anywhere these days. The first time I ordered these amazing shrimp enchiladas. They were flavorful and covered in this light creamy poblano sauce. YUM!   The second and third times, the food has just faltered. The chicken mole enchiladas were not that great. The sauce was delicious but unfortunately inside was just plain, dry shredded chicken. It wouldn't been nice for the chicken to have some flavor and not just rely on the mole sauce just on top of the enchiladas.   Another miss were the spinach enchiladas. I think it had the same creamy sauce as the shrimp enchiladas and that was tasty. But again, the spinach filling was completely unseasoned. It was basically just spinach that tasted as if they thawed some frozen spinach and through it in the enchilada - not even any salt! Due to the lack of seasoning, it actually had that overcooked muddy taste that spinach can develop when treated improperly.   I really want to be a fan because their menu and dining room are great, but maybe I'm just hoping it will be something it's not. Sorta like a bad relationship. =)"}
{"text":"Always time and money well spent. I've eaten here at least a dozen times and each time, the food is delicious and the service is excellent. Every time I've visited manager has stooped by the table to make sure everything is fine. The chips and salsa are excellent and each entree I've tried was great. Just has the fajita tacos last nite: highly recommend them. For Mexican food, one of my all time favorite stops."}
{"text":"First the chips were good but the warm red salsa was weird and tasted more like tomatoes than anything else (a common theme) chimichanga, the chicken inside had a nice smoky flavor and was seasoned well. The sauce on top was tomato paste with a Lil chipotle, not great almost Italian pasta sauce, the refried beans were horribly lacking in flavor/salt and the rice was awful. If you've never had the Knorr bag Spanish rice go here and try it. Or buy it at Fry's for $1. My wife had the street tacos which would've been good except for the \"pico de onion\" they cover it with. They graciously replaced it with a basic bean and cheese burrito, and a side of the bag rice from Fry's, yay, again the beans were bland. When the bill came they didn't charge us for the street tacos $11.99, instead they charged us $10.99 for a burrito the size of a frozen burrito again from Fry's and a side of the bag rice from Fry's as well. The waiter was very nice though.  For the price they want you to pay they sure don't delivery that quality. We could've gone to taco bell and gotten a better burrito."}
{"text":"Cute little place in Tivoli Village next to Boca Park.  They have an amazing happy hour and everything we've had there has been great.  It's a little spendy if you don't go for happy hour, but otherwise the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"Great food - great service.  Love the new Asada lunch - my new fav!!"}
{"text":"Really casual place I find it very unique that they make the guacamole is made right in front of you, you can even taste how fresh it is. The tacos are amazing along with the ribs. There is a lot of space so there is not that much waiting time"}
{"text":"We stopped in for happy hour.   Within walking distance from the suncoast casino on a nice day.   Fabulous food, reasonably priced (considering half off) and our server Kelly was excellent.   We tried the standard Margarita on the rocks,  mango and strawberry margaritas.  I usually prefer a standard (theirs is top shelf), but the fresh strawberry flavor made it my winner here.     For appetizers we shared three tacos and the flatbed.   It was fantastic!!!!"}
{"text":"My 1 star indicates the terrible service we received on my recent visit. We were lucky to snag a spot at the bar, and while it was busy, it was very normal for a Thursday night. In particular, Eduardo, was not only unhelpful, but blatantly rude one more than one occasion. He actually \"shooed\" me away when I politely raised my finger for a glass of wine, then proceeded to add to my existing glass(with wine still in it) when I asked for another glass and then urged me to hurry and hand him the glass so he could get my \"half-pour\" in and help other guests. I watched him the rest of our stay and he looked miserable and rushed. Word of advice: hire a new bartender!  So rude!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night. No wait getting in. Great staff! Amazing food. Two types of salsa were provided and both were great!  Our group all had different dishes and everyone loved what they got. We will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, clean/open floor plan.  The food is better than your run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurant. Ingredients are high quality, preparation/presentation is excellent, and the portion sizes are pretty big.  My favorite app is the Queso Blanco (with artichokes and poblanos) and my favorite entrée is the Asada y Enchilada!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place! Best LUNCH! Best DINNER! & even BEST BRUNCH!!! Try every single thing! Tacos, Ceviche and brunch are my FAVS!"}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo is a fabulous addition to the dining scene in West Las Vegas. As a girl who could eat chips & salsa for dinner every night and be happy - upscale Mexican food is a welcomed addition in Las Vegas. I just can't wait for the weather to turn nice so I can dine on their two patios - their fire pits and an indoor/outdoor bar are going to be a hit this spring.  I have grabbed lunch here a couple times and the food has been wonderful on each visit. Upon arrival they ask if you'd like to try their signature Top Shelf Guacamole. It's a fresh, delish way to start your meal.  They roll a cart to your table and then prepare made-to-order guac. You can't go wrong with that.  As for the menu as a whole, it is diverse and a lot lighter than typical Mexican fare. You won't leave feeling like you ate a huge greasy meal, but rather a nice sensible lunch. Over my visits I have tried the Mini Ahi Tacos (my favorite!), the Queso Fundido, Pollo Chipotle and their signature dish Enchiladas Vera Cruz. All the dishes delighted. I will be back for sure.  I took a peek at their Happy Hour menu and it looks pretty fun and reasonably priced. They even have Ladies' Night on Thursday with half-priced drinks.  I have yet to check it out, but it's on the to-do list for sure!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant! Fernando was awesome! He was our waiter bartender and entertainer! Cabo Flip Margaritas were delicious,  rellenos camarones tasty and flan was yummy! We are visiting from SD and will definitely come back here next time!"}
{"text":"Gltuen Free Review - Yes, their menu has marked the gluten free options. But that is far as it goes. The server or manager knew nothing about serving a gluten free meal that is free from cross contact for those of use who suffer from Celiac.  We tried Cantina Laredo in Scottsdale 3 times now. All during off hours when they were not busy. The first time I got sick, the \"gluten free fajitas\" came with flour tortillas. We sent them back. They gave us corn tortillas but I still got sick. We tried again 2 months later. This time we asked for a manager and explained our concerns about cross contact with gluten. Our server and manager got it right, and I did not get sick1 We were very happy! So, we went again 2 weeks later with my daughter who has Celiac. We again went off times. We explained our \"allergy\" to gluten was severe, and asked if they could take precauctions in the kitchen. Our server had no idea what Celiac was, and kept asking if we had a \"peanut\" allergery.  WE SHOULD OF LEFT. But no, I asked for the manager. HE WAS VERY RUDE. We explained the need for things to be gf and asked if they could do everything they could to prevent cross contact. He did nothing to assure us that the kitchen staff would do anything except give us corn tortillas with the fajitas.  Well, we ate anyway.(my mistake. I was hoping it would of been as good as last time) There was only one other couple in the restuarnat when we were there. It was very slow.  I was hoping they could take the time in the back to prepare our meal safely. THEY DID NOT. My daughter and I were both extremly ill after our meal. We will not be going back.  Yes, they have their gluten free options listed right on the main menu which is nice, but they do not take cross contact seriously. We gave them 3 chances.  2 times I was sick.  The sad thing is there food was good. I love good Mexican food. We drove 30 minutes to get to the Cantina Laredo in Scottsdale.  Never again."}
{"text":"I don't like to submit negative reviews but after giving this restaurant at least 6 tries I will never return. The other reviews are accurate about the food being average but on my last visit it was well below average. The chicken enchiladas were dry and cold. I asked for some additional sauce and it too was cold. Not as cold as the waitress though who only smiled when she handed us the bill.   The best part of this restaurant is the location and the guacamole they make at the table. Otherwise, I would have only given it one star."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant in town ever! I love the fajitas steaks how they serve it sizzling to your table and it tastes amazing! Fish tacos is my second favorite dish! Service is absolutely very good! Every thing in this restaurant is 5 stars!"}
{"text":"So glad we stopped in to try this place this weekend.  The margaritas are delicious. The warm salsa they served was very good as was the table side guacamole.  The entrees were just the right size for us.  Not your typical oversized meal covered in cheese.  The fajitas and tacos were great! Cant wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"The worst thing that can happen to a restaurant is exactly what is happening here. Great! Sucks! Great! Sucks! We decided to try. Saturday afternoon. Went right to the bar for drinks and food. Got the water. 10 minutes later. Ordered drinks. No menu. Nothing.  10 minutes later. First drink. This is a text book case of poor management.  One bartender to service the restaurant AND the bar. Did not get a chance to try the food. A girl came by and dropped off chips and salsa. No napkins, No plates nothing. We were hungry. $23 for 2 drinks. Asked the roving manager for the check. Glad I had cash because we would still be there waiting. We walked over to Brio. Wife was very disappointed. She really wanted Mexican. Brio was on top of their game. Great service. Great bartenders. Great food. Great drinks. My personal recommendation? Try Laredo in 3 months if it is still there. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Lovely food. Lovely staff  Super friendly and great service.   I've never been disappointed here! The food is excellent and the people make it a great environment.   I will continue to come here on a regular basis due to the ambiance.   The margaritas are excellent and the happy hours are awesome!"}
{"text":"The ambiance of this restaurant is perfect for a romantic evening. It is not your traditional Mexican cuisine, rather a fusion restaurant. Their dishes are perfectly seasoned, and the presentation is impeccable. The servers are both patient and friendly. This is one of the finer, and more affordable, date spots for north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Definitely not street tacos. Beware when ordering through Postmates menu, is somewhat deceiving. Called and spoke with a server they said have to pick fajita taco on the Postmates menu in order to get street taco style. Kind of a bummer. Chips and salsa are bomb though"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots. Everything on the menu is good and the cocktails are also fantastic. My parents visited from CA for 4 days and made me take them there twice! Everything is seasoned perfectly"}
{"text":"Cool setting, Good service HORRIBLE FOOD. What a joke, the enchiladas tasted like chilli cheese fries. My Torta was on ciabatta bread & looked like it was from subway. We sent 1 plate back & they offered a free drink which they ended up charging on the bill. Sorry but I wont be returning to this \"American-Mexican\" Spot.."}
{"text":"The house margaritas here are the greatest margaritas in the world. They are quite possibly the greatest drink in the world. They are strong too. These will boogie woogie on your brain!"}
{"text":"I sat at the bar tonight. The bartenders are super attentive and quick to offer a drink and food menu.    The chips are served warm which I love. The bartender recommended 3 tacos. ( steak, chicken and pastor) I ate the steak.... But the other 2sat with one bite out. Way to BBQ!!!!! Ended up not eating. for a mexican restaurant the tacos tasted very americanized.    For a drink I went with the recommendation of a strawberry mojito. Gross !!!!!!!! Bar bistro has the best in town.    after the bartender saw that i ate only one taco, she quickly took the plate and tried to just drop the check.... really?????   i doubt i will return. they are quick to sell and be friendly and then just act rude."}
{"text":"I travel to Arizona often, and this is one of my favorite places to eat! The margaritas are phenomenal and the carnitas are the BEST ever!!!  I mean WOW!!  All the food, including the salsa, guacamole and chips, are incredible.  And though I rarely have dessert, their sizzling brownie (I forgot the name of it!!) is absolutely one of the best desserts I have ever had! Save some room for it! It is sooo worth it!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several time but this last time I was disappointed.  The table side guacamole used to be a favorite - this time it was tasteless.  We had to add salt to give it flavor.  The same without th the ceviche.  Truly a disappointment because it's usually really good. The service was great though."}
{"text":"Go there for the brunch.  It is amazing.  It comes with a bloody mary (maria) or a mimosa.  And the next one is at a reduced cost.  The food is amazing.  The table side guacamole is worth every penny."}
{"text":"My girls and I come to Cantinas for lunch often. The happy hour is the best and Carlos always makes our day with the best customer service and his beautiful smile."}
{"text":"I've visited at least 10 times now, its GREAT! Servers are super friendly, the zucchini side is amazing, the fresh table side made guac is spicy but tasty. We even had a birthday dinner for 9 on a Saturday night with very short notice and they accommodated beautifully. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas! The food in incredible, margaritas are delicious and the prices are fantastic. Best of all the service is spot on. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The area, Tivoli Village, is a nice atmosphere and upon walking in was greeted and seated. Our server, usually I remember...Adrian?, was very pleasant. We ordered the cantina roll as an appetizer. It wasn't as good as it sounded in the menu. It lacked flavor except for the chipotle aioli. We ordered three tacos each, six different altogether. I remember she got the barbacoa plus two others and they were gone pretty quick. She was hungry and said the barbacoa was the best. I got the fajitas, carnitas and chorizo con queso tacos. The chorizo was the best of the three, unfortunately I started with the fajitas taco which I really did not like. Something about the sour cream drizzle did not sit well.  I will give it another try soon and order some different things."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of having Sunday brunch with a friend here a few weeks ago! What a treat for my palette! To start off, they had chips with a few salsas to chose from, and the one that is served warm was so savory, love it!  We shared the guacamole, which was made fresh table side-guac lovers rejoice indeed! I had the crab cake eggs benedict, which was seductively wrapped in a unique chipotle wine hollandaise sauce, served with yummy potatoes, and fruit in a cinnamon and sugar hard shell tortilla bowl! Add a complimentary mimosa to boot, it was all awesome!  I look forward to a return visit to try some of their later day dining options for sure, and maybe a margarita!    Overall, I give it a 4 start rating, which is still pretty good!  The food speaks for itself!"}
{"text":"One of our favorites for Mexican food, the salad  we had was fresh and the portions were generous.  The service is friendly but not obnoxious. Four gold stars."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and really good food, only thing I didn't like was they served string beans as one of their sides  but only because I am not a huge fan of string beans and I guess didn't expect that in a Mex. Restaurant. Other then that I was very pleased my service was great! the food was delicious and it had a very nice ambiance!"}
{"text":"I had heard good reviews about this place, but went in with no expectations. The wait staff was not the friendliest but the food I had made up for it. Normally, I don't like reviewing food items since everyone's taste buds are different, but I have to brag about this chicken entree I ordered. It had the most delicious chipotle wine sauce (and I'm not a big fan of chipotle) but this was to die for!!! I'm not a big eater but I devoured it!! I've heard mediocre reviews on this place but I don't care."}
{"text":"Paid $10 for 1 scoop of guac!! Food was extremely average. Nothing special. Only reason 2 stars because our server was really nice."}
{"text":"If I were to recommend a Mexican Restaurant it would be this one. Great service, friendly staff and the food is really, really good. Their margaritas are yummy and you can choose a flavor (peach, watermelon, mango). Dinner for two with two entrees, two margaritas & a dessert averages about 40+ tip...100% worth it!"}
{"text":"Hours on THEIR website are wrong. Drove all the way there to be sent away because they were closing."}
{"text":"Good food, but not fantastic. If you're looking for ambiance then this tour place. If you're more about the food then its only mediocre. A bit pricey for the food, but not exorbitant. This was my third time here, this time I had chicken enchiladas to go (my first to go order here). Nothing really memorable, just decent food. Really can't go wrong with any dish, I would have rated 4 stars for dine in but 3 because the service at the bar getting my order wasn't so great."}
{"text":"My family was visiting from out of town for Mother's Day Weekend and we wanted to try a new restaruant that none of us had gone to before. The hostess seated the four us on the patio and presented us with 3 filthy menus.  They were covered in food and salsa.  When we requested clean menus the hostess retrieved the 3 dirty menus and brought us back 3 MORE DIRTY MENUS!!!  When our server Javier came to the table we told him about the menu situation and he seem less than bothered and never took care of the problem.  Luckily one of us had hand sanitizer with us and we proceeded to clean our own menus so we could order! While we were ordering the server seemed more interested in watching the people walk by the patio than on giving us his attention.  Food was pretty good.  Water glasses were never refilled.  Server did not check on us regularly.  One of the members in our party went into the restaurant to speak with a manager about the sub standard service. The server Javier saw us speaking with the manager and without finding out what our complaint was; WENT TO OUR TABLE AND CONFRONTED MY PARENTS WHO ARE VISITING FROM OUT OF TOWN AND SAID, 'WELL I HEAR YOU WEREN'T HAPPY?\"  The manager was very apologetic and comped our meal but we could not believe that the server confronted the table!  I have worked in Food and Beverage myself for years but have never experienced or observed such rudeness from a server.   Although the manager tried to recover us I will never return to the Cantina Loredo and I would suggest that anyone reading this to go spend their hard earned money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Yes, I also attended the soft opening.  Everyone there was excited and so friendly.  The actual grand opening is tomorrow so it will be interesting to see how they did.    We just had to try the guacamole made at the table - the guac-chick was awsome.  They give you all kinds of options while preparing it.  It was fantastic....needed a little salt for my taste but pretty darn good.  Chips light and crispy-homemade.  Salsa just ok.  For entrees we ordered a chicken salad, steak pablano pepper and pork tacos.  All delish!  The chicken salad was full of flavor.  The steak pablano pepper (not sure if that was what it was called) was great.  The pepper stuffed with cheese, shrimp, onions and mushrooms sandwiched by a thin steak.  Wow.  Really wow.  Yum.  The tacos were good and flavorfull too.  My daughter ordered the corn dog (haha-kids) which they served honey mustard with which I thought was weird. lol    The decor was very blah.  They sat us in the back facing a wall with nothing on it. Odd kind of ambiance.  Kadence was our waitress-she was fabulous!  Like I said everyone was fantastic-on their best behavior still learning everything and getting to know each other but seemed like a good future team. ;)  The best thing was the BROWNIE!  They said it takes SIX yes SIX hours to make!  What???  They prepare the brownie with some kind of cream sauce and ice cream on a skillet right at your table.  Unbelievable!  It sounded like alot of their desserts were specially made like that - at the table.  Very \"special\" kind of dessert.  I only planned to have a couple bites...uh yeah that didnt happen.  hahah  Bet you would say the same and change that thought.  3 stars because they are not opened yet.  We will have to try it one more time to see.  The prices seem a little high-well some on them.  Our bill would have been about $90 with a margarita and a glass of wine.  Its worth a shot at least once.   Not sure when we will be back but if we do I will update this review.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Wow my hubby and I just finished having brunch here...what a poor experience. First off we walked in right as they opened which isn't until 11 a.m We were seated but it took forever to get our order in and another 20 minutes for our food to arrive. I ordered the juevos Migas and it arrived undercooked with barely any eggs mind you there is bacon in there! Everyone working there seemed very unhappy with barely any smile on their face. How sad. There were only 3 tables but the waiter kept bringing the foods to the wrong tables. Last but no least we asked for our check and that as well took forever... I had to go inside to ask somebody to bring our check-in  Hope they get their act together or else we don't see this place lasting much longer."}
{"text":"When I called to place an order last night I was put on hold briefly, however, this time my call was actually answered!!!!  When I walked in, the one girl at the desk seemed somewhat awake!!!  Keep up the good work Cantina Laredo!  My queso and guac were delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Ammmmmmaaaazing Margs during happy hour! Half price appies are yummy and priced well. Make sure to save room for the skillet apple pie with cinnamon ice cream. Not a dessert person and gobbled this up. Being from Vancouver, we love patios and wished the happy hour area extended out to this but won't stop us from coming."}
{"text":"Bottom line: This was my first time in and I won't be back. I totally agree with \"Rebekah J\", and our experience with this place was not any different. We were not even given our silverware, and the waiter never came to us after taking our order. When I went in searching for one, no one bothered to care, and busy talking among themselves. Food was just ok, nothing great. All this when the overall occupancy was about 25%. This was my first time, and would be my last too!"}
{"text":"Table side guacamole and mani mahi tacos.  Great food and service.  Great location. Close to mini airport."}
{"text":"The hubs and I were on the hunt for lunch and both starving! We both get hangry, so food was a must asap! We found this place and since we had the pup, needed a patio. They obliged so we sat down.  Pros: $2 mimosas, good salsa, friendly servers, dog friendly patio Cons: Tiny portions for starving people, grenidine in mimosas and not very good food The $2 mimosas seemed great, but were pretty lame (you get what you pay for) and had my second least favorite substance in the world in it, grenidine.  The food came out pretty quick, but we were starving and my two tiny tacos and ramekin of beans left a lot to be desires. C ordered the huevos rancheros and they put fruit on his plate and the juice leaked on it eggs. Kind of gross. It was good enough, but I wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for lunch. He got the grilled salmon w/ chimi churri sauce w/ asparagus and rice. I got the chicken enchilada mole. Salmon was grilled perfectly and the enchiladas were very flavorful!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in town by far. Always great food, drink and friendly service. Every visitors we have from out of town we bring there to enjoy the great food!"}
{"text":"I haven't written a review on Yelp in a very long time but my experience last night at Cantina Laredo compelled me to get back on the yelp train, this time to warn others to stay far, far away from this place. I'll get the only positive thing out of the way: the restaurant décor and set up is nice. They also have a large outdoor dining area. We asked to sit outside and the hostess led us outside and handed us menus.   We sat for a good 15 minutes, watching the server walk by us a good 8-10 times, never acknowledging our presence or bothering to bring us chips and salsa (or water). When a different server came by with chips and waters, because we'd had 15 minutes to look over the menu, we also ordered: skinny margarita and patron margarita, both with salt, Combination Fajitas and Chili Rellano. Another 30 minutes passed, no refills on our empty water glasses, no drinks. I've never thought about just walking out of a restaurant before finishing a meal, but we came really close.   Finally, the server came out with our drinks. The BF told him, without any attitude, how long we'd been waiting without any service or more water. Server's response: the bartender is slow and he'd go check on our food. Couple minutes later, our Fajitas and Chili Rellano  were brought out. The BF pointed out our drinks had no salt as ordered. Server's response was, well, there really wasn't much of a response. It was some mumblings about the bartender. The server apologized and offered to bring us salt. We declined. The server clearly had no idea how to handle a well earned complaint about the service or the drinks. I'd suggest some proper training. Getting us new drinks, rather than offering to bring us salt, would have gone a long way. I use to work as server so I know something like that makes a big difference. But we got nothing.   On to the food. Fajita entree: My rice and tortillas were cold. Beans were luke warm. No sizzle on the fajita platter. The chicken and beef were barely hot but totally dry. The Chili Rellano: ths dish looked really, really good. The BF said it would have been good had it been hot. Obviously, our food was ready to go in the kitchen, probably a good 20 minutes before being served to us.   When the check came, and that's the only thing that came fast, I asked my boyfriend to refrain from leaving a tip. I have never not left a tip. Ever. But after last night, I see now why people sometimes don't. When spending $65 for dinner and drinks, we expect good food, good service, and some effort to remedy things that go awry. We will never go back to Cantina Laredo and I suggest you stay away."}
{"text":"Well ... it's time for our periodic \"let's-go-eat-someplace-that-isn't-the-Nest\" visit.  I had a lunch at Cantina Laredo one time when the Orchid visited her favorite retail establishments in Tivoli Village, and thought rather well of it, so we decided this would be this month's stop.  As it was when I visited solo, it was bright, cheery and looked a little trendy.  It was much noisier than I remembered, but (a) it was Friday night, (b) there was Olympic coverage on half of the TVs, and (c) there was pre-season American football on the OTHER half of the TVs.  So, we just gutted up and dealt with it.  When I was here last, I ordered what I THOUGHT I remembered as a chimichanga, so I asked for it again.  (Due to a food allergy, I asked for NO avocado or guacamole products in any of my food.)  The darling Orchid, with her food sensitivities, asked for the mildest sauces possible (NO heat if possible), and asked if pinto beans could be replaced with black beans.  (When I got the check at the end of the meal, I noticed that Eric, our server, had noted on the ticket \"FOOD ALLERGY -\" and the nature of our requests.  Nicely done, sir.)  The requests for modifications were honored, and pleasantly.  The food itself ... Orchid's appetizer, something they call \"Top Choice Guacamole\" - tableside preparation.  You can ask for customization ... add this, leave that out ... she loved it.  Her entree - an enchilada plate with avocado, something-else-starting-with-the-letter-\"A\" on a bed of spinach, was very much to her taste.  (When you go, it's the last item in the column of \"Enchiladas\" on the menu.)  My chimichanga was decidely not what I remembered, but it was on the lunch menu and not on the dinner menu, so either the dinner chef makes them differently or I just plain remembered wrong.  (At age 60, this is not beyond the realm of possibility.)  It wasn't bad, just not what I was expecting.  Will we be back?  Probably.  Will it be soon?  Maybe not.  There are too many other places we'd like to try.  -- -- -- -- --  On the Nighthawk 100-point scale: 76."}
{"text":"Burt wouldn't come back.  It wasn't completely horrible, but Burt won't be back.  The guacamole is excellent. The margaritas were very good. The problem was the entrées.  Tampico which was highly recommended,  was mediocre and lacked flavor. As did the chicken enchiladas and the mahi tacos. Very bland. Coffee was TERRIBLE. The apple pie dessert is great. The waiter was helpful and attentive.   So that's the problem. Apps and desert are wonderful. The entrees are boring and very expensive for Mexican.   But then again what did Burt expect from a Mexican food chain located in an Italian themed mall in Las Vegas?"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Cantina Laredo.  It's a bit pricey - we typically spend over $100 for drinks, dinner and guacamole - but the food is delish!"}
{"text":"A group of us tried this restaurant because we were \"craving\" Mexican food.  We were not disappointed, the service was good and we got a great table on their outside deck.  They also have great salsa, the first time I had heated salsa and it was great.  Also I would recommend anything on their taco and enchiladas menu."}
{"text":"This place is great. There are some reviews on here from a few years ago which makes me think that this place is either under new management or had a huge turn around. All statements about the chips and salsa are true (they are great) and that can be said for the margs too! My fiance and I go for the Happy Hour which is amazing. We love the crab cakes and tacos. The prices for the main entrees are a bit crazy for us, but the happy hour pricing is great. I would call this upscale tex-mex. Just thinking about Cantina Laredo has my mouth watering...guess its good we plan on going tonight."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food is good here - it's just a bit expensive for 'decent' Mexican food, particularly when you're in the Southwest.  Service was great and the restaurant itself is a nice place to dine and have drinks but I think you can find better Mexican if you try."}
{"text":"My lunch here was good.  I liked the table side guacamole and was glad they offered to bring additional spicy flavorings on the side so that the guacamole could be shared easily.  My pork tacos were tender and good, though nothing too exceptional.  The dessert tray with fake ice cream was a little creepy."}
{"text":"First of all the place has a nice feel. real open and plenty of seating, thats the only good thing about this place. The margaritas are made with too much tequila. they could make a whole lot more money on drinks if they didn't get so heavy handed on the tequila, people might order a second one. The chips were ok, the salsa was disappointing. The food is overpriced nothing gourmet about it. The waitress was sweet but not the most efficient. But the most frustrating issue was my husband had dropped his phone under the table unknowingly and  we left the restaurant to go to a casino. Mind you, we are visiting Scottsdale for a night since we are from Orange County CA. So we are use to great, reasonably priced Mexican fool. We came back an hour later, and the same people were still seated at the table. I asked if i could go search under the table and the hostess accompanied me to ask the people  but the customers just looked up at me and rudely ignored my request. REally?  If i was sitting there i would have gladly pushed my chair back to let them look for their phone. needless to say, we waited another 45 minutes for them to leave.  once they got up my husband walked over pulled the chair out, and the phone was under the table. Staff is inadequate, and the patrons snobs. i would not recommend this place to anyone. They give Scottsdale a bad name for customer service and Mexican food"}
{"text":"I love Cantina Laredo's margarita. Best ever. What I don't like about CL is their happy hour rules. I've gone there often to meet friends for happy hour, and sometimes we have 10 or more girls, but they are so strict about happy hour deals being in the bar only. Even when the dining room is completely empty. It just doesn't seem like a good business model and makes me not want to go there."}
{"text":"Had lunch today food was great, including chips and salsa.  Our waitress Claudia was very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Found in Arizona!!!  Really good Mexican food that is not a taco,burrito or enchilada!!!  We stopped for lunch at this mall restaurant not expecting much and it was a happy surprise. We ordered maragaritas and appetizers.  Spend the extra $$ and get the Cab0o Wabo margarita than the house one; it's worth it.  The 'ritas were clearly made from fresh ingredients, although I would have like mine a little sweeter.  We ate the delicious guacamole, which was made table-side, and the ceviche, whiich was probably the best I ever ate.  The chips and salsa that were brought to the table were also very freshly made. Our waiter was very capable.  The only downside was the hostess who seated us.  Not very friendly, never made eye contact and if she spoke at all, she mumbled."}
{"text":"My girl friend and I are huge fan of this place. we always love our experience here. This place is one of my favorite  spot for drinks and food.  Our server Jaclyn was friendly, attentive and thoroughly knowledgeable of menu. Food are great and the prices are fair..."}
{"text":"Awesome and amazing restaurant. The meat was so tender and juicy. Very friendly waitress and customer service was great"}
{"text":"Great Mexican menu with some interesting variations on the traditional meal. I enjoyed the bacon chicken fajita. It was superb. The meal of course begins with house chips. They served two options with the chips. I loved the fresh salsa. And it coupled well with the second option, a warm spicy dip. Service was fine. I love eating outdoors. The menu offers a nice beverage selection."}
{"text":"Salad was large and fresh, decent flavor.  Lots of other stuff to try.  Kind of a mid-scale Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I've had much, much better. I didn't care for the beans or rice. They tasted as if they came out of a can and a box. The tacos were OK. I got the ones with the brisket. The meat tasted OK. The service wasn't great. We had a waitress that was in such a hurry and seemed to be bothered when we asked her questions because she just had to go--a real turn off!"}
{"text":"Came here for drinks and guacamole as we saw good reviews on both. Our expeditions we're exceed 10 folds. Our server Lilly was amazing. Recommended our drinks and spent a great deal of time with us. I will be back (often)!"}
{"text":"Love Happy Hour here 11am-5pm on Saturday when most do not even offer it. Cold beer great margaritas and 1/2 price tacos. Oh I can not forget about Edwardo and Carlos. The best bartenders in town!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time there we were very happy I had the Guadalajara enchiladas delicious my friend had the fish tacos I will definitely go back great service nice ambiance good prices"}
{"text":"Definetely would go back. Very good: draft beer, margaritas, guacamole. The entrées & service were exceptional. This is the place to ask the server what they would recommend; I had a carne asada dish, wife had chicken. Don't know what \"regular\" Mexican food was like, although they had large selection. They had a lot of items I had never seen anywhere else.  Expensive, if you are looking for something more affordable, don't go here; you will miss the best dishes."}
{"text":"We are visitors to Az and this restaurant was recommended by a friend. We enjoyed the relaxing ambiance and friendly service. Our food was delicious and presented beautifully.  Chips and salsa arrive as you are seated.   The menu has a variety of choices and prices from starters to desserts. There is a full bar and the house margarita is a speciality.   We ordered a variety of dishes: flautas with chicken, beef fajita, carne asada and sea bass. We all thought our food was delicious and perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Go here and get Fernando as a waiter. Unbelievable service and amazing carnitas! Also get the homemade guac, great time!"}
{"text":"To bad Jennifer isn't going to be working on Saturdays anymore, they really need to do some training with this help, sat here for 30 minutes, waiters came over twice to take our order, both times asked for menus, he never brought it over. We had to ask another waiter. This is extremely unusual for this restaurant. We will start coming here only when Jennifer or Sergio are bartending."}
{"text":"5 stars for Duke. He makes the best pina coladas! He's typically there on Thursdays- definitely a must!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Table side guacamole was just okay, but much, much better after we added some salt and the hot salsa.  We tried the chipotle chicken fajitas and were beyond pleased.  Delicious flavors and enough for my husband and I to share to make our own burritos."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Went here for lunch with a friend and the food was spectacular.  Also, the service was excellent.  I would definitely go back.  The chips and salsa are amazing, as was the homemade guacamole (made at the table)."}
{"text":"Viewing the other reviews here, I could totally understand how this could be the kind of place that has spotty service. I came here with my co-workers on a night that wasn't very busy, and we had very good service, but it was just slow enough that it was on the verge of being not-so-great service.  I wasn't blown away by the drinks, but where I found this place's strengths was in the food. I had the Durango, which was basically a sampler plate featuring a chile relleno, a chicken mole enchilada, and a spinach enchilada. The chile relleno was tender and really brought out the flavor of the pepper, which I like more than the cheese-filled disasters that some restaurants serve. The chicken mole enchilada was delicious, I especially enjoyed the mole sauce. The spinach enchilada stood out the least but it was very tasty, just not as good as the other two dishes.  We also had very good guacamole and chips before our meal, and they were cool about us adding several more people to the table as the night went on. At the end of the night we had a decent sized bill (that my boss was cool enough to cover) so I don't think this is exactly the cheapest food in Scottsdale, but I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, atmosphere was chill. Even our baby girl seemed at home. I'd go there again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Wow! Came by for a late lunch- everything was fresh and didn't have that heavy feel of some Mexican food. Grilled veggies, stuffed pepper. Enchilada Veracruz and Guacamole all top notch! Great service and we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"We love Tivoli Village and are always looking for somewhere new to go. First time we ate there it was nothing short of delicious!! Service was friendly and helpful with out being pushy or intrusive. They told us about happy so we came back. They have an early happy hour as well as a late night. Even on FRIDAYS!!! So good and what a great deal. It's only in the bar but always great service. So much so we frequent there quite often. Oh did I forget to mention the do a great brunch with a free bloodymary or mimosa!! I'm jus say'n you gotta go....."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, Fantastic drinks, delicious foods and impeccable service. I love it here. Try the Rib-Eye wow  it's awesome"}
{"text":"Wait staff very friendly.  Food good.  Portions small but that's okay because they gave us plenty of chips and salsa to fill up on.  Kinda of slow to bring the check which is fine if you feel like relaxing for a bit. Overall not too bad.  Very nice and clean restaurant.  Great location. Was happy to spend time with family.  Dog friendly patio was a plus."}
{"text":"If you are looking for real mexican food this is not the spot. I ordered enchiladas and they were dry, bearly any sauce and they didnt come with any beans or rice or pico de gallo lettuce mix. I asked the waiter for some lettuce mix and he looked at me like he had no idea what for, and he told me I could order a side salad? Really? I wont be coming back."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying I am visiting from out of town. I am a native Californian who is accustomed to authentic Mexican food. After looking through various Yelp reviews, we decided to dine at this restaurant. The food was not what I consider Mexican cuisine. It became somewhat apparent when the kid meals sides included French fries instead of the typical rice and beans. I ordered the barbacoa plate. The tortillas were hardened and the meat was chewy. In addition, the tableside guacamole was bland.   To be fair, I will mention that the chips and salsa were great and I also enjoyed the ambiance. However, I would not consider dining there in future visits."}
{"text":"The ahi tuna tacos that everyone talks about. ..they are completely raw and cold.  I wish they had a seared option. However,  I was thrilled with the veggie enchiladas.  Vivian,  our fantastic bartender,  allowed me to get them 2 ways!"}
{"text":"Ordered the guacamole and the first time it was too spicy even though we ordered mild. It came back better the next time and it included cilantro which gave it a good flavor. I like that they ask you if you want red onion in it, which we didn't. The service was very slow and an ice tea took forever to be brought out. Food was ok but with the slow service, will probably not come back. They have a nice outdoor patio with reggae music playing which made for a nice atmosphere, but the service needs to improve if they want to have repeat customers."}
{"text":"Love the environment of Tivoli! Cafe Laredo has incredible table side guacamole, and a sizzling Mexican brownie that's amazing. Great patio dining."}
{"text":"The prices and food makes this one of my favorite place places to eat during happy hour.  My only complaint is the rice and ambiance. I always judge how 'good' of a Mexican place by their rice and beans. The rice tastes like Spicy Uncle Ben's. I HATE when restaurants use instant rice.   Secondly, it's too quiet in there. The bar is the only lively area. Music is desperately needed in all areas.  The prices on the regular menu are a bit high, too. The food does not dissapoint but, its not as enjoyable when youre paying that much. Other than that, definitely a cantina to try."}
{"text":"The good: I've ordered the same item both times I've been here and it was delicious. It was the camaron poblano asada. It had shrimp with mushrooms sour cream and I believe vegetables stuffed in a poblano pepper and a skirt steak carne asada wrapped around it, on a bed of lime rice and corn. Excellent choice.   Here's the not so good: There are quite a few other Mexican restaurants in the area that have way better food with lower prices. We have gone two times, the first time it was $87 for 2 entrees, 2 margaritas, guac, and a kids meal for our toddler. Yesterday when we went it totaled out to $72. Our server happened to be great yesterday (Theresa)....HOWEVER, on our first visit, the hostess placed us all the way in the furthest room in the back, completely by ourselves (even though over half of the restaurant was empty). We found this very odd, were confused and ended up asking them to move our table. Yesterday the hostess placed us away from the front section again. Our seating wasn't in the far back of the restaurant this time, but it was another back room by ourselves. Additionally, there were workers fixing booth seats and standing on ladders, installing ceiling lights RIGHT next to us. Aren't these things supposed to be taken care of prior to opening up shop? We were considering making reservations here for Father's Day and bringing the rest of our family, but now we have decided otherwise."}
{"text":"They don't give you the Mexican experience and didNot live up to my expectations, the food Deserves a Two star. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"The Nachos were WAY over priced.  $11 for 6 chips.  See Pic. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cantina-laredo-las-vegas#E_MHz862cJ6Isqczx2lQMQ"}
{"text":"My favorite mexican food! Love the fish tacos, guacamole, and chili rellenos. It's a little more contemporary food as opposed to authentic but it is really good."}
{"text":"I'll make this one pretty short and sweet... I would consider this place an upscale version of like a Chevy's or similar restaurant... the food was delicious, the portion size is not as big as Chevy's, which if you're on a diet or don't like to bring your food to go, is a good thing. They brought out chips and salsa which both salsa's were good. One was spicier than the other. Waiter was great and customer service was nice. They would check constantly if we needed anything else. Expect people to be dressed up when entering this restaurant....A great place to take someone on a date."}
{"text":"Had the nachos.  Girlfriend had enchiladas.  Both were great!  Reasonable prices.  Comfortable atmosphere.  Nice setting/ambiance.  Our server Danielle was 5 star!  We absolutely will be eating here again."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is usually slow to non existant."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with the boyfriend. We sat at the bar drank beers and had chips and guacamole, soooo yummy. When I go there for dinner I love the steak fajitas. The service is great and everyones always so nice."}
{"text":"We arrived after 9p.m. so got the 2nd happy hour! basically ordered appetizers (Ahi tuna tacos,barbacoa tacos, mahi mahi tacos and Queso Laredo) and Margaritas,Everything  we got was very good and perfect for a late dinner. Still had to take home leftovers and didn't break the bank! The Hostess Devyn was also our waitress probably due to the time of day. She was extremely friendly, attentive and helpful"}
{"text":"Got here at 1pm. Only two tables eating lunch. The Chips and salsa is quite fabulous! Ordered spinach enchiladas, it came with sautéed zucchini and rice.  My friend ordered chicken enchiladas. We ordered the cream sauce On the side because I was afraid of all the YELP reviews about the excessive cream.  I thought is was a wonderful lunch. Total lunch bill for two people was $28. Including a $4  Bud light. ( little pricey) but no different than eating anywhere else.   I did not order the table side guacamole, but to defend the $9.99 price, I watched it being made at the table next to us. The waitress used three huge avocados, which are $1.99 each right now at Bashas.  So people that are complaining about the price of the table side guacamole price really should go buy the ingredients yourself and make it at home.  What else???  The place is huge and has a corner location. I can't imagine the rent on the building!  I thought the prices were fair, they have coke products (not flat coke either) it is a nice clean location and every staff member was very attentive . The waitress was pleasant and well groomed.  I would go back.  So that's my review in a tortilla shell! HA!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good! A smaller, semi- fine dining mexican restaurant with a great bar. Our service has always been very good, and the food is quite fresh. Great location in the heart of everything at San Tan Village. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo has become my favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas. It isn't super authentic like the Michoacan chain, but more of something you would see opened by a celebrity chef on the strip. The quality and portion size is excellent, and the margaritas are great! They have a good happy hour, but I really wish they would extend it out to the beautiful patio area they have, and maybe stay open a bit later during the summer (see Kona Grill handbook). Looking forward to my next visit already!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for the first time and the hostess was too busy flirting with a group of young boys to even notice us standing there waiting to be seated. Horrible customer service!  We no longer have the desire to even try this place. If the hostess won't even acknowledge your presence I can only imagine what the rest of the service would be like. If I could give zero stars I would."}
{"text":"Their Sunday brunch is great. Our server Chris H did a outstanding job. He kept the  mimosas coming the whole time and for only $2! You've got to check out the patio it's a great place to get together with friends for a large party as it can take care of just any size group. The food was outstanding we had Vegan enchiladas They made them special for us really really good."}
{"text":"This is one of my local favorites. The chips and salsa are awesome and so far, we have enjoyed everything we have had on the menu. It's got a nice bar area that is good for happy hour and free chips and salsa. Occasionally the hostesses aren't too friendly, but the waiters are always very nice."}
{"text":"Meh. Well...worse than meh.  Here's the thing. The food isn't very good and the prices are insanely high. Actually, the food was almost bad and the prices were out of control, BUT the service was pretty good and the chips and salsa were amazing, so there are your 3 stars.   When you first walk in you will notice bowls of avocados sitting on your table.   \"OMG! I bet they make table side guacamole!\" I exclaimed.  Well they sure do. For $10. Fuck that. $10 is too much for a tiny mini bowl of 2 avocados mixed with chili seasoning and onions. Unless I'm drunk or really hungry, which means I will buy anything. But I wasn't, so I didn't. No table side gauc for me.  Next, the main course. Everything on the menu is beef, pork, chicken or beef, pork, chicken and cream. What if you aren't a huge fatty and CARE about your health? What if you want fresh fish or veggies or if you want your beef/chicken/pork without cream. I guess I shouldn't have eaten that second bowl of tortilla chips, huh? Now I am on a fat rant.  So I order enchiladas - but for the love of god HOLD THE CREAM. The enchiladas were disappointing. I'd give them a C+ or maaaaaaybe a B- because they came on a bed of spinach. (interesting). Maybe the cream would have saved them but I don't think it is necessary to add cream to make a good enchilada, and neither do most Mexican restaurants with much better  ones. The enchiladas were at most bland and blah and not worth $14. I don't mind paying a lot for good Mexican Food, but this wasn't very good.   I was eating with fellow yelper Scott S. He had the chili relleno. He said is was below average.  By the way, their cheese enchiladas had CHUNKS of beef in the enchilada sauce. Mind you, these are a separate menu items from the beef enchiladas. So your choices are:  Enchiladas with beef Enchiladas with cheese and secret beef, of which you become aware of after you bite in Enchiladas with cheese, secret beef and cream  Blech. Die.  At least the iced tea was flowing and the chips and salsa were seiously kick ass.  Hmm... if I wasn't in a generous mood I might be tempted to take away another star. But I won't. Just like I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This is a nice place, with a good happy hour.   For happy hour, from 4 PM till 7 PM, they have five dollar margaritas and half off of their bar menu food items. A good deal!  They serve you free chips and salsa, and the salsa was spicy and the chips were freshly made. The food, from the bar menu, is good. The bar menu includes queso dip's, tacos, sliders, etc.    The service is good, and it was not too packed up on a Monday night.   They have a nice bar, and a large restaurant. Overall it's decent Mexican food with a good happy hour."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in Vegas! Great service and food! Try the Ahi tacos and the carnitas. That's all I ever get!"}
{"text":"I had the fajita steak burrito and it was excellent. Great portion and reasonable price. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Very good food service and atmosphere. The happy hour specials are also good. The price is also right. Don't forget to try the hand crafted tables idea guacamole."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and the food is decent and mimosas on sunday are $2!!! Cant beat it!!"}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo is absolutely wonderful! They hosted a brunch in their private room for my association last Saturday. The service was excellent, food was Amazing! The room was bright and beautiful and even had a tv set up for presentations (which we will be needing in the future). It was such a pleasure to coordinate the reservation with the general manager, so friendly and easy to book. I can NOT wait until we return again in September!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is excellent ! I have tried several items of the menu an everything is fresh and tasty. Perfect balance of flavors and spice. Service is attentive and the kitchen is on top of their game. Prices are reasonable and if you are around for Happy hour,  you'll be amazed."}
{"text":"We stop in for Mothers Day! No wait, ate in the bar just perfect for the 4 of us~ great server Jaclyn. Turned out to be a very nice outing."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of fancy Mexican food. I don't think we need it to contain beets or whatnot. It is very pricy and in a state where Mexican food is so prevalent I feel like they are trying to make themselves look better than what they are. Save your money and go to the tacos stand down the street you'll be happier."}
{"text":"We saw this on yelp and thought we would give it a try. It was wonderful . Service started out a little slow but quickly changed.  The restaurant atmosphere was nice and it appeared to be very clean(dark lighting).  There was a variety of food and our family all liked the dishes that were served. They even had a nice children's menu just in case your children don't like tacos.   Now let's get to the best part . The dessert Mexican Apple pie in a sauce with ice cream on top. It was out of this world!  I would definitely recommend this place! We are from out of town and when we make the trip again we will be back."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Tuesday night and was told it was a 20 to 25 minute wait. There were no more than 5 parties in the entire restaurant! Every single table in the front room, but apparently they had some large groups that were going to come.   With so many choices in the area, this was our last attempt at this place."}
{"text":"Just learned this location is CLOSED for business. Goodbye, beloved Cantina Laredo. I visited this location for over 10 years and never had a bad experience. Food, drinks were always fresh, tasty and at a great price. Can't imagine where I can go in the area to find a comparable deal and experience! We'll miss you!"}
{"text":"Hands down the strongest margarita I ever had in my life. Good when you're only having one and chatting it up with friends. Bad when you don't know when to stop and you find yourself stumbling to the bathroom, not knowing whether you want to throw up or order more guacamole (made in front of you at the table-delish with extra jalapenos- dirty look to those wusses I have gone with who have opted for less spice).   The ambiance is just right: dimly lit, comfortable booths (happy hour is only at the bar or at the tables surrounding the bar though), and friendly staff. The happy hour is great for the drinks. The HH appetizers, however, can be a little on the skimpy side, so go for an entree if you're famished. I made the mistake of getting the appetizer ceviche, which came with a few lonely anorexic shrimp that I wanted to feed instead of eat.   My favorite dish so far :The cilantro chicken salad (I subsitute steak for chicken, and ask for an extra little side of their amazing dressing).  Great for a date or just to meet with friends to gossip about dates. One of my regular spots that is worth trying out."}
{"text":"First off this was my third time here and I did not pick the locale for the Ladies Who Lunch munch, as my two previous visits would never warrant a return for a third shot.  But I dummy up and defer; all the while repeating a please don't suck mantra with my inside voice and  hoping three's a charm rather than three strikes you're out.  I'm the only one drinking and I'm pretty jazzed about sucking down some post-morning mojitos.  It can only lend to my magical thinking and help me ignore the do you think she might need a liver transplant in the future glances from my comrades.  What arrives is a very attractive Mojito complete with fresh perky mint, but alas, all style and no substance with its artificial lime undertone, the liver can go to someone else.  What we picked, shared and compared:  The Top Shelf Guacamole prepared table side.  After much ferreting, poking, probing into this mushy mound I though I heard a faint whisper.  Can you taste me now? What about now?  Umm, that would be a NO!  Bland and tasteless through and through.  Beef & Chicken Combination Fajitas.  A pretty plate of more banal and tasteless food (chicken that tasted as if it had been boiled first); except for the horrid overcooked and sour tasting rice, which was pathetically terminal, not worth saving and best left to science.  Torta De Pollo.  Nothing to say as there was nothing to taste.  Did Sysco not deliver spices this week?  Chimichanga De Pollo Poblano.  The best of the lot, but not by much.  More than half is sitting in my fridge and destined to be sent to the dumpster or Smithsonian.   Nice enough decor, pleasant enough service, but than doesn't save the third epic food fail.  Three strikes!  Out!  Game done!  Series over!"}
{"text":"I freq Cantina Laredo at the least 2x a month. The staff (especially the bartender) are always superb. I ordered the table top guacamole as a starter & omg Carlos really made the guacamole come 2 life!! This place NEVER disappoints.  GOOD food and serviced is hard to come by now a days.  Please allow me to thank you for your continuous AWESOMENESS"}
{"text":"Chef Damon knows what he's doing in the kitchen! The food is amazing! Too bad I always fill up on the chips and salsa, they're addicting! Everything on the menu is bomb, you can't go wrong here"}
{"text":"Based on our experience and the other Yelp reviews I would say management needs to provide some basic training to the entire wait staff on how to handle dining customers in a restaurant.   We arrived at Cantina Laredo at 8pm on Memorial Day evening, planning to have drinks and a leisurely dinner. The restaurant was open until 10pm that day, and was less than half-full when we arrived.   Our server arrived at our table about two minutes after we were seated, and rather insistently asked if we were ready to place our order. There were menus at our table when we were seated, but we were still figuring out which cocktails we were going to begin our dining experience with and we hadn't even looked at the food offerings. We had been told by Cantina Laredo on the phone just a couple of hours before we arrived that they were having drink specials on Mimosas and Bloody Marys all day that day. Our waitress denied this and told us that they were not having any drink specials that day.  So my GF hurriedly ordered a Sangria and I hadn't really had time to understand the bar offerings so I just passed on the libation and ordered water.   After about 5 minutes the waitress was back and we placed our food order. A minute or two after that her Sangria arrived.  She had only taken a couple of sips of her drink when our food arrived. So much for a leisurely and pleasant dinner out. It became clear to us that we were in a kind of \"Lunch Rush Express\" situation, like \"How fast can you get `em in and get `em out?\"    Was this an over reaction to all the negative reviews about their slow service? In any case service that is too fast can be  just as bad as service that is too slow, especially when menu prices tend toward the higher-end and the restaurant is not in the least crowded.  25 minutes after we were seated our check was placed on the table. Our planned leisurely drinks and dinner on a holiday evening were not going to happen at Cantina Laredo. We've had longer sit-down meals at a Taco Bell.  BTW I ordered the mole enchiladas which were good but the portion was very small. I don't remember what my GF ordered because the whole thing went so fast."}
{"text":"Not bad...overall.  Not the best Mexican food we've had in town.  In my wife's words, \"I wouldn't mind going back,\" but we won't necessarily be in a huge hurry.    Food was decent - my wife had the mahi-mahi tacos, I had fajitas.  We split a tortilla soup to start with.  We were both pretty satisfied.  The chips and salsa we had were tasty too.  Wish they would've refilled them.  My mojito was made well too - I've had plenty that were not.    Service was friendly, but slow.  We waited quite a while for our food on a seemingly slow night.  Atmosphere was kind of dark overall.  Some sections were completely closed off with all the lights turned off, which gave the space kind of a dingy feel.  Being a teacher..... C+/B- in my gradebook!"}
{"text":"Came on the 4th of July. Place was dead, understandably. Had all our kids with us. Our server was nice and attentive. He answered all of our questions and made recommendations which we took and enjoyed. The Tampica was great. My wife had veggie fajitas that were amazing. Drinks are STRONG. All around a really good meal"}
{"text":"For our first time here I couldn't have been more impressed. The lunch menu was light and flavorful. Table side guacamole was superb and our waiter Angel was fantastic! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I am only give it two stars because they did have good guacamole. As for the rest of the food it would get 1 star.   I thought it was impossible to mess up tacos but these were so bland! I even drown them in salsa to try and help them but that didn't even work.   I have zero plans to go back to eat but would maybe do drinks and guacamole."}
{"text":"Average food. Decent service. The brownie was hard. The fresh guacamole was good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Can't beat the happy hour. And the bartender Eric was awesome. Great drinks, great food."}
{"text":"Our server Laura was amazing.  Jumped in when she realized we had not been approached after being seated.   Loved CL in Las Vegas, and happy to see the quality is the same here in Westlake, OH.  See ya'll at the next happy hour!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food in town!!!! The queso dip with ground beef is to die for!! Their salsas are also delicious!! Their margaritas are so strong with a lot of tequila and NOT sweet at all!!! My favorite dish is the cheese enchilada with mole sauce on top.  Their black beans as a side dish are excellent! The only item they need to add to the menu would be a taco salad."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  Victor was an outstanding waiter and really listened to our requests.  We had the Veracruz with sour cream sauce as we can't eat very spicy food.  We also loved the Mexican apple pie with cinnamon ice cream and brandy butter sauce poured over it. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, portion sizes is just enough and very tasty. The restaurant is quaint we sat outside to enjoy the scenery. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Yummy Skinny Girl Margaritas with fresh tortilla chips and made while you watch guacamole?  Oh yeah, you got me!"}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo was fine, but I wouldn't bother driving all the way out there again unless it's because I'm already in the area for something else. The restaurant's decor is really nice, and it's obvious they're going for an \"upscale Mexican\" theme - kind of like \"Maria Maria\" in Tempe. Unfortunately,  both restaurants have overpriced entrees.   I'm perfectly fine paying $12 for enchiladas - but for god's sake, put something *worth 12 bucks* in them! I can make frozen spinach and mushrooms enchiladas at home, you know? It's not that the food was bad, it just wasn't as creative as I had hoped it would be.   Also, the guacamole that they make table side had enormous chunks of jalepeno in it, which was odd. Generally, I would think the pieces would be smaller and, therefore, more palatable. I've had guacamole plenty of times in Mexico and they've never put enormous hunks of jalepenos in it! My friend and I both enjoy spicy food, but were choking on them the whole way through the guac and ended up having to pick them all out.  On a positive note, we both really liked the mango margaritas and the two salsas they give you at the start of your dinner.  Overall, if you're in the area, I'd suggest coming here. But don't expect anything earth shattering, simply expect a flavorful, relaxed meal."}
{"text":"Overall terrible. We sat at the bar to grab a quick appetizer and drink. There were only six people at the bar (including us) and the bartender, Juan, who may have been training someone.  Terrible service. Juan forgot about us several times.  Drinks forgotten. Forgot to bring the bill. And, seemed to stand at the back of the bar near the bar entrance so no one could get his attention.  I actually walked around to tell him we wanted our bill and he still forgot. I don't know if he was having a bad day, he wasn't friendly, and didn't seem to want to be there. It made me feel like I didn't want to be there either. Appetizer was terrible. We ordered queso. It was luke warm, looked like it was congealed and someone had just thrown in ground hamburger, onions, and tomatoes on top. The chips were stale and cold. Tasted like the oil was old. I haven't been here in 8 years, and it was not anywhere I will be going back to."}
{"text":"Table-side guacamole was really good. Prices seemed fair. Chicken enchilada was really good, beef was just ground beef. Things tasted good,  but I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a better rating, but only some of the food is pretty good. It's super inconsistent in each meal.  Each time I've been here I've had the same experience with the chips: they are TERRIBLE. Super cheap and thin, they are super fragile, and they taste kind of like those really cheap crappy chips you buy from the bargain rack at a grocery store in bulk. The chips are just awful. Which is a shame! Because the chili con queso, while still tasting kind of cheap and crappy, tastes good. And the salsas are really good! I just have to load them onto these totally crap chips.    Last time I was here I had some fajitas with chicken and jack cheese and bacon. I forget the name, but it was really delicious. Unfortunately, the rice and beans that come with it taste like they're just bulk-bought at a supermarket. The rice is kind of flavorless and the beans are super watery, and also don't have much flavor. The main dish, the chicken and bacon and cheese and onions and peppers, that was delicious though.  The time previous to my last visit, I ordered the tacos. Holy cilantro! I hate cilantro. HATE it. Typically if I forget to order something without it, I don't have too hard a time either pulling it off or eating a small amount of it, as long as there are other flavors to blend with. These tacos had a HUGE amount of cilantro on them. Ridiculous amount. I spend over 20 minutes picking it out of the tacos. Yes, it literally took me that long to try and get not all of it, even, just enough that I could eat the tacos and taste anything else other than the cilantro. Sure enough, this last time my wife ordered the same tacos and they came out with the same huge mountain of cilantro in each taco. It isn't even just on top, it's all mixed into every part of the taco. It's totally inedible, and my wife doesn't share my disgust for cilantro either. She's just normal, and even she found it inedible and spent a solid 5 minutes trying to get enough of it out of the tacos.  Lastly, It is not possible to have worse lighting. The directly-overhead-and-super-bright pot lights make reading the menu nearly impossible without constantly moving it around to avoid the glare spots. And it's super bright, it gives me a headache and since the lights are so focused there are weird super-bright-then-kinda-dark-then-super-bright-again spots all over the place. It's very straining on the eyes, and it's uncomfortable to sit in."}
{"text":"Guacamole prepared at your table. ..fabulous. and the nachos el carbon were wonderful.  Beef topped and cooked perfectly. Wait staff excellent. Wish they were in California."}
{"text":"We love this place. Usually go in for lunch on a weekend before a movie. They have the best margaritas! Large, strong, and made properly. Most places will use cheap sweet and sour and don't mix the ingredients properly or the pour is off. Not this place, you get a perfectly made delicious Margarita every time. I really hate spending the $10+ on a margarita and the bartender gives you this cheap sweet and sour gatorade color margarita that tastes like you will get diabetes. The restaurant is upscale and looks great. People on here complained about the price but it really isn't expensive by any means. Food is great. It's a different take on Mexican but in a good way that makes it inventive and fresh on the same dishes we all know. I'm surprised the average vote on yelp for this place isn't a 4 or higher."}
{"text":"This is a tough one. I arrived for a birthday party on 2/10/16 and told the hostess as much. She told me that there was a birthday party in the bar section as well as in the restaurant area. I looked around for my friends with no luck. Immediately, I assumed I must have had the wrong date or location, so I called the person who scheduled the partly. Lo and behold, they were outside. The hostess made no mention of that possibility and just let me sit around waiting for several minutes. Awkward!  Fast forward to finally being seated with my group and Edward, who is AMAZING, made up for the hostess' \"I don't really care about my job\" attitude. He saved the evening. The food he suggested and the service he provided were perfect. He had his hands full with a group of rowdy ladies and handled it like a champ. Give that man a raise."}
{"text":"Service was less than great.  GM Mark not receptive to comments or constructive criticism. To tell you he heard the same thing before but no change made to menu or waitress serving what you ordered correcting the errors in the printed menu is unacceptable.  The ahi tuna taco appetizer was amazing. The tortilla soup was just mediocre. The menu item stating it was chicken stuffed with shrimp and spinach only to be served between two dried out cutlets with a sauce and three shrimp and spinach in between these cutlets does not constitute stuffed by any means.  Go now because if things don't change this place won't make it for too long inSummerlin."}
{"text":"Super yummy!  We had just about everything om the menu and it was all great! Service was quick and attentive. Chile rellenos were cheesy goodness, the chicken enchiladas were outstanding and full of flavor, their happy hour nachos with fajita beef were great and the meat was tender and to top it off the strawberry mojito was sweet and refreshing. Prices were a little higher than other Mexican restaurants but we had a ton of food to take home"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They're guacamole is fresh and their queso Laredo is an amazing starter. I've tried their salmon with chimichurri sauce and jasmine rice which was delicious! I've also tried their chicken Tampico which was overly Charbroiled but the sour cream poblano sauce was tasty. Their beef is very flavorful and great in the fajita dish! But the brownie desert will melt in your mouth! Def an enjoyable date spot."}
{"text":"Go for the ambiance or the location, but certainly don't go for the food or the service!  We used to come here as a large group for their occasional tequila nights.  I tolerated the extreme price tag and endured the mediocre food because they gave us a private room, had raffles and awards, and the tequila flowed generously.    However, after three consecutive events where one or more of our group asked us to stop going there (usually because of bad food, bad service, or getting ill from the food), we stopped doing tequila nights.  Since then I have been back twice with other people for lunch. The first time I thought it must have been an off day, I figured they couldn't really be this bad and still be in business.  The second time was my last - they really are this bad.   I haven't had fast food since 2003, but I'd drive through Taco Bell before I'd sit through a Cantina Laredo lunch.  So, bottom line, if you're just going for friends and drinks, it's a great place.  If you're expecting decent service and tolerable food, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food, fresh table side guacamole is the best, and the margaritas are all made with fresh lime juice great tequila selection!!!!"}
{"text":"good service, I liked the green rice.  The seafood enchilada I had was pretty good I feel some of the dishes are overpriced though"}
{"text":"Come during Happy Hour!  Our family of 4 can eat here pretty reasonably during Happy Hour, including margaritas for mom and dad.  Complimentary chips and salsa!  Out favorite on the HH menu is the sliders with guacamole and bacon!  The quesadillas are yummy as well!  We always get right in and have good service."}
{"text":"Sit at the bar! Eduardo is quick and has the best recommendations! Ahi tuna tacos are delicious"}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend going for the food. The drinks on the other hand were pretty good. Had i not had the \"Casa Rita\" to save my dinning experience i would have ranked this place a two star.   Go for the drinks, skip the food."}
{"text":"On a warm and windy night in Summerlin NV, enjoyed the fresh chips and salsa and the outside seating.Margaritas, fresh fish and ahi tuna tacos were excellent.  Located in the Tivoli Village which in itself is interesting."}
{"text":"Excellent food, margaritas and desserts - need I say more?"}
{"text":"Was there on Thurs evening. The atmosphere was relaxing , margaritas tasty, fajitas very good and the guac was the best I've ever had! It was my first visit ever and I will be returning :)"}
{"text":"Came in on Tuesday for a little happy hour Margarita and small dinner to find out now they have raised their prices considerably, a dollar on all their happy hour items and a dollar to their Margaritas, there was no one in here, don't wonder why with the food quality going down and the prices going up, you will kill your own business. Our server was very friendly and with no real business, she had time to chat with us."}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo in San Tan Village was a huge disappointment. This was not our first time here, which is why our expectations were so high. We went there for two things: Beer and the guacamole... and they couldn't get it right. It was a Saturday night at the peak dinner time. We were seated right away and someone brought us chips and salsa, but no water.  When the waitress arrived we ordered 2 beers and the top shelf guacamole that they make at your table. We started eating the chips and salsa salivating for our beers. My husband had gone to the restroom and the waitress set up shop right in front of his chair and started making the guacamole. I didn't say a word because I was stuck on the words that came out of her mouth when she arrived: \"The bar is taking care of the beers so I asked someone to bring you some waters in the meantime\". What? I can see the bar from where I'm sitting. I can get a bottle a beer myself.  And the waitress was not doing us a favor by getting water. We should have had a glass of water regardless.   When my husband returned the waitress moved out of his way and apologized for being in his way. We were completely done with this waitress when we tasted the guacamole. I don't know if it was her first time making guacamole or what. It was disgusting. It was overbearing with lime. You couldn't taste anything else. We finally got our beers and downed them as fast as we could so we could leave. My husband tasted his water and then tasted mine. He asked me if I tasted my water. I did, and I didn't think anything of it. It tasted like tap water. I tasted his and it tasted like cleaner. We were completely disgusted. Our bill was $20 for 2 beers and nasty guacamole. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Always a great time. Great food & great service. I recommend the Top shelf guacamole. Also try the pescado tacos"}
{"text":"Can't say I go out for \"upscale\" Mexican food often, but when I was sitting outdoor at Poppy Den, I saw Cantina Laredo's outdoor dining space and thought it would be a great place for a few drinks oh and some food too.   Anyway, came here with my husband and two dogs just before noon on a Monday.  I walked into the restaurant to ask for a table outside, but was shocked when the restaurant was completely empty, I thought it was still closed, but it wasn't. The host showed me a table outside, but we requested to be near railing to tie up the dogs and he happily let us to choose it. No bowl of water for the dogs, but that is ok...we had one.  We ordered a few glasses of wine which averaged $9/glass from a list of 12  wines..all decent and familiar.  The pour was atleast 6 oz., which is generous these days. Then I ordered the two appetizers for my lunch because they had the fewest carbs...ceviche and tuna mini tacos. My husband got one of the enchiladas entrees.   The ceviche was decent and fresh, but probably a bit salty for most people...I liked it, especially paired with my glass of Brut.  The tuna in my tacos was unexpectedly sweet, but with a little salsa and habanero sauce (we requested)...it tasted really good.  However, limiting my sugar and starch intake, my husband finished it off. He said his enchilada was solidly good, but said I make better enchiladas at home.  I did train him well.    So why 4 stars?  Love dog friendly places, the price to portion to quality ratio was all good, and service was quick and attentive, but that could be because there were only 6 people in the entire restaurant.   Let's see if the next time I come here my experience is just as good."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, we were expecting some decent chow, but this place was a huge disappointment. Nice décor. Service was good and friendly...it's not the servers' fault that the margs were just OK and the only food worth eating is the chips and salsa. Steak tacos were OK, but we certainly wouldn't go back for them. We also ordered one of their signature dishes -- flank steak wrapped around a stuffed poblano chili -- and it was bland and tough, and the accompanying veggies were mushy. Worst item we had was the queso fundido -- I'm pretty sure it's watered-down Velveeta with yesterday's taco meat thrown in. And it's pricey. We definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Good place, the mole was pretty good and had an enchilada. Chips and salsa were so so. The dessert are pretty amazing. Good location and and wait staff friendly. I give them 4 enchiladas."}
{"text":"I would say it is actually about 3.5 stars.  We had a group of 8 at Cantina Laredo for happy hour and we had a great time!  The happy hour menu is quite large, half off the regular price (equaling around $4-6), and some of the items are quite unique.    I had the Steak Fajita Flat-bread and the Ceviche.  The Flat-bread was outstanding and perfectly crispy!  I loved the taste of the caramelized onions with the steak marinade!    I was not a big fan of the ceviche. It only came with two 'fancy chips' to scoop up the ceviche and there was a ton left, so after that I had to use the tortilla chips that came to the table earlier.  It also had olives in it, which I thought did not taste well with the fishy taste.    I also had a HUGE margarita for only $5!  It wasn't the best I have ever had, but for $5 I would drink it again!   Many in our group ordered taco plates to share.  The plates come with 3 decent sized tacos; they all tasted good, but some were more exciting that others (one set was pretty bland).   At the end our server brought out a dessert platter!  We almost ordered all of them (4), but instead we opted for the apple, chocolate and pineapple desserts to share for the whole table.   We all decided the chocolate and apple deserts were the best and came on a sizzling plate of caramel with melting icecream on them.  I highly recommend either of those desserts; they were quite impressive to look at and eat (see picture)!  Our server was just okay.  We had to repeatedly ask for a few things and we waited quite a while after we ordered.  But, he was busy and we were a big group.  He did however, split up our check very efficiently, which seems like a burden for most places!  The atmosphere is pleasant, warm and inviting.  It definitely qualifies as a 'fancy' Mexican restaurant.  I will definitely come back, and I am excited to try more things off the extensive menu!"}
{"text":"Well appointed and decorated location with friendly staff who were very good at their job. Sunday morning started with a delicious bloody mary and really well made chips and salsa. For our entrees we selected the migas which were painfully dry and very under seasoned and the vegetable omelet which had perfectly cooked eggs but the vegetables inside were way under-cooked. They really needed a few minutes in the saute pan the mushrooms were crunchy, not in a good way. The plain red potatoes that were either boiled or cooked on a low temp and then covered in a mound of flavorless white cheese. The potatoes were probably the saddest side dish I have had in a restaurant in a while. Please check the master recipe as I cannot imagine someone in the menu presentation said these were good. That being said the fried tortilla with cinnamon sugar and fresh fruit were the stars of the meals. We had high expectations but were underwhelmed by the entrees."}
{"text":"This place is great for their margaritas and table side guacamole (so good! They make it right at your table). They have a few tvs near the large circle bar so it's even an ok place to watch a game. I've only had the food once and i got chicken tacos which were good, large portions, just nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"This is officially our last time at Cantina Laredo. On multiple occasions, they don't have \"good\" avocados to serve, which is odd for a Mexican restaurant. We have also noticed that they are always under staffed and behind on service."}
{"text":"This place has a great location in Tivoli Village. They have a good indoor outdoor bar and several inexpensive offerings for happy hour. One of the best features of this restaurant is that they allow your dog to sit out with you on the patio while you dine.   The food is not traditional (authentic) Mexican food which doesn't bother me. But, the poor execution is an issue. We have eaten here a handful of times. I guess because I keep hoping to select something on the menu that I love. Unfortunately, that hasn't happened. The highlight of the menu is their guacamole and chips which are made table side. Their complimentary salsas are also very tasty.   I would give Cantina Loredo another try. It's a shame that we haven't found a good Mexican restaurant in the Summerlin area. My husband likes this place a lot more than I do. He is a fan of the fajitas. So, the 3 star review is an average of both of our opinions."}
{"text":"Met a girlfriend for dinner.  We wanted to have a nice meal and a drink and sit outside.  The weather was just perfect with a slight breeze blowing.  There were not a lot of people on the patio so it was really relaxed.  What we didn't know is that Thursday nights are Ladies' nights.  The bar area was hopping with patrons.  I made a mental note to try that later.  We filled up on fresh guacamole and chips and then I had the appetizer Ahi Tuna mini tacos.  The mango margarita was strong so I only had one. The Tuna tacos and the mango margarita makes me a happy girl.   Juan was our server and he was very helpful and attentive during our meal.  My friend needed to speak with the manager about corporate events and Juan brought him right over.  The manager was very accommodating and told us what he can offer to take care of a large group.    It's good to note they have a glassed room for groups in the front of the restaurant which allows a lot of natural light in.  They can do a special menu for a group and can accommodate comfortably about 28 in that room.  Fun spot and great food.  I look forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"Still awesome!  WE ****LOVE**** the guacamole that they make at the table, and the apple pie at the table.  The pineapple margarita wasn't my favorite.  We have gone for lunch several times, and love the happy hour too."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant & oval bar very nice. They have patio too. Happy hour is excellent with a great personality bartender & scratch margaritas part of the deal. Enjoyed very much mahi tacos & on regular menu chicken mole enchiladas."}
{"text":"I am torn on this review....   Met some friends in here for dinner.  We love Tivoli and frequent many of the places here, although they are turning over quite quick these days.  I sat at the bar and had a cocktail.  Service was impeccable and  the chips and salsa were served quickly and were YUMMO!  Friends joined me at the bar and we tasted some tequilas before settling into our table in the dinning room.  That is where things went down hill.  I would say at least 10 minutes passed before anyone stopped by our table.  He then said he was slammed and would be by shortly.  He stopped by again about 5 minutes later with waters and swooped away again.  Finally came and got our order, it was pretty simple, ceviche appetizer, combo fajitas and a salad to share between the three of us as entrees.  I also ordered a drink at this time.  Well food came out all together (not as requested) my drink also didn't show up yet....  He ran off to get the drink.  We realized we didn't get our tortillas for our fajitas, and we also needed chips for our ceviche.  It was just a disaster.  Then with a table full of dirty dishes he brings the desert tray over, REALLY??  I am sitting in garbage, could you clean it up PLEASE!   The food was amazing!!  I can't say that enough, but I would never eat in the dinning room here again.  I would stick to the bar.  Bartenders were awesome!!!"}
{"text":"The staff and manager are super pleasant and the food  was great. I asked for a vegan option and the burrito was perfect. Also  did I mention the chips and salsa?"}
{"text":"What's not to love? Their house margaritas are the best in town, and with happy hour their prices are even better. Their food is classic gourmet Mexican with a twist. I love their Sunday brunch!!  Their Juevos Rancheros was deeelicious (the Bloody Maria, too!) And the hot salsa they serve with their chips is my favorite. The service also gets 5 stars, whether it's their servers or bartenders. Expect a wait on Saturday nights, but that's pretty much with anywhere."}
{"text":"Well this Mexican food is not your classic Mexican. The food was okay. Nothing great. The service was very slow. I won't be back. But if you like to try new types of food I guess it would be worth a shot for you."}
{"text":"Great Guac! The apple pie was quite good. All of the dishes were good, but not authentic. Nice portions. I've only been there for brunch. Tivoli is a nice venue and the patio is the perfect place to eat."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The chips and salsa are the best in town. Food and service are both excellent."}
{"text":"6th time here as a Vegas visitor and unfortunately as much as I want to live this place, the service is just such a negative.  Decent margaritas, good chips 'n salsa, nice table side guacamole (tho's it's evident it's not the servers favorite thing to do). However, the service is a major detractor. One behind the bar during happy hour, and as it filled up she quickly got frazzled and we had to ask for every little thing, napkins under our drinks, a set up etc. Same story all the other times, staff is friendly but in attentive to customers needs and not good at checking in to see if anything else needed. We always leave frustrated wishing it could be a better experience. Upgrade and train the staff on the importance of good customer service and this place will go far."}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo is a newer, modern, well-designed bar/restaurant that is best enjoyed on a warm (or even hot) spring or summer night - its open air bars and outdoor patios are its greatest assets.  One bar-height outdoor table that seats about 8 surrounds its own bar height fire pit and this is a great find (they'll take reservations for it) when you want something special with a group in the evening.   This is not typical mexican food - they call it \"modern mexican\" and that it is.  Fusion Mexican might be another way to say it.  Don't come for slathered enchilada or giant Burritos.  This food is more delicate.  I'd say this is better as an \"eat in the bar\" spot than a restaurant (where ambiance is best), unless you get one of their outdoor tables (there are lots).  The bar area can be very charming when all the doors/bar areas are open and the warm breezes are blowing.  Staff is always great and friendly.  Food is ok, not much to write home about with the exception of the Ahi Tuna Tacos that are one of their most popular items.  I am addicted. They do also serve \"Skinny Margaritas\" which is a plus for those of us who don't want all the sugar found in a typical margarita mix and table side guacamole is a good choice. Great happy hour, btw - most appetizers at half price as well as all margaritas, and they have an all day HH on Saturdays until 5pm...And those great Ahi Tuna Tacos are on that HH menu.  Great early Saturday evening spot - to slip in there just as HH is ending, and grab a seat at the bar before the crowds arrive.  Like most Summerlin area restaurants the crowd is 35-60, with an emphasis on the older end,  mix of young families and few groups of 20 & 30-somethings."}
{"text":"Yummy!!!!! The Mahi Mahi was delicious. Our waitress was very pleasant and helpful. She made our experience even nicer than it already was!"}
{"text":"Mmmm, this place is pretty good.  The tableside guac is pretty great, and the chips and salsa are Chevy's knockoffs (a good thing).  I had the carnitas (obvi) and they were unique; served up on the bone, lamb chop style, and were fried to perfection.  It was actually a pretty light meal all things considered.  A little pricey, but a nice big place and great for groups."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner evening and all I can say is it was awesome. Be prepared the drinks are powerful here and we made the mistake of getting Tequila shots on the side..but the frozen Margarita house drinks did not need it. Needless to say we took our time drinking and eating so we could travel home safely. Fantastic time...we will definitely visit this restaurant again... by the way ... I had the chicken shrimp and spinach entree and John had the mahi-mahi tacos... so good!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Chips and Salsa:  I go to Cantina Laredo strictly for the chips, salsa, and guacamole so I can't review anything else on the menu.  The table side guacamole gets a 10/10.  I love the atmosphere and decor inside the restaurant.  Very clean and friendly.  They have a cute outdoor patio if you are looking for a nice spot to visit with friends.  To-go orders are always neatly packaged."}
{"text":"We are huge fans of this place!  Sit at the bar before 7 for great drink and food deals.  The chips, warm green salsa, Queso Laredo app, street tacos, and enchiladas are all favorites (skip the rice side - not the best), and DO NOT miss the brownie or apple pie desserts.  It's even worth going JUST for dessert!!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"We loved this place.  We were seated quickly.  Our drink order was taken right away.  Water and chips with two kinds of salsa arrived in no time.  One of the salsas was mild but really flavorful, the other a bit spicier but still great.  Our order was taken.  The waiter was very attentive and helpful.  But the food... The food was truly delicious.   My husband got the special: a filet with three sides: mushrooms, zucchini, and potatoes.  The filet was perfect, moist, flavorful and so tender!  All very yummy.  I ordered the enchilada Veracruz.  It came with zucchini, and rice.  The best rice I have ever had in a Mexican restaurant.  I ate everything except one enchilada because my husband wanted it and he shared his steak.  Finished it off with flan.  Which in my opinion wasn't the best we've had but close.  My husband believes it was the best.  We are going back and taking friends!"}
{"text":"We went to dinner here the other night. I'm giving it a generous 3 only b/c the mango salad and the desserts were amazing.  On he other hand we weren't very happy with a couple things, but we made the best of it. The guacamole was good but was too heavy on the onions. The meals themselves were ok but not great. I had the chicken enchiladas with mole sauce. It was not very good bc of the mole sauce. The waiter told us that the mole sauce was sweet and that's why we got the entree, it was not sweet it was just blah with no real flavor.  As I said the desserts were really good and amazing, we tried them all. Unfortunately before we left we used the restroom and it was very dirty and a mess. One toilet had (a mess), there where no toilet seat protectors and there was paper towels on the floor buy the sink.  We wanted to try this restaurant b/c I read good reviews on it and my family wanted to go. So we tried it, but we will likely not be going back. With all of the restaurants choices especially around in that area we were hoping for a little more."}
{"text":"This place gets worse and worse every time I come here. First off, they didn't have avocados to make table side gauc. Then I ordered chicken nachos and the chicken was rubbery, I had to spit it out. Also, the restaurant is dirty. They aren't even trying anymore. I would only come here bc it is down the street from my house but I guess I'll have to go to downtown Gilbert if I want a similar restaurant environment."}
{"text":"Came all the way from Oahu, HI to eat at now my Former Fav \"Mex Food\" Places. Very disappointed! Why did u mess with the ceviche recipe? It was perfect before. Guess I'll have to Pinterest and find the old recipe and make it myself.   Ivan still pouring awesome margaritas. Mahaloz brah!"}
{"text":"Only experience was happy hour but it was fabulous and inexpensive. We sat at the bar and received great service and stiff drinks. Great prices on their house margaritas and the chips and salsa are tasty. We love that you have other areas in the mall to walk around to when you are done with your \"festivities.\" We will definitely back for actual dinner at some point."}
{"text":"Food was okay, probably over priced for what we got. Not a whole lot to at other than that. You do get free chips and salsa though."}
{"text":"As long as you're not expecting Tex-Mex cuisine, Cantina Laredo works- menu has Mexican food staples like tacos, enchiladas, and nachos, but with a pretentious Tivoli Village location and upscale decor. Luckily the service is better here than other spots in the shopping center!  Placing an order for pickup was quick and painless- the 15 minute estimate was right on time, and as I waited the bartender made light conversation and offered drinks. They have a ginger-citrus concoction on special that I want to come back for.  The spinach enchilada is tasty- get over the fact that you're paying $10 for a single vegetarian enchilada, because this one is large and tastes really good. The cream sauce on top is obviously not vegan, and is a lot richer than most \"vegetarian\" menu items. But I'd get it again! The tortilla soup was just okay, but not something that stood out to me.  Location is nice, they have outdoor seating available for nice weather- not clear on whether they have a HH, but their tasty food and personable service will keep them in my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"My family's a regular here due to its location.  I love their Carne Asada lunch, but the best thing here is their top shelf guacamole!  They make it in front of you and you can enjoy it fresh with their complimentary tortilla chips.  Order that and a margarita and you're good to go!"}
{"text":"Great apple pie and coffee.  Stopped in for dessert with my daughter.   Had a great sweet encounter.  If in the neighborhood check it out be sure to say hello the the exec chef Damon!"}
{"text":"This place has some great gourmet style Mexican food and the margaritas are great.  We sat in the bar and our bartender was our server and he was great.  That guy reminded me of Tom Cruise by appearance so I am sure the ladies would love him too.  The only thing I can say bad about the place is you do have to pay a high price to eat here but if you don't mind that, it is worth it."}
{"text":"Monday evening happy hour in bar and on patio...great drinks & small plates. Terrific service and value!"}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo is a great TEX MEX style restaurant- that is important. Many of the negative reviews look like they were expecting southern California style Mexican food (Baha) with grilled fish tacos and 4 lbs of avocado on everything- THIS IS NOT THAT KIND OF PLACE. I originally went to a Cantina Laredo in Dallas a few years ago and this is pretty much exactly the same (although a little fancier inside).  That being said it is a pretty legit restaurant- if you have tried to eat Mexican in Las Vegas you probably have seen its a desert wasteland of options. Cantina Laredo is a little pricier than most (about 20$ minimum per person) but is pretty good food and service wise.  There is both a self park lot and valet -the valet stand is right across the round about from Cantina Laredo. The lot is not very far away but after you get Mex-ecuted at a big meal the walk begins to look more like a death march- I highly recommend valet.   The Food- Like I said , its Tex-Mex so order accordingly (fajitas for instance) . Start the meal off with some cheese dip or Guac- both are very good - and its one of the few places I have found in Vegas where you can actually get queso DIP instead of queso fundido- an item that should only be served to particularly hard to crack Guantanamo detainees. The regular salsa they bring you with the chips is OK but nothing special.   Fajitas- this is a pretty big amount of food for one person- if you tend to eat a lot of chips or order an appetizer you can easily get by splitting this for two people. The steak comes in larger than usual fajita pieces which I like as it generally means the meat is less dried out/overcooked in the middle. The chicken- who knows cause I would never order chicken fajitas this is America.  Drinks- most of the mixed drinks come a little too sweet for my tastes so I get some lime pieces and make sure and add some more lime juice. Other than that the margaritas on a scale of 1-Mesa Grill are about a 7."}
{"text":"Imagine Mary Smith goes to Los Dos Molinos. She leaves there saying: \"Oh my gosh Fred, that food was so spicy and I could barely understand that waiter. Let's go to Cantina Laredo because it's such a nice restaurant and the grilled prime rib fajitas with asiago cheese was delicious.\"  Yes, this food is completely tailored toward Mary Smith and judging by the reviews below, I think you will agree with me. The menu and cooking style truly reminds you more of a seafood+steak restaurant with a Mexican flare as opposed to genuine Mexican food. It's Americanized mexican food at its finest. Their guacamole and margaritas are great. This is a good place to go for hapy hour but don't go to this place seeking good Mexican food.  Nonetheless, it has all the features that make the Mary Smiths happy in this world. It's a clean restaurant with marble and glass. The waiters all speak English well and wear uniforms with ties. The food is not hot or spicy.  I think they will even sing Happy Birthday to you and give you a free cheesecake..who knows"}
{"text":"i was there for dinner ,   awesome  food , great service,  nice clean restaurant . best margaritas in town."}
{"text":"Great restaurant our regular waiter Manuel is one of the best waiters in the valley.  The gua tableside is great, draft Mexican beer is perfect.  Happy hr margaritas are excellent.  Now the food.  The Casabel ribeye is well lets just say fabulous, great halibut, and other southwestern dishes.  This is not a traditional beans and rice joint.  Its great  . Oh every few months they have a tequila dinner to die for"}
{"text":"A little disappointed that Blue Wasabi was closed (on a Friday afternoon-WTF...), the next place to grab something to eat was Cantina Laredo.  Place was a bit empty, but had a very clean and modern feel to it. The waitress was promt and was nice, she explained the ingredients in both the hot and cold salsa that came with the chips. It's nice that their chips and salsa are complimentary. Chips feel really light and airy, with a crisp in every bite. Salsa is not the regular chunky red stuff that you'll find at El Torito and On the Border, it's a brown, roasted, smokey sauce. Very different and pretty tastey.  I had the Tacos Al Pastor (Four corn tortillas with roasted, cascabel marinated pork), and she made sure to tell me that they were spicy. And were they!! Meat was a little on the dry side, but had plenty of dry, hot spice. I also had the side of refried beans and rice. They also made very sure that my cup of water was never empty. Spent around $12+Tip, so it pretty average price for 'gourmet mexican food'.  Think I'll stick with something a little more mild next time, it's hard to judge their normal food when I order the spiciest thing on the menu first."}
{"text":"I come in all the time for the carne asada and sit at the bar. During the day the bartender is Carlos and for the last month that I have been eating lunch here he really goes up and beyond for my needs. He's super friendly!! I have had only 1 issue with the food and Lilly the manager went so Incredibly far and beyond for me. This place had outstanding food and service!!!!"}
{"text":"Similar to El Torrito chain in Southern California, Cantina Laredo is fancied up Mexican food at a quality restaurant price. I had an appetizer, cannot recall the name but had three items, that was very good. A nice place to go for a sit down dinner date, for value I would go to Habanero's."}
{"text":"I was taken to Cantina Laredo for a birthday lunch and was lucky enough to take advantage of a tremendous Restaurant Week special!  The food was very fresh and very flavorful and had complex flavor profile!  The margaritas were great as is the patio and cool modern decor!  I loved it overall and will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since we've been here and it will probably be a while before we come back. The food was just okay, nothing memorable, nothing great. The service was just okay. A pet peeve of mine is not offering appetizer or dessert plates, especially when sharing an appetizer and dessert.  I had the enchiladas veracruz. It tasted...well...\"healthy\" although I don't think that was their intent. The tomatillo sauce was too light, almost like a broth, so there was hardly any flavor. The chicken was bland, the vegetables were bland. The salsa was my favorite part of the meal."}
{"text":"This was my second time here (previously for dinner and this time for lunch) - and I have to say this place wasn't that impressive, especially for the prices. If you're already in Tivoli Village maybe give it a go, but if you're in the car deciding-just go somewhere else.   This time around we ordered the tacos barbacoa ($11) and the beef enchiladas ($10) off of the lunch menu. Both were served with rice. The tacos were served with black beans and the enchiladas with pinto (we weren't offered a choice when ordering-so I want to point that out).   The tacos were two street tacos. The flavor was okay, but not spectacular. For the price I expected more. More flavor. Bigger tacos. A third taco. More something. The rice was undercooked. Im not a huge fan of black beans, so I wish the waiter would've asked or the menu indicated what type of beans each item is served with. In the end, I felt a bit rooked on lunch. Oh well.   I tried some of my husband's beef enchiladas (2) as well, served with pintos and rice. The beef was ground beef with a mixture of potato. I would expect a restaurant of this type to be above serving ground beef - something we can all easily make at home. Additionally, they were served with a con carne type of sauce, not enchilada sauce. The flavor was good. But again, the food underplayed for the price.   We also ordered the house margarita and the strawberry margarita ($11 each). Both were very good and the saving grace for lunch. They offer these at a discount for happy hour, which might be worthwhile if in the neighborhood.   In the end, I felt the menu prices, which are more expensive at dinner, reflected a high overhead rent for being in Tivoli Village and were not reflective of the food quality."}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent but service left much to be desired. Came to celebrate my birthday with friends, had to practically beg our server to smile or pay attention to us. In the middle of selecting our appetizers he just walked away, didn't return for 10 minutes. Got water in the beginning, couldn't get a refill until he was clearing our plates, despite our efforts to get his attention. Sangria is tasty but can't imagine any of us will return."}
{"text":"My daughter and i went out to eat every meal  over christmas holidays...we loved Cantina Laredo ...the server we had was great....the atmosphere  was great, food fresh, arrived promptly,  we thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience....we had been testing various Mexican style restaurants ...we compared restaurants over a weeks time from Sedona to Phoenix and this restaurant received our highest rating....I would recommend as Excellent....what a great holiday memory....also had wifi so,we could Skype with family....great touch...."}
{"text":"I have been visiting Cantina Laredo's for over 5 years.  We tend to visit weekly and it is a must when out of town guests visit. We also had our small wedding of 40 there. The manager Mickey was very easy to work with and helped us pick out items to work within our budget. I was very pleased and so were our guests.  Their food is consistently good. We tend to visit during Happy Hour which affords us the opportunity to dine there more often. Their happy hour menu is excellent. A variety of appetizers to choose from along with beverages. I often get the taco's, which are awesome. You get 3 taco's and can mix and match. Top Shelf Guacamole is made table side and from what our friends say, it's the best around.  All the Happy Hour items are nicely sized and pair that with a Margarita and who can go wrong?   When I choose to not go the Happy Hour route, I often get the chicken enchiladas with Mole Sauce. The enchilada's are made with all white meat, you can see what you are getting when your food arrives.  Food is not hidden by heavy sauces, cheese and beans.  The Torta de Carnitas with goat cheese, apricot spread and don't forget the fried egg is another great dish. The egg is meant to crack open over the sandwich and allow the yolk to add great flavor to the dish. The French fries have some jalapeño's in it for a little kick not to mention the seasoning is very flavorful. I am not sure if it the food or drink I crave, but couple the two together and it keeps us coming back.  The Margarita's are the best I have ever had, whether it's' the house, a seasonal or a flavor, they taste great. They use fresh limes and lemon's to make their house Margarita. No sweet and sour mix. I often get a seasonal Magritta, and they have all been great as well.. The bartenders, wait staff and managers are all very personable and know their customers.  This is my favorite restaurant in Gilbert and quite frankly out of Gilbert. I like the atmosphere, the food, the drinks and the people that work there."}
{"text":"Family of six. Enjoyed our meals. Great flavor. Very good service. We thought it was relatively inexpensive for the experience we enjoyed."}
{"text":"I wanted good Mexican food so I did a little Yelping and found this restaurant. Wowser!!! What a find! This restaurant serves gourmet Mexican food and it is fabulous! It is semi-expensive so come here only if you have the time to savor every morsel of a fine meal!  Also - the dress code is higher than T-shirts and jeans. This would be a great place for a first dinner date, special date night or evening with friends.  The ambiance is lounge-sexy with a touch of modern. They have a fireplace and outdoor seating and their bar is colorfully lit.  The food was out-of-this-world spectacular! The place was immaculate and the service was friendly and efficient. I will be back!  A solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Which means a lot being a California native.  Don't expect true California Mexican food, but do expect yummy Mexican food with a twist at reasonable prices.  By far the best chips and salsa crackin!!!! We come here at least once a week and they never mind if only order a drink and eat about 5 bowls of chips!  Truly a gem. Don't miss out.  Happy Hour is the best as well....... Steve the bartender is the man, always the best customer service!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"What a bummer.  I've been to this place a handful of times, and you know how it is, one bad experience and you get a bad taste in your mouth.  The service was atrocious, and the food was bla."}
{"text":"This place was really yummy. It was hard to choose off their yummy menu and I wanted to order three of each entree! Def try it out. Everything was great."}
{"text":"Extremely patient and accommodating. At times can be slow, but only because they are busy! Best happy hour in Vegas."}
{"text":"What happened to this place? A place known for good food and a good time is a shelter of its former self. No hostess showing up means that the customer should suffer. After our out of town guests and I spent time watching multiple staff members walk by snubbing us, a busser finally acknowledged us. We requested an outside table which we were denied because they \"can't move tables outside.\" So we settled for an inside table. After 'changing' their happy hour listing from what was published on local websites and being told that there was no hh, we decided to continue on with despite the pricing difference. We were served chips and salsa and i guess that was fulfilling the restaurant experience in their minds. No waters or an appearance by anyone to bring drinks or take an order. After over 15 minutes of our mouths burning on the spicy salsa with no relief in sight, we were finally acknowledged by a staff member, but the damage was done and we were sick of waiting and on to Brio where we were greeted with waters around...novel idea I know."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  I went there Thursday during happy hour and it wasn't even busy.  Once we were seated we had a chance to look at the menu.  However, not one employee In the place acknowledged us.  No one came to the table to offer us anything to drink.  After 10 minutes of sitting there with no service we decided to get up and leave. The hostess was kind enough to ask us if we were ok.  I had told her that we were sitting there for 10 minutes and nobody even acknowledged us and that I would rather go somewhere else. You would think that in a place like that the service would be a little bit better. Especially with the high prices on the menu and being located in Tivoli Village. And like I said before the place was not busy at all. The servers were just walking around doing nothing. Never again will I set foot in that place. And I will not be surprised if it doesn't last much longer."}
{"text":"Just had the Mahi Mahi tacos here.  Very delicious.  The meal was well prepared, full of flavor and yet light...not something you find commonly at a Mexican restaurant.  I often do not choose this as a go to meal due to the heaviness of this kind of cuisine.  The ingredients all seemed very fresh.  I would recommend this place without hesitation.  Plus I love strolling around Tivoli Village."}
{"text":"Flavors are not authentic.  They need to hire a chef who knows how to prepare excellent Enchiladas.  The enchiladas here were dry and I felt like they used the taco ground beef mixture in their enchiladas and served it on the plate without ample sauce and cheese wasn't quite melted."}
{"text":"I went here this past Saturday and was pretty excited because I'd been wanting to try it out for sometime. Everything started out well. Hostess and waiter were friendly. The two salsas that came out with the chips were delicious. I ordered the carnitas tacos and my wife ordered the fish tacos.  Both of us were pretty underwhelmed by the tacos. As for the carnitas tacos... It's not that they were bad, the flavor was good. I was a little put off by how messy they were. There was a lot of liquid in there and I'm guessing it was juice from whatever the carnitas were cooked in but I cannot say for sure. Like I said they tasted good but were quite messy. $15 for the three tacos I had was way too much. Without much effort, I can think of at least 5 other places where I can get three better quality tacos for $10 or less. The wife pretty much felt the same. Her fish tacos were good but not $15 good.   After tip... I paid $54 for six mediocre tacos, one beer and one margarita. In the future I will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We have been coming here ever since our first visit to Scottsdale years ago. Food is fantastic, portions are generous and we would recommend to all who enjoy Mexican food in a nice ambiance. It gets better and better each time we go. Oh and Dinner for two $40 and it was excellent!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party with 8 people.   Restaurant was mostly empty but service was very slow.  Server was argumentative when one order came out with wrong sauce.  We asked for extra corn tortillas and never got them.  The food was fine but service was mediocre."}
{"text":"Jacelyn gave us great service.  will come back for Happy hour. Great place to stop by for drinks after Work. Also they have places to shop."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with friendly servers and staff. The food and attentiveness of the the waitress were INSANELY good. So excited to have found such an amazing gem in our area. Just so happy to be able to sit and enjoy real good food with our family after the memorial service. Such a nice and accommodating place. 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa guy was totally on point but the service from the actual waitress was minimal. Would of loved a second margarita to go with my meal but she never came back  Food was good enough... I had the chili relleno and wouldn't do it again just cause of personal preference, it was too much cheese, especially following the cheese dip as our app."}
{"text":"Great food and great for brunch ! you get  a complimentary mimosa with this which is awesome! Ryan is a great server we always ask to be seated in his section .. The only draw back is the inconsistency with their Bloody Mary drinks and micheladas... If Ryan is not making our drinks we are hesitant to order any because of this ..."}
{"text":"If you want GOOD Mexican food at a reasonable price go elsewhere. If you want mediocre Mexican food at an overpriced rate, come to Cantina Laredo. I, however, did enjoy the chips and salsa because the salsa wasn't the typical red sauce salsa that other restaurants provide. This one was spicy and just right! I ordered a skinny margarita and did not get the margarita until AFTER the food I ordered came out.......that was a turn off. Even after the wait, the drink wasn't the greatest. I ordered two enchiladas and a taco with rice and beans (I forgot the name the called the dish). The food was SALTY! The beans were black beans (they were ok). The rice was weird. It wasn't bad tasting but it wasn't typical Mexican rice. It was green. Had onions in it. It was different.....the enchiladas were one beef and one chicken. They were SALTY. One of the enchiladas has a hot dog chili sauce on it. Like seriously?  I was NOT impressed by this location. I will drive 5-10 minutes to North Ridgeville and go to Fiesta Jalapeños for better food and better prices. Oh, and wayyyyyyy better margaritas. I'm sorry. I wasn't a fan. You give it a try and see for yourself. Hopefully, the food tastes better in the future. I would hate for such a beautiful location to go to waste..........maybe next time, but I won't be back"}
{"text":"This is the prettiest Mexican restaurant I've seen outside of Las Vegas. So nice inside!! Huge patios and bar. Good food, ask for the roasted tomatillo salsa, they don't give it to everyone but they will send it out if you request it. My server was Mark and he was so eager to blow us away with great service, that manager seemed very busy in the restaurant but still stopped by to check on us. We came in for a late dinner but will be back for what looks like a great happy hour."}
{"text":"Nothing like this place in Summerlin, fresh and new. I expect this to be a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"The restaurant is nicely decorated. It's definitely considered an upscale/ gourmet Mexican restaurant. They have a great bar area with a few tv's for sports nuts like me! They also have a nice patio, although last time we sat out there it felt a bit crowded and tight.   One thing that never changes is we always get the table side guacamole. Fresh and prepped to order!! As far as all the other items we've tried the food is good but I never seem to feel like 'raving' about it. Service also has been great every time. All in all- it's a place on our regular dining circuit just not a special occasion place for us!"}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo has it all! A fun, relaxed ambiance, smiling and friendly staff, a tequila selection Mexico would be envious of, and most importantly the hands-down best Mexican food I've ever had in Vegas, both in presentation and taste. I've been here a number of times, but the first time was on recommendation of a friend. That friend got a hi-five and Cantina Laredo got an immediate regular. It's normally the first place I go when getting into Vegas. I've had a number of great meals and times here, but one sticks out in particular. I was visiting with a group a few months ago. I eat everything and had an insane lobster eggs benedict (or possibly huevos rancheros this time-I dream about those two dishes nightly), but my group consisted of two vegetarians and two vegans. The chef Damon came out to our table, ran down the different items on the menu for the group, citing what was vegetarian and how they prepared them all, then proceeded to make something entirely new and specific to the tastes of our vegans. He then came out to check on said meal and ask for their feedback! The meal was excellent all around, as expected, and service like that is what puts special restaurants in a league all their own. Cantina Laredo is definitely one of these special restaurants, I recommend it to EVERY single person that asks me for tips on places to go in Vegas, and if I'm in Vegas you can bet you'll find me there."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner with family and friends here last night. I felt the it is really worth 5 stars but 3 other people in my party were not as impressed.  The shrimp appetizer was a bit weird. Otherwise they make fresh guacamole at your table just the way you like it. I would get that alone as a starter next time.   The food is made to be gourmet mexican...and they deliver. The stew was amazing as was the crab enchiladas.  When you walk in don't be afraid to look at other peoples dishes. Very social atmosphere.  It is pretty classy but casual at the same time.   I will definitely be back here. I think because they do have fancy interesting takes on classical mexican dishes. .it can catch people off guard.   Oh and the service was great! So was the desserts!! And yes I mean desserts :-)"}
{"text":"EExcellent .....feshly made guacamole salad super custom made .....clean ....very accomodating with kids .  Prices are good ....super delicious fiesta fajitas ....quail was fantastic .....I wish tortillas were made on site ....so easy to make .  Johnny the server was very attentive and knowledgeable ....and good sense of humour ...not intrusive at all.  Try the flan.....bravo!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We're from Northwest so not the best place for Mexican food there some good places. But this place is the best Mexican food we've had in a while. The salsa with the chips was great which is how I judge a Mexican restaurant initially. The service was great. My wife and I had the fajitas which a lot of times are just OK but these were very flavorful. And the margaritas were good to. We will definitely try to make it back here while we are in the area."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and watched a football game. Wife liked the margaritas and friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"This place is not a cantina, it's more like a contemporary place to eat,it's in Tivoli village do I need to say more ? Ok the food was ok not very spice our server was Lisa she was nice but I felt like I was on the lunch rush, three of us were at the table she had our drinks ice tea and soda yes flowing and I can't say if she ask how are meal was,my food was cold I had the tacos carnitas my friends had warm food,so we are eating and Lisa asked if we would like another bowl of chips,Yes , so I'm done three tacos and mind you on a 6 inch corn tortilla with not even spanish rice it kinda look like it but no taste and black beans I'm mexican why couldn't I have the option of refried beans, we had to ask if the dinner came with it I didn't see it on the menu if it stated it, so I'm working on the second bowl of chips while my friends were finishing there meal and Lisa comes and starts to clear the table,I got chips in my hand, I didn't want to cause trouble because I know I won't be going back and they didn't even play cantina music."}
{"text":"So this was my third time visiting this restaurant, first time was a good experience even though the service wasn't too great. After this last visit I will not be eating here again. We waited 45 minutes for our food, when we finally did get our food, it was cold. After explaining to the manager, Todd, how unhappy we were, he offered to comp our dinner and make the plate again. He was very nice and helpful and I thought ok we will give it one more shot we've already been here an hour and a half. Well the reason I'm giving 1 star is they literally sent out the same exact plate, once again barely luke warm. After being here for 2 hours I just wanted to get home. The manager Todd and our waiter Cesar tried to make up for the mistakes of the kitchen and their poor preparation of the food including the quality of the food but unfortunately we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I'll give a thumbs up for their mango margherita, but that's it. From the moment we arrived (a party of 4) there were issues as the hostess tried to figure out where she could seat us among the many open tables, several of which were apparently reserved. But the clodk was ticking till happy hour would end, so we just wanted a seat. The table service was very slow, and the food was not good. The description of their chile relleno (stuffed with raisins and other goodies) sounded mouth watering, but when it arrived it was mainly breading covering a small chile, stuffed only with plain cheese. For that price???     If all you want is a drink, sure, go here. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Tried the place yesterday for the first time. The chips were nice and warm but a little thick . I did l Not like their  hot sauce . It was a little  bitter and hot. We ordered  their guacamole  . It was nice and fresh  a little  expensive  . Had their  enchiladas with green chili. It was a little  dry . The food was good  UT on the expensive side . Services  were good"}
{"text":"Good food but the painfully slow service ruined the experience. Will not invest the time for a return visit. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Came here to try out a different Mexican restaurant then where I normally go, and this place was pretty good. I had the restaurants version of a Cadillac margarita to start with and it was a little too sweet for my liking. We had complimentary chips and salsa. Chips were nice and warm, salsa had a good smoker flavor. I ordered the combination fajitas. The steak had a great flavor while the chicken could use more. My boyfriend he the enchiladas and he seemed to be enjoying them. We heard about the Mexican skillet brownie, but didn't have enough room to try last night. I think I'll substitute my drink for dessert next time. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I can sum up this review with this:  An alcohol-free lunch for two at a Mexican restaurant that costs $45 better have me saying, \"Holy crap that was good, I can't wait to go back!\"  Not so at Cantina Laredo.  They tout \"gourmet Mexican food\".  And while some of the entree's looked interesting, and I suppose \"gourmetish\", I was basically unimpressed.  The table-side prepared guacamole was very good, though $10 seems a bit pricey. It was nice and chunky, just how I like it (though the onions were TOO chunky for my taste. Unlike a previous reviewer noted, the jalapenos were diced to the perfect size).  Chips were excellent, and the salsas were quite tasty, but had absolutely no fire.  I ordered the Enchiladas de Mole, which were just OK. Not bad, not great. The \"Sweet, spicy blend of dried Mexican peppers\" made me think there would be some spice/fire to this dish, but again there was none. Flavorful, yes. Spicy, not-so-much. And there was something odd about the taste that we couldn't quite place. One of those dishes that I couldn't quite decide if I liked or not. It was almost as if the cook did something for the sole purpose of making it \"gourmet\".  My lovely bride ordered a combo plate that was anything but \"gourmet\". It was standard Mexican fare. Again, OK but not great by any stretch of the imagination (and available for half the price at any mom & pop type place on the planet).  The guy behind me ordered fajitas that smelled delightful. Then again, you can throw a hunk of any form of beef on a sizzling skillet and it'll smell delightful to me.   Service was very good. We were seated swiftly (the place was basically empty at noon, which doesn't bode well for their future) and the food came quickly. Our soda / tea / chips were never empty. Very attentive service, though not particularly friendly. Clearly not rude, just sort of \"there\".  This place looks like it might be fun to hang out and have drinks. A large (and apparently well stocked) bar is front and center. With margaritas pushing $12 a pop though, be sure to check your credit limit before leaving home.  In short, you can slap \"gourmet\" on the facade and on the menu. You can charge \"gourmet\" prices. But if you don't serve gourmet food, you wind up with a two star restaurant that I can't recommend...."}
{"text":"Everything about Cantina is amazing!  Service, food and drinks. We have been regulars since they opened!"}
{"text":"I was only here for drinks, but wow!  I don't even know what this drink was called- it was some sort of fruity margarita that came with a coconut popcicle.  A messy drink, to be sure, but delicious!  The outdoor seating area is beautiful on a nice night, and the service was great as well.  I'm looking forward to returning and trying the food!"}
{"text":"I really expected to like Cantina Laredo - upscale mexican food, darkly intimate interior, nice outdoor patio with a fire pit & lights, interesting menu options, and prices that would indicate good food. My issue with Cantina Laredo is their ingredients - everything in our meal came out of a can or a freezer bag which resulted in really stale food. I go out to eat to get food I can't make as well as home, but I'll settle for food that's as good as I make at home...Cantina Laredo couldn't even meet that. The dish concepts really sounded so good, if only they used fresh and good ingredients. We had:  - Chili con queso: I was expecting a queso fundido like dip but instead it was canned nacho cheese with a can of rotel diced tomato/chillis. This would be fine if it was HH & bar food & priced at something around $3...not appropriate to charge $8 for this crap. It really was bad canned nacho cheese. - Spinach Enchiladas: The spinach filling very clearly tasted like frozen spinach (without any fresh garlic or other flavors to dress it up) and the green bean vegetables on the side were very clearly frozen green beans (awful). The roasted poblano cream sauce just tasted like sour cream without any chili flavor. - Chicken Enchiladas: My boyfriend got this dish & enjoyed his enchiladas. However he had the same issue with the green beans, and the rice tasted like boxed rice from the grocery store (which isn't terrible but I would expect an upscale restaurant to do better). - Mango Margarita: Yummy. Easily the tastiest thing I had all night.  The atmosphere in Catina Laredo is nice & enjoyable, but the food is absolutely terrible and they charge way too much for it. Had their food even been average, I'm sure I would go back again, but their food was so bad that I'll never eat here again."}
{"text":"We hadn't been here for a couple of years. The couple we went with hadn't either. We were all a little disappointed. We remembered it fondly and it didn't meet our expectations. Time passes and things change...  The hostess was very friendly and helpful in getting us seated and equipped with menus. An assistant dropped chips and salsa immediately.   After a few minutes a waiter came by to ask if we had been helped and took drink orders when we said we had not. We then waited for what seemed like a long time for beverages, including water. After we received our table side guacamole, one friend asked for more chips. The waiter first moved my chips across the table but after that move we did get another basket. I ordered a glass of wine to go with my entree. It arrived several minutes late. In fairness to the waiter, I don't know if there was enough staff for the 40 or 50 diners who were seated in the half hour after we arrived. He did check on us after we got our food.  I ordered the dish I have ordered several times in the past ten years. It was \"hotter\" than in the past, hard to eat. One friend couldn't get through her meal due to heavy handed use of chiles. My wife wasn't impressed with her entree salad. The guacamole is always good. We didn't have dessert. I had the CasaRita and it was as good as I remembered.  The wine list isn't long but is adequate. Prices seem a little high but are not up too much and this is a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a review of the Happy Hour.  The Skinny: underseasoned and underwhelmed. Although they give you big portions, in this case, it isn't a good thing (2), service - stinks worse than the food (0) value: edible food but nothing spectacular, shoddy service makes this place a (2).  We came here to try their happy hour because we were enticed by their rather extensive half priced bar menu.  Normally when it comes to happy hours, we make it a point to sit at the bar because the bartender is right there offering you service. At this joint, the bartenders couldn't give a s&*t.  He barely acknowledged us as we sat down. After spending a good amount of time fetching 2 glasses of water (he was too busy flirting with 2 skanky looking chicks at the end of bar), he neglected to provide a menu. I had to sneak one away from our neighbour.   By the time he returned, we barraged him with our menu selections because we didn't know when he'd come back from infinity and beyond. Then he asked us \"are you sure you don't want a margarita?\".   Pet peeve rant. If I wanted a f&*king margarita I'd have ordered one. End of rant.  Realizing we weren't going to order booze, he pretty much ignored us. We had to ask for everything -- from more refills of water even when our empty glasses were in front of his face to f*&king cutlery. Don't even get me started on him lifting out heavy bins of dirty dishes and not washing his hands. Oh, and it took at least 10 minutes to find him to print out our check.  At one point, the bar was completely unmanned for at least 6 minutes. A bunch of servers were huddled around the drink order area, waiting for their drinks to be made. Yup, the bar area = major clusterf$&k. And lets face it... the restaurant was perhaps 25% capacity (maybe 40 customers) and that's being freaking generous.  The bartender actually had the gall to say just as he handed us our check which he finally got around to printing out. \"Sorry about the poor service tonight. We just got slammed.\" By whom, I wonder, because the joint wasn't even hopping.   In a way that was totally a dick move to try and garner sympathy. He knew that service was shoddy but didn't really acknowledge it until he realized that he was going to get a s*&tty tip. Sorry douche -- you still got a shitty tip anyway. He's lucky we left anything at all.  On to the food.We ordered the fish tacos (3 tacos, $13 regular price), the tacos al pastor ((3 tacos, $11 regular price), the steak flatbread (2 large portions, $11 regular price)  and the ahi tuna tacos (3 tacos, $9 regular price). Portion sizing in general for their bar menu is rather generous. However given the lower quality of their food, large amounts is not a boon at all.  We sampled their chips and salsa. Our server just plopped them on our table so I had no idea of what kind of salsa it was. The warm one is better than the cold one but neither one was truly worth mentioning. Their chips are on the thinner variety and needed some salt.  Ahi tuna tacos were pretty bad. The fish had a weird sweetness to it that was singularily unpleasant. Encased in a taco shell made soggy by the watery, flavourless, green slime masquerading as guacamole, I believe this was definitely the worst dish of the night.  The fish tacos had a very skimpy portion of fish in it. Or maybe because there are too many freaking slices of red raw onion to actually identify that there's some underseasoned fish hiding in there. Texturally uninteresting, it definitely needed more cabbage to add some crunch. It was just terribly bland and not very interesting dish.  Tacos al pastor are not legit. It looks like chunky, stewed upchuck instead of the roasted pork on a spit. If that wasn't bad enough, the pork was as desperately flavourless as the fish tacos. Mixing in the grilled pineapple wasn't going to save it. It was pretty mediocre.  The flatbread de bistek was the only thing that was truly palatable that night. The steak actually was seasoned and the flatbread was crisp - almost like a thicker cracker. It definitely wasn't anything astounding but at least it was okay. But as finger food, it's really messy to eat without a knife and fork.   Overall, given the s*(tty service and the \"okay to the-verge-of-nasty\" food, I have no inclination to return. I was seriously debating about given this place a 1 star review. However the food was bad but wasn't completely inedible. For that, this joint squeeks by with a 2 starred review."}
{"text":"Great happy hour... Even on Saturdays! My favorite here is the Ahi Tacos!!!! The Chocolate Brownie Dessert is rich in flavor! It's one of my all time picks for \"modern Mexican\" food in the Summerlin area!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour is a great way to try a variety of appetizers. My husband and I did not expect the large portions of high quality Mexican fair. We had planned to sit at the bar first for a sampling of food and drink but ended up quite full after just 2 apptzrs each. I was very impressed with taste, portions, presentation and creative twists on traditional Mexican food. I was pleased that they allow you to mix it up on the taco plate that comes with three tacos; For example you may choose chicken, carne asada, and carnitis-my favorite. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Still on my quest to find good mexican foods in this area. Ordered the 2 kinds of salsas, salty and saltier. the Guacamole could have used some of the salt from the salsa, the enchiladas went in the trash (ordered out) as they were tortilla wrapped spinach covered in some cream cheese with 3 mushrooms. I asked for beans and rice, got zucchini and rice. ceviche was fish scented lemon juice (way over powering) guacamole lacked seasoning and spiciness, the taco was on the guacamole so it was wet. I am not ranking the service or the restaurant as I did not eat there. But I do not think the food would of been any different. Basically, after tasting everything... I had chips for dinner,which to my sadness (at what they charged for them) were not home aid (even chevys does that) . My daughter did not eat hers either... and my hubby. well he was in the military... he'll eat mres. Most of the people who wrote good reviews on here, I noticed were AFTER a few margaritas."}
{"text":"This place was solid. Technique was okay.   The interior was hip and vibrant. The drinks were strong and good. Nice and clean.   The guacamole was okay. Not the best I've ever had, but certainly not the worst.   I orders the chicken taco. It was fairly salty. Like I needed extra water salty. The meat was a little over cooked.   If you're hungry this will get the job done. Very attentive service."}
{"text":"This place seems a bit inconsistent. On our first visit I ordered the tacos de pollo and they weren't spectacular but certainly tasted and looked fresh! I asked that my margarita be made with less of the sugar syrup and they were unable to do that since their margarita mix (both blended and on the rocks) are pre-made.   On our second visit I ordered the tacos de fajita and the beef was extremely overdone and difficult to chew! The other two people in my group also ordered beef dishes and felt the beef was over-cooked as well. Same deal with the margarita - extremely over sweetened.   The place is clean, the staff is nice, and the menu is fairly extensive but I am positive there is better Mexican food somewhere in the area."}
{"text":"Yuck! Ordered the fajita tres the chicken and beef were flavorless, the bacon wrapped shrimp was flavorful but they left a toothpick inside the shrimp so when I bit into it ouch. It comes with rice which tasted like tomato sauce and rice. The sides of guacamole, sour cream, and pico de gallo sat on the fajita plate and continued to cook. I burnt my tongue on the guacamole. I don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"Should have known not to expect an authentic meal when gourmet is included in the restaurants name.   How in the world is this place rated as high as it is??  Cooking Mexican food and knowing what it tastes like, this place is a slap in the face for Mexican food.   The variety I am used to is non existent here.  Only noticed caucasian servers, patrons, honestly felt out of place.    The menu is short and odd.  Nothing traditional about this place.  I ordered the chicken mole enchiladas and I was so disappointed, the sauce was bland no cheese in enchiladas, the tortillas where not cooked (maybe because our meal came out in less than five minutes after we ordered it).  I knew I would be disappointed by the answers the waiter gave me when I asked about the menu. The chicken tasted like cosco canned chicken.  Best thing here was the iced water with lemon.  Giving it two stars because the waiter tried to sell it I just wasn't buying it."}
{"text":"First time to visit, Saturday around 12:30. Not very busy. Waiter Ray.  Ordered an appetizer of ceviche, a beer and a blood orange sangria, which was great!  After about 20 mins, the waiter finally realized we never received our app.  He then tells us they are all out.  Our chips and salsa had been eaten...he took the chips to refill but not the salsa.  Finally got more salsa.  I ordered the beef stew which is a new item and my husband ordered the shrimp salad.  His salad was very good with great flavor.  The mango dressing was very tasty. The taste of the stew was very good but when I finally tossed the stew around abit I only found 1  - 1/4\" x 1/4\" piece of beef.  For the price it should have been more.  Brought the waiter over and he got me more which was better beef than the piece that was in there.   For our first visit, it won't be some place we would return to.  Flavor was good, sangria was good. Maybe Just an off day but there are many restaurants to choose from.  We'll stick with Brio or try our luck at Echo and Rig."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite taco places in the Valley! The happy hour is awesome because 3 small tacos of your choice is about $6. The margaritas are excellent as well! My favorite taco there is the fajita.:) Also, their chips are always warm and comes with cold and hot salsa."}
{"text":"Really authentic, fresh carne asana and fish tacos. Friendly and unpretentious. Great value. Only one server on a busy weeknight  was the only slight negative ."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times and only have positive things to say about it.  First off, the service is top notch.  Its so good that you barely notice it.  Why? Because everything is perfect on the first try!  The food is great.  Constantly great.  Awesome drinks.  A great time on Cinco De Mayo.    The environment is also nice for carrying a conversation (it is on the quieter side)"}
{"text":"Great service and good food. Fajitas tres was yummy, but chicken enchiladas with spinach was the best. A must try.  a great time over all. Thank you for a fun time."}
{"text":"One of the best places I have found so far in Arizona!  We have been here a few times and it has always been good. I highly recommend it!  The chips and salsa are really good also!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant of ALL time! I literally go here for my Birthday, Mother's Day, any day that I get to choose the place to celebrate I choose this place. On top of that I probably come here 3 times or more a month just because! If it was closer that number would definitely be higher!   Each and every time I have been I have tried something new on the menu and I've tried more than half of the menu so far and have not been disappointed by anything. I have also tried almost all of the margarita's and they are amazing to say the least!  On top of that the Server's are ALWAYS fantastic and they make you feel like family! I continue to recommend this place to EVERYONE!    Just typing this review makes me think YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Just about every year I go here I feel like they have cutten back. When I first went there everything was fresh and tasty. Then I went there a year later and got the same thing and it wasn't that fresh. The only thing that was and has been was the Guacamole that they made infront of you. Then I cam here the third year, Fall of  2012 and the food wasn't that fresh the Guacamole was alright and the meal I have wasn't good. The next expierence I had was February I got the chicken Enchiladas with white sauce and had to say it wasn't very good. The sauce wasn't very good it had too much chicken in it and was too big, even the Guacamole this visit wasn't nearly as fresh as it use to be. One month later I came the Saint Patrick's Day weekend and I had to say worse expierence I've had . They didn't have much of a menu, the food wasn't that good and and not much of a good taste, again. The waitress was alright but I've had a little better there. After, we ate I wanted some dessert so I received the menu and it was very very limited, had only a few things on it that weren't very good and cut off a lot of stuff of the menu! My 5th visit a month before for dessert I had icecream in a churro like bowl and fruit, this past time they didn't have that. While I was there I picked the fried brownie and ice cream dish fried in scotch butter and had to say it was just gross, very plain, too rich and small amount. I was very disappointed that last visit and if I went again anyway it would never be the same."}
{"text":"I've not dined here, but enjoyed their catered food at a dinner party last weekend! Two kinds of fajitas, warm chips, fresh guacamole, queso... everything was DELICIOUS!   The serving staff appeared professional and pleasant, making the dinner party both elegant and enjoyable for everyone, including the hosts! We had a great time!  Will definitely make the drive outside of our regular dining areas to enjoy this food again!"}
{"text":"We were in town over the weekend for the festival and after a late start on Sunday, we stopped at Cantina Laredo for brunch.  Service was top notch - they seemed very busy but the staff handled it well. Having worked customer service jobs for well over a decade, it's nice to see a staff handle high volume with so much professionalism.   The food was great - I had chorizo con huevos and my husband had the chilaquiles. The food was more than enough - I didn't even finish my plate. My only complaint is that the dish included jalapeños and that was heartburn city for the expecting mama. That is no fault of the staff - they prepared the dish as it should've been - but it would've been nice for the menu to state that. I understand it's a chain restaurant though, and that there isn't any way for local staff to change that. My husbands eggs were cooked perfectly and he devoured the whole dish.   Our drinks came pretty quickly - I just ordered OJ since I can't drink right now. He had a mimosa. They took a few minutes but, when it's busy, that's to be expected. My request for a non-alcoholic brunch drink were accommodated without question and delivered correctly, which I appreciate.  With the exception of the omission of jalapeños from the menu (and the subsequent heartburn), we had a wonderful experience! Kudos to your management for training their staff to handle high volume well - it's something we see less and less of when we dine out!"}
{"text":"Hands down our favorite Mexican food in Vegas.  The menu is full of unique and creative dishes.  The Chipotle Chicken Fajitas are my absolute favorite.  Awesome guac and salsa.  And my wife loves the cocktails.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Started with the guacamole made fresh at the table, which was excellent. For my entree I ordered the fish tacos, which were  decent but the sauce could have used a little kick.   Service was great, Favio was friendly and always there when we needed another drink."}
{"text":"I love Cantina Laredo!  Great for lunch or dinner.  Get the guacamole made at your table, sooo yummy!  My favorite dish is the chicken mole enchilada. If you have never tried mole, this is the place to do it.  It is so rich with flavor.  I tried something else once and it didn't even compare to the mole enchiladas, so I pretty much just stick to that dish every time.  They also have a great Sunday brunch menu, but I never get up early enough to try it out!  The margaritas are STRONG, I get pretty happy with just one.  They also serve warm(as in temperature)  and cold salsa with the chips.  They both are fantastic.   One funny thing I noticed, every waiter/waitress I've ever had has an accent.  Either they only hire Spanish speaking people or they tell them all to fake an accent so the place feels more authentic!  Oh, I almost forgot... They have this amazing desert.  I don't know what it's called, but it has the most enticing smell.  It's some kinda sizzling cake, cinnamon ice cream, brandy butter goodness. Try it, you'll die!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come in here for a while. Unfortunately my experienced sucked pretty bad. We came in at about 1:30 pm. It took a few minutes before anyone noticed us waiting to be seated. The interior design is boring. My food was god awful disgusting. I ordered a quesadilla chicken thing but it looked like dog shit on a triscuit. Some genius thought it would be a good idea to smear beans and cheese on a pita chip and stick a generic piece of chicken from a bag that they bought at walmart and call it a lunch special. It was luke warm barf and whoever came up with it should be fired. Our chips were also more gritty than other mexican places and the salsa was mediocre. My experience wasn't good but my friends ceviche looked and tasted good.  Our margaritas were not good at all. Our waitress was very friendly but never brought us napkins or silverwear. About 5 minutes after our dishes arrived i went and grabbed the table settings off of an empty table. Since I returned most of my meal they took it off of the bill. I feel like it's probably better here at night and maybe I ordered the wrong thing but what I ordered should never be on any menu. I won't be back. We went to hussongs after this and had great food and drinks."}
{"text":"To conclude our day date on Sunday, after we left Fox Cigar Bar we went to Cantina Laredo for an early dinner.  I had eaten at the Scottsdale location twice last year for lunch and enjoyed it then, so I thought I would take the husband to the Gilbert location and see what happy hour and dinner was like.    We were greeted right away by a manager type and he seated us and said our server, I believe her name was Jackie, would be right with us, and she was.  She showed us the HH menu and we opted for the $5 marg.  They also have $3 HH margs, but we're no pansies and wanted the bigger one.  We also ordered some chicken taquitos that are on the HH menu.  We got 6 for $3.49.  I thought that was a great deal.   They were flavorful with a nice crunch and the chicken was very tender.  In fact, I'm going to daydream about those for a minute.  Then we decided to share the Asada Y Camarones which is, to quote the menu:  grilled steak topped with bacon-wrapped shrimp filled with oaxaca cheese and jalapeno.  For $23.99 it was a great price and portion to share.  We each felt like we had a full dinner.  The steak was tender with a little pink inside, just like we like it, and those bacon-wrapped shrimp were heavenly.  They had a smoky flavor already and then the bacon on top of that....well, bacon makes everything better.  Our dinner came with some rice and sauteed squash.  Both nice and light.    How could I forget the chips and salsa?  I love that they bring you two salsas and one is more fire-roasted tasting and a little spicier.  Like them both a lot.  I ended up putting the smoky, spicier one on those taquitos and was in my own little heaven.      Jackie was very attentive and overall we had a great experience and look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Beautiful place, mediocre food.  Frustrating since I drive past it every week wishing we had a great mexican place in the neighborhood.  Nearby Juan Jaime's is better and cheaper with 1/10th the attitude."}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo had a nice setting, with outdoor seating to people watch and our waitress was very pleasant and on point. That's why the two stars. However, we were not a fan of the food at all. The food was luke warm upon arrival. Some of the food was spicy without warning. The flavors were bland and lacked flavor. I guess to new age Mexican for us. We prefer the real deal mom & pop Mexican style restaurants where the flavors are right on and you get fresh chips when you order two dips."}
{"text":"This is one of the nicer Mexican restaurants I've been to and I was glad they take reservations because we were coming with a large group of co-workers to celebrate some birthdays. It was a Sunday night and when I arrived they had 2 large tables set up for our group, although the rest of the restaurant was pretty empty.  We had some margaritas, that were alright so I mostly opted for Dos Equis Amber drafts, which was served in tall skinny glasses. We ordered a few appetizers to share: queso dip and tableside guacamole, which was pretty cool since you got to see the waitress making a fresh batch for you. Everyone got various different entrees and I wasn't able to try them all but the quesadillas and tacos were tasty, as well as the tres leches cake for dessert. We told the waitress we were celebrating birthdays and she brought out brownies with burning sparklers so we could sing to our birthday peeps, which I thought was really nice of them.  I think we were there pretty close to closing time because service was a little slow and we only had 1 waitress despite having a group of about 15 people. In the end, we had a great time and the food was excellent, just took us a few hours to dine because everything seemed to move so slow...at least they didn't kick us out! We ended up leaving after 11 pm when their closing time was 10!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance and the service. Waiters and waitresses are sweet and attentive. The food, well, small portions for a higher price point, but I'm a farm girl from Oregon, so I make that comment often."}
{"text":"Very good margaritas (although tough to discern quality after your first one is down the hatch) and pretty nice guacamole... sorry, but I make it better. The first time I went to this place, I felt it was an amazing experience, and by far the best chicken tortilla soup I have ever had, followed by one of the best carne asada plates I have ever had as well. So I recommend it for a business outing, which gets everyone excited. Drinks are fine, orders are taken and the guacamole begins to get prepared table side. As soon as we begin to dive into the guac, the soup arrives. One of our guests was in the restroom, and his soup was served while he was away. BAD, BAD waiter. Hot, cold, warm dish... whatever, you do not serve an empty seat.   While enjoying our soup, entrees come out and were placed right next to our arms on sizzling hot plates. No one was even half way through their soup. I was furious and felt obligated to quickly shovel my soup so I could bring the dinner plate to my front and eat.   Our waiter came over to clear the soup bowls and asked how dinner was and if he could bring anything. \"How about desert right now\" I remarked, and unfortunately, he did not get the sarcasm.   Food = 4 stars  Service = 0 stars"}
{"text":"Some dishes are a complete hit and some are a complete miss but that's my taste. The service is always great, the bartenders are excellent at explaining their cocktail selections and I love their chips and salsa."}
{"text":"This place was great! I usually don't like going to \"high end\" mexican restaurants because I find most dishes taste very similar at regular mexican joints for less... However this place had some great flavor and good service! Everyone at the table enjoyed their meals.. The food was hot, fresh, and delicious!"}
{"text":"Service was good,  but the food was horrible.  I'm Mexican and this was not good Mexican food at all...most of the food seemed like it came from a can and the tortillas were most likely store bought. I will never come back."}
{"text":"This is a great Mexican food restaurant. I eat here for lunch once a week and have never had a bad meal. The \"Asada y Enchilada\" is my favorite dish. If you are an avocado lover like me,  this is the place to go. I always order extra avocado because they have the best and ripest avocados I have had anywhere."}
{"text":"I was super excited to celebrate Cinco de Mayo here!! We had head about some specials they were having for the weekend and the one that made my mouth water was the Pop a Rita! I margarita with a Popsicle... Umm yes please! $5 for the Cinco de Mayo specials... Absolutely!! I read that the specials were only available on the patio, that's cool, I love sitting on the patio.   When I got there I put our name on the wait list for the patio and was told 20 minutes. It was only about 15 mixtures. We were a party of three were she sat us at a table barely set, and for only two people at that. 'Oh, there's there?' Umm yep, told you three and three of us walked out together.   They had a mariachi band playing when we sat down which was awesome entertainment for the day! We waited what seemed to be forever for a server to acknowledge us. I later learned the server that walked by us several times and ignored us ended up be our server. Ugh, you couldn't have said 'Be with you in a minute'? Serving 101.   Anyway, he did warn us the bar was running slow, no biggie, we enjoyed each other's company, until he completely lacked on his job. I was so irritated! Slow, un-personable, when he finally came to get our food order he literally just came to the table and waited for us to say something. Uh 'Hi are you ready, what can I get you, what looks good' would have all been acceptable things to say. To be fair, it wasn't entirely his fault, he seemed to be the only server on the patio!! HELLO!!! You offered patio specials for Cinco de Mayo weekend!! Staff up!!! But he could have totally made the best of it and get our asses drunk and no one would have cared his service sucked! Pretty sure we were to get chips and salsa, well we didn't so I couldn't tell you how those would have been.   So the three stars are for the food and value. The food was really good! Warm and cold quickly, but it was still good. They have several enchilada options that are \"healthier\" options, I couldn't decide which I wanted to try! I had an artichoke and avocado enchilada! Yum! It made great leftovers, which I love!! And the prices are pretty reasonable.   I would try this again, maybe for their happy hour specials, which look pretty good. But from my experience and obviously other Yelpers, my service standards will need to be lowered in order to enjoy myself. We'll see if I can actually do that."}
{"text":"So, I went here the first time like 2 and a half yrs ago. I really liked it, so I decided to go there when someone gave me a gift certificate there.  I ordered a burrito and my girlfriend ordered a grilled chicken breast.  She was eating it and was like this taste soo bad. I was like let me try!  I took one bite and the chicken tasted soo badly of fish it was soo gross.  Why would the chicken taste like fish?!?!  Well needless to say she got food poisoning and had to miss work for the next day.  Although they do have a tranny that works there and she is really nice. We always get her as our server and she gave us the \"family \"discount when we came.  But, I wont eat there again"}
{"text":"Ya know what makes a great meal? A great server! Our party of 3 was new to this \"Gourmet Mexican Food\" location, so we had questions. Plus, we knew we wanted antojitos, platos de carne, y postres........we needed the option to SHARE so many plates :() Our server, Durango, made it happen! He was ready with all the answers, was alerted to and wary of my peanut allergy, and set up all plates to share effortlessly....platters, large plates, side plates....perfect! To be fair, if the food hadn't been good, I probably would have written about the service anyway. But, the food was fabulous, so double score!! We had chili con queso, chicken enchiladas, machaca tacos, and then there was dessert........a warm, almost on the under-baked-side-which-is-so-sinful-walnut-brownie that was served with vanilla ice cream and Mexican brandy butter sauce. Delish & delightful - a great find while on our mini vacation in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"The food is good, and the so is the service.  The bartenders are excellent, both in making drinks and small-talk while you hang out.  It's one of my favorite spots for lunch - alone at the bar or business meetings at the table.    Prices are reasonable and the food is tasty."}
{"text":"Went to this place last night with a party of 7. Told the waitress at the very beginning that we would need separate checks. Food very average I thought. Service was not good at all. One person had to send his carnitas tacos back two times and decided he had lost his appetite. After asking for our check so we could leave, it took 45 minutes to get our checks which two were not correct. When we received our checks, they had the nerve to automatically add 20% tip. This waitress did NOT deserve a 20% tip. I have never seen anything more than 18% added and I think that is very high as well. It is not required by law to leave any certain amount of a tip so how is it that they can get away with adding an automatic 20%. Very disappointing and I will never go back. Food = not good. Service = terrible. Automatic 20% to someone who didn't deserve it = BULLSHIT!"}
{"text":"Fajita Tres, bacon wrapped shrimp, spicy salsa, perfect margarita, and little chemistry = best date spot!"}
{"text":"Got dragged here again for a family dinner....again. :-/  No hostess at the stand, we waited about 5 minutes for her to show up. Not a big wait or anything but on a Friday night, I would think they would have backup staff.  While walking to the table, we passed a large section (the middle of the restaurant) that had the lights dimmed. It's obvious that they don't have enough of a crowd to use all their available space. It looked like they only had 2 waiters and 2 bus boys working the open section of tables and all the staff looked stressed out and weren't very friendly.   We got table side guacamole...again. I wasn't excited about getting it again but others in my group wanted it. It was a ton better than last time but it still wasn't all that great. You're paying over 10 bucks for 3 avocado halfs but at least this time, they were smart enough to bring out their \"herbs and spices\" out in little bowls rather than bringing the store bought packet out :P There was no zing to it though :(  I got pork tacos which weren't bad (seriously guys, could adding a little zing kill ya??) but for goodness sake, why is a place that charges $20/plate using crappy boxed rice with dehydrated peas? And why can't they cook the rice completely? Second time dealing with the crappy boxed rice, second time dealing with hard partially cooked rice. I could just call it a crappy white washed Mexican food experience but that wouldn't do justice to just how awful their rice is.   Again, I left so disappointed. Thank goodness Habenero's (ya know, REAL Mexican food?) is close by AND has great food!  ;-)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times the food was phenomenal.  The only reason that I'm not giving it a big whoppin 5 stars is because of the wait staff.    The first time that we went we had a waiter that almost seemed like he was afraid of us.  When we spoke to him he took a step backwards.... very odd.  And the second time.... was interesting to say the very very least.  Our waiter supposedly was experiencing some \"marital problems\" and was totally blitzed.  He couldn't get our order right, his eyes were glazed over and (here's the kicker) he ran his fingers through my husband's hair!  We alerted the manager out of concern for the waiter- was he drunk?  Did he mix meds?  Is he having a meltdown?  He was sent home and we received two impressive complimentary desserts.    The food makes up for that crazy experience though.... and I doubt that waiter works there anymore.  After all that the manager kept checking in on us and the food is so amazing that it hardly matters.  The food is beautiful and so delish..... as are the desserts which are prepared tableside.  Will definitely be back- we'll just hope for a sober waiter."}
{"text":"You have to go once for the guacamole. Once might be enough, it's a little overpriced and wasn't super impressed with the other dishes I tried. It has a fun atmosphere and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time. I went last night and it was the first time I had been in months, I Sat at the bar with 2 friends. The bartender(a girl) made a very good margarita! I'm not one to do a lot of bad reviews but when service is bad I get really annoyed! We had the guacamole and that's was just ok, I don't think we finished half. I ordered the sea bass ceviche! It was PROBABLY THE MOST FISHIEST FISH I HAVE EVER HAD! It tasted AWFUL! I told the male bartender and his response to me is- its sea bass it's supposed to be fishy! You don't like it? He takes it back to the kitchen and comes back out and says your right it is fishy! Duh. The chef or manager to must've tasted it and agreed. He shouldn't have made any comments to me about it to begin with. He asked if I wanted something else but I was so disgusted by that fish my appetite was done. My friend said she could even smell how fishy it was. So gross"}
{"text":"We love this place! Been coming here for years. Great food and great drinks! Amazing happy hour specials! We love to come here for Sunday brunch. The crab cakes Benedict are DELICIOUS! Eddie and Alejandra are our favorite. Always Great service."}
{"text":"Had a reservation for Xmas eve for 8 people. I called to confirm the Friday before & the restaurant called me the day of. When we got there they wanted to split the party of 8 onto two tables! The hostess said I'm sorry the tables are bolted down we can't put two together! The place was almost empty and you can't sit my party @ one table? I asked for a manager who was of no help simply stating we have a large table that's just about to get up would you like that? Yes thank you Mr bald headed manager I would like it as I have 8 people I would like to sit at one table. We waited another 10 for the table to clear then get reset. Then we sat and sat waiting I swear another 10 minutes for Caesar our server to greet us. I would have thought Mr Mgr would have been on it offering us an apology or some great service but no. Drinks took forever, screwed up the margarita because we said no salt so it kept getting worse. I ordered the $23 fajitas which came out on a warm cast iron plate on a wood trivet, every body's food was warm not hot. I will give credit to the taste of the food as I did like it, just wished it was hot. The server tried his best but it just didn't work. I wish them luck. Thanks for nothing I won't be back"}
{"text":"Not so good.  I admitt I came here for cinco de mayo so it was quite busy.  The service was good for it being a holiday , but the food was not good at all. It is was very bland and had no taste to it. I got the ahi tuna tacos and everyone recommended it.  I am a big tuna fan and this didn't hit the spot.  I thought it would be better from what people said.   The margarita was so..I couldn't even finish it.   Not a fan.   It  was my first time here and I don't think I'll choose to come again."}
{"text":"Guiso de Pollo is the chicken and tomatillo stew. It is a gluten free option of which there are many here. The chips they serve are corn based and also GF. The prices are very moderate and range from 15-30 dollars. I got what I expected from Cantina Laredo. The food was well made, reasonably priced and there is a wide selection of menu choices. You will certainly find the typical Mexican fare, but also some unique dishes that add some variety. My server, Ryan did a nice job of making sure my experience was a positive one."}
{"text":"Great addition to Summerlin!   Tasty food, friendly staff, awesome ambiance and good happy hour!  I will be back many, many times!   Best guac everrrr."}
{"text":"Great American Mexican food. They use fresh Ingredients and interesting ways of presenting the food. Also the black bean side dish was really good."}
{"text":"Love their Tex Mex style menu. Chicken chipotle is awesome! Great service and food is consistently good. Highly reccomended..."}
{"text":"Was not impressed the choices  and pricing.  North Scottsdale Mexican  food. Don't go out of your way to come here"}
{"text":"Excellent value for Happy Hour.  We went on a Monday and had $5 House Margaritas which were really good and split (3) appetizers all half price.  I highly recommend the tuna tacos and the steak fajita tacos. They are small street size tacos but really filling.  The salsa is so good even my 5 year daughter loved it.  Cant' wait to go back when it's cooler and sit on the awesome patio."}
{"text":"I visited Cantina Laredo for a Sunday Brunch and I have yet to get it off my mind! I have only been one time but I will definately be going back. I had a dish with eggs and carne asada. What made it so rememberable was this sauce they put on the carne asada that just made it all melt together and filled your mouth with flavor! It was like a cilantro pesto type sauce. Their drinks were also delicious. I will definately come back for brunch and maybe even a lunch or two."}
{"text":"Definitely a subpar experience. It was our server who came to seat us, but there was no smile, no introduction, no welcome whatsoever. Dumped our menus on the table and walked off. Throughout the whole lunch, we felt so uncomfortable with his obvious unhappiness to be working there. He kept slamming things on the table, talking hurriedly, and looking angry. I wish I looked at his name on the check, too bad. Anyways, the food itself was also below average. The ceviche had about 4 chunks of sea bass in it and also had celery in it, which was very strange. The guacamole was decent. I got the tacos de pollo, which were actually pretty good. The Spanish rice was very flavorful also. My friend got the Camarones Escondidos, which was supposed to be chicken stuffed with shrimp with a chipotle wine sauce. They literally cut the chicken in half, put a few pieces of shrimp in it, and closed the chicken (see photo). It might be just me, but it was weird. Overall, bad service and okay food. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I have been to Cantina Laredo probably 15 times in the past 5 years and went today for lunch.   I had not been for a while so I was excited to go back.  I don't think I will be coming back, today was a huge disappointment.   Normally they bring you two types of salsa for your chips and they only brought out one kind today.  I asked our server about the other kind of salsa and she said she would bring it out and never did.  The draft beer was down so they brought out bottles with tall glasses to pour the beer into and the glasses were dirty and not cold.  The food was just average and was better in the past.  The server was not very on the ball either.     This place used to be great and it has turned into less than mediocre.   Go to Barrio Queen or somewhere else for better food and experience."}
{"text":"Unimpressed. It's very pretty and has an interesting menu to read but for the prices charged, I was very disappointed in the lack of FLAVOR in the dishes. The only thing that was even remotely interesting was the salsa served with the chips. As an Arizonan, it's by default that we eat a lot of Mexican food. I've had way better. It's too high priced for the lack of flavor."}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo is a huge, nicely decorated restaurant. This was my first time dining on a Sunday. My guest enjoyed the fact that the brunch options were served with a complementary mimosa or \"Bloody Maria.\" He ordered the crab cakes which were served with eggs, potatoes, and a cinnamon fried tortilla bowl filled with fresh fruit. He thoroughly enjoyed his meal. I had the cheese enchiladas, which were amazing. The types of cheeses they used (not sure the names?) made these the best cheese enchiladas I've ever tasted. My entree was served with rice and pinto beans. My other guest enjoyed the carnitas, which was pork shanks served with rice and zucchini. We all enjoyed the chips and salsa. The salsas were unique. One was served warm and the other was served cold. They were both yummy. The desserts looked delicious but we were too full to partake in them.  We will definitely return to Cantina Laredo."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday 03/23/14 at 2:30 PM and it was 72 degrees.  Sat outside on the side patio in the back.  Had tons of mimosas and the chilaquiles.  The chilaquiles come w/chicken.  It was good.  Love the mexican brownie and did not love the mango tres leche.  I normally love mango but would have preferred plain tres leche cake."}
{"text":"Sure, there are new players in the Gilbert Market that offer Latin American specialties, but I would crown Cantina Laredo as \" queen\" of service and experience.  You don't need to travel into the barrio to have your tastebuds satisfied.  Guess what, the wait is about 200% less than that place in downtown Gilbert.  Skip the hype and head to Cantina Laredo for a most enjoyable time."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times and never had a poor experience. If you want to splurge a little bit on an appetizer, try the guacamole dish! They come to your table and make it all right in front of you and is quite a spectacle to watch. I have had The enchiladas, steak burritos, carne Asada, tamales, and the chips with salsa and Guacamole and have enjoyed everything I've ordered. They have several gluten-free options if you have dietary restrictions like my wife and I are very accommodating in that respect. The service is always good in time to receive our food is satisfactory. We always have a good and relaxing meal each time we visit and will definitely return."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places for Mexican cuisine. We went at lunch time and sat on their lovely patio. The skinny margaritas are perfect - not too sweet - and tableside guacamole is very good and made to order. Their chips and salsa are very tasty. One of the salsas has a cumin flavor that I love. Entree salad was flavorful. Service was excellent. Atmosphere wonderful. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went with a large group to celebrate a graduation and they were extremely accommodating. We had an outside area to ourselves. I got the carnitas and they were cooked perfectly. The pork was falling off the bone. The sauce on top was a little heavy and it overpowered a lot of the meal for me. The chips and guacamole before the meal were good but nothing to rave about. The service was great and we never lacked anything. Overall the meal was good. I can't speak for the price because I didn't pay."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time tonight and it was excellent!  Arrived at 5pm on a Friday and happy hour seating was full but we got a booth in about 20 minutes.   Our server, Jackie, was awesome.  Very friendly and attentive.  We ordered the house margarita and it was excellent and house wine which was as expected for house wine.  Chips and salsa were great and our happy hour plates were very good and excellent prices.  I loved the vibe of the place, the quality of the food and that happy hour even on Friday was until 7pm.  By 6pm it was definitely full and people were waiting for bar seating so the later happy hour time is much appreciated for people who have jobs that do not allow an earlier happy hour.   Even when full it was not so noisy that you could not talk with your spouse or table of friends.   We will not only be back for happy hour but will be back for dinner."}
{"text":"This may have been our weirdest service experience ever.  Before we get to that, let's talk about the food. My husband ordered the tacos al carbon ($20). The taste was good but not traditional and they were served on flour tortillas. I had the fajitas tres with chicken, steak and bacon wrapped shrimp, which were recommended by the waitress. ($24). The bacon wrapped shrimp was delicious. The other items were also good but not memorable. We also had table side guac as a starter ($12).   Now I'm going to backup up and talk about the service. When we sat down the waitress asked us if we wanted drinks. We both wanted water to start. When she delivered the water she dropped them off fairly rapidly and moved on. Upon taking a sip, my husband asked how my water tasted, which was fine. He had me taste his and it was soda water. Odd...  On her return she gave him a new water per our request and took our drink order. We ordered one diet soda and table side guacamole. When she returned she brought him iced tea. Okay - double weird. Then she began to make the guac. We asked for lime and onions on the side, which she did for us (she was consistently friendly). What we got from our table side was 2 avocados halves mashed up with a dollop of tomatoes on top. That's it. We saw cilantro on her cart but there wasn't any in the guac and the only tomatoes were the dollop. Pretty weird and expensive guac even with the onions and lime on the side.   While she was making the guacamole I asked her about the fajitas tres, which she said  as her favorite. After dropping off the guac she walked away. We saw her take orders at the next table. Later she dropped off my meal -without ever taking my husbands the order! The weirdness continued with people picking up one of the two different salsas they serve without asking, but not replacing it. When our waitress did replace it, she gave us the wrong one.   We could go on but suffice it to say it was weird, especially for a higher end restaurant. So to sum it up - the food was good but expensive for the service we received and the weird guacamole. Will we be back....that remains to be seen, but my guess is no."}
{"text":"I have never fully appreciated nouveau cuisine. It has always left me a little hungry and a few Benjamins short. LOL   Our introduction to Cantina Laredo was somewhat inauspicious, since they misplaced our reservations on a busy Friday night.    We also had the same experience with the hostesses that fellow Yelp'er Teehee wrote about.  But in end, we had a nice evening, with our bill coming in at the low end.    After the confusion and a five minute wait, we were seated near the patio. It was a nice location and we had the added bonus of observing a pre-wedding family dinner of eighteen.   Cantina Laredo likes to market itself as serving \"modern Mexican food in a sophisticated, vibrant atmosphere. ... with a Mexico City style menu.\"  I believe it's more Mexican petite nouveau cuisine.   We started off with a delivery of chips and two types of salsa. The milder version had a nice tomato base. But it was the spicier one, with fire roasted peppers that was the standout. It was complex and so delicious, that you could have eaten it with a spoon.   Next was their table-side guacamole making called Top Shelf for $9.99. It was an exquisite. Now I make this all the time at home, yet it always seems tastier when someone else is doing it. LOL  Somewhere along the way our white honey sangria was dropped off. It was very good and fairly priced served in large 12 oz flute glass. Nice!  For dinner we decided to share two entrees. One was their Vera Cruz Enchiladas (photo), which was a nice mixture of spinach and chicken for $13.99; and the other was the Carnitas Tacos for $13.79.  The enchiladas had a nice flavor and kick. Both were very good, with the street tacos seeming deceptively small.   The bill came to about $30 a person including drinks, but before taxes and gratuities.   So Four Stars, and yes we are Fans of Cantina Laredo. While eating here might not get you a doggie bag for later, you will go home feeling as though you've enjoyed something special.  Remember to make reservations like we did! LOL"}
{"text":"Great place, friendly staff, really cheap but good food. Hot atmosphere. 100% recomended!"}
{"text":"I used to go to the Cantina Laredo at the Scottsdale Promenade for years until it unfortunately closed. I was thrilled to find out there was a CL's in Gilbert and tonight was my 5th trip here for dinner.  The food at Cantina Laredo has always been very good... a nice spin on traditional Mexican fare. Service at the Scottsdale location was a bit hit or miss... but so far the service at this San Tan Gilbert location has has been excellent every time. Disclaimer: I have never tried coming here for Mother's Day, Valentine's Day or other high volume times when finding good service anywhere is the exception. I almost always get the Cascabel Ribeye. It's an off menu special... but if you're a steak lover, I highly recommend asking for it. The aged ribeye cut is excellent and the cascabel marinade is delicious.   My girlfriend has tried a lot of different entrees which I often sample... and  neither of us have ever been disappointed. It's worth asking for the 2nd salsa when they serve chips... it now has to be requested. Both salsas are very good and complement each other.  The table-side guacamole and Mexican brownie sound a bit touristy but are actually very good. If only I could save space for the brownie dessert more often!"}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo was quite a surprise. We only chose to eat there, because we were close on time to see a movie across the street at The Suncoast & they took reservations. Walking in, I must have had a look on my face of a person who'd never seen a restaurant... but I was in a bit of awe, because the inside looked nothing like I pictured in my head. We both thought it was going to be small, dark & \"weird\"... the place is huge, light & airy. Very comfortable. Our waitress was awesome- genuinely pleasant & the perfect level of attentive, especially once we told her we were tight on time. The chips are amazing- very very thin. I'm not certain what the salsa is comprised of- there's a flavor I'm not normally a fan of- but, gosh, I went to town. The bestie got the mushroom enchiladas & I got a chicken with mushrooms & artichokes- portions were perfect, both dishes were refreshing & booming with flavor. Rather than beans & rice, our entrees came with thinly sliced & sauteed zucchini & rice. I devoured the veggies... the simplicity in flavor balanced the robust entree items & made the meal less bulky, like some Mexican food can be. Then we were off to see a movie! Helpful hint: whether eating at Tivoli or Boca Park, consider The Suncoast for seeing movies... no one is ever there! On a Friday/release day, we got right in with maybe 9 other parties in the theater with us. Anyway, give Cantina Laredo a shot- I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Loved the food but our table was right off the kitchen with horrible lighting. Just remove the table . I eyed an empty booth the whole time and it looked so cozy and warmly lit.  I had a Paloma, a delicious drink, with dinner. My chipotle chicken fajitas were delicious. The 3 enchilada plate was huge and tasty. All the food was substantial and good! We had a nice waiter and I would like to go back. I would skip the appetizer because the entrees are huge. Or......just go for appetizer, queso, and  a nice sangria or margarita!"}
{"text":"It's a must for reverse happy hour. Very cheap prices. I had the best time tonight with a group of five. Received our food very fast and the service was great. Thanks Josh you were awesome."}
{"text":"Love the decor. Wait staff are super. Wow, the ribeye steak was seasoned nicely and cooked perfectly. The chips and salsa were very nice. There are items they have not on the menu. Just ask your wait staff. Yes, ribeye is not on the menu. Amazing place. Soups are great and the presentation is wonderful."}
{"text":"Usually this place is awesome and we have no problems, but this time was different. :( We sat outside because it was a beautiful evening. First, they told us we couldn't get the fresh guac cart outside, so that was a bummer. Then, both of my parents ordered their meals without onions, and they both came completely loaded with onions. My mom sent her dish back and it came back with onions still on it. My dad wanted to order something else and asked for the menu and they never brought it out. My mom finally just ordered a different dish and it took forever to come out. By then my dad was practically filled up by their complimentary chips and salsa. I even had to wait quite a while just to get a refill on my water. My mom's third and final dish was good, but they forgot the queso it was supposed to come with. At that point we didn't even bother pointing it out. My boyfriend and I had already been done eating for 20+ minutes. Our food was good, and we ate it while it was still hot. The manager came by, but he basically just told us that the meal my dad had ordered earlier was prepped with onions prior to being cooked, so they couldn't take them out. One would think that if someone requests for their entire meal to have no onions that they would tell them that it already has onions in it that cannot be removed.? When my mom finally finished her meal, it took another 15 minutes for them to come back outside to check on us again and clear the table. After all of this, we still ended up having to pay $79. It even took forever for them to pickup the check so we could pay and leave. Hopefully next time we come in the food come out right the first time and the service will pick up some speed."}
{"text":"Even del taco  would taste better than this food. Our server was horrible. No common courtsey. Did not even refill my glass of water. He was only interested is offering high priced drinks.   Del carbon chicken was dry and bland. I hate paying $20 for a dish when it is no way worth it. Mt guest ordered fajitas and he said the same thing. Even the salsa served as starter with chips was bad.  This is a real bad food and for anyone who understand flavors and knows what good food is will agree.   This restaurant is off my list. Not going there again."}
{"text":"This place has a cool location and atmosphere. The food however food is over priced for the amount you get and the quality of food. The Spanish rice tasted like it was made from a cheap box from the grocery store. The customer service was great."}
{"text":"Coming from S. California you never know what you might encounter in Mexican food any place else. Cantina kept the wonderful true Mexican flavors and each dish was freshly prepared; accommodated the dietary needs of our electric group. I selected the vegetable fajitas with corn tortillas (gluten free option) and without any dairy (easily adapted for this vegan). This had the best and most unique assortment of vegetables for fajitas including zucchini, mushrooms, roasted corn, and asparagus in addition to the usual peppers and onions. The mushrooms needed additional cooking but the flavors were delicious. Our group also had tableside guac which was enough for the four of us. I do think the portions are large and the prices somewhat high but overall we were pleased with the quality and service."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food. Ordered a combo to be able to try a couple different things. Chicken enchilada was really good. Not too heavy cream sauce and the chicken was moist and flavorful. The carne was delicious too.  Could pass on the cheese enchilada and tamale. The chilie con carne tasted a bit like hormel.  Only real criticism I would have is the food cam out warm, not hot. Thought about sending it back but didn't want it nuked."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic! Had the tableside Guacamole and Enchiladas. My wife had the Chicken tacos and the kids shared a chicken fingers meal. And we finished everything with the Mexican Brownie. Great food! Every bit was bursting with flavor! You can definitely tell that they make everything fresh. For those that say it is bland, they definitely have no palate! Again, Fantastic Service! Ask for Ella, She was awesome! The menu is priced appropriately as well. Located at San Tan Village and rightfully so! I will be heading back again this week!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience!  From the 1st call to inquire about a Saturday reservation for 18 for our (4) birthday celebrations through the dinner.   Lily is an absolute doll, Jose our server was awesome, and the rest of the staff was equally as great!  The private dining area was reserved for us and originally set up as two separate tables, however, upon our request Lily and her team quickly reset the tables in a U shape and with the most pleasant demeanor!  The food including the carne asada with stuffed poblano, the fajitas, table side guacamole, chile con queso, ensalada with mango and chicken, enchiladas, and tacos were all very tasty.  The margaritas are great as well.  In addition, our Birthday boys and girls were each presented with birthday brownies.  Without hesitation, they separated our checks into 4 different parties, promptly cleared our plates, and allowed us to visit without feeling rushed (some of us came from California and others from Nebraska).  I can't say enough about the great service, food and ambience.   Thank you Lily, Jose and all of the staff of Cantina Laredo.  We really enjoyed the experience and will definitely visit when we come back to Las Vegas again."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've dined at this place during happy hour time! Which by the way, the HH is a freaking deal! So much food.. so little $$!  To start off, for some odd reason, I love the decor of this place! Especially the big door when you enter!  Now the food.. I ordered the Ahi Tuna Tacos, chicken taco, barbacoa taco and pesacado taco, and the SLIDERS!!  Chips and salsa is complimentary. Thin corn chips with 2 different kinds of salsa. Both were delicious!   The tacos were good.. nothing to rage and tell friends about. All served on corn tortilla unless requested otherwise. The chicken was too salty so that kind of overshadowed any salsa or toppings on it. Fish taco was good.. I'm always a fan of fish tacos. Barbacoa was great.. the red onions on top is what makes it!   But now THE SLIDERS!!! who would ever think sliders at a Mexican restaurant would be any good.. but I tell ya! Order these then thank me later... I guarantee you will. These are charcoal grilled sliders with aioli, guacamole and BACON! These burgers are good! Not dried or overcooked. Seasoned perfectly! It is served with fries that are beyond words. The fries are topped with caramelized jalapeños and onions! This is the best HH item on their menu!   The bartender, I forgot his name already. He was very nice and great service. It was slow so he really chit chatted with us."}
{"text":"My grandmother always said that if you don't have something good to say, don't say anything at all.  Sorry Grandma...  We've enjoyed drinks there a couple of times before, but I guess there's a difference between being at the bar and watching them make your drink, versus ordering drinks at the table where you get, well, what they give you.  Those simple margaritas sure didn't taste like they were made with the Herradura reposado we paid extra for.  The beef enchiladas were made with ground beef (I should have asked) and had a mushy texture (I'm guessing beans).  The beef tacos should have been called onion beef tacos, if they have to list ingredients by quantity.  Service was sub-par.  Tables hadn't been cleared, yet I watched a busboy walk around with empty hands.  The best part of the meal were the chips that came first -- they were light and crisp, and not salted.  Too bad most chips were broken up so small that we couldn't eat them with the dip.  All in all, a mistake we won't make again."}
{"text":"Food: We ordered the table side guacamole. I love guacamole, so if they are going to make it to my specifications then even better! The one down side to this is that they do not have salt or lime on the tray to add in. Definitely need to add salt and/or lime. I had the steak and chicken fajitas. I didn't even make it to the chicken because the steak was so good. My friend ordered the chorizo tacos and really enjoyed them.   Drinks: long list of margaritas and other cocktails, as well as wine and beer. I had the skinny margaritas. I was very happy with it.   Vibe: a fancy Mexican place. If you didn't look at the name or menu, you wouldn't even know it was a Mexican restaurant - no tacky decor or bright colors. Great place to grab a few drinks with friends.  Gluten free options available  At Tivoli, so parking is super easy - garage, valet, outside lot"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a spot to have happy hour on my days off and I just found it!!.. Food is amazing and the drinks were just on point!!!!! Eduardo our bartender was just amazing, drinks were just made right and his service was just impeccable!! I felt super spoiled like no other!.. Definitely coming back just to see him!!"}
{"text":"Had the tacos Barbacoa and I have to say it was void of any flavor. Too many onions!!  The cinco margarita was strong but did not enjoy it. Glad I got it for $5 instead of $11. Our server was Lisa and she was upbeat and very personable. She was the best part of the experience."}
{"text":"Not impressed! My chicken fajita was mediocre. I was expecting my chicken fajita to arrive sizzling but it arrived cold and overcooked. The food must of been sitting on the counter too long waiting to be picked up. The runner was careless and still delivered my food knowing that it was cold. Our waiter finally arrived and placed a new order. I don't plan on returning for an overpriced chicken fajita and poor service."}
{"text":"Even though Tivoli Village is a Ghost Town waiting to happen.  I applaud the amount of restaurants they have there.  I've seen a few turnover (Petra / Double Helix) however stopping in at Cantina Laredo for their happy hour made my trip worth it.  Their Happy Hour is from 4pm - 7pm & 9pm - close.  We hit the later up.  Our party of three went through 2 rounds of their Casita 'Rita ($3) and a bunch of their flavorful tacos.  Would go back for the value during happy hour."}
{"text":"I've been here three times, so I obviously like it, though not without complaint.  I think the food is really good, and the drinks are great but very pricey for off the Strip.  The restaurant is beautiful, and I'm looking forward to warm weather when the patio with bar seating is open.  There's something for everyone on the menu, and everyone enjoyed their food every time I've been.  Service has been an issue, and you get the sense that the young ladies out front are more about eye candy than knowing how to seat guests.  You can find both in this town, CL, so keep looking.  My biggest complaint with CL, like many places off the Strip, is that guests should be greeted by a server within five minutes of being seated.  If you're not able to do that, you're not really ready to seat them.  I hope CL works out it's server issues because I want them to hang around.  If they don't, they won't, and that would be a shame--it's a cool place."}
{"text":"We sat in the bar during Happy Hour so we were able to take advantage of their $5 margarita special and 1/2 price bar menu.    They immediately bring to the table a large bowl of fresh tortillas chips with some decent salsas. We ordered the margarita special and some pollo and pescado tacos.    The server was overworked thus not too attentive. The margaritas were not too bad. The fish tacos were fabulous but the chicken tacos were dreadful. Only dumping a generous amount of salsa on the chicken taco could provide enough moisture and flavor to the chicken to make them palatable.   Overall, if you are hitting Cantina Laredo before 7 PM you won't do too badly if you sit in the bar and order off the bar menu."}
{"text":"The food here is extremely fresh and made with high quality ingredients. I ordered the tacos de pollo and a pomegranate margarita. Both of which I would highly recommend. Even the next day the tacos were amazing. The evening atmosphere is very calm and dark. My only complaint was that we were seated by a family who was very loud and it was hard to hear others at my table talking."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday and me and my wife and it was amazing staff was great nice friendly food was delicious the guacamole was made fresh right in front of your face I would recommend this place to anybody"}
{"text":"Chicken enchiladas were terrible - could tell they were cooked and left to reheat under a heat lamp. It was boiled chicken with no flavor wrapped in soggy tortillas with a pretty standard cheese sauce. The rice tasted like it was microwaved. The waiter kept leaning over me instead of walking to the other side of the table. He didn't replace the silverware from dinner when we ordered dessert. Disappointing food and service."}
{"text":"For a brunch munch, Cantina Laredo delivers a tasty Mexican food punch!   While in search of a place, the free Mimosas or Blood Marie attracted my friends' and my attention. As dubious as a lure sounds, the food was delicious! We ordered chorizo con huevos, carne asda y huevos, and huevos rancheros. Just like the menu suggested, we really thought we were just getting eggs and a bit of meat. To our surprise, the plentiful platter came with delicious sweet white bread, potatoes with melted cheese, and syrup-soaked sun-ripen fruit. Needless to say we were stuffed.  The sweet bread is a crowd-pleaser. If only I had my hands on that recipe. And another kicker? This place is a chain. We thought, \"No way!\" Too bad it is not in California, yet. The tasty food really knocked my taste buds out of my tongue!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a step up in Mexican cuisine Cantna Laredo is a great choice. They offer traditional fare as well as wonderfully prepared carnitas and table-side guacamole."}
{"text":"This is really a 3.5 star rating but I bumped it to 4 stars because the salsa they give you when you first sit down (complimentary) was really good!!! There's two kinds: One is more spicier than the other and has a kick of spice to it. The other...pretty mild and it taste like a bean dip (taste better than it sounds...trust me lol)  Now onto the food: I really like the portions...its smaller than most \"authentic mexican\" restaurant dishes. Some of you might not like this but I do cuz I'm weight conscious. lol I get paranoid if I feel like I'm eating a bunch of food. But lets not get sidetrack. =) My boyfriend ordered a chicken enchilada and I also order a chicken enchilada with a sweet sauce on top of it. My boyfriend and I both thought it was eh...just okay. The rice didn't taste so good. To me, it was kind of bland. I had to drench that in salsa. Prices I think came out to be around $12-16 per dish. Obviously more expensive if you were going order any type of seafood entree.  Would I come back here? Probably not. I'm not a drinker so I didn't try any drinks but maybe this place would've been better for those who like to drink and such. This would be a good little spot to grab a drink, eat some ceviches, or have some complimentary salsa and chips."}
{"text":"Love this restuarant!  Not many places in Vegas for good mexican food, but this place is awesome!  Very comforting and inviting atmosphere.  Great happy hour specials, and my fav half off wine Wednesday!  Great service and very yummy food!  Ahi tuna tacos are delish!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour on a Saturday. Ordered the queso fundido, shrimp and pineapple flatbread, and the chicken tacos. The food was outstanding, and the service was very good and the restaurant is a nice modern place. My experience was one of a kind. I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed in this place.  Our group tried a lot of stuff, and it was all \"Meh\".  Flavorless, nothing.  And this is supposed to be Mexican food!    Also, quite overpriced too in the San Tan area."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Beautiful place inside and out but the food not so much. Our two dishes were the Chilean sea bass with cilantro lime rice and asparagus and the beef enchiladas. The bass dish was tasty but I'm not so sure the fish was cooked through. The enchiladas were terrible. The meat had no flavor and the sauce taste like it came from a can.  The flan for dessert however was awesome. We also had the ahi tuna tacos and they were delicious. So I guess it's hit or miss. Not worth the high prices to gamble. I won't be back. The sign outside says \"Modern Mexican Food\" what does that mean anyway?"}
{"text":"This place rocks love the guacamole it's the best in town the food comes out super quick. The ambiance is very nice and still causal. Great Sunday brunch special s with bloody Mary's or mirmosas. I have tried all there tacos and they are all good. The cilantro chicken salad is very good as well. Staff is super friendly great Mexican spot"}
{"text":"I love this place. We ate at Carlos OBriens down the street first and I thought yuck, where is the mexican food in scottsdale. Well, I found it! The food was delicious. The service was a little slow, but I was blown away by the food so I will tolerate the service."}
{"text":"There is something special about walking into a place where everyone knows your name. Cliche, sure, and does it bias my opinion of a place? Absolutely. Either way, Cantina Laredo is still a great restaurant.   What really draws my attention to Cantina Laredo (other than the worlds greatest employees) is the happy hour. Most importantly their happy hour runs until 7pm. For the self proclaimed workaholic that I am, this is very important. Ever get off work at 6:30pm only to drive home wishing there was a place still serving $3 margaritas? Happens all the time... now there is a fix.   The food is delicious, most everything on the menu is exceptional; though a few things really stand out.   1. Table side Guac- yes I know, it's been done before, but who cares! They make it next to your table and it's delicious.   2. Pulled pork anything (ie. sliders or shanks). This stuff is marinated perfectly and I can attest to the fact that you will not find anything this fantastic between here an the south pole.   3. This flaming apple pie thing they have for dessert will give you a contact drunk from both the sugar and the alcohol that is contained within.   4. They have Negra Modelo on tap, usually served in an icy (like actually icy) tall glass.  Good food, good people, good choice."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised while out at San Tan to find this place for a icy margarita and early dinner whilst the sun goes down.. Nice patio.. Perfect Patron Margs.. and a really cool prix fixe menu.. Which isnt the usual sample sizes you end up with at times with those chosen courses. AND its only about $16 for a 3 course dinner... My one thing I couldnt tolerate was the taquitos... greasy beyond belief down to the dry chicken centered within the greasy 'shell'.. Attentive waitstaff.. good food.. Bueno for the Cantina.."}
{"text":"I was skepticle about this place at first, but once I took the first bite, I was overwhelmed with the quality and the taste of the food. We ordered Pollo Chipotle and Asada Y Enchiladas. Both of them super delicious, service was excellent. Will definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My husband and i love this place.... The food is AMAZING and the drink choices are FANTASTIC!!!"}
{"text":"We went for Father's Day dinner with a Groupon (of course)! Atmosphere was nice, drinks were good (and strong), service was friendly and the food was good. Don't know that we would return as their menu is pretty small but we were glad to try it once."}
{"text":"The food wasn't really authentic mexican. I didn't try the table side guacamole because it was extra, but I''m guessing it was probably better then the one that is cheaper. Worst guacamole ever, was it even real? Ceviche tasted like it was marinated with tabasco. Mahi Mahi tacos were okay, I've had better. The shrimp enchilada's hardly had any shrimp or anything inside of them but they were drenched in sour cream, yum. I mean if you are into that kind of fake mexican food you should be okay, but in all honesty you should really just go to cafe rio instead. However, the waitress was very sweet."}
{"text":"The best espresso in town!  Great service and amazing atmosphere. The mediterranean breakfast is just like a real Mediterranean breakfast should be, look and taste like.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"We went here about a week ago. It was a nice atmosphere with decent decor, friendly service and seemingly fair prices given the location inside the upscale Tivoli Village. Both the inside and outside seating areas looked nice, well-lit with good ambiance. We opted to sit outside... which was a mistake. It reeked of smoke coming from the cigar shop next door. No matter, two drinks (each) later and we didn't care so much. The guacamole was very good and that's about it. We ordered chorizo tacos, chicken enchiladas, and vegetarian enchiladas. All three dishes were extremely greasy. Like, grease with a side of food greasy. The enchiladas looked like something from a gas station. The chicken dish tasted fine but the vegetarian dish was not good at all. I did not try the tacos because I personally do not like chorizo, although the person who ordered them did enjoy them. The vegetarian in our group did not finish their food but both of us carnivores did. This, again, was a mistake. I'll spare you the details but thanks to all that grease and possibly in part to the cigar smoke, we both were very sick the entire next day. At first I thought I had a fever but it was very clearly food-related. Yuck."}
{"text":"Excellent service! From the host Jon, to our server Duke. They both accommodate our needs and noticed how they both paid attention to everyone's needs. FANTASTIC service from those 2 gentlemen."}
{"text":"Good food. Beautiful patio. Amazing Mexican brownie with cinnamon ice cream. To die for."}
{"text":"This is my 4th time coming here, foods great service is TERRIBLE!!! Sat on the patio and within 10 mins we received our dog which was delicious! Love love love spicy food and boy were my taste buds happy! Unfortunately after we ate flies started to sworn our table to get the left over uneaten food, server never checked on us, eventually because we were so full we just switched tables our original table never was cleared and after we got the bill at our new table server never questioned why we moved or apologize for not clearing the table...so will I come back? I'm not sure, terrible service can most defiantly kill a potentially great restaurant"}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad meal or cocktail here.  Wait staff is better than average.   However, last night, it took 20 minutes to get our cocktails and 30 minutes for dessert to arrive.  Granted, it was a busy Saturday night, but the bar and kitchen should have been staffed up. We did make a complaint to the manager and his response was appropriate."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 4 stars but really somewhere around 3.5 - 3.75, thus the upgrade.   Went here during a business trip. $5 happy hour margaritas weren't bad. Coworker had the cascabel ribeye and I had the Camaraones Esconidos (shrimp stuffed chicken breast w/ chipotle wine sauce). I thought my meal was pretty good...loved the sauce but very disappointed there were only two shrimp for the \"stuffed\" portion.  My coworker said his ribeye was far from his expectations. The menu overall looked good. I'd go back again and have that same chicken dish or try something new."}
{"text":"This is one of the nicer and better mexican restaurants in the valley. It is hard to find parking, but that is because it is at the mall.  The receptionists are not nice -- at all, ever, but the wait staff is really cool, helpful, and non-pushy.   It is cold in the front part of the restaurant by the door, but you can ask to be seated in the back by the fire and will enjoy the much more private and warm atmosphere. The food is really good.  You can save some money by signing up for their emails and get a free appetizer. The guacamole is the best!"}
{"text":"We definitely weren't impressed with the food. The meat in the enchiladas was super dry and not really flavorful. Chips and salsa were just OK. Margaritas were good."}
{"text":"We hosted a happy hour event in the back room, and was fabulous. About 50 people came and they opened a small cash bar up just for our group. Dave the manager was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed from the time I booked the event until the time we left. Great service and everything about CL exceeded our expectations. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food, good service, comfortable surroundings. Excellent choice."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite mexican restaurant in this area. The service is fantastic, the food is amazing, and the atmosphere is relaxing and upscale.  I have been here several times and never had to wait for a table -- the restaurant is huge.   I typically order the tableside guacamole which is hands down THE BEST guacamole  . It is expensive but they make a lot of it and it's absolutely delicious. Last night I ordered the queso with ground beef -- sooo yummy. My boyfriend and I ordered another round of chips just to finish it -- and we didn't even get close. It was so filling that by the time my entree came I was pretty full.  I always get the same thing here -- beef fajitas with no beans, extra rice, and a side of shredded jack cheese. The beef here tastes like pretty good quality and is flavored perfectly. They give you a lot of food. I usually have one fajita and take the rest home.  When I'm in the mood to drink I love their mojitos -- they are all amazingly good. A bit pricey but you get a huge, tall drink.   The only downside to Cantina Laredo is their dessert selection. I'm not a fan of any desserts they offer. However, my boyfriend loves the flan. He is from Argentina and says it's very well-done."}
{"text":"Way over priced. Very basic margarita $8, a good margarita $12.50, and the food cost is worse. Three chicken taco's, with just meat in the tortilla, rice, beans, and queso on the side $17.50!!!  They could at least add some peppers, onions, or gold flakes for that price. The food is average Mexican food, and not worth the price.  Server was very friendly, which earned them 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"BEWARE!!! My husband and i both had a few bites of the steak from there and it didnt taste right so we stopped eating it. (That is the only thing we both ate the same that day). We both ended up with horrifying food poisoning for 2 days. I am pregnant so of course i am extremely scared and mad. Still have yet to get the little one checked out... but hopefully the baby is okay. PLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE! I feel like i died for 2 days and am finally coming back to life."}
{"text":"Would have done better at a chipotle  Came here for a Mother's Day dinner. The place was a total mess, like a chunky cheese. All kinds of food waste on the carpet under the tables. Our waiter even had food smeared all over his shirt.   Service was a struggle, we had to ask for everything multiple times, and they didn't clear the table if old items as the new items came out. Food was decent but overall not worth the price."}
{"text":"Things have definitely improved! Service has been very attentive the last couple of times we have been here. Always love the chips, and the salsa's. The entrees have greatly improved, and you can't go wrong with most of the chicken dishes. They just need to maintain a level of consistency!"}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo was not very good. I did feel that it was a little pricey as well. I went here with my boss to check out their banquet room and try some of their food for an upcoming vendor conference our company is having. The atmosphere is very nice and modern. The service was great. We ordered the botanas platter to share which came with tacos al pastor, chicken fajita quesadillas, chili con queso, Guacamole, stuffed jalapenos, and beef, shrimp and vegetable skewers. Nothing really wowed me though. The best thing on the platter was probably the stuffed jalapenos but you only got two and they were pretty small. The tacos were kinda dry and bland as were the quesadillas, and the skewers had only one shrimp and one tough piece of beef on them. I thought it was kinda a rip off. The queso was ok but tasted like your typical Velveeta cheese dip. In addition, we ordered a cup each of the sopa de tortilla. Trying to be fancy, the waiter arrived with two bowls of tortilla strips, chicken, and onions. Then he poured the thick soups table-side. Yippy. I really wasn't impressed. Table-side anything is just stupid and useless in my opinion. The soup really was not very good. Was a bit too pungent in flavor and smell. Almost tasted like a bowl of enchilada sauce. Needless to say, my boss and I didn't eat very much of it. Even the complimentary chips and salsa were not that great. The warm roasted poblano salsa was terrible I thought and the other salsa was mediocre. I had very high hopes for this restaurant and was disappointed immensely. On a positive note, they do have a great banquet room that can hold up to 50 people and it has LCD TVs and surround sound so its great for presentations and corporate events. Would I try it again? I am all about giving places second chances so I would go again and try ordering an actual meal. If it sucks again, I will conclude that this place is overpriced, crappy, and not worth anymore of my time."}
{"text":"Love the table side guacamole.  Great service!  This is a great restaurant and one that I love to take out of town guests to show off our beautiful city!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so this place is yummy. The margaritas are legit; the guacamole portion was skimpy, but all in all, the food and service is great!"}
{"text":"Just not a big fan of this place. I seem to wind up here at least once a year, out of convenience, when I'm at San Tan Mall with friends or family.   Plain and simple, the place is over priced, and the food is mediocre. It's not bad, per say, but it's just not good either, especially for the price.   With new and good Mexican places popping up near the mall, Cantina Laredo needs to step up its game.   If I'm in the area, I prefer Isabel's Amor for drinks, or Pescado Borracho. For tacos, I'd rather go to Back Yard, Guedos, or make the drive to Los Taquitos.   I'll update this review in a year, when I inevitably end up here again."}
{"text":"Carlos was working fast & hard during lunch. He was so busy & still took time to give us great service. We will definitely come back to see him!! Food is good too!!       Rod & Bri"}
{"text":"Ate there last night. Two of the four dinners made where wrong even as they brought back what should have been corrected it was wrong. The whole dinner was a disaster  on top of that the correct thing would have been to offer a desert or something. We are not the types that look to get comps or bitch about service but it was bad.  Two of ate while the others had to sit there. Once they received their dinner we had to do the same.   Well all I can say that's another one off the list. I will stick to El Segundo on the strip"}
{"text":"Please save your money. I spent $80 and wish I could get every sent back. I created an account to comment on this place. The food was edible, but had no flavor at all! The guacamole tasted like it came from a bag. My sour cream was melted by the time I got it. The chicken was cooked to cardboard. To say I will never go there again is an understatement. The waiter was fantastic, food was a waste of time and money. Oh and the drinks tasted like you were licking salt, I got a salt rim, but maybe some feel into my drink as they made it.....never agin. Save your money."}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo is okay by me. The food is good. The drinks are good. The atmosphere and decor is alright. But that's just the problem. Everything is just \"okay\".  The only thing that stood out for me is the chips & guacamole. The make it right at your table, and you are able to omit any ingredients you choose. This is a big deal for me because I HATE onions. So I can get delicious guacamole without having to scoop around the onions.  I eat here occasionally, but I never really crave it."}
{"text":"First visit - happy hour - we had several items on the happy hour menu and were quite 'happy' ... however... visit number two left me not so happy...  Brunch on a Sunday morning.  Seated promptly.  Chips and salsa - really good!  Loved both types of salsa offered.  I ordered the crab cake Benedict ... mehhh ... I've had a LOT better.  Egg poached perfectly.  The chipotle-wine hollandaise was ok, nothing special.  The crab cake, however, was mushy, thin, and I could barely taste any crab.  A spoonful or two of potatoes (but they tasted ok) ... and the best part of the meal - a cinnamon fried tortilla with fruit.  The complementary Bloody Maria was good.    My dining companion doesn't care for eggs, so he ordered the only thing on the brunch menu that didn't involve eggs. Chilaquiles (Chicken, sautéed tortillas in salsa tomatillo sauce) - came out while he was away from the table.  I was floored - and took a picture in case there was a discussion with management.  A FEW chunks of chicken, tortilla chips and a bit of tomatillo sauce (and the same small portion of potatoes and fruit/tortilla) .. I couldn't believe that what appeared to be a small portion of green nachos with a chunk or two of chicken was considered an entrée.  At these prices ... not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Maybe not the world's most authentic Mexican food, but oh how I love Cantina Laredo.  I go here every time I visit friends in Phoenix, and I've never had a bad meal here.  At dinner I'm partial to the camaron poblano asada.  The combination of steak, poblano pepper, and shrimp is fantastic, and I've never had meat cooked this perfectly before.  On my last visit for lunch I had the mole enchiladas, and they were excellent-- maybe not the best mole I've ever had, but heaven for this Mexican-food-starved-Seattleite.  They make the guacamole tableside and can make it as spicy as you want, which is nice.  Their chips are good as are both salsas, although I didn't really detect a difference in heat.  The beer selection is good, and I remember liking their margaritas as well.  Service is great (tableside guacamole!) and  the building itself is pretty.  Definitely a fan."}
{"text":"This place is in the Tivoli Village, looks pretty fancy, like it's in its own world. Came for dinner on date night with my husband, sat at the bar since it was a 15 minute wait for the booths, luckily they still had happy hour (ends at 7pm), that's pretty late, most places happy hour ends at 6pm. I ended ordering the HH Ahi Poke Tacos (u get 3) and the Carnitas Sliders with fries (u get 2). The sliders said it had goat cheese and peach jam, but it was hardly in there, it made it taste dry since it wasn't all over and the Ahi tacos we're really good, definitely would order again. My husband had the mole enchiladas and he liked it and he's picky with his food. They make fresh guacamole at your table so you decide how you want it. They have daily specials Sunday - Thursday, we came on a Thursday and it was ladies night, $4 Casarita (signature margarita). To top it off, we had the Mango Tres Leches and it was so good. Gotta go back and try more of their food"}
{"text":"dined outside (covered)  enjoyed Thursday $4 happy hour frozen mango 'ritas! with chips & salsa  a couple dishes a la plancha--everything delicious"}
{"text":"This has become a favorite of my husband and I. We love the salsa and everything we've had there has been delicious! It's also kind of fancy :)"}
{"text":"I'm usually not a fan of chain restaurants, but if you're going to go with one, this might as well be it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is nice, but I definitely won't be back. I had the tres fajita plate, which consists of steak, chicken, and bacon wrapped shrimp. The chicken was bland, and the shrimp was bone dry and flavorless. The steak was tender and delicious, so I don't know how they managed to mess up the chicken and shrimp. The rest of the meal, which consisted of beans, rice and flour tortillas, was not bad, but certainly not good. I would have given the place at least three stars were it not for the higher than average price of the food, but the food here is nowhere near worth the money you'll spend. I had a Margarita that tasted like 98% tequila and maybe a squirt of Margarita mix, I had to add about 10 limes to it to make it taste like something at least close to a real Margarita. To top it all off, the service was slow, and our server never came to check on us until I glared in her direction... never mind the fact the place was nowhere near busy. Cantina Laredo was not a good experience for me, so that's a wrap for me. The pictures I snapped of the food came out amazing, but don't be fooled, it was all just bland. Proceed caution..."}
{"text":"I have only been twice, but I am a fan! The happy hour is great. Fun atmosphere and affordable prices.  If you go, do try the chicken quesadillas.  The chicken is plump, white chunks with delicious melted cheese.  Yum.  Wish I had one right now.  Chips and salsa are pretty darn good too- margaritas are great too if you are in the mood."}
{"text":"Classy place, very nice, drinks are cold as ice, literally, and the tequila is perfect, so many choices too.  Happy hour is a great little fun drinky time.   Plus the food gets a solid rating. Service is a 10!   Always great to discover a new hideout noone knows about that is calm, chill, and just what the doctor and the attorney ordered for me.   Tequila, beer, and tacos, that always solves the weeklong blues."}
{"text":"Fresh, excellently prepared quality food, but bland. A friend of mine described it this way: Not the best Mexican food, but the best Mexican food. The quality, and presentation are great. The prices are okay too. They have the best Bloody Mary in town, though."}
{"text":"My favorite up-scale Mexican restaurant! Their salsa is delicious, their Barbacoa tacos are incredible, their pork torta is delectable and their apple pie is like nothing you've ever eaten before- I promise! Trust me on this one- get the skillet apple pie. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Wow. The dessert was unbelievable. I will try to do a complete review and not only focus on the dessert, but seriously, that's all I can think about.   We went here for dinner last night. Although the service was friendly, it was quite slow. Slow to get our drinks, and slow to get the table-side guac. Once we did get them however, everything was awesome. Hubby ordered the strawberry mojito which he literally downed in about 3.5 seconds flat. He loved it. I had a dirty martini, and although the waiter forgot the olives, the martini itself was pretty darn good.   The table side guac was tasty and plentiful - easily enough for a group of 4. With just the 2 of us, we left a lot of it uneaten.   I ordered a \"new\" menu item, the portabella and goat cheese enchiladas, and the husband ordered the carne asada and camarones. We both LOVED our dishes. Although I was disappointed in the fact that I got a mango salad on the side instead of the rice which is what the waiter said I would be getting. Shame on me for not reading the menu more carefully (I hate mango).   Even though we were both delightfully stuffed, we ordered dessert. OMG. No really, OMG. The best dessert I've had in a LONG time. I keep thinking about it. I wish I could have another one today. We had the \"Mexican Brownie\". In case I didn't already mention it - OMG! SO absolutely delicious. It's a huge brownie filled with LOTS of nuts (I think walnuts, don't remember exactly), served on a hot skillet with vanilla ice cream and a brandy sauce. No really, I think I have to go over there today and get another one. It's so unbelievably tasty.   So, bottom line, when you go, whatever you do, you MUST leave room for this delicious chocolatey sizzling mouthwatering goodness.   p.s. I would give the place 5 stars if it wasn't for the slow service. Oh, also, it's a bit on the pricey side (specialty dishes, like the carne asada and shrimp the hubby had, are over $20)."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place.  Not even accounting for their KILLER HAPPY HOUR, the menu is amazing.  No compromises from authentic Mexican, the menu is familiar items with unique twists and high quality ingredients that make it hard to ever go back to \"just another Mexican restaurant\".  Try the fajitas and the slow cooked carnitas."}
{"text":"This was our go to date night spot! I would always get the carne asada, and my husband would always try something new! The made at your table guacamole is delicious! And the bar always had something yummy to drink! The staff was always so friendly. Even going for lunch with the kids was great! If there was one close by in Texas, we would definitely go all the time!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. You have to be prepared to spend some time there though.  Our dinner took 1.5 hrs. A little long for us   Also pretty expensive .  But we enjoyed our meals very much"}
{"text":"I was excited about eating here after having a great experience at the San Tan location a couple of months ago.  This time I was left under whelmed.  While our waiter was very enthusiastic, it didn't translate into the food.  The tableside guacmole was pretty bland as was my crab enchiladas.  The Fajitas one of my lunch partners ordered was very good, at least the steak was, avoid the chicken.  Maybe I wasn't hungry enough or they are having an off day, either day, it wasn't quite as good."}
{"text":"Some friends that live close by suggested it.  I was very impressed, my friends are vegan, so finding a place that accomodates them can be challenging, but this place did it without pause, and the waitress understood me when I said I was pescatarian, she had great recommendations and the dish was the special Sea Bass.  Very good!  I really enjoyed the thin and low salt chips they provide as well."}
{"text":"A great experience. My wife ordered fish tacos and I had the enchiladas. They started off with a generous bowl of chips and  hot (temp) and cold dishes  of salsa. Loved the salsas, especially the warm one. Our dishes were well presented and generous, and were both delicious.  The wait-staff was exceptional and when our leftover boxes were prepared our waiter made sure there were some chips and warm salsa bagged to go.  Cantina Laredo is now our favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the guacamole, a bit pricey"}
{"text":"The server was nice but covering too many areas so the service and drink refills were horribly slow.  The food is no where near authentic, it is extremely bland. I will probably never find a reason to return. The two stars is for the courteous staff."}
{"text":"What? I've never left a review for my favorite spot?? Oh where do I start? Ok, the Bandera margarita. It's the best marg I've ever had. Three layers like the Mexican flag... madori on the bottom, pomegranate in the middle and regular on top. Now, I'm not usually one for frozen or sweet marks but this is it. Even the house margs are fab.  Food.. chips and salsa rock. Lots of shrimp entrees to love. Fajitas are bomb. Tacos de pescado rick, the shrimp stuffed pompano is one of my faves. Hubby usually gets the ribeye, used to be on the menu, but now a special, marinated in cascabel sauce? It's great. Love sitting on the patio people watching. Good food good margs good times."}
{"text":"Where to even begin.... I guess with the chips?  Their chips and salsa are always good, definitely try the hotter salsa! So yummy.   The chicken is probably the number one reason why I keep coming back here. Whether it's in the chimichanga or in the escondidos, you will not be disappointed in any dish with the chicken.   *Try the lunch chimichanga topped with queso instead of ranchera."}
{"text":"I tried to order a whole Tres Leches cake from this restaurant for my husbands birthday because he loves the cake.  Their rate to me for the cake was $160.  Instead of making a decent profit on selling the whole cake at a reasonable markup,  they make nothing and they lose a weekly customer and any and all future recommendations.  It was absolutely a ridiculous price to charge and the girl on the phone could care less."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night right around 6:30pm as happy hour was ending, it wasn't too busy.  Service: Server was busy too know what was going on. We asked if we can get a spicier salsa...He forgot about our request and when the salsa came out, all we tasted was Tabasco sauce. We also had to remind him about getting our 2nd round of drinks.  Food: I'll be real, I am no mexican food snob but this was the run of the mill Mexican restaurant. Nothing special or over the top good. We ordered the Ceviche = way too salty, the Enchiladas Veracruz = really bland, Taco Pollo = still bland, The Fajitas with the steak+chicken+ribs = really avg.  Atmosphere: it's decent for wanting to be a \"gourmet\" restaurant. The place is clean and the staff for the most part was nice.  I've been here a few times, but there is no particular reason for me to come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! I ordered the artichoke and mushroom omelette which was huge and delicious (I recommend adding chicken). I wasn't a fan of the cheesy potatoes though and heads up.... a TON of green peppers in the omelette. The omelette came with a complimentary mimosa because of brunch, so that was cool! Chips/salsa were tasty. We also had the chicken tacos which were good as well. Our servers name was Juan and he gave us absolutely exceptional service!!! I was certainly impressed with his demeanor and how he catered to us, so I thank him for that! Definitely coming back for more soon!"}
{"text":"Had a great time out on the patio during the happy hour.  Priced very reasonably and the food was good.  Had beef enchiladas and they hit the spot.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Always a favorite spot, last night the Cantina Laredo Fajita's for four were charged as if for 8 server couldn't fix the bill! Then the meat was reheated cold meat since it was late. It was a critically ill friends birthday - and I didnt not want to make a big deal? Boycott!"}
{"text":"Went to check out this new restaurant at Crocker park located by bonefish the wait was only 20 minutes good atmosphere waitress Lauren was good and knowledgeable we ordered our drinks and they were good food was also good I had the steak fajita burrito it was delicious and a little spicy dessert was apple pie topped with cinnamon ice cream very delicious"}
{"text":"I was here for a babyshower today, and this is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant! AMAZING food, amazing service, and an amazing atmosphere! I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for my holiday work party. Our group had about 30 people show up and we had two servers which was enough for us. Waiting a few extra minutes for our drinks and chips and salsa refills was expected, but you could tell the employees were working hard to make our night enjoyable. We were given a set menu that unfortunately was not printed out for some reason so the poor waitress had to repeat the items over and over. The margaritas were tasty and did the job of easing me into a relaxed night with my coworkers. My meal of veggie tacos with sides of rice and beans was flavorful came out about 15 minutes after ordering and again, that was fine with me. Gave me time to chat and catch up. There was outside seating that I bet is enjoyable during nice weather. When my work votes for where to have the holiday party next year, I am going to recommend Cantina Laredo."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas where we have some of the BEST Tex-Mex restaurants in the USA.   SO, I was skeptical about this place, especially since I have not found a really good Mexican restuarant here in LV.  Well, Cantina Laredo solved that problem because it certainly adds up to the best that Texas has.  The tableside guacamole was absolutely perfect - enchiladas were delicious!!    Their HH has some great prices, and the margs are very good ---- and potent, too!  LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I've ever attempted to eat. I next to never write reviews, but this was so awful I just had to. It's currently sitting in the garbage, barely touched. This review doesn't even deserve one star. Unfortunately, I ordered this through a delivery service so there isn't much else I can do at this point. First, I ordered cheese enchiladas and found them slathered in a red meat sauce. More meat than sauce actual. I have NEVER ordered enchiladas anywhere where this was the standard prep method. I cannot eat meat, it makes me extremely ill and for medical reasons is not part of my diet. Hence, why I ordered cheese and not beef or chicken. Again, who prepares cheese enchiladas like this?! I checked both the menu of the service I used and the restaurant directly to see if I made the mistake on my end regarding their means of preparation. I see no mention of this meat sauce being their standard red sauce for enchiladas. If this is their take and way of serving the meal, cool no problem, but it should be noted. Second, the beans and rice were horribly bland and dry. Third, I ordered the queso blanco which was described as a cheese dip with poblano peppers, spinach and artichoke. Umm, where the heck where these ingredients? I dug threw the cup of dip with a fork just to make sure. I found one piece of spinach the size of a penny. Additionally, the chips were soaked in grease and too salty to even attempt to eat. I took a few bites at best and trashed it. This was my first time trying this restaurant and definitely my last. PB&J for dinner it is!  What a waste of $30 bucks!!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite happy hour place. Good margaritas and food, I've come a few times and each time I'm reminded of what makes this place a gem. Yesterday we had a large group which they perfectly accommodated us on the patio near the back so it was a private section. Our server Jaclyn was amazing and quick. Thanks for being a great place to entertain at."}
{"text":"Our waitress came and asked us how everything was at the end of the meal verses while we eating. Margaritas were not good. Salsa was very good."}
{"text":"We visited Cantina Laredo quite a few times while we lived in Phoenix and we were never disappointed.   If you are coming during peak dinner hours on a Friday or Saturday, expect a wait. We usually try to plan to come early or late to avoid the rush. The bar area is really nice for people wanting to come in for happy hour and enjoy some drinks with friends. The ambiance of the rest of the restaurant is nice, romantic, and low lit. Great place to come for a date.   Service has always been great and the last time we visited my server was very familiar with gluten free allergy needs and went out of his way to check on things for me. Wait time for food is normal and you can keep yourself busy with their nom nom chips and salsas (one of their salsas is gluten free, so ask if you have an allergy)  I was pleased to find a good amount of the menu can be made, or is naturally, gluten free. While I couldn't have what I used to get (which is awesome and everyone should try it if you aren't allergic to wheat!) the spinach enchilada with cream sauce, the avocado enchilada I had was very good. The table side guac was awesome and the mixed drinks are always amazing. We've also tried their fajitas and grilled shrimp salad which are super nom. I was sad I couldn't have the brownie anymore, but if you're going to Cantina Laredo definitely save room for it, it's amazing!!  Price is very affordable and I usually leave with extras for the next day.   Definitely recommend stopping by Cantina Laredo for some awesome Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"This place is nice if you're not wanting authentic Mexican food. I was kind of hoping for some sloppy refried bean and cheese type of deal covered with red sauce.... Something I now know I can't find here. Originally I was disappointed seeing that this place offered more upscale, dare I say it- Americanized Mexican food. I ended up being pleasantly surprised.   The restaurant is very clean, and our server Jackie was very speedy and friendly.   I ordered the spinach enchiladas and my boyfriend had the chicken enchiladas, both were not traditional Mexican food by any means, but were both were pretty good. Once again, not the type of food we were hoping for, but not bad at all.  Jackie recommended the red house sangria to me, and I'm so glad she did, it was DELICIOUS! Definitely the highlight of the meal. This girl knows her sangrias, I would recommend her as a waitress if you plan on stopping in!"}
{"text":"I came here recently with my mother, sister and brother-in-law the day before Mother's Day.  We had originally intended to eat lunch at a different restaurant inside Tivoli, but the wait was too long and we found this place instead, mostly just by following our noses to the amazing grilled chicken smell.  When we entered, the hostess station was empty, so we stood at the front for about five minutes before someone came in to greet and seat us.  The only reason that seemed a bit odd to me was because we did come here during lunch and during lunch there wasn't anybody at the front to seat peope.  When we finally got seated, the waitress took our drink orders while we looked over the menu.  In the additional five minutes it took the waitress to bring our simple drinks to our table (two waters and two iced teas) we had already decided on our meals and ordered.   The food is AMAZING!  The service is subpar.  That's the best way that I can summarize my experience at Cantina Laredo.  The service wasn't horrible, I'll definitely come back, but it also wasn't the sort of thing you expect when you're equally paying for a nicely cooked meal and amazing customer service.  At one point, our waitress hadn't returned and we were ready to leave.  So, we flagged down another waiter and requested a takeout box and extra tortillas from him.  Our waitress DID NOT like that.  She corrected us and then ran down to find the waiter and fulfill our request herself.  To repeat, if you come to this place, you're only really coming for the fantastic food and even knowing that, I completely recommend Cantina Laredo.  Here's hoping in my future visits that the service improves."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a long time and thought we would try it again last night. Based on many of the reviews on here the place is awesome.  All I can say is they have a good writer working for them,  Because it is NOT GOOD AT ALL.   First, service is decent for Denny's trained waiters. This is supposed to be more upscale so they just lack basic training. (I know it is a Mexican restaurant) IE: 8-10 top sat down next to us and waiter stood at kids end yelling specials to the adults at the other end (which our waiter never told us about), empty plates left for long times, ect.    Tables have that bad lacquer finish that always feels sticky, just grossed me out to begin with every time my arm touch the table.  Next salsa is so so, real runny flavor OK, chips were good.  Got a house margarita $8, and it was awful. Tastes like lime aid and bad tequila that sat in a jar in the sun, just nasty. I was afraid to order something else from the bar. You would think an upscale Mexican restaurant could make a good marg.  I had the Carnitas, which in general was OK, except for the ridiculous amount of salt used. I couldn't stop drinking water all night after. It was in the meat so I assume it was the marinade that is used. Portion is too huge.  Wife had the spinach ench, which should could barely eat. Said they were flavorless, no cheese, just not good at all.  Try if you like but a big thumbs down here."}
{"text":"Went here with another couple for appetizers and drinks. Happy hour appetizers were quite good but the mixed drinks were terrible. My dirty martini had the distinction of being the worst I have ever had. My wife's Moscow Mule was more ice than anything else. Literally two sips and then there was all ice. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends earlier this week and I was pleasantly surprised.  The guacamole was chunky and fresh!  The chips are light, thin, and crispy - so watch out, they can be addictive.  I recommend scooping the guacamole onto your chip with a spoon.  Otherwise, you're going to have a lot of small broken chip casualties from the heaviness of the chunky guacamole.    I wasn't too hungry, so I had a chicken salad with cilantro lime vinaigrette, which I would certainly order again.  The atmosphere and guacamole are the highlights of the restaurant.  Cantina Laredo has comfortable seating both inside and outside.  The inside is beautifully decorated in coastal modern elegance!  If I'm ever in the neighborhood, I'll probably come here again."}
{"text":"Fairly priced for very good food, get the guacamole also highly recommended is the tacos de barbacoa."}
{"text":"Coming to Cantina Laredo I am influenced to think that it will be Mexican fine dining. I start with the chips and salsa, typical with Mexican restaurants. The chips were warm and delicate and the salsas offered robust flavor without having an overpowering heat. I am already happy at this point, but then I order the taco de fajita, which are just beef tacos with avacado and sour cream. My tacos come out and it is only 2 corn tortilla tacos with overcooked dry \"carne asada\". The rice and beans that came with it were plain as tab soda. It seems as if the flavor was all added to the beginning salsa and nothing for the food. The tacos were overpowered by the taste of the tortilla which is absolutely sad. The black beans and Spanish rice were on par with store brands, meaning they tasted pre cooked. Overall, the only Mexican flavor in this place are the ethnic waiters who served me, which admittedly did add to the look of authenticity."}
{"text":"The BEST margaritas I've had in Arizona! Sure, the hostess looks like she hates her job but our server was on point! And the margaritas...yassss...oh and the el carbon tacos...spend the extra $$..so worth it!!! I love this place!! #quesoisamaze-balls"}
{"text":"I'm actually really disappointed in the service that my friends and I had tonight especially for it being extremely slow. We ordered an ahi appetizer, three tacos, a fajita entree and the brownie desert. The food was really good. For myself I ordered the three tacos and brownie. The tacos came with rice and beans and I wanted to save room for my desert so I only at one taco and the rice. Took a bite of a second taco but basically had two tacos + the bowl of beans left. I ordered my desert and asked the sever to bring me a box for my food. The server agreed and picked up my friends plates and took them back. Mine was still on the table to be put in a box. He brings out the desert and takes my plate away. My friend and I are under the impression he is boxing my food. Desert is over and I ask the server where are my tacos and beans. He said I told him to throw it away. This is absolutely inaccurate. He agreed to bring a box for my food hence why he only picked up my friends dirty plates and had left mine until desert came. He did not apologize. He looked at me with a blank stare and told him \"well..\" For him to proceed with a solution for the mistake he made. He went to the kitchen and had them make a Barbaco taco, a single taco. My friend and I weren't sure whether we should ask for a manager considering I had two tacos and beans to be boxed and the server replaced it with one taco that I didn't even order. I ordered the chicken... Anyways.  This was kind of a rip off to pay for a $15 3 taco meal to have server make a mistake to throw my food away that was suppose to be boxed and never even apologized. Hopefully Francisco can work on his skills as a server to pay attention more."}
{"text":"We went for dinner this evening, and I have not been there in 6 months After visiting here again from Chicago and WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. I had to,return the Chicken Breast as it,was cold, dry and salty! The service Was poor, my silverware was dirty and we had to ask for napkins and cutlery. my friends had the guacamole which was tasteless and boring with no Specialized taste, I,mean really. You are much better off going to a more Specialized Mexican restaurant like Barrio,at Phoenix.   I DO NOT PlAN ON EVER RETURNING TO THIS REStARAUNT!  it has really slipped and  the quality has gone down hill. you truly should be Ashamed of,yourselves!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today, the food was excellent! Jim had the chicken enchiladas with beans and rice, really tasty. The white sauce was excellent! I tried the beef tacos, very good, love the rice and the black beans, very flavorable! We come back next time we come down!"}
{"text":"The happy hour time and menu selections are good. The chips and salsa were good but nothing to rave about. I had theor mini crabcakes and steak flatbreads that were really tasty. However, I cant give the place more stars b/c the margaritas were terrible. We ordered 6 different margaritas but finished only 2. They were very syruppy and sweet. Ill probably go back to try their dinner menu but not their drinks"}
{"text":"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mr. Mickey Foster GM, for providing lunch for the teachers and staff at Casteel today.  The steak and chicken fajitas were amazing, and with the fresh, green salad, made for a fantastic meal. We appreciate you and your staff for making our lunch for Teacher Appreciation Day a hit.  Looking forward to taking my family there soon!"}
{"text":"Great place, the chips and salsa are always delicious, so that can be counted on.   I ordered the Mesquite Grilled Chicken breast, served with a side of Spanish Rice and fried zucchini. The zucchini was absolutely perfect: Piping hot, but still crisp and flavorful, the Spanish rice was good, not special, but the Chicken breast made up for that.  Besides being deliciously juicy and packed with smoky flavour, it was cooked to perfection. I desire a chicken breast to be cooked just long enough to be done, without losing any juiciness or flavor, and that was exactly what I got. The wait staff is lighthearted and easy to get along with, and very accommodating as well.  Thanks Cantina Laredo!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice and wil go back for a select item or two.  The guacamole, made tableside, is good but frankly we can make it better and cheaper at home.  The ceviche is actually pretty good and worth the visit.  It's tough to find ceviche around here period but this is actually pretty good and a decent portion.  The happy hour tacos are reasonable and not bad.  The margaritas are too sweet because of the sour and fruit juices they add.  They are trying to make something that is supposed to be simple too complicated.  Look at my review on Barrio Cafe as that will explain.  The first time we were dissappointed with the margs ans then next time we asked for them to be made traditionally and they were much better.  The entrees we had the first time we went were average, not great but not bad either.  Be selective but it's a decent place, especially for an app and maybe a drink."}
{"text":"Pretty sure I was here once before long ago, but I really don't remember that visit now.  For Veteran's Day they offered a BOGO entree, so it seemed like a good excuse to reacquaint myself with them.  Before I get into the details, I must disagree with some other reviews here.  They're better than Taco Bell.  That's not a high bar to clear, but they do clear it.   This place seems to be trying to be an upscale Mexican place, but it's not traditional.  They have their own variants of what should be \"classic\" dishes.  In the process they did create some interesting flavors.  I had the carnitas.  Perhaps I should have gotten the chimi since on a first visit I usually use that as a basis to compare to other places.  Supposed to be served with Mexican rice and vegetables.  I expected some seasoned shredded pork, probably some tortillas...not what I got.  I got three small pork chops with a heavy sauce on them.  The vegetable was asparagus.  The rice portion was small.  The flavor of the pork was fine.  Most of the flavor was in the heavy sauce they had with it.  As I said above, \"interesting\".  Pretty good.  The rice was fine.  I'm not a fan of asparagus, so I have no comment there.  Daughter ordered the Camarones Escondido.  She seemed to like the flavor, but for a dish with \"Camarones\" in the title (that's Spanish for \"shrimp\") there were only three camarones in her dish.  The rest was chicken.  She wasn't happy about that.  They skimped on the shrimp pretty dramatically.  They also seemed to use the same sauce as the carnitas.  The arroz con pollo (rice and chicken) was served as a soup.  Never seen that before.  I thought the flavor was pretty good but my wife was less impressed.  My wife ordered the chicken and mango salad.  She said it was \"fine\".  Didn't really seem thrilled by it.  It apparently sounded more unique than it was.  We also ordered the Mexican brownie.  We saw it being prepared at another table and thought it was interesting, so we ordered one.  They bring it to the table, place it on a very hot plate (so it sizzles), put a scoop of ice cream on top, and then poor a sauce (dulce de leche?) around the base.  Lots of sizzling and steam.  The brownie itself was OK.  Not great, but OK.  Frankly I thought they put too much nuts in it.  There weren't just two or three nuts in a bite, but probably closer to six nuts.  In every bite.  I would guess about 1/3 of the volume of the brownie was nuts.  For me that was just excessive.  Service was good.  Appropriately attentive.  No complaints there.  Portions are inconsistent.  Too few shrimp in the shrimp dish.  Not much rice with the carnitas, though the amount of pork was adequate.  Their flavors were fine, but not really \"wow\".  For the prices here one expects more \"wow\".  In my opinion you can get better Mexican food at lower prices elsewhere.  Laredo isn't bad, and they have some different flavors which is a plus, but they fall a bit short on value.  If they are going to charge upscale prices they either need to hit some more flavor notes and/or be a bit more generous in the portions.  A pretty presentation isn't enough.  The flavors have to be there.  Bold, exciting, and at least reminiscent of Mexican flavors (since they are a Mexican restaurant).  Sure, do your own interpretation, but I think one should know \"oh, this is Mexican food\" when one takes a bite.  I definitely didn't feel that with the sauce on the carnitas, yet I did with the arroz con pollo (I got a bite of that)."}
{"text":"I could probably go on about Cantina Laredo forever, I love several of their servers; Nigel, Theresa and Jodi (sp?). I am obsessed with there guacamole which they make table side right in front of you, so you can control how mild or spicy you would like it. They have a great margarita selection, my favorite being the skinny peach margarita, you can't tell that it's 'skinny' at all. They've always been accommodating when having events or large groups here. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"We sat outside since it was a beautiful night. Well bad idea. It smelt off cigar smoke. It was disgusting! The food was ok for me but my husband took 1 bite of his and that was enough for him. It was horrible. Service was awful. Our meal took 2 hours!!! We didn't even have an appetizer!! With 3 kids this service was way too slow. It's like she forgot we were outside! Looked like we were her only table out there. Don't think we will ever go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious steak and chicken meats that came with the fajitas.   Salsa was good as well.  Everything else was average tasting.  No standouts.  Service was slow.  Our waiter busy reading cell phone, sitting at bar.   He walked passed us multiple times without checking in with us as we waited to place our order.  Would not return because we are looking for better."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Happy Hours in town! I can kick myself twice for procrastinating writing this review as I've been at least 10 times! I can honestly say that I've consistently experience five star customer service each and every time! For starters you can't go wrong with almost anything on the menu! Everything is freshly prepared and made so good! The happy hour house margaritas will kick your but! The fact that I don't have to drive allll the way down to the strip to enjoy a great happy hour is seriously a plus! This place is on my top happy hour list in Summerlin followed by kona grill! The freshly made guacamole is amazing and you can have them make it hot if spicy is your thing! Quesadillas are amazing!! The ahi tuna tacos are a knock out! And lastly the ceviche is probably some of the best I've had! I shall continue to dine here and refer many of my friends and family!"}
{"text":"This place is located at SanTan village rest to the Brio Tuscany Grillle. Good place to go for lunch or dinner after some shopping.  You will not find the usual cantina or hacienda Mexican style restaurarán. This is  a nice Modern ambiance with a big bar as you enter. Spacious minders trendy dine in area with table and  booth seating. Light wood accent with dark carpet provides an elegant and modern look ambiance. The ambiance really is nice for a date, friend, family, or business ocasión.  Service is really good. As soon as we sit down, were Seth our server was really oblige, courteous and friendly.  He wax on top of things, refills, chips, and got out order right. Also offered desert Food was good. This is a more modern gourmet. Mexican food.  Really enjoyed the ahí tuna tacos. Great combination of seared tuna, mango and pineapple and pickled onions, served with black beans and Spanish rice.   Tortilla soup was also really good great flavor and spicy with lots of shredded chicken.  We also tried the fajitas. Combination.  There were a good solid fajita the chicken was slightly unseasoned. The spinach enchiladas were great, really creamy and wit great flavor. Finally the cilantro salad was really good salad, good flavor, good size.  Overall,Good dinner"}
{"text":"CARLOS! WORST BARTENDER EVER!!!!!!! If you sit at the bar with this guy you are a HUGE inconvenience for him! With only 2 other people sitting at the bar it will still take him 5 minutes to even acknowledge you! You have to get up numerous times and actually go to him if you need anything! We have unfortunately dealt with this same bartender twice now and each visit was sadly the same. We have always continued coming back because they do have decent food and we love the bartenders Edward and Enrique. But now the last few times it's been this Carlos guy and we will no longer come back. Management might want to do something before he runs all your customers away!"}
{"text":"This place has really begun to grow on me.  My girl and I tend to frequent the happy hour spots here in San Tan Village; used to prefer the Keg for Happy Hour, not a fan of Kona Grill, but this place has consistently provided us a good time at Happy Hour.    I think the service is awesome, 5 stars, easy. Food, 4 stars Drinks, 4 stars Setting/Ambience, 3 to 4 stars.  Definitely recommend...guacamole kinda overrated."}
{"text":"I went to Cantina Laredo one evening after work with a large group (there were nine of us) and had a really good experience!  The food: Not super authentic Mexican by any means but they offer an edited menu that's executed well (in other words, small menu but everything on there is pretty good). The complimentary chips and salsa were replenished frequently - I probably ate like three bowls of chips (they were FREE!). I'm a vegan so I ordered the Tacos de Hongos (mushroom tacos). The balsamic glaze was tasty, there was no cheese on my plate and it was a good portion size.   The service: They were BUSY and thanks to a co-worker having a reservation, we scored a large table in the back. The section we were in had sliding doors so it was obvious they gave us the space they typically use for private dining events. I don't remember her name but our waitress was good - accomodated our requests and offered suggestions. She recommended the mango margarita and it was AWESOME.   Overall, I'm looking forward to coming back for Happy Hour so I can munch on some chips and have a few more mango margaritas!"}
{"text":"Slow service, guac made at your table that tastes like plastic and so so food.  We gave it a couple of tries but won't be back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Carnitas I have ever had. This place is a frequent stop. I wish I could recommend another dish..... But I haven't been willing to forgo the carnitas to try anything else yet. Great staff, very nice environment."}
{"text":"Food is good! A little pricy, but good. Waiter is probably one of the best in Las Vegas: Miguel!!"}
{"text":"It's and amazing place to go if you want a Fancy Mexican Dish. It's very relaxing and they have good costumer service. They're very friendly to you . And they have a variety of different entrees ."}
{"text":"I visited Cantina Laredo tonight with my boyfriend, eager to try a new Crocker Park restaurant.  He's a big Mexican food fan and I'm a little more lukewarm about it.  I ordered the chicken enchiladas for my meal and had some mixed feelings.  First, the enchilada is very very basic, with just chicken inside of a tortilla and a cheese sauce on top.  On my plate, I was also served a mexican rice and black beans.  For someone who isn't super gung-ho on Mexican food and who also doesn't have much of a tolerance to spice, this inauthentic \"Americanized\" interpretation worked for me.  The majority of the flavor came from the rice, which tasted like it was cooked in a salsa verde sauce and had a zesty flavor.  The cheese sauce on top was a little liquidy, but the tortilla was the worst part.  It felt doughy and undercooked.  That being said, the simple ingredients were okay with me.  If the tortilla had been appropriately cooked and the sauce was a thicker consistency, I wouldn't have had anything negative to say.  As far as atmosphere, the restaurant is huge.  It is very modern and doesn't really seem like a Mexican restaurant, but I couldn't really put my finger on what it actually felt like.  The service was good, but almost \"too good.\"  Our server refilled our chips and salsa and took our previous batch while the bowls were still half full. She did the same with our drinks.  I appreciated the quick service, but would have preferred that she asked before replacing our items.  As I said, it is a brand new restaurant, so there are obviously kinks to work out.  I'll definitely be back and will update my review as necessary."}
{"text":"AUTHENTIC Mexican. Loved it.  Enjoyed the guacamole prepared table-side.  All 3 of us loved our meals.  ."}
{"text":"Billed as a gourmet Mexican restaurant, I think of this place not so much as having Mexican food, as having a Southwest / Mexican oriented menu with food items that appeal to meat-loving Americans.  Where else can you get Fajitas Tres - which consists of chicken and beef marinated fajitas style, but also deep-fried bacon wrapped shrimp? They know their market well - nominally Mexican, but tilting toward suburban Americans.  That said, the dish was good - just not \"authentically Mexican\" in any part of Mexico I've visited.  The carne asada was a disappointment - good tasting marinade, but overly salty - and a really poor cut of beef.  Flank steak isn't always prime quality, but you can do better than this.  The tortilla chips were thin and bland - but the two salsas were non-standard, one spicy and quite good, the other black-bean oriented and not so good. The flan was tasty if not smooth (almost gritty in texture), but still worth having. The green rice was fine but nothing special, the black beans pretty standard.  The service was indifferent, and I didn't appreciate the attempt to up-sell every time the waiter came buy.  Despite the shortcomings, I enjoy this place, and it has a nice atmosphere - but it is not gourmet, it is not authentic Mexican, and it is part of a chain.  Think suburban tastes and a pleasant Mexican-themed architecture."}
{"text":"Ok so I went back to this Resteraunt on an invitation from the General Manager. My last visit wasn't so eventful so I wasn't expecting much. I don't know where to start. But I'll start with Mr. Workman. He greeted us at the door got us a nice table away from the crowd and noise right away. Jaclyn came by and introduced herself to us. That's when our adventure began. We ordered our drinks and our food and Jaclyn could not have been more delightful. The drinks were great and the food was delicious and looked like it came out of \"the food network\"  Jaclyn kept working her magic up to the end when she brought out the the big guns \"Pie a la mode\" it was a masterpiece. It was heaven to the pallet and constructed right in front of our eyes. Thank you Mr Workman and especially you Jaclyn."}
{"text":"The happy hour is great. Thursdays is lady's night with half price margaritas. They are also great at the regular price. Don't pass up the guacamole made fresh table side. They use serrano peppers which gives good heat. If you want to kick it way up ask for the Ghost peppers but be careful. The complimentary chips are tasty, not greasy or salty. 2 types of salsas are provided, cold and warm. The Happy Hour menu also has a good variety of food at a 50% discount. The Enchiladas De Pollo comes with a poblano sauce and the portion of 3 was flavorful and sufficient.  The decor was clean and bright. Our servers were friendly, helpful and attentive. We look forward to coming back and enjoying the outdoor patio. Cantina Laredo is a great addition to the dining choices at Tivoli Village. A solid 4 Stars"}
{"text":"Really great Enchiladas, Lamb tacos and salsa!  What a great meal.  Great service on top of that. Hoping we return to Arizona soon. We'll certainly be back here!!!"}
{"text":"Everything here is excellent. I have been  here about 10 times and the fajitas, fish  tacos, and salads are all delicious. The tortilla chips are hot and fresh. They melt in your mouth. The fajitas are more than enough for one person.  The servers are fabulous. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The chile relleno--the standard by which all Mexican food restaurants should judged due to the difficulty in preparation--was soggy with a bland ranchero sauce and stuffed with cheese that quickly solidified into a chewy slug. Stick to the tasty mole sauce, which covered some dry chicken stuffed enchiladas."}
{"text":"Come here for special dates with my boyfriend. We always get something different and it's always pretty good. Most of the time service is good, today they're short staffed so we're bearing with them. I like this place it's got lots of seating always, and solid modern American Mexican style food. The table side guacamole is tasty made to your liking. I love their tinga chicken."}
{"text":"Lovely dinner with family, 8 of us. They gave us a separate room which allowed us to talk. Waiter was great, not overbearing but didn't ignore us.  The chef came out after we ate to see if we liked the food, which we did. I have never been disappointed at Cantina Laredo.  This is a classy restaurant that doesn't break the bank."}
{"text":"We haven't dined here before due to the mixed reviews.  Our family loves Mexican food, and while we prefer hole-in-the-wall taquerias, we'll occasionally dine at some full service Mexican restaurants.  We dined at Cantina Laredo tonight because we were with friends who wanted to eat there.  I was pleasantly surprised when we walked in to find a lively and hip bar and a spacious dining room filled with a good looking crowd.   Service was very good.  Drinks were great.  Food was pretty good.    We started with the table side guac.   Tasty but tiny portions.  The house chips and salsa is really good.  They give you both mild and spicy salsa.    Several of us ordered the carnitas which was delicious.  They are on-the-bone pork ribs served with rice and a nice sautéed veggie mix.    We'll return for sure."}
{"text":"Solid 3 stars for this chain ... Sleek modern interior that was very clean.  Service with a smile is always nice .  The Guac was good as was my Tampico ( chicken, artichoke, spinach, peppers).The teens enjoyed Fajita combo plates -Erich had a grilled steak with jalapeno shrimp wrapped in bacon.Nothing mind blowing about the food -yet no complaints either.  It's a decent place with decent food and good service ."}
{"text":"I was a little apprehensive about this place when the wife mentioned wanting to go.  Shopping center Mexican food seems to be frequently overpriced and sub standard.  I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  We rolled in Friday at happy hour and it was busy, but we still found a spot at the bar pretty easily.  The staff was laid back and anticipated needs well.  I was really impressed by the food on the happy hour menu.  Their margarita game is outstanding.  We had a few drinks and a few apps and got out for a reasonable price.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My husband had margaritas appetizers in the bar area, the bar tenders are great, the patron margarita is perfecto! Happy hour is great and cheap. The atmosphere is perfect, nice Spanish music, staff is friendly and professional and the bar tenders try to socialize, felt like a great local place. We didn't have any entree's but we will be back for dinner soon."}
{"text":"If there was a Cantina Laredo in my home (Los Angeles) I would dine here regularly despite the multitude and variety of Mexican dining options.      Needless to say, when I'm in Scottsdale, I often find myself drawn to Cantina Laredo.    From the moment you're in, to the moment you're out, Cantina Laredo takes excellent care of your tastebuds.  The chips are salsa aren't filler but a real treat.  Their homemade salsas are worthy of bringing in your own jars to export back home -- some of my favorite salsa anywhere.  I believe they have three different kinds.  Their tequila options are wonderful allowing for creative margaritas or a fine neat glass of 100% pure agave goodness.  (I promise to never use that phrase again, sorry Readers.)  The entrees aren't just your common taco/burrito fare.  Using juicy meats, creative homemade sauces, and interesting pairings, Cantina Laredo professes its love for Mexican food and culture -- reminding diners how lovable these things are.  The decor and various areas are all quite nice as well.  An excellent complement to what always proves to be an excellent meal.  _C$"}
{"text":"I went to Cantina Laredo for their amazing happy hour, we sat at the bar and Edward and Carlos were so awesome!!  They took care of getting us delicious margaritas, kept our chips and salsa full, and we received our food orders promptly.  Shrimp Empenadas were to die for!!!  Best food and service, definitely one of my favorite spots in town."}
{"text":"Quite possibly could be thé grossest mexicain food i have ever encountred.  Why serve canned crab?  Why have waiters who talk so fast you keep asking him to repeat what hé is saying yet they dont care and hurry and walk off and there is pleanty of tables so why thé rush to get us Out.? Not good enough for summerlin. They wont last not going back .   And moms who change baby diaper on thé patio is tacky and unsanitary."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a chain. They ask you how you want your steak cooked but it does not matter.. it comes out 'well done' no matter what. And it was over marinated, a bit salty... it got sent back. I went with the Salmon which was much better.  The mango tres leches was much better than I expected."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Got the fish tacos.  Not only the presentation but the flavor was fantastic. Chips and salsa were great and we LOVED the Mexican Apple Pie with cinnamon ice cream - insane.  In the four days we were there, this was one of two of the best meals we had. The other being at Dominick's."}
{"text":"The service was ok - fast and no issues - can't say the same for the people around us who had a train wreck of a server who screwed up every dish at every table.  The food was just okay as well.  I had the carne asada and my wife had the stuffed poblano.  It seemed like the food came out very very quickly but was not hot (but the plates were for some reason) made it seem like they just flopped already prepared food down on hot plates and threw it out of the kitchen.  The seasoning on the steak was nice and I really loved the charred jalapeno.    The salsas - especially the warm salsa was very good but the chips were a bit mealy I did not like their texture.  The poblano pepper was stuffed with about 3 shrimp and the seeds and glans of the pepper were left in which is odd.  The steak was small but adequate.  Over priced for the amount of food you get.  While I didn't hate the place it struck me as someplace I can easily forget and had no real draw on me that makes me want to come back.  Not big on paying over $70 for a fast meal with average flavors."}
{"text":"Super awesome service by Alexandra always!   We always come and stop by for the delicious modelo with the boys-super refreshing.   A must try plate I truly love is the rib eye with cascabel sauce super tender super awesomeness.   Margaritas are always a good drink for the girls and really strong.   The chips and dip are always served with your order of drinks. Super addicting!   All the Platillos del bar (bar platters)  Are always very affordable but happy hour starts at 9pm better prices ;)"}
{"text":"Wonderful! Great happy hour specials. Table side guacamole, street tacos and shrimp flat bread was fantastic! Dinner: if Chilean sea bass is on the menu, order it! Delish. Service was excellent"}
{"text":"I wish I could give more stars because the food was certainly worth it.....but the restaurant staff just wasn't friendly. walked in Sunday afternoon....it wasn't very busy at all. I greeted the hostess she hardly even acknowledged I spoke to her let alone I had two people with me. we were promptly sat but had to wait a while for someone to even come over to us. We were first given the chips and salsa (delish) but no water or beverage....i hate eating salsa without water...what if the salsa is too spicy??? We waited about 5 more minutes before Ramon (our waiter) came over to us...thank GOD he had a personality. we ordered Queso Laredo and table side guacamole...the lady who came over to make our guac had zero personality....I tried to joke with her and talk with her and ...nothing! She did make good guacamole!! Our queso cam out and it was good as well....how can you go wrong with CHEESE!! We ordered our entrees....I was happy to see they had a brunch menu...it includes a mimosa or bloody maria (I wish it would include a margarita....that's what we were drinking) I had the Migas con huevos (a scrambled egg dish that had jalapenos, bacon, and tortillas in it) I added cheese to it (doesn't all mexican food need cheese) and the added 1.45 to the bill....really I wasn't spending enough money??? My husband had the salmon we said it was very good...it came with some sort of rice and myf riend had the ensalada de cilantro pollo...it was a beautiful looking and large salad...she said it was good as well. Margaritas!!! (the whole reason i wanted to go) we ordered skinny margaritas and had them add jalapeno for a little spice....they were very good...in a tall and skinny glass....we only had one each (not sure if I was too full from the food). The food is very good...Ramon was a good waiter....the restaurant needs a more fun vibe....I will go back I love the location and like I said food was great!"}
{"text":"On the list of types of food I like, Mexican is absolutely last. I almost hate it. But after I went to Cantina Laredo, it changed my mind.  The fajitas are the best I have ever tasted. The chips and salsa are awesome.  We didnt get the guacamole, $10 for a dip is a little pricey but whatev. For those who order seafood at a mexican resturant in AZ, you must be out of your minds :) Save yourself and money and just stick to beef, chicken and pork and save your ordering seafood for your vacation to the coast."}
{"text":"Always came here for lunch and never left disappointed, last time I went it was  for dinner by myself and sat at the bar, I was quickly greeted with their house chips and salsa, atmosphere was kinda non existent (maybe bc I came to have dinner at a Mexican restaurant on St Patrick's day) nonetheless my food was tasty (I had the Tampico chicken... stay away from this dish if you're lactose intolerant though lol). Service was okay but my food came out super fast."}
{"text":"I came for Happy Hour on a friday and the place was pretty busy, especially considering Tivoli is a Happy Hour heaven with every restaurant in the plaza offering great deals.  I had 2 very strong margaritas for about $5 each.  I don't think they were the best tasting margaritas in town, but they were pretty strong.  Just like any other Mexican restaurant you get the complimentary chips and salsa.  Their salsa had a nice kick and their Happy Hour tacos were tasty, though a little small.    Most Mexican restaurants taste relatively the same to me and their menus are usually the same fajitas, tacos, etc. type of selection.  As far as a great restaurant, I don't think Cantina is a must try.  It's a nice Mexican variety but it won't blow you away.  The Happy Hour is quality though so come 4-7pm if you want a strong margarita."}
{"text":"I've been to Tivoli a million times, and this is the first time I'd ever been to this place!   The hostess was a little iffy - not very friendly, and a bit standoffish. However, once we were seated, our server was wonderful. He was extremely warm and energetic without overdoing it.   We had the chips and quac - of course - which, like many things on the menu, are very paleo/gluten-free.   I had the Ensalada de Mango y Pollo. This was a great entree salad. Delicious flavors and very fresh.   My friend had the Tacos de Pollo - again, gluten-free.   Had a nice time - very quiet setting for a Monday night. Will return!"}
{"text":"Pretty average to poor.  They try to be an upscale Mexican bistro but really the food is no different than any other chain Mexican restaurant.  The beans were flavorless and too thick.  The cheese enchilada had no finesse--overwhelmed with cheese with a thick enchilada sauce.  Didn't like the margarita either.  I'm not a fan."}
{"text":"Didn't have a great experience here. We stopped in for a quick little after-work function for food and drinks. Service was absolutely terrible. Couldn't get seated within 10 minutes, and it wasn't like the place was bombarded with customers (we later found out why).  After the first round of drinks came, literally 2 of the drinks were not even the right drink. Mine was just fine, but I ordered a beer, so that's relatively difficult to mess up.  The waitress took what I might call a 'long time,' to come back with the correct drinks and to check to see if everything else was okay. The tipping point, however, didn't come until the waitress was dropping off an additional round of drinks and knocked over my beer completely drenching my side of the table. After she made a half-hearted attempt to apologize, I believe we made like a banana and split.  Might be awhile before we return."}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo I was sooo expecting more! Now looking through most of your reviews I see I am not the only one. The place looks nice from the outside and yout expect it  might be good. It is not. It was not even ok in my opinion. Very bland. The chips and salsa were good but that was only thing. My husband ordered a sampler platter they had. Everything was so plain and tasteless and dry. I am a season everything well kind of girl. I ordered the Sea bass. It was ok, but definitely not worth $24 I think the plate was. The steamed veggies that came with were frozen cooked to mush with a lemon slice on top. Pricey and food not very good a combination that never take me back. I don't mind paying for something...but give me quality worth the price. I left mad thinking of all the things I could have spent that $67 on"}
{"text":"I like the review of the whacked waiter... i think he may be still at work at 'Cantina Laredo' cuz i think he served us.......   Called ahead after a Cardinals game to make sure there was room enough for our party of 10-  \" No problem \" we were told , come on down.   arrived 9:00 ish on a beautiful 80F evening in Scottsdale -stepped across a half empty patio into the spacious Cantina - chilled to an ungodly 60F-   Note to the great state of Arizona :   (the reason that y'all are booming and experiencing sustained in-migration is because people are like lizards--- ( in more ways than one)---they like the sun , they like the heat ... they flee from northern climes to get away from the chill - Don't AC your premises such that it reminds us of Duluth in winter.... we just escaped Duluth in winter and fled south to thaw ) .  we asked for a spot on the patio and our man immediately declined stating that \" he had already set a table for us inside\"-   upon my wife's insistence that he reevaluatethe patio  he disappeared for a moment or two and then reappeared - affirming that the half empty patio was indeed full.   this puzzled my wife who then surmised that :   A) he wanted our large party in his section -not the patio  B) there would likely be a built in minimum gratuity on the final bill                                        ( there was)                    after taking our drink order ,(competently),  he returned with salsa and chips. The salsa he described as being of two types \"hot \" or \"regular\"- there were indeed two temperatures -but they appeared  to be seperated thermally rather than chemically -??  the same salsa one served at room temperature , one served chilled...???  when asked about the best dishes for people who wanted a little kick to their food he replied:  \" I wouldn't really know , I don't like spicy food\"   ?????????????????   Dude , can you not at least fake something.... it is after all a Mexican restaurant. If people want spice they go Mexican - if they want bland they seek out a Saskatchewan restaurant - non?   The meal was salvaged - ( not saved), by a compatriot of our man who hailed from Durango- he spoke knowledgeably about the menu , filled our empty margarita glasses and retreated into the kitchen to assemble , on our behalf , a pepper mole sauce that was truely outstanding.  The food was uninspired -( there was a Baja Grill of some sort across the parking lot and we wondered if they shared a kitchen...) , the service was poor ( excepting our hombre from Mejico ), and the casa freakishly cold--  Two stars tops over all but boosted up to three by our amigo from Victoria de Durango"}
{"text":"Very nice place with great service. Hostess sat us right away. The waiter came over right away for drink orders and got the drinks out to us within 5 minutes. It was happy hour and very busy in the bar area. We sat in the restaurant and weren't allowed to order off the happy hour menu. We had a child with us so I guess that means you can't participate with the special menu in the bar. Kind of annoying. But the waiter did give us happy hour drink prices at least. He was as accommodating as he could be. The fresh made chips and salsa were delicious. The spicy salsa wasn't as spicy as it was made out to be but it was very full of flavor. The waiter explained the menu items perfectly. The ceviche was pretty good. I prefer the shrimp cut up but it all tasted good. I had the enchiladas veracruze I think it was called. Chicken, spinach, queso fresco and a very spicy sauce. It was good but I will try something else next time. My friend had the crab enchiladas. It had a fancy name that I can't remember. It was amazing. The waiter said it was really good. A little more expensive than I would've liked but not outrageous prices considering the quality of food and fabulous service. Even when it got busy our waiter was still on top of everything. Overall it was a great restaurant."}
{"text":"The three stars are for service, decor, ambiance and the margaritas.    We started off with some guacamole which was prepared table side.  Sad to say the best part of the meal was made by the server but it's true.  The food was less than meh.  There's no doubt in my mind I was given instant rice and that was the most memorable part of my meal.  I can't recall what I ordered as a main dish.  I think this is a great place for happy hour margs and guac... nothing else."}
{"text":"Their  Happy Hour is great.  My husband and I really enjoyed ourselves here.  The specials are pretty decent.  We had the ceviche for a snack and it was delicious as well as half off the regular price.  We will be back.  The bartenders and waiters were very friendly and attentive.  Not really fond of the modern decor, but that's just my taste.  Very glad to find a new Happy Hour place that I feel comfortable in....."}
{"text":"I cant believe I haven't written a review on one of my favorite places yet! I love me some Cantina Laredo! Andy and I come here all the time, Edwardo is the best bartender ever. We always call ahead to make sure hes working because he truly brings the whole experience together.  The happy hour is amazing here. They have a full HH menu that is 50% off and it includes a few of our favorite items.  The very first thing I have ever tried here still remains my absolute favorite. The Ahi  Mini-crispy tacos with sushi cut ahi tuna, chipotle aioli, jicama slaw and guacamole. The ahi is so fresh and flavorful. The guac is homemade to perfection! On to our second favorite. The Tacos de Barbacoa. Slow-roasted brisket with marinated onions, monterey jack cheese and cilantro. delish! The crab cakes are also very good. But the apple pie... you cant beat. The apple Pie comes in a hot skillet and smokes with Mexican Brandy Butter and topped with cinnamon ice cream. I could go into a diabetic coma and be ok with it by eating 5 of these. And you cant forget about my favorite part of any meal... THE DRINKS! Their house-made margaritas are great. Edwardo was telling us that they do not use sweet and sour, which is great because most bars do. To make their margaritas they actually hand squeeze every juice that goes into them. And you can truly tell. They even have pineapple infused tequila which makes for great shots.  I highly recommend visiting this jewel tucked away in Tivoli Village. Not only is the restaurant stunning, there is so much more to discover here."}
{"text":"A couple of friends had recommended this place, so we finally gave it a shot.  The prices on the menu kind of punched me in the face - because it was hard to believe that anyone gets away with charging that for Mexican fare.  I ordered the enchilada trio, which was immediately forgettable.  The chips and salsa were just okay, and te waitress did a so-so job.    The fun began once we were lured to the bar with the \"Three Amigos\" promo drink (after the meal).    Basically, it's their house margarita, with a Coronita tipped in from above, and a Hornitos tequila sidecar.  This kind of got my night started on the right foot.  A few more of the house 'ritas once reverse happy hour hit, and we were finally happy.  In other words, no reason to go there for the food - but the bartender is great and the beer flows like wine."}
{"text":"This was my favorite spot for Great Mexico food and drinks. I've been coming to this location since 2014. Friday night we went there for happy hour and to my complete dismay they have closed down. We were there just 2 weeks ago and there was no mention of a pending closure.   Even though this is Las Vegas with lots and lots of places to go, this location was very very cool super nice people great food and I feel really bad for the employees that must've lost their job with basically no notice.   I have also heard that Tivoli Village has forced businesses out at lease renewal time with huge price increases. If this is true shame on you Tivoli village management 3/4 of the shops in this location are empty and your jacking lease rates forcing great businesses out."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Tivoli Village. It's high end shops and restaurants are what we enjoy, and it was our first time dining at Cantina Laredo. With the same expectations of execptional food and service toward this location as the others, I would have to say that we were let down with just a mediocre welcome, regular service (nothing more than just what their job description asks for), and a disppointing meal. It was a very slow night, and we were the only ones dining in our area We always have an open mind with trying new foods anywhere we go (certified foodie geeks), but an example of that disappointment was their Laredo cheese appetizer. What sounded like a great precursor, suggested to us by our server, turned out to be melted velveeta cheese and canned taco meat. For such a beautful restaurant in a beautiful location, it seemed so underwhelming. My husband asked for a Bloody Maria and he got a Bloody Mary instead. He drank it anyway, but didn't bother to order any more drinks after that. Luckily, the mole enchiladas saved the day when those were served, but I am certain we will not return. We left with long faces and genuine sadness that it couldn't be better. Total bummer. Oh well."}
{"text":"Last night I attended one of Cantina Larados' Tequila Parties that they hold quarterly throughout the year I came to find out.  All I can say is simply \"amazing\" all the way through the evening.  I started off with a drink (beer) and some chips/salsa and as the guests started to arrive the fun started to begin.  We were treated to a four course meal, consisting of a beef tamale appetizer,  Mexican chicken soup (spicy and delicious), followed by the main course of which I had the pork chop (the other option was fish) with russet Mexican potatoes, and for desert a coffee flavored flan that was out of this world.  In addition we had 4 cocktail style tequila drinks, one grapefruit based, then strawberry margarita, lime margarita and a iced coffee flavored tequila as part of the dessert... YUM!!  To also complement the evening there were three shots of different Tequilas.  I met some interesting and great people and had a very enjoyable evening that pleasantly exceeded my expectations.  My thanks for the outstanding service of the evening goes to Lisa our waitress along with the rest of the staff that served us a fantastic meal.  Lilly was our host and she gave quite a presentation on the history of Tequila that we were drinking throughout the evening.  I definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"Came to Tivoli Village for their fall festival and decided to have a cocktail and some lunch with my parents and little babes. I thought it would be packed around 1pm but surprisingly it was pretty slow and unfortunately the service was the same. We ordered margaritas, one of which was the \"skinny\" and wasn't impressed. The skinny was super sweet and just tasted like sugar.   We ordered the ceviche which was delicious but I would have loved a bit of jalapeño kick as it was very mild. We all picked items from the brunch menu and went with the mimosa as our complimentary drink of choice. Bad choice, it tasted like pure orange juice. We all agreed the dishes were ok but nothing to write home about. The ranchero sauce was the best part in my dish."}
{"text":"I've been several times to Cantina Laredo.  I'd give the bar 3 stars, the restaurant 2. Last night was probably the last time I'll attempt the restaurant.  Like others, we were seated outside on the front patio when the side patio had no tables large enough.  The front patio was loud due to outdoor entertainment nearby.  This wouldn't be bad for a loud party, but we were not, so we asked to be moved inside, and were accommodated.  Service was a disappearing act.  Polite, but tense.  Although we each ordered different entrees, 4 of us received exactly the same thing - fajita tacos with beans and rice.  It having taken too long to deal with changing, we stuck with it.  Overpriced, not much food.    The music inside is loud and disjointed, playing from what seems to be a poorly engineered sound system.  We all found it overbearing.    SUGGESTIONS:  1.  Put large tables on the side patio where people can talk.  Leave small tables where it's noisy, except for one or two for noisy parties;  2.  Train staff on the menu.  If your menu is in Spanish, they need to be able to comprehend enough of the language to know what people are ordering;  3.  Turn down the music.  We don't want to dance.  Grownups like to talk when they dine out.  Grownups pay the bills.  In case there is confusion, it is on this side of the bread that the butter resides.  4.  Maintain a consistent bar menu.  What happened to the Tanqueray?  POSTIVES:  fantastic location open late, even on Sunday (as of this writing) quality of food is good, if overpriced huge place is never full"}
{"text":"I want to LOVE this place.  After all it has huge sentimental value for me, as it's where my husband took me on our first date.  Their cold salsa is amazing and their chips are good, which is the only redeeming food item on the menu.  This last time I went I wasn't starving so I ordered an appetizer.  The description of their ahi tacos actually says \"sushi cut ahi\". What I got instead of thin buttery slices was chunky chewy mouthfuls of horribly cut ahi.  It was disgusting.  To make. matters worse the manager argued with me about it when I pointed it out.  Sadly, memories or not I doubt we will ever be back.  As you can see by the attached photo the chunks were nearly the size of a half dollar and very thick.  I wouldn't even eat a piece of steak that big.  They absolutely overwhelmed the tiny taco shells.  Save your money and eat somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I'm from Texas and am serious about my Mexican food. This place is our favorite Mexican food in Phoenix, hands down! Love the fajitas, the tableside guac, and the margaritas are fantastic. Plus, their service is outstanding. Ordered to go for the family tonight and realized when I got home that I didn't get the whole order. Called and the manager took such excellent care of us!  I can't say enough about this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch today and it took forever to be seated... After finally being seated it took forever to b place our order. .. We hadn't even received water til 15 minutes after brewing seated. .. Some old lady was obviously the waitress. .. It was not busy & she never said anything like I'd be right with you...just ignored us. .. usually when we come we are greeted by a really super nice Latina lady who got transferred to California... Hopefully they get better customer service."}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere. I really liked the chicken mole enchiladas. The prices are quite reasonable for such as upscale place.  I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Seriously AWESOME.  First time here, and it was GOURMET MEXICAN, just as advertised.  Everything was fresh, spiced in unique and thoughtful ways, and presented very well.  I had the RIBEYE.  If you are a carnivore, please eat this.  And thank me.  Oh my dear wonderful god it was tasty.  I ordered it medium rare and it was PERFECTION.  They really have taken some time and energy to make each dish distinctive.  My friend had the Ensalada with Cilantro y Pollo and it was such a surprising blend of so many different tastes.  The chicken had a GREAT chargrilled flavor and blended with all the other veggies.  We totally got suckered into ordering the sizzling ice cream dessert (I think it's just called apple pie on the menu, but my name is \"The Ice Cream SIZZLER\".  We watched the table next to us get presented with this hot stone dish with some pastry + ice cream, and then the waiter poured some delicious sauce all over it, and that damn ice cream SIZZLED.  So sweet, but oh-so-tasty, and even the after dinner coffee was really soothing.  I was so utterly satisfied by every aspect of this dining experience, I just hope they keep delivering!"}
{"text":"Went for fajita Wednesday, it was very good.The chicken, steak, onions and peppers were great Everything was fresh and delicious. Salsa and chips were out standing. What made it even better you were able to dine outside. And what made it perfect I was with my wife"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times already, usually for happy hour. Many appetizers are half-off for happy hours, which is fantastic, because you can order sushi tacos (mini tacos with sashimi) for just $4.50! And they are so delicious too! Who knew that sushi and tacos would make such a great combination?   Another one of my favourites was their tamarindo lemonade. It's normally an alcoholic beverage featuring tamarind puree, lemonade, and some vodka. It's not very strong, and in fact, last time I ordered w/o alcohol because I had to drive, so the bartender was nice and didn't charge me the full price of the drink. I'm so sad though because they recently removed this drink from the menu! I was so shocked! Please bring it back!  Unfortunately, I was not very impressed with their dinner menu. I ordered their pollo con mango mole, and my boyfriend had enchiladas. Both dishes were too salty, and the chicken was dry and flavourless. The only redemption that night was their birthday brownie, which came with a sparkler instead of a candle, quite a novelty. The service has always been great, but I wish the dinner menu was better."}
{"text":"From the outside the place looked alot busier however, Not a bad place to go for lunch on Friday afternoon. Especially when it's close to 1pm as the place was pretty empty. My coworker order brisket tacos and they came out stuffed with tons of brisket. She said they they were very good and I will take her word for it as they looked pretty tasty. Now me, I am not an enchilada person however the enchilada de avocado sounded pretty good as it had two of my favorites stuffed in in, avocado and artichoke. I must admit that it was pretty good. I only finished a little bit of it as I had filled up on the warm chips and salsa that was served when we sat down. Yum.   So why only three stars? Well It's actually 3.5 stars as although the food and the company were great, the service was a little off. Like I said the place was empty and yet our server either forgot about us at times or was busy doing something else in the back. Nicole, our server was sweet enough but still.... hmmm. Oh well no biggie. It was empty and we did get in and out in under an hour but not 5 star worthy. Will I be back again? Probably as the food was pretty good. Heck the chips and salsa alone are worth giving it another shot."}
{"text":"Came here with half the group from poppy den brunch, for some margaritas. Was told they were great, and $8!!!!  The place is so sleek. I was very impressed  with the decor. We sat at the round table right across from the bar. We ordered the house margaritas. Before I say I didn't like them, (I didn't), let me explain.  Hussongs, in Mandalay bay, makes the best margaritas......ever! Simple simple recipe. Fresh squeezed lime juice, homemade simple syrup, gold tequilla and grand mariner floater. That's it. I make it at home and it's outstanding. Nooooooow, when I go out and want to have a rita, they are always lacking. We were lucky enough to get there 10 minutes before their $2 mimosa brunch special ended. We had 2 of those and they were good. The margarita??? Eeehhh. The first, one, I had to send back, was so incredibly sweet. The replacement was better. We didn't eat anything so I'm not sure how the food is. Service was good. I'd go back and try the brunch special, oh, and some mimosas too!"}
{"text":"Great drinks with good location but it ends there. Food was very disappointing for the price point. Giving 2 stars because they actually had some very good margaritas with several creative twists on the traditional."}
{"text":"I should know better than to go out for upscale Mexican. That's like going out for fancy Chinese food -- 99% of the time it leads to nothing but utter disappointment. Cantina Laredo was no exception. It's a great looking spot in Tivoli Village with a cozy patio, but the service and food were a letdown.  I heard guacamole is made tableside. Except maybe if you're dining on the patio? Our order was hastily dropped off by another server/food runner. It wasn't bad and was a large enough portion to feed four. Tuna tacos were ok, but surprisingly bland, minus the guac and red onions. The casarita margarita tasted watered down and wasn't nearly as strong as it should have been. My wife's salad suffered from mushy mangos and soggy greens. But at least the shrimp was good.  I was happy to hear that I could mix and match a taco platter. Unfortunately, these tacos made me crave one found at much cheaper taquerias (Tacos el Gordo anyone?). The barbacoa was my favorite with it's smokey flavor. The carnitas wasn't any better than what I can make at home and the al pastor was average. They would have been good coming from a home cook, but from an upscale restaurant... I expected more.  Our server may have been busy, but slow service is slow service. We didn't get napkins and silverware until after our appetizers showed up -- and we had to ask for them. No offers to refill our drinks until after we were done eating. Our server vanished after we got our food and didn't show up until fifteen minutes after we were done eating. There may or may not have been a good reason for the poor service, but it was bad enough to create a negative dining experience and forced me to do something I haven't done in a couple years... give less than a twenty percent tip. And, ultimately it means there's zero chance of me returning."}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked to try so when I saw they were participating in \"Restaurant Week\" I figured this was as good of a time as any to give it a shot. As I approached our table and saw an avocado and lime waiting at the table I could have sworn they new me well and it was there just for moi! Of course they were on every table but an avocado lover like myself could at least dream of something so simple yet sweet! Chips and 2 kinds of salsas were brought to the table. One I didn't care much for but the other I couldn't get enough of. It had such a freshly made flavor and just the right amount of kick in it. The chips were really good. Included in our RW meal was a \"Casa Rita\" which it isn't for the weak and the freshly squeezed lime juice added just the right touch. For starters we had \"Chile Con Queso\" and Flautas De Pollo\". I have to say the con queso was disappointing. I didn't think it tasted terrible but it did remind me of velveeta cheese. I personally wouldn't order the con queso again. The flautas were good with a tex-mex vibe. I am used to my flautas being made with flour tortillas so it was different to try them made with corn tortillas instead. For my main meal I had the \"Tacos De Carnitas\". I loved it! The pork had such a beautiful flavor. I would for sure order the tacos again. It came with beans and rice. The rice was cooked just right and the beans were beyond flavorful. as if I weren't full enough the meal was topped off with \"Churros\" for dessert. It was chewy and sweet. The grand marnier cajeta dipping sauce paired nice with the churros! I enjoyed my meal as well did the other people in my party.   The service was great and it was clean inside. I saw people in jogging pants and sports bras so I guess there isn't as much of a dress code as I thought. I noticed seating outside that would be great for taco grubbing and rita guzzling should mother nature be so kind to allow it. Our server said they have happy hour Monday-Friday from 4 pm-7 pm and ladies night on Thursday where ladies get 1/2 off margaritas. They gave me a flyer for their e-club with the bill. It says they offer monthly deals and promotions."}
{"text":"This is strictly off my one & only visit so far & not of the actual menu. We were Saturday day drinking, DUH!  Pros: The few happy hour items we ordered, were tasty! The tacos adobada YUM! Chips, salsa & guacamole, nice! The drinks, even better!! Paloma's were finally located, no one in this town knows what they are! The flavored ritas, were ok.  Not So Pros: We had to hunt down a Server after we were greeted by the Hostess and walked thru the bar area past 3 Servers to go sit outside. And still, we had to hunt someone down. Nonetheless, will try it again!  Update: Today Cantina reached out to me via Twitter regarding my review. Because of that outreach I have changed my 3 star rating to a 4 star. One thing I can appreciate is when a business reaches out to their patrons because it means that they REALLY care about what they are doing! As I mentioned to via Twitter, I will DEFINITELY be returning to Cantina! Thank you for reaching out!"}
{"text":"Soooooo good! We went during happy hour with a group so we all got something different from the appetizer menu and everything was good! The passion fruit Rita was amazing and I dont even like tequila. The empanadas were my favorite"}
{"text":"Worst service I have received in a long time.  After being sat outside we had to go inside repeatedly asking if we could get a server. After 10 min someone came with chips and then again no one around for another 15 min. After going inside and asking for help a server came to tell us the table that they say us at was \"reserved\" and asked us to move. At that point we walked out. Seriously doubt we will return."}
{"text":"Wow!  This is my 3rd visit in 9 months.  I don't have plans to EVER go anywhere else for Mexican food again.   I wish I'd taken a photo of the 3 taco plate I just ate.  Not only was it a beautiful presentation and a hearty portion, but the flavors were amazing.  Their chips and salsa are nothing short of PERFECT too.  Even the margaritas are fantastic here.  Living in NY & CA for most of my life, I'm a bit of a foodie and difficult to truly impress.  My first visit,  I had enchiladas and wasn't that excited.  I'm glad I came back & tried other things.  My next visit was for happy hour and I loved the variety of food and unique flavors.  The ahi tuna taco appetizer was incredible.  Today, the bartender Sergio recommended that I try a 3 taco plate, since I am not a big rice and beans fan.  This visit SOLD me on this place for as long as I live in AZ.  I highly recommend Sergio as your bartender too.  He makes GREAT margaritas!  ...but be careful because more than one and you might need Uber!"}
{"text":"The food was OK. It's a bit pricey for the quality. Have you been to a restaurant and already thinking when to come back after you're done eating?  Or the next day you're dreaming about the meal you had?  This is just not the type.  But I might come back someday since I live in Summerlin. Pretty interior and nice location though. This is an amercan-mexican fusion restaurant."}
{"text":"Love their chips and salsa and you have to order the cheese dip. The nachos are always very good and taste fresh rather then other places. The Margaritas are wonderful and their Happy Hour is a great way to check the place out.  The servers are hit or miss. :/"}
{"text":"Service took a long time, food took a long time. The food itself was not Mexican, but probably more Mexican-inspired. Still not very good though. The fresh guacamole made at your table is a fun idea and tasted good but was way overpriced. Probably would be OK if I never went back there again."}
{"text":"Has been our go-to upscale Mexican restaurant but today we were surprised by slow service, warm not hot food, dry fall-apart enchiladas. Consistency of the hot and cold salsas was different than last year too. Although the rest of the mall and traffic was heavy in the area, there many empty tables on a Friday lunch our...Definitely an off day! Server seemed knowledgeable about gluten free options tho."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant last night for the first time during happy hour. What a value and the food was delicious. We will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I love Tivoli Village and was looking forward to trying a new happy hour spot.  This restaurant is very attractive and has a nice layout.  My girlfriend and I sat in the bar and started with chips, salsa and what we thought was a complimentary guacamole prepared table side to your liking.  What made us think it was complementary and a feature of the restaurant was that there was a tip jar on the cart and no mention of the $9.95 charge.  We also ordered the $3 ritas, crab cakes, nachos al carbon (beef), and the flautas de pollo.  Nothing extremely amazing about the food but it was good.  We had no problems with service and I think this would be a great spot to catch the game as a they have a couple large screen TVs.  They also took the guac charge off the bill.  I honestly have no problem with charging for it, my problem is not letting us know beforehand.  I mean we go to happy hours for a deal and that $9.95 gauc charge equals three more house ritas!   I'm pretty sure I will be back and look forward to when the weather is nice enough to sit outside."}
{"text":"I had been here once before but had only had their margaritas which were spectacular! I am particularly fond of their strawberry Margarita. At the time of my first visit, the food looked good as well and I made a note to come back some time.  So, Sunday afternoon and I have a hankering for some tacos. I knew that Cantina Loredo was priced as a fancy pants place but the beau figured he could get something else while I got down on some tacos.   Unfortuntely, I wasn't even mildly impressed with what I considered enchiladas with no sauce. My first Margarita  (ginger, lime, mago), claimed to have ginger beer but all I could taste was the mango, not nearly as good as my dudes (strawberry). By the time I had my second marg (strawberry) I wasn't complaining much about anything.   I chose the Tacos El Carbon for comparing purposes. Nowhere did it indicate that the guacamole, sour cream and pico would be a side item, I assumed it would be on the actual taco... the tacos were rolled and pressed flour tortillas. I went for one chicken and two steak tacos, the steak was over salted for my taste but others may disagree. The rice was good, pretty traditional, the beans we black beans, standard these days and the tacos were not my favorite. I wouldn't really consider them authentic and the flatulence that followed? Look out world! Terrible gas. I would like to say it wasn't lunch but it was very identifiable as Tacos El Carbon.  On another note, the boyfriend had the spinach and mushroom enchiladas and added ground beef. He loved his cheese smothered enchiladas which I would have been highly dissatisfied with, had I ordered the same thing and had I been expecting enchiladas that I am accustomed to. The chips are nice and thin and come with a couple of salsas both of which were good, as were the chips.  All and all, 5 margaritas and two dishes later, we are out the door for about $87. I will not be eager to go back for food although I know the guy and I know where to get a good Margarita now."}
{"text":"In the interest of full disclosure, I am a regular at Cantina Laredo. Don't ask me why it has taken so long to write my review, but as I have said before, sometimes you need to try a place out several times before you can give them an honest review.  My first shout out is to the staff, many I know by name and who know my name as well. There is a reason someone becomes a regular, and the staff at Cantina Laredo has done exactly what you need to do to get customers to come back again and again. 5 stars goes to the staff, and very well deserved it is.  The food is really quite good, but there is the rare occasion when the kitchen sends out something that just doesn't appeal to the eye, even if it tastes great. Sorry guys, but presentation matters. As I said, this happens only on a rare occasion, but it is the reason I cannot give a full 5 star review.  Tivoli Village can be an adventure when it comes to cuisine. Some places serve amazing food with top-notch service, some places have pretty good food at really good prices, while other places charge ridiculous prices for some really marginal food. But fear not, it's really very easy to tell these places apart - just take a look inside to see what kind of crowd they have.   Some people slam services like Yelp, claiming that average people making reviews is completely untrustworthy, as if regular people don't have the ability to recognize quality and service. But if you walk around Tivoli village on an average day during happy hour, the crowds in each restaurant very closely match their Yelp reviews. Some restaurants are nearly dead, while others are filled to the brim. A closer look at their Yelp reviews will tell you all you need to know - the average person really does know what their talking about.  Cantina Laredo is one of those places that is filled to brim during happy hour, because they serve good food at great prices. It's still funny to me to see their patio filled up with smiling people, while its neighbor's patio is completely empty - but then I shouldn't be that surprised,  I've had their neighbors food."}
{"text":"This place is not for me. For being a higher end Mexican food place, this place is average at best. Appetizers leave you disappointed and the entrees are ok, but doesn't wow me. I don't mind paying the higher price of the food matches it. In my opinion, the food at some burros is a better quality and better tasting then here. I can tell you that I am disappointed. There is so much potential here, but the food doesn't cut it. You could tell that I am not the only one. On a Sunday, most places are hard to get into for lunch. This place was only a quarter full and it still took 20 min to get a table. I believe if the food changed, this place would be unstoppable. Until then, I can't come back."}
{"text":"Nice place but the food was only mediocre and on the pricey side. . Ambience was good"}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food in an area in Vegas where I don't expect to find authentic Mexican food. Love the location in Tivoli village, very nice atmosphere, LOVE their happy hour, went with a group of coworkers and had a nice time. I recommend going here with a large group of friends or family, the menu is solid, I had mostly apps, but all were decent nothing that blew me away. I'll go back with friends for sure."}
{"text":"We had never heard of Cantina Laredo.  We were out bike shopping yesterday in Gilbert and it was lunch time and we wanted to try this restaurant.  Being vegans makes it difficult to eat out.  The Manager, R.J. was very accommodating to our diet needs and our waiter, Jon brought out two delicious, nutritious meals for my husband and myself.  Cruelty and cholesterol free! No dairy and no meat!  We had a spinach artichoke enchilada with a side of rice and zucchini and we also had a chili relleno with fresh mushrooms and other roasted veggies.  It was a hearty and fresh meal. The ambiance is very nice too, even cloth napkins which you don't find much anymore.  I'd recommend this restaurant to vegans especially with the employees willingness to cater to our dietary wants."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the service was amazing our waiter Ryan was very attentive. Will definitely comeback soon."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a late lunch today and there was plenty of seating considering today is the last Saturday before Christmas.  We sat in the dining area which was very nice and clean.  Our menus had stuff on them, though... ewwww...  The chips and salsa were good.  The chips were warm, one salsa was heated and the other cold and tomatoey.  The iced tea was pretty good.  I ordered the avacado/ artichoke enchiladas.  They were sooooo good.  They came with this vinegary cabbage/onion salad on top of spinach and a jicama, carrot, mango salad.  A friend had Chicken Mole enchiladas which were sooo delicious, I wished I had ordered them, too.    M ordered steak fajita tacos.  The steak was smokey and rich.    No room for dessert after these meals."}
{"text":"I had a delicious dinner here with my mum today. We both had tacos: I had the mahi-mahi, and ma had carnitas. The food was quite delicious and very filling. The fish was well cooked, and the crema we asked for was fresh, creamy, and delicious! My mum reports the carnitas were fantastic, well cooked and savory. That said they could have been a little larger I think. For almost $15, I think that there either should have been 4 mini tacos, or the tacos should have been bigger. They were beautifully presented, although I didn't particularly taste the chipotle aioli in my taco.   The service was neither good, nor bad. It was a little slow (considering there was almost no one there when we went) but it was a nice day to sit outside, so it didn't bother us too much. It took a bit too long to get water or refills, but the waitress was nice and friendly. I took the star off for a combo of slow service and maybe just a bit too little food for the price.   I love that their menu has gluten free options! Makes it easier for us Celiacs to eat safely! I would definitely recommend this place, but maybe more for lunch. As it was I felt really good after eating here (which rarely happens when I go out) so definitely Celiac approved!"}
{"text":"Over priced, but the salsa is really good.  Best for Happy Hours."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant.  Great food.  Great service. What more could you ask for.  I read a review below that said the portions were small.  Um... not sure how much that person eats but there was definitely no issue with portion size at this restaurant. I had the Fajitas... they were fantastic!  We also did the table side guacamole, and of course this was after the complimentary chips and salsa you get first.  And they give you two types of salsa, one medium, one mild.  For dessert, the Flan!  Everything was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Dined here yesterday for lunch/happy hour.   While the server was friendly, the bar was understaffed which amounted to horrendous service. We were not in a rush, but it took nearly two hours to complete our experience. We had two drinks each, guacamole, one appetizer each, and the apple pie dessert. It was entirely unreasonable for everything to take so long. If you are advertising a happy hour, you should expect a crowd and staff your restaurant accordingly.  The food was, in averaging everything, acceptable. Guacamole was terrible. Flatbread was good. Apple pie dessert was excellent. I would have returned to try other items if not for the rest of my experience.  After several hours, I came down with food poisoning. While I dine out often, this was only the second time in my life that I have had food poisoning. I am sorely disappointed in this restaurant, will not be returning, and will be sure to warn others not to dine here."}
{"text":"The BF and I just love this place!  Fabulous margaritas....and cheap during happy hour!  Great chips and salsa, and tableside guacamole.  The Enchiladas de Avocado is our favorite entree.  It comes with this amazing jicama salad which I think I love even more than the enchiladas.  Service is always good....everyone's friendly.  Bartenders are great too.  This is our go-to margarita spot!"}
{"text":"Sooooo sad this place closed. It was our favor place for Mexican food. We drove quite a ways from home for the good food. Excellent chips and salsa, too. Bring it back!!"}
{"text":"Cantina has been a favorite since I moved to Gilbert four years ago. The food is so consistent and the service is good. But now Cantina is also my go-to for happy hour. My friends and I try other places, but always come back to Cantina. The vibe is just right and the food and drink are always good. -And Duke is seriously the best bartender ever. Even if the food was so-so, we'd go back for Duke. =)"}
{"text":"We have been here plenty of times and decided to stop in at 4 on a Sunday after Christmas shopping for happy hour.  They had a giant Happy Hour sign outside the door and in we went!  When we ordered margaritas we were slapped with the notice that they were not on happy hour pricing on Sundays. Wait.  What?   But that bait and switch sign outside didn't mention that.  Bloody Mary's and Mimosas were the only HH things on Sunday.  What the heck?     We drank and paid and bailed.   There are plenty of other restaurants that offer better HH and I would recommend going there instead of here....unless you want to get duped."}
{"text":"For the zip code, this food and menu selection is great! If you come, try the happy hour  short rib tacos ... sooo good"}
{"text":"Bit pricey but very good. My friend had the artichoke and avocado enchilada. I had the Enchilada Veracruz stuffed with chicken, spinach and monterey jack cheese. Hers was better. Nice environment. Bit far for me but might stop by if in the area. Need to check out their happy hour."}
{"text":"They earn 2 stars for their chips and Salas's. Otherwise it was a 1 star experience. We asked for recommendations on the menu that were fish or vegetarian and the bartender had to look at the menu to make recommendations. This is a total turn off for me because I am a literate adult and am able to read the menu. The bartender went on to mess up our order and then ignore us in a nearly empty restaurant. The only saving grace was the chips and salsa. So much potential but terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Their happy hour food is great.  I love the pastor tacos are great and they can make a great lemon drop.   I do not care so much for their house margarita so I wish they could change that up a bit."}
{"text":"This place is good. The margaritas are very strong. They have a patio with a fire going. I have been here two times and both times were good. If you go here and the special  of the day is the halibut with red pepper sauce, get it if its not the special ask if they can make it for you! This halibut dish is awsome! The second time i went i was not real hungry so i got the Bondera Platter. Its a lot more food then I was expecting. Its $13 and you get two small soft corn tacos with pork, half a chicken quesadilla, two shrimp, two pieces of grilled beef, two stuffed jalapenos, grilled veggies, quacomole, and queso dip. Lots of food for the money. The quacomole is so good, not much to it but its just so fresh. The service is ok and the decor is nice, a little on the dark side and they have big booths that will seat six. They have a good size bar and a few bar tables right indise the door.  Nice place, good food, fair prices."}
{"text":"Great ambiance for seating in the back area of the restaurant. Great authentic Mexican food! Chips & cold salsa on point. Guac needed salt but was good & tacos de fajita were delish. Topped it off with a Strawberry mojito."}
{"text":"Incredible service! So happy we stopped here. The portions for the fajitas are big, and could feed two. On the other hand, the ahi tacos are three smaller tacos and perfect for that fit woman in your life. Atmosphere is great for having conversations (I hat places that are too loud) and the price for everything was just right."}
{"text":"Great spot to go to for lunch.  Was in town for a business meeting.  Great portions for lunch.  Service was spectacular.  Wasn't a fan of their salsa, but the chips were very good."}
{"text":"atmosthere was nice, service was amazing and the food was really really good.  Initially I thought the prices were a little high but after eating the food, the quality was great and well worth the money!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot, very tasty margarita and bloody mary.  Food was just the right portions and just the right spiciness on the salsa.  Wish there were bigger than 19\" TVs in the bar, but that a minor knit"}
{"text":"Love cantina!  The service is always exceptional,  chips and salsa are amazing, and the Margarita's are the best!!  They are a bit pricey so I would highly recommend their happy hour ($3 margaritas) and their brunch on Sunday is very good.  This place is always my first choice for good Mexican food."}
{"text":"We went to Cantina Laredo for lunch. It was our daughter's birthday and she picked the restaurant. We've eaten there before and we're suckers for the table-side guacamole. We ordered it again and it was tasty. Service was spot on and the drinks were great"}
{"text":"If you are wanting great mexican food but are tired of the common chimies and enchiladas, Cantina Laredo has so much more. They have a great menu with authentic flavors. The chips and salsa alone are amazing. I also recommend  their cocktails. This place is a must for relaxing Happy Hour!   My only reason for a 4 star review is since I have been there a handful of times, I have experienced a long wait time for the server a few times. I feel I catch myself trying to hunt for them or flagging another one down for a refill. Even when it is not a busy time."}
{"text":"I was here with twenty something ladies for a bachelorette party. We were planning on going to another establishment but they called us THAT DAY and said that they were no longer in business and we'd have to move our party somewhere else. We called this place in a panic and they were able to take care of us last minute. Ding +1  The staff was competent, efficient and didn't mind how loud and drunk we were being. The food was reasonably priced and tasty. For an appetizer they brought out this delicious queso - which in my question kicks Chili's ass any day.  Ding. +2  I don't live here but I'd say since I only paid $10 for my meal (someone else got my drinks) and I left stuffed and happy, I would recommend this place.  Ding. +1  Star total = 4"}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Arizona I was looking forward to some quality Mexican food, and was rather disappointed with the fare from Cantina Laredo.  The hot salsa and chips immediately brought to the table were delicious, as was the fresh guacamole made table side but it pretty much went downhill from there.  I ordered queso chicken tacos which were nothing more than a grilled chicken breast sliced and put in 3 small taco shells and a side of queso, no lettuce, no tomato, no NOTHING.  For a mere $17...  Other people in my party got different types of fajitas which were good but still overpriced.    All in all this place is overpriced for what you get.  I don't mind an expensive restaurant but I expect to get what I pay for and Cantina Laredo just doesn't make the grade."}
{"text":"Went here with my husband for the first time a few days ago, and I have to say I was impressed! However, I'm shocked to see so many comments about the atmosphere. It was okay...the fire places were beautiful however the walls are very bare, very paneled, very sterile.  Hang some art work! And the music did not match the decor at all. It was mariachi music that felt like I was at Filibertos...not classy at all.  However, I was very impressed with the food. Great salsa and chips, good margarita (pomegranate) and excellent shrimp salad! Shrimp, jicama, walnuts, mango and goat cheese with a cirtus dressing. It was worth the $14 price tag! Would recommend to any salad fanatic. Husband had the fajitas and wasn't as impressed. Overall, good food and drinks, terrible art decor and lousy music playing, but 4/5 for that salad!"}
{"text":"Love this place - we go here all the time - the apple dessert is the best ever - it's now our favorite dessert - we usually get the mango salad & enchiladas with white sauce are yummy - highly recommend"}
{"text":"Omg I love this place bartender Jose is amazing down to earth and helpful will came back another time!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant -- and they have weekend happy hour! They make delicious table side guacamole and their chips  (thin and crispy) are out of this world. I have yet to try something I didn't enjoy, from their appetizers to their desserts. A must for lunch if you're shopping San Tan."}
{"text":"Service was horrible! We sat at the bar thinking it would be quicker. However the bartender seem to be taking care of the entire restaurant. Food was good but nothing great! Don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"I love everything in Tivioli so it wasn't a surprise that this place exceeded my expectations. We came in late around 9:30pm and the bar was packed. Someone immediately greeted us and helped us find a seat in the dinning area instead. Our server Eric was very attentive and friendly, he helped me pick out a light gluten free dish. Most servers get irritated when I order because I'm pescatarian, gluten feee and never order a full dish.  I ordered their ahi tacos off the tapas menu since they are light and also happen to be gluten free. The tacos exceeded my expectations, they were delicious. Even fb he manager stoped by our table to make sure everything was okay. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am updating my review. Today is May 27, 2017 . This restaurant used to be one of our go-to places for great Margarita's and Mexican food. It had been a while since we had visited when we had a taste for some Mexican cuisine - fajitas and tacos. I have never been so disappointed. I ordered fajita-style tacos with flat iron steak. The tacos came and there was more lettuce than anything. What was supposed to be flat iron steak was actually a bland ground steak with no flavor, and not much of it. They added potatoes to the ground steak, perhaps so they could extend the filling and use less of the bland ground steak? I don't know, but I picked out the potatos. The retried beans were bland, as well as the rice. My husband was just as disappointed with his meal as I was - the flavors just weren't there and the portions were small.  We won't be going back or recommending this restaurant."}
{"text":"I chose this place for a group of us to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday (as we had been to Maggiano's twice in the past month I wanted to find something new).  I was very surprised at how good it was.  They were extremely accommodating to a large group (15) and the food was great.    While it is a little more upscale for a Mexican place there were some well price dishes.  The closest comparison for me is Z Tejas.  The combination plates they have are terrific value as I got two tasty enchiladas and a steak taco al carbon (rolled soft taco basically) for 12 bucks.  The margaritas (starting at $8) hit the spot and are even better if you upgrade the tequila to any from their large selection for just $2.  Well priced beers (for N. Scottsdale) at $4.  Guacamole ($7) tasted amazing and was a nice little treat to have it made fresh at the table.  The entrees ranged in price from $10 to $25 and had something for everybody.    Very attentive service for such a large group (although towards the end they were a little overbearing as they wanted us to get the hell out).    Highly recommend to anybody.  Will be nice when they open another one on the East Side of town (planned for Spring 08 in the San Tan Keirland wannabe)"}
{"text":"Now that I've dined at Cantina Laredo a handful of times, I'd say it's the place I'd recommend for people looking for a \"nicer\" Mexican restaurant. The best way I can describe it is to say that it \"fits\" in North Scottsdale. Although Cantina Laredo is not (as of yet) a chain restaurant, it definitely has the polished, upscale, corporate feel of let's say, for example, Cheesecake Factory... but it's quality Mexican food.  Every time I've ended up at Cantina Laredo it's been lunch... as odd as that happens to be for me. On one hand, this means I've had the benefit of lunch portions and lunch prices... on the other hand, it means I've never seen the diner menu (I'm assuming the short menu I have seen with the low prices was for lunch only). As of writing this review, there are many excellent two item lunch combos for $7.99.  As with most Mexican resturants, the meal began with tortilla chips and two kinds of salsa... only this time when they said one of the salsas was \"hot\" they actually meant temperature. They were equally spicy, but one was served warm. The flavors of the salsa varied greatly, which was appreciated.  The first time I dined, I had two cheese enchiladas with rice and beans (of which you get a choice between three varieties). I was nervous when the plate came to the table because it looked like they were drowning in red sauce, but they turned out to be excellent. The cheese managed to keep a great deal of flavor and the sauce turned out to be thicker than it first appeared.  Today for lunch, I had a cheese enchilada and beef taco combo. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the beef was what many other lesser Mexican restaurants would describe as \"steak\" although it also felt a little drier than I would've liked it. I still managed to \"clean my plate\", hence the positive review. My dining companion had a chicken enchilada and chicken taco combo and was very pleased as well.  This brings us to the desert tray. I did not have room for desert at the end of my meal... in fact, I ate waaaaay too much, but I passed the tray on the way to my booth (it's very strategically located so you see it before you start your meal). With the caveat that this is totally hearsay, I have it on \"good authority\" that the double chocolate cake is nothing short of amazing. Next time I go I think I'm going to leave room for either that or the flan."}
{"text":"Great upscale tex-mex cuisine and great service as always. I always leave with food as the protions are generous. The apple pie dessert is phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful delicious Mexican restaurant with excellent service.  This is our go to restaurant when we are in town.  The guac is freshly prepared in front of you, and it's the best.  Their portions are quite generous.  We'll return again next time."}
{"text":"Ordered swordfish.  Free appetizers all you can eat chips and salsa.  Drink- 3 amigo.   Pros- swordfish is delish and well balanced with rice and asperrigous.  Chips are unlimited.  3 amigo is my favorite drink now.  5 stars.    Cons- salsa was too spicy. Portion was less than expected.  Service was acceptable, but slightly higher in price.  3 stars."}
{"text":"I stumbled onto this restaurant last St. Paddy's day while in Chicago. I was in love! The decor was awesome, the food great, but the margaritas was what won my heart. Housemade margie mix, and no fake stuff.  I love the tableside guac and the chips and salsa are deeee-lish. One of my favorite meals is chips & salsa and margaritas. Be careful, two drinks and you're making new friends. Sit at the bar and talk to Jennifer. She's the best!  I want to come and try brunch!"}
{"text":"The service was slow even though the restaurant was less than half full and the food (fish tacos & table-side guacamole) was fair. Not as good an experience as at the Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Visited Cantina Laredo Westlake on Friday 6/29/2018.  We were early, before 6pm, but the place was already bustling.  We were seated in a busy area, but the drinks, food, and chips were good. And service was quick.  Laura was our server and she we great.    The only problem we had was with the bill, which we paid for with a credit card.  I have alerts set ($0.01) on my credit card and the amount of the meal was debited when we paid, but the TIP was never debited. Apparently the way they handle credit cards is to debit the meal at the time of payment, but to save up the tips and debit them at the end of the night?   At least that's what I was told when I went back to talk to them about it, because the TIP that we left was never debited.  I checked again, online, 2 days later, the the TIP has not yet been debited.    Maybe this is standard practice in the industry, but it is news to me and I don't like it because: 1) this means they recorded and reused my credit card number; and 2) in this case, I effectively stiff the server (Laura) because the credit card was never debited for the amount of the TIP.   I call the restaurant on the phone, and went back in person the following day. They don't seem to think this is a problem, but 2 days later, I left an comment on the corporate site to see what they think of the matter.  To summarize: service was great; food was okay; atmosphere was a bit noise; and they seem to be still shaking out some bugs with their credit card transactions."}
{"text":"Just ate here last night..The food is ok. The environment is nice, however, the food is not up to to par with the environment, much less the price. If you are looking for real good and tasty Mexican food, this is not the place. I had Veracruz enchiladas and were not quite what I expected or was looking forward To having. I will say that the chips and salsa are really good!  If you like a sweet taste in your food, I think this is your place. Personally, I have experienced way better Mexican food, in other restaurants here in the valley at a much more less price :)"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and don't really get sick of it. The bar is a pretty cool oval shape and is the center of He restaurant but not too bar-ish hahaha. The ambiance is cool and my wife is enjoying her margarita in ladies night."}
{"text":"i love coupons. apparently the server at cantina laredo doesn't. i presented mine (free guacamole!) and she looked horrified but returned a few minutes later with all the proper ingredients. it was fun to watch the guacamole mashed together right in front of our eyes. we dined with some out of town guests who found the guacamole presentation exciting ... i fear that until friday night they had never been introduced to it.   our out-of-towners are not familiar with the mexican food the way most phoenicians are and asked *lots* of questions that were met with nothing short of annoyance from our server. then my dad demanded the server re-explain an entree for my mother, who \"might\" want to order it (she didn't). yes, our table was probably a pretty annoying one to be stuck with, but that's part of being a server. suck it up. i'm sure you dealt with people far more awful than our group before.  our food arrived within a reasonable length of time. the server and her helper had a hard time figuring out whose food belonged to whom - fine at applebee's, but i expected that this place would match the entree to the diner with ease. the food, admittedly, looked great. i had the fiesta chicken salad, complete with not ripe avocado and delivered with the wrong dressing. i ate it anyway. chicken was way too salty. hub had the carne asada steak. it was served charred but tasty, and portion was really small. we just didn't understand how that cheap cut of meat could fetch $18.99. i can't speak to what the other 5 in our group had; i was focused on choking down my salty chicken.   after our food was delivered, our server failed to appear again until she asked if we would like dessert. i could have used another vodka tonic 20 minutes earlier and a water refill. dessert, a chocolate nut brownie thing with ice cream, was created table side and everyone agreed it was the best part of the meal. my bottom line: the food we ate was overpriced. our food was just ok. service sucked. there's no reason to go back."}
{"text":"I love this place and the food. I've been there 2 or 3 times and ate in a booth and at the bar.  Great food, good service, reasonable prices during happy hour.   This review from 2011."}
{"text":"Been here twice now - friendly staff, nice environment with a good choice of Margarita's and more. I was given a free guacamole coupon at the nearby Hyatt Place (ask for one!) and so started with a free dish of table side guacamole (3 avacodo's) followed by taco's with all the trimmings and two excellent margarita's. then a free Hyatt shuttle to a good night's sleep!"}
{"text":"I love their food every time I go there. Not exactly authentic but very tasty food. great happy hour including reverse happy hour.Strong margaritas. The place is well taken care of and always clean"}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing Sunday brunch. You will not be disappointed!  Try the \"migas con huevos\" comes with a complimentary mimosa or Bloody Mary. The Bloody Mary is delicious. Can't wait to come back next Sunday."}
{"text":"I first had dinner at Cantina Laredo in downtown Ft. Worth, Texas, years ago. I've been hooked ever since. So, I was pretty excited to see that they had a location in Gilbert, Arizona - of all places!  Food is excellent, drinks are strong and delicious and Jaqueline, our server, was oustanding! She made our entire night enjoyable!  Will return as often as possible! Thanks for bringing a little Texas with me to Arizona!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday night with friends. We were a party of 5, with four adults and one child. First off, the place is gorgeous, beautifully, minimally designed with lovely fireplaces and firepits at just the right spots.  The margarita I drank was very good, nothing outstanding. In Arizona, you better make a better-than-decent margarita or the sheer volume of competition will run you over.  Our friends who live there ordered their usual, the Monterrey, and they loved it. I had one of the restaurant's specialties --- Ribeye Cascabel --- and I was greatly disappointed.  First off, the ribeye is supposed to be one of the most tender cuts of meat from the animal, but nobody told these guys. This was an overcooked, tough piece that was chewy, chewy, chewy. And the cascabel sauce it was supposed to be \"basted\" in, well, bathed is more like it. Swimming? Drowning? And the sauce was all pepper, no subtlety; two bites into it and my tongue, mouth and lips were burning.  They charge $24? For this? \"Meh\" indeed.  We didn't stay for dessert and frankly, I wouldn't go back. C'mon, with all the \"gourmet\" Mexican available in the Phoenix area, why bother with this place?"}
{"text":"So we came here for the food and wine festival and it was a huge let down ... they didn't have anything pre arranged for this event. They had alot of people specifically for this event and they didn't even have set drinks ( mimosa/bloody Mary's) pre poured so there were unnecessary lines for drinks !! The food I've been waiting over an hour for food from the kitchen. They do have a buffet but it basically had eggs fruit and biscuits ... not very well rounded. The execution was terrible so it will be a long time before I come here for another food and wine festival !!"}
{"text":"Service is by far the best thing about this place. Second would be the decor. This place is gorgeous inside. The guacamole, chips, and salsa I really liked. Had the chilaquiles with verde sauce. Not a big fan of this take on chilaquiles. Put two fried on top and it would be better. The potatoes are not good at all! The breading that is put on the potatoes ruins it. I should have gotten tacos."}
{"text":"Completely worth coming here, not only is the staff extremely friendly and knowledgable about every dish and the ingredients that go into making it, but it's truly phenomenal food. Prices are pretty on par with the food quality, anywhere from $12-$30 but I promise it's worth every penny. If drinks are your thing, the blood orange sangria and the casa-Rita are amazing.   Tourist or local, this place is every bit the Mexican food experience that I was looking for. Fresh, authentic cuisine, delicious seafood, phenomenal atmosphere and presentation! Will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Ghost town! Came in Saturday night at 7:30, had a reservation but it was clearly not needed as only about 1/4 of the tables were taken (maybe we should have taken this as a sign and left). I tried to order the spicy cucumber margarita but the waiter talked me out of it- as a new item in the menu that was weird to me but whatever. I opted for the pineapple margarita and the wife got the regular margarita; we ordered queso as well and waited. The drinks were fine, nothing special and soon enough our server came back to take our order. We both got a combo plate, Cancun and Puerto Vallarta. Shortly after we ordered, maybe 10 minutes, our food came out- no queso which we mentioned to our waiter and he said he would get it out right away but we didn't want it at that point. The food was ok, again, nothing special. For a Saturday night we were shocked at how empty it was (maybe MDW was the reason but who knows). We probably won't be back as there are much better options nearby but if you're looking for somewhere to just show up at this may be the place for you."}
{"text":"Modern Mexican. Hella good. I got flautas appetizer but it ate like a meal. Good kids meal. Mole enchiladas were also on point. They bring you two salsas and chips when you sit down. Both were really yummy. I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the service and the time it took to be served. Food was mediocre, lacked flavor and a bit dry...(chicken quesadilla, mahi-mahi tacos, fajitas). I prefer authentic mexican food...Leticia's in NorthWest.  I expected more from Laredo Cantina...we weren't greeted with a smile, the server didn't refill our drinks, we had to wave him down a few times. The prices were decent however the portions were very small. I highly recommend for you to go elsewhere. Cafe Rio or Leticia's...Oooh Yeah!"}
{"text":"So I have been lured back several times......  It's such a scam they suck you in with the fancy menu and these Fab chips and salsa, trust me after eating those you'd expect to the food to be pretty damn good, but NO ,to Quote Jenn H.  it is  \"Blech. Die.\"  If and when I come back I'll stick to the chips and salsa, I also would usually order the table side gauc , but have found that they put such large chunks of onion and jalapeno it really takes away from it.......take your time chef and finely chop that shit!!  I'll give 5 stars for the chips and salsa and 1.5 for the food, but you can't have both!"}
{"text":"We are big fans for Cantina Laredo.  Excellent bar menu and great margaritas. Service is usually spot on. Food is fresh. Tonight we waited at the bar 20 before I asked if we could get drinks. Then another 10 before they came. When food was served was very disappointed when frozen chicken that had been warmed up was on our food. Bad experience!  I hope this is a fluke as it is one of our favorite date night places because we can hang out and catch up."}
{"text":"CAUTION:  my review is more about payment security than food/service.  Food/Service were ok btw.    Our credit card was hacked after eating here.  We know it was this restaurant as we did not use card other places.  After talking with manager next day, she said they had problems in past. What???  Enough said.  Pay cash is my advice.   At least they were polite about it, but nothing more.   I wouldn't avoid the place, just be aware."}
{"text":"The staff at this location is excellent. Although I have not eaten here for lunch or dinner (as this is primarily a happy hour destination) the happy hour menu is sure to have something for every one. I have not had a bad dish from this menu.   Another fine point for me is that they serve onion free fire roasted salsa, this is very important as my date is 'onion averse'.   They also make great 'PERFECT PATRÓN MARGARITAS' which is made of Patrón Silver and Patrón Citrónge."}
{"text":"I loved having my wedding reception lunch here! They were amazing and the enchiladas were to die for. I loved the spicy quesadilla. All of our guest loved the lunch and drinks. The desert was amazing and the staff were always on top of everything. I will never forget it!"}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere. The food and drinks are way overpriced though. If you like your Mexican food mild to bland, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Our meals were OK and service started out well and then went downhill.  I should have paid more attention to the reviews of my two friends on Yelp.  Live and learn.  We were here about 4:15 yesterday afternoon and there were very few people there.  We were seated immediately and brought menus and drinks.  The chips and salsas were brought and our server explained that the warm salsa was spicy and the cold salsa was not spicy.  The chips and spicy salsa were good.  The chips are very thin and I found I broke several in half dipping them in the salsa.  For our dinners, I ordered the Tacos al Pastor.  Here's the description from their menu:  Spicy pork with pineapple, pico de gallo and cilantro.  My wife ordered the Tampico which is described as: Grilled chicken breast topped with sautéed artichoke hearts, mushrooms, spinach, red bell peppers with sour cream-poblano sauce and monterey jack cheese.  My tacos were just OK.  The biggest problem with them was there was only one taco.  When I get tacos like this at genuine Mexican places, they're always doubled so there's some body to help hold the filling.  With my tacos and the single shell, the pico was wet enough that it softened the taco and made it almost impossible to pick up to eat.  I did eat the first one that way but I was awash in juice.  The pork was OK, but the spice was a heavy coating on the pork.  It was spicy but other than that, there wasn't a whole lot to recommend the tacos.  I also thought of the al pastors I've gotten from street vendors on East Charleston for a fraction of the cost I paid.  Stupid me!  With my tacos came rice and black beans.  My wife liked her chicken and it was as described.  It's the kind of dish you might get at any Tex/Mex kind of restaurant.  Dessert was the star of the night.  I got the très leches cake and she got the Mexican brownie.  My cake was excellent.  Her brownie came with a bit of table side ta da! The brownie was placed on a very hot cast iron dish safely in a recessed wooden holder.  Then the vanilla ice cream was put on top of the brownie.  LAst, the sauce was poured over the ice cream and when the sauce hit the hot dish, it bubbled and made a kind of extra buttery syrup that added to the flavor of the brownie and ice cream.    Now to service:  Up until the time we got our meals, everything was going along fine.  Then our server disappeared.  She came back once and asked about the food and then was gone again.  10 minutes after we finished our dishes, she was nowhere to be found.  The host looked at us several times and it seemed as though he was going to get her at one point but that was not the case.  Finally she showed and we asked about a box and asked about dessert.  She said she'd get the dessert tray and be back.  Again she was just gone.  About 5 minutes later, another server stopped and asked if we wanted a box.  We told him we'd already asked for one and then he brought his tray down to show us the desserts. We made our choice with him.  A few minutes later, our server and this second person arrived with the desserts.  She stood by as he did the table ta da for the brownie.  Then she left again.  About 6 minutes later, she came back with the check and just put it down.    When I finished dessert and we had some time to relax and talk, I got my credit card out and put it in the holder and within 10 seconds, she was there to pick it up.  Wow, Speedy Gonzales then but not at the needed times.    I really like Tivoli Village and there are some other restaurants there that I have yet to try.  But, Cantina Laredo won't be one of them.  We have so many small places along East Charleston that there's no reason to ever go here again."}
{"text":"Service is excellent and drinks were well made. Food was good but not great and definitively overpriced. I would come again if invited but would not be my first choice.  Just to stress the service was wonderful, Jon is great."}
{"text":"First time here and nit impressed with food!, the  appetizers are your routine bar food! Ordered cheese enchiladas and very disappointed! Small, tasteless and hard! Needed a steak knife to cut it! The ambiance is dull and like a funeral home with loud irritating music playing! The only good thing is service is excellent! Going to pass this one up!!"}
{"text":"Our first time here. The endless chips and salsa were great. Preferred the warm salsa, but that was just us. The table side guacamole was kind of blah and rather skimpy considering the high price. Should be no more than $6-7. And the kid making it wasn't very impressive. Would not order again. I had cheese enchiladas with poblano sauce which were very good. (I actually ordered cheese and onion, but they forgot the onions which wasn't a big deal.) The rice was so so, but the beans were really tasty. My husband had steak quesadillas which were also really good. The steak was cooked nicely and it had a really good flavor. We didn't have cocktails this time, but would definitely go back during happy hour to take advantage of better pricing. Not very busy for a Saturday night, but it was nice not to have to wait. Giving them four stars because we liked our entrees so much."}
{"text":"Cantina hosted our first charity Bunco event for Nobody's Perfect today and they did an amazing job.  The food was outstanding and the service was exceptional.  The manager RJ and his staff went above & beyond to make our event a huge success and we hope to make this an annual event at Cantina. Big thanks to Mickey for helping us prepare and making it happen!!  If you haven't eaten there yet be sure to do so.."}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo is located inside the Tivoli Village, a beautiful open space with cobblestone streets and architecture made to look like you're walking in a small town in Italy, complete with a giant fountain.  Nice little shops, restaurants', a cafe, a cigar bar and it's newest tenant...the \"Authentic\" Mexican Food restaurant Cantina Laredo.  The \"cantina\" also boasts a nice a outdoor eating area with pre-lit trees glistening in various colors to put you in the mood for a fiesta.    The decor inside is sleek modern and upscale, such a contradiction when juxtaposed with our enchilada dish which aesthetically was a mess...we all know that we eat with our eyes first and if you saw the sad entree on my plate you would have thought your  angry mother-in-law served it up.  Here's a run-down on my Enchilada Plate: No garnish! No slices of avocado, no sour cream, no lettuce, no tomatoes, no nothin'! Bland!  I've had better TV dinners!  Cheap Cheddar Cheese barely sprinkled on top! What no Cotija? Ugh! An ugly brown sauce that looked gross  My entree was served on a tiny plate...fit more for a slice of cake The entree looked like they just slapped everything together.     This Chef should be embarassed sending out that enchilada plate that looked like this!  I did order the flautas and those were good. I actually enjoyed the creamy sauce and the pico garnish. Eye pleasing too.  We sat at the bar and had our dinner.    The service at the bar gets five stars.  The Baretnders/Waiters were super friendly and attentive and the margaritas were very good.    I would absolutely still come back because I know an enchilada plate can be fixed but outstanding service is hard to come by.  Sorry Chef, but you need to fix this Enchilada hot mess!  Every picture on Yelp should look like a mouth-watering masterpiece to lure people in...Then it better taste like one!"}
{"text":"Jessica is an outstanding server but we had a hiccup when we ate here for happy hour.  The hostess, Julia, sat us in the back because the bar area was full and told us it would be okay to order happy hour.  It's common practice there but she never told Jessica about us and happy hour so our check leaped to $90 off a few items and drinks.  We ordered everything from the menu side that offers happy hour and drinks which should have been an indicator that we were there for happy hour.  The manager ended up giving us happy hour prices for the 3 taco dishes we ordered but not the casita rita's but made it $5 rather than the $3 HH price.   The only item we did order that wasn't happy hour was the table side guacamole because it's sooo good but if they ever sit you outside the bar area for happy hour triple check with the hostess to make sure they told the server, check with your server to make sure she knows and the manager because they have the swipe card to access happy hour prices.  I'll still come back because the street style tacos are good, drinks are made well, and happy hour is hard to be beat here."}
{"text":"Dined in for lunch on Monday and practically had the place to ourselves. It is a large space.   I was pleasantly surprised with the experience!   Chips are ultra light, fresh and crispy and salsas are flavorful.   I had the enchilada Veracruz and it was delicious. The green sauce was tangy and the plate was vibrant with colorful fresh vegetables. The enchilada was filled with fresh spinach and topped with red cabbage and carrots. Perfectly crunchy sautéed  zucchini and red peppers were served alongside. The rice has a unique flavor which is not my personal preference but different! Hubby was also very pleased with his carne and enchilada. His steak had a delicious grilled flavor. The prices and portions are just right.   The kids meal was excellent. Around $5.75 for 6 half taquitos with pepper cheese dip, rice and beans and a drink. Disappointed they did not have milk for my guy though.   We had the mango tres leches to finish. It was very good but could have been a little more soaked in leches. Service was good but a bit slow for the number of patrons in the place.   I would definitely go back for another lovely lunch; the outdoor space looks like an excellent spot for a margarita when the weather is not so HOT!"}
{"text":"Thursday night happy hour is half off certain appetizers and drinks.  I managed to get a real margarita (NO MARGARITA MIX) and a plate full of tacos al pastor for $8.25 before tax and tip.  I was hugely impressed by being able to do this in North Scottsdale and am willing to drive back up there for a second try."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal for 10 people celebrating. . Food was very good & prices were reasonable. Salsa was awesome. Don't know why anyone wouldn't rate this restaurant fairly highly. Very good Mexican cuisine. Families will work also.  Guacomole was also very good. Carne asada was excellent."}
{"text":"One of the rare places I've been that has excellent food AND service! Ive been back a few times now and haven't been disappointed yet. Their happy hour is awesome and they have a great tequila selection. I definitely recommend the fresh made guacamole, they make it right in front of you! After the first time I had it I was already craving more the next day! Also my server recommended the carnitas which were amazing! The meat was so tender and juicy and basically fell off the bone, and the chipotle wine sauce on top didn't steal from the meat but added just the perfect mouth watering touch! There are so many restaurants to choose from around here that it takes a lot for me to return to the same place more than once, and I am quickly becoming a regular here. If you haven't been here yet, definitely make it a point to check it out!"}
{"text":"Mmmm...artichoke and avocado enchiladas are a veggie-saur dream come true! Delicious and then some.  The atmosphere is nice in here, and it's definitely a busy place because of San Tan being such a hot spot for shopping, but the service is really pretty great.  The drinks are somewhat pricey (thus only 4 stars instead of 5), so realistically, this isn't a place you want to come for more than one drink unless you plan to have a large bill at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"I wish I had the ability to rate a 3.5 stars. This place has great guacamole and is above average for sure."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Everything taste fresh and service is always great! My wife and I love it here and the employees help my wife learning spanish!"}
{"text":"I think I've been here 3-4 times.  First few visits were mediocre at best.  This last visit I ordered a skinny margarita, cheese enchilada and regular taco.  The skinny margarita tasted like a Diet Sprite. The cheese enchilada was OK.  I took a bite of my regular ground beef taco and couldn't believe how much it tasted like a Taco Bell taco but at 3x times the price.  I then looked down and noticed that the meat was under cooked.  Loose ground beef....not fully cooked!  Not pink, but RED.  Anyone who knows anything about food prep and handling knows, under cooked loose ground beef is one of the most dangerous, next to raw chicken of course.  Thanks for not making me pay for my food but, this is unforgivable.  Got to spend the whole day worried I was going to get food poisoning (which I didn't thank god!)"}
{"text":"I'm no Mexican food aficionado or anything, but this place has a lot going for it. Even though it is big and has the feel of a chain (our hotel concierge actually described it as the PF Chang's of Mexican food), but once you're at your table, it can feel quite cozy and homey. There are some nooks and crannies you can seek out to feel a little more tucked in.   The guac is made tableside, which is a big selling point for me because anything interactive when dining with coworkers is always a nice ice breaker. It also happened to be ladies night when I was there (a Thursday evening). Who knew ladies night still existed anywhere? Not me. So this was a fun surprise and an easy excuse to order margaritas (which were good, not anything amazingly mindblowing, but a good, solid margarita and a varied list so everyone actually tried something different).   The food was fresh and flavorful, things weren't completely and unnecessarily smothered in too much cheese, there were interesting side options other than just rice and beans (I'm talking to you, snap peas), and a server, if not necessarily our server, was always accessible. Everyone at the table seemed happy with the dinner, and I'd go back if I'm in the area again and have a hankering for enchiladas, so that equals \"A-OK\" in my book."}
{"text":"I had my reservations about going to an upscale Mexican restaurant because we all know the best Mexican food can be found in Da Hood at a real dive!  However, against my better judgment, I decided to give this place a try!  NOTE TO SELF: TRUST YOUR DAMN GUT!  The atmosphere is lovely but the food is quite marginal!!  The food is a bit too busy with too many ingredients because they are trying to be upscale and different!  I ordeed the enchilada veracruz,.which was supposed to be a chicken and spinach enchilada with jack cheese and tomatillo sauce! There was little to no cheese, I could barely see the sauce and it had no flavor!! The only saving grace was the wonderful bartender who exchange my dish for tacos!   Will trust my gut next time!"}
{"text":"Fancy Mexican.This place is nice..food was good with a friendly staff.  Although we did feel rushed by the waiter a bit.  I had the shrimp enchiladas.  Very tastey. Good chips, salsa and they do table-side guacamole."}
{"text":"This place was great...is it the Mexican food you expect? Not really. But the quality of the ingredients were so fresh. We took our uncles there for dinner and they loved it as well. Good for kids, they loved the chips and salsa and the guacamole at your table was great."}
{"text":"How did he know? I guess we looked liked tired shoppers who needed a few margaritas, and they were damn good margaritas at that. The bartender was attentive, and so was the wait staff (chips and salsa as soon as we hit the seats). We had a couple margs and shared the brisket tacos, which were pretty deelish. The salsas are also nice.   Only four stars cause, the decor is lacking any interest and it's a corporate franchise, it's hard for me to give five stars to a place that's a little too expensive and lacks soul."}
{"text":"This review is for the Happy Hour only.  Server and bartender seemed overwhelmed and unprepared for how busy it was.  HH special \"CasaRita\" took forever to arrive and was the worst margarita I've ever had :( -- so salty as to be undrinkable and no discernible tequila.  HH tacos were good but we were charged full price so more time wasted sending the bill back for corrections.   Maybe try this place when it is *not* Happy Hour???"}
{"text":"$45 for two very tasty and unique entrees plus uno Margarita. The chips and salsa were on par with their gourmet menu. Side dishes as common as beans and rice were refreshingly tasty. The service was impeccable. Ask for Mario from Yugoslavia as your waiter. Can't go wrong with Mario. The manager was very open to conversation, not your usual hit and run meet and greet. Yes, the food is pricey. You will spend more here for Mexican food because it's gourmet. What does that mean exactly? That was my question going in and my answer was very tasty and some nice and spicy dishes. My wife who is very hard to please left her comfort zone and ordered some tacos with a tomatillo and pineapple sauce. She was very happy she ventured outside her world of a la carte tacos. Although this is not your everyday Mexican joint it proves to be a welcomed detour on your journey through Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"Food was good but service there is not good.  This is the second time going there and both times the service was junk."}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo is my favorite spot in Gilbert for happy hour. The margaritas are great and the service is always so quick! They have a great selection of half prices food for happy hour, my favorite is the fish tacos."}
{"text":"This review is for the Sunday brunch. I actually intended to go there for lunch but when my friend and I read the incredibly tempting brunch menu, we had to go for it. CL serves brunch from 11:00-3:00, so plenty of time to drag your lazy or hungover ass out of bed. The brunch menu ranges from $13-$17 per person and it is worth every penny.   First you get your choice of a complimentary mimosa or bloody mary. They load you up on chips and two varieties of salsa while you wait for your entree. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the brunch menu and even the manager stopped by our table to chat us up and make some suggestions.  I went with the manager's suggested favorite, the Crab Cakes Benedict. Oh my was this incredible! The eggs, they were so perfectly poached. The crab cakes had a ton of crab in them and were very flavorful. The hollandaise sauce was totally sinful and delicious and in just the right amount. The crab cakes themselves were huge. They give you two but with all the other food that comes with the meal I could not finish the second one. I did however inhale that second poached egg. Even typing about it makes me want to drive over there this moment! I love me some runny yolk.   My friend got the Chorizo con Huevos. It was spicy and perfectly cooked. Again the portion was huge. They serve the brunch meals on platters that could hold a Thanksgiving turkey. You could easily get two meals out of one. All of the brunch meals come with bread, fruit salad, and potatoes in the form of home fries. The bread is actually a small, dense bun/roll with some type of honey glaze on it. It was really tasty and the glaze was very light, not gooey or heavy. The fruit salad was extremely fresh and had huge strawberries and chunks of mango and melon. The fruit was served in this deep-fried, cinnamon sugar coated \"bowl\" with extra cinnamon sprinkled on the fruit, delicious! The potatoes were meh. They were a little too mushy for home fries, not firm enough, but they were seasoned well and served with an ungodly amount of butter.   The decor here is rather nice and everything including the bathroom was impeccably clean. The booths are extremely comfortable and roomy. Sucks that this place is located in BFE, but definitely worth a stop if you are hitting up San Tan for shopping anyway. If I did live in Gilbert I would probably be here every Sunday!"}
{"text":"Had a very good dinner tonight!! The service of Cesar, our waiter made it great! If we weren't sure on a flavor of something, he would bring a taste to make sure we liked.  The fish tacos were very good, cilantro/lime rice was the Bomb!  Wednesday is half price wine night, they have a great rose on the menu. Would come back in a heart beat as long as Cesar was our waiter!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now, once for lunch, twice for dinner.  I like patio seating, I live in Vegas afterall and we have one week of Spring and one week of Fall, so I truly take advantage!!  The patio here is nice - it's comfortable, it's great for people watching.  The big patio to the side was booked for a private party, so we weren't able to sit there when I was there last.  The atmosphere is very comfortable, little noisy, but nothing unusual.      I love Mexican food, I love chips n salsa and this is where my first disappointment lies. The salsa is fine (noteworthy would be a stretch, but it does taste fresh), but the chips are these thin tasteless corn things with no zing, there's nothing to love about them, at all!  Try the chips and salsa from Leticia's and you'll know what I mean by great chips!   The guac made fresh and tableside is pretty great - it tastes awesome and is all that great guac is supposed to be!  I've had the chicken salad, carnitas tacos, shrimp tacos, and mahi tacos (LOVE tacos too!) and fajitas here.  All very average. They do let you mix your tacos - three per plate and you can try a variety if that's your thing.  The carnitas tacos were the best of the three, but not a WOW kind of taco. They are smaller, street taco size, just like we had back in Ensenada, but not as memorable.  My husband had the enchiladas and said they were \"yea, they were good\", but again, nothing great.   They do have a happy hour here - its in the bar area only and does include food although I wouldn't say it's any kind of a smokin' deal that would bring me in.  The drinks . . . . maybe, but not the food.    I didn't have one, but the woman next to me raved about their Casa Rita margarita which is their house margarita.  I'm not a margarita gal, but if you are, try it out!!"}
{"text":"My friend who recommended this place was my guest for Dinner.  Being a Friday we went with two Fish Plate. I choose Sea Bass (great flavor and texture) he his the Salmon.  I got to taste that as well. Very Good service from Theresa was on Point and the prices are reasonable for the quality of food you get.   Tip.    Table side Guacamole"}
{"text":"Asked for a 'spicier' salsa, The gentleman said, \"I'll go make one right away\" was super fresh...that's outstanding! Superb customer service and compensation for minor 'oops'! Not fond of the chili con carne sauce, too overpowering, it was literally chili."}
{"text":"Great service and always amazing food! Chef Damon is a genius. Try the ahi tuna tacos, they've got a unique flavor and the blend of the tuna, guacamole, pickled onions and sauce is perfect! Watermelon margarita is my favorite, not too sweet and strong enough to knock your socks off after a couple. Never miss a chance of table side guacamole, it's made to order right in front of you and exactly how you like it and from there choose any entree. I have more than enough good things to say about cantina Laredo but the most important one is to go try it!"}
{"text":"Chilean Sea Bass  We have been here before and the service is always great.  Tonight, I ordered a Chilean Sea Bass that was painfully over cooked. I sent the first order back only to receive another one that was butterflied and equally over-cooked. When the manager came to our table we told him that the fish was over-cooked and not typical of Chilean Sea Bass. He asked if we had the fish at his restaurant before.. When we said no.. He said he was sorry we didn't like it and walked away.  It was a $30 entree in a suburban mall restaurant. Not sure where he thinks he works but the opinion of his customers should matter. As far as I am concerned.. This restaurant is a fail."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food! Great drinks! I'm a mojito aficionado and the bartender here makes a good one! Love the tacos and table side guacamole!"}
{"text":"cool atmosphere but I wasnt impressed with the food. I guess I like traditional and this reminded me of texmex.  I'm also not a fan of chepolte and Verde sauces so it could be I ordered the wrong thing.  I think over all the atmosphere is fun."}
{"text":"Nothing comes close to the quality for your money like the food and drinks. We always feel special when we are there.  The bartenders, waitstaff and managers are so personable.  Special thanks to Duke , Mickey ,Teresa, Stew,Chris, Ivan and William. Thank you to all of you for making every visit special for me and my family and friends.   You are the reason I refer to cantina as my Disneyland. It's my escape to laugh relax and have a great great time.    Adrienne Constantinou-Lockrem."}
{"text":"This place was weird, but some aspects were good. I liked the decor inside the restaurant and I was greeted and seated very quickly. Our server was very friendly, upbeat, and had a nice personality. My issue with the experience we had was As follows:  1) There was no music on, so you could hear plates clanking and everyone else's conversations.  2) One of the salsas that was brought out was piping hot and I wasn't informed. I almost burned my tongue.   3) The food is described as \"Gourmet\", but in my opinion was just okay. We got a steak burrito, which was a ground meat with something similar in taste to Kraft cheese on top. The beans and rice were good, though.   This place has potential, but needs a little work."}
{"text":"FYI this is only a review of Cantina Laredo's happy hour, because I don't go any other time...  Service is always amazing, which I appreciate. I sometimes feel that many restaurants/servers don't give as great of service during happy hour because they know the bill won't be as high as normal and hence, they will most likely receive less of a tip. However, with that being said, I'm happy to report that Cantina Laredo is not like that. :)  From their happy hour menu, my husband is obsessed with the Ahi Tuna Tacos - gets them every time. I love the steak nachos and the cheeseburger sliders. You would think, meh, cheeseburger sliders at a Mexican restaurant? But no, they're pretty darn good. They have cheese, bacon and guacamole on them and they come with fries! Those are the things we love.  Things we don't love: the empanadas. That's the only thing we've tried on the HH menu that we really didn't like at all.  Their chips and salsa are great! I think it's fun that there is a warm temperature one and a cold temperature one. And heads up, their $5 casa rita is STRONG. Definitely a great value. :)"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Fine dining Mexican for sure.  I will say its on the pricey side especially  for dinner. Best time to come here is for HH Mon-Fri & Sunday for brunch. $2 mimosas & bloody marias & one is included  with your meal. Great deal!"}
{"text":"Being consistent is a key, went again after the review written below and this time I ordered the Taco's Al carbon and they were a little tough so I take a star away from my original evaluation because I want it to be the same every visit. If you ask me to go back....Oh yes. Mexican cuisine - Let's start with our waiter, Javier awesome job and his interaction with us (4) was great. The top shelve guacamole was made at the table and was good and the food was very good.. There had been some changes to old items on the menu (good changes that enhanced the product).  New menu items which I choose to try which I enjoyed..I'll leave it up to you to choose your new favorite food."}
{"text":"This was an excellent experience. It was amazing food, service and atmosphere. My wife and I enjoyed ourselves very much. Our server, Ryan, was attentive and courteous. The food was excellent and had amazing flavor. I had the fajitas with corn tortillas and my wife had the Enchiladas. Both dishes were excellent. We had the guacamole made table side. The guacamole was the least enjoyable, but was incredible. We then had the flan for dessert. It was the best flan either of us have ever had.  Thanks, we will be back again soon."}
{"text":"When I checked in here, I was a little surprised that it's average rating isn't higher. But then I realized that I always get the same thing when I eat here, so I decided to branch out. I can now confidently speak for two items on the menu.  The pros: The Carne Asada is delicious- that is what I normally get. This time I got the Avocado and Artichoke Enchiladas and I really enjoyed them too. Another reviewer mentioned liking the chips and salsa, and I agree. They give you two completely different types of salsa, and they are both really good. Also- I really like their chips. I have high expectations when it comes to chips at Mexican restaurants, and these ones are really very good. The service has always been really great while I am there, and there is a pretty nice atmosphere. Oh- I have also had their apple pie dessert- it comes out sizzling and they have cinnamon ice cream to go along with it. It's amazing!   The cons: As some other Yelpers have said, drinks are just ok and when I am paying $10 for a margarita, I would prefer that it isn't watered down.   Anyway, is it authentic Mexican food? No, but it is still pretty tasty. I'll keep going here, and maybe next time I will be able to review something else on the menu."}
{"text":"It's in the mall people! A nice corporate chain restaurant that aims to offend no one.  Taken on that level, it's not bad.  Prices are fairly high and the food is fairly bland.  It's a place to stop in while getting some shopping done with the sweetie, not a place to take her to."}
{"text":"Jaclyn was fantastic!!!!! It's Friday night extremely busy, yet our food was delivered promptly and it was delicious. The general manager D Workman, took good care of us and he is friendly.  Jaclyn made this experience extraordinary.  We were not expecting the quality of service we received.  I want to thank the staff for been nice.  The customer service business can be challenging, and this group of people make it seem so effortlessly.  Great experience wonderful staff and delicious food..  Thank you Mr. Workman for taking care of your  customers."}
{"text":"This place is terrible - now I see why there were so many empty seats in the place. My daughter ordered the taquitos - totally pre frozen - for sure not home made!  My husband ordered a fajita combo w/ short ribs - TERRIBLE - it pretty much went untouched. I ordered the chicken tacos - they didn't taste too bad, but boy does my tummy hurt now!  We would have been better off driving to Elmer's Tacos!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place quite often. It's one of my wife's favorite places to eat. We had lunch here earlier and I feel that our experience keeps going down. We were greeted instantly by the young host and seated quickly. We noticed a server there that we don't care for so politely asked if we can get another server. The server today was ok. Now, in my opinion I not only want my drinks to be refilled when low and my food to be brought out fairly quickly, but to be personable and happy and make it seem like you like your job. He wasn't very personable, friendly, or very much conversation. However, he did pay attention to us saying it was our grandmas birthday so he brought out a dessert.   The food was ok. Brunch entrees are much better.   On a positive note, I want to say the bartender there was super friendly and recognized my wife and I and made an effort to shake our hands at our table. Now that is good customer service! Hire people like that!"}
{"text":"Good food, horrible service. Ordered the enchiladas with crab meat. It came with zucchini and rice as the sides and they were fantastic! The service was so bad that  a women that wasn't our waitress started waiting on us. After waiting forever, we finally flagged down our server for the check. He apologized and said he was busy with other tables on the other side of the restaurant. Not a good excuse."}
{"text":"After some shopping, my husband spotted this place and I remember looking at them on Yelp. I recalled they had a good happy hour. Decision made, we sauntered in. I asked the hostess if they were still having happy hour and she said it went until 7pm and was only in the bar. We spotted a lonely bar table and sat there. Our waitress was quick to arrive and take our drink order. During Monday's happy hour, it's Margarita Monday, so the larger sized margaritas are $5. (Smaller sized ones are $3.) Margaritas can be any number of flavors - mango, strawberry, etc. I asked if they had coconut but unfortunately not. I decided to go with a house margarita on the rocks. My husband went with blended. Our drinks arrived quickly and in a large glass. (The glasses reminded me of the heavy margarita glasses that Chili's uses.) For a house margarita, the drink was really good and really strong on the tequila. Wowza, these were some strong drinks. (Even the blended drink. I was totally thinking premade slushie machine but I seriously think they made the drink then threw it in a blender.)   During happy hour, the appetizers and tacos are half price. The appetizers include flatbread, nachos, ceviche, etc. We decided on the shrimp flatbread and chicken tacos. The flatbread came out on a long rectangular board and three tacos to a plate. The flatbread was good but really it was on square crackers - kind of like matzo. I kept joking it should be called shrimp crackers (totally the tequila talking). The chicken tacos were good too with a huge slice of avocado on them. When the tacos ran out, my husband decided to order fish tacos (mahi mahi). These came out quickly and were delicious as well. When the flatbread and tacos were gone, our waitress asked if we had room for dessert. My husband inquired which of the desserts were really good - he couldn't decide between the flan, brownie, or apple pie. Our waitress said the apple pie was surprisingly delicious and one of their most popular desserts. How could we resist? The dessert comes out with several dishes. There's a huge cast iron plate that is scorching hot and this is where the brandy butter sauce is poured upon. As this sizzles and cooks up, the apple pie is placed in the butter, and then ice cream is dropped on top. As a non-apple pie lover, this was pretty good. I enjoyed the brandy butter sauce and ice cream the most, they tasted great together. Unfortunately, our eyes were much larger than our stomachs and we couldn't finish this dessert.   We left full, satisfied, and happy. I would definitely recommend coming here for happy hour. The food and drinks were a great price and everything was tasty. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner! Our waitress Lindsey made excellent recommendations! Always amazing! Our favorite cantina!"}
{"text":"The food was what I expected because my friends recommended that I come here, and the margaritas were good. The atmosphere was lively, so it is a great place to go with family and/or friends. The menu is also priced right, so feel free to try an appetizer, entree, and dessert. I have to admit, I didn't know what to order so I read my fellow Yelper's reviews for suggestions. Thanks guys! You were right, the fish tacos rock! Although the service was on the slow side because it was busy, our waitress, Claudia, made every effort to check on us. Once we were able to place our order, the food came fairly quickly. The portions were smaller than what I'm used to for a Mexican restaurant, but the flavor made up for it. I was very satisfied and full. The fresh chips and salsa placed on the table when we arrived helped. Thanks for making sure we stay fabulous and fit Cantina Laredo! I will definitely be back because I love Mexican Food!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy reverse happy hour! Good appetizer selection and $5 margaritas. Tonight we had table side guacamole and quesadillas. Starts at 9:00  PM"}
{"text":"Loved the enchilada mole and our waitress Danielle was  so attentive and really kind! Will def be back"}
{"text":"Looking for some yummy Mexican-ish type food? Look here!  Cantina Laredo is a newer restaurant located in Tivoli Village, right next to the colorful trees. Its a very nice and open location, and the seating is not tight and uncomfortable. Upon entering you will see a bar area to the left, an outdoor area to the far left, and to the right more seating inside with the cool AC running. There is also more seating available on the patio, but we opted for the cool indoor seating.   Then menu is simple, the front is the Entrees and food, the back has all the drinks they offer. This visit we all got a mojito, the waiter suggested adding peach to make it more delicious, and boy he was spot on with that! We chose the \"Cantina roll\" and the table side guacamole as our apps, they also provide you with chips and 2 different types of salsas. I liked both, one was a little spicier than the other so it was nice to have variety. Soon our lady came to us with her cart to make the table side guac, what I liked most is that you have a choice of peppers, the hot Serrano, spicy jalapeno, or the roasted jalapeno. I really wanted Serrano, but we went with the jalapeno. You can also choose what other ingredients you would like added, the standard tomatoes, red onions, cilantro, and of course lime and other spices. She pitted 2 large avocados and went to work making the guac. She was very good at making it, although I would've like it a little creamier, she had big chunks of avocado in there, luckily they were ripe and soft so it was ok. My friend liked it so much so he ordered a 2nd order when dinner arrived.   For our entrees we all ordered enchiladas, my \"mother\" opted for the enchiladas de espinaca aka spinach enchiladas. They consisted of Sautéed spinach, Monterey jack cheese and mushrooms topped with sour cream poblano sauce. Her husband went with the Enchiladas Veracruz which were made of chicken, spinach and monterey jack topped with tomatillo sauce, marinated vegetables, and queso fresco. I went for the Enchiladas de Camarones aka shrimp enchiladas, these were made with Shrimp, Monterey jack cheese and roasted peppers on vegetables topped with sour cream poblano sauce. All entrees include 2 enchis and rice, some cilantro some Spanish, and black beans. My enchiladas were super amazing, and coming from a Mexican girl that should mean something! My friends also agreed! Their entrees were gone is less than 10 minutes! As well as their yummy mojitos! If you've ever dined with me, I am definitely the slowest eater ever, BEWARE!  The nice server came back to our table and asked if we were ready for dessert, of course Santiago said yes so he brought out an actual plated selection of what was available. We chose the mango tres leches and the Mexican brownie. The Brownie consisted of a large brownie with pecans and walnuts served on a sizzling skillet with Mexican Brandy Butter and vanilla or cinnamon ice cream. The mango tres leches were a creamy vanilla cake with fresh mango as well as mango cream sauce. THEY WERE AMAZING! My favorite was the mango tres leches, mainly bc it was sooooo light and tasted amazing with the mangos! By the end of all of this, we were totally full!  The service at Cantina Laredo is impeccable and the quality and quantity of food is just right for the price, its more gourmet and you can tell they put love and time into every dish they make. We will definitley be back for happy hour, where they have specials on apps and drinks!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy going here.  Service is fine, not rushed, but not too slow.  I get the enchilada with vegies and spinach.  Very good, healthy and consistent.   Chips are good but the two salsa are almost the same to me.  Drinks are good.   It is not your usual beans and rice 8$ plate place, and that is what makes it good."}
{"text":"This place was a nice departure from the typical Mexican restaurant. A little more upscale and modern. Very fresh and delicious food!  The complimentary chips and salsa were so good. Not greasy or heavy like a lot of other Mexican restaurants. Shrimp enchiladas were very flavorful and the table side guacamole and dessert options were a fun touch. Definitely would go back again and again!"}
{"text":"Great steak fajita burrito. Great servers and really good fresh margaritas. I would recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"My Husband travels for business and is away sometimes months at a time.... He has to eat out a lot and when he dose as we all should expect a good experience. The service at the bar started out good for the most part but after he was done with his first beer he waiting 25min to have someone offer him another drink. The service would ask the people next to him but never offer him, even one of the manager came behind the bar saw his empty drink and did nothing! Finally a guy handed him his check and then asked if he needed anything. At this point he was frustrated and already his experience was ruined! Could be that the initial guy that was serving him left but never the less rude and inconsiderate."}
{"text":"Went to lunch with 4 other co-workers around 11:40AM on a Wednesday.  Walked in and the hostess just stared at us. She was a young girl so maybe she doesn't understand what a greeting is. We said we had 5 people and she walked us over to a table.   Our server Jorge came by and we received water and were reviewing our menu's. I will say that the service was quick to get the food out.   We ordered the guacamole that they make tableside. It was ok but I've had much better at Gallo Blanco in Phoenix. They have amazing guac!! I don't think the guac here is worth the price they charge.   I ordered the Enchilada Veracruz and can say that it read better than it tasted.  It was dry on the top when it was supposed to have the sauce and cojita cheese. I was expecting a stuffed enchilada and it was OK but I have had better. Definately could pass that one up even though the server said it was highly recommended.   The table didn't have any complaints as far as anything else...except that our server disappeared after clearing our plates. We probably waited a good 15 minutes as we were expecting to get our check and he kept serving other tables. Good for them and bad for us when we had to get back for business calls.   The atmosphere was \"Trendy Scottsdale\" and it was a nice place overall but I don't think I will be visiting again. One bonus though, if you sign up with them online, they will send you a coupon for a free appetizer. So my guac was free."}
{"text":"Mmmm... Their burritos and queso dip are soo good, we can never bring ourselves to order anything else! They're also very reasonably priced for how big they are - I've made it last 3 meals before. Their mojitos and margaritas are delish too!"}
{"text":"In the mood for some Mexican food and we found this place. The wait staff was really nice and knowledgable about the menu.   We ordered drinks, then entrées. I ordered the tres fajita and wife ordered Monterrey enchiladas. The food didn't take a long time and was really good when it arrived. The food tasted really fresh and was presented very well.   I gave this place four stars because I hadn't tried everything just yet. I'm looking forward to going back.   Additionally, the menu was very reasonably priced. I would recommend Cantina Laredo to anyone who likes fresh Mexican food."}
{"text":"BEST HAPPY HOUR IN TOWN!!!! be careful though the margaritas are so addicting! This place is great after work. Haven't had anything off of their regular menu. The food is okay. Chips and salsa are delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm really surprised to see some of the negative reviews on this place. I had a great experience.  I was in Phoenix visiting family and friends when we decided to stop here on the way home from the airport. The inside is really neat. It's dim, but very modern looking. I honestly was a little nervous to look at the prices because of it. The waiter when he came over seemed like his job was the best thing to ever happen to the planet. Picture the annoying guy at the Apple Store trying to explain why Apple is the best thing in the world... but toned down. It actually was a good thing. We ordered the queso and moved on to checking out the rest of the menu. Its not a huge menu but has some unique options. When the waiter came back I asked about 2 different options... chicken or pork tacos. Not only was he certain which one he wanted me to have, he decided to describe both in great detail. He knew every ingredient and the order in which it was put on the tacos. And these were not ordinary tacos. All sorts of wonderful stuff on those bad boys. The food was great. Portions were small, and it was a little overpriced, but overall I quite enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Wonderful atmosphere.  Try the signature dish with steak and Pamela no pepper."}
{"text":"This time around I had the Cantina Laredo combo plate which included a fajita taco, chicken enchilada, beef tamale and chile relleno.  Wow, is the only word that comes to mind when describing.   Go try it if you were thinking about it."}
{"text":"Food and service was outstanding.  The made at your table  guacamole (unless your outside is so good.  Don't pass up the apple pie.  Can't be beat"}
{"text":"Definitely not traditional Mexican food but more a Twisty fashion of Mexican dishes. The drinks and margaritas are very delicious and the atmosphere especially sitting outside on the terrace is very nice and relaxing.   The food is just okay to me. There really isn't anything spicy which is what I look forward to when it comes to Mexican food. If you eat outside during the spring the weather feels great but your food will be cold by the second bite.  The staff is very friendly but a little spacey when it comes to you asking for things or serving your food.  I would prefer to come for drinks and maybe chips and salsa. Not necessarily a big fan of the menu."}
{"text":"My kids and I came here for lunch. It was pretty dead inside and raining outside, and my kids were starving. I figured we might as well since there was no wait.  We walked in and were seated right away. The waitress came pretty fast to take our drink order. It was obvious she wasn't thrilled about serving us, probably because she thought the bill wouldn't be high enough to constitute a decent tip. The entire time we were there she acted like we were a total nuisance, and I promise you that I am a nice and easy customer.  My kids had bean burritos from the kids menu ($9 each) that they said were bland and I had chicken tacos and were pretty blasé. With drinks and tip the bill was over $40. We could have gone to Some Burros across the street for $15 and it would have been better service and better food. Next time we know to skip this place."}
{"text":"I don't know how they can put \"gormet\" on the door with a clear conscience.  How do you mess up beef enchiladas?! Terrible overpriced food."}
{"text":"Bottom line: starters are great, main entrees are NOT. You will be impressed by the chunky guac made TO ORDER table side $10, and fresh chips and two kinds of salsa as starters. Even the Sangria was good. The rest of the meal will leave a lot to be desired. We ordered beef enchiladas and chicken chipotle (which I've never heard of, prob not an authentic Mexican dish) and both were made with cheap ingredients/equivalents and passed off as 'non traditional' Mexican. Lacking in flavor, and small portions are the culprit. Few restaurants can pull off reinventing staple items, and this is not one of them.  We ate a little of the dishes and gave up, jus went back to eating chips and dip. Our waitress was really cool, offered to make something else for us. We declined and jus ordered blood orange sangria (great choice). Although it was disappointing entree wise and we left hungry, we left drunk and that's not a total loss;)"}
{"text":"My family loves this place!  My favorite is the Chilean Sea Bass.  Even on a busy Friday night, the service was excellent.  We've been here a few other times and it's been great every time.  We had 8 in our party and they were very accommodating.  I came here for lunch a few months ago and had their steak fajitas.  The seasoning and texture of the steak was perfect!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Decided to give this a try. The food was good, but not what I'd call authentic. The restaurant is clean and comfortable. My wife had the fish tacos and I had the chicken and spinach enchiladas. Service was ok. Chips, salsa and guacamole were good also."}
{"text":"Ate at the bar the made Guac table side am and it was really great. Drinks were also great good prices. Great happy hour."}
{"text":"We had an early dinner Saturday and we had very great service the staff was so friendly and was there at the table with refills seconds before our glasses were empty.  The waitress recommend some of the new items and they were great!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a lunch spot on a Saturday afternoon and Mexican food always sounds good so this was a logical choice.   I liked the ambiance of the restaurant. It was simple with a clean, modern feel. I could see this as a fun spot to meet friends for dinner or happy hour.   The chips and salsa to start were good. The hot salsa was my favorite, but it wasn't overly hot. My husband ordered a Passion Fruit Colada that was really good. It was one of the best drinks I've tried in awhile.  I ordered the Relleno de Camarones as my lunch. It was really good and had a nice mix of vegetables in the pepper along with the shrimp. There was cheese to add to the goodness, but not an overwhelming amount. The cilantro lime rice and avocado on the side went well with the relleno. This was a lighter option that I really enjoyed. My husband ordered the Cancun which was a combination of three items and he raved about this.   Overall, we really enjoyed the drinks and food. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my friend and had the enchilada espinaca and it was delish!! I would love to try the table side guac next time too,"}
{"text":"Carnitas a signature dish was perfect. Anyone looking for typical retried beans Mexican food will want to look elsewhere. This place is billed as gourmet and in my opinion it is. My friends had the Tampico chicken sautéed with artichoke and the spinach enchiladas. This was a fantastic dining experience. Even their salsa recipes were unique, not ordinary, and smokey delicious."}
{"text":"Is it bad that I still have nothing good to say? I was forced to come here for a work related lunch yesterday and the food is still as bland as I remember it. The inside is pretty, but the food is so boring."}
{"text":"Dude, the Mexican Apple Pie...  Holy crap...  they get 5 stars just for that."}
{"text":"Nice upscale modern atmosphere. The menu is not your standard Mexican fare. Unique dishes. Good Service. They make their Guacamole fresh at your table and it is very tasty. The Chips comes with 2 salsas, a first roasted and roasted tomatillo. The Fire Roasted is really good, but the roasted Tomatillo is served warm and is definitely an acquired taste. I had a Spinach Enchilada that came with seasoned snap peas and rice. Overall a great dining experience. I would recommend that you try it for yourself and not be deterred by some of the negative reviews on here. After all, if you want Mexican that is standard there are many other places for that in the valley. The food here is definitely gourmet and the quality of the fresh ingredients used is excellent."}
{"text":"Like my fellow Yelp reviewer, Norm, said...I should've listened to my fellow Yelpers about this place. I didn't really have a choice because it was a co-workers going away happy hour.   We had quite a large party of people showing up at intermittent times. Our party in total was about 15-20 people.   They kinda corralled us into an outside fire-pit area. As more people showed up, we struggled with finding seating, so everyone was just kind of standing around. Quite a few of our co-workers showed up with their children. I was a little surprised that they did not even try to accommodate the mothers of our group.   Our server was absolutely terrible. As more people showed up, he didn't even bother asking for their orders and we have to wave him down multiple times. He simply did not take the initiative to take any orders at all. He barely spoke as well. He was very unfriendly (he had a sour look on his face the entire time) and seemed inconvenienced and annoyed by us. It took forever to even get a couple drinks, and when we did get them, the beer wasn't even cold.   I'm not even going to comment on the food, because I was so annoyed with the service that's the only thing I can remember. The only reason I'm not giving this place one star is because the overall atmosphere of Tivoli Village as a whole is enjoyable. It's just a shame that this place doesn't hire the people to compliment that."}
{"text":"Does this restaurant get five stars because of it's ambiance, food, or great service?  No.  Don't get me wrong, it was great food at a decent price, but this review is slightly biased.  Since work sent me out to Arizona for the weekend, I got to see my brother, who I only see a few times a year.  It's weird as you get older, the family that you wanted to get away from to become an individual is the one that you want to get closer and closer to.    Though I had to fly out to Phoenix Saturday morning, do some work, then drive out to Sierra Vista early Sunday, do some work, and drive back to Phoenix the same day (Sierra Vista is about 3 hours away from Phoenix), I would do it all over again just to spend some time with him.  I did remind him that he gave me dog poop and told me it was chocolate when I was a kid though.  That I'll never forget."}
{"text":"You can tell that everything is made fresh! Food and drinks were both excellent!! Service was great-check it out as soon as you can!!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last night, Sunday, November 18, 2012. Ambiance was great, attentive from the moment you walked in, every person working there was smiling, now lets get to the food, what can I say it was fabulous. We started with the guacamole, made table side, they had little jars of condiments and asked you what you would like in it, it was delicious. My son had the Tacos al pastor, they had bits of pineapple in them and smelled and tasted wonderful (we all shared and had a bite of every ones order) I had the Enchiladas de Camerones....what are you kidding me, the shrimp was sweet and succulent, served with a sour cream poblano sauce that made my eye roll to the back of my head. My father had the Enchiladas Veracruz, which was a chicken enchilada with tomatillo sauce and queso fresco, old adage to \"Die For\". We topped off our meal with flan that was so smooth and light, my dad had the Mexican Apple Pie, with a Mexican Brandy butter and homemade cinnamon ice cream. I had the Mango Tres Leches cake, all I can say is that this cake deserves it's own holiday, it should be celebrated. If you have a chance to go there, what are you waiting for.....FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"Eh... the food was only ok. Prices were appropriate. My chicken soft taco and chicken enchilada lunch special was under $10 but they were both flavorless; really boring. Waiter was fine and service was good. Their computer went down while we were there so we had to wait for our check which was totally fine; no ones fault and the manager came out to apologize which was nice. The environment was nice, But honestly the food was less than average so I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Stopped while on business and got right in for a bar seat. Happy hour till 7 ! And great menu offerings of drinks and beers at great prices . I had the fajitas combo and it was well prepared and tasty with fresh veggies under generous portions of meats. Great service in managing the bar all true way around"}
{"text":"The service is usually really great. I say that because only 1 night have I questioned this and it was a party of 20+. The food is great and comes out very fast. The location can not be beat, who doesn't love the Tivoli Village area? They have a margaritas with a beer and a shot attached which can creep on you so be cautious when ordering this stinger.  Enjoy a lovely evening under the stars or indoors. We personally love their patio."}
{"text":"The food is great.  The best salsa I've had, but they must be rationing it.  The service sucks.  I've been here 6 to 8 times. The service has sucked every time. I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"This is the first Cantina Laredo I have been to.  The guacamole prepared table-side and the pablano pepper stuffed with cheese and shrimp and wrapped in steak break my heart they're so good.  Now that they have opened one nearby in Sandestin, FL, I'm in heaven."}
{"text":"I went here for happy hour today and I was very pleased!  The restaurant is beautiful, the waiter was attentive, the food was great, the chips/salsa were complementary, and the beer was cold, frosty, and delicious -- what more could one want?!!??  The happy hour deal is AMAZING (half off appetizers, $2 beer, $4 large margaritas.... awesome!).  I would go back in a heart beat to the happy hour; however, I am unable to comment on the regular service (I'm assuming it is a little more expensive, but great overall!  :) ) Also, they have a GREAT patio that I would love to check out during the fall time.  Lastly, my mom also loved the food, food, salsa, and layout of the restaurant -- very impressive that it appealed to both of us!     I was full, content, and happy after said happy hour here.  I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Best house margarita ever.  Bar service is great favorite place in San tan.  Happy hour 4-7 we usually eat happy hour specials and they fill us up.  Tequila dinner every quarter is a MUST!"}
{"text":"bacon-wrapped shrimp fajitas.  that's all you need to know. fucking delicious.  server Jackie was great. guacamole was a little spicy, which was a neat surprise. we managed to come on the evening of some high school's home coming, and according to my wife, modern homecoming dresses are way too hoochy for decency; I guess it is a little unusual to see 17 year old gash in public. the happy hour specials are amazing!"}
{"text":"We've heard good and bad things, but wanted to check it out for ourselves.  Went on a weekday evening, noticed the patio area to the left...asked the hostess to sit there and she directed us to the other patio on the right. Still nice, but was loud...music and singing from the bar or restaurant next door.  Ordered the ceviche and the blood orange sangria to start. Both great, although if you don't care for olives ask to have them removed. The blood orange sangria was great!  For dinner we ordered the chicken and barbacoa tacos. Both had good flavor, not great, but was definitely expensive. 3 \"street\" tacos, small bed of rice and small bed of beans...for $17 it didn't seem reasonable.  I don't recall our servers name although he was good, he did have to yell...since it was loud, not his fault but definitely something the hostess and management should consider before seating patrons on that patio. My only gripe with the server is he disappeared...and from what it looked like to the other patio...maybe they had him serving there as well?  Driving from Silverado Ranch to Tivoli to go there again just doesn't seem worth it. Maybe if we lived in the area...but won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great atmosphere! My wife and Started with the casaritas which were perfect! We ordered the table side guacamole which was prepared by Edward who was very friendly and had great customer service skills. The food was great but be warned that the habanero salsa is very, very spicy...and delicious too! We had a great time and the price was very fair. We highly recommend this Resturant!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent Mexican food is served here. Plus, it has a very clean and upscale ambiance. Service was friendly and prompt. Despite the nice setting, I would not consider this place to be overly expensive."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Cinco DE drinko. Long line. They told us it was going to be a 30 minute wait. After only 15 minutes we were in. The food was great. Our waiter Monty was attentive, professional and very friendly. The manager stopped by. We were not hurried and received excellent service."}
{"text":"I've checked in to Cantina Laredo 8 times since my initial review in 2013.  My last update, for dinner about a year ago or more, which wasn't very complimentary, has mysteriously disappeared.  And it's not relegated to the \"Not Recommended\" list either, which is usually populated by newbie Yelpers who just might be friends of the owner or paid to write reviews.  I'm neither.  Go figure.  Not the first time this has happened, and probably won't be the last.  But I'm kinda glad it's not there.  Because when we decided to give it another try tonight, we were happy to find that it has returned to its former glory.    Playing Goldilocks again, I checked inside. It was too cold.  The patio was too hot.  The cafe across the street had misters, and that would have been just right, but we weren't eating there.  So we sat on the patio, glanced longingly at those misters, and cooled off with some tall and refreshing Sangrias - White Honey for me and Blood Orange for Mr. +1. Both drinks were great, with the white seeming a bit more potent.  Figures, since I usually do the driving.  They're both amped up with liqueurs added to the mix, but neither has fresh fruit.  That's okay - more of what counts.  We went straight to the entrees, and my Pollo Escondido, a chicken breast sliced and filled with small shrimp, was covered with a rich and flavorful sauce enhanced with spinach.  \"Hidden Chicken\" is spicy, but not overbearingly.  I guess it should have been called \"Hidden Shrimp,\" but that would have ignored the star of the dish.  My husband ordered a dish new to the menu, Guiso de Pollo, a chicken stew in a dry (meaning not swimming) green sauce, filled with veggies and rice.  I tasted it, and it was excellent.    My mouth was watering for the Mango Tres Leches dessert, remembering just how delicious it is, but my stomach cried \"No!,\" so regretfully we passed.  What made our dinner even more enjoyable was our server, Jessica, a lovely cubana.  In addition to her outstanding service, I relished being able to talk with her in Spanish and learn about her life coming to and living in the U.S.  For now she works only Friday, Saturday and Monday, so when we return it will definitely be on one of those nights.  It was a refreshing antidote to the surly server who (dis)graced our previous visits.  The other positive factor was learning that some of the changes that had left us disgruntled last time have been rolled back.  So now, if you order a bowl of their tortilla soup, you'll get a bowlful, not a tablespoon-sized portion.  I loved having Cantina Laredo close by, and now am happy to love it again."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Margaritas delicious! Servers very attentive and informative. Nice atmosphere! Loved chips and guacamole made table side"}
{"text":"I was craving one of their margarita's after I tried their Jalapeno margarita at a Yelp elite event! Unfortunately I didn't see it on the menu so I tried the Mango Margarita.  I also loved this drink I could have easily ordered another one but I practiced self control! I hope one day that they will add the Jalapeno Margarita to their list.  We started off with the table side guacamole which was awesome! They always make it look so easy compared to when I try to make it at home. It was worth the extra $8.95 because it was so delicious!  I ordered a not so Mexican dish but I was craving it so I was like, \"Why not\"? The Cascabel Rib eye ($24.95) is a cowboy cut bone in rib eye. It is aged for 21 days then basted with Cascabel marinade. It was so good and so tender ! This is a great price compared to some places I ate steak or rib eye at! The side potatoes that it came with was meh .... I personally think they should replace them with mashed potatoes. You can't go wrong with rib eye and mashed potatoes!   We ordered two desserts to share for the table. We had the sizzling Mexican Apple Pie. It is sizzled in Mexican brandy butter and topped with either Cinnamon ice cream or vanilla. I chose the Cinnamon ice cream it went together beautifully! We also had the Mexican Brownie which also was sizzled in Mexican brandy butter which was topped with vanilla ice cream. That was also tasty. If you come here you should try at least one dessert !  The service was awesome and attentive! We always had refills on our chips and drinks! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was craving a mango margarita.  Thanx to Yelp I found this awesome Mexican/American place near my house. We sat at the bar.  I had the mango margarita (strong-love it!)  3 tacos (chicken, barbacoa, beef) w/ a side of guacamole...;) yummy! Uh did I mention the chips and dip are addicting?! Super fresh and delicious!   The service was exceptional.  Eduardo our bartender/server is such a professional and super fun to be around. Eduardo really makes you feel at home and makes the best drinks.  I'll be back! (Terminator voice) ;)hehe"}
{"text":"Wow, everything tastes so good and fresh, from the chips and salsa to the queso to the (freshly made to our likes) guacamole. The Barbacoa tacos were my favorite but after trying pretty much everything it it was hard to find anything that wasn't absolutely amazing.  Monika makes a mean margarita also! You can't beat their happy hour."}
{"text":"This is a good Mexican restaurant, not great, but good. The chips and salsa are very good, salsa super fresh and tasty! Drinks are good too! I will definitely come back for drinks and appetizers in the bar area. Dinner was okay. My husband had the ribeye which came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. (He liked it) I just can't bring myself to order steak and mashed potatoes at a Mexican restaurant..... That is what I would order a couple doors down at the steak house in Tivoli Village (which is excellent, by the way) My dinner was the enchiladas. One chicken and one cheese. The cheese had red sauce and the chicken had a cream poblano sauce. I preferred the cream poblano sauce of the two. The tortilla on the enchiladas had to much of a bite to it, like it wasn't cooked long enough. I prefer a soft tortilla. Just wasn't exactly to my liking. So many Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas make fresh homemade tortillas, I have gotten spoiled. Beans and rice served with the enchiladas were so so....... beans were good, but rice was undercooked and very disappointing."}
{"text":"I've seen this place at the Santan mall a few times on my way out and noticed it had a happy hour so I took my bf for a whirl. The HH is actually really nice! The house margaritas are reasonably priced and very delicious (my mouth is watering just thinking about it) They also have XX which pleased the bf. We had a chicken quesadillas appetizer and shared the tacos al carbon. Both were super delicious, the meat was juicy and the meal was huge! I was very happy with the service we received here which was our bartender. I will definetely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here with some co-workers yesterday and really enjoyed it. This is their favorite restaurant near the office and neither has been in a long time so they took me for the first time.  Our server was nice and to the point, got us some drinks, chips, salsa and guac faster than you can blink. They make the guac table side which is always fun, but they may want to consider adding a touch of salt in the mix.  I had the beef tacos and the beef was really flavorful. It had some avocado and either onions and tomatoes or something like a pico de gallo since I think there were some jalapenos in the mix as well. Either way it was good and fresh.  The rice side was good too, nice and aldente unlike some other places that serve mush. The two others had the cilantro and pollo salad and the mango salad and both were impressed and full. These salads were huge.  We sat and talked for a while and our server didn't bug us at all so that was nice too. I will go back to this place with my co-workers for sure. Keep your eyes peeled for little birds in the joint too...somehow they got in. No idea what that does to the health code, but I'm not bothered by it."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre and smallish portions. Wait-staff was insufficient for the number of diners.  Prices high for the quality of food. One menu for our party of 4 was an old menu that was not correct.  Our waiter was fine and served us quickly and in a friendly manner."}
{"text":"I found my new favorite brunch spot! The brunch menu items are served with a complimentary mimosa or bloody maria. You get a huge portion, a side of potatoes and fresh fruit served in a cinnamon sugar tortilla cup. The entrees we ordered were about $11 each, so all that and a drink is such a great deal!   I ordered the huevos divorciados. Its a corn cake with 2 eggs on top with a green sauce on one side, red on the other. Both sauces were amazing, but I liked the green more. The corn cake was perfect, looks like a pancake but not sweet. My husband ordered the chicken fajita omelette, which was huge. The sauce thats on top is so good. Lots of chicken and veggies with plenty of cheese but not overloaded.   Service was very friendly and our food came out so fast I was surprised. From other yelp reviews I've seen they offer $2 mimosas on Sundays. We had a second one after the complimentary, but we weren't charged. So thanks Cantino Laredo for great service, great food, and free drinks!"}
{"text":"Going during happy hour and take advantage of their appetizers. We ordered the quesadilla, tacos, and nachos and all of them were fantastic and much cheaper then the rest of the menu. We also took advantage of the outside seating which was great because we love to people watch and their are many walking around the mall."}
{"text":"I came here recently for a week night date night with the bae. I give it an A+ for design. I love that there's an outdoor patio which given the current season isn't great but would love to come back in the summer.  The service was good but nothing too extraordinary. I did enjoy our waiter telling us how the margaritas are made completely in house with no mixes. A nice natural touch. Also Thursday are ladies nights so half off house margs.  The food was good as well. We have the queso blanco dip to start which had a different flavor from the typical queso dips. For an entree we split the tres fajita. I loved the chicken and steak but the bacon wrapped shrimp I could do without. The only thing I loathed about the meal with the side of beans. Waaaay too salty for any human consumption.  Overall a nice place with great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Torn between being posh, slick, spacious and frat friendly and serving quality Mexican food and meeting neither end, Cantina Laredo embodies a niche that caters mildly and passably to both culinary risk-averse Americans and seekers of quality Mexican food.  After sitting down with my parents and them not bolting for the door upon reading the menu despite the daunting task of pronouncing their selections, I at least knew it would be a peaceful, quiet occasion. The entire evening was filled with moments in between:  - Complimentary chips and salsa, too watery to those seeking Frito Lay's interpretation or Pico de Gallo, but not flavorful enough to satisfy those looking for legitimate salsa - Filet Portabella ($27): soft, succulent beef and a large portabella in a rich mushroom sauce, a yield of decidedly non-Mexican excellence - Camarones Escondidos ($19): unremarkable chicken, average shrimp, meek sauce - Monterrey plate ($13): moderately balanced spinach enchilada, a chicken enchilada with a deep, satisfying mole, and a third Veracruz enchilada that I've forgotten already - Crepes ($6): Apple, more French than Mexican, more sweet to a fault than enjoyable - \"Mexican\" Brownie ($6): An overpoweringly excessively sugary heart attack brownie on a skillet with extra artery clogging brandy butter that was not a good caloric investment  There are flashes of brilliance and enough options to placate the uninitiated but like most stealth chains has succumbed to not being able to please all its many masters simultaneously and has settled for being \"alright.\" For mixed culinary company, you could do far worse so it defends its niche, but for a homogeneous party, keep looking."}
{"text":"Happy hour here is the best!  Cantina is one of the only places at Santan that doesn't water down the shits during happy hour.  For this reason, I love to come here with friends for happy hour"}
{"text":"I had enjoyed some really good lunches and happy hours here a year or so back. Yesterday I walked in with a friend around 2:00 in the afternoon. It was for the most part completely empty. No one at the bar and no bartender in site. We waited a good ten minutes before anyone even came up front to seat us. I decided to pass.......when all the other places are packed on a beautiful afternoon and this one had no one in it.....I had really bad feelings.  Hope I'm wrong,"}
{"text":"Complimentary chips and salsa. Their camaron poblano asada was amazing. You just have to try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Eaten here several times.   Its really good.  Its not cheap, but its not steam table covered in canned sauce.  Try the cocktails.  They really have some killer house drinks.  We did the tequila dinner.  Highly suggest it.  Worth every penny.  To go there and not get the tableside guac is a total loss.  Love love love mexican food.  Its kicked up and not your normal beef enchiladas. But!   Its not cheap either. You are going to pay more."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to come here for dinner. I was very hungry and looked forward to some delicious dishes. My impression was not great and I have tasted better Mexican food. The refried beans tasted like they came from a can and the rice was not that good. The chicken flautas were ok, but they did not seem fresh and tasted like they were cooked from frozen. This is a nice place for drinks, as Cantina Ladero has a beautiful ambience. Not impressed at all with the food. It was just...ok.  :/"}
{"text":"This place was over priced and just not very good.  There were 5 of us and only person liked their meal (and now I can't remember what it was!) If you are in San Tan...go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I came her last weekend with two other guests. I'm basing my rating on the average of our three scores... We all really wanted to like this place.  It started off great!  The chips and salsa they bring to the table are delicious and addicting.  I was excited to order the fresh guacamole but then it started going downhill.  I only had one bite of the guacamole - I thought it tasted nasty.  One of my guests had only one bite while the other guests took out the grilled jalepenos that were mixed in it and found it to be \"ok\". On to entrees....one guest ordered a chicken burrito that was \"ok\"- It was swimming in this creme sauce that he tried taking off.  The waitress kept stressing that she recommended the tacos - I should've listened to her!  My other guest ordered tacos and they looked nice and fresh. I ordered off the brunch menu and got the omelet with potatoes and these cinnamon fried bananas.  The bananas were good but the omelet was dripping with oil!  And the potatoes had a REALLY WEIRD taste to them - they were uneatable!  Ewwwww.  I mentioned this to the waitress with the suggestion that the chef taste the batch being served (I didn't want anyone getting sick from them) and she just smiled and said ok.  Once we asked for our check it took 20 minutes to get it... They weren't busy.  Maybe understaffed?  I paid the check and I have no plans of returning.  I can get way better food thats edible at the Suncoast cafe across the street- and still have money left to play wheel of fortune! My other guest said they would never return again either, while the other said he would just come for a drink and a taco appetizer.  Bummer....."}
{"text":"Awesome!! Great food and service!! Cool atmosphere too :) Drinks are strong and delicious. I had the passion fruit Rita and it was amazing."}
{"text":"Fine dining Mexican! Love the pomegranate mojitos and the complimentary warm, fire roasted salsa. Highly recommends the fish tacos with cilantro-lime rice and black bean dip as side dishes.   Very friendly towards kids with a big kid and small kid menu."}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo at The San Tan Mall  We were taking our daughter to see a movie at the San Tan and never have dined at Cantina Laredo, so we decided to give it a try. We were thoroughly impressed with the general facility and the attention to detail that it contains; eclectic with Spanish overtones. The place was immaculate.   The food was fantastic! I had the Cantina Laredo Platter: Cheese chile relleno, tamale, chicken enchilada, fajita beef taco al carbon. I thoroughly enjoyed this plate. The relleno was super gooey cheesy and the beef in the taco was exceptional and reminded me of something my mother-in-law would make when we travel to New Mexico.    The glaring problem with this restaurant is the service. It was absolutely terrible. When we sat down it was nearly 15 minutes before we were greeted. The server never mentioned any specials and was not knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered a Queso dip for the table which was good but not exceptional; however, I was extremely irritated when I overheard the server at the next table offer tableside Guacamole to his guests. HELLO! WTF! I love guacamole.  Then I sat irritated in my chair as I watched the neighbor's guacamole being prepared fresh tableside....eeeerrrrrr. In addition, our Queso dip came out late and our dinners early as the courses were annoyingly overlapped. Why even bother ordering an appetizer if you don't get a chance to eat it.   My wife has a sweet tooth and always looks forward to dessert. Not here though as we got the automatic check drop without being asked for coffee or dessert.   My wife and daughter went shopping before the movie so I moved to the bar to test the house margaritas. I never got to because I sat at the bar by myself for exactly 18 minutes without ever being greeted let alone served. So I got up and left and went to Kona Grill for a drink instead. By the way, a Gaggle of hostesses all up front and not one mentioned to say goodbye.   Wow! Great place, Great food and then this place really shoots itself in the foot with its absolutely lousy service."}
{"text":"Hostess was not very educated on what is considered the bar area and where happy hour pricing is active."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try this place out for a few months.  An old friend in town was the perfect excuse.  Located in beautiful Tivoli Village, parking was a breeze, though I imagine peak times on the weekend might take a bit longer. Indoor and outdoor seating is a great feature, with outdoor seating on both the side and in front.  We chose a spot inside since it was 1pm and pretty hot out.  Our server was spot on with everything including letting us know about the grilled salmon special. Nice selection of beers including Carta Blanca, Tecate, Dos XX, Corona, etc...along with margaritas, and a decent wine selection.   We ordered the queso laredo dip as an appetizer and it didn't dissapoint.  Most of the appetizers are for 2-4 people to share. The 2 salsas they bring along with the chips are excellent as well.  The main dishes are small compared to what most folks might be used to at a Mexican restaurant.  However, the food quality is great, fresh, tasty and suprisingly filling.  I ordered the Tacos Barbacoa, and would again, although there are so many great menu options to try.  My friend had a different Tacos plate and loved his as well.  We abstained from dessert and coffee, and they don't have espresso, just regular brewed coffee available.  Hopefully, they'll invest in an espresso machine and train the staff here soon.  Total lunch bill for 2 people with a shared appetizer and a couple beers was just over $40.00.  So my opinion is price for the quality is a good deal.  It's not a bargain, huge plates or a buffet style Mexican restaurant.  If that's what you might be looking for, this really isn't the place, and you probably won't feel you are getting your $ worth.  This was a weekday at lunch so dinner prices and larger crowds may affect the price and server dynamic. That being said, I would highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I could go on and on, but let me just say this... Definitely NOT even close to Mexican food! Not worth a $75 dinner for two people. I have to say the guacamole was good, but you can't go wrong with fresh ingredients made right in front of you.  Waiter was super busy and never around, nice guy but too sweaty!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite local Mexican restaurant!  I especially love going for Sunday brunch and mimosa drink specials. The artichoke enchiladas are fantastic!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant's flare on Mexican Food.  It was light, fresh and healthy.  I had the Chicken Enchiladas with the Tomatillo sauce.  They were delicious.  They offered fresh zucchini made how my mom would make it... Calabasa style.  I ate everything except for the garnish and did not feel stuffed.  That is unusual for restaurant food.  My friend had the fish tacos and he really enjoyed them.  The salsa was as wonderful as they said in these other reviews.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has always had the worst waiters; lazy, rude, incompetent.   You need to ask for refills of drinks, chips for dips and usually at least twice for a glass of water. That's once your waiter actually arrives, having made you wait for 15 minutes first.  And the food is bland, mediocre at best  I know that going in.   Tonight was the last straw and I'll never go back  The nasty Mexican hostess, the one with the braces, seated a party of 8 and a party of 2 before coming back to get myself and my dining companion.  I asked for a booth, as I could see that there were 5 empty ones in the back.   She said, \"there's a fifteen minute wait.\"  Mind you, my dining companion and I were the only two waiting and it's not the type of place that gives beepers out so that you can roam around. There's no place to roam.   So I said, \"fine, we'll sit anywhere.\" As there were at least 12 empty tables in the main dining room. 5 empty tables on the outdoor patio and the bar was COMPLETELY empty  \"It's still 15 minutes,\" she said, laughing.  So I laughed back at her and said, \"I'm not waiting 15 seconds since there are 30 empty tables in the restaurant,\" and proceeded to walk out and drive 15 minutes away to a different type of restaurant, just out of principle.   And will NEVER GO BACK.   And I wish there was a way to give NEGATIVE stars."}
{"text":"I was looking to take my Mom to a nice Mexican restaurant while she was visiting Phoenix; more specifically the Queen Creek/Gilbert metroplex. She is from nowhere-Kentucky and gets Mexican dining in small buildings where the taco/enchilada combo plate is the house specialty. We were planning on seeing a movie afterwards, so I ventured to San Tan Village and visited Cantina Laredo.   The restaurant had a nice decor and atmosphere. The seating was nice (but I think they found the smallest table for us). The waiter I think was also the bartender, but it was slow at noon on Sunday, so he waited tabled. I think his name was Stuart. Very nice guy. The chips and salsa arrived and I dug in. Three bowls of salsa - two red and typical salsa (very good) and one warm that didn't really blow my skirt up. I passed on that and ordered the table-made guacamole. It is just under $10 for the guacamole, but it was very good and well worth it. Stuart used three full avocados in making the dip. I ordered the Puerto Vallarta, which was a combination platter with two enchiladas and a rolled up soft taco. The meal was very good and very filling - but I didn't stop there...  thanks to my mobile app for Yelp I detected the review indicating if I passed on the sizzling brownie I was selling myself short - so I went for it. It did not disappoint! Stuart brought out the brownie, the butter cream and ice cream separately and prepared the dish. The plate was hot cast iron, the brownie went on, mushed in a spot for the vanilla ice cream and put the sauce on the plate. It started to sizzle and smelled almost of butterscotch. He spooned it on top of the ice cream. My mom said \"this is the best dessert I have ever had!\"  The good quality was good (the sauce on the chicken enchiada was excellent) and the service was awesome. Stuart kept the drinks filled and prepared the guacamole and brownie well at the table. Very nice guy too. It was a bit pricey - 3 lunches, the guacamole and dessert for $63 ($75 after tip), but it was very good. I will be back - if nothing else, for the guac and brownie!"}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo is so much fun!  I enjoyed dining here not only because the menu sounded muy delicioso, not only because we had a gift card, it was because we are always served STELLAR service!  For appetizers we split the Queso Laredo With taco meat and pico de gallo to compliment the chips and salsa on the house.  I ordered for my entree the Chimichanga de Pollo high is a fried flour tortilla filled with fajita chicken, poblano pepper, cheese and topped with chili con queso because.. YOLO!!  For dessert.... my second time devouring this beautiful masterpiece was the Mexican apple pie!! It comes out sizzling on a HOTTER than hell fajita plate half uncooked in Mexican brandy butter, with cinnamon ice cream. *droooool* Every. Single. Bite. Eaten. We would have licked the plate but.. like I said before, it was hotter than hell! The waitress and I hit it off so well and I complimented her haircut/color she was so beyond sweet she returned with the name and phone number of her hairdresser for me! **awwwwwww** I love it here, ready to move in!"}
{"text":"Horrible service - Waitress rang in the wrong items, food came before the drinks, dropped off check while we finally got the right orders....very disappointed because we were hopeful for a good Mexican option at Crocker Park...THIS IS NOT IT"}
{"text":"Had \"happy hour\" appetizers and drinks with friends.  Great staff!  We each bough a different appetizer (6 in all), so we could sample the various items.  Really good chips (thin and crispy) and salsa, and the chicken quesidilla was very good.  Margaritas were good.  Can't remember everything else, but we were all satisfied.  Very upscale place inside.  Would return if in the area again."}
{"text":"My post might be a bit biased since I spent the entire night and next day in front my of toilet.  Not 100% sure the cause was the food here but aside from that, there was nothing here that would make me come back for.  The food is over priced and not special.  Ordered the al pastor tacos, which were just mediocre and when I had asked the waitress about whether the meat came from that huge vertical roasting stick she had no clue. (dont think it did since the meat was more of pulled pork style)"}
{"text":"Fantastic signature margaritas! The best I have had in Vegas.  Good Flavorful salsa. Both of which for me....make or break it."}
{"text":"I am absolutely in heaven, enjoying the enchilada veracruz right now. It's light and healthy - filled with chicken and spinach, with a side of grilled zucchini, but it is huge in flavors and totally hits the spot. It has a little kick to it, which is perfect. Their chips and salsa are great - the chips are light and crispy, lightly salted.. And I still can't decide which salsa I like best of the two.   The house margarita is tasty. A little sweeter than I'm normally used to, but it pairs well with the dish. The server is fantastic and everything came out quick. Definitely a spot to hit again if I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times now and each time is better and better! From the spectacular and friendly service to the delectable food. I am obsessed and addicted to lime cilantro rice! Anytime I come to Vegas, this is  MUST for me to do! It's just not a memorable Vegas excursion without eating here and drinking delicious margaritas."}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo is a bit pricy but is a nice treat. I've eaten here several times and almost always get the enchiladas Veracruz with a cabo flip margarita. Happy hour is great too but only available in the bar. The case Rita is $5 on happy hour, it's not bad but not good as the flip. Also have had the carnitas sliders, shrimp empanadas, and the fajita tacos off the happy hour menu all are good but would pass on the fajita tacos in the future because there was nothing special about them. The shrimp empanadas were fantastic though. The guacamole is good but pricy and I've tasted the enchiladas de mole and thought it was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Well, I would like to write a review based on my experience eating here, but unfortunately that's not possible. We sat at a table for 20 minutes without acknowledgement from any waiter, though there were several working the outdoor area where the unfriendly hostess had seated us. Sadly, we ended up walking out. We won't be back."}
{"text":"My family went here a couple of weeks ago. We wished we had tried it out sooner!!! The frozen and rocks margaritas were strong and refreshing. We order a bowl of queso first and it was tasty. The children ordered off the children's menu and got mini sliders w/fries and a quesadilla with rice. Both were very content with their dishes. My husband ordered the tres fajitas and I can't tell you which protein was best! The bacon wrapped shrimp were amazing, the beef was so tender that my son started in on dad's plate.  The chicken was moist and cooked to perfection. I ordered chicken tacos... Another great dish. We will be back for sure. It was more expensive than typical Mexican food but I would say it was far superior than most typical Mexican food. Keep doing what your doing."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend last night for dinner and had an overall pleasant experience. Our waitress was super nice and friendly and was very thorough in explaining the menu to us. I ordered enchiladas and my friend got tacos. The portions are a bit on the smaller side but everything tasted pretty good. I got the white wine sangria as well, but to be honest it wasn't anything especially unique. Still enjoyed it nonetheless!   All in all, it was a spacious and nicely decorated restaurant, the food was decent, and the service was exceptional so I'll give it three stars."}
{"text":"This place suprised me.   We were waiting for a table at a nearby Sushi place and my wife and spotted this Restaurant.  AMAZING food.  The Guacamole was made at the table, fresh, and tasted great.  The Fiesta Grill was amazing.  I would recommend this to everyone.  Delicious food, fantastic atmosphere.  My wife and I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"It was ok. The guacamole at your table thing takes way too long and I just sat there staring at my waiter mashing an avocado at someone else's table wishing they would just finish and come back to me because I needed to order something. Way to stuffy and I won't be back."}
{"text":"We came to this place on a whim and regretted every bite. The restaurant is priced as a high-end  contemporary Mexican but is apparently TexMex-inspired... but you'd never know it until your food arrives.    The $20 \"Camarones Escondidos\" dish, described as a chicken breast stuffed with shrimp, was an overcooked chicken breast laid on top of some pre-cooked baby shrimp.  I could forgive baby shrimp of the dish were only $10 but it's actually $20, which is frankly insulting.   The beef enchiladas contained no cheese and are covered in \"Tex Mex\" chili con carne instead of enchilada sauce, which was a shock to our table as we have never experienced this sort of thing at any Mexican restaurant, ever.  What kind of enchilada doesn't have cheese?  We expressed disappointment about the enchiladas to our server who helped us replace it with tacos, as a manager stood over his shoulder interjecting comments, making the entire thing very uncomfortable.   The replacement beef tacos weren't much of an improvement. The meat felt mushy, as if it had been sitting in a crock pot for a full day.     We also got fish tacos which weren't very good. The fish was clearly not fresh and the rice and beans that came on the side tasted bad and were served cold.  They did replace the rice and beans for us but it didn't help much in terms of flavor. Even hot, the food was still bad.   Needless to say, we left extremely disappointed. Just really bad food with service that tried to fix the issue but just couldn't.  Giving this place one star for trying to correct the issue but the manager seemed to have an attitude even when trying to help. The food was so awful that I cannot in good conscience recommend this place to anybody.  This place could be great but needs a new chef and menu overhaul, ASAP."}
{"text":"Average. Not spicy. Not Tex-Mex. Not Mexican. Apple pie or brownies for desert. House Margarita was average. The lack of spice made it seem like it was for an older crowd. On a positive note; the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent service. The food was very good. The best apple pie I've had in a long time. The fajitas Appetizer was a good portion, carne assada cooked just right. I really enjoyed both times I've gone there."}
{"text":"A strip mall restaurant.  The decor could be a steak house, so don't go expecting atmosphere. The food was good and reasonably priced for the N. Scottsdale area. And who can screw up a margarita? Wait staff was perfunctory and sometimes indifferent.  The place was about half full, but our waiter had to be found to put in orders and to get our check. In short, ordinary service."}
{"text":"(Writing under my husband's yelp account - from his wife Debbie S. !) --- If you are looking for a great restaurant in Las Vegas to hold a private event -- look no further! I cannot begin to say enough things about my recent experience with Cantina Laredo in Las Vegas and specifically working with the manager, Matt Lynch. I was hosting a baby shower for my sister who lives in Vegas + 35 guests but I was planning from Arizona. Needless to say, I could not have been more relieved after doing a ton of research for Vegas restaurants when I came across Cantina Laredo. From the beginning, Matt was extremely responsive, helpful with detailed information, flexible with the menu and our various requests, always happy to answer any questions we had and went above and beyond by sharing pictures, suggestions etc. They have a great private room that can accomodate up to 40 people and they are located within Tivolli Village so the ambiance around the restaurant is also great. This gave me such peace of mind knowing we were working with a manager who wanted to ensure we had the best experience possible - not only at the event but during the planning process. The morning of the event, Matt and his staff (specifically our server, Jackie), could not have been more helpful and accomodating. They provided fantastic service throughout the entire event. Many guests commented on how delicious the food was and how prompt the service was, especially for a group of 35 people. Others commented on how great of a place it was to hold a special event. Could not have been happier with our experience from start to finish!"}
{"text":"Food not good, water was taken from the toilet i think, and service was only so so.  Just another fancy name, with fancy atmosphere, but they forgot to serve food that is edible.  And though you can order a variety of drinks, sometimes washing food down with a glass of water is nice. any restaurant that can't invest in a simple RO system for drinking water or to make their drinks with, shouldn't be charging $12 for an appetizer.  Small price to pay for a comfort that goes a long way."}
{"text":"Cool casual affordable Mexican food with great flavor! Angel our server was on great, you could instantly tell he's a veteran in the game, he was very pleasant in his tone and took excellent care of us, very attentive and responsive. Offered us a margarita and appetizers which we did not have but it is always wise to offer your guests things like this or make personal suggestions to build rapport. Great menu selection, I had three tacos and a Corona light, my wife the flautas, chips and salsa with some food left over to go, under $30 for a nice lil late lunch. The manager also came over and simply thanked us for dinning with them with is always welcomed by guests as it makes them feel important. Great place, family friendly and great food.  I do wish they had larger beer mugs as your typical beer does not pour all the way into the standard glass they provide. Also wish the lighting and decor could be a little more lively!! But over all a smooth operation and nice music at Cantina Laredo :-)"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with some friends on Cinco de Mayo.  We made reservations but arrived early enough that they really weren't needed.  Still we had a nice booth right by the window and that was very pleasant.  The dining room is quite large and did seem to get pretty busy as the night wore on.  Our server, Jose, was very patient and attentive.  The food was pretty average.  We started w/ chips and salsa, pretty average there but served with 2 versions of salsa.  The cheese queso dip was ok, but a little too Velveeta cheesey for my taste.  Jose kept us supplied in chips.  I had enchiladas veracruz w/ chicken & spinach.  Came w/ a side of zucchini was really quite tasty.  Not so much for the bland rice.  One companion had the chicken enchiladas.  He said they were ok but they sure looked unappealing to me covered with a white sour cream/cheese sauce topping, so pale on the plate.  Our friends enjoyed their margaritas and at $5 seemed like a pretty good deal.    We spent a long time after dinner visiting while still seated in the booth and did not feel rushed to leave.  That might have been the best part of the experience.  This is pretty typical chain food and there are so many better, unique Mexican options in the area.  Nothing about the meal made me want to rush back but if the occasion calls for a return, I would be agreeable."}
{"text":"I do like the margaritas here. They are very strong so be careful! The food is good, but the menu is on the expensive side for Mexican (strip prices, around $12 for margaritas). The staff is very friendly. The patio is nice and there is also a bar outside on the patio which is fun as long as it's not too hot outside."}
{"text":"I suppose I hold warm fuzzy memories of Cantina Laredo because it's the first real dinner date I had with the boyfran, but I think I'd love this place regardless. It's more fancy than your average, run of the mill, drench everything in queso dip, Americanized Mexican place. (Not that there's anything wrong with places like that. Heck no.) It IS a chain, albeit a small and tasteful one, rather than an On The Border-esque clusterfuck.  I ordered the enchiladas de avocado and booooy howdy were they delicious! Served over sautéed spinach and bursting with avocado and artichokes, they were an awesome veggie entree. The tomatillo sauce covering them was divine, but unfortunately there was a sour cream drizzle (not described on the menu) that I had to scrape off (sour cream = barf) thus removing lots of the sauce. Wah!  Our server was kind of crazy town and spastic, but overall it was an awesome experience. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed Happy Hour again today and want to thank Stewart for always giving us the BEST service ever!!  Food is always great as well!"}
{"text":"Tableside guacamole, incredible queso, and a scrumptious taco selection! Great place for a night out or just to grab a quick bite. New to the area and highly recommend coming here for your Mexican food cravings!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of chain Mexican restaurants - but Cantina Laredo consistently delivers on food and service.  They have an updated menu with some new items as well as some old favorites like the carne asada.   They also have a menu just for lunch with some lower priced options and a kids menu with both mexican and american food choices.   It will please even the picky eaters!"}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is pricey!!!  I am not cheap but 12 bucks for a margarita??  Why not have the kick ass margarita at Los dos Molinos for about the same price but really gets you messed up and tastes great!  The food at Cantina Laredo is very expensive too, nothing under 10 bucks WTF?? Anyway they do use quality meats, the chicken & the beef were excellent however the stuff surrounding them was below average. The masa on the tamale was mushy, the tortilla & the sauce on the enchilada was less than desirable. We did enjoy the fajita taco & the chili relleno though.  Due to the many guacamole reviews on here we just had to try it.... Above average I guess but way too limey for my taste.  So for being expensive & not that great of food I probably will not go back, however I must give props to our waitress Jocelyn, she was unbelievable!!!! We have not had exceptional service like that in years, she was so phenomenal we even called the manager over to let him know of our experience!!!  I absolutely would have given this place one or two stars but bumped it up to three because of the service!"}
{"text":"Tasty, reliable Mexican food. Been here several times.  The highlight is always the table made guacamole, made to your specifications (i.e. I tell them to give my husband the jalapenos as I can't handle the spice). The fajitas and barbacoa tacos are my favorites. My husband tries something different every time and has never had a bad meal.   I've never had bad service here. We generally like to come for lunch."}
{"text":"Have to say there are days that go by where all I crave is your queso! I love popping in to the bar having friendly service killer drinks and cheesy queso to end a long day. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I've been here about 10 times and am always pleased.  We always get great service and the food is always outstanding!  The chicken enchiladas are my favorite in the valley!"}
{"text":"I went on a saturday night with my husband-it was pretty empty. we decided to sit outside on the patio, next to the firepit, which really made for great ambiance. It was just really nice. I loved the mix of music that was playing on the speakers. Salsa and all sort of spanish music.  Food was ok-the rice was over seasoned but still edible. Nice place..I'd go back."}
{"text":"Stopped by on Friday for dinner. I really like their cocktail and food menu here.   I like the chips and salsa here. The two salsas they put out are really good - especially the spicy one.   Their traditional mojito remains one of my favorites. Ordered the Queso Laredo to start with - which is really good. This is one of those starters that I can't pass up whenever I'm here.   I really liked the carne asada I had here for lunch last time, so it was really difficult for me to skip it this time for something new.   Put in an order for Camaron Poblano Asada. This is a poblano peppers stuffed with cheese, onions and a few shrimp, with a skirt steak draped over the top and coated in chimichurri sauce. I have to be honest here - this was not what I was expecting. The flavors fell a little flat for me. The steak was cooked perfectly, but I felt like it wasn't seasoned enough (or the chimichurri sauce was missing something).  On a positive note, I tried a little of my wife's Camarones Escondidos - and I think I may have found a new favorite dish here. The grilled chicken was really tender and the chipotle-wine sauce was amazing!  As usual, service here was great. We had no reservations but were still seated within ten minutes, despite the fact that they were pretty busy.   A shout out to our server, Danielle, who did a great job of taking care of us - good job!  We'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are regular clients during the weekends, their happy hour is fantastic!!   We always have a good service, the food is good and the bartender Eduardo is super attentive to all the customer and give everyone a great experience!   We recommend this place 100%"}
{"text":"It was fine, I'd give it 3.5 stars and I'd go back. Food portions were generous. Service good. Doesn't get more stars because nothing outstanding about it vs other places."}
{"text":"Looks beautiful inside the restaurant. GM very friendly and service oriented but no one else was.   Food super spicy with no warning, hard to find my server when needed more water or the check"}
{"text":"Regular family stop.  The best dish is the Sea Bass by far.  We love the chips and salsa.  I love the fact that they have Tecate in the fridge. Guacamole is sweet mostly because you get to build it yourself.  Kids love the cheese dip as well (whatever its called)."}
{"text":"Just wish I liked this place. Have been here twice (always try to give a place a second chance.) The atmosphere is nice and it's close to home. Service is ok, but food was just so-so, and definitely not worth the price. Maybe it's the way cilantro overpowers all the dishes we've tried, but the food was pretty one-note. The chips and salsa were the reason for the second star. Very nice, which makes it such a shame that the food is sub par.  Doubt I'd be back except maybe for drinks, chips & salsa."}
{"text":"I prefer to sit at the hi-tops by the bar instead of the dining room tables here during the day, and on the patio on a nice night. I always order the same thing and love it -the Enchiladas VeraCruz, with a side of sour cream (adds to the taste.) Love the complimentary chips & their warm salsa as well. This is not typical Mexican food, it's more of a fresh-mex."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here often for happy hour and love it! I find the prices very reasonable for HH. The bartender makes good margaritas and the Taqueria's are plenty for a meal for me - at $6 - that's a great deal! I love that the chips are served warm and thin! The table side guacamole is pricey but good! We've never been disappointed and the tequila dinners that they do are amazing! The tequila is flowing all evening and very accommodating to food allergies"}
{"text":"Although Cantina Laredo books itself as \"gourmet Mexican\", it really serves mainly the usual staples - enchiladas or tacos with rice and beans, etc.  So why the \"gourmet\"?  Maybe it's because the portions are a little smaller or the prices a little higher than your neighborhood favorites.  So how come the four stars?  It's mainly because the food is a cut above the ordinary.  The tacos had so much meat that they were really a handful; even the salsa with the perfect thin crispy chips was different -- a tasty tomatillo salsa if I'm not mistaken.  The chicken enchilada was full of flavor but the beef enchilada was just overly hot (almost inedible).  Cantina Laredo likes to serve its entrees on plates that are just barely big enough to hold the food.  This makes it feel like you are getting small plates although actually the portions are quite filling.  Maybe that's why I probably won't go back - it's just a feeling I get when eating here.  The ambiance, service and the cuisine don't quite match up and it makes me uneasy.  In the final analysis, we often return to restaurants just because they feel right, and for me Cantina Laredo doesn't make the grade.  But you might react differently -- worth a try."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican food restaurants. Love the chicken fajitas and table side guacamole. The desserts make the place smell so good everyone looks up when they cook one! One of my regular spots to enjoy a nice meal."}
{"text":"I was in here with my sister a couple of weeks ago, we were looking for someplace we hadn't tried, and this really hit the spot.  You get two different types of salsa, one warm with blended beans in the background (but still very clearly a salsa and not a bean dip) and the other fresh and cool to start, both of which were good although I preferred the warm dip.  My sister got the shrimp flautas and she really liked them, I didn't try them as I am not a fan of shrimp and cheese generally (alfredo sauce not withstanding).  I got the trio of enchilads with mole, ranchera spinach, and Veracruz.  The ranchera spinach was fresh tasting, but didn't have too much flavor; the mole was good, but the sauce needed to simmer longer to help smooth out the flavors, and the Veracruz style with a tomatillo sauce and cotija cheese was excellent, with gooey cheese and nice chunks of chicken and plenty of spinach, all rolled in what seemed to be a housemade fresh corn tortilla: all this, plus soft drinks and 20+ percent tip for only $18 a piece: can't be beat for the price in the area!  Only minor detraction was our waitress, while properly attentive, did not really speak English and was somehow unable to split the bill into 2 equal checks"}
{"text":"It was OK.  A bit pricey and the food was just average.  The beer wasn't very cold.  The service was nice enough but nothing special.  With so many dining options yet to try out, it will be a while before I go here again."}
{"text":"Went to Cantina Laredo for the first time on Friday night. We went pretty late in the evening...around 8:30-9 o'clock, as the restaurant did not close until 11 that night. There were only about 3 other parties in the entire restaurant besides us. We were seated and drink orders were taken immediately, followed by chips and salsa shortly after. However, we were never given side plates, silverware, or napkins! I asked for napkins/silverware and was told that it would take a few minutes to get those to me. While waiting nearly 5-10 minutes for a napkin, I saw another employee cleaning and setting empty tables with silverware and plates... We finally got ours and we're able to dine on appetizers and chips. Once we were ready to order, our waiter was nowhere in sight for quite a while. We waited 30 minutes before we were able to order. Our waiter was nice, but not very on top of things. Once our food came out it tasted great and we were happy!"}
{"text":"The food was great, I had the enchilada veracruz which was full of flavor, wife had the enchiladas DE avacado which she claims were to die for, but she scarf fed them down so fast I didn't get a taste.  Was however a tad pricey, but over all good."}
{"text":"An upscale, 'Gourmet Mexican' restaurant with a very comfortable atmosphere - dressy but not 'snooty'.  For the Tequila drinker, they have a very well stocked bar with many premium Tequilas.   We found service to be very personable, our server was very friendly taking the time to make sure we understood the menu items and made good conversation while making some  of their 'top shelf' guacamole table side.   Gourmet Mexican is a good description, if your looking for an overstuffed burrito soaking in a bowl of melted cheese and refried beans, go somewhere else. Our dishes were very flavorful and nicely presented. My wife enjoyed her Carnitas so much she never bothered with the accompanying tortillas.  Prices were reasonable for this level of cuisine.   Having moved down South several years ago, our favorite Mexican restaurant, Rancho Tia Rosas, in Mesa is a bit of a drive now, so we were glad to find Cantina Loredo so close to home. Will it replace Tia Rosas as our favorite, no, but it is a worthy alternative close by."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Mexican food so we decided to try this place out. I felt like it was a little over priced for what you get. The chips and salsa is really good and so are the margaritas. I got the crab enchiladas and they were ok. I could of gone without all the extras they put on the plate to \"dress\" it up.   This place is ok. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone wanting really good Mexican food though."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to chill out with a friend because their tableside guacamole and endless chips and salsa are to die for. The chips are paper thin and served warm with 2 types of salsa. Everything I have ordered here has been top notch from typical fajitas (love the baco wrapped shrimp), flautas, tacos, skirt steak wrapped around a poblano chile and of course the exceptional mole enchiladas which you should not skip out on.   Prices here vary depending on what you order. But everything is very well excecuted."}
{"text":"I have dined here before, while on vacationing and always had a good experience. This time, was just okay. I came here on a Sunday evening and the service was pretty slow. I actually had to get up to pour my own water, since the server went MIA for 10 minutes.  The table side guacamole was delicious and the salsa's were good.  I ordered spinach enchiladas and the inside tasted great! The shell tasted stale or something.  The doors and windows were closed and there were a few birds flying around. Not something I would normally care about, if the windows were open , but I kept thinking that they were going to drop poop in my food.  Overall, I think the service needs to improve, because the other few times I had been there things had been much better."}
{"text":"Not good at all. Staff were helpful, food was horrible. How can you mess up beans?"}
{"text":"I've always seen Cantina Laredo but never had the chance to visit until tonight. Walking in on a rainy night not sure what to expect but it didn't look like a Mexican Restaurant. It looked like a modern western theme restaurant. Very clean looking.   Anyways, sat down at our table and before we could breathe they bought us our chips and salsa. He even explained which one was mild and spicy. Very nice. By the time we turned around then our waiter was there to greet us with water cups and asking for our drink orders. Really nice for a change.   I ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos. Came with three tacos, rice and black beans. I got the chipotle sauce on the side. Really spicy and glad it was on the side. Tacos were very good but small. The rice didn't have lots of taste and the black beans were pretty good.   My wife had the chicken tacos. This also came with three taco, rice and black beans. She wasn't a fan of her meal. The chicken was pretty dry but okay.  My son had the fajitas tres which came with beef, chicken, and bacon wrapped shrimp. I tried the beef and it was insanely tender and tasty. The chicken was nice and moist with a pretty good taste. Didn't get to taste the bacon wrapped shrimp cause he gobbled them up. He really enjoyed his fajitas. Very good and tasty.   The chips were so good. Light and not to greasy. We could tell they were freshly made. As I said before, the service was great. Always filling up our glasses and the serve filled up our chips basket when it was empty. Our server was friendly and helpful.   So we had a good meal. Great service, good to ok food with a nice ambiance. My wife even said this wasn't a typical Mexican restaurant cause the food wasn't greasy at all. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Dude.  I am so bummed.  This is pretty much my most favorite restaurant in Dallas and I was SO excited to find that there is one here.  Sadly, it's not the same and the standards are definitely completely different.  I ordered my favorite dish - the enchiladas veracruz - and they came out a bit sub standard.  You see, Cantina Laredo originated in Dallas and in the Park Cities, it's ace.  They are ON it.  The manager always comes by your table to check on you, the service is impeccable, the food is fresh, crisp, and amazing.  In Scottsdale, it was slimy - the sauteed veggies came out mushy and deluged in oil, not sauteed to perfection.  The rice tasted like it had been under a warmer for a while and in Dallas, that is a serious no-no.    I passed up on some other choices to eat here and I wish I hadn't.  Who knows what else I might have discovered.  Oh well...."}
{"text":"This place is tailored more for the Midwestern palette. However, the bartenders are awesome! Food... Well if you grew up in the southwest it's disappointing. If you hate heat and bold flavor... It may be your new favorite."}
{"text":"The food:   - Chips and salsa were excellent.  More than excellent. - The ceviche was pretty good. - The catch of the day (why the hell do I keep ordering the catch of the day in Arizona???  It's a habit from SF and Seattle, I know, but I must not forget that I am in Arizona and the catch of the day is at best, several days old.) was ok.  The preparation (jalapenos, white wine, and butter) sounded enticing, but the sea bass just wasn't fresh enough and it showed. - The tortilla soup was terrible. - The fajitas were good, but not $20 good.  The prices: I don't mind paying for good food.  I do mind paying for mediocre food.  This is mediocre food (aside from the chips!).    Will I be returning?  Unfortunately, yes.  I don't have many Mexican options in the corn fields next to my home and the next closest place, Serrano's is truly terrible."}
{"text":"This story doesn't start out great, but it ends really well, so I have to give them 5 stars. Sick and unable to cook or drive, I ordered food for my son I from Cantina Laredo through Postmates. An hour after I placed the order, I get a knock on the door and take the food. Upon opening it, I discover that it isn't my order! Making matters worse, there was nothing in the bag that we could eat, due to a dairy allergy.  So I call the restaurant. Thirty minutes, and a very angry me later, I spoke with the manager, Mickey. I was so upset at this point, especially because of the thirty minutes on the phone. What I didn't realize, until I spoke with Mickey, is that while I was on hold, they were trying every way they could to figure out what happened, including contacting Postmates to get another driver, unsuccessfully (during dinner rush on a Saturday). It turns out, the order from Postmates never made it to the restaurant, so the driver just walked in and picked up somebody else's order (without verifying what was in the bag) and left. Obviously, this was not the restaurant's fault.  I just wanted my food delivered to me as fast as possible, but since they couldn't get a hold of Postmates and the restaurant does not have it's own delivery service, that was looking like it wasn't going to happen. Again, I was upset by this, but said fine, just refund my card. Of course I was also thinking, and I won't order from here again.  But when I talked to Mickey and he realized what had happened, and that I was sick and unable to drive, he decided to get me my food however he could. I told him what I had ordered, but I did have to change one thing because it was something that wasn't even on their menu anymore, again Postmates fault. He asked if there was anything else he could add to the order, free of charge, which I thought was super nice. I declined anything extra though, because all I really wanted the whole time was the food we ordered. Still, I appreciate the gesture.  A shockingly fast 20 minutes later, Mickey was at my door with my food. This is during the 7 o'clock hour on a Saturday. I'm sure they were slammed.  The food was excellent. I got chicken enchiladas with verde sauce and my son got tacos. The verde sauce was delicious. It has a spicy kick, but not overwhelmingly so. Their salsa is also incredible. One of my favorite salsas. I'm not sure why a lot of people slam their food. I think it's fantastic. It's not traditional, so expect something with a twist, and you shouldn't be disappointed.  I've ordered from here before though, so I know I like the food. But the way Mickey went way above and beyond to fix this situation for me was just astounding. I'm not sure any other restaurant would have done that. If they don't have delivery drivers, they don't have them. Even though I had resigned myself to not eating dinner and warming up some leftover pizza for my son, I was very happy that we got to eat the warm, fresh, delicious Mexican food that we had decided we wanted.   Thank you, Mickey. You almost lost a customer through no fault of your own, but because of your actions, I will probably be a pain in your butt in the future ;)"}
{"text":"The chips were out of this world. While I did enjoy everything, I'd go back just for those chips. Delicious margarita; had the carne asada - very tender and flavorful. Good service. Reasonably priced. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Holy happy hour! Best beef quesadilla north of Hermosillo!  Seriously.  And the \"house\" margarita is better than most top shelf margaritas.  We think the reviews are so low because people don't want you to steal their seat at the bar.  Rolando is a great bartender.  Super friendly and makes an amazing table side guacamole.  Please don't go so I can keep my spot at the bar!"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were fine. Drinks....fine I guess. Food...bland as can be. Absolutely zero flavor or spice. Enchiladas tasted like a budget gourmet frozen dinner. Not many options on menu either in my opinion. Skip this place!"}
{"text":"They have a great happy hour but the best part of this Is their chips and salsa.  Bartenders are very friendly."}
{"text":"Really Great experience. My boyfriend and I came in at 9 on a Saturday night and it was really quite. We made a reservation but didn't need one. We were sat promptly with hot fresh tortilla chips and two in house salsas. One was hot and one cold. We both got enchiladas. The Veracruz and Chicken Poblano. We finished off with the Mexican Apple pie and cinnamon ice-cream. Service was fast and friendly. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Had our rehearsal dinner here. Everyone was fantastic! The staff and servers were great! The food was amazing! We had the outdoor patio for our party which was excellent! No complaints at all."}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo Mexican Restaurant (3Stars)  - 4 Stars for its good valued happy hour drinks & bar dishes and atteactive modern decor - 2 Stars for poor bartender service!  It is a great addition to the charming Tivoli Village. It's a mid-upscale, Mexican restaurant with a plush, modern decor and very inviting, comfortable ambience. Its Happy Hour offer is excellent with good bar dishes and drinks and low prices. Service at the bar is quite SUBPAR, however.  My HH EXPERIENCE:  - My first HH experience here was good enough that I'd go back there again and soon, and bring some friends along.   Its entrance looks upscale and inviting, with the large open patio on the side, its lit firepit radiating warmth and charm. Inside the entrance is a nice waiting area. I was surprised to see a modern, mid-upscale decor - nothing resembles a traditional Mexican establishment!  - It was only after I saw the HH menu and well after getting my free tortilla chips, when Cantina Laredo made me feel being in a Mexican restaurant.  - I took a seat at the bar counter, which was about half-full around 6pm, and had to wait unusually long to get my 1st beer and chips! After one of the 2 barkeeps first greeted me, then they just seemed to ignore the customers.  The bar lounge is medium sized with an attractive bar counter and  several nice bar tables. Its happy hour (4-7; 9-closing M-F: Sat 11-5pm) offers a good selection of drinks ($2-5, plus daily drink specials), half-off bar dishes ($5-7), with free, warm tortilla chips! [- See pics of menu]  I enjoyed my draft Dos XX ($3) and a delicious Margarita (Monday Special, $5, equivalent to two normal margaritas at $3each). For food, I had its popular Crab Cakes ($5.5) which came with 3 pieces - great price. However, the first cake I tasted was disappointing, a bit loose, runny, hardly had any crab meat, and was ONLY LUKE WARM (despite the warning from the server that the plate was super HOT!). After several attempts, I finally got the attention of the bartender, who called the manager. The manager was very friendly and offered to get me another order. I asked him to just have it warmed up, which he did. After the dish was warmed up, the crab cakes did taste much better; those remaining two did contain some crab meat! The mgr explained that the batch was probably not mixed well enough for more even distribution of ingredients? The gentleman sitting next to me was going to order the crab cakes but changed his mind after seeing my order.  Actually my main disappointment was its two bartenders' SUBPAR service that evening. They were NOT attentive, even the bar was not busy. They avoided eye contact with customers. The gentleman next to me and I were sitting at a great spot near the beer tabs and cash register, but we both still had great difficulty getting their attention even for our 1st drink, not to mention our subsquent orders...!  Note to Management: - I understand that your nice restaurant is still brand new. I do hope your management would conduct more training to improve (1) the services at the bar counter, and (2) the consistency/quality of its dishes. PLEASE!  IN SHORT:  - For its elgant, modern decor, nice ambience, and especially its good happy hour menu and low price, I like Cantina Laredo's HH, and will go back. Hopefully, its service at the bar will get better. When it does, I'll include it in my list of favorite bars.  Peterskis, Dec 2012 --"}
{"text":"As part of our effort to get out and around to different parts of this fabulous town we have now lived in for eight months, we ventured over to Tivoli Village to check out the area. When there we saw a couple neat places to eat, but we decided Cantina Laredo looked like a cool place to take the family. We came in and sat on the patio outside. It was a beautiful night and Tivoli Village is a cool place to look at, so the patio is a plus to this place. Alexandria voted on us and did a fantastic job. She knew the menu very well and helped us select our entrees. They have a good kids menu with great pricing. We had their Chille Con Queso dip as an appetizer along with there chips and salsa. I had the Mahi Mahi tacos with black beans and rice. The tacos were phenomenal, I had no choice, but to clean my plate of them. The black beans were also good. The only complaint I had was the rice which was okay, but had a lime flavor that was a little overwhelming. But, overall really good. My wife had the Chicken Quesadilla for her meal and enjoyed it. We wanted to try the Mexican Apple Pie which looks amazing, but we were too full. Oh well...maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Seriously.....best margaritas EVER!!! And the food is delicious as well!!! Started with the chips and warm and cold salsa ....had the best taco costillas ....my husband had the taco de fajitas ....yummy!!! Had tequila shots the day before ....as well as their Cabo Wabo flip...inverted lime with an extra shot of tequila.....ask for Jenna if you want a table....or Mike at the bar!!!  Mike is extremely knowledgeable and really knows his business ....."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to have dinner here. I went to the bathroom while he put our name in.   He texted me telling me a table for two would be 30-35 minutes. As I was walking to meet him , a gentleman walked up and was told he could be sat right away for a table for two.   The difference between the gentleman I saw and my husband ?  My husband is wearing a pressed $350 business suit and tie. The gentleman causal jeans and tee shirt.   The major difference to the hostess ? My husband is pacific island. The gentleman was white.    It gets better, I am pale redhead and I asked how long for a table for two? I am dressed formal also. She looks at me and tells me 5-10 minutes.   Then as I was leaving , an African American gentleman walked in  and ask \"hey how long for one of those tables outside? For two\", the hostess reply \"For you 30-35 minutes\".  I have attached a photo of all the empty tables that were to good for someone of color to sit at in there photos.   It shouldn't matter what we were wearing, this restaurant doesn't have a dress code. It shouldn't matter what color our skin is as our money spends as well as someone else. I encourage no one to spend their money here."}
{"text":"As a continuation of a Saturday afternoon drink/food fest, we decided to drive a quick 5 minutes away and visit Cantina Laredo in Tivoli Village.  To our surprise, they had a happy hour going on.  Please be advised that it is only in the bar.  For the happy hour, the margaritas were half off and so were the beers.  I just got a Pacifico but it was cheap!  Our tables decided to get a bunch of different appetizers.  Oh, I almost forgot!  If you check in on Foursquare (after checking into Yelp of course!), your table will get a free queso!  What I really love is the unlimited chips and salsa that the staff brings to your table.  I was very appreciative of that.  The chili con queso (usually $7.85) was a little runny but the flavor was awesome!  It came in a soup bowl and fed us for a long time!  Try taking the tortilla chips and dipping it into that.  It's total bomb diggity :)  Our table also got a few chicken and pork tacos, as well as chicken fajitas nachos al carbon for $10.  It was a full plate of the chicken, melted cheese peppers and goodness!  The chicken tacos or Taco De Pollo for $9.45 was Fajita chicken with avocado, pico de gallo, queso fresco and poblano drizzle.  It was packed with a lot of flavor!  Avocado is creamy and chunky and the pico de gallo offers a light taste with fresh ingredients.  The Tacos De Carnitas for $10.05 includes Slow-roasted pork with chipotle wine sauce.  I love slow roasted shredded pork.  So much flavor.  So much juice.  On point!  All in all, this place was a great time!  Since the outside area is so inviting and close to the bar, I would maybe suggest to extend the happy hour to that area.  That would make this place perfect!  No matter, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Lisa took care of us and was extremely pleasant :) Our food was excellent as well. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We only go for brunch on weekends, so I can't talk about the service since we always get great service.  The fajitas are excellent(get grilled jalapeno's on the side) but my favorite is the Sunday brunch with eggs, steak & potatoes with the awesome chimachurri sauce.  I order a side of their chimachurri sauce every time we go regardless of what I order.  The shrimp dishes are quite good too.  The classic taco/enchilada plates are average.  The down side are the chips & salsa.  The chips are hit & miss, sometimes warm sometime cold.  The red salsa is too mild for us but has a decent taste, the other salsa they serve,  I cant even stand the smell of it, but maybe thats just me. On a plus, it has big screen tv's for sports on the weekends and its clean as could be."}
{"text":"Just finished a productive and delicious working lunch at Cantina Laredo at Tivoli Village. The salmon chimichurri lunch special and service were  fantastic.   I took note of the Thursday night lady's night with half price Margaritas. They have some unique and creative twists on traditional margaritas. Yum!   Free Wi-Fi makes it a great place for business. Big thanks to the day manager that really went above and beyond in gracious service."}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo is an upscale Mexican restaurant located in North Scottsdale.  They have a great bar selection, and their huge margaritas are great.  If you order the guacamole, they make it fresh right at your table, and it's really, really good!  My favorite has to be the skillet brownie dessert though.  It's amazing, but extremely hot as it's served in an actual skillet.  Trust me, it's worth any minor burns."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Reminds me of being back home in Yuma"}
{"text":"Nothing exceptional, yet no terrible disappointments. An Abuelos clone for sure. Don't go outta your way."}
{"text":"I've come back a few times and it's always a great experience. Best margaritas and staff."}
{"text":"We saw all of the pictures and thought \"This place can't have 3 stars...the food looks super good!\". So, we tried it out. And sadly, it was 3 stars if not 2 1/2. It's just your typical Americanized Mexican joint that needs so much more spice and flavor.   I don't need to write much as there are numerous reviews already.  The food was okay. It looks much prettier in the pics.   We ordered a decent amount of food. Worst thing I always hate about restaurants - they used pre-cooked rice. Rice is pretty cheap, people. And pre-cooked rice is disgusting.   Biggest downer - when you go to try a new place and spend over $100 and the food is not that great. Time and money you can't get back.   The service was excellent and the restaurant is pretty. But if you're going to try the food, it's \"merh\" at best."}
{"text":"Decor and food very boring. No ambience could have been any restaurant anywhere."}
{"text":"A cool Mexican spot in Tivoli village that feature great margarita, appetizer and entrees!   I really enjoyed the table side guacamole, made fresh and at the spice level you like. The Cadillac margarita was crisp, tart and refreshing! - me being a big fan of margaritas, I'm always on the hunt for the best one!   The Carne Asada was delicious and the price point was extremely reasonable. If you're in the area and are craving Mexican food, give this place a chance! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Everything was really tasty here. The salsa brought with the chips was really flavorful. We're fans of hole-in-the-wall Mexican places usually...but we were surprised by this more upscale Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Again, I'm giving credit where credit it due.  While I'm still not thrilled with the visit to Cantina Laredo Saturday night, I have to give kudos to Dave the manager (long time with the chain) for calling and following up. He showed a REAL concern for any problems that guests might have and wanted to make it right and will follow up on my complaints.  Caring about customers is more than half the battle in retaining people who spend their hard earned money with you. Thanks for the follow up and we'll see how things go should I visit again...which I might."}
{"text":"I saw the reviews for this place and decided to try it. The food was awesome and the service was really good. We ate outside next to the fire and had a really good waiter. The chips and salsa were really good. I would totally recommend it to anyone. I really loved the chile relleno and margarittas. Great food. Great atmosphere. Fun place to hang."}
{"text":"WOW, what a hidden gem. I probably walked pass the place a bajillion times and never tried it. Now, I hate myself. lol  Great menu with great employees like our server Jose and the restaurant manager Mark.   We ordered several items; gaucamole(which was prepared at table side), Fish and Shrimp Tacos, ahhhhmazing!!! i loved the fish tacos more than the shrimp and also ordered the Daily Special which was Chilean Seabass omg to. die. for. So succulent and doused in this yummy sauce omg i want some right now just thinking about it!  Cant wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today while car shopping & would happily come back. The inside is clean & bright, there's a nice patio area.  Food would be fairly priced if the portions could be a bit bigger. We had enchiladas and both kinds were really good, albeit very skinny and really didn't seem to have much filling at all inside. The rice & beans sides were good- they came with different kinds (refried vs. black and different rices; I'm not sure why, but they were both tasty).  The service here was outstanding. A food runner/busser brought chips & salsa within 5 minutes of sitting down, and wished my mom happy Mothers Day. Our food came out quickly. The manager came by to check on us, which is always nice.  Lavonte was very attentive and efficient. He totally went above & beyond too - when my mom asked for a glass of water to pour into her makeshift travel cup (read: empty Starbucks cup), he actually took her cup in the back & filled it up with ice water himself. That was super cool of him."}
{"text":"Ok food, but horrible service had to ask several times for water. Waitress never checked back in to see how the meal was. It took her three trips to finally ask if we were ready to order etc... Would not recommend and wished I read the other reviews first. They all say the same thing about service. Total bummer because the space is pretty."}
{"text":"Homemade guacamole is great...needed a little kick or more salt this time but good as usual. Steak fajitas are so amazing!!!  I'm not even a huge fan of steak but whatever they season it with is definitely working. Rice is boring and beans were nasty but the fajita makes up for it!!!"}
{"text":"When this first opened the food was good. Now it tastes like everything came from the freezer. The food is just okay now but not for the price."}
{"text":"This was not good- at all. The best part about the meal were the chips and salsa. The salsa was really fresh and flavorful. The food was beyond disappointing. The beans were dry, the rice tasted like it was made from a packet! As far as the taco, I could have ordered this at Taco Bell. What kind of a Mexican restaurant serves these kinds of shells??? Luckily we went during lunch so we ended up paying around $10 for this instead of probably $15 for."}
{"text":"We came here for Cinco de Mayo this year, all first timers, and had a great experience.  We were a small party of 3 and had asked to be seated outside. We waited for quite some time. A server had gone to a table on one side of us, looked me in the eyes, and walked right around our table to another group. That happened about 3 times and we noticed a couple had just left the small bar area that's seated right outside but faces the inside of the bar- super neat. So we moved and were taken care of by Lillian.   She gave us the menu, which was happy hour pricing all day and also had a special margarita with 5 tequilas. We each ordered one- AMAZING. I loved that it was sour and not so sweet! I hate that. No salt on mine- no problem. I ordered the ahi tacos with my sauce on the side, an order of guac for us to share and the guys got the barbacoa. Everything was great. It's hard to beat the amount of food for the price. The guac was made right in front of us- just like at other Mexican eateries. I always appreciate a fresh, chunky bowl of guac AND when given the option of spice level.   We will be back for happy hour or their reverse happy hour and I'll definitely ask for Lillian- you should too!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has sure changed from when we were here a year ago.  Margarita's using a different recipe - yuk.  Service was disorganized and slow.  Meal was not anywhere near as good as our last visit.  We'll look elsewhere when we come back to Scottsdale next year."}
{"text":"The actual food was great. The presentation was thoughtful. The guacamole was bland and salsas could have been better. The chips suck! (I like them thick, crispy and with a little flavor). But overall for the happy hour price it was on point. It didn't take long for the food to come and it was all correct.  The server and staff were friendly and seemed to enjoy their job. Although he did say he did not receive benefits.   We ate outside since we had our dogs with us, but I did go inside and check it out. The setting was nice, and tables and booths were not on top of each other. I really like that! The  restaurant and women's' restroom was clean, however some things seemed to be poorly organized for them not being very busy.   I would definitely revisit. I think it's a great place for a date, nice night out or daytime."}
{"text":"I had beef fajitas (so original of me) and my wife went with a crab dish (something new on the menu).   Food was great as always.  The atmosphere was good and full of great energy.   When we checked in we were told we would be seated in 10 mins.   We left our names and hopped on 2 bar stools to scarf some hand made Guac while we waited. My first question to the bartender was \"will the hostess find us here\" (this based on the fact hay they don't have the little light up vibrating \"it's your turn to sit toys).  He said absolutely.   After realizing way more than 10 mins had passed I went up to the stand and asked \"are we up?\"  The hostess said \"you are next.\"  I said \"so you skipped us.\"  She then reluctantly admitted yes we called you and you didn't come.  That is about the only negative to our night at cantina.  Great place to get some Mexican food!"}
{"text":"We came here on Cinco de Drinko and had a good time! The decor/vibe is very nice, but overall our experience was just o-kay, nothing spectacular. There was a DJ dropping some Latin tunes, though, which was cool.   The waiters didn't seem to know what was going on haha, albeit annoying, it was almost comical. Our patio table was super wobbly so we had to stuff napkins under it. The patio mister's water was getting caught on their hanging flags and spewing large water droplets all over the place creating quite a puddle. Rather than fix it, people just couldn't sit there. The food was good, nothing spesh. Kind of pricey, too.  It also seemed that they had some regular specials on Thursday's that weren't going on because of Cinco de Mayo, which is kind of backwards.  It wasn't memorable for me and isn't somewhere I'd rave about, but If I'm in the mood for Mexican again I'll give them another shot. Ole!"}
{"text":"Very bland food. Really dry and flavorless shredded chicken in the enchiladas. Very flavorless dressing on the cilantro salad. The exception was the tableside guacamole. That was very good."}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo has a great happy hour, and some great drinks.  The cheesy/meat dip on the happy hour menu is dangerously good.  I also had some fancy mojitos that were also super bomb.  I'm pretty picky when it comes to Salsa, and theirs is great."}
{"text":"Today was my first time here and the place was great.  The Sangria was amazing!!!   Had the carnita tacos that were great in flavor.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Where do I begin?  This place has excellent food, great happy hour, and most importantly an amazing staff. Happy hour runs until 7pm during the week. Sunday's carne asada brunch is AMAZING!  Not to mention is comes with a complementary Bloody Mary.  The food, drinks, and staff keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"Underwhelming Mexican food experience. Chips and salsa were actually very good, but main courses we had were kind of bland and not very tasty."}
{"text":"Good food, and good, but pricey drinks in a very nice atmosphere with attentive service. The guacamole was yummy."}
{"text":"One star reviews are rare for me. This experience was horrible all around. It took 15 minutes to get a drink. I started to wonder if anyone was even working there after that amount of time. I ordered from the happy hour menu. The food arrived and it was incorrect. They eventually brought out the correct item. The side fries were caked in black pepper. The final bill was more expensive than the happy hour advertised online. Bummer."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I frequent this place at least twice a month for Sunday brunch. The service is great. One recommendation is I clarify with the waiter if the whole menu is considered brunch, or just the too menu items. I say this because our first few times we were told the whole menu is considered brunch and this comes with a complimentary alcoholic beverage.  I tell all my friends about this place and we have brought many to dine there as well. Without a doubt, one of my favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing , our waiter Dan was the best!!! Definitely coming here more often!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. We were meeting friends that had made reservations.  When we arrived, the hostess said she'd already seated them and we were free to walk around and try to find them.  Really?   We awkwardly walked around the entire restaurant looking at people, until we found them.  I ordered a margarita with no salt.  It had salt.   Our friend had a whiskey and diet coke.  The drink was clear in color.  The waitress said they must have run out of syrup.  So, she brought him a new diet coke on the side.  I was really looking forward to the fresh guacamole, made at the table.  It was fresh, but without flavor, and we had it made with the works.  I ordered the chicken enchiladas.  They were extremely bland  No onion, garlic, cheese....just a white sauce with something green drizzled on top.  My husband had the fish taco's.  He said if it had just been the two of us, he would have sent them back.  He didn't want to make a scene, but said the fish tasted old.    We also requested extra salsa, as we'd consumed every drop, trying to get some flavor.  It never came.  The waitress was very pleasant, but for the prices and flavor, very disappointing.  Filiberto's is much better!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food with an inspired twist. It's been awhile since I visited, but I do remember enjoying myself and that the service was above par. Classy date-worthy atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Not my favorite Mexican restaurant.  While the salsas are tasty, I wasn't impressed with the rest of the food. Flour tortilla is far too thick and chewy and nothing else besides meat. There are many different options available,  this will go to the bottom of my list"}
{"text":"Came here for my girl's birthday and we were surprised that we didn't enjoy our food as much as we did at the Gilbert location. Service was ok (waiter accidentally spilled beer on my future father in law). Flan definitely wasn't as good as the Gilbert store's."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place from Texas.  Saw this place at the Houston airport last time I was in Texas and decided to give it a try in Scottsdale.  The food overall was decent, but nothing spectacular.  Ambiance is nice, however if you like Tex-Mex you need to give Abuelo's in Chandler a try.  Way better food and is similarly priced."}
{"text":"I had lunch with my parents here just yesterday and it was an awful dining experience. I used to be a fan but it's been quite a while since the last time I came to a Cantina Laredo. It was about 12:30pm, not very busy but I sat and waited (my parents weren't there yet) to be helped since there was no hostess when I walked in. I sat for 10 minutes before anyone came by to seat me. And yes, I saw at least 2 people look my way. That already rubbed me the wrong way. The food was also lackluster. The table side gauc was bland and lacked salt, however, the \"spicy\" and medium salsa were too salty. My dad told our waitress that the spicy salsa was not spicy and that it was too salty and she just laughs and says \"ok, I'll be right back\". A warm salsa is brought over and I was thinking, isn't this the same crap? Like warming it up is going to change the saltiness. Then when she takes our orders, I asked how many shrimp came with the shrimp salad. She answers \"5\" so I said yes, as that is what determined my answer. We get our food and after I ate the first shrimp I combed the salad to count the rest and there were only 3 left. I let her know when she came back around but instead of an apology she says \"my bad, I'll get you another one\" without making eye contact and swiftly turns the other direction. I had to go shortly after because I had to get back to work so my parents told me they ended up eating the 1 shrimp they brought back. It pisses me off that they charge $14 + for 4 pieces of average sized shrimp in limp leaf salad. Throwing in extra chunks of canned or leftover pineapple doesn't make up for how overpriced it is. That's all I could think about while I was eating it. If I didn't have to go back to work I would have talked to the manager. It's so annoying to deal with impolite staff on top of below-average food."}
{"text":"Love their happy hour. Great food and drink specials. The chicken tacos are a favorite of ours and their margaritas can't be beat."}
{"text":"Seriously, what is with the crappy reviews. It's not pricey. Especially if you go on happy hour which is 4-7pm and 9pm-close 1/2 half apps and good $3 margaritas and $4 house wines and well drinks. $2 beers. Now this is probably the best mexican restaurant in Vegas besides Dos Caminos which I think is closed. They have the most flavorful tacos and outstanding chicken flautas. Last night we had 6 tacos (brisket, spicy chicken, carnitas), chicken flautas, 2 $3 margaritas, FREE GUAC, queso fundido, chips and salsa, and outstanding ceviche (fresh) for happy hour and was $35. We couldn't even finish it all such huge portions. I ordered chicken enchiladas which were the best I ever had and even the rice was good not the beans though and guess what the non happy hour menu price is $9.65. Anyone who thinks Macayo is good is white washed. The restaurant is very nice and modern and clean and our server was absolutely adorable and was extremely friendly. Honestly, give this place a try and trust me you won't regret it just ignore they clueless idiots who dont have a sense when it comes to eating out. Geez!  PROS: Ambiance, price, food, service, area CONS: beans  TIP: stop at valet to get free tableside guacomole coupon"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The food, service, drinks, and just the whole restaurant itself were all GREAT!  I was impressed when I got my margarita that they do not stiff you on the tequila at all.. You definitely get your money's worth lets just put it that way.  Happy hour is the better way to go if you are able to though, as the drinks can get pricey.  The food is also pricey, but good quality and very fresh.  The server my friend and I had was Jackie, and she was amazing.  I will definitely be back, she made our first trip there very welcoming and fun!"}
{"text":"Drinks went down hill and place closed......"}
{"text":"I went there again and had the beef quesadilla. Very different from the first time. There was wayyyy too much cheese and hardly any meat.   The server wasn't friendly either. And the menu's were dirty with other peoples food ect.  This is now a place I wouldn't consider going to."}
{"text":"We used the Door Dash app to order from Cantina Laredo. I am pregnant and was really craving some Mexican food. I have to say I was pretty disappointed :( my husband ordered the chicken enchiladas, with no description we assumed we were getting normal chicken enchiladas but they came with a sour cream sauce, which he's not a fan of so he didn't really get to eat. I ordered one of the combinations. The Cozumel. The Chili Relleno was not cooked as a normal one would be, the chicken enchalada was ok.. and the ground beef enchalada with chili was just weird. The rice was good, but the beans.. ugh how do you screw up refried beans?!?! So much bacon, YUCK!   About the only thing I would go back for is there chips and salsa..   Probably not a place I will go back to..   Also, if your going use an app like Door Dash I highly recommend the restaurant add a good description!"}
{"text":"This place is ok.  Think of it like a Carrabas for Mexican food.  Nothing great... nothing authentic... nothing offensive.  Middle of the road Mexican fare at a reasonable price.  It is acceptable."}
{"text":"My sister and I were out and about and I have been starving. I was ready to pass out, good thing they gave us chips and salsa. I was not hungry for Mexican food since I wasn't feeling well anyway. I just wanted some fries. We ordered quesadillas al cangrejo, asada y enchilada and torta de carnitas.  Chips & Salsa: The chips were warm, thin and crispy. They were awesome. We had 2 dipping sauces: one spicy, one medium spicy. 4/5  Quesadillas al Cangrejo: 3 quesadillas stuffed with lump crab, goat cheese and topped with mango ginger salsa. This was a nightmare on a plate for me since I'm allergic to shellfish and I'm lactose intolerant. Since I was already sick, I had a small bite anyway. The quesadilla itself was nice, soft and fluffy. The goat cheese and mango add tartness to the crab. I wouldn't worry about this dish since they were pulling it off the menu that day. 2/5  Asada y Enchilada: Grilled skirt steak with marinated onions, rice topped with tomatillo sauce. This is something I would somewhat enjoy if I wasn't sick. The steak was pretty tender and flavorful but it's not one of the best asadas I've ever had. 3/5  Torta de Carnitas: Griddle-baked sandwich with slow-roasted pork, apricot spread and chipotle aioli. It comes with a side of fries. Yay, something I could eat! The slow-roasted pork was juicy and very mildly flavored. The apricot spread and chipotle aioli turned me off. I took 1-2 bites and ate some of the fries. 2/5  If you want Gringo Mexican food, this place might work for you. I've had better food and paid less money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Whoa... strong margaritas. That is my main impression when I left. I can seriously appreciate this after a hard day and having gone to other places which charge the same and feel like I just paid for some watered down margarita mix. These? Tasty... effective. Yessssss....  The atmosphere of this place is pretty cozy with it's dim lighting and large booths. Prices were reasonable and the service was friendly. I ordered the Enchiladas de Chile Relleno and while there wasn't anything about them that stood out, they were delicious all the same.  I absolutely plan on going back and trying more off the menu. An update shall come then."}
{"text":"Food is overpriced and a bit bland. It was a busy Saturday night but service was slow. Margherita was too strong; not well made.   Employees are nice and the ambiance is casual and modern.   Won't revisit. Can easily find better food and value elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had the spinach enchilada, and it was delicious!  The service my friends and I received here was also great.  The server was very friendly and attentive.  If I lived in Phoenix, I'd likely be back here.  (Only small complaint: wish they had more for vegetarians!)"}
{"text":"I think the food is pretty good. I love their happy hour and I love their  guacamole."}
{"text":"Excellente'!  Great meal with friends on Easter Sunday.  Amazing margaritas.  Service was fantastico!  Love Cantina.  Great Gilbert destination for food and friends outing!  I love everything about this place e, including the service."}
{"text":"We used to be regulars at the Cantina but hadn't been in for over a month.  On Fri. 9/5 we arrived there at 4:30.  I ordered a Margarita & Mahi Tacos & my partner ordered coffee & a chicken quesadilla.  The Margarita tasted like perfume & was murky so I sent it back (as did the woman next to me).  Our server Jackie (always exceptional) said she'd have one made from scratch.  That came & it was very sweet, so I asked for a Mojito.  That was too sweet, but I didn't want to be a pain in the arss, so sipped part of it & let the matter go.  My Mahi tacos consisted of so many large pieces of red cabbage & I couldn't find any fish in the first two.  But alas!  There were pebbles of fish in the 3rd taco.  By this time I was feeling ripped off-- no decent drink & no edible food.  Jackie asked if I wanted anything else & I said just a small order of cheese dip for the chips; & asked for the Manager.  An assistant arrived at our table & said he'd take care of it, but he disappeared for too long so we asked our server who then inquired.  He told her he'd comp the food but not the drink.  Thanks a lot, Pal !  We left a nice tip for Jackie & that was it.  The lack of friendliness by the receptionist didn't help matters, & because she was close to our table I noticed she treated everyone else the same way-- not even a smile.  Manager & co-owner Mark left for a Cantina in another state recently & under his guidance, it was a different restaurant.  He'd have comped the whole thing & rolled out the carpet, espec. since we've brought so many people in to try that restaurant.  So for now, it's ADIOS!  K I K I"}
{"text":"Been here twice-- First time was okay and second time was a disaster. Service was horrible and the food was terrible. How do you screw up a salad?? Will not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Probably won't be back. Joined for the first time this past weekend for lunch and needless to say I was not impressed. Felt very chainy, the food was decent but nothing memorable. The restaurant itself wasn't lively, the interior was boring and the service was just \"ok\". I have been meaning to try this place for quite some time but this was not what I was expecting! The enchiladas weren't bad and the tableside guacamole was ok but there are so many other places I would go back to before coming back here. Womp womp womp. Which is a total let down because it's so close to my house!"}
{"text":"There really isn't very much great Mexican food here, which doesn't make very much sense to me,as we live in the southwest.  We don't really have much choice, so we frequent here about once a month or so.  The pricing is a little high, but the restaurant is nicer than most Mexican restaurants out there, and the food is decent for North Scottsdale.  I should clarify that we only order 3 things here....EVER.  The tableside guac, and the beef or chicken fajitas, and MARGARITAS! The chicken enchiladas are o-kay, the cream sauce is seriously on the rich and heavy side. Don't order their crunchy tacos, the shell is like something from a grocery store shelf!     We order the beef fajitas medium rare and it is more than enough for two people especially  with the guacamole.  When the server is making the guac, don't let him add the entire 'spice'  mix...if you let him your guac will be a salt lick..unless you like that...  Chips and salsa aren't bad...I'm not super huge into the roasted tomato thing, but nothing is perfect I guess.  Still good.  Maybe one day we will venture away from the fajitas, or then again, maybe not :)"}
{"text":"Of course, coming to visit our aunt/uncle in Arizona, we knew we were gonna have some form of Mexican food. One thing that California is not short on (unlike beautiful public libraries like those we visited in Scottsdale!) is Mexican eateries. So, I was a bit surprised when we pulled up to this obvious chain restaurant, which I didn't know it was because Cantina Laredo has not expanded to CA yet. But, I figured, let's not be judgemental.  We arrived at about 6:30 on a payday-weekend Friday night...just finding a parking space was an adventure, but at least being crowded seemed like a good sign. After being quickly and warmly greeted, we managed to find a spot for the four of us to wait the half-hour until our table was ready. Since it was still Happy Hour, we got some pretty yummy and decently sized margaritas for only $5 each.   The food was great! We got the table-side fresh-made guacamole, prepared by our wonderful server Andrew (big kudos to him for taking care of us in a friendly, courteous, and efficient way all night). Everyone liked their food very much, but I can only speak to my order of carnitas...SO YUMMY! And, I've never had carnitas served on the bone, which was kinda cool.   I saved room for dessert SPECIFICALLY because I saw the Mexican apple pie with cinnamon ice cream. When Andrew brought it out, the plate sizzled when he poured the DELICIOUS and warm brandy/butter sauce onto the plate. Sooo good! Do yourself a favor and save room to try this delectable concoction.   All in all, we had a great first-time experience at Cantina Laredo (thanks to Andrew for helping that along). :)"}
{"text":"Great service.  When it comes to the food there idea of fresh is 4 day old cow shit . Fish tacos tasted like the fish sat out for a week . I have never had fish that tasted so nasty. Had a hard time taking the first bite and there was not a second bite.  We told our waitress that the fish was not of satisfaction and she just chuckled and walked away ."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was great. The tamales are to die for. My main gripe is the parking."}
{"text":"Love Cantina Laredo! Friendly staff, great food, fantastic drinks, and prices are better than their competition. The manager is so friendly and makes sure everything is right. Great outside fire pit!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here the service and food are great. I'm never disappointed and always return here with my girlfriend. They also have a happy hour with fantastic savings."}
{"text":"The food was not edible and service mediocre. I do not suggest this place, you would be better off at a hole in the wall food would taste better. Lastly they do not serve everything they say per entree. No good save your cash!!!! I have traveled the United States and I rank this restaurant one of the worst ones."}
{"text":"A favorite stop for us.  The food is excellent, service outstanding and a great Happy Hour. One of our favorite places to enjoy Sunday Brunch. $2 mimosas and Bloody Mary's all day on Sunday."}
{"text":"This place is a staple for us.  Always great food and good happy for deals.  Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that it is starting to feel dated. Needs a remodel and it would be back on track.  Our service was amazing."}
{"text":"3rd time here = last time here.  The place is usually busy. So, good for them.  Previous trips have been happy experiences even with having to wait upwards of 30 minutes.  This time, not so much. Mole enchilada: when have you ever had an enchilada with no cheese? This one was nearly devoid of the key ingredient. Strange. The mole flavor was just OK. Mahi Mahi tacos: partly my fault - the menu didn't say \"cabbage\" and I didn't ask. I have a food allergy so this was a no go. The server wanted to push back when I commented. Minutes later he'd rethought and offered the same meal with no cabbage. What I got was 3 mini tortillas with small bits of Mahi Mahi and a mayonnaise sauce.   It's just not special enough to put up with any more."}
{"text":"Awesome Food Disappointing Service   The food was a 5 but our server (sitting at bar high top)  although nice was completely inefficient and needing additional training.  More details upon request!"}
{"text":"First visit and was impressed. Love the decor. The service was excellent. The menu is not your typical Tex Mex. There were three salad choices of generous size. We ordered the table prepared guac which was excellent. We ordered it mild and could taste the exquisite flavors. I love roasted salsa and thought it was better than most I have had. I am used to my sister in law's homemade salsa and understand the preparation that is involved. My enchiladas were fresh with lightly sautéed spinach, chicken that is clearly cooked in house, and a very flavorful tomatillo sauce, not too spicy. Loved the side Zucchini in a light butter sauce. I tasted my friend's pinto beans with her fajitas and thought they were just okay.  There are many menu items that I wish to try, so will be back again."}
{"text":"Hostess sat us very quickly and downhill from there. My wife received her drink, 15 minutes later I received my beer. Ordered our meal 20-25 minutes later the food came. Sizzling plates. Then had to call someone to bring silverware. First bite, ice cold mushroom. The sign says \"Gourmet\". What makes it gourmet. Average at best and lousy service. This was a Monday...not that busy. I won't return."}
{"text":"Chain mexican food catering to caucasians.   There are some novel things like making guac table side and good queso  but the entrees isn't really that good at all."}
{"text":"This is my first time here. I've been to San Tan mall a million times but never knew it was here. I was invited to a surprise birthday party here and we got the back room, which is pretty big and slightly secluded from the restaurant.  Although the ambiance is nice, I don't personally think the food was worth the money. The chips weren't really restaurant style; they reminded me of the all-you-can-eat chips at Chili's (not great). There were two different salsas and they were decent.  I paid $5 per taco for 3 fish tacos - grilled mahi mahi. The fish was pretty good, but over all, nothing special for fish tacos. My wife got the Enchiladas Vericruz. She said it was better than she thought it'd be. Good flavor and moist chicken. She liked the healthy grilled cucumbers on the side instead of rice and beans.  Over all, good atmosphere and good service, but I didn't think the quality of food merited the price. Glad we tried it out, but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I had been dying to come back to Cantina Laredo after the outstanding Yelp Gold Elite dinner I attended a little over a month ago.  The plan was to pick up my wife after she got out of work and I went over to Misti's CMYE at La Belle Terre in the meantime.  Unfortunately (or fortunately?) the treats they offered were really, really good and I couldn't bear to eat...just ...one.    So I wasn't that hungry when we rolled in here.  We split an appetizer and entree.  But it looked like happy hour was truly where it was at with half price margaritas, $3 beer and half off the bar menu.  They run that from 4pm-7pm and after 9pm.  Ofcourse we're there at 7:30pm.  We made sure to order things that weren't discounted during happy hour.  Appetizer: My wife's only request is that she wanted something with cheese.  What?  At a Mexican restaurant???  Are you sure???  It didn't get much cheesier than the \"Laredo Fundido\" which was a huge bowl of cheese sauce with taco meat in it.  This would be excellent to share with a group.   I would've preferred the tableside guacamole.  A lot of tables ordered it and that looked great.  Entree: The \"Enchilada Mole\" was pretty good.  Mole isn't something I want to have most of the time but it sounded great and it delivered.  The sauce had good flavor and tasted like only mole could.  I'll definitely be back for some of the more exciting dishes when I have more of an appetite.  The outdoor area will be great when it gets warmer too."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful lunch there today. They had a 3 course meal special going on so I took advantage of it and loved every bite. I started off with a chicken taquito appetiser, had a wonderful steak and enchilada entree and ended with a delicious dessert with strawberries, ice cream and cinnamon chips. The server was great and very attentive. We never wanted for a drink refill or more chips. I will go back to Cantina Laredo soon."}
{"text":"Not good mexican food...authentic? Please! I had the mole enchilada...it was okay. Chips and salsa.....meh...weak salsa. It is pricey....and it really shouldn't be for the portion you get!  The only good thing? The service was excellent but they just need fire the chef and get a good mexican crew back there."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and really good food. Went for happy hour (1/2 priced apps and not sure of the drink specials but the margs were full price and we didn't care for any of them). Great crab cakes, wonderful mango chicken salad with jicama and excellent ceviche but the table side guacamole was standard fare, nothing special. Great bar scene and huge dining room and outdoor patio, will definitely return and just drink wine."}
{"text":"We went here last night for Mother's Day and the only fantastic thing about it was the tableside guacamole.  I had the carnitas which were so spicy I could barely eat one.  The apple pie was so hot that it burned me which I still have a mark.  Diner be warned."}
{"text":"Yesterday was our first time here. We were both pleasantly surprised. Yummy chips and salsa. The food was served beautifully. Presentation is very important to me. I eat mostly \"clean food,\" I was not disappointed. The noise level was low enough that I didn't have to shout or have my husband repeat himself over and over. We walked our after our meals very satisfied and excited that we have found a New to us favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"This was an ok mexican restaurant. This place is more trendy than substance. The waitress got our drink order wrong and then suggested a spicy dish for me, that wasn't all that spicy.  This place is ok, but not great. There are better mexican restaurants in the Valley."}
{"text":"The place exceeded our expectations. The food was wonderful. There were 5 of us who each ordered something different, and we all loved what we got. I ordered tamales and enchiladas. Yum. Prices we're good too!  I recommend Thursday night...1/2 price margaritas for the ladies."}
{"text":"Cantina Laredo has not only some of the best food, but the best service I've ever experienced in Las Vegas!  I love going here for Happy Hour, and Brunch on the weekend. My boyfriend and I always sit at the bar and Eduardo is absolutely amazing"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate a family birthday and had a great time.  We have some good and some bad but the attention from the management that we received was impressive.  We grabbed a couple of drinks at the bar while we waited for the rest of our party and the bar top was not wiped down.  Dirty plates were cleared but globs of salsa were not cleaned up making it difficult to know where to put my hands or my purse.  The house margarita was good but a little on the sweet side for me.  The food was just ok, maybe it just wasn't my jam.  It is more Fresh Mexican vs. Authentic Mexican which some people prefer but I like old school good flavor.  The 2 different salsa were delicious and a nice touch The 2 different salsa were delicious and a nice touch.   We ordered 2 of the guacamole, which was mixed table side and made to your specifications, but they were just ok.  Small portions and the pieces of jalapeno mixed in were a large dice, which sometimes tasted like a giant bite of pepper instead of Guacamole.  Our server was so so, she was helpful but also misguided in a couple areas.  We had some gringo's in the group who do NOT like spice and she suggested any of the enchiladas or a couple of the tacos.  My enchiladas were definitely spicy and were not at all mild (I'll get to them later) and one of our group had to send her dish back it was so spicy.  Another misstep were plates not cleared, waters not refilled, or that I was skipped over for the drink order because I was closing out my tab at the bar when she took the initial water order.  We had a child dining with us and his empty Sprite was never offered a refill and we ended up refilling it with water after it sat empty long enough.  The rest of our party was very happy with their entrees, the hit among everyone was the Camaron Poblano Asada.  My enchiladas were ok, a little too spicy for me and the sauce resembled more of a chili constancy than a sauce and was a red brown instead of the deep red I am used to.  To end the meal, and celebrate the birthday, we ordered the Mexican Apple Pie and the Mexican Brownie.  Both were worth saving room for and the server made it special with a sparkler candle.  Even with the missteps, our server was quick to offer our diner a new option since her original was too spicy.  The manager also checked in with us several times to make sure things were right and everything was handled.  Those two things alone impressed me and will be the reason we come back."}
{"text":"My first visit here I had been wanting to try this place for awhile but wasn't sure if it was child friendly. After a horrible experience at Carlos O'Briens we had no choice & it worked out well for us :) We walked in on Mothers Day with no reservations & were happily greeted & seated with no wait time bonus!!! We ordered our drinks & our daughters kids meal very nice atmosphere & ok to bring children as long as they are behaved its a more upscale place with casual dress. I order the steak & enchillada it was delic :) husband ordered a chicken dish it did look a little under cooked but husband is super weird about chicken so he ate it anyhow. Food came out fast & looked very pretty too . All in all we were pleased the only recommendation I had was our server was not the friendliest was not rude but could tell he could have cared less to be at work. I will defiantly return again. Ps it's not the place to go if your looking for \"Mexican  Food \" it's not greasy it's very light & filling so a great option if you want flavor & not all the grease :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my top favorite restaurants. Maybe it's the margaritas... Or perhaps it's the chips and salsa... Or the chipotle chicken fajitas...  I always get the Pineapple margarita. Be careful, they aren't stingy in terms of alcohol! They are made with high quality ingredients, so you can expect to pay $10 to $12 for one of these babies. I can't drink more than 2 or I would be on the floor upon walking out.  Service is always excellent. The bar is sometimes a bit held up, BUT remember what I said about those top shelf margs...  I don't like the smokey salsa. They offer two, and I generally dislike smokey flavors so it's nothing against Cantina Laredo specifically. The other salsa is another story. My dad and I munch on it and usually get seconds.  I always order the chipotle fajitas. They are absolutely delicious and served with warm tortillas, rice and beans.  Overall, the ambiance is intimate, the food and drink is unrivaled, and the service is exceptional.   Also, the desserts always smell really really good. My margaritas are considered my desserts, however, so I have not had the chance to try any sweets. I think you should though, yelper. Listen to your nose. Or just follow my lead and order another margarita."}
{"text":"Awesome restuarants and good with big parties also try there sangria and margaritas  , very great , worth it."}
{"text":"After looking over their pictures on Yelp I really wanted to check this place out. Their margaritas are what caught my eye, however they don't even put them in those jumbo glasses anymore.   The lover and I came, i think it was the day after New Years. We were waiting for a good 10 minutes before a hostess even came. When she finally came out she said that they are short staffed so it will be a little bit of a wait. The restaurant was maybe half filled. Why couldn't they seat us even if they were short staffed? After being tired of waiting, we decided to just sit at the bar and order. I ordered two traditional steak tacos and the tableside guacamole as well as a strawberry margarita. The guacamole was pretty good. i think it needed a bit more salt. The tacos were ok, nothing special and my margarita was decent.   I think they're a bit overpriced. Our bill came out to about $60 w/ tip for two drinks, my tacos, guacamole and my fiance's entree. Also, the customer service was not great at all. I'm not sure why they would not be able to seat us and make us wait, even though they were short staffed the restaurant was half empty. I would probably only come back for drinks during happy hour and sit at the bar, but that's it."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service had to leave, would not accommodate us. Will never come again!!!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here for a birthday dinner and it was simply amazing- on par with my favorite The Mission out in Old Town Scottsdale. We shared several dishes and we really loved everything- including the delicious margaritas! The pomegranate one I had was simply one of the best I've ever had. I'm getting hungry just thinking about their amazing menu. Yummmerz!"}
{"text":"Nice place- we went for happy hour and sat at the bar. Not crowded when we were there (a Thurs evening)  Bartenders suggested the tacos and they were very very good (we had barbacoa). Also had the grilled chicken nachos and the tableside guacamole. All tasted really fresh and good.  Loved the HUGE 5.00 house marg-- noticed the other specialty drinks were very expensive, like 11.00-12.00!! I THINK the house marg was the only happy hour special (at 5.00 like I said) but you'll have to check me on that.  Choices can be very limited in Scottsdale proper- it is either super casual (think: Rubio's!) or super exclusive/expensive (read:snobby)  We usually end up on the patio at Carlos O'Brien's (also off Bell Rd) but this was a nice change pf place. Classier."}
{"text":"Wanted a change of pace for a Saturday lunch with a friend, so we decided to meet up at this place.  It took quite some time for someone to greet as after we walked in. (Not a good start for any restaurant)  We decided on the Happy Hour menu (good prices), so we sat at a high top table by the bar.  If we called ahead, it may had been quicker to get water and chips delivered to our table. I think the wait when we walked in was a sign of things to come.  When our waitress finally arrived, so came off as having an attitude, although I'm sure she was attempting to be cute/funny.  After ordering a few of their appetizers, which tasted AMAZING and were delivered relatively quick, we where still hungry.   Because of the lack of service when we first arrived, we decided to go somewhere else to grab deserts, since we didn't want to give this restaurant any more of our money.  That said, I've been there for lunch before during the week several times and had a wonderful experience! I'm guessing that my experience this time around was not typical.   Will still try them again in the near future to see if the experience is better."}
{"text":"I don't often give 5 stars, but my meal was flawless from start to finish. This review is 70% food and 30% service based. Only because I sat at the bar and didn't get the full dining experience. But I have to say that my bartender was sweet, friendly, attentive and gave excellent recommendations. Even the chips and salsa are a cut above the rest. They have this warm Chipotle salsa that is to die for. And the other, more typical style salsa is perfectly nice as well. I arrived for happy hour and started with the $6 sopes and a cup of the arroz con pollo soup. So good! And you can't beat a $5 margarita made with fresh squeezed lime juice and silver tequila. Had the avocado enchiladas for an entree and couldn't believe how delicious every single bite of every dish was. Everything was infused with flavor, even the black beans.  For the price you really can't beat this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic Food! Love their table side guacamole and enchiladas. I also sometimes come just to eat nachos. Fantastic all around. Definitely make sure you stop by when you are in town. This is a high end Mexican chain so make sure to wear nice casual to fancy clothing. :)"}
{"text":"I like the food here except that it is a little pricey for the service sizes.  Great ambiance and service.  I always wondered why it is not as popular as Cafe Leone across the path.   Great enchiladas but ask for 2 or they'll give you one.  Great sauces.  Carne asada is tasty.  Nice bar menu, fresh food and spacious for business lunch."}
{"text":"In terms of food, this place was very disappointing. I thought the ceviche was terrible - there was way, way too much salt in the mixture and it was effectively inedible. The bright red chips that came with the ceviche, along with the regular chips that came with the guac were super crisp and tasted of stale oil. The guac was tasted good where it was mixed properly, but there were two huge chunks - almost a half avocado's worth - of solid, underripe avocado, which is unacceptable at this price. The salvation of the meal was probably the flan. While it was closer to being overcooked, with some air bubbles scattered throughout, it was still pretty close to a decent, smooth flan. I don't think I'll be back given the time plethora of options for good Mexican food in the area."}
{"text":"Overall good meal on a pleasant outdoor evening.  Service was quick, but waiter was challenged to deliver it accurately.  Fresh guacamole dip made table-side was very good.  But support staff forgot to serve the soup appetizer.  Wrong dessert was made table-side, but was otherwise tasty."}
{"text":"Just wanted to add to my review about one special server named Jaclyn who we get quite often when we eat here.  She always makes us feel so welcomed each and every time.  She is always knowledgeable on the menu items.  Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"Review update: Not sure what is going on with this place but the quality of the food is definitely gone downhill. They only bring one salsa out you have to ask for the second one.  I ordered the carnitas and it came out very dry not very good at all and I've had this in the past. Manager said they deep fry it now which dries it out.  The black beans were rancid did not taste good actually got sick after the meal. Not sure if I'm coming back very disappointed was one of our favorite restaurants   Again great meal.  Well presented.  The new ceviche is spot on.  So fresh and sea bass was done perfectly.  Had carne asada poblano, what great medley of flavored.   Carne Asada was done perfectly. Missed it on desert though.  Had apple pie and there was just too much salt in the crust. Server was Theresa and she did a fantastic job!  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"They claim to be gourmet mexican cuisine...  I've had better mexican food from street vendors.  Service was awkward, food was mediocre at best and pricing was way too high.  Ordered the \"barbacoa\"...  It was basically boiled meat with absolutely no flavor.  Menu stated it was brisket, it seemed more like top round:/  the tortilla chips were good!  Won't go back..."}
{"text":"I just had lunch and I have to say it was the worst Mexican food I have ever had, extremely bland and nothing to it. The chicken enchiladas just had boiled chicken in them, no cheese, sauce or onions/peppers and the sauce on top was bland. The two other people had different items and they did not like theirs at all.  We even had to wait to be seated with only a few people in the restaurant on a Saturday afternoon.  Don't waste your time or money here go anywhere else!!!"}
{"text":"A great restaurant with unique mexican dishes. Service was below average, but the food was fantastic. Tastes and combinations you won't find at regular mexican places."}
{"text":"Food and margaritas are really good. Food and drinks are pricey and the menu is limited. Overall, nice \"once in a while\" place to eat."}
{"text":"Went here for the Las Vegas Food &Wine Champagne brunch and was so disappointed. There was about 75 people waiting outside for the event to start then right on time there was 1 girl checking everyone in. A huge mob of people cramming into the door way to talk to one girl. We were not seated by anyone, and were told to, \"head straight back.\" But there were not tables or seats left in that direction and were fortunate enough to get one of the last tables inside, a lot of people ended up outside due to the lack of seating. The menu stated that we could go to the buffet and/or order off the menu, but I had to ask someone to take my order. The buffet was underwhelming as well consisting of fruit, eggs, potatoes, and biscuits; no bacon or meat of any kind. For a \"champagne brunch\" we thought there would be glasses of champagne or mimosas that would be passed out or brought around but we ended up having to wait in about a 30 person line to have one made in a rocks glass because they ran out of the flutes. After that, I got in the buffet line and there were no plates for about 10 minutes. The ordered food was not much better :( the take on steak and eggs had little steak on the plate and both the French toast and huevos rancheros were way too sweet to eat. All in all, pretty disappointed :(( and we were so excited for this event!"}
{"text":"Loved the Cantina Laredo in Houston but found everything from the food to the service to be lackluster at this location.  The hostess's greeting was odd.  She stood facing away from us and while wiping at an already clean portion of the counter behind the host's station, looked over her shoulder and said, 'hi'.  This being the full extent of her introduction, we volunteered that there were two in our party.  She seated us right next to the front door.  Seeing that the restaurant was still mostly empty, I asked if we could be seated elsewhere, to which our non-emotive hostess agreed.  It took ten minutes before our server arrived, which at 2pm on a Saturday seems excessive.  Our six month old is still BFing, and is still very much allergic to nonhuman dairy proteins in her milk.  I'm talking blood in her diaper allergic.  So it's important that my wife not have dairy which is something she was clear about.  The server assured her that the dish she was looking at did not contain any cheese, but as it turns out, it did.  Being cautious, my wife caught it before diving in.  By the time she received another dish, I was already finished with mine, which brings me too...  ...queso.  It's probably my fault for not remembering that Americans generally think velveeta is what queso means.  I ordered a steak fajita burito that was topped with cilantro and tomato slices, that is to say, three leafs of cilantro, and five pieces of chopped tomato.  And the plastic cheese smothering.  It's like ordering a dish and expecting filet mignon wrapped in bacon and getting filet mignon wrapped in bologna.  I might as well poor ketchup on the fajita steak.  Given that our visit was lengthened considerably by their inattention to detail, and the fact that our dining experience was undermined by only one of us eating at any given time, a comp on one of the dishes would've been nice, but was not forthcoming.  Just another mediocre Mexican restaurant.  There are better options."}
{"text":"Great happy hour.    Loved the old school nachos. Not a mound of chips and cheese, but a chip each decorated with refried bean cheese and with Guak and sour cream and grilled jalapeños."}
{"text":"A phone call from an out of town buddy summoned me to Cantina Laredo tonight for a dinner. We arrived at 7pm and were seated at the bar. Our waitress was very friendly and got us waters and menus, then quickly back to take drink orders. An order of their table made guacamole was done along with a Pineapple infused margarita for me.  This is where is started slipping away. Happy hour was only 5 minutes over, yet no offer to sneak in the cocktail. $11.95 for the margarita could have been 1/2 off. We did mention we were first timers here. That kind of rubs me the wrong way. The chips and salsa brought to our table were ok, but half the bowl was full of chip crumbles. Nothing to put the $9.95 guacamole on....she did eventually bring more chips about the same time as our main orders arrived. I had tacos barbacoa...which was ok, meat was tender, a little kick in the chipotle sauce. Nothing to write home about....beans and rice on the side. $13.95 I think was the price. My friend had the carnitas that were supposed to have the bone but we were informed all out of bone in pork, so just regular pork. He said it was ok.  Would I go back here? Probably not for the food, but I would for Happy Hour and half off margaritas as it was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Service is going downhill - usually feel very rushed by servers and the check shows up despite wanting another couple cocktails. You need to show up early for happy hour because they won't honor happy hour prices u less you sit at the bar (if it's full - too bad!).  New serve Jose seemed very green to the food service industry and came across as rude and disinterested. Sunday brunch can be a good value if you get the right server - otherwise I'd venture elsewhere."}
{"text":"I like the food here. The Bar is definitely the best place to sit. The bartender are extremely nice. They get the food out quickly and make great recommendations."}
{"text":"Came here with the family and was very dissapointed. I don't have any problem spending 20-30 for a dish but this place is way overpriced. Portions are very small and frankly the food was not flavorful; most of it was drenched in sauces and spices to cover up the poorly cooked meat.  The best part was finishing my kids cheese burgers, they were way better than our meals.   Guacamole was $11 and it was plain.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Dang, Cantina Laredo - I wanted to like you so hard!  Like a hot date that ends in a restraining order, like an incredible hike that ends in poison oak or skunk spray - I've walked past this place for years, imagining a swanky, high-end Mexican food joint behind the dark windows and high prices; sadly, what I found was a very regular, uninspired restaurant serving up some rather meh Mexican food.  This was a 'man behind the curtain' Wizard of Oz moment for me.  Good things?  Mmmmmm - the warm spicy salsa which they serve along with another milder cold one (not so good) and chips is the reason this place gets 2 very enthusiastic stars from me - SO DELICIOUS!  It was hook-me-up-to-a-feed-bag delicious.  Service was quick and pleasant.  After that though, it all goes downhill.  Being vegetarian, I can 99% of the time find something meatless and tasty when I go out to eat but there were very few such options here.  I ended up selecting the Enchiladas de Espinaca and subbed in a Cheese & Onion one to shake things up a bit (I know, I'm very exciting).  When my meal came out, the waitress said she had the kitchen put zucchini alongside my Mexican rice instead of beans (wtf - who in their right mind opts out of beans for zucchini at a Mexican food restaurant?!); so began the first of my meal modifications - I might note here that while being veggie, I am a pretty low-maintenance diner.  So, just as the black beans are being brought out, I realize the sauce atop my cheese enchilada consists of red chili with beef chunks - again wtf - in my 31 years of life on this earth, no Mexican food joint I've ever visited has ever converted a cheese enchilada to a meat one via the sauce!  The waitress said they could make me a new cheese & onion with sour cream sauce atop (cringe).  The mushroom and spinach enchilada was kinda gross - something about the oil they used to sauté the spinach in gave it a strange taste and the button mushrooms looked like they had been plunked into it straight out of a can.  The zucchini and cheese & onion enchilada were nothing I would ever want to order again.  Black beans were alright - hard to mess those up though.    In defense of Cantina Laredo, if you're a big meat eater, perhaps you might have more luck here than I.  The place was clean, the workers were nice, the one aforementioned salsa is killer.  But this place is neither authentic nor new-agey Mexican, not worthy of the steeper price points, and certainly lacks any great ambience to carry the lackluster food.  Don't think I will be auditioning this place for a second date or hike - would strongly consider rolling around in poison oak or getting skunk sprayed over coming back - it was that bad."}
{"text":"According to their sign they are \"modern Mexican\"...which basically means \"same things as other Mexican restaurants except a fancier setting\". Just kidding, that's not nice - there are several options on the menu that you wouldn't see at La Fiesta but let's not get carried away, it's not a new form of cuisine.  I was happy to find Mole Enchiladas on the menu since mole is friggin awesome! I wasn't super amped about these babies though...worth trying but the mole had a little too much tang to it and not enough depth of flavor.   The guacamole should definitely be purchased. There is a guac-girl who comes around and makes it at your table. She'll use 1 and a half avocados and ramp up the spiciness however you like it. She also has cilantro in her ingredient cart which is yummy.  Service was subpar. Our waiter was not very attentive - seemed to have too many tables to deal with."}
{"text":"I have not been there in years. I had guests and we decided to go. The service was ok, they don't give you small plates for the chips and salsa. The place was dirty, chairs were dirty and it smelled horrible. When the food arrived it was bland and very generic. Will never go back and they need to remove gourmet from the name. We love to support Gilbert businesses but this place is horrible."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. The service and food are incredible, we make it a point to stop in here whenever we are in town and recommend to friends and family going to Vegas, especially for the happy hour. We always go in a large groups and they take wonderful care of us. I love it here!!"}
{"text":"The food was great. We had the brisket tacos which were absolutely delish and I really like the pickled onion with it. Hubs had the asado. He says it was well seasoned. He cleaned the whole plate. We washed it down with two cantina margaritas and a couple baskets of tortilla chips and salsa which was also super tasty. Service was a little slow but we had a great lunch and would def go back."}
{"text":"Had the carne asada wrapped around the chile and shrimp.  It came recommended and it did not dissapoint.  Glad I has a chance to eat here while visiting Scottsdale.  Hope to return here someday, the other dishes I saw at the table were Mexican dishes I've never seen at other restaurants."}
{"text":"Updated   Still coming to this wonderful place with almost two years under my belt of visiting. Still, I enjoy lilies guac, but it seems she has done a wonderful job training everyone on how to make it, everything with fresh jalapeños is the way I take it. I've been there for brunch and dinner and love both menus, mimosas with breakfast and tamarin lemonade for dinner. I tend to venture with the cilantro salad, it's great when trying to be healthy. Everything is always fresh and you get exactly what you want. Service is great, we have a great experience every time, no matter if they are busy or not. Everything is beautiful inside creating the best atmosphere that we could have, calm and upbeat. I will continue to come back and always will, and if I find another city with one, I'll be in that spot so quick to eat my favorite part, those wonderful chips that come complimentary.     :) thanks guys so much"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch at work. The menu looked good and I was ready for some good food. The waiter came and I asked if there was cilantro in the item I wanted to order. He said everything had cilantro. I asked if there was anything at all with no cilantro and he said no. I told him I was allergic and he still said absolutely everything had cilantro. Finally he said I could have a cheese enchilada. It came and the cheese inside was not even melted. It had two sides of beans because the rice has......cilantro. I ordered some sour cream and miraculously it had no cilantro. The meal was lukewarm, not even up to Taco Bell standards. The beans were flavorless. I cannot imagine that I could not have had something without cilantro. And my meal came on like a kids meal sized plate. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I found it attending a BNI meeting as a visitor. Now that I am a member I get to eat there every week. The salsa is off the charts. The last time I ate there I had the beef quesadillas and I was floored with the flavor of the meat. The staff are pleasant and provide a enjoyable dinning experience. Shauna is our server and she is on point. See you Thursday"}
{"text":"Fine, fine food but nothing too exciting. I'd rather get traditional, non-fancy Mexican food than the froufrou fare here. My carne asada had wonderful flavor but was extremely fatty. My 10-year-old hated her quesadilla and didn't eat much."}
{"text":"2nd time here and second time the food has been great. I think I previously gave it a 4 because I thought it was a little pricey, but I'm upgrading it to a 5 because I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"Not bad. The closest thing to Tex Mex I've found outside of Texas. The fajita meat was cooked well and had a decent marinade. The salsas were unique. One medium heat, warmed, and smokey chipotle. The other mild heat, chilled, and with a tomato and onion flair. Not bad. The queso was quite good. A little spicier than I care for, but solid. The refried beans were  smokey, not something I cared for. The greatest disappointment was the tortillas. Bagged, not homemade. I'd return here for a TM fix if ever stuck in Vegas for a long period again, but Tejas has far better options. God bless Texas."}
{"text":"I'm with Ashley, can't believe I've not written a review.  Amazing, my favourite Marg's in the entire valley. You see those people squeezing those wee limes all day long. I really can't stand an over sugared sour mixed yankee margarita. I've always sat at the bar, had brilliant service, grand  late night and early eve happy hours. They have daily specials too. I love their chips and salsa, warm and not overly salted like el segundo (no offense segundo, I love lettuce entertain you, but your chips and salsa are wayy  to over NaCl(ed).  If you order the guac, you don't have to get the table side you can order one from the kitchen and its a bit cheaper. Cheers and thanks for turning me around now a regular."}
{"text":"I come here for happy hour sometimes.  You cant beat the deal.  The margaritas are good and cheap..not overly sweet.  The Ahi Tacos (they use sashimi) are excellent and so is the sizzling apple pie."}
{"text":"Came here because we were at San Tan mall and wanted Mexican food. Didn't realize it was going to be this fancy, high end place tiller walked in. the service was great and the free chips and salsa were good and they kept them coming. drinks were filled. the food though... definitely not authentic and their ceviche I was soooooo super sad after I tried it. they jazzed it up with things that shouldn't be in ceviche like capers and olives and it wasn't in a tomato juice broth and it was so sour and pickled that I couldn't finish the seafood in the dish to atleast get my money's worth. my mom got their fish tacos and those were pretty good. overall it's ok but I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a rainy afternoon and couldn't have picked a better place. The food was AMAZING and the service exquisite! Table side guacamole preparation was a treat to watch, but ever better to eat. Portion sizes were pretty generous for lunch so neither of us left hungry."}
{"text":"Great spot. Not particularly the place I would have taken two toddlers but they rolled with the punches and allowed us a good meal out of the house, despite the small mess our munchkins made. Thank you! Im always leary when dining out because I have chosen an alternative gluten/dairy-free lifestyle but was pleasantly impressed that they were so accommodating. It was no bother to remove the cheese or sauce from my fish tacos (and removing or not eating the shells myself at the table was obviously a breeze).. Yum!! Though eating the chips was difficult a small spoonful of salsa every so often still made me feel like part of the experience.. Great!! Now im hungry."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the ambiance and decor here. But that's about all I enjoyed during a big birthday dinner that I attended here.... The food was mediocre, and overpriced for what you get. The drinks were also quite expensive. I came here on a busy Friday night, and it was totally PACKED, which is probably a good sign, but I was overall very underwhelmed by the entire experience. I kinda prefer Roberto's Taco Shop food-wise :/  Okay, I lied. I did like our server. He was very friendly and had a great personality. But the service overall was VERY slow and inaccurate. He also made a huge deal out of trying to split the check...and in the end we just split it for him."}
{"text":"About the only things that Cantina Loredo has going for it is the staff and a convenient location  and so we keep going back.   The service here is really very good.  But here's the problem:  The food is just average and the margaritas are not very good - but they are OK.  Even so... prices here are pretty high - and always have been - so I can't blame the prices on rising food costs.  For example, the house margarita is $9, the Queso Laredo (yellow velveeta-like cheese dip with 1 spoon of ground meat on top) tastes like cheese dip from a jar and it's $12 and the guacamole is $10...  The beef fajitas are almost flavorless... Margarita prices are a little better at Happy Hour - and there is a small \"tapas\" menu...  We do end up going back for the service and the convenient location... and every time we leave just a little more disappointed in the margaritas and food.   This chain is missing something - maybe it could start with a better house margarita recipe.   I really do want to like the place... it is so convenient... but the food doesn't have any flavor.  This is the Denny's of \"gourmet\" Mexican food.    I've been to Cantina Loredo in Dallas - and the Dallas Airport, too.  The food and margaritas are all the same at all location - and so are the prices.  Very corporate.  Very consistent.   Just something missing...   So, if you happen to be in Gilbert, AZ, and or just passing through - then Casa Laredo is a convenient, \"safe\",  very run of the mill Mexican food chain restaurant experience at the local mall with really good custoemr service."}
{"text":"I was totally surprised at how good this restaurant is.  I agree with everyone else on the service, decor, and margaritas!  The guacamole made table side was really good and fresh.  However, I really enjoyed my meal as did my dining companion. We had cerviche and Tacos Pescado.  Both were execellent.  i would highly reccomend this restuarant to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"Service is slow and very absent tonight. Been here 45 minutes still haven't ordered food."}
{"text":"Great food and price was very reasonable!  Waitress was very helpful and kind!  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Like many others writing here, I gave this place several chances and now I'm done. Will not go back.   The food and drinks have typically been good for a sit-down chain, but not great.  But the service and management are inexcusably bad. Two times in a row I have made reservations and arrived with my family to be told there was a twenty to thirty minute wait.  Neither time was the place that crowded, both times were Friday evenings when they should have been well-staffed, and both times the excuse was they were \"understaffed.\" Also, both times we waited five minutes before anyone even acknowledged us at host desk. We sucked it up and waited (30 mins) the first time and ended up with two mismatched tables pushed together next to the kitchen. Second time we walked.   Cantina Laredo is just not that good that they can get away with these kinds of management and service deficiencies. Hope something better takes their place when they inevitably shut down."}
{"text":"Our favorite spot during our time in AZ. To start they have a very convenient location but managed to create a great atmosphere with a romantic patio with adorable outdoor fireplace and great sunsets. The waitstaff was attentive, helpful and so friendly. We loved out singing server Fernando! The drinks are delicious and decently priced (strong - no skimping here!). We highly recommend the classic margaritas and mojitos! The carne asada stuffed with poblano and table side guac were the best!"}
{"text":"So I came here for a big group event.  They had us sitting in a nice private area.  The decor was very upscale Mexican with dimmed lighting throughout the restaurant.  The staffs were very courteous and helpful.  I ordered an Enchilada dish and it was pretty good for the price.  The ingredients used tasted fresh and prepared in a somewhat artsy fashion.   If you're in the neighborhood and looking for style Mexican, definitely stop by here, but if you seek authentic Mexican, look elsewhere.  Overall, it was just a purely good upscale Mexican experience."}
{"text":"A couple girlfriends & I stopped to grab a late night bite here before we headin to The Grand Canyon. We had the pleasure to be helped by Favio; dude was amazing!! He had us laughing the whole time & also made great suggestions. His dancing & singing is off the chart, as well as his facial hair! haha.  We really enjoyed our time at dinner, thanks to FAVIO!! :)"}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was bad. My husband had chicken fajitas and said they were just OK. I had chicken enchiladas with mole sauce. Although there  was lots of shredded chicken in them they were tasteless. There did seem to be a bit of cheese but couldn't taste it. The Mole sauce was good but there was not much on the enchiladas. Although the rice was reddish colored it had no flavor or seasonings and tasted like plain white rice. The black beans had no seasoning or flavor either. They brought us two salsas, one spicy and one just a bit spicy. The spicy sauce had no flavor except for spicy and smoked. The other sauce was just OK. The guacamole that came with my husband's fajitas was horrible. It tasted like store-bought and like it was old. After reviewing their Menu online I was excited to try this but was very disappointed. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"What a gorgeous day to stop in for a nice lunch break. Carlos welcomed me immediately with a smile and some chips and salsa. I come to Tivoli often and love the energy that Carlos always has. Today I was unsure what to have for lunch and Carlos mentioned some of his favorite dishes which sounded perfect for my lunch today! Thank you Carlos for being so attentive! You rock!"}
{"text":"I had originally went to the San Tan Village location, mainly because we wanted to go somewhere else but didn't want to wait for an hour for a table. We went here instead and was seated nearly immediately.  They had a chicken dish called Tampico that was amazing. We went to the Scottsdale location and noticed that Tampico was only on the dinner menu but I could still order it for lunch.  We went back an other time and they had just opened for lunch and there were only a few other customers. We were seated and was brought chips and salsa.  Their hot salsa, my favorite, is made from habenero peppers and I need some water to go with it. Nobody brought us any water so we didn't touch the chips. We waited a bit longer and my wife was getting annoyed. I noticed that there were some chips spilled on the floor and someone had stepped on them so they were more or less ground into the carpet. Bussers were around but refused to clean it up and by that time we had been waiting more than 10 minutes so we got up and left to have lunch at Flo's which is only a few yards away. We never went back to Cantina Laredo and I've heard that location has since closed."}
{"text":"Cute place, like everything in Tivoli Village. Really great menu options, including vegetarian which really appealed to me. Two enchilada options I noticed were spinach/mushroom, and avocado/artichoke which is the choice I made. I think I had maybe 2 pieces of artichoke and 3 avocado slices. Instead they were filled with green chiles and jalapeños which I was not expecting. I was disappointed in that because I was really looking forward to some avocado cheesy goodness!! :( . The black beans served on the side however were really flavorful and delicious. I also ordered their signature margarita which was very good, very fresh tasting, not syrupy like some can be. Service was great, attentive, my water glass was always full, so good job there. Overall just not super impressed with the food!"}
{"text":"Ordered kids mini tacos and the meat came out extremely spicy. We asked if we could re order the tacos less spicy and they said it was pre made taco meat. How can you be a gourmet Mexican place with pre made and rewarmed meat too spicy and serve it to children? How hard is it to make ground meat to order. The prices are high, we tried over salted dry fajitas chicken and beef were rubbery and the only saving grace for two stars was the table side guacamole. Service sucked, thy forgot to bring salsa."}
{"text":"I come here about twice a year when friends make the choice of where to meet up. Other than that, I'd never have a reason to come. The feel of the restaurant is really cool and trendy. The margaritas are also pretty delicious. But that's about where my positives stop.   The food is extremely overpriced and in my opinion not very good. For happy hour I usually get the street tacos. Nothing to write home about. Off the regular dinner menu I opt for something new every time hoping to discover a \"good dish\". So far I haven't found it.  I'm from AZ and I know my way around Mexican food, so maybe I'm biased. I'm all for culinary diversity but I really feel like their food is pre-made and heated to order.  I think the people that like this place probably don't like traditional Mexican fare which is just fine with me. They can eat it all up cause I won't be there to fight them for it!!"}
