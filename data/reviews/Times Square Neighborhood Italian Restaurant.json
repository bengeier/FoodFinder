{"text":"We have only had breakfast to comment on. The Bloody Mary bar was great. The pancakes fluffy and the waitress was great."}
{"text":"Great service  from our waitress Lisa R.  Nice portions. I LOVED the Pasta Giovanni.  The sauce was flavorful, and the sausage nice and tender.  Very clean with simple decor, which created a very relaxing and comfortable dining environment.  A return trip is definitely forthcoming."}
{"text":"The menu looked amazing and the staff are incredibly courteous. However, the place reeked of BO, with every whiff of air overpowering the senses.  Pepperidge Farm frozen garlic bread is significantly more tasty than their stale bread.  Overall, the food looked questionable and the pasta was either overcooked or super crunchy. I was envying Jack in the Box across the street or a can of chef boyardee. My 5 year-old cousin can boil \"normal\" pasta that's consistent. Why can't a business that charges upwards of 10 bucks a plate do the same?  I was honestly tempted to run, but was afraid I'd burn in hell; so I paid like a good citizen.  UPDATE: I spent 75 minutes this morning on the toilet. Their food will thoroughly cleanse your colon; be warned."}
{"text":"Tried them for breakfast. Prices were good, Food was \"ok\", but service was terrible.  We were seated by  the hostess and waited and waited and waited for someone to acknowledge our presence. Finally, just as we were standing up to leave, a server came over to take our drink order. (Not the place was NOT crowded or busy.)  She made some excuse about the not seeing us, though seated right at the end of the main walk way.  Our orders were taken and the food arrived. Again, it was \"ok\" - eggs cooked correctly, hash browns tasted good. Then we \"tried\" to pay our bill.  Our server took my card and left. Again we waited and waited and waited for her return. Finally, I started to look around and to find her. I watched her take an extended order at another table, bus another table, then go into the kitchen and chat with a coworker. When I finally got up and started to head her direction she returned with my card.  Maybe it was a bad day for them, but first impressions are everything."}
{"text":"We ordered a to go order and my wife wanted horse radish with her order. She got horse radish in the past when she ate in the restaurant. However, when she showed up to get her to go order, they told her they couldn't give her horse radish because they didn't have a button for it. The manager said they must have went out of their way to give her horse radish when she dined in. I guess they don't go out of their way for to go orders. The manager said the general manager would call us because horse radish is for bloody mary's only.   To top it off, the order was wrong. Terrible way to test customers.  I'm giving it one star because there is no option for -3 stars."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Food is awesome and the service is fabulous. I recommend the pasta Giovanni."}
{"text":"They get four stars from me.  Ate there a couple of weeks ago and enjoyed the meal.  My wife odered a dinner and I had a small salad and ordered a side meatballs and sausages.  Also ordered a side of garlic bread  Despite the service complaints on Yelp  our server was great!  My only issues were that bread should be complimentary and wine prices.  Why can't a resturaunt have a basic wine selection at a reasonable price.  I would certainly go out to eat alot more, especially Italian, if I didn't have to pay an arm and a leg for a couple of glasses of wine.  I can get basic 1.5 L bottle of wine for well under ten bucks....that would be good enough for most people.  Save the better stuff for those who will pay the price  but a reasonably priced wine will get me coming back to eat."}
{"text":"This place is so close to my house, I really want to like it. We went after it first opened and between horrible service (waitress seemed like she did not want to be there and we had little service) and terrible food we didn't return until today. We heard from neighbors that we should give it another try, so we did. We tried to make it for breakfast and were immediately seated. It wasn't that busy, but after sitting for more than 10 minutes without even getting a 'hello' we officially missed breakfast. We were finally helped, but I was disappointed that it took 40 minutes before we got our appetizer of chicken wings and 45 minutes (after we were seated) to get our lunch. The food was, again, mediocre. I ordered the lemon shrimp scampi and it was loaded with garlic and had no lemon flavor at all. My husband got a calzone, which he said was good and my dad got a ceasar salad, which he could only have a few bites of because the lettuce tasted old and dressing wasn't good. Once, again, we were disappointed with this restaurant."}
{"text":"We love this place. We probably eat here at least twice a month. Great food, great staff, and great ( cheap) beer! What else can you ask for?  I also love the fact that it is a small family owned restaurant. I love supporting local business owners.  I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Very friendly staff and smiles all around! I love the fried mozzarella and calzones!! Would eat here everyday if I could!! Cameron was my server and he was excellent! I recommend asking for him as you're server!! Thanks Times Square!!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Service with a genuine smile and delicious food! The Tortilini D'Angelo is a must. The pizza was fresh and tasty. We will definitely be back next time we're in the area as we were visiting  from  Los Angeles :)"}
{"text":"Service was okay. Asked for the market price for veal and was told $18.90 but the bill showed $20.90. I was told it went up but they took off the $2.00. When we got or dinner I asked why we only got one garlic bread. Waitress told me my dinner didn't come with garlic bread. The chef brought me one and said it did come with dinner and it was his mistake, The salad plate was warm. My vegetables were lukewarm. My wife was suppose to get 2 chicken breasts. They were flat like they cut one breast in half and and they were dry. I asked for linguini instead of spaghetti and offered to pay extra and was told \"we don't do that\", I have no desire to ever go there again."}
{"text":"I was just pasting by, and decided to try this place out. The food is very expensive, and it wasn't good at all."}
{"text":"Have been here 3 times over the past few months.  Two times there were issues with our orders.  The first, they included chicken on the meal in which we did not ask for. We ate around the chicken, and the waitress had the dish comped on the check.  The second time my meal took about 25 minutes to come out of the kitchen.  The waitress (can't remember her name but she had an AK-47 tattoo) kept coming back to make sure we had our beverages topped off, and to keep us posted on the status of our order.  She also asked her manager to comp the dish on our check.  They've earned my repeated business with their great service and good food.  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has become a favorite of our family's, partly because the food is delicious and affordable, and partly because the staff there are so friendly and helpful. Just last night they helped calm my crying toddler, answered questions for my 5 year old patiently, and recommended a house made gnocchi for me that was amazing. My husband tried the pasta Giovanni on our first visit, and now he will never order anything else! Thanks for being a great neighborhood restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great little old school Italian restaurant. Food was good. Nothing special, but what we ordered was good renditions of Italian American restaurant standards.  Service was good. Price was a bit higher than expected for what I was getting, but not outrageously so.  Be a good date night place for sure..."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about my neighborhood resteraunt. Decided to try it for dinner. We were not disappointed. Everything from appetizers to 3 different pasta dishes and dessert was excellent. Service was above average also. We can't wait to return."}
{"text":"To be honest I have never eaten here and never will. I live behind this establishment and they're the most inconsiderate \"neighbor \" one could ever ask for.  So much noise so late at night....power washing,  revving motorcycles, employee parties. Still continues even after nicely approaching owner/manager.  Now resort to calling police."}
{"text":"What a great find! Terrific Italian food--all freshly made with your order. Located near Scottsdale Airport runway--northeast side of Scottsdale Rd and Redfield. YUM!"}
{"text":"Having lived in the Valley for 16 years and being from NY, good family Italian restaurants are just hard to come by.  We've been to the \"typical recommended\" places, but the prices of some of these places are just getting too ridiculous for a family to eat out at.  This was our first time here, after hearing lots of good things about this place.  We opted to sit at the bar, although, for a Saturday night about 6, there was room in the dining room for us to sit.  We ordered some drinks, good HH prices, but I wish there were a few more options for HH appetizers.  We ordered clams and bruschetta, both were DELICIOUS!  Our server was just fun to hang out and chat with .  We asked for his recommendations and 1 of the 4 of us, did order what he recommended, the Pollo Marconi, which our friend said was very tasty.  The other orders were chicken parmigana and a pasta dish, with small changes.  Everything came out on time, delicious!  This is definitely a family friendly or casual hang out, neighborhood place and we will be coming back!  Prices were perfect as were portion sizes.  Definitely a MUST go to place!"}
{"text":"Tried this place because of previous reviews, and let me just say, this was by far one of the best places I have ever been. I had the tortellini d Angelo, my god it was amazing! The server, Damion, was the sweetest and made the place ten times better. It's nice to see people who love doing their job! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad we found this place!  Think the kind of food you'd take your spouse out to for an anniversary, but with Olive Garden prices.  The atmosphere will leave you wanting to hang out and get dessert, but you won't have room left after all that pasta.  Our service was excellent, with a staff that takes pride in the restaurant.  This place deserves your Sunday best, but you won't be out of place in jeans and a T-shirt.  Obviously we'll be going back, maybe this week!"}
{"text":"Okay too start off i really like this restaurant. I go about 1 time a month with my husband,but the last time we went this lady so called the manger grace and we talked the first time she came around seamed like she was irritated. Then she talked to us once more and one of the workers came up to ask her a question, and she snapped. She said your question can wait, im talking with people cant you see. She turned back to us and and said sorry about that. I said no,it fine you can go see what she needs. She said NO. We finished our conversation and she went to the person that had a question and started yelling at her and she seamed distressed. Me and my husband could kind of hear the coversation and she seemed like she was guilt tripping her. If your a manager you dont do that. She didnt seem like she wanted to listen to anything she had to say. Its like she has a nice side to costumers then is really mean to employees. I just thought i should bring that up to people's attention for her being like that, to anyone."}
{"text":"Don't let the pictures fool you! My daughter got chicken Alfredo, the chicken was canned chicken and bland! The fried mozzarella appetizer.... it's literally a block of cheese fried! My Nonna would be rolling over in her grave right now at how terrible and what a disgrace that is for being called, \"Italian food!\" And Kimberly, the server, was just as bad as the food! We sat down and was told three different times she'd be with us. Finally she was told to come to us after we asked if we could order an appetizer. We seen her two more times during our whole sitting. $40 wasted!"}
{"text":"Yum! I only tried the pizza slices lunch special, but service was friendly and prompt. I like the end of the runway location. I hear good things about the eggplant, so I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Saw this place on \"Check Please AZ\" and it looked good so the four of us gave it a try. First of all, let me say that they can produce a good plate of pasta and sauce.  There were four of us and the four dishes were good. The prices were not bad either, at least for the entrees.   Don't get any appetizers though. Their mussels were way over priced for the amount you get. Usually when you order mussels, you get a pail full of them. And that is why you pay $15 for a slue of them. This place gives you 10 pieces arraigned on a plate for that price. They tasted good but not worth the price. The calamari was tough and chewy. The bruschetta topping was good but the bread was not toasted enough and this made the dish soggy. The fried mozzarella was good.   We were there during happy hour, but only if you sit at the bar... so we paid full price... for these poor quality appetizers. If your going to offer happy hour prices for your customers, then offer it to all of the customers. Not like the dining room was all that. The atmosphere was plain, cheep tables and chairs, but clean.   The waiters and staff were friendly and attentive so they got well tipped for their efforts, but for the price of the mussels, I will be dining elsewhere."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Phillies, pizza and seafood. The ambiance is fabulous and the service is always outstanding. This place is my favorite."}
{"text":"So disappointed.  Had a menu in my hand and manager-owner pulled out of my hand and said wrong prices on this menu.  He was so rude.  Best part was the chef and for that I give 3 stars."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here for a first-time service was great food was great Kimberly was our server will be back here again"}
{"text":"Love this place, the staff is friendly and the food is delicious. The manicotti had lots of spinach, which I love ! The pasta Giovanni is my husbands favorite !"}
{"text":"We went there on a whim.  This was the best Italian food we have had in a long time. Good service and fantastic food.  The place also has a bar and multiple TVs.  The bar was not noisy and we were able to enjoy our meal without a lot of noise.  We will go again."}
{"text":"Cozy. Nice staff. Killer salad and cheese steak. Definitely coming back to try pasta!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad Time Square has this new location.  Can't beat the food or service. They have come a long way since their first location in an old circle K store on 27th Ave and Deer Valley Road."}
{"text":"We came in on a Thursday night and the experience was Phenomenal. Our waiter (Damion) was very Friendly and professional And new All the answers to our questions. The manager (Ariel)made our night with her friendly attitude and made us feel very welcome by her Appearance to the table And was willing to hold a Conversation. Between Damion, Ariel, and the kitchen staff we felt like family a will be telling everyone about this place. The food was the best in town!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A regular at the 1st location and they nailed it!! So happy as quality, service and ambience are darn to exact. So much larger a big plus!! Rock on Times Square, Rock On!!"}
{"text":"Service is a little slow however, the staff is friendly and helpful.  The food portions are large and very tasty. Two cocktails, an appetizer and two entrees - cost $50.00.  They have a bar with TV's so you can watch sports. (Football is almost here.... YAY!)    I also went back for breakfast a couple weeks later.  Service was slow however, breakfast was delish and affordable.   Note: you may want to double check your bill - we were charged for an item we never ordered or received.    Overall in my opinion, it's good Italian food and nice addition to the North Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable value. Certainly will take this over the pre-packaged Italian food at the big corporate guys. Staff is friendly and owners are onsite working all the time. New location is very nice at 7th St & Union Hills, lots more availability for lunch seating vs. the original location."}
{"text":"Just finished a FABULOUS dinner at the new location in Litchfield Park (13730 W Camelback Rd ste. 70) and I believe we have a new winner in the restaurant game in Litchfeld Park !!!   Our server (Terry L) gave is SUPERB service and i can honestly say with his very knowledgeable advice we had a exquisite service/meal.   The fried mozzarela was fresh and oh so very tasty and cooked to perfection and the accompanying sauce was memory making.   The Fettucine Alfredo was the absolute BEST I have tasted since my travels abroad in Italy itself !!! The pasta was fresh and the alfredo sauce was without comparison.  The Pasta Giovanni was a veritable palate pleaser and as fresh as can be, the combination of penne and muchrooms and slightly spicy sausage was a food vision I will not soon forget.  I am soooo pleased that we have a real restaurant within my area now and not the standard drive through crap establishments that have smothered the area.  Giant Kudo's to the new king of restaurants in the far west side !!!  F.Y.I. to my fellow veteran's and personnel at nearby Luke AFB, they also give a Very Generous 20% Military Discount for all of us who served our country and sacrificed much (with valid ID)"}
{"text":"Was a decent alternative to your neighborhood Olive Garden until was advised we couldn't order a side of angel hair pasta even if willing to pay the price of an entre. Apparently the Chef does not like making 'special orders'.  We were stunned as this restaurant is not considered fine dining and any talented Chef would attempt to please their Customers to keep a reputable brand and continued business. Part of a Chef's/restaurant's appeal is a desire to go above and beyond creating dishes according to the needs and wants of individual diners. However, this experience (and last) fell short of the effort."}
{"text":"Excellant food and service!  Awesome menu and great portions.  Very tasty!  I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food was PHENOMENAL! I have not had authentic Italian food since having dinner in Jersey with my sister-in-law's family! Sever Michael (last one left working there...lol) was friendly and attentive. Will be returning to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Have been to the Deer Valley location quite a few times and heard about this so decided to try breakfast on my Birthday here because DV was very crowded Saturday AM.  Friendly greeting and quick seating by the host. Quite a bit larger than the DV location, too. Waitress was very professional and took our order quickly.  Good portions and it was very delicious and served hot. Had the K special with bacon, sausage, eggs, hash browns and toast, and all orders were prompt.  Wife had the chicken salad which she loved and it fit her no egg diet, too.  We'll be back to try dinner here in the near future.   My wife even complimented how clean the bathroom was, and she is picky.  Ha"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good.   The service was great.   Location was clean and well lit.   You have an open view of the kitchen.   The salads are pretty large,  so you should share with others.     The tip jar at the hostess desk is tacky.   Tips should be shared with the host."}
{"text":"Very disappointing dinner tonight. Ordered a Sicilian pizza Togo and when I got home and opened the box, the pizza was burnt! Crust was burnt, the cheese was burnt, the entire thing was dry and, well, burnt. I'm surprised they let this pie out the door. $20 for a burnt pizza is extremely disappointing. There are two other pizza joints in the area that I frequent that would never do this. Even if they did, the would correct the mistake before it left the store. Go to Rays or NYPD and save yourself the time and disappointment"}
{"text":"I was initially excited when I first heard this location was opening. I loved the original location and have never had any issues there. We have been to the Union Hills location twice. I have been less than pleased with the experiences. The staff is not attentive, they run out of ingredients (spinach) and the food is sub par. The waiter \"forgot\" to put one of our orders in altogether. By the time the last dish came, everyone else was done. I would not go back to this location."}
{"text":"Searching for a place to lunch near my Scottsdale office, I happened upon Times Square. Too heavy for lunch, but made sure to try it for dinner.  The restaurant is in a very unlikely place--hidden amongst businesses in the Scottsdale Airpark. But the food is fantastic.  Our go-to Italian restaurant has been Uncle Sal's, but Times Square is just as good and isn't as crowded. We've had a variety of dishes and they've all been excellent, and I'm very picky when it comes to Italian. I'm not into the bougie Scottsdale Italian places. I like it how my grandmother made it--authentic and tasty.   The prices are reasonable and the service is very good. And please, do not pass on dessert. Their cannolis are to die for. If you're too full after dinner--get it to go."}
{"text":"Camelback and Litchfield location! Starting with service,  I found out this restaurant has been open less than a week. The staff was very efficient, pleasant, and very professional from top to bottom. Midway through my meal the director of operations Phil stopped by to see how everything. was w hich I appreciated. I chose the dinner salad, calamari, and pasta Giovanni. The salad was fresh veggies with spring mix, romaine lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, and peppercinis. The calamari with a red dipping sauce was cooked to perfection with a light breading and TENDER not like chewing on a rubber band.  THE HEARTY pasta dish had a spicy flavor with mushroom, chicken and beef over penne pasta. Excellent!!!! I am visiting from Indiana and returned with my son and his family. Tried the calamari again with the seafood pasta which had shrimp and baby clams. All of our dishes were great, service was awesome and the manager stopped by to ensure everything was to our satisfaction. Recommend!!!"}
{"text":"We got a a togo order. The spaghetti sauce looked like it had sat at the bottom of the pot all day it was just a big thick clump on top of pasta. Not appealing to look at all. Lasagna was so bad neither of those of who ordered it could finish it. I've ate there before and it was great but won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  I love the gnocchi.  The garlic bread is also very good.  This place is in a strip center so not the most prestigious location, but the food is really good and the service is usually good.  A little expensive, but the portions are large enough for a second meal the next day."}
{"text":"The poached hard eggs are runny, the raisin toast has a funny off taste. If you get french toast special,  you get 1 slice, no big deal but typically you get 2. Iced tea is good, so is the coffee."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian restaurant.  We had a large crew and the service and food was excellent. Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"food is good. customer service can be hot or cold.  most recent example, called to place a pick up order, in the middle of placing the order,  another phone started ringing in the back ground.  Dimitri (person taking my order) asked if I would mind holding and he then answered the other line and proceeded to take an order from the new caller, while I sat waiting.  After three minutes, he is still taking the order (I can hear him asking and answering questions).  I hung up. No matter how tasty the food may be, customer service is very important to me."}
{"text":"I came here with my parents and we were seated at a table near the kitchen. First thing I noticed: a layer of dust on the kitchen counter where they kept wine glasses. Our server was polite but was obviously trying to up sell the whole time. He asked what cocktails or wine we were going order. We all got waters. He then recommended an appetizer and my parents decided to order it. Later, presumably a manager, came by and asked how it was because she said the item wasn't selling. She said that's why the servers are recommending it to each table.... When our food came out the ravioli was boiling. They had baked it and it was literally boiling on the table. It was so hot, we couldn't eat it the entire time we were there. My mom notified them of the issue and they said, \"Yeah we know about that. We've been told before.\" If you know it's an issue... shouldn't you address it? The entire time we were there too the servers were yelling to each other across the restaurant. Apparently they had burned the bread for our table too because we heard the kitchen staff and server talking about it across the restaurant."}
{"text":"We have been meaning to try this place and I am so glad we did. Food was delicious! Started out with the fried mozzarella - YUM! Though honestly it was a little over priced for what it was. The family ordered the peppers and sausage, penne all vodka, and fettuccini alfredo. The food was excellent and service was fast. Generous portions and decent bread. Prices were reasonable. Atmosphere is a cross between a dark coffee shop and pizza parlor. Very casual but comfortable and very clean. We will definitely be back - a great neighborhood place with a lot of variety of choices on the menu."}
{"text":"I work with a lady who sister owns time square on seventh Street and Union Hills. I live just a mile from the resturant I just kept forgetting about it. The other night a friend spend the evening and we decided to go there for dinner. It was so delicious that we went back for breakfast and it was also delicious the place was clean the customer service was exceptional and I would definitely recommend and go back again."}
{"text":"Wow....things have changed!  We have eaten here many times and have always been happy with the service and the food. But this visit was bad from the get go. When everything you ask for you are told NO...can't do that,can't add that,  can't change that. And to boot food was not good.  We left saying not coming back here again, and we have been going for years. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here with my great nephew & his family as they live nearby. Walking in, we were quickly greeted and seated. Lots of folks eating here.  The menu was great, so many choices, big plates, small plates, and so many wonderful Italian dishes, real cuisine.  Everything we ordered was very good, very large portions and such friendly, helpful service.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is in the same building as our office and I was thrilled to see they were moving in as I'd been to other locations.  There is almost a daily visit for either breakfast or lunch from our team. My husband and I have also had dinner, nothing has ever disappointed!  Fun location and patio at the end of the Scottsdale Airport runway!"}
{"text":"I am inside the restaurant right now and I am very angry. Angry that I didn't come here before. I have never been here before and I'm very upset about that. First time in and this place is phenomenal. Great service"}
{"text":"Situated near the Scottsdale Airport, the location was a tad difficult to find and the industrial area was (at first) disconcerting- but as soon as we walked in, all of our fears disappeared!  Great place with good food and service.  Portions were plentiful and when they say \"piece of garlic bread,\" they mean 1/2 loaf!"}
{"text":"We tried an old italian restaurant out for the first time tonight, and did we ever find a good one very close to our house. It's called Times Square, and it's located on Deer Valley rd. Below are the dinners we chose. Pasta Giovanni~ sausage, chicken, and red peppers in garlic cream sauce & Linguini Principessa~ shrimp and clams in a garlic cream sauce. I think we just found a new favorite italian hang out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have decided to try and eat our way through the whole menu!!  Every dish is DELISH!!  We've had several different servers, and they are all so friendly, and go out of their way to make you feel like you're their only customer.  Shout out to Drew and Lisa....service with a smile and a funny comment.  You need to try this place, I swear you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Everything I've ever had on this menu is Amazing! I've always been in a huge group and we try a little of everything. Any seafood dish is superb! I especially love their mussels. Staff is very attentive and the place is fantastically clean and themed. Smells great as soon as you walk in...will eat here and support this place as long as I'm in the valley!"}
{"text":"I was there a couple of months ago but Am just getting around to writing this review.   This place was not too bad but not great the food tasted okay the waitress was nice.   I ordered spaghetti with veal.  I don't know although it tasted okay something was missing I just can't place it.   Kind of on the bland side.   The only complaint I have is my friend and I ordered salads but they only gave us like two minutes to eat it before they came out with the main dish. Not good timing.  Oh and we were there around seven or eight at night.    It was so loud we couldn't hear each other we had to shout I think the acoustics are really bad.  I would give it another shot though"}
{"text":"The breakfast menu is complete and the items are good. Lunch and dinner is over the top. All items from the sandwiches to the main entres are great. There is great care in creating these recipes and menu items. They make a new demiglaze every night. The Caprese Salad is great to share. The musels are served a couple diferent ways and both are great. The Pasta Giovani hits many different cravings. I usually have them provide the food for my birthday dinners. No matter how much food they cater, there never seem to be any left overs. Just as important as the food is the personal service. From the owners to the chefs to the servers, everyone here treats us like family. Lastly, if you like Bloody Marry's, they have a very complete Craft your own Bloody Marry Bar."}
{"text":"Looking for great tasting Italian cuisine ? Then Time Square is your place! Affordable prices, great tasting food ! Breakfast is delicious, lunch is delicious and I mean everything  for lunch is delicious ! Have not tried dinner yet . So don't be square my peeps go and try it for yourselves ! You may want to share , at least it works for me . Enjoy"}
{"text":"Can't think of enough good things to say about this place. We've been a few times and the food is always great. I've had the crab cakes (pesto dipping sauce, omg), calamari, a few pastas, pizza and ravioli. It's all been amazing. Their servers are beyond great. We often comes with our toddler, who can be as crazy as any toddler, and they are always so nice and patient with us. If the food was just meh (which its not, it's amazing), I would go back for the great service. I much prefer this location to the one on deer valley."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their sauces are ridiculously good, the seafood seems extremely fresh. I only have two things I would say: 1) their canolis aren't as good as other Italian restaurants; the filling almost seems chalky 2) their kids' menu has a good selection, but the red/marinara sauce they use for the kids' dishes seems considerably lower quality than that used in other dishes. Otherwise, I HIGHLY recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been coming here for two years! But in two years they have NEVER changed their taps!!!!!!!!!!!!! Come on!"}
{"text":"Awesome. beautifully we done after being famous Sams. first pizza in 8 months not burnt. first time I have had a pizza from Time Square in over 6 months. even after requesting not a burnt pizza and taking one back on New Years Eve. super friendly staff."}
{"text":"The good part was the food and the rest was pretty bad.   I had a calzone. Good stuff! Perfect price. Wife had some kind of pasta seafood dish. Waiter was great.   Here is where it all falls apart. The ambiance is that of a cafeteria. Crappy chairs. Lighting was distracting and the worst part was that they were showing cartoons on one of the tv. Let me repeat this for you. Friday night. 9pm. They were showing cartoons on one of the tv's! I was literally watching Garfield and Scooby Do! Not only that but we're listening to crappy teeny bop music. I bet Taylor Swift has not even been to Italy. How about a little Franky blue eyes while I sip my IPA and enjoy my calzone while watching ESPN!?!?  Beer selection was very good as well was the wine selection.   In closing, I hope the fix the ambiance to make it a little more intimate and \"Italian\" feeling."}
{"text":"We had reservations for today but unfortunately were not able to go to this location due to the blackout that occurred. While disappointing because we couldn't try this location out and because when we phoned and tried to see if we could be seated at the Deer Valley location we were told it would not be likely, but the night was saved by Grace. Grace was beyond awesome in making sure that we were still taken care of and making sure we would be able to be seated at the Deer Valley location and enjoy our night.   Thanks again Grace, you saved the night and my best friend visiting from out of state was able to eat at her favorite place before heading home!"}
{"text":"Third strike and I'm done  Just tried to order a simple 'to go order' Walked in waited at the front for 10 minutes. No one said hi, asked me if they could help... walked over to the bar waited ... same story!   Walked out again and I won't be back.    This was our first visit here....  We ordered 'take out'.  'Joe's Special' (as I am allergic to Eggs, Milk, etc and couldn't find much else and wasn't offered any suggestions) and my fiancé had Fettuccini Alfredo and 'added Chicken'  First impressions;   I wasn't blown away with the customer service - the girl on the phone didn't seem interested in helping me much.  I had a couple of questions re the menu and she was pretty clear on they don't 'make exceptions' 'substitutions' 'this is the menu' ...I really had no guidance as to what to order re my allergies etc   (We weren't offered the usual parmesan / chilly / pepper / condiments etc when I picked up the food either, which bugged me a little)   I didn't have to wait very long for the food to be ready which was great.   Maybe we will try this place again on a different night and see if it's better :)"}
{"text":"I have been to Times Square multiple times and consider myself a fan. I've been there for breakfasts, lunches, and dinners. On to last night...First, our waiter did excellent as our waiter. The food was good as usual however the fish was over fried in appearance but apparently it tasted fine as no one in our group sent it back. My reason for taking stars off was due to their, not sure if it is the owners or manager, attitude towards us when we got there. You need to know that I was a server throughout college and also helped with management duties at the privately owned restaurant.   The closing time for Times Square is 10:00 PM. We arrived at 9:30. The place had a couple of tables that had their food still on the table and were eating. Our server informed us that we needed to get our order in quickly because the kitchen was closing. Now I have been on both ends of this situation many times and this is the first time anybody has said anything like this. When I worked as a server the owner fired a waiter for seeing customers walking towards the door at 5 minutes before closing and changing the clock and then proceeding to tell the customers that we were closed.   So to the owners of Times Square. If you want to be able to send the kitchen staff home at 10:00 then please change your closing time to 9:30. Otherwise you and they should expect there to be times when a table walks in close to closing time and the kitchen will have to stay open. Not sure how long it will be until I go back."}
{"text":"Plenty of choices to choose from. Stop by and try something. The calzone must have been really good because my dad ate it so fast I didn't even get a chance to try a bite. My linguini was amazing."}
{"text":"New location, same fabulous menu, friendly staff, awesome location.  Go there, you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Had the Sausage and Peppers over pasta very filling. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Great food, huge portions. Our takeout was packaged great and food was still hot when we got home"}
{"text":"Pasta Giovanni is great. Pizza is good. Salads in house are good but to go have been wilted. Restrooms are clean, except wet counters. Management is mostly reasonable, but annoying. Overall it's about an 8 out of ten, maybe 8.5"}
{"text":"This place rocks. The food is amazing and the customer service is amazing. Our server Greer was on top of the customer experience not only for us but for the entire dinning room. Try the mozzarella stick. Omg amazing. The price is perfect and you get an amazing amount food.   Love it."}
{"text":"Just finished having my birthday dinner here.  My boyfriend ordered the NY combo pizza & I ordered a pasta dish w/chopped clams and shrimp over linguini...DELICIOUS!!!!  We will definitely be back! The restaurant was also well lit, we could actually see the menu to read it w/o having to use the lights from our phones.  Service was great & prompt.  Can't wait to get to work tomorrow to brag about it.  100% recommendation."}
{"text":"Always delicious. Have never had a bad meal here! My daughter wanted her bday dinner here and they gave us a big side room all to ourselves... very friendly staff and great pasta dishes. Very glad to have this option in N Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The things I did like about this place was the flavor of the food and the service which was efficient. I found that our waiter though nice, but rather unknowledgeable about any of the dishes and could only recommend the popular ones. We ordered the clams and mussels to start and both tasted great but I really felt that for the price, the portions were very small. We then ordered a pasta seafood dish that was also very good tasting but again,for the price, I also found to be on the small side. We finished by ordering the brownie and creme brûlée  both of which were just okay. Overall I would like to go back but won't because the atmosphere, service, location and portions just don't add up to there pricing."}
{"text":"The food here is unbelievably nasty. I thought it had good reviews, nice pictures of various food, and an appealing menu. It was so bad that I wish I didn't have to pay but ended up shelling out $35 for two barely edible pasta dishes. The quality of the food should be absolutely no more than $20 total (and the rest can be a tip for our hardworking server.) I just found several 1-star reviews of this place that are \"not recommended\" for publishing. Yelp should include every one of these poor customers' experiences because we're all getting duped to try this crappy place. My stomach actually feels really sick from eating that junk. Few hours later: thanks for churning out my innards and making me spend a good amount of time at the toilet.  The absolutely worst dining experience of my entire life."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot -- cozy and casual but still has a nice classy vibe.  Extensive menu -- always takes me forever to decide.  Big parking lot. Plus they have a breakfast menu!  Husband and I have been here a couple of times BUT read on...  I'm now a bigger fan and plan to visit more often...  My review here is to specifically commend the staff for accommodating a late-evening post-event celebration for our volunteer organization on 10/14/17.  They stayed open late for us (we booked this ahead of time) and the staff were cheerful and efficient.  Full menu was available even so late.  (I believe they requested that we make our food orders before a certain time, and that was fine -- we all had time.)   Our entire group was quite impressed with their hospitality and plan to make Times Square our regular celebration spot.  We were well-behaved, so I hope they will welcome us back!"}
{"text":"Such a great Italian restaurant! Our family was introduced to Times Square at their Deer Valley location when there was only one location.  We found them on Yelp and happened in there on Valentine's Day several years ago.  Awesome food, and we were thrilled to learn about this location on 7th St. and Union Hills.  It's bigger and just as delicious.  No matter what you get, you can't go wrong.  Everything is delicious.  We frequent this location quite often and are happy to see business is booming.  If you serve great food, people will come."}
{"text":"The waitress/bartender was awesome! I wish I remembered her name. The food is delicious and the portions are HUGE."}
{"text":"Both locations are great but I absolutely love the new one (Union Hills). I don't think I've had a bad thing on the menu and the service is always spectacular. The 1/2 price wine bottles on Tuesday night is definitely something to take advantage of. I don't write many reviews on Yelp.. only do it if I really like or really hate a place. I couldn't resist writing about how great Times Square is!! Check it out! Highly recommend the Pasta Giovani!!"}
{"text":"Visited Time square Neighborhood restaurant and was very disappointed in the willingness to turn away business when they have been open for a few weeks.  My wife and my son were planning visiting and watching some basketball when we were informed that no one under 21 allowed in lounge area.  We were not sitting at the bar but tables adjacent to them.  When asked why that was it was due to a rule made by management of Time Square.  There are numerous great restaurants that don't have the \"Prima Donna\" attitude of Time Square.  I understand that some will welcome the area not be available to children.  What about people like me that want an area where no drunken idiots are allowed but they don't have that yet.  They definitely should not have \"NEIGHBORHOOD\" in their title as I did not feel welcome."}
{"text":"Once a favorite the last five or so times yielded less than stellar results and can't say at this point it's a fluke. I always brought my pizza home and put it in the oven for added crisp which makes all the difference. The one time I ate in it was not at all good. And the last few times I ordered it was downright awful. Seems something definitely changed in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I had the Pasta Giovanni and it was delicious.  But be warned its enough for  two people. We also ordered a cesar salad amd yhst was enough for three people. The marsala my husband had was not good. But i would recommend this restaurant.  Oh, it is a family type restaurant."}
{"text":"Every time we come here the food is great and it comes quick is homemade. Open kitchen is because they want you to see what is going on and it's all good I mean all good"}
{"text":"Adjoins the runway at Scottsdale Airport on the west side, just north of Tbird... Enjoyed an early dinner, got to pick from Italian specialties and standard items, but Oh the taste!  I had the Pollo Marconi, with a tomato cream sauce, covering a lightly breaded chicken breast, with ham and eggplant on top, plus mushrooms.  Served piping hot and fresh, what a great flavor, and presented nicely with a side of pasta.  Spouse had the soup (was A+ in her book) and Penne.  Our server was attentive without hovering, gave good info on the menu and helped package up the leftovers.  We will be back often, great experience  PS, they are also open for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable!!! You gotta go there! Pasta is amazing... service is spectacular!!! Cannoli's are the best ever. Try the pasta Giovanni.. one of our favorites. It's off the beaten path but easy to get to. Off Scottsdale road and Thunderbird. And best of all really reasonably priced!! LOVE!"}
{"text":"The 7th Street and Union Hills location is much better than the one on Deer Valley. It's cleaner, better atmosphere, quieter and has a larger parking lot. The wait staff is also much friendlier. Both locations have very good food but if customer service and atmosphere are important to you, I recommend this location."}
{"text":"My first time trying this place out! Been hearing many great things about this place so my friends and I decided to stop by for some lunch. Turns out their menu is a novel! Lots of choices and their pizza slice are very inexpensive. I got the white sauce clam pasta and to be completely honest it wasn't my cup of tea. The clams were very chewy... I don't know if the clams were supposed to taste like that? Their sauce on the other hand was fantastic. My friend got their other pasta dish and I took a bite a it was so good. The portion is quite allot so if you don't eat that much, a pasta entree can be share for two.   It was around 11:30am and it wasn't that busy! Service here was great and she was very nice to explain some of the food on the menu. I would definitely come back again and give their other dishes a try."}
{"text":"Five of us ate dinner here on a Friday. We all left satisfied. Good food, generous portions and good service."}
{"text":"Great place to eat!  I used to live down the street from this place and even after moving I still find myself back here every now and then.  The staff is really friendly and the food is awesome!  Choice between chicken parm and lasagna.  Both are equally good.  Makes me feel a little like I'm back in NY."}
{"text":"Well my parents arrived from New York and of course this is where they wanted to go. First I want to say the two stars are for Angela and Angela alone. The manager Laney or Eileen left a bitter taste in my mouth. What manager argues with a person about putting Alfredo on the chicken parm sandwich. Telling me I have never gotten it here. Well honey I have. Every time I am here. I told her do you read your Yelp reviews? Because 5 months ago I posted a review on this particular sandwich. Marinara makes me sick and I think I would know and remember that. Sad customer service. I could feel Angela was embarrassed for her. She finally agreed to make the sandwich but made her chefs look really bad by saying she didn't know if they could? Huh? Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that you swap the marinara for Alfredo. I think I am done here. Red Devil is extraordinary compared to this place. Thanks Angela for having my back!"}
{"text":"Great place to have in the neighborhood! Their prices are fair and their food is delicious. My wife and I happily go there once a month or so."}
{"text":"Love this little restaurant! Great variety of yummy Italian dishes as well as all of the staples such as Lasagna, spaghetti, ravioli. Their pizzas are also very good! Large portions- very fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"I live right behind Times Square...literally and my family and I love this place!!!!! The staff is always incredible but beyond their ability to make us feel like we are eating at home in our own kitchen, this is some of the best Italian food Ive had. As I said, my family of 5 comes in or places a to-go order on a biweekly basis and we have done so for about a year now and have probably tried about everything on the menu between the 5 of us and we have NEVER been disappointed, everything is delicious. Last night my son Isaak and I were having dinner just the two of us and I met Faith one of the managers, she is just a doll and so super sweet. If haven't been to Times Square and enjoyed their delicious food and met Faith and her staff of kind and caring individuals... check them out! You wont be disappointed and will gain your new favorite neighborhood Italian joint. LOVE THESE GUYS!"}
{"text":"I truly felt I was in the Little Italy region of SF or NYC, a family-friendly fun atmosphere with lots of cool staff to greet you and help you feel at home. Our server Katie, 2 Saturdays ago, gave us great recommendations and was always attending to our needs and had a great sense of humor and energy. Steamers, Pollo Marconi, and Taramisu were to-die-for. Something about the Pollo Marconi's cheese and eggplant layers rivaled a similar dish at Spago's in Beverly Hills. And the Steamers made you grab a miniature spoon to help collect and savor the remaining sauce on the dish. The whole experience made my day on a hot Pheonix afternoon."}
{"text":"It's an okay place - I don't mind coming here for a drink or two - but that's about it."}
{"text":"I cant believe they opened this right down the block from my office. I will be eating here everyday now. I used to eat at the one on deer valley. I am so glad they built one in scottsdale. My new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"4.5:  Consistency is King in the restaurant world so in that vein, the King is alive and well at this new Times Square.    I've been a frequent customer at the original Times Square on Deer Valley road for the last seven years.  Although in all honesty, I usually get the same thing. Oh, I've tried the pasta (terrific), the pizza (excellent), Happy Hour (awesome value), breakfast (amazing) but my favorite is and probably always will be the Italian Super Sub (or Hot Italian, if you will-not that I am). This is one of the BEST sandwiches in town, stuffed with high quality meats and veggies and it's exactly like the version on Deer Valley.  Not only is the food the same high quality, but the restaurant has the exact same vibe and fixtures as Deer Valley.  It's awesome to see a local restaurant have enough success at one location and be able to have a second one that is about twice the size-plenty of room for everyone so don't be shy.  Great central North Valley location at 7th Street next to Goodwill (used to be an Osco Drug back in the day).  If you haven't been to either of the Times Squares (or as the PetSmart peeps called it, The Truck Stop), you really owe it to yourself to try it.  Fantastic Italian food."}
{"text":"Fantastic pasta!! Such a friendly and welcoming environment in every one of their restaurants. The service is always great and our families always look forward to coming to dinner here. FYI when apple maps inputs the address it takes you to BLK, almost all the way to Scottsdale Quarter which is at least quarter of a mile away from the actual location."}
{"text":"It's been a bit of time since I've been here. Rode there with some friends after a meeting. Food and service was very good."}
{"text":"Ordered takeaway which included calamari, baked ziti, cheesesteak with peppers and onions with a side order of fries. Calamari for $13 tasted like frozen over cooked squid. The baked ziti which is pretty hard to screw up was beyond bland with not enough sauce and they used very cheap cheese because you can definitely taste the difference. The garlic bread that came with was horrible it didn't have that fresh out of the oven taste. My hubby's sub was very disappointing for him, it was very dry and the meat didn't have the juices dripping down like should happen with a steak sandwich. Now as for the FRIES which mind you are NOT INCLUDED WITH SANDWICHES are right out of the frozen aisle at your local grocery store. My hubby said nasty babe try one, I told him he no way in h@ll will I eat one of those!! $40 later & beyond dissatisfied will NEVER NEVER EVER BE BACK & would never suggest the restaurant to anyone!! Save your $$, you may have to drive out of the area for REAL ITALIAN DISHES but you'll be thankful that you did!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service & delicious food. I miss living in the neighborhood. I use to come here at least 3 times a week. Everything on the menus is delicious."}
{"text":"Dinner with my son. Awesome food and service!  Love the fried calamari appetizer. Got to try the Baby Clams Linguini, the sauce is smooth...dip with the garlic bread is just sensational.   I had the Sausage and Pepper on a masala tomato sauce that was savory and sweet."}
{"text":"I'd call this a mini Bucca di Beppo. You know so when you sit down and are given pre-wrapped silverware. They served us our salads after a 20 minute wait, then showed up before we even took our first bite with our entrees. I look at them and said \"ah no, I hope those aren't ours\". They then put them up under heat lamps and then came back trying to reserve them to us 10 minutes later. I questioned them if they had been sitting under the heat lamp and was told no. It's not good to lie to your customers when they are sitting right in front of the open kitchen. Don't recommend at all."}
{"text":"This place is always great every time! Finally decided to do a review.  Our favs are the chicken parm and ravioli.   The marinara sauce has such a great flavor. Luv the big piece of garlic bread you get.  The service is always fast and curteous. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The ultimate in neighborhood restaurants! Friendly service, generous portions, very good food, fun happy hour. I have ordered to go, enjoyed a fun filled happy hour of regular  hard working folks who are regulars or new but welcomed. You won't feel alone or awkward here. The Lasagna is great. Pizza too. And during happy hour at the bar a pizza slice is a dollar.  Other choices are as reasonable and just the thing to handle the hunger after a day at work. Lots of authentic Italian choices. If their garlic bread was better I'd have given this place five stars. But again it's just the place to relax and unwind with good friends and good food and drinks."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here. It's off the beaten path, has fantastic service, it's fast, authentic, and delicious."}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate at Time Square Neighborhood for the first time yesterday, we highly recommend it! The food was amazing, our server was exceptional and the ambiance was fabulous!"}
{"text":"I too went to this place expecting the old New York's Best Bistro to still be on premises - but said what the heck, I'll give it a shot.  I wanted a slice of pizza with sausage & pepperoni, but the waitress said I could have one or the other, but not both ingredients.  I watched the chef assemble a plain slice of cheese that was partially baked add the sausage and put in the oven.  Now I'm mad.  I asked the waitress what would have been so difficult about putting the pepperoni on the slice as well.  She said, \"That's just the way the owner wants things done - less confusing.\"  Holy cow, don't order a Screwdriver, they might accidently bring a wrench."}
{"text":"Time Square offers consistently good food and service at both locations.  The Union Hills location is more open and offers a better seating, but could have benefitted from a better location.  I have eaten at the Union Hills location three times and have twice been disturbed by screaming children.  I frequently eat at the Deer Valley location which is busier and still loud but has more polite clientele.  Bring earplugs and enjoy the good food!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing, especially for the price. Atmosphere leaves a little to be desired, especially for a new restaurant. But the service rocks. Looking for a great family restaurant in the north valley? This is it!"}
{"text":"I brought my sister and her boyfriend here for their first time.. I had been to the deer valley location with my parents so I thought we would give this location a try. Well, our experience was not very good. Our server Damion seemed friendly enough when we first sat down.. But apparently we were mistaken. We received our food from a food runner, and he hastily set our food down and ran off... While we sat there for a few minutes with no silverware.. Damion never even came over to see if we even received the right food, let alone see that we didn't even have silverware. We had to flag him down and ask for silverware. He came back and set it down, but again never even checked up on us.. Or asked how our food was. At the end of the meal we weren't asked if we wanted dessert or if we needed anything else. We weren't asked if we beefed boxes. These are just basic duties of a server..... Anyways.. The food was good I would probably be back just hope for better service next time"}
{"text":"As someone who frequented the Deer Valley location, I was ecstatic when Times Square opened a location across the street from my house!   I try to come here at least a couple times a month, because I'm always craving their delicious food. I'm never let down when I dine at this restaurant.   Food is outstanding, along with the customer service.   Try coming in for breakfast also, because it's terrific!! There is something for everyone to like here.   Prices are reasonable, service is friendly, and the food can't be beat.   Welcome to the neighborhood, Times Square, you're an excellent culinary addition!"}
{"text":"I have heard several times from different people how great this place is...i didnt really get it.  I was hoping for a local italian restaurant with amazing food for great prices and that is not what i got.  The pizza was doughy and bland.  The crust had a strange flavor to it also. The service was fine, my only complaint is the food.  i had the fried cheese as well and same thing....it was barely melted and just didnt have hardly any taste."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing and the presentation as well! The staff was very polite and tentative. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Hidden in the Scottsdale Airpark, this casual family owned restaurant will rock your belly with great food!!  If you haven't been, it's a must!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Spinach Linguini (take out)... this dish was nothing but linguini and a few pieces of spinach and maybe 3 small pieces of chicken.  I'm appalled the cost ($13.95) of this dish considering it was only pasta.  The only reason this review gets two stars is because the flavor was decent.  This is our second time getting ripped off by Times Square! We were willing to give them a second try but regret it.  WE WILL NOT BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Tried the union hills location this time.    Again coming from Boston,  hard to find good Italian.   This is the closest decent Italian compared to the north end,  Boston.   This location, union hills, is different than the deer Valley one.   The 2 dishes I get at deer valley i think is better (shrimp puttanesca and clam sauce) than this location, but still good.  The pizza at the deer valley is pretty good...haven't tried it at this location.  Terrible garlic bread...it's like olive garden...on sub rolls...at least use Italian bread and real garlic and butter.   Like the atmosphere here better and less crowded,  but of course,  it's larger for seating.  Waiters are always nice."}
{"text":"Such a fabulous experience  Went for bteakfast and the owner told us we could order anything  Only one of us ordered breakfast.  I had shrimp fra diavlo WOW yummmy  Service WAS SUPERB    GOING BACK TOMORROW"}
{"text":"THE best Italian food in the north valley. Sauce is just like grandma used to make. Food is consistently terrific as is the service, Renée is awesome and such a pleasure."}
{"text":"Always great! My husband and I used to go to the location off Deer Valley, but this location seems to be less busy. Food is always amazing, as is the service. Even on a busy Valentine's day, the wait staff was amazing, attentive and could make light of a hectic situation. Their bruschetta is amazing, as is the gnocchi and chicken parm! Love that the kitchen is open, makes it a little more casual but still date-night worthy!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. We loved it when it was New York's Best. Our visit to Times Square was the Worst. Dining. Experience. EVER. I rarely complain about service but this was terrible. Bartender was sweating and gross as he brought over one our our martinis. He also carried it by the rim. Yuck! Unkempt and useless waitress. Four of us had dined that evening. Had to find her for one of our drinks that was taking forever. Then had to go find her for 2 of our dinners that had been waiting under a heat lamp while our other two diners were half done with theirs. Two said their food was mediocre and two of said it was excellent. Cheesecake was disappointing. We will NEVER return."}
{"text":"Simple menu, good food.   Always try breakfast here.  Their hash browns are crispy good!    The Italian meals are hearty, fresh and filling   We go once a month; breakfast is our favorite and the chorizo is nice and non-greasy!     Coffee ...meh.  But your cup is always full and the staff is never less than friendly.    Never been disappointed; super happy for their successful expansion!    Congrats."}
{"text":"Just not that good. Expensive for a typical home cooked meal that you can make yourself. The floors, tables and walls are dirty. Not my cup of tea!"}
{"text":"This place is a *GEM*  Do yourself a favor and become a reg. Great place for a business meeting or to meet the wife or family for a nice dinner or weekend breakfast.  MY LIST: *You can get breakfast here at 7am Appetizer: Fried Calamari (served w/ lemon and marinara) Lunch: Cheese Steak Special (peppers, onions, mushrooms w/ ribeye steak) Dinner: Linguini w/ Clams (light and tasty) Dessert: Homemade Bread Pudding (omg)  ALSO: Brunch, Bloody Mary + Mimosa"}
{"text":"I really like this place; the staff is friendly and quick plus it's not far from my home so that's a bonus for me. We went here last night with friends for happy hour. They have several food and drink specials plus you can get a slice of cheese pizza for $1 (pepperoni, sausage and margarita are also available for an extra charge). I ordered a slice with onion and they did make it for me, but apparently they don't offer any other toppings other than the ones I listed so just keep that in mind.  Another thing to keep in mind, that I wish they would have noted some place or at least told us about before ordering, is that they only give 1 happy hour food item/drink. I found this annoying since 2 slices of pizza and a beer was a great meal and a deal but when we got our bill we questioned the prices and at that time we were told about the policy. That lost this place a star. Hey, I get it, it's a good policy to have but customers who are clearly there enjoying happy hour should be told this PRIOR to placing additional orders. Plus apparently ordering a bottle of wine during happy hour doesn't count as more than 2 drinks? I'm pretty sure a bottle holds 4-5 glasses of wine so again, I do not approve of this policy. If 4 people had shared that bottle would that have been 4 drinks? Anyways... it's still a good place to checkout regardless of this recent annoyance."}
{"text":"I eat dinner here a lot with my toddler son. Slices of pizza are $1.50 so I don't have to flip out when he decides he won't eat it. The staff is amazing. (Very nice in a friendly comfortable way )  I tried the bloody  Mary build your own bar this morning and I liked it. Not fancy but decent and close to home. The salad and pasta dishes are priced too high for the quality coming in at around $15 so I stick to the pizza."}
{"text":"This restaurant made my son's birthday party a hit! The catering order was easy and they gave us plenty of food. It was packed well and we were able to keep it warm for the party.  The manager was great to work with and we were even allowed to do a few substitutions to make it what we wanted.  I hope you get lots of new customers because everyone asked me where we catered from.  Two thumbs up for this restaurant! Great food, quality and service!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is my favorite in Phoenix. Every  item on the menu that I have tried has been perfect. Always consistent, no matter what day or time of day. Some of their specials are to die for. If it weren't for calories, I would be there 3-4 times a week. They have like 4 different locations, I have tried  three of them, once again the word is consistency! Same perfect meal each time. Even lunch or just a slice of pizza is as good as I have had anywhere. On a funny note, they are a bit quirky with the items you can put on a slice of pizza. Doesn't make sense, but no big deal. I love this place.  Well managed, good service and amazing food at a fair price. What more can you ask for??  Oh yea, a nice little bar too, perfect for a few cocktails. Very comfortable!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Italian food at local neighborhood restaurant.  Our party of three all ordered different entrees, and we all left satisfied.  Lasagna was our favorite item, followed closely by the chicken parm.  Wine selection is limited.  For the price range, solid choice for an Italian meal in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Real mom and pops restaurant! Reminds me of when my parents would make me super delicious food. They have the best bruschetta, and the most amazing SUPER Philly cheesesteak. The servers seem happy to serve you and usually no waiting time. Been there twice now, and needless to say I will continue these adventures!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad 1 opened in Scottsdale!! I love the food it is all Super delicious! Great service and always friendly! So many options from pasta, pizza, salads, chicken plates and the mussels soooooo good! We'll definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"I get the pasta delivered by door dash like once a week since I discovered these guys. The food is absolutely delicious. I like the Alfredo with shrimp, my wife likes the pasta Giovanni. Yesterday door dash was down so I drove down there and got great service, and the view watching the private jets flying in was cool. It's a little tough to find, but totally worth going. They have a full bar too and good desserts. They have three locations in the valley, try them."}
{"text":"Listening to Beethoven Symphony No.7 in A Major on a lazy Friday night I was inspired and overwhelmed with hunger. Like a madman I started my quest for food that will not just make my evening but make Beethoven proud. Being a food junkie I needed my fix and I needed it in that very moment. Luckily for me my revelation was around corner called Times Square Neighborhood Restaurant located at 718 E. Union Hills Dr. Phoenix, AZ 85024. How good was the food and what does the restaurant have in store for everyone? Let's go on a journey and find out. First, walking toward the door of the restaurant I was floored with excitement when my nose picked up smell of food being made inside. Like African Drums in the jungle I could hear the beating louder and louder as I was coming closer to what my nose identified smell of Alfredo. Next, I was greeted by lovely young lady and escorted to round small table located in middle of the restaurant. Whoa! What a cozy little restaurant cozy and classy.  Nevertheless, I was here on business not just pleasure and my eyes were focused on the menu like a hawk. But there were quite few of Italian signature dishes including my favorite \"Fettuccine Alfredo\" priced at modest $12.95 ($9.95 without chicken). I completed my order at the spot and also placed order for glass of Merlot. So far so good, but can this restaurant not only deliver but exceed my expectations? Now one of interesting facts about Times Square restaurant is that I could not hear any music it was obvious this restaurant was aiming for a different type of dining experience without distractions. Experience long forgotten when we all used to sit down at dining table and socialize with friends and family while going over our day.   Consequently, one of my favorite reasons why this restaurant stood out was how kitchen was integrated with the diner. How often do we see environment where the guest can watch the kitchen staff prepare your food? I appreciate the transparency and authenticity this restaurant has with its guests making dining a more intimate experience.  Finally, the moment came we have all been waiting for as my Fettuccine Alfredo was making its way to me. After brief visual and mouthwatering observation I dug in the plate. The sauce had a scintillating effect to my typically bored taste buds arousing them with excitement. Chicken was deliciously marinated bringing out the natural flavors effortlessly. The Alfredo sauce felt authentic with right ratio of garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper and a dense creamy and cheesy Parmesan texture making this a culinary retardation of senses. My mind almost ceased to function but those are some of life greatest moments when we lose ourselves and all control. I can highly recommend this restaurant to all food lovers and those spiritual foodies enjoying many complexities this restaurant has in store."}
{"text":"5+ if possible!!!! Amazing! This is like you're in a small Italian kitchen in NY! You have to walk in and just order! The linguini aglio e olio is AMAZING!! The service is AMAZING! Marinara was wonderful! The dessert was all homemade and beyond incredible!  They are serious when they say \"you walk in as a guest and leave as family!\" A++++++"}
{"text":"Very good food and the service was great. We had crab cakes for an appetizer and they  were good. I've had better...in Maryland. For dinner I had the veal picatta. It was very good and they were generous with the capers. I will return here for sure."}
{"text":"As a mother of a child with Celiacs, my only complaint is there isn't a \"gluten free\" option here. And I REALLY wish their was. Because, I loved their food!  The entree we ordered was delightful, full of flavor and just enough for 2 people to share. We got the calamari for appetizer, and again weren't disappointed.  Lastly, we enjoyed a creek brûlée and fell head over heals for the rich, sweet, amazingly good Italian dessert.   It's a cozy little place, nothing to fancy. Perfect for a dinner out with the kids."}
{"text":"We love this place... and the prices are excellent. Homemade salsa is AWESOME..."}
{"text":"I used to absolutely love the Italian place that used to be here!! Called to make a Valentine's reservation and realized new ownership had taken over. Made dinner reservations for 7:30 (\"oh that's a great time\" I was told). Showed up a couple minutes early and were warmly greeted and immediately seated.   And then we sat. And sat. And sat. For 15 minutes we were not even acknowledged! There were 4 other tables on the patio and we watched the server (bald guy, I'm assuming the only one on the patio) open a bottle of wine, personally deliver an appetizer, and go behind the bar to fill waters for, alas, every table but ours. A \"hello, so sorry, I'll be with you in just a few minutes\" goes a long way, just FYI!   We were prepared to order cocktails and apps right off the bat but instead turned hangry and decided to leave (all still without being acknowledged at all).   Really wanted to like this place! However after this experience, we will rely on the many other wonderful, local Italian joints in the neighborhood, who are tried and true."}
{"text":"Can I give a 5 star plus? Delicious. Need I say more. Staff is so friendly, they make you feel like family. The atmosphere is casual. Everyone from restaurant staff to patrons were smiling. The food was outstanding. The Cesar Salad had the right amount of dressing and homemade croutons. I had the special which was grilled salmon over couscous. I generally don't care for couscous but if I could have licked the plate I would. It was stupendous. Cherry tomatoes, golden raisins, onion and pine nuts. OMG I died and went to heaven."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Italian restaurant with fantastic food and service!   Authentic Italian food served in generous portions.   Very attentive staff.  We had spaghetti and meatballs, tortellini and penne arrabiata.  Fresh garlic bread and cannolis were decadent."}
{"text":"Tonight I ordered takeout through postmates, gnocchi with marinara, a side of meatballs and a side salad. The gnocchi were fine, but had the wrong sauce, vodka sauce (or some kind of orange cream sauce} rather than marinara. This was super disappointing as the entire reason I ordered Italian food was bc i was craving red sauce. The sauce was pasty and not all that good. I thought the meatballs were seriously under-seasoned. The sauce that came with the meatballs was much better than what was on the pasta, but still not great. I definitely won't be ordering again and was unhappy that my ordered wasn't even correct. Why is it so hard to find decent Italian food in Phoenix?"}
{"text":"All 3 courses were delicious! Staff was friendly. Atmosphere is a little confusing... Italian/sports bar and grill?"}
{"text":"We continue to enjoy Times Square - it's been well over a year since I wrote a yelp review about this location and we've been here at least once a month since then and we enjoy it every time.  We started bringing family from out of town here when they come to visit and they always request to go back.  My dad loves their linguine with clams - he claimed he wasn't hungry and then proceeded to eat the entire plate of food because it was so good.  We have also recently discovered they make amazing french fries.  Not exactly what you'd think to order at an Italian restaurant but they're seasoned and amazing and if you order fries you get a huge basket of them.  My husband orders them every time we eat here now.  My new favorite dish is the gnocchi.  I have been ordering this for the past 5 or 6 visits and it's delicious. Staff is great and attentive and food is really good!  We love this place!"}
{"text":"Addie needs to find a new restaurant - Times Square is out of her league and TS does not need her nonsense   TS is a great  Arizona restaurant -- with great Italian food !!  Addie-- stay at Denny's or IHOP !!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! Oddly located in a strip mall, its very unassuming but the service was great and the food was fantastic!! Large portions so expect some leftovers, or perfect for sharing too. I tried the chicken parm and had to fend off my husband because it was so good and he wanted it too LOL"}
{"text":"Just ate with family at the new \"Times Square Restaurant\" and it was amazing. It is located right by the Scottsdale Airport at 13901 N. 73rd street. Love this hole in the wall location an the food and wine was amazing. If you enjoy red wine their house red is fantastic. Great flavors and huge menu you with portions that will give you a couple of meals afterwards. To say this is  highly recommend is an understatement. Fun to go before it is discovered. Just opened. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. Breakfast is cheap! French toast, 2 eggs, bacon....$4.99"}
{"text":"It's a fairly new place, so I think the staff on the phone doing  to-go orders are still getting in the swing of things. (I usually just do take-out there) they're always putting me on hold to ask questions about their own menu... but I LOVE the food. The Pasta a-la-vodka is my favorite. But today I ordered the Chicken parm sandwich... AMAZING. The bread is crispy and delicious! I go to dine in at their 24th ave and DV location and the service is AMAZING along with the food. The food is VERY consistent at both Times Squares!"}
{"text":"I had lunch with one of my Co-workers here. It was my first time. The food was okay. The music didn't match the restaurant theme so it made it awkward. The service was super slow. I will definitely not recommend this place. It was definitely not a friendly environment at all."}
{"text":"Was looking for a good place to meet my family halfway from Glendale and decided to try out Times Square due to low prices and good sounding stuff on the menu!  I feel pretty neutral about this place. I wouldn't really want to go back, but i wouldn't refuse to come back. It was pretty empty when we went, probably because it was a Monday morning! Was not really a fan of the decor, it reminded me of old people . But that isn't really important! The service was not bad either.  I ordered a Spanish omelette with rye toast and home fries. They gave me hash browns instead with my omelette, I told the waitress and it took quite a bit for the home fries to come out, by the time they were ready I was pretty much done. Also I ended up liking the hash browns better, but it was good she corrected that. The omelette was just ok. Didn't like that they had the cheese on top of the omelette, cheese belongs inside an omelette haha. Home fries were meh, hash browns were the best part by far. My sister also let me have a few bites of her pancakes which were pretty good.  Also was not too pricey and the portions were good which was an advantage. Just was not a memorable restaurant. Food was ok, not amazing. Look was kind of drab. Service was pretty good. Overall ok, not great not awful."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Not a bad spot for a quick dinner if youre looking for a good hole in the wall alternative to an applebees or chilis.  Theres a good number of menu options and it gives off a little NY vibe."}
{"text":"So this place is awesome. The food here is great. I get the Philly each time I go here and have never been disappointed. The star rating would be a 5 but the price (over 8 bucks for a sandwich) got it 4 stars. Don't get me wrong the food is awesome even for the price. The service is also friendly and nice. The staff greets you quickly and your food arrives on fast and hot."}
{"text":"The food was SOOOO good. Marinara is the best anywhere. Chicken Parm was delicious. Sad we didn't have room for desert. Anthony was our server and made the experience quite delightful. Patio was clean and beautiful."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast, lunch and dinner. Great place for business meetings, date nights, or family gatherings. They have side rooms which can accommodate quite a bit of people. The service is always friendly and fast! Will return every chance I get!!!!"}
{"text":"Times Square  a hole in the wall that actually delivers some really good Italian food. The prices are jut right for the portion size.  I personally love Fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp. It's a great dish and I highly recommend trying it."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with Glenn and Mindy. This little place has been around for years. New location opened in west Phoenix. Everything you order is made fresh, no canned or frozen. The cannoli was the best I have ever had!  The balsamic chicken was cooked perfectly and the glaze very tasty. I need to go back and have the eggplant it looked wonderful. Or even just to have another cannot!"}
{"text":"This place used to be fantastic. Not anymore, since new ownership took over. I'll try to make this short and sweet.  The food was pretty good. Not great, but not bad. It used to be much better. The thing that really went downhill was the service. We stopped in for a quick bite to eat at dinner. We didn't have a lot of extra time but we wanted a good meal.   Due to our lack of time we decided to skip getting any type of appetizer, drinks, or dessert. We didn't think this would be an issue, but our server was not happy about it and made it known. Obviously in his mind this would affect his tip. When we told him we were going to pass on the extra items, we ordered our dinner items and then proceeded to ask us if we would like to choose between a soup or dinner salad. We were pleasantly surprised because it was our understanding these were not included with the meal (which they weren't, we came to find out).  We chose the salad and when we got our bill at the end of the night, each salad was $5. It really upset us that he phrased it in a way that would make us believe it was part of the meal or included, like some restaurants do. He did it because we didn't order anything extra and wanted a bigger tip. Who does that?? We won't be coming back. Needless to say the tip was minimal."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area from central Phoenix and prefer to patronize local businesses rather than chains whenever possible.    We were greeted warmly and enthusiastically by the hostess and shown to a booth.  Our waitress was L***. Her white shirt had seen better days and looked overall dirty/dingy.  She was not the most personable of waitresses as she didn't introduce herself or tell us her name until I asked.  She was very brisk and none of the usual \"your welcome\" after a thank you or other niceties that I would expect from a waiter or waitress.  It wasn't just us as I overheard this demeanor with other customers as well.  We ordered a bottle of wine and it was very good. My husband ordered the chicken parm but felt that it was just \"OK.  The sauce tasted like it was out of a jar\".  I ordered the Pollo Marconi on the suggestion of our waitress and ate about 1/4 of it.  The eggplant was breaded and soggy.  The chicken was cooked well but I felt like the sauce might have been out of a jar.  The one and only time we were asked how the meal was, I told the waitress and she obviously had no training on how to deal with unfavorable feedback.  I wasn't mad or upset as the eggplant could have just been my personal taste and I stated this.  After this, we got NO personal service....just the check with no questioning if we wanted dessert or not.  When we arrived, I had PLANNED on getting dessert.  We sat at the booth near the station where the servers do their side work (rolling silverware, etc.). The brownies were under a domed lid but after seeing the lid with all of the fingerprints and other things dripping down it (despite having a handle on top of it by which to lift it), I decided against it.  Having the waitresses rolling silverware and drying it after coming out of the dishwasher in this precise location of the restaurant adds to the noise level, makes conversation difficult and is not the most professional.  The owner (wearing a black and white top) spent most of her time with a table of customers that she and a few other wait staff obviously knew.  If we had been asked how our experience was, I would have gladly shared the details rather than writing this review.  I also didn't feel like the feedback would have been received seriously due to the fact that when we were first seated, there was obviously a large party coming in and she was very confused about which staff members were covering which sections and even said \"I'm so confused.\"  If the owner is confused and doesn't lead well, the staff is not going to magically figure it out on their own.  If we had received some sort of \"I'm sorry\" or \"let me get my manager for you\" from the waitress or a \"how was your dinner\" from the owner (who argued with the couple behind us about having marinara sauce on their side of spaghetti rather than the picatta sauce to match the main entree) ..... then we might give this place a second chance.  I would rather drive to our fave local Italian place, Pino's on 3rd Street and Thomas - at least there we have good service and the food is ALWAYS delish!"}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner, fabulous service, dessert (creme brûlée) was so good I didn't want to share!  The Sangria was the best I've ever had.  Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I have been dying for a Tiramisu! From anywhere, really... After our some what disappointing dinner, we jumped to this nice and cozy little place next to the one we were before and we were surprised. Good atmosphere for a Saturday night, clean and neat, great welcome and just overall \"good vibe\" place.   But like I said earlier, we were here because I needed Tiramisu! We just looked through their dinner menu and ordered 2 glasses of wine, I did the Merlot for $7 a glass and it was decent, my husband had the Super Tuscan blend, $8 a glass.   The dessert was delish (or I was just wanting it too much) and the wines were nice. The bartender was friendly and talkative. We'll be coming back soon, for sure!"}
{"text":"Another great dinner experience with my honey. Food was excellent. Joes Special is a chicken dish with garlic and oil spinach. My wife also got a chicken dish with linguini which was also delicious. We also had bruschetta for an appetizer and that was the best we ever had."}
{"text":"From all the Italian restaurants my appetite has taken me to I knew something was missing? Appreciate all the regional Italian foods, but I was on the look out for some good ole NY style Italiano !   Luckily enough I found this place by a simple search online and being located in the north Phoenix area was close to my home. Once we walked in we were greeted by the hostess and chase our server was pleasant and outstanding with his service . We started with a martini and a Mediterranean Mule (fig vodka & ginger beer). Went off the starter menu of the calamari dish which had amazing fresh texture , combined with some homemade tomato sauce. The main dishes of Giovanni pasta (penne pasta, sausages, chicken, mushrooms) and the Manicotti( ricotta and spinach sauce melted with mozzarella cheese ! Overall the best and I mean the best locally owned Italian restaurant in town!"}
{"text":"The last time I was at Times Square it wasn't the best, so when my friends said they are headed back there for a birthday dinner celebration I was very tempted to just say I can't join you, but I didn't and set off to meet them on a Sat night.  We were a party of 8, and I have to say, service was delightful, I wish I remembered her name, she was quick witted, polite and just fun to have around, she made sure our cups were always filled and that we didn't want for anything.  After checking out the menu, I went with the Fettuccine Della Casa, it was fettuccine noodles in a white creamy sauce with mushrooms, peas and bacon, and let me tell you, even with the peas, this dish was delish! I almost licked my plate clean haha. So good!  For dessert I went with the Cream Brulee, I don't know about you, but I live for the sound of the sugar cracking and that's exactly what this did! Perfectly browned sugar and great tasting vanilla custard, I do love a good Cream Brulee!   Happy this turned out to be a good evening!"}
{"text":"This is a family oriented pasta place. At first it looks like it lacks potential due to the location in between a Goodwill and a terrible gym in a strip mall, BUT, the food is superb and the portions are stifling. The service can have it's hiccups, but is still great overall. It is definitely a fork wrapped in a napkin with band around it type of place, but the laid back family nature of it along with the food make it all a great time. I keep repeating family because it's the type of place folks schedule a post season soccer team gathering or a school function.  All in all nothing bad to say about this place. It has a loyal following which to me speaks volume. Give it a try and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this hidden Gem! Grier the bartender us the best! We sat at he bar and tried several things.. The wings, Bruschetta and streamers ... They were all top notch"}
{"text":"This place lost two new customers due to a lack of accommodations for very simple culinary exchanges. I mean c'mon! you are an Italian restaurant. Adding a protein to an existing dish and switching out a few ingredients cannot be that hard for your simple minded kitchen. I worked in many styles of service with many different types of food and never had an issue like this. Way to lose out on a customer before they even in your door. Off to Joey's Bistro it is"}
{"text":"My husband and I order from here a few times a month. We love their pizza. They have great dinner entrees as well. However, if you call in an order for pickup, make sure you get the order taker to repeat the order. Last night we got take out and the girl at the counter messed up our order. This has never happened before so we didn't get upset. It was a young girl and it seemed like she might be new. Other than that, the food is great and service is unusually wonderful."}
{"text":"It's not bad just for my point of view I could make better food at home,plus the prices are outrageous for the small food you receive. Also don't do take out they forgot to pack your food so always check for pick u don't assume everything is all there."}
{"text":"Holy. Pasta. This place has amazing food. Both of the dishes we ordered were amazing, and didn't break the bank. What a great find!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!   The meat ravioli was great!   Tomato sauce was  flavorful.   Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place. Has been our go to spot for work meeting for a while. They always are very accommodating and take care of us. Sometimes we come in with no notice and they still get us sat in a timely matter. The food is great!!! Appetizers are amazing, really like the calamari and fried mozzarella!!! They lady that is usually at the bar is a really down to earth and always happy. I have yet to try the new one in Litchfield Park but will be soon!!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing like a local family owned Italian place! They serve breakfast lunch and dinner here and it's all good! Recent visit with a friend who had never been before was better then ever. Homemade gnocchi very flavorful and garlic bread perfect. Huge portions for leftovers the next day. Since turning on my friend with this local find she has been back once or twice already. Well worth the prices and friendly service."}
{"text":"Food is amazing!  However,  our service tonight was terrible! We had Damian and he was not friendly,  never refilled our drinks, kept walking by us but didn't stop to see if we were  doing alright, etc. Just acted like he wasn't interested in providing good service. The manager even walked by SEVERAL times, looked at our table with empty drinks and dirty dishes and kept walking.  The last time we ate here our waitress Grace was awesome! Stellar service and care for the customer! For the price of the food and drinks here, you would expect better service!"}
{"text":"Went there for a late lunch today first timer. Not crowded service was great and The food was better. We had calamari Cesar salad and Penny pasta with sausage and chicken. Will definitely be back. The menu was huge and food was very fresh garlic bread was delicious"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar on a Thursday evening after work during happy hour and it wasn't busy at all.  Maybe due to it's location or the fact that it's still really new in the shopping center.  It's very nicely decorated and spacious once you walk in, sort of unexpected because of the shopping center itself.  Service was prompt and friendly!  I ordered a glass of Jellybean red wine blend to go with my Balsamic Chicken with sauteed spinach.  I had a hard time choosing between the Balsamic and Joe's special, which looked to be very similar on the menu.  The Balsamic was great, seasoned a lil strong, but still really good.  It came with two chicken breasts, a lot for me, so I took the second to go.  I'll definitely come here again to try Joe's special among other things like the bruschetta and pizza!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I really like this place. Not only is it in a convenient location for us, but they also have really good food for great prices.  Their Margarita pizza is my absolute favorite. It is so flavorful, with tomatoes, basil, olive oil, and mozzarella cheese on a fresh thin crust dough. It is one of the best margaritas I have had in a while.  Last time we went, we also ordered a big house salad to share, which I really enjoyed. The portion was big and the salad was fresh and the dressing was delicious.  We have also had breakfast there and it has been consistently very good.  We have never had bad service there. Everyone is always nice and accommodating. They even let us sit in an area they kind of had closed off for the day. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Owner of this place just so you are aware .. you're loosing customers because of your hostesses .. they have no idea what they are doing estimating 40 min wait times when a whole side room is completely open and we noticed tables open all over even servers were telling them to sit people... other than that everything is great here!"}
{"text":"My office ordered take away breakfast this morning. I ordered the vegetable omelet, egg whites only. Upon receiving my food I had to spend several minutes soaking up the 1/4 inch of liquid my omelet was soaking in. I've been served omelets at truck stop diners that were less greasy. I also ordered the \"half peach\" listed on the healthy menu which, unexpectedly, is not a fresh peach, but appears to have been taken from a jar, or can."}
{"text":"I love this place.   I am here every Monday morning for a networking meeting and the service is amazing and great food!"}
{"text":"We went in on a week day night around 7 or so , walked directly to the bar , a young female bartender was working there and she was relatively pleasant to me , but not so much to my girlfriend Michelle ,  Michelle ordered a Shandy and after some clarification she received one , I ordered a Coors light which were on special for 2.00 , all good , we ordered some calamari as an appetizer , it showed up , mediocre ,,, we then ordered another drink , myself another Coors Light , Michelle then opted to have a Bud Light , and proceeded to order dinner , she chose the Veal , I opted for a salad , a couple of minutes passed and the waitress returned to tell Michelle they had no Veal ,,, which was the sole reason we went there , the waitress apologized and said that they had other options but no Veal , she then said to just cancel everything and we would take the check , the bartender said she would not charge us for the Bud Light and grabbed the almost full glass and poured it down the sink .  I was somewhat taken back , and Michelle was stunned ,,, why offer to buy a drink to just take it away ??? Ultimately ,,, \"One and Done for me with this place ...."}
{"text":"We had driven by this place a couple times and decided to give it a try. We were seated immediately.  Our waitress was very pleasant, knowledgeable, and attentive.  The cheesy garlic bread appetizer was awesome!  So far our experience was great and I was very excited for our entrees!  Then, the entrees came out...  The sauces were tasty, but the food underneath was very bland. I had the Pollo Marconi.  The breading on the chicken had no seasoning and tasted like nothing until I added salt. My son had the Beef Ravioli. The sauce and cheese were excellent, but the beef inside had absolutely no flavor.  My husband had the linguini with white clam sauce, and said it was good after he added a bit of salt.   Overall, it wasn't terrible, but I don't feel like it was worth the price ($61 before tip)."}
{"text":"This place is super good! When I first moved to phoenix I used to eat here all the time! Really good pizza a real unique taste that you won't find anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Amazing 5 star restaurant at surprisingly affordable prices especially in Scottsdale!  The seafood & pasta was fresh & delicious."}
{"text":"Chicken Caeser is delicious. Didn't get past it on the menu when the other three with me all ordered the same thing. Home made croutons. Right amount of dressing. Cozy atmosphere classy enough to be a great date spot! Ample bar area for a restaurant and spacious dinning room. Server Suzy is great will be back and will try something else!"}
{"text":"Great local restaurant. Great pasta and sausage dish. Basic family style Italian place. Good prices and nice staff."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location when it was previous restaurants for a very, very long time.  It has been sold and then rebought many times as well.  This is the first time that I have truly enjoyed the new restaurant that takes over.  We went there today for lunch and had 3 different salads.  They were an extremely generous size and tasted great.  The menu looks wonderful as well.  We will definitely be back and I look forward to it."}
{"text":"We've enjoyed dining at the Times Square Deer Valley location.  We just found out about this location and wanted to give it a try.  Although it appeared they were understaffed, service provided by Mario was very good.  We ordered the Arrancini as an appetizer.  Unfortunately, the center was cool.  When we brought this to Mario's attention, he immediately said he would give us another order and took the charge off our bill.  We were immediately impressed with this level of customer service.  My husband ordered the Scallop Risotto special and loved it.  I ordered the Pasta Giovanni and was not disappointed.  The portions were large and very flavorful.  We did notice that other tables had garlic bread but none was brought to ours...not that we needed it, but noted the oversight.  The three servers were really moving servicing a full outdoor patio and about 8 tables indoors.  We noted quite a few orders for take-out pizza and enjoyed watching pizza dough being thrown in the full view kitchen.  We plan on trying the pizza in the future.  We did dine at the previous restaurant in this location and noted that Times Square had expanded dining areas and the patio.  We definitely plan on dining at this location again."}
{"text":"Did lunch here.  Went with the lunch special of a salad and 2 slices.  Great price and got the food fast.  Salad was way bigger than expected and the pizza was very good.  Price was spot on!"}
{"text":"Pasta dishes that melt in your mouth - exceptional sandwiches made to order - wonderful pizza - a wonderful place for lunch or dinner -"}
{"text":"Close and convenient,  this really is a \"neighborhood\" restaurant. I can't recommend anything as spectacular, but our meals have always been plentiful and good quality. Frankly, I am a bigger fan of their breakfasts (maybe because I don't do mornings well and want someone else to take care of me.) Service has always been friendly and efficient and there is a lot of variety at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Time Square, and I could not have been more happy with our decision tonight.  Upon being greeted and immediately seated, the host made a few recommendations and then informed us that our server would be over soon. Less than a minute passed before Caleb approached our table and began to take us through the menu. In all, we took his recommendations (fried mozzarella, pollo de Marconi, and a dish for my wife that he custom made for her. Every single one of his recommendations were spot on to our desires and his vivacious personality showed his passion for the restaurant. The service we received from Caleb and the rest of the wait staff was some of the best service I have seen in a restaurant in Phoenix. We plan on returning soon!"}
{"text":"Great menu, super food, large portions, priced right, good service.  Only one other table of people on a Monday night,  Hope it was a rare quiet night because I'd hate to see them fold because business is slow.  Definitely looking forward to my return visit."}
{"text":"I was not impressed.   I sat at the bar,  service was a little slow getting to me.  I ordered coffe and asked for cream and did not receive a spoon or stir stick.  She comes back and takes our order.  We aske for a refill and she gives me the bottom of the coffee pot that only filled my cup half way and she goes thats all you get.  I thought she was joking, nope.  She walked by with a full pot of coffee and walked by, no refill.   After we finshed our breakfast she said something very sarcastic.   We shook it off and she comes back with more coffee and says something else sarcastic.   So if you like you breakfast with a side of sarcasm and no refills, this is the place.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"Had the wings very good spicy and crispy. A friend got a sub sandwich very big portions."}
{"text":"This was the worst Italian restaurant I have ever eaten at! Our Waitress was completely clueless about their wines. When we asked her for a suggestion on their wines, she said she knew nothing about wine. Our Calamari was bland and looked like it was sweating (soggy looking). While my Girlfriend was taking a bite and eating the Calamari, our waitress asked if she could take it away. My G/F just looked at her with disbelief and said \"I'm still eating\". Our garlic bread was bland and the waitress asked, \"Can I take that away, so you don't have to look at it anymore?\".   My Meat Ravioli looked and tasted as though they took Chef Boyardee out of the can, put it in a dish and covered it with meat sauce and topped it off with cheese. The Ravioli was literally covered and not visible to the naked eye. It was awful. My Girlfriend had some type of seafood soup with mussels and she said it was bland and average at best.   The ambiance is awful... looks like a Vegas cafeteria down on the old strip. Our bill came to $75! Wow, for that? What a complete rip-off. On the way out (actually couldn't wait to get out of there), I put their business card (I grabbed when I entered) on the hostess stand. One of the 2 hostesses standing there, said \"See you next time\". \"No you won't\", I replied.  My G/F & I have had Italian food in Italy, Grand Cayman, Metro Phoenix and other U.S. cities, and this the worst ever! We like Olive Garden and this doesn't even come close to that. Gordon Ramsey would rip this place to shreds!  Oh, about an hour after I got home, I almost threw up. STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Came here with my whole family for dinner on Mother's Day! What a great choice! We came around 4 pm so it was quite slow but as the evening progressed it definitely picked up in there. It's incredibly hard to find a place for my entire family to be happy with. My father is as picky as it gets, my mom and I are snobs, and to add on to the criteria my brother is vegan (of course)! The staff did an excellent job catering to all our special wants and needs... Bless their souls.   Our server was friendly, on top of it, and NAILED it with the recommendations. We started out with bruschetta for the table (no butter, no cheese). Making these types of changes for my vegan brother usually bugs me like no other, but it was still REALLY good! For my entree, I wanted to try something new and switch it up. The server recommended the Penne a la Vodka. Now, I don't EVER go for a vodka sauce pasta but I decided to take his word. WOW you guys... It's my new favorite pasta dish around. I seriously can't wait to go back and try more things on their menu. This new location is about to grow and THRIVE."}
{"text":"First off, I must admit I am remiss in not Yelping this place earlier.  I've been coming here for quite awhile.  Love the close location, parking, vast menu, and last-but-really-FIRST is Susie. I mostly come here for Susie.  She is an amazing server and I know her days on and off.  I suppose what prompted me to write a Yelp review, after all this time, is the big, verbose note that was/is pasted on the front door when I arrived today.  It's REALLLLLYYYY long.    Note to the manager -- no one wants to stand out in triple digit, humid weather and read the long story.  What it boils down to, is that they are now closed on Mondays.  No big deal!!  Apparently, current economic conditions dictate that being closed on Mondays is the best business decision for right now.  I'm certain you are running off customers and discouraging business with this long, laborious note.  In fact, that is rather proven because someone hand wrote at the bottom of the note, \"We are only closing on Mondays!\".  These are the reasons that employee likely felt compelled to add that statement to the bottom of the tome.  When you post a written diatribe on your door that is that long, people don't read it all and they automatically think:  1. They haven't paid their rent, and the landlord locked them out. 2. The Board of Health has shut them down. 3. They are on vacation, or otherwise, closing for the rest of the summer.  .......and they turn on their heel and leave for someplace else, perhaps never to return.  If you want to keep all your customers, just write a simple note that indicates, \"We are currently closed on Mondays. Thank you to all our awesome customers for your ongoing loyalty.\"  That's it! Make it easy for us, OK?"}
{"text":"Very delicious! Everything we had was amazing ... the fried mozzarella, pescatore, balsamic chicken and last but not least the cannoli!! Best cannoli I've ever had :) The red blend called Tie Dye was also very good. The service was A+ and the atmosphere nice and relaxed. Only thing we would have changed was having a bread basket with olive oil ... have come to expect that when eating Italian."}
{"text":"Our favorite neighborhood spot. Don't tell anybody. I like it low key. Amazing food & great service. Full bar in the back. Good breakfast and even better Italian food for dinner. Hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"The local Italian restaurant has a full bar and nice menu. Afternoon happy hour is only good in the bar area so if you are interested in the happy hour specials sit at or in the bar area. I tried the veal parm and it was over cooked. The food is very average compared to similar restaurants that serve the same type of food."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place because I've heard lots of good reviews. I got the gnocchi which was good, but seemed undercooked. The atmosphere of this place is pretty casual and not for a special evening. It's in a strip mall. My husband didn't really care for his meal and the salads were very basic. My in laws enjoyed their sandwiches, I think it was some sort of steak sandwich. Overall I wasn't very impressed and probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We just bought a house in Moon Valley and was very excited to try Times Square especially to have them as the life long diner. Very disappointed. The service was very slow due to a couple parties. This was the excuse the Manager gave as part of her defense when I asked  for some sort of compensation after waiting for lengthy time for our food. The Manager could not afford an apology or some sort of discount, worse yet she argued \"the food was warm wasn't it?\". My reply was simple, I'm sorry your business cannot afford customer service so we just won't come back here again. To make matters worse she walked away nodding her head NO. When we were still hospitable by paying our bill and paying the tip to the waiter whom was apologetic and walked with integrity she was standing across the restaurant STILL nodding her head NO.   Yelp, do you have a video tape upload option? If so, her reaction was astonishing. Experience never compensates for bad customer service, she may know what she's doing on the job but she forgets who she's doing it for, the customer."}
{"text":"Fried mozzarella is delicious. Great red sauce. Ok Alfredo, only tried it once but it was runny, not my preference. Gotta try it"}
{"text":"Half price bottle of wine Tuesday!  Absolutely wonderful service and dinner. Great location and friendly staff. Just as good as Times Square Deer Valley! Glad I came in!"}
{"text":"Solid food and great service! This is a nice place with a lot of options and reasonably priced. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Really good Italian food. The seafood selection is fresh and delicious. My wife had the seafood Principessa and I had the fresh clams on Linguini. Didn't go five stars just because the service was a little slow, but the food makes it totally worthwhile."}
{"text":"This is a must go place! I have been a regular at the Deer Valley location, and this lactation is just as good. Same great food, and same great people! This location has Moscow mules also! Excellent drink! I have never had a bad item from the menu! I typically get the fettuccine primavera or pollo marconi...been hooked on those ones for a while! Soooooo delicious! The lasagna is great, pasta emiliano, pasta giovanni, rigatoni alla laura...and so many more. You cannot go wrong. Great pizza, and you can order by the slice! Their breakfast is equally as good! Their French toast is my favorite! Save room for their breaded pudding...It is the absolute best! Times square is a must try. Both locations are great! Union Hills is a larger location, but still small and friendly! Come in and try it out! I guarantee you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for the first time and OH MY GOSH. This place is delicious. Their wings are quite possibly the best I've ever had and they also have some killer pasta. Our server Susie was also amazing. As soon as we finished our experience, we both looked at each other and said \"she's the greatest waitress we've ever had!\" We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place after a soccer game with the kids today. It was Delish!  Everyone loved their pasta dishes and boys loved the pizza.  Nice size portions too.  Wish there was one on the east side of valley.  We will definitely come again when we on this side of town again."}
{"text":"There's a secret menu here!  Everyone is super friendly and most patrons are regulars.  We used to eat there a couple times a week because our friends always wanted to meet there."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Italian in the Phoenix area! Everything that we have ordered at Times Square has been amazing. The ambience is not the best but the food makes up for it. The fried mozzarella appetizer is a game changer. I would highly suggest going to Times Square if you are in the mood for anything Italian or pizza!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for great Italian food in and around Phoenix this is the place to go! Each time I have been here I've left happier and happier! The food is excellent! The restaurant is a bit small so plan to go during a not busy time so you do not have to wait."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this opened in our neighborhood! It's in the Goodwill shopping center at 7th St. & Union Hills. We would have completely missed it had we not realized the new \"open\" neon sign. It's very big inside..very deceiving from the outside. Nice choices on the menu too..it's not just a pizza place..pasta, breakfast, and plenty of seating. Nice interior with a lot of seating."}
{"text":"Love Angela!!!. She makes the best orange Julia's.   If you have never had one, visit Angela for brunch Sat and Sun 8am to 1pm.  They also have a fabulous Bloody Mary and mimosa bar and amazing food. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered food to go. I got the new mushroom ravioli and he got a chicken caesar salad. This was our first time here. The food was very good. The only thing I didn't care for was the garlic bread. It was too dense. We will go back. It was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I've been to the 7th St. Location as well as the deer valley location. The new one is much larger and cleaner, but still has the diner feel.    The food is pretty tasty and are very reasonably priced. Although I've tried a few things, my favorite dish has to be the pollo marconi. It has great flavor with a delicious sauce. They also serve breakfast everyday, serving traditional diner eats, like chicken fried steak - I recommend.  Overall decent local place to eat when you don't want to go far!"}
{"text":"Love this place, minimal wait, food is excellent, staff is superb ! Can't say enough !"}
{"text":"We go there so often they know us by name!  My favorite is the creamy A La Laura pasta - really really good - white sauce with zucchini and a lot of garlicy goodness.  All of their pizzas are excellent and made to order.  The fried mozzarella is the best - we always order it when we go.  And... wait for it ... Shea's Dirty Martini's are the best - girl knows how to do it! :)"}
{"text":"I'm going to preface this entire review by saying it was Mother's Day and we were a large party.   Especially because it was Mother's Day, and there were reservations, the restaurant was extremely poorly staffed. They even admitted they were understaffed which makes absolutely no sense because if you have the reservations you know how many waiters & serviced staff you need.   But even if we had good service the food is mediocre. The bacon is OK, the eggs are eggs, the chicken parm was rubber chicken with the red sauce and cheese. There was nothing overly special about this food. It was not home cooked or had a flair of special ingredients or really any passion at all. Again it was very busy and I understand that the kitchen was probably overwhelmed not just by us but by the entire day. So maybe some food got heat lamps for a while and they want to bring out the entire table at once. But when you have 16 people at the table bringing all the food out at once doesn't work. And when some of that is just cold and gross and we have to send food back anyway then bringing it out all at once is moot.  It is entirely possible that you might go to this neighborhood Italian restaurant and enjoy yourself. If you have medium standards for what Italian food should be , then you probably will like the food. They have breakfast lunch and dinner, and it resembles more of an Italian 'Diner',  pulling that term from the East Coast. Most serious Italian restaurants do not offer french toast for breakfast on their menu. So you might see this as a one-stop-shop for many different varieties of food during the day. But the reality is it is not a coveted Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Today was our 1st time here and definitely not our last.  Friendly environment, fresh homemade Italian cuisine, huge portions at average pricing BUT we'll worth it. We definitely will be back!  Thank you Shannon for the great service!"}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of a friend and it was a good one. I had chicken fried steak, home fries and biscuits and gravy. My wife had the French toast and eggs. Everything was cooked to perfection. The service from Kimberley was wonderful. She was helpful and real delight. The manager made two trips and helped with service as well. We'll definitely be making another trip here."}
{"text":"Finding Italian worth eating in north west phoenix is not exactly easy - there are very few spots that offer good quality Italian food - i will say This place is one of them!   I found this place through a best friend of mine and now frequent the establishment often. I love love love there pasta! Its cooked to perfection and there sauces are spot on! Pasta Giovanni is a fave but i also love the Alfredo and there pesto Alfredo - all of there sauces are on point!   There is also Pizza and all the classic favs like lasagna and eggplant parm! They have great appetizers like Italian fried cheese and Calamari - believe it or not there fries are amazing!!!! Ever try fries with red sauce or pesto aoli ?  You should :))) they have killer huge salads as well - i love the tuna salad :)   The service is awesome! Im a bar girl so i never sit in the dining room but the bar service is on point! Especially when Suzy is on Shift - she is friendly and funny and always glad you came :) not to mention how she cares about the little things like Halloween Napkins - that made my day brighter!   Oh yeah! If your into clam chowder they serve it Fridays made from scratch and it is the BEST in the Valley!   Why 4 stars and not 5... Well i don't like there bread. The bread tastes cheap and preservative like - its just not good. I would love if they stepped there game up and tried a better Italian or french bread - i would eat sandwiches then - which they offer quite a few of but the bread is so bad i will not do it as of now.   Overall its awesome - and i love it here!!! :)))"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! They are right down the street from my house and two people can get breakfast for around 10 bucks! I love their French toast breakfast and their biscuits and gravy he or a nine out of 10. Their dinner it is also really good! Customer service is on par and I have never had any issues with any of the waitresses being rude. These guys know what they're doing"}
{"text":"We were looking for something different, and came across their menu. I have to say hostesses was quick, and our server to greet us. The calamari we got as a appetizer, and Wow! We both got our dinner, and great timing too. I have to say this was the best meal we've had in so long. This place you would not normally see, but truly a great hiding amazing food. The cheesecake was the best, and different than typical cheesecake."}
{"text":"I've been to their Union Hills location a dozen times because their food is fresh and great. This was my first time to the SCOTTSDALE location and although the food was par to the other location but what earns this low rating was the service. We had a party of 6 at 7pm on 4/11 for my mother's birthday and it took 30 minutes to get our drinks and an hour for food, including bread.  The place was not busy and their dining room is small, no excuse for the slow service, especially when they knew it was a birthday celebration. Sorry I had to give a bad review but it's what it earned."}
{"text":"Wonderful local Italian eatery.   Good variety menu.  We've tried several entrees and they are all great.   One of our favorites is the pastrami and swiss sandwich.   Best quality pastrami and an outstanding french roll!   All the servers are quite pleasant and efficient.   In short , we love this place."}
{"text":"I wouldn't classify this place as an Italian restaurant.  It is more like an east-coast eatery.  They serve cheese steak and beer and oily garlic bread and chicken wings.  Stuff like that.  My polla al limone was different from how I've had it prepared at actual Italian joints.  The lemon flavor was almost imperceptible, and the sauce more creamy than normal.  Also too much garlic.    They probably don't realize that they are supposed to bread the chicken, and then saute the mushrooms in the same pan with the breaded chicken.  That's how this dish ends up with a \"creamy\" sauce.  The breading sort of comes out into the oil, while the mushrooms let out moisture, and it turns out great when prepared in this manner.  There is not supposed to be any actual cream in it, but Times Square just pours in the cream.  I dunno, I'm just not a fan of really heavy food or sports-bar-type food.  It would be OK if they would market themselves as an east-coast eatery, rather than an Italian restaurant.  Other than that, the prices are normal and the service is good."}
{"text":"hidden from the main road but worth the added time it took to find it.  The waitstaff are inviting and provide great service.  We startex off with the calamari, which i would recommend.  From there I went with the chicken parm sandwich.  I had high expectstions as the peyton manning jingle rsn threw my mind.  Ot did not disappoont tge bread was toasted just right while still being soft inside allowing the sauce to compliment the breaded chicken cutlet.  It was more than filling wothout causing the need for an afternoon nap."}
{"text":"I dined here after my boyfriend had previously brought home a pizza from this same place. We got some garlic bread, which was alright. And ordered the same pizza we had gotten before. As we started eating, I noticed that there was A BUG in the ranch I was dipping my pizza in. I took the bug out and put it on my plate. I showed the server and she went to tell her manager. A few minutes later she came back and told me that their ranch was kept in the fridge, already portioned. Essentially telling me that there was nothing they could do about the BUG that was in ranch because clearly it wasn't THEIR fault that the bug was in my food. The manager did not come and apologize, nor did she offer any kind of explanation. I never even met the manager. They didn't even offer to comp the meal. Needless to say, I did not continue eating after that."}
{"text":"Very unhappy..... wanted a pizza quarter pepperoni and rest veggie... The told me they were unable to do it and that it's there policy. ... really.... policy to tell a guest NO..... are they incapable of doing it? Is it to hard to just put pepperoni on just like 2 pieces worth? Been running restaurants for 18yrs and never heard of telling a custom no when your capable of doing it....wow been going for years hear and there to the Deer Valley location but maybe never again..."}
{"text":"We have been going to TS for over 15 years, first the Deer Valley location, now the location on Union Hills. The food here is homey, simply prepared but consistently good. It's easy to share a meal as the servings are huge. The pizza and wings are my current splurge when we go. The wings are crispy and have a slightly sweet hot sauce. Never disappointed to have leftovers.   We have taken out of towners as well and they have enjoyed it too. It's not high end food, but it is fresh, hot, tasty and service is usually very good. Excited to have it in the area!"}
{"text":"I came her with my father and son for some pizza and (1) cold beer to unwind a busy week. we arrived specifically for the happy hour food and drink price specials. BUT because I had my CHILD with me I was NOT able to BENIFIT from the happy hour specials because my son is not allowed in the bar and happy hour prices don't apply to the family room dining. BS.   we had a Meat Lovers Type Pizza - We requested it be well done, because dad likes it a little crunchy and burnt,.  dough was soggy, drowning in cheese and I am pretty sure not even fully cooked.  also ordered cheese sticks - Real gross, not traditional cheese sticks.  honestly don't even know how to explain them other then clumps of straight cheese.   I will never come here again. manly for the annoying rules about happy hour and the really bad first impression.  ill go to Upper crust on Cave Creek - were they have same type foods, a patio and the wine and beer specials apply to the entire establishment and not just to the bar stools."}
{"text":"1 bartender for 27 people.  A young kid, an employee off the clock cane in and asked an employee, apparently a manager for his tips, and the manager said \"bad time\" and the poor kid left rejected. Maybe his Christmas money he didn't get? Won't be back."}
{"text":"I have to be honest. I didn't expect much from this place located in a busy strip mall but it was so close to my house I felt I should try it. It has become my new favorite Italian place of all time. I've been here at least 10 times and I've never had a bad meal or bad service. The chef even comes out periodically to see how the food is or ask for feedback. And the prices are very reasonable. I will continue coming back as long as things don't ever change."}
{"text":"the food is amazing!!! nice bistro feeling.  everyone is very friendly.  kierland locals should try this place.."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome menu with a nice laid back atmosphere perfect for a family dinner! There pasta options are amazing, not to mention delicious. They also have an open kitchen feature where you can see them preparing your food, and it looks spotless back there! The wait staff is kind and quick, I will be going back there soon."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for something savory so I decided to check out Times Square.   I went with the $10 cheese ravioli and although it was good, it was really nothing special. It was fresh and tasted so, but I've definitely had better Italian food. It came with garlic bread that was a tad too garlic-y for my taste, but the bread was soft and fresh.  I was definitely underwhelmed, but I would dine there again if I ever get the itch for Italian since it's right down the street."}
{"text":"Service and food is excellent,  but the atmosphere and space is drab.  Get napkins that are not like tissue paper. cloth.  Get red and white Italian table cloths and a wicker wrapped chianti bottle with a candle.  Turn the lights down.  Unfortunately this is not place that will be successful unless they up their game.  Why have a TV in in the bar that is not turned on?  Also, the wine pour was the smallest I have seen.  An upgrade to to the wine list would be helpful.  Good luck! In error this review was for the new Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum yum. Prices are good. Happy Hour prices are even better. Food was amazing. We sat at the bar and the bartender was super friendly and attentive. We will definitely go back when we are in the area again."}
{"text":"I do not normally give reviews. I just keep returning to the establishment often if I like it. So good reviews from me would never be seen. So for me to give a review I have to be angry and feel a need to address the grievance. So I have been coming often to Times Square Italian Restaurant and honestly I have liked every dish I have tried Pasta Emilano, Past Giovanni, Scampi Fraviche? or something like that and La Princepesa. I liked the dish this time also it was great. My friend had a problem with his dish and they promptly corrected it with no fuss to more than what I expected service at this point would be good. Being that was the case and I had to wait for my friends meal to come out I mentioned at that time I would just get a dessert when the meal came however the server Julie C. never came back or asked or checked in if there was anything else. Finally came by and when I asked if I could get a dessert said they closed at 10 pm it was a few minutes after 10 and I had been waiting for her to come by and take my dessert order. For this incident I took the liberty to express my dissatisfaction with a low tip of 1.00 as I never not leave a tip. I like the food, my friend likes the place so i will probably come back but I expect at least a reasonable attempt to be made that I have gotten everything I wanted to order. The most effective way to have avoided this was to come by and ask it we wanted dessert as the kitchen was going to close and needed to know so they could have it prepared. I have has better service at a chain establishment that I would rate their food much lesser but I go back there as I am not mistreated customer even if it is close to closing time.  Edited review as email listed on their web site is: Undeliverable: Notice Poor customer service - negative Yelp review  ... This is not looking good"}
{"text":"The waitress and person who seated us were nice and accommodating. We had eggplant parm and lasagna. It was very good. We could taste a hint of wine in the sauce. Very good. We each had a cola. Bill came to $35 before tip. They do have lunch specials that are a pretty good deal. We will go back again."}
{"text":"I had heard just great reviews from friends so I had to try it out.   Unfortunately, my experience wasn't what I was expecting.   I ordered the Calzone and it came out ICE COLD in the middle... so of course I sent it back. The second one I got was just as cold as the first, even though I was reassured that it was cooked. So I eventually had to order something else...  Everyone at my table was completely finished and table cleared before I got my food. I'm usually not too picky about food but because they didn't even offer to comp what I had to wait 45 minutes for...I'll never go back."}
{"text":"This place is about the same distance from our house as the original (which I've also reviewed). Now, it's been awhile since I read that review but I'll bet this is going to sound really similar. First off, the staff is on point. Secondly, while it may be a \"pizza place\" to some, it's not your average pizzeria. Sure, they have pizza but they have a good selection of seafood. Yes, you read that right. They have REAL littleneck clams \"steamers\" (not big ass things that some places claim are littlenecks). They are $11.95/dozen and the broth is delicious, great for sopping up with your garlic bread.   Veal. Tender and flavorful. I think they have 4 variations of it, maybe 5. I ordered that last night (Marsala) and it was great. I didn't even touch the linguine it was served with...which made my server question it. I informed her that I cook pasta all the time, so didn't really feel any desire for linguine, I was just there for the veal. GF went with the Philly cheesesteak (which was a deciding factor on our night out to begin with). Her cabernet was good, my chianti tasted a bit old but I didn't send it back...I just switched to Maker's Mark which paired nicely with the veal.   What sets this apart from the original is the size of it and the relaxing atmosphere. The other one can get filled up on weekends or happy hour and we often feel guilty taking up table space as we linger over tiramisu and coffee or what have you...not here. Without a line forming at the host station in wait...this is much more conducive to relaxing over a few courses and some libations."}
{"text":"Either I ordered the wrong thing or I got Yelp duped on this one. We originally had planned on Mexican for Saturday lunch, but at the last minute my partner changed his mind. I needed to find something different and according to Yelp, Times Square should have been a good choice.  He ordered Fettuccine Alfredo and I went with the Eggplant Parmesan. The Fettuccine was okay, I tried a bite, but the Eggplant wasn't presented well, nor did it taste good. I ate about half of it and decided to call it quits. I make better marinara at home myself.   Overall the service was good, and the restaurant was clean, the food was just a let down. For 40 bucks, with two soft drinks and tip the food should at least be good. This wasn't. Maybe it was me, but it will be a while before I try this one again."}
{"text":"Even before it opened this restaurant seemed odd. The location next to a Goodwill store in a run-down strip mall seemed like an odd choice. Even the name seemed odd for an Italian restaurant that was also open for breakfast, unusual for an Italian eatery. Located where it is it never seemed to be on the way to or from anything so I never had any motivation to go there.    Recently I was meeting up with some people and Times Square was suggested. Did I mention this place is odd? We walked in. No one at the desk. We walk further in. Oh good, a staffer walks right up. She then looks right through us and turns and walks away. We walk up to another staffer and she mumbles something about sitting anywhere while she was tallying a bill. The machine to do that is smack dab in the middle of the main entrance hallway.  Once we seated ourselves a server eventually came over. While slow, the servers actually seem to be pretty nice. We couldn't help but notice a big bearded guy (owner? manager?) with no personality who looked like he was having a panic attack. He stood there and glared a lot. Behind him was the open kitchen with a stack of raw meat defrosting out in the open on the counter. Not appealing. We look at the menu, agree that the prices are surprisingly high considering the location and overall ambience (or lack of it) and decide to pass on ordering food. We had coffee while chatting and left. No \"thank you\" or \"goodbye\" from the nervous manager or anyone else.  Odd."}
{"text":"Love the Gnocchi!!!!! Been here several times and never disappoints. Have been here to just hang at the bar and with a big crowd and service is always amazing. Would strongly recommend this place for the food a lone but the service matches just as much!!!"}
{"text":"Have been to Time Square multiple times and have yet to be disappointed.  The atmosphere is casual but the food is extraordinary.  Suggest you take the recommendations of the servers if you do not know what to order.  Went for my birthday with a friend and had a pigfest...lol.  Started with the fried calimari which was cooked to perfection!  Followed that with a mediterranean salad which was delicious.  Main course was the Chicken Ortega!!  Chicken breast was perfectly cooked and moist!!  Birthday brownie was delicious as is the creme brulee that I normally order.  The manager came over and was very friendly and attentive and explained the bar napkin caricatures on the wall as well as the history of the restaurant.  I will return....often"}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to some good Italian, particularly for me when I saw veal on the menu. Well, that veal parmigiana turned into something ugly. Overcooked meat with way to little sauce and cheese. It was not something I'd want to eat again. The side of spaghetti was sauced the blah tomato sauce that lacked character and meat. The Caesar salad was edible, especially with anchovies (an extra charge), but wasn't great. My wife's eggplant dish was better than the rest of our food. The friends we went with seemed to enjoy their main courses, but they weren't wild about the stromboli they shared as an appetizer. Quite simply the best thing about the evening was the great conversation, and we were thankful that nobody was pushing us out of our booth. In fact, the wait staff were quite friendly, which was the second best part of the meal. Would we go back. Sure, but not with great gusto. Oh, for those who care about such things, I do have to say they served lots of garlic bread. I didn't eat any, but it looked okay, certainly great to fill up the kids, although with the large portions they serve you don't need to worry about filling anybody."}
{"text":"I finally tore myself away from the original location long enough to try this one, which opened about a month ago. I couldn't be happier, this location is everything the first location is, and more! It's bigger, newer, just as friendly and every bit as tasty as the original. Everything from my original review applies to this location: http://www.yelp.com/biz/times-square-pizzeria-phoenix?hrid=rwG7ckwfkDbFWho8-1h-XQ   Thank you, Times Square!!!"}
{"text":"Very good and fresh food. Service is efficient and super friendly. The highlight of my lunch was the cheese steak sandwich special with onions, peppers and mushrooms. The bread was toasted to perfection and everything within it tasted super fresh. The french fries were also to die for. In the past, I have had the chicken piccata there which was out of this world. So much for them calling themselves a neighborhood Italian joint, Times Square is truly a gem and I really enjoy their cuisine that has never missed a beat."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Everything is amazing!!! Best pizza and wings!! Pasta!!! Drinks!!! We eat here once a week!"}
{"text":"I was craving some pizza and I wanted to try somewhere new.  I had been to the other Times Square (Deer Valley) a few times and decided to check out this location.  I called in and placed my order for their carryout special of a 16' One Topping Pizza for $12.00 ($13.00 after tax).  I went with a plain cheese pie with garlic as my topping.  I drove down, walked up to the bar, paid for my pizza and was on my way. Here is how it was.............  Large Garlic Pie-  This thing looked great.  Looked like the same crust and cheese as the other Times Square.  I took a bite in and noticed that it was just a tad \"off\".  They buried the garlic underneath the cheese and right away it tasted different.  Not sure if the garlic cloves they used today were bad, or what?  I know minced garlic tastes a bit strong sometimes, but this was more powerful and bitter than usual.  Besides that, even the cheese didn't taste the same as the Deer Valley spot.  It wasn't as stringy and flavorful.  Maybe I should have went with a meat topping like before?  Who knows?  The crust was pretty good but even that wasn't as great as I had remembered, either!  I ate 5 slices of it and couldn't do anymore.  I gave my remaining 3 slices to a homeless dude on the corner of Bell and the 17 freeway right before I went back to work.  He was stoked!    Overall, the pizza was just meh today.  The service on the other hand was outstanding!  The bartender/waitress lady was very nice and smiley.  She asked how my day was, we talked about the weather etc all while she was getting my pizza and paper plates.  She was incredibly friendly and was the highlight of my visit to the restaurant. She is the reason this is 3 stars and not 2. The pizza though...I'll stick to the one up the road on Deer Valley...much better!"}
{"text":"We won't be back. You'd better like garlic bread otherwise they'll charge you for a single slice. Apparently plain bread \"compromises\" the loaf so they won't substitute regular bread for their crappy stale standard. Server was poorly trained & forgot to replace fork after salad was taken so part of our party couldn't eat when the meal was served. When we asked for linguini to be on side of shrimp scampi we felt like we were being reprimanded when we asked for butter for the dry noodles. Meal was pedestrian at best. Not impressive.  Don't go."}
{"text":"Very nice place. The food was amazing. One of the best Italian restaurants in north Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Eh, nothing spectacular. A little over priced. Tasted ok but made my stomach hurt really bad after eating. No thanks on ever going there again."}
{"text":"I have to go here a least once a week to eat!!!!  THE FOOD IS THAT INCREDIBLE! Every time I go here the food always comes out amazing. My favorite is the Baked Ziti, it has the perfect amount of Sauce and the Cheese is to die for!!! Due to how much I come here and eat I definitely have a favorite waitress! Next time you come in ask for Tina. She is very polite, punctual, and she just has a great energy! STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING GO TO TIMES SQUARE!"}
{"text":"ALWAYS a fantastic meal.    Moreno, the Head Chef consistently delivers a delicious meal!    Complimenting my meal with a glass of wine (which was a generous glass), tonight I enjoyed the Eggplant Parmesan with Angel Hair- delicious!!  We also enjoyed the Pasta Giovanni and Pollo Marconi which were both tasty beyond belief!!    Chris, the server, was attentive and personable.   Great place for either dinner for two or - as we have done in the past- dinner for a large group gathering!   Never disappoints"}
{"text":"The husband heard of Times Square on PBS and I had had it bookmarked for awhile SO clearly we had to visit. This place is nowhere near my house, but sometimes it's nice to get out of the neighborhood. We waited briefly for a table (maybe 15...20 min max). I had to try the pizza because....you know.... pizza... and it was decent. It wasn't mind blowing, but it was good. The real highlight of the night was the tiramisu.... I love tiramisu and this one was worth the calories. Anyway, if I were in the neighborhood, I would come back, but I probably wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Friendly service.  Such a great find. The veal was delicious. My kids loved the spaghetti and meatballs.  A must."}
{"text":"Had a great dining experience at Times Square. Have been here about 6 times and am finally getting  through this very large menu with some favorites.  I had the Pasta Giovanni. The penne pasta has chicken sausage with mushrooms in a tomato cream demi glaze sauce with garlic and red pepper. It was a flavorful dish and had enough left for another meal.  Offspring ordered the Gnocchi. The potato dumplings are hand made and tossed in a maranara creame sauce. Very tasty and very dense. Other offspring had a side ceasar salad with a take home cheese pizza.  Other dishes here have been good. Great for Itallian and seafood. Reasonably priced and great service."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on Sunday. It wasn't very busy. The waitress came to take our order at 1:04pm and said we couldn't order eggs benefits...they stopped serving at 1:00pm. No exceptions and couldn't be bothered to check with the kitchen. Inflexibility is a bad business practice with so many restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"My first time here and was so satisfied and full  we came on a Sunday morning because I saw they had a Bloody Mary bar and it was so awesome. Everything I would want in my Bloody Mary and it was delicious. I had the meatball sandwich and it was delicious. The bread was so fresh. Can't wait to come back for dinner"}
{"text":"Excellent calamari appetizer! Everything we had was wonderful. Our server Michael took care of us very well. The chef/owner Moreno came out to speak to us after the meal and it was very nice. The entrees were all enjoyed, but you should save room for tiramisu and canaloni."}
{"text":"This is a great little family place that you might over look. It's in the middle of a shopping center and probably wouldn't think twice but I'm glad I give it a chance. I had the chicken fettuccini and although the chicken wasn't that great the Alfredo sauce and pasta was delicious! My boyfriend has the spaghetti and meatballs and the meatballs were great. The food was average but the pizza and wings looks really good. I will say I will be back because one thing that definitely stood out was the service. Everyone was extremely friendly and welcoming. They made you feel right at home, you don't see that anywhere anymore. It's the kind of place you can take your family or hang out with friends at the bar and have a good time."}
{"text":"This place is the prime example of Great customer Service! I went on a whim because it's very close to me and I was not disappointed! The staff is very friendly and attentive they refilled drinks/bread before I even noticed I needed any. Once we ordered the food came out within 10min and was delicious! I ordered the linguini with shrimp and clam pieces. And my Bf got a creamy tomato pasta with sausage and mushroom(I can't remember the name) but the dishes were great! This will be my new go to Italian place"}
{"text":"Best Italian I've had in a LONG time. Veal Carciofini was fabulous. Chef Moreno has done a great job. Spinato's, eat your heart out!!"}
{"text":"We come to Scottsdale just about every year and have made a tradition of eating at this restaurant.  I was surprised the find out about the change of ownership.  They have a much larger menu and much more variety.  Most of the meals were good but not awesome.  The shrimp with lemon pasta was missing lemon and had a lot of onions instead."}
{"text":"Well here we are at Time Square Neighborhood Italian Restaurant and this is as good as it gets folks! The food is authentic and the chefs are constantly on top of their game... The fried calamari is the best you'll find away from the coast, fresh and tender. The pizza is amazing to eat in or take out. If you anent tried this place, you really gotta do it... It is just the same as the restaurant on deere Valley. Right at the end of the runway of the scottsdale airport. Very private and secluded. Outdoor seating as well.. Cant say enough good about this place.."}
{"text":"We love the new Times Square!!! The food and service is awesome And keeps is coming back. The new location ROCKS :)"}
{"text":"We were treated to a fantastic meal by chief Moreno and his team. We treated like family and the team took the time to hold a conversation with us and willing to take pictures with us."}
{"text":"I love this place I really enjoy their manicotti and the eggs Benedict on the weekends."}
{"text":"It took me a long time to eat here after hearing about it for years. It is so way out of the way for me. On the way home from a day trip up north I decided to stop by. Well, the restaurant was being renovated so they sent me to their newer location on 7th Street and Union Hills instead. ( even more out of my way) The service was amazing. Renee and staff were wonderful. However, with that said I did not think the food was all that great or matched the hype. I wonder if Pizza by the Slice is not the way to go here. My crust was burnt and hard to eat although the toppings were good. I did not like the Garlic Cheese bread very much and the sauce was bland. The Cannoli did not taste like Cannoli. Apparently, they make it different here. All in all I would not go back since it is very far away for me. My guess is their pasta dishes might be good since the place is so popular with a long wait every night."}
{"text":"The pizza is solid.  Definitely go for that.  The rest of their dishes are acceptable.  Better than fast food quality, but its either way compared to sit down restaurants.  The girls at the desk were always nice and the food came fast.  The prices are very fair and if I'm in the area and looking for Italian, I would definitely check it out."}
{"text":"First time visit and we will be back again!  Great food - one lasagna and one sausage and peppers over pasta. Food was delicious and the staff and owner were very pleasant.  I was a bit concerned when we first arrived, as there we only a couple of occupied tables, but when we left it was much busier.  Considering it was a Tuesday evening, two days before Thanksgiving - not too bad.  This will be our new go-to for Italian food."}
