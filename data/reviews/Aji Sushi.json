{"text":"This was my very first time ordering from this restaurant.  I ordered a salmom teriyaki combo bento box and 3 maki rolls lunch special. The salmon teriyaki was absolutely delicious and I would reccomend, however,  it did not come with teriyaki sauce. Very dissapointing because it's what completes the meal.  The maki rolls I ordered all came together, but some of the rolls were saturated with soy sauce. There wasn't even soy sauce in the actual container so they must've made a mistake in the kitchen or something. Because of that, they came saugy and look gross. Not impressed at all by that.  Theres no fortune cookies like other places but they did provide me with a.complimentary sesame ball and spring roll. Not to sure if I will order again from this place, or atleast not for the maki rolls."}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm so happy it's walking distance from my apartment.  Great food, great price and friendly service. I go here a few times a month. Perfect for a date, casual lunch or a nice family dinner."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic sushi, fried rice and the best miso/wonton soups Ive tried anywhere. Very friendly service and highly affordable for quality food! Don't hesitate!"}
{"text":"Les spécialités sont excellent à essayer absolument, un restaurant de sushi incontournable dans la région de Terrebonne.  Je le recommande vivement."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for AYCE lunch at 3:45pm to learn that their lunch times end at 3:15pm, which I found pretty early (I don't know much about other restaurant lunch times). We settled for AYCE dinner ($24 each person, ended up being $57 in total excluding tip). Without the (small selection) buffet, I would say that this place may be overpriced for the service and quality of food.   Getting the attention of our servers was difficult to begin with, let alone the wait times for the sushi to be served (we're spoiled by Kyoto's at Dundas and Bay). Some of the buffet trays were not filled timely.   There is a great selection of sushi, sashimi, and main dishes on the menu. We were surprised that the sushi was larger than usual because they used more rice, so don't order too many to begin with. But that also meant the sashimi was larger too. However, my guy from his experience working in the seafood department recognized the low quality of the sashimi and so it was interesting to eat them.   As for the environment, the decor is fine. Considering we just missed the lunch time, I wondered if it was much busier compared to the family party and maybe 3 other couples. The place is large enough to easily fit 2 more family-style parties.   All in all, now my boyfriend remembers why he didn't come back after a long while i.e. would not recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I go there almost every week. They must get tired of seeing us haha. But this place is BOMB. THEY ARE SO FRESH. And there's a wide selection of sushi on the dinner menu. It's more expensive then lunch but so worth it."}
{"text":"I go here all the time, and they are normally good. But for some reason I had horrible service today, and the girl lied to me on the phone wtf. I get delivery all the time and I know u can change some of the pieces, like if i hate California roll I can change it to salmon roll for a small fee.  Today the girl on the phone said they don't do that and refused to help. Also I normally just give them the item number, but today they told me they don't have order numbers and I have to tell them and describe what it is.  I wasted 5 minutes only to get hung up on wtf. This place has gone down hill. Luckily there's a new place down the street who are way nicer.  I've been going there for over 10 years, and they just lost my business. *throwing menu in trash*"}
{"text":"Les meilleurs sushis tout simplement. Le restaurant offre des spécialités originales et se démarque par sa qualité. Je dois cependant avouer que la facture peut monter rapidement. Repas à deux a essayer."}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times total and the food quality is unpredictable. The first two times were great but It gradually became gross. In my opinion, it's better to go at lunch since it's cheap, but don't expect much as they are inconsistent with their quality."}
{"text":"They've moved locations and the new place is mediocre at best. They only had one waitress and she was busy playing with a little girl her friend had brought in rather than serving us. They no longer have all you can eat lunch and now it's all day dinner. We had to ask for the all you can eat menu multiple times for her to bring it over. The old location was much better"}
{"text":"There were flies EVERYWHERE. The food at the walk up buffet was stale and dry from sitting out all day. The white tuna and surf clam were discoloured and were no where near \"fresh\". I'm not sure why this place is still running, they probably paid the health inspector. The food is old and the atmosphere is disgusting."}
{"text":"A most friendly staff and a wide variety of food for sit down or to go that is always served fresh and very tasty. Nothing fancy, but fantastic service and great good. A place where they remember you as a customer. Nice feeling in these modern days of big corporate restaurants."}
{"text":"One of the worst sushi restaurants I've ever been to. Service was below par and rude. The staff short-changes me and did not admit their mistake. The sushi doesn't hold itself together and does not taste fresh. We went for lunch so we got \"free\" fried foods (made to fill you up before you get the AYCE food). Also orders were mixed up and they kept sending us food we never ordered. I'm very disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Taste: 2/5 Quality: 1/5 Service: 3/5  Price: 4/5  I decided to try the lunch AYCE at this sushi place due to the decent reviews other Yelpers had given. Being seated was okay: they were prompt with their service and were friendly. They had not mentioned the buffet style section in the back though at first, and seeing as there was no one there, we weren't sure if they offered it for lunch. After the waitress had informed us about it, we went and even on first glance, the section was very lackluster. Everything seemed like they had been sitting there for a long time. There wasn't too much selection either which was fine considering it was lunch time, but there were really only a few pieces of each item per container. There were also flies buzzing around the salads. The desserts section was very dark, and the items there also didn't seem very fresh.  When we finally got our sushi orders, though at first glance they seemed alright, upon closer inspection, the pieces of fish did not seem fresh at all. They weren't discoloured, and the taste was alright, but they definitely weren't as fresh as they could have been. They also packed on a lot of rice. I only managed to get in one order before becoming full. The rice in the sushi was nice (albeit there was a lot and the seasoning was a bit much), the rice on the rolls was super mushy. It sort of seemed like they were trying to hide the quality of the fish with the seasoning in the rice as well.  Though the variety was plentiful (lots of hot dishes, appetizers, types of sushi/rolls, etc.), the quality was very mediocre. Despite being just $13.99 a head (which is rather cheap for lunch AYCE), it was definitely not worth it. The service was okay, but the food inexcusable. Perhaps they up their quality standards during dinner and for take-out, but for lunch, I would skip this restaurant altogether."}
{"text":"Sushi buffet for weekend lunch. I like their yam rolls, tasted pretty yum. They have buffet counters with fries and chinese set on the side too.  Just after the dishes were being served on table, there was one lady (guess she's the owner) came to us started do lecuturing, yes, I said lecturing. She told us it's not good if you don't eat up things and leave in your plate, it's better go get food after you finishing what you have ordered. She literally stood by our table and had her speach about 5 minutes. Very impressive."}
{"text":"I only do take out here for their sushi when im craving and desperate. The prices have gone up quite significantly since change of owners, name and chef. The portions have also gotten smaller. The delivery wait times are more on the 1 hour time frame which is crazy because im only a 10 minute drive. One thing they never hold back on is how much soya sauce you get. You don,t get packages of soya sauce but containers full which I prefer because packets can get quite messy. The sushi is decent but on the pricey end but it's convenient and gets the cravings satisfied in the moment. The often have deals for pick up or for orders over $35 if you pay cash. Ive received a FREE roll before and thats of my choice which is awesome. They also always give you vegetable spring rolls for free!"}
{"text":"Came here for the AYCE dinner cause I was in the area waiting for an appointment.Service was sub par and the food was barely edible. They have a hot and cold buffet table for some items. The hot table had the exact same pieces of dried up food sitting there when we got there at to when we left. Nothing was replenished. The staff there were barely courteous, there were staff members kids making noise and I'm not sure if there was an employee sitting in one part of the restaurant playing music on his food very loudly and kids running around. Let's not forget the discussion between the music playing person and one of the wait staff very loudly across the restaurant. Gotta remember not to go back to go back there"}
{"text":"This is a review for lunchtime pickup only.  There is a lot of lunch time food competition in this area, since it borders on York University and an industrial area - it can be hard to stay under $10.  My meal was piping hot and served with rice which the menu didn't mention, I was fully prepared to go low carb but am quite pleased that it didn't work out that way!  It looks like they do brisk business at lunch so order ahead of time!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest sushi I had but it tasted fresh and arrived promptly at our table. However, the rolls and hand rolls were loooaded with rice. They barely fit in my mouth, it was a struggle to eat. Probably in an effort to make you feel fuller with less food. The price of the lunch AYCE is more affordable than other sushi places that I've tried. I liked the buffet style in the back, I'd rather help myself anyway.   I'd rate the ambience of the place 2.5 stars, it's nothing special. The servers however are very friendly and deliver great service."}
{"text":"J'adore leurs sushis! C'est un apportez votre vin en plus! Gâteau au fromage au thé vert, un délice!"}
{"text":"The service here is so terribly slow that I took the time to download this app and sign up just to write this review. I ordered sashimi from the beginning (my first order) and it still has not come out (approximately 30 mins waiting time). I asked 3 times if my order was going to come out and they ended up bringing out the wrong order (the sushi version of my order). Finally after waiting 45 minutes (in a very empty restaurant) my order came out. If you like to have your time being wasted with uncaring service then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I just happened to be driving by and decided to drop in.  What a treat!  Food was delicious and prepared quickly.  Prices are low and atmosphere was nice.  Staff was courteous and attentive."}
{"text":"1 star is even too deserving of these crooks.  They charged me for leaving rice left on my plate.  The cheapest food you can buy!  I went for lunch, ended up paying for dinner. There was minimal lunch options left at the buffet stand.  So for them to even charge me a lunch price was ridiculous. The salmon was warm, and very oily. It did not go down well.  The waitress was rude, and was arguing her point that any food left behind will be charged dinner price, and that they don't need to do their due diligence and letting their customers know that all extra food left behind will be charged for.  I left rice people. 5 pieces of rice.  I left no meat, fish, noodles or greens.  Ridiculous ! Never again. This place needs to be re-evaluated. Dirty and cold atmosphere."}
{"text":"AMAZING food - incredibly well priced, especially for the quality of food that you get. Rolls were thick and tasted fantastic (ordered the dreamer roll), thai food was also incredible (ordered the green curry and the pad thai). Staff was also very nice, and threw in some free spring rolls and desert."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here. Sushi was great. I ordered philadelphia and dynamite.  Order showed up to my work in 20 minutes.  Extremely great service. Would definitely order again."}
{"text":"Chinese owner fake Japanese food. Bad service bad food quality found a curly hair looks like a pubes in the seafood stir fry. That ruined our lunch and the day but the server just said \"it happens sometimes when cooker drop their hair into it...blablabla\" won't go anymore. And won't suggest anyone to go. But if you don't care the food safety please go ahead."}
{"text":"Ordered through JustEat.  Fantastic portions for the price (about $35 total including tax and tip for two hungry students). Decent quality california and philadelphia rolls as well as salmon sashimi. The salmon bento box was terrific, the portion size of the salmon itself was better than expected. They threw in two spring rolls and a sesame seed ball (maybe it's part of the bento box combo, but it was a pleasant surprise for us!). According to JustEat the wait time was between 45-60 minutes but it came in 25 minutes which is an added plus.  Only complaint is they only give 4 pieces of salmon sashimi for about $4.99. Definitely ordering from them again (via JustEat)."}
{"text":"Tempura shrimp is gritty and Philadelphia roles appear to be made with some sort of smoked salmon. Gross. Weird rolls. Tastes old and couldn't even finish. Only thing redeeming about this place is their deep fried milk balls. Have tried too many times via JustEat and am always disappointed. Never again.  Added a star because their FOH and delivery staff is so sweet. Just not the food."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from them today on Just-Eat.ca. Order arrived in a timely manner (45 mins), and the rolls were very tightly rolled and quite big to be honest! Good quality sushi, would recommend ordering from here!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh but atmosphere was like a Chinese buffet which happens to be in the same restaurant. If you're looking for cheap easy sushi this will be a place for you."}
{"text":"Hit or Miss  Ive been here many times. And the food is very hard to predict. Its either made to perfection, or soggy, gross and disgusting.   The buffet is OK. not the best sushi made. The take out menu items are much better tasting.  In conclusion, definitely worth a check out! They have the best wonton soup, and miso soup anywhere in my opinion. Maki sets are amazing (but hit or miss)   I think Aji sushi is worth it to take chances."}
{"text":"I personally never been inside this restaurant. However I always have food delivered. They always come on time, and the gentleman is always friendly. The sushi tastes alright and the beef short ribs are really good. I once ordered a beef short ribs bento box and surprisingly it came with a lot of items compared to others I've had. What always gets me is their fried cheese wontons, delicious."}
{"text":"My go-to spot when I'm in the office late. Tonight I picked up tempura udon and spider roll. Their service is quick, the taste and portion are good and tonight I was given some green tea ice cream for dessert!"}
{"text":"Had a few take outs from here. Good food and delivered on time. If they keep this up we will have a winner in the area."}
{"text":"The quality of the sushi is GREAT and it's also the only sushi restaurant in the area.   They have a buffet style at the back if you do the all-you-can-eat. The restaurant is rarely busy so the food on the hot plates tend to look dry and unappetizing. I personally had a bad experience with the buffet, so when I do go back I only stick to ordering sushi. Maybe check it out first when you walk in.   The restaurant is pretty large and rarely busy. The service is quick and pleasant as well. Prices are a bit too much.  Take-out often takes 15 minutes and delivery often takes about 40 minutes.  This place is really my go to for sushi. Again, it is one of the only sushi restaurants in the area, but it will still meet your sushi cravings!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon,we were greeted and given a good comfortable seat,the servers were helpful in placing orders.After the first round of Appetizers,we ordered the chef's special rolls and boy were they amazing.!  The best part the sushi chef(the owner) actually delivers the rolls by himself,which to me is awesome cause it gives a personal touch and he evens comes around to ask you for your feedback. The servers were very attentive and quick to react. The prices were cheap for something in such a prime area it was only 13.99$+tax. Above all a great experience here,would definitely recommend it to anyone who's actually craving for a great AYCE sushi here. One thing for sure is that I will be visiting this restaurant very often. Aji Sushi serves the best sushi in town.!"}
{"text":"I wish I could put negative stars! This is by far the worst sushi experience ever! We literally just left and I'm sitting in my car writing this. We should have taken the empty seats as a sign but it was 430. They must be in between rushes. We sat down and woman was friendly and welcoming. Ordered our first round and waited.  During our wait we noticed a buffet style area and decided to check it out. Half the trays were empty and the ones with food were obviously there for a while. We decided to skip it and not take any chances.   First round arrives. Flavour was as typical as any other sushi restaurant. Nothin special here. Moving on to our next round we noticed the eel on our sushi was already starting to spoil. Seafood (imitation crab meat) soup and tom yum soup was so salty we couldn't touch it after the first sip. Miso soup was along side the food we weren't going near in the hot wells.   We ate what we could and asked for our bill. When our server arrives she warns us of extra charges for the spoiled eel, beef bones with fat (short ribs),hot flavoured salt water, and two re-fried dumplings! (There were two left in the buffet station and when we ordered them she instantly glanced over to the buffet line to see how many were left. She then walked straight to the buffet table, grabbed a bowl and picked the last two out and walked into the kitchen.  Anyways. Stay far far away from here!"}
{"text":"They moved Dec 2017 WITHOUT posting map on door, for those poor loyal customers ith travel hardships.   NEW location is *not TTC accessible (walked 1.5 miles in freezing wind and cold). New location smaller than my bedroom!   Quoted $3 more for buffet than website said, yet waitress was RUDE  and I couldn't stand to share such a tiny claustrophobic env't with that buck-toothed B**** so I left  without ordering."}
{"text":"Was Harassed to do all you can eat after i told the waiter for the fifth time that i just wanted to order a roll, i was treated horribly only to receive a mediocre tasting roll. Will NOT be returning and encourage people not to go"}
{"text":"Update on my recent visit on 17/03/04  Came back here for lunch with a la carte menu. I ordered the Short Ribs Bento Box since I know the short rib is quite good here from AYCE. And really I did not expect that the portion for bento box is huge. Like other places, it serves miso soup and salad, tempura (the plus here is that it also includes 2 shrimp tempuras on top on veggie tempura), california roll, gyoza, rice and ribs. The amount of short ribs is quite generous that has significantly changed my thought about the place.   I would totally recommend bento box if you come here for lunch. The portion will fill you up for the rest of your working day. I would choose this place for lunch over any other place nearby.   ----------  I give 2 stars for AYCE because of its very decent foods, including sushi and kitchen food. I came here for lunch so all they had are very basic like usual stuffs you would get for AYCE. But with that low price I couldn't really expect much more. Overall things could be improved better though. Perhaps their chef's special rolls are better so I might try that for delivery. Overall, it's reasonably priced in accordance with the quality of food."}
{"text":"I'm a loyal customer, the sushi is always fresh, decent amount(all you can eat menu). The prices are affordable and we hope to continue receiving a good service from them. One fact I don't like is that few times the manager was screaming in Chinese on one of her workers, we felt really bad for the person. We immediately called the server and explained that matter. Hopefully it will not happen again."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place. Ive been to the lunch buffet 3 times with my fam. 2 times I was told not to leave rice or else ill be charged and 1 time we were asked if we can eat everything before confirming the order. As a repeat customer its sorta offensive to have to hear that shit every time I go. However.. fish is so fresh considering its an AYCE I cant stop going."}
