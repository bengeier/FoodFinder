{"text":"Stopped here at 8:16pm and was told takeout only. So they must not wanted our family of 6 money. Should post that you only do takeout after 8pm."}
{"text":"I have mixed reviews about this place. I always saw a lot of people eating at this place which much be good to check out. I've gone twice.
The first visit, I went with a friend. I got the soup du jour which was split pea and the manicotti. The split pea soup was the most disgusting soup I ever tasted in my life. It tasted like flour, like gobs of it! I thought who would make a split pea soup that tastes like flour? Obviously someone young, clueless in the kitchen that never tastes the food first. Even more so, flour isn't even needed in split pea soup. They had no problem to take it back and not charge me for it.

The salad came before dinner. It came in a plastic to-go bowl with a to-go container for the dressing. I thought this was odd as this was a sit-down restaurant that uses dishes and silverware. This was contradictory. The salad had no creativity, really basic iceberg and few other veggies and a very generic dressing. I did not bother to finish it.

The manicotti was really good. I loved their marinara sauce. I ate the whole thing. I'm usually picky about pasta and their sauce, so it speaks volumes if I'm eating the whole thing. 

My friend ordered the BBQ Chicken sandwich w/fries. The BBQ sauce was too die for! It was a really yummy sandwich with a killer sauce. The fries were average frozen kind, nothing spectacular about them.

It seemed strange that they would have some dishes that were great, and then also have some dishes were just ranked bottom. 

Another day, I ordered a vegetarian pizza. Not bad. Not something I would crave for. It could be better."}
{"text":"I am going to give this place 3 stars. Food was good but not excellent. Food seemed to spend time in a microwave before being served to me. Since I am Italian and grew up with Italian food I can tell. Prices ok. A nice place to go if you want to stay local."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times. Most recently, I took a friend to lunch. There are not a lot of options in this town. I had the Mediterranean wrap which had good flavors. I asked for cottage cheese in place of onion rings or fries as I can't have them. I received about 2 T of cottage cheese in place of my onion rings. I found that odd given the helping of onion rings usually received. OK place to eat."}
{"text":"This place sucks. What an experience. Let me tell you the story. Came here with my parents and little brother while on vacation from LA. First thing we ordered were onion rings, there was a long peice of hair on top. Our so called 16 ounce prime rib came out like a 4 ounce cube steak. And was so tough and dry which we then brought it to attention to the waitress who then called on the manager. The manager instead of being accommodating and apologetic was rude and stood
 behind his proudful food. He defended his restaurant and only suggested to take our soda drinks off the bill.  We up and left and he decided to try and embarrass more (like we weren't all ready) by having his staff stare us down from the windows as we drove away.
Needless to say I do not recommend this place and wish I could have given it zero stars."}
{"text":"We had the Mexican pizza for lunch today and it was very good. The service was friendly and fast. They have a huge parking lot so if your traveling in an RV there is plenty of room to park. We would eat here again!"}
{"text":"Overpriced. The chicken parm tasted fishy and they refused to serve me a beer without ID. I'm a 37 year old man with a gray beard. Too many stupid rules on their menu like no subs served between 4-9 on Fridays and Saturdays because they're crazy. Not going back."}
{"text":"Basic menu fare. The waitstaff was nice and service was quick. We had a cheese and an aloha pizza; both were delicious! The waitress was even nice enough to sing happy birthday to my husband. 
Prices were very fair."}
{"text":"Came here for an anniversary dinner, ended up leaving disappointed. Ordered pasta for myself, which had no flavor, frozen veggies, and tasted nothing like it should have. Mine was taken off the bill. Boyfriend ordered beef tips and a beer, barely any steak, again frozen veggies and fries. $50 on something I could have made at home for $10. Horrible food and horrible service."}
{"text":"Basic family friendly menu.  Italian items were attractive but all I ended up having was a turkey wrap.  Its hard to review a place over just a turkey wrap.

Staff was super friendly and I would go back."}
{"text":"Extensive menu but seems overpriced for what is pretty average food. However it's one of only a handful of options, so I've been about 40 times for lunch or dinner but still haven't found a dish that makes me feel satisfied paying the price for it. Plus the whole atmosphere seems like they are trying for \"fancy\" but they are missing the mark-  it just comes off as a family place trying too hard to be something they're not. And the music is awful! Most of the waitstaff is friendly however, the place is clean, and the service is generally quick."}
{"text":"Hoping to b good
It was packed there
Good cold beer
Great wraps
Nice little place
Clean!"}
{"text":"We stopped here during a tour of the Lake Champlain Islands. Food was very good and fairly priced. The burger was very good, served juicy and rare and charred on the outside. Lasagna was better than expected. Very slightly salty
but still good. Salads were average pizza place fare. Nothing special, but fresh.

Prices were average and service was friendly and efficient. We could not find a lot of choices in the area, so we were happy we landed here."}
{"text":"While on vacation, we went here twice.  The first visit was more out of convenience because they are open later than most of the restaurants in the area.  The second trip was on our last day of vacation, we were heading home and wanted something better than fast food.  The food was good, the staff was nice.  Not great but not bad.  First night we had mozzarella sticks for app that were just ok.  Stuffed shells for dinner.  Again, just ok.  Second visit, I had a cheeseburger and fries.  Not bad.  If we were in the area, I'd go again."}
{"text":"Angelo's is our favorite go to place in Rouses Point.  My family and I have been going there every Friday night for pizza for over 5 years.  We also go there occasionally on other nights when Dad doesn't feel like making dinner.  

The waitstaff is most friendly and efficient. They take my order and get our food to us quickly and correctly.  The owners always greet us at some point in the visit. 

Their Chicken BBQ and BBQ hamburger are to die for.  I love the BBQ sauce they use.  They also have what I think is the best pizza in the area and my kids love their desserts.  

I never hesitate to take out of town guests here when they are visiting.  

A lovely place that is our hometown favorite!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Greek salad with lots of mixed greens, feta, peppers, & loved the Greek dressing. Split  a yummy calzone with my husband. Totally big enough for 2."}
