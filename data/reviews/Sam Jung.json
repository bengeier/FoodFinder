{"text":"Don't let the Yelp map fool you, this Korean run sushi joint is located in a strip mall up at the corner of Leslie & York Mills. We snagged some hectic parking out front (Samjung is next door to a convenience store), but saw a sign that there was more parking out back. 

Stumbling inside after hungrily searching for the place, we immediately noticed the quirky decor - fake fireplace, xmas tree in August, generic Asian kitsch. Being in a hurry we approached the 4 seater sushi bar only to discover that it was covered in take-out orders and prep work. Most of the other seating was inside private tatami rooms. 

While we felt awkward asking, the staff were more than happy to clear off the sushi bar for us ,so we sat down & ordered. I started with a spicy scallop hand roll that came with pleasantly surprising crunchy bits (tempura crumbs I assume). It wasn't the best spicy scallop mix ever, but the sauce flavors were very good. I also had the avocado yam (tempura) roll which was very good, if a bit haphazardly assembled. 

He had a black dragon roll (unagi wrapped, they also had green & red dragon rolls - can't remember what they used for the red) & a spicy tuna roll and seemed very pleased. 

Overall, the food that we ordered was maybe 3 stars. The 4th comes from averaging that with the 5 star service. All of the staff seemed very enthused by our presence at the sushi bar and we were comped an amazingly delicious whole grilled saba (mackerel - 5 stars) . 

I'll definitely be back the next time I am in Toronto, in addition to the sushi they have a really interesting Korean seafood menu with a few items on it that I would love to try. 

If you appreciate the sushi bar experience and are in the area, please come in and give these folks a break from the constant stream of take out orders!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Every time you walk in the sushi chef at the back of the restaurant yells 'HELLOOO' and when you leave yells 'GOODBYEEE'.  Seems like a random thing to comment on, but its every time for every customer which is a nice touch.  The sushi is great, very good sushi rice and everything is fresh.  My favorite thing here though is the terriyaki dinners.  It comes on a hot skillet with good cuts of meat and lots of beansprouts, and other veg.  Very tasty.  Pricing is fairly average.  Another thing they do every time I come here that makes me go back is freebies.  The waiter always brings complimentary noodle soup, and finishes the meal with a cold cinnamon ginger tea for digestion.  Sometimes they'll even bring over a full fish for the table to share.  I don't think anyone ever eats the fish, but its a nice touch nonetheless.  Overall I think this is the best Sushi place in York Mills because the menu offers something for everyone and everything is good quality and tasty."}
{"text":"definite a must go place if you're looking for japanese/korean food in the area. very friendly service staff....ambiance is great . more importantly, food is amazing  at least compared to the other japanese restaurant within the neighborhood. 
tempura is a must have."}
{"text":"I have always been a huge fan of Japanese cuisine, sushi basically. And to find a great place that stands out is amazing.

Samjung Sushi would have to be the best Japanese resturant I've been to here in Toronto. As you walk in, the place is already different. It's very quaint and very authentic. We were lucky enough to be seated inside one of the small houses. You can have that certain privacy you don't get to have in other restaurants. It's a little difficult to imagine so you will have to go there and see it for yourself *wink*

Aside from an inceredible ambiance, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Our server was so nice, she listened to us very well for what we want. Even the other staff were all smiling and greeting us too. That's one of the best things about Japanese restaurants. You will feel so welcomed because the staff will make you feel that way. Samjung Sushi staff were amazing.

Food. Let's talk about the food. They gave us a \"complimentary\" dish which was Grilled Mackarel and it was so good. My dad, who loves seafood and only favors to my grandmother's cooking, reall loved it. I ordered Beef Teriyaki U-dong (as written on their menu) and, well let's just say after finishing my meal, I ordered another one to go. It was really good. The sushi and sashimi were fresh and very well prepared. We ordered a sashimi boat and the way they prepared it was so inviting.

The food wasn't cheap. But it was worth it. They're a little pricey but the effort they put into making sure the customers are delighted, I think the prices of the food were just right.

It's definitely a place worth traveling to if you live far. I am already planning on when I can bring my friends there."}
{"text":"It was my friend's birthday and she raved about their sashimi salad so we decided to come here to celebrate her birthday.  

The place has interesting homey decor.  Almost all tables are compartmentalized into booths so it makes you feel like you have some privacy in your conversations.  

It's also a mix of Japanese, Korean and Chinese cuisine which is kind of interesting.  Normally, I don't like going to places that mix different Asian cuisines together because I just don't find that they can master all of them but this place was actually pretty good. 

My friend and I both ordered sashimi salad with a side of salmon maki.  My other friend ordered a mix of sushi and sashmi.  

After ordering, we were served soup, a plate of fried appetizers (potato ball, deep fried zuchini and something else) and then a platter of more apps including a potato and apple salad (covered in mayo which isn't common for an asian restaurant), jap chae (korean glass noodles), broccoli, tofu and I think a few others that I can't recall.  The apps were decent...nothing amazing but definitely a nice to have.  

The staff were super attentive to us and came around often to serve us tea, refill apps etc. 

The sashimi salad was huge.  It had a mix of salmon and tuna (I think) sashimi overtop lettuce, beets, avocado and a mix of other vegatbles and nori.  Even though this is listed on the appetizer section of the menu...it is by no means an appetizer! It is a fulll on meal itself! Also, it came with a bowl of white rice which in no way I was able to finish.  I couldn't even finish the salad actually because it was that big!   

The salmon maki was good.  The fish was fresh and there's a good ratio of salmon to rice (i.e. not too much rice).

Overall, I liked Sam Jung.  The fish was fresh, the staff were attentive, and there were decent apps that I didn't expect to get (always a nice surprise!)."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi restaurant. Their fish is always fresh and the service is always friendly and fast. Only downside is that they're one of the very few sushi restaurants in the area that don't do do delivery."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere in the restaurant!  Typically when you walk into a sushi place the sushi chefs are rarely super friend.  But as soon as we walked into the restaurant we were greeted with a big HELLOOOOO and a big smile!  The booths are very spacious and I don't feel cramped at all (unlike most neighbourhood sushi restaurants)  The food prices are fair too.  We ordered the \"loveboat\" and it came with 40 pcs of sushi, maki and sashimi.  Also served with small noodle appetizer, miso soup, salad, and tradition korean side dishes.  Chef was in such a good mood that he gave us a generously sized BBQ mackerel on the house too!  All this for $35 plus tax and tips.   My husband and I love sushi and we've been having trouble finding a place in north york that is reasonably priced, with good atmosphere and delicious food... Can't believe we stumbled on this gem only for the first time after living in the neighbourhood for 5 yrs!  Next time we will try the Dinner for 2 for $29.  It's a combination of sushi, tempura and korean dish.  Other tables have ordered it and the galbi/bulgogo (or whatever it was) smelled sooo good!  Wonderful experience!  : )"}
{"text":"I think they have changed owner or something, I was the first customer in the afternoon, and service was bad. The waitress did not refill the tea for us. Food are ok but there was absolutely zero service. Do yourself a favor, avoid this restaurant, There are many better choices surrounding the area."}
{"text":"Sam Jung restaurant is one of my favorite Korean Restaurants.  Excellent sushi, soups and bim bim bop. 

Friendly attentive service and eccentric family themed booths for ones dining pleasure.  I love the top 40 music blaring at the back. Eating my stone bowled heated bim bim bop while listening to Serena Ryder, doesn't get any better than that.  

Sushi is fresh and delicious.  Maki is tasty too. There is pride in their work and it reflects on the food served.  The owners and staff are Korean. 

Price is very reasonable and there is ample FREE parking all around and in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"really good sushiiii ^_^ that's all I have to say about that.

Will defiantely be coming back here when I visit Toronto again."}
{"text":"Not spectacular but a place I go to for a quick lunch. Fish is always fresh but is missing that wow factor when I eat it. I will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"Where to begin; Confusing Menu with way too many choices, we decided to have the all you can eat which said 22.95 but we were charged 24,95 on top of that the wakame salad for 4.50 was small. 

Sushi and Sashimi - Small and sloppy, never seen such small sushi pieces in the city.
Korean Dishes - FLAVOURLESS with little to no seasoning.
Chinease dishes - also flavourless, infact I have never had such a bad fried rice.

Our waitress barely spoke english and didn't really know the menu, the manager who came to explain was a bit under dressed like she was heading to a new years party in Phuket. 
Temperature ; Place was hot like a Bikram sushi studio very warm, obviously they haven't been outside in the last week and noticed how mild this winter has been.

Lastly when we received the bill with the above notice of one item being more than posted we noticed that they rounded off the tax only by 21cents, but why?

Wont be running back here, the chef needs to take pride in the sushi he is making, and not put out such small rolls."}
{"text":"Almost every time I come to Samjung, I get the same thing. They have an all you can eat menu that isn't really all you can eat. It's more of a set menu. It has a variety of small plates (soup and salad, sushi, sashimi, tempura, ginger chicken, terriyaki beef or salmon, terriyaki veggies, fried rice or udon, etc) for twenty something dollars. I can't remember exactly how much it is. It feeds two people with extras. The sushi isn't the best in terms of how it was rolled, but they stuff those things incredibly full of spicy salmon and stuff, so I wouldn't be surprised if they burst when they tried to cut them. I will most certainly let them off the hook for that. Side note though. They do allow you to share this menu, but the menu does only come with one soup and one salad (if I'm not mistaken), and if they bring you two of either one (usually the soup), it means you're probably not going to get the other one (usually the salad), so you might want to clarify which one you want. They didn't tell us once, and we thought they gave us an extra soup on the house. Turns out they had given us soup instead of salad without our consent.

The sushi is fresh. This place is Korean own, so they have some Korean menu items as well. I've had the bibimbap. It's decent. This restaurant was not made for large parties, but they can handle parties of about 10 comfortably, I think. Limited parking though.

And I'll second that comment about getting small dishes on the house. I believe they've given us banchan (lots of it when we brought a large party), small pieces of fish (the flesh on the bones they have after the cut off the rest), etc."}
{"text":"I've been to soooo many good sushi places... and I'm sorry to say that this was one of the worst japanese restaurants ever been to... First of all the fish/sushi was not fresh fish at all seems as though the server quickly brought it to us so I'm assuming it was prepared hours ago or maybe even day(s) old as in the sushi was sitting around for a while... Also, there was korean food on the menu too with all korean people working there but the server was very pushy in the way she acted like we asked for a couple minutes with the menu and she would push her way to get us to order when we literally had no time with the menu.. As for the cooked meat... it was super dry and disgusting... worst korean umm beef thing I've ever had... and that is literally a standard go to..."}
{"text":"A nice, quirky, sushi restaurant. They usually bring out extra \"on-the-house\" items with your order which is great . It let's me try something I wouldn't normally order. Their sushi comes with a side of cold Korean appetizers which are quite good. The parking lot is small, so sometimes parking can be tricky, but it's free and you do find a spot eventually so no complaints!"}
{"text":"My brother in law brought us to Sam Jung after my husband and I arrived on Christmas Eve aka limited food options before our annual family gift exchange gathering. The staffs were over the top friendly. We were greeted warmly from the first step through the door. My brother in law reported that he visits Sam Jung at least twice a week - every staff member knew him and his regular order - which misled me to believe that we were in for a treat. 

Since we were in a hurry we decided to  order the sashimi wasakawa and the beef dumpling rice cake soup to go. When we arrived home, I quickly learned that most of my sashimi pieces were still rock hard frozen. I quickly ate two bites and had to leave the rest to thaw. The beef dumplings were flavorless and the rice cakes were undercooked. We didn't have time to look for a second meal and forced to go to our family gathering with grumbling stomach. 

Such nice staffs, such terrible food. Perhaps we need to revisit on a non holiday and see if we just happened to go on a off night."}
{"text":"Very good Sushi. Excellent for take out.Their party treys are great. Good quality and good price and they are really on-time."}
{"text":"Fresh fish, genuinely attentive service, and a great atmosphere, all at affordable prices. What a pleasant surprise to hungrily stumble upon!

Using everything from clusters of little tea light candle holders to an upturned wicker basket with a candle inside it, the lighting and atmosphere is warm and inviting. Booths and tables of all sizes are divided with wooden dividers and Japanese curtains for maximum intimacy. 

The chirashi, ($14.95) served with an appetizing little rice wine vinegar dressed green salad and fresh tofu miso soup, was the most unique and creative I've had...well, ever. Besides the usual sashimi slices of salmon, tuna, and tai, there were also warm saucy unagi slices and mini nigiri of spicy tuna mixed with crunchy tempura bits all laid out scrumptiously on a bed of sweet and vinegary warm rice. There was even a complimentary scoop of suspiciously fluorescent, yet satisfyingly mangoey ice cream at the end of the meal. 

The service was impeccable. Lengthy conversations with a steady stream of regulars coming by to pick up take away as well as directions for me were conducted in broken, but sincere English. I was able to devour my courses hurriedly with the aid of my most helpful server, but would highly suggest that you visit Samjung Sushi for a nice intimate dinner instead."}
{"text":"Decor 4.0/5 - It feels very homely here...like you're eating out of their dining room.  It's cozy with a nice romantic ambiance.  Definitely somewhere you can escape to if you want to avoid the larger big box noise restaurants and have your own little private booth.  Nothing jazzy but nothing to complain about either.

Service 4.0/5 - The staff is very friendly here all the way down from the chef to the hostess to the servers.  Food is promptly brought to you and from the times I've been there, the staff is always checking up to make sure your tea is filled; the hostess comes by to check on you; even the sushi chef/owner comes by to say hi (obviously, when it's not too busy).  Great family run business and their passion shows.   

Food 4.5/5 - As this place appears to be owned by Koreans, you'll get your sushi food infused with Korean cultural cuisine as well.  Before your food arrives, you'll get a nice assortment of Korean appetizers - kim chi, bean sprouts, tofu.  The kim chi is a winner here, perfect balance of salt, sour, and chillies.  

However, probably the BEST REASON to come here is for their grilled mackerel.  You must ask for this if they don't bring it to you.  IT'S A MUST.  What first appears to be just another piece of grilled fish with a lemon garnish on top, the moment you dive in you'll realize this is way more than that.  The fish is perfectly seasoned with a crispy grilled exterior and the inside is heavenly tender and juicy all around.  And this is an appetizer - ON THE HOUSE!  I would definitely pay for this if it was on the menu (shhh....don't tell them or they might just start doing this) and it's probably why I come here instead of other sushi places.

The sushi/sashimi is great too.  The rice is fresh and moist with the correct flavouring combination of sugar and wine.  You get a healthy portion of fish no matter what you're ordering and the fish/rice ration is perfect for sushi.  

I LOVE THIS PLACE and will always come back, especially knowing it's to support a small family-run business.   Take your significant other here; you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Samjung Sushi has this little sign at the window, the \"World Best Sushi\" that put a smile on my face. 

Lunch Specials till 3 pm... with quite a lot of choices

A lot of privacy in most of the seating: high sectioned booths or private rooms. 

Sushi Lunch A ($11.95) 

Fish was quite fresh... the Shari rice was quite nicely prepared. The only complain is that the presentation of the rolls... looks like prepared in a rush. 

Services are nice and friendly."}
{"text":"The sushi was great. We got the spicy tuna with salmon roll which was awesome.  however the cooked items were just okay. For example the beef teriyaki with udon was mediocre despite the rave review here on it. Also the Korean soups that we got were nothing special either.  The service is great though. Also, the Korean side dishes were plentiful and tasty as well as the free mackerel and and pancake dish that we got at the beginning... those were all awesome and filling."}
{"text":"AVOID!
I really don't write reviews on the day I go to a restaurant, so this would be a first for me. But for the greater good I should write a review to inform future customers to stand clear from this restaurant. 
I have lived in Toronto for 24 years of my life and this is the worst japanese/korean restaurant I have been to in Toronto and it isn't even close. I am very sure there are worse ones out there, but I usually wouldn't go in due to the appearance of such restaurants. 
First things first, this restaurant is lucky I even gave them a chance today because I have been to this restaurant once 10 years ago, but I left because I waited in their waiting area for 20 minutes without a hint of service and it wasn't even busy. 
So to start they had a lot to prove to me tonight. As I looked at the exterior of the restaurant I saw a sign that they had the number 1 chef in the world and it made me chuckle as I walked into this restaurant. The decor is relatively standard for a japanese/korean restaurant. Relatively private seating area, although the restaurant does echo and you can hear the conversations next to you very clearly. 
So this time I was actually seated as I walked into the restaurant that would be the only good thing I would say about this restaurant in my review. I had a look at the menu with my family. They do have a very extensive menu with very many choices and you wonder how they can cook all these things so well. The answer is simple, they can't. If you cannot cook something well you shouldn't cook it. 
So I did have a long look at the menu and I must have been taking too long (5 minutes) because the waitress came and took my drink order. The moment she came back with the drinks she seemed in some kind of hurry to take my order. I told her to give me an extra minute to look at the menu and she did. The second time she came back she rushed to take my order. So my family and I quickly rushed with the order. Ordered red dragon roll, tofu soup, saba mackerel dinner, and a bulgogi.
Within 5 minutes the Red Dragon Roll came, I find that very strange due to the fact that it takes time to roll sushi. My first impression is that it was prerolled and refrigerated when something comes out that quick. The colour of the salmon was a disgusting faded orange colour as if it were sitting for awhile. I was relieved I wasn't the one who ordered this because I wouldn't eat it. 
Oh, but wait it gets worse. All the rest of the other entrees came just as fast within 10 minutes of ordering. The entree I ordered was the mackerel. On first impression I honestly wanted to send it back. I never have sent food back before so like an idiot I ate one hell of a smelly fish.  It smelt so bad I had my family taste it and they just said it was horrible. 
The one thing you think a restaurant cannot possibly screw up is Bulgogi. This one did, the beef was rubbery and dry as if it was microwaved then served on to a hot plate. Everything that was served felt like it was days old. If I wanted day old food I coulda just stayed at home and ate leftovers, but instead I made the mistake of coming here. 
Now I am here reiterating to you to not come to this restaurant. Don't get me wrong I really do love small businesses, but unless there is a major change at this restaurant. DO NOT COME HERE! Your stomach will thank me.
I conclude by saying when I left the restaurant it had a yellow conditional pass sign on the window. Honestly I have been around this area for quite a while and I wonder how this place has been open for all these years when the food is atrocious."}
