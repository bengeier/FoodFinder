{"text":"Best. French Fries.  Ever.

Also they have great onion rings, fried zucchini, hot dogs...  I don't eat burgers really, so I can't speak to those.  I am obsessed with their tuna salad, though.

I never thought I'd be ordering tuna salad sandwiches regularly from anywhere.  Tuna salad has a tendency to be that unpleasant gray or pinkish color, and have a tinge of fishiness to it, if its not fresh enough.  That is never the case at Chicago Hamburger Co.  This might sound strange, but their tuna salad is the most pleasant pale green color I have ever seen.  It's because they put relish in it.  Lots of delicious relish.  I am in love with their sandwiches, and although I used to devoutly order Polish sausages & fries, I can't turn my back on my new love.  Not the first thing people think of ordering when they come here, but it's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I spend a lot of time trying as many burger joints as possible and I'm hard to please. I've been eyeing this place for weeks and I'm so glad I finally tried them out. I got the sliders and fries, two people fed for twelve dollars! That's as cheap as McDonald's at this point. So tasty and completely filling. Instant loyal customer."}
{"text":"This place is A-Ok...hence the 3 stars.  Not my favorite but not something to avoid either.  The sliders were tasty when ordered with everything on it.  They were larger then I expected.  The chili dog was decent.  The chili was a bit sweeter then I would have liked.  The fries were also decent.  One of the let downs- no Chicago dog...that's right no Chicago dog on the menu of a Chicago hamburger joint with floor to ceiling Chicago memorabilia.  They had a whole list of other hot dogs so it was bit of a let down.  The place felt a little dusty but I think they meant for it to feel like an old diner.  The customer service was excellent and I think I would be open to trying a few other items on the menu.  I would return just not too often."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. It's easy to miss and easy to ignore but once you venture in you'll be hooked for life. Parking is scarce during busy times and seating is limited inside, but it's well worth the wait. I regret I never had a chance to make one last visit before I moved out of Arizona.

Love the fries, love the mystery cheese goo they put on their hot dogs, and of course, love the sliders. Better than White Castle and definitely better than that rip off place we have here in Orlando called Krystal."}
{"text":"I lived in the valley from 1999 to 2004 and now get back to Phoenix every few years, wife had not been back n 10 years. First stop of the plane is to head here and order a 'Beef' and Chicago Dog. Hands Down the best outside of Chicago. Have seen some people complain about the prices but hey, its a small business and it costs money to get the original supplies and such. The Dogs were overflowing and the beef was great too. Nt the worlds most impressive, physically but the best does not have to change much. Good job Bob, see you next year :)"}
{"text":"Bob, thanks so much for your support of Gregory's galactosemia fund raiser. Thanks to you and all of the generous donors in the Arcadia area, we raised $3,500 toward the fight of this metabolic disorder. You not only have a great place for fantastic eats but you have a wonderful heart. Thanks again, Greg."}
{"text":"Writing this based on a visit last year, but just drove by and remembered the name again. Actually did a large pick up order to cater a Friday work lunch.

The sliders are great! I easily ate 9 of them! Definitely stop in for a burger fix"}
{"text":"Used to make this a weekly stop, but the hot dog buns have changed, thus changing the whole taste of the dog. This being one of the true chicago style places in town, I found that to be disappointing. 

On a positive note, the Italian beef is very good. I enjoy the unique style of hot peppers that they put on their sandwich. I also love the cheddar burgers here. Made just like they do in Chicago, using the thick spread style cheddar. Nothing could be better then a cheddar burger with grilled onions.

Greatest thing about Chicago Hamburger is that it is always good food in your typical small place."}
{"text":"Fantastic  Sliders!!  Give this girl some sliders and chili fries and all is right with the world. This is quick food done right!"}
{"text":"Love Bobby and his energy to keep a great place humming every time go. Excellent food and service. Fun simple vibe."}
{"text":"Great Italian Beef Sandwich!! I have been looking for this kind of sandwich for some time. Little did I know it was right down the street from us. I am not a big fan of sliders, However my wife says there great here. She has been to Chicago many times and said this is the real thing. I will be going back many more times.  What a great find."}
{"text":"An awesome atmosphere with food just as good. Highly recommend the cheesy fries. Owner is very interactive with customers. Very good place to eat."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of every neighborhood wiener joint and Chicagie Dinerette I have ever been to in Chicago.  The Chicago street signs, team schwag, and general Chicago schwag, the old school arcade games, simple booths - this could be anyone's Uncle Stanley's joint in Chicago! 

The food is as expected - real Vienna Hotdogs, on the right buns, with seasoning, and the loud green relish.  Deep fried, tasty veggies like mushrooms and zucchini, and damn good, old school sliders that would slap the towers off of white castle.  It is quite the place for anyone missing the divey wiener huts of Chicago or trying to recapture some childhood memories for those aged 25-45. 

The ambiance just makes the food so much better."}
{"text":"Another great experience at Chicago. I love coming here for the delicious (and affordable) sliders. You can order them how you like, I prefer with cheese and onions, and they always come out hot, fresh, and delicious. I'm also not sure what they do to their fries, but I really enjoy their flavor. They are a must have addition to my sliders. Whether I decide to eat there or take it home, it's always a satisfying meal. 
The staff is not overly chatty, but they are polite and provide excellent service. 
It's a great addition to the Arcadia neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I have heard about this place for couple years before I actually get to try it out. Their guacamole burger is my favorite, and the Peanut Butter Malt was just amazing!! First time I tried, I ended up getting another one to go. They also have corn beef sandwich on Thursday, which I haven't get the chance to try yet. Only thing I dislike is that they close at 8 pm which is a bit too early for me."}
{"text":"Delicious sliders for a great price. Also, it's just a few blocks from work. Also, eating there makes me feel manly. Enough said."}
{"text":"Great burger and onion rings!  The sliders and hotdogs are pretty good, but the 1/3lb cheeseburger with grilled onions was exceptional."}
{"text":"I have been looking for genuine sliders since I moved from the East Coast to Phoenix. This place is THE PLACE! At the point that I found this little joint, I would have settled just for a Whitecastle or better yet, a Krystal's. However, Phoenix doesn't have either of those. 

My mouth is watering even thinking of it. Not only are they the best sliders in town, but I'm fairly certain they're some of the best I think I have ever had. Always cooked fresh, you can tell they haven't been frozen and then pre-cooked for the day. They're made right then and there as you order. 

 The owner of this business is as good of a local business owner as one could hope to meet and absolutely embodies everything about this place. It's cozy, non-pretentious, and downright homie. He is always genuine and kid when I come in here. Though there are more \"gourmet\" type places for burgers in the valley, and those places are definitely good, this place is, hands down, my FAVORITE int he valley. 

Think I'll head over right now!!"}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to try this place and now I keep craving their sliders (with cheese please) and those soft squishy buns. I can't say I loved the fries though. They were average, but the sliders made up for them. 

The Chicago Hamburger Company will make you forget that you're in the land of strip malls and chain restaurants. It's feels like a real neighborhood joint. Next up, I must try the Frito pie."}
{"text":"When I need a Chicago fix for a slider or a dog this is my go to. Check it out and let me know if you don't agree."}
{"text":"I was excited about this place after reading all of the great reviews, but this place didn't live up to the expectations.  I ordered a Cheddar Burger and a Vienna Hot Dog.  The burger was awful; it had no flavor whatsoever.  In-N-Out blows this place out of the water, which is kind of pathetic because that's just fast food.  The hot dog was better than the burger, but it was just average.  I'm not sure that this place is worth returning to."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday and really liked it. It reminds me of the mom and pop shops I used to go to on the East Coast (except with burgers instead of slices. The guy at the counter suggested 4 sliders so I got 4 cheese sliders (should've gone for 8). Those are some tasty little bastards. The only problem I could find with them is the same problem I have with In and Out burgers. The problem being that by the time you get to the last slider (or that second double-double) the bread just isn't as good as the first. Next time I will employ my secret double-double method which is.....eat one then order another, repeat step one again; but I would do this 4 at a time at this place...

Or I suppose I could just try something else the next time, which also sounds good to me"}
{"text":"Great food and reasonably priced. Had the Windy City sliders and a chili cheese dog. Comes with more fries than you could ever eat and the milkshakes are pretty dang good. Worth the drive for my family"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch 2 dogs Chicago style and cheese fry great food!!! These guys treat you great. Food was fast good loves my experience here."}
{"text":"So the bf and I are moving in together.  And the economy sucks.  Both of these facts mean our eating out budget is, well, measly.  However, that doesn't mean that we don't eat out.  Instead we've been sharing meals and seeking out places that have good prices and don't suck.  

I've lived in the neighborhood around CHC for over 10 years off and on and have never been in, until last night.  We needed a quick, yummy, cheap meal before a movie (that budget is dwindling as well) and T is from Illinois so he has a fondness for sliders.  Me, as a native Phoenician, not so much into the slider.  When I was traveling in the Midwest once, some friends took me to White Castle.  I don't know if there is anything more repulsive to me than steamed meat.  Just the phrase alone is like some sort of weird phrase that should have its own category like oxymoron, but instead of meaning opposites it means disgusting.  I digress...

So CHC is an order at the counter, plastic chairs, thin paper napkin kinda place.  And that totally works.  The abundance of Chicago sports memorabilia on the walls completely distracts you from the less than fine dining atmosphere.  There were a number of other customers in who seemed like regulars and the parking lot was packed.  We ordered six cheese sliders with just ketchup, a basket of fries and two medium root beers.  The sliders are like a buck each and come with the works including onions, pickles, ketchup, brown mustard and something else I'm probably forgetting.  I thought they were pretty good with just the ketchup, but the bf ordered another with the works and said that was the way to go.  Now, I don't know if they steam their burgers or they grill them but these were hot, flavorful and chewy.  The buns were fluffy and delicious.  The fries were crispy and salty as fries should be and I ate nearly the entire basket.  The medium soda is more like a large and I would order the small next time.  

There is one tv with sports and I would guess this would be a great place to watch a Chicago game.  Most importantly, we got out of there for about 20 bucks which is great for the wallet.  For a quick cheap meal that makes you feel less guilty than going to McDonald's, CHC is a solid choice."}
{"text":"Drove past this place a bazillion times, and never stopped in. When I finally decided to go in, I wasn't alone. This place had a packed parking lot and a line reaching the door. 
It qualifies as a \"hole-in-the-wall\" place.  Tons of Chicago memorabilia scattered all over the walls. 
I had the cheese sliders and fries. The sliders were good. Decent size, came with cheese, onions, and ketchup. 
Nothing special, but it's a good, family owned place, that obviously has fans."}
{"text":"East coaster who misses White Castle in total heaven! This place is great! Definitely worth a trip! 
I had the cheeseburger sliders, minus the mustard. SO great!!!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this place having great food, and to be honest the food is nothing special. It just your regular fast food joint. This on the pricey side as well. Food is greasy and has no flavor"}
{"text":"The food was great, the customer service was horrible! I called in an order and asked for it to be split into three. When I arrived to pay the man at the register basically scolded me telling me he wasn't going to make other people wait in line while he split my order. The person on the phone did not tell me this was a policy. I won't be back. He was rude and it was completely uncalled for. Maybe the person taking phone orders needs some training!"}
{"text":"Always on the lookout for a good veggie burger, I heard this place had one so I checked it out. And it's... okay. Good, but not great. The patty itself looks and tastes like a Morning Star Garden Veggie Patty, which I happen to like. Got a box in my freezer right now actually. But that's the thing - my favorite restaurant veggie burgers are the ones I don't eat at home on a regular basis. Bun was standard grocery store bun, toppings were fresh, but conservative in portion. Could have made it myself at home for half the price in other words. But still tasty. Might stop back by if I happen to be feeling lazy, which is a definitely possibility. Oh, also ordered onion rings, which were average in every way."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, and great atmosphere. The owner is very friendly. A Phoenix icon that has been around for many many years. Worth a visit. My husband and I had cheese sliders and french fries. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"Happened upon this little dive and had a dinner of sliders, brats, fries and a chocolate milkshake I won't soon forget. Authentic and filling, it doesn't get much better than that. Such good, old-fashioned American food. You won't be disappointed if you eat here. The decor is fabulously retro, paying homage to Chicago sports teams of years past. The service is straightforward but attentive."}
{"text":"Very good burgers, fries, and shakes. Other people have said they have good steak and cheese sandwiches. Parking situation is not very good."}
{"text":"By far the best fries in Phoenix. The bacon cheddar third with the works is the best burger in a neighborhood setting in town! This place makes you feel like you are from their neighborhood even where you are from LA. This place rocks!"}
{"text":"The Italian beef brought me back to memories of sweet home Chicago. And the shakes are ah-mazing! I loved all the Chicago memorabilia, and Bob, the owner, is warm, welcoming and funny! It is a sweet little no frills neighborhood spot that I will return to again and again."}
{"text":"I had the Windy City Slider with some fries. It was all really delicious. I would need to try some more of the menu to really solidify four stars in my mind, but since I am enthusiastic about coming back, I think that four stars is deserved. 

Atmoshphere is divy - but if you love Chicago sports memorabilia, this is a fun place. Sliders were really good, fries were solid."}
{"text":"Best sliders in town! I went here every week in HS. It gets busy though. Park around the corner. Great food and a wonderful family run business."}
{"text":"Handmade milkshakes are pretty good. Old style Chicago memorabilia, this is the \"hole in the wall\" type place you are looking for. Not the best burger I've had but pretty good. Not the fastest service"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying their sliders, but they're just ok - nothing special.

However, I will come back again and again for their banana milkshake. It's made with real vanilla ice cream and chunks of banana blended in. I'm not even a big fan of banana things, and I love this. 

It's a casual place, where you order at the counter and then can dine in or get take out. 

I hope to try more things here and find something I like more than their hamburgers."}
{"text":"I have literally been coming here for wings for the past 14 years. Yes even when I was younger. It's the only place I will go for wings.

Growing up I always loved going to Chicago's. My dad would take my sisters and I just for some wings. They still have the same baseball pinball machine which is always fun to play when waiting for your food.

As I got older, I didn't get as often until I got to high school. From there on, I always brought friends with me to Chicago's to try it out.

I've been going often enough that some of the workers there know what I'll order. I have the same order of hot wings, extra ranch w/cheese fries and a large Pepsi.

I haven't yet to expand on different food items, I've only had sliders, wings, cheese fries, shakes and hot dogs. The food is good and it's such a unique place."}
{"text":"This place is capital A Authetic. I guess you could call it the cats meow. The second you walk in from your buisy work day you feel welcomed by the aroma of burger. The owner Bob is a great guy just ask him for the catch of the day. Always blows me away just like the windy city. Gotta love this place!"}
{"text":"I am from Chicago and this place reminds me of home. Great scenery inside the venue and a great homie feel to it. If you're familiar with a spot in Chicago called \"Pops\" and you enjoy it then Chicago Hamburger Co. is your place. Very similar in taste. Overall, great burgers and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This ain't no diet joint! When you want the real deal from sliders to shakes, Bob and crew serve it fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"I love this place, try the fire dogs. The only reason I have this 4 stars and not 5 is, the dogs aren't that big.  The place is very welcoming, love the Chicago theme."}
{"text":"one of my coworkers said to go eat at chicago hamburger company so I figured I'd try it when we arrived at the restaurant the menu was poor quality you couldn't tell what was on each burger any other side items. I figured and I'll see what the food is like. so I ordered a Philly cheese steak cheese fries and a soda and the best part of the meal was the soda. Can to around $13 for a Philly cheesesteak in order a cheese fries and the soda the Philly cheese steak was bland at best and the fries didn't even taste like they had cheese on them if it weren't for the yellow stuff that looks like it was liquid over the top I wouldn't have suspected that they were cheese fries because they also had no flavor. I will never eat here again and will never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Other than Ted's Hot Dogs in Tempe, not many foods have transferred well from the East to AZ , but this one has. This hole in wall has captured the greasy but delicious tastes that elude most places down here. 
The place was packed on a Saturday at 4:30 so you know they're good. 

I got the Italian beef which was tender and piled high on a hoagy roll with peppers and onions. Yum!
And my wife got a dozen wings. Half BBQ, half medium. They were flavored as wings should be.. spicy sweet BBQ, Franks hot sauce and butter for the mediums... and were really big. No bleu cheese dressing for dipping though. Only Ranch.

Prices are cheap. 
Service is painfully slow. 
They need a bigger parking lot."}
{"text":"*********** THE VALLEY'S GREATEST  ************
             *********** 5 STARS *************

       Every purveyor of Hot dogs, Hamburgers and Italian Beef Sandwiches
       in the Valley, needs to MATCH THE CHC EXPERIENCE.

    CHC, is THE GREATEST PURVEYOR of the above sandwiches.....BAR NONE.

          For those of you who believe, you found NIRVANA ..... because you
          spent $10 to $15, for a burger elsewhere ....... You'll come to
          realize ........ THAT YOU'RE NOT THE BRIGHTEST BUN in the oven.

Put CHC, on your \"To Die List\" .....as for the other places ....a SH*T List, will do.

                                     I rarely give 4 or 5 star ratings
                       More Than One Star .....  HAS TO BE EARNED

The Food is Right On .... never a negative experience.
     The service is outstanding.
         The entire staff, has a great attitude.
               The only problem ......... their way to busy."}
{"text":"From the outside I thought no, and even inside, it is not clear what to do - for the uninitiated ORDER AT THE COUNTER, but once the akwardness disappears you will think yummy. Have tried their dogs and cheeseburgers, along with fires and onion rings - all good - messy but good - give it a try, you will keep coming back -even if you are not from Chicago !"}
{"text":"Maybe the best Chicago-style hot dog in the city.  Hot thick fries.  The banana milkshake is a winner.  Friendly counter staff and fast service.  Fun old Chicago sports and Blues decor. Parking can be difficult at lunch."}
{"text":"This place is legit !!!  Best burger I have had in 9 years in the Phoenix area. Great neighborhood spot full of Chicago pride which is evident from all the pictures and memorabilia on the walls. 

I had full intentions on showing a pic of my burger but I inhaled it. 2-3 cheddar with lettuce pickle spicy mustard and ketchup. Absolutely loved it. 

Anytime I am in the area I am coming back. Do yourself a solid and get down here."}
{"text":"This place is definitely not for the veggie burger lovers. The brand (whatever it is) that they chose tastes terrible! I plan to go back and try out other things, but I DO NOT recommend the veggie burger.

Otherwise, the onion rings were fantastico!! The perfect frying, with onions that melted rather than being chewy. 
I know it is always busy, but if you go during 2 to 3 its nice and calm."}
{"text":"This place is great. The customer service is outstanding. There might be a long line at lunch time depending on the time of year. Worth the wait though. Fries are crispy, shakes are perfect, and just about everything on the menu is what you would expect from an authentic Chicago style restaurant.

But what is really cool is seeing that the employees really go over the top to get your food and get you on your way. The owner and the people that work the counter are extremely nice to their regulars, especially those with special needs. I saw the manager go out of his way to catch the attention of a regular that was deaf; he even knew sign language to thank him for visiting and to let them know the staff thanked him, too. An elderly woman with a walker waited in line and the manager went out of his way to take her food to her car for her. That was really cool. 

The three cheese sub is fantastic. The fries are always crispy and good. The shakes are the best in town.

It is a very Chicago place to go. Kind of well worn on the inside but you feel like you're at home. Lots of Chicago sports memorabilia and historic Chicago news clippings all around. It has a working miss Pac-Man arcade game and a few TVs with sports on, too.

They are very serious about Chicago sports teams. They delivered on their promise to give everyone free sliders if the Cubs won the World Series. Phoenix is blessed to have them."}
{"text":"CHC's 1/3rd pound cheddar burger is the best burger in the state as far as I'm concerned. The cheddar dog is outstanding for the same reason, they both use a sharp cheddar cheese shmoo instead of slices or grated, and it - along with their flame broiler - makes for fantastic and unique eats.

The fries are blanched, so they come to your table perfectly crispy on the outside and perfectly pillowy soft in the middle. Fantastic shakes and malts, too. The place has been a local gem for decades, and for good reason. The ONLY downside is the amazingly small parking lot. Be prepared to park on the street and walk a bit."}
{"text":"I am in love with their food and great friendly service. Every single time I have been in to this restaurant everyone has been nothing but so helpful and nice. The owner actually helps his employees and talks with every customer. I am a true fan of their service and their food. I wish more small restaurants where like this one. Just want to say thanks for your wonderful food and friendly smiles!"}
{"text":"Living in Arizona but living in Chicago many years of my life. I would say this place is pretty close to the amazement of Chicago's food. The Sliders were amazing juicy and fresh. I even broke my vegetarian diet or it!"}
{"text":"This place sucks!! I am from Chicago just recently sentenced to the valley, but I will tell you what, the food at this place is as authentic as a three dollar bill!! I mean they were rude, unfriendly, and their food reflected there attitude..it sucked! Owners let me tell you something just because you order a sign that say's \"Chicago style\" and hang it outside doesn't mean that it is and you may be able to trick your Phoenix natives but true chicago folk should know the difference. The reality is that if you were on Clark st. Competing for business you'd last about 10 minutes before you went dark. Your food is bland and nasty. Your employees seem like extras from the movie \"coma\" and look like they could use an FMLA day, and your place is unkempt and dirty. I pray that a white castle opens nearby and steals your handful of customers, it would not be hard. Next time I will take video of the place and the food as well as the staff and their attitude and post it on you tube for those who have any doubt. Finally, try using real Vienna giardinara peppers not your own creation because your way off. By the way, I will post a link to view your county health inspection for all to see!! Have a 
windy city day buckaroo."}
{"text":"I'd heard a lot about this spot and had high expectations. Not a Chicagoan nor do I know much about sliders or dogs so forgive me if I'm off. I'm judging on what my mouth thought.
My mouth thought the sliders lacked taste, they had zero flavor, bland, nothing, zilch. They only thing good was the bun and pickle and the garlic fries...and about those...greasy when  you get to the bottom you see a huge amount of oil or butter. 
Won't be back."}
{"text":"Best burger in the entire valley. Truly a gem hidden in plane site. Staff is very friendly and it feels like you are one of the family. Service is awesome. So much more than you would expect from a hamburger restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! They're cheeseburgers are fantastic and the fries are to die for!!! Not to mention the astounding service and a arcade games to keep you busy!! I would recommend to absolutely anyone."}
{"text":"The burger and fries are nothing special....but not bad.  Be prepared for patties cooked in old grease.  The fries taste like frozen pre-packaged from sams club.

Parking is scarce."}
{"text":"Stuck with what they're known for. 
The burgers are great. Philly cheesesteak, not so much.  The shakes are the reason to come back - the peanut butter shake is handmade with crunchy peanut butter and it's delicious."}
{"text":"My dad brought me here as a kid and I continue to come til this day. I normally stick to the sliders with no onions no mustard and a side of cheese fries. On occasion I'll venture over to the fried zucchini and the hot dogs. It's all good! The inside makes me feel like I'm filming a scene in a Ferris Bueller movie."}

{"text":"This burger place is a throwback to the old-days.  It reminds me of White Castle, but this is better. Whether you get burgers or dogs, you are going to get the toppings you want, like onions or peppers grilled perfectly.  The fries are perfect and the portion is generous.  I wish the burgers were a little bigger, but they do have smaller sliders if you need more.  The reviews here favor the hot dogs, and I agree. The true strength of Chicago Hamburger Co. is actually the hot dogs."}
{"text":"Terrific sliders! Great Italian beef... way better than Lukes Italian beef.  This is a little hole in the wall that has been there forever.  It's one of those gems that all the people in the local neighborhood know about! The Italian beef was out of this world.  Juicy, meaty, and the broth was salty and rich!  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The pictures and video say more about this place than I could in a review. It's a great neighborhood burger joint, and I'm happy it's a short walk from home.

Everything I've had here is solid for a fast food joint. Once, around the holidays, I ordered their 10 slider deal, and ate them all myself. It was delicious but I hated myself a little after. Trust me when I say two or three are enough for one person. The chicago style dog is my standard here, they get everything right down to the steamed poppy seed bun, the fries that come with it are just average though. I also really enjoy the avocado burger, the grilled onions take it from good to great.

I always like the mix of people that go to this place. Feels like the burger joint in the town I grew up in. Last time there was a teenage couple on a date, three elderly gals out for a meal, a married couple with a kid who I might have been annoyed with if he didn't have the cutest little biker jacket with a skull on it, and some guys watching a game on the TVs."}
{"text":"Best sliders in Phoenix so 5 stars cause its as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Fast service. 
Great prices.
Friendly staff. 

AWESOME banana shake!"}
{"text":"Great Scott! Holy sliders batman! 

This place has it all. Sliders, dogs, fries, fried zucchini, chili, brat... 

It's just delicious. The food becomes addictive so be careful. You will get cravings. 

You order at the counter and they bring it out to you. I have been there a few times and it is always fast and friendly and hot and yummy!

They do get pretty busy but they are still always fast. I really can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"I had this a couple of months ago and the shake was delicious. The burger was good too. It's hard to find good burger places in phoenix because it's diluted w/ crappy conglomerate fast food places like McDonald's, Burger King etc. Luckily we have in and out, but being from California (the state has the most burger stands in the world), I know that the best burgers come from independent shacks like this one. It's small and on a corner so don't don't bring more than 4 people per party."}
{"text":"Great place!  Excellent hot gigs and friendly staff.  Will visit again.  Want to try the beef sandwich next."}
{"text":"The Chicago Hamburger Co. is always on my list when in AZ and I am from Chicago.  The food is simply fantastic and quite frankly better than many places I can hit at home.  Bob/owner is right in the heat of the kitchen to ensure things are done right and the customers are enjoying themselves.  Top notch!"}
{"text":"Best value and one of the coolest places in town.  Bob the owner is an awesome guy and his crew seems to stay with him year after year.  I love the Bob's Big Ass Burger, the chili cheese dog and the cheddar chicken sandwich.  I've been coming here for 20+ years and I will as long as I'm here or this place is still open."}
{"text":"There is no better place to get a slider, Dog, or...The entire menu is amazing. 
I go here with my wife and kids once a month. Best fries in town.  

A Must go to place."}
{"text":"I don't even have to say much. The hamburger is so juicy and delicious you'll want to buy another."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an alternative  to McDonald's - then this is a pretty cool place.  The quality of the food generally is between national hamburger chain and slightly upscale hamburger chain's like The Habit.

There's a lot of variety and the Chicago paraphernalia is fun.  It's inexpensive, fast, and of acceptable quality."}
{"text":"This place is tasty, and has a great friendly atmosphere.  Not fancy, but you come here for the food and great service, and if you are from Chicago, there's lots of great things to check out on the walls.  Be sure to leave room for a milkshake, as it was a great ending to the meal."}
{"text":"Best burgers, sliders and fries in town, hands down. Bob the owner is a great guy. Try the garlic fries if you want a real treat. I frequent here three times a week and it's always great food."}
{"text":"If there is a White Castle within 50 (maybe even 100) miles of where I'm visiting, I'll be there (Las Vegas, North Jersey, Akron, OH).  However, as long as there's a Chicago Hamburger Co., there'll never need to be a White Castle in Phoenix.  The sliders are comparable to White Castle's.  But here's where Chicago Hamburger Co. has the edge: more meat & less soggy.  If it's 4:25 ;-), then I recommend you get yourself down here for a dozen siders.  You will not be disappointed.  Also, Chicago Hamburger Co. is so much more than sliders, it's just that they're my favorite."}
{"text":"Cheddar burger and fire dogs - awesome.  Burger are dripping with sharp cheese sauce and toppings, perfect slight pink inside.  Dogs are loaded with goodies with the right amount of kick.  Onion rings are crispy, hot and fresh.  Plus they have Star Wars pinball, how sweet is that!"}
{"text":"I have not been here in years and am wondering why.  I thought I was back home in Chicago when I walked in. This place is the real deal!  Chicago memorabilia on the walls the help in red white and blue ( ala cubs) t-shirts... and oh yeah!  Great Vienna hotdogs with the nuclear green relish.  I also had a two cheeseburger sliders.  Very tasty as well."}

BACKGROUND
---------------------
I wanted to eat. And eat good. I had been studying all day and decided to treat myself to a good local meal, and so I decided after years of driving right past it, tonight was going to be night I finally had Thai Lanha. However, life had other plans. For I forgot it was Valentine's Day. Plus a Saturday. Of a 3-day weekend. I got to Thai Lanha, hungry and anticipatory, only to see a crowd of around 30 people hovering at the door, still waiting to be seated. 

Bah.

Dejected, I drove out of the parking lot, noticing some random pooch place called Frou-Frou Puppie (?) as I left. Who names something like that? Anyway, as I sat at the intersection of 38th and Indian School, glum and starving, I looked at what was straight ahead of me:

Chicago Hamburger Company. 

It was like a homing beacon, with me as its target.The sign seemed to suddenly brighten and emit heavenly sunbeams. French bugles played and angelic voices went \"aaaaaah!\" and....ok, not really.  But I did automatically start driving across Indian School instead of turning right or left. Screw Thai food and people looking into each other's eyes while they pine for each other and a stick of chicken satay. It was burger time.

SETTING
-------------
An uber-casual, frill-less, order at the counter burger joint. A scratched up Ms. Pac-Man greets you upon your entrance. Pinball. Chicago sports and city shwag blanket the walls. One section of wall, however, is dedicated to photos of people wearing CHC t-shirts as they tour the planet. Standing in front of Matterhorn Mountain? Yes. The Taj Mahal? Sure. Within the jungles of southeast Asia? Why not? These CHC denizens sure get around. 

Also, there are booths and plastic tables. A flat-screen showing sports. A condiment stand with pumps for ketchup and yellow mustard, plus Tabasco and Worcestershire. Condiments make me happy. I'm a simple man.

FOOD
--------
Menu includes really cheap sliders, plus regular-sized burgers. Also, fries. Chili fries. Chili cheese fries. Or just cheese fries. Your pick. Onion rings. Hot dogs. Chili dogs. Milkshakes. And Frito pie. Yes. I said Frito pie.

But don't let Frito pie freak you out, for there are also healthier options: turkey burgers, broiled chicken breast sandwiches, etc. Maybe even veggie burgers (but don't quote me on that). That said, I didn't see one person eating a healthier option in there. I guess that's as common of a sight as seeing someone eating apple slices at McDonald's.

I had: 

* One cheese slider with the works (cheese, brown mustard, onions). I've never been privy to this phenomenon known as White Castle so I don't really have a prototype to compare sliders to, but what I do know is that this slider tasted great. Well done for something so tiny. 

* A southwestern burger (w/ grilled onions, cheddar, bbq sauce, onion rings, two strips of sizzle). Did I just gross you out? I'll admit, the southwestern burger is a giant cosmos of gluttony wrapped in a bun. And that combination of ingredients would usually churn not the best of things in my stomach, but maybe that's my fault, not the poor burger's.Truth is, it was still a good burger, and it wasn't all that big or massively stacked (and thus impossible to eat with half the stuff falling out of the bun). Probably won't order it again, though. I'll just call it my Valentine's Day special.

* Basket of regular fries. Fries were crisp , tasty and not greasy. Not much else to say there. 

ANY NEGATIVES?
-------------------------
* Hours could be more friendly to late-night noshing. They close at 8. Stay open later, people! Come on. Even to 9 or 10 would be fine. I think a lot of the older establishments just simply haven't adjusted to the fact that Phoenix isn't a little sleepy town any more. 

SO, YOU'D RECOMMEND IT?
-----------------------------------------
* Sure thing. CBC is a good, super-casual, frill-less but wallet-friendly burger joint. There is no hip Delux-like atmosphere here. Or even a pseudo-50's Johnny Rockets vibe. Just a joint that pays homage to Chicago and makes no-fuss food. 

ANYTHING ELSE?
------------------------
* I know. My date for Valentine's Day was a slider, a burger, and fries (not to mention I forgot it was Valentine's Day). And I know. If you're a girl, you just went \"lame\" in your head followed by other fond terms of affection. But that's ok. For there was a little love in your eyeroll. I felt it.

{"text":"This is my favorite neighborhood spot. The staff is friendly the food is fantastic! Garlic fries are the best. Dogs are authentic Chicago!"}
{"text":"I've been here dozens and DOZENS of times over the last 25 years.  5 stars without a doubt.

Standouts are the Italian beef with \"lots o hot\".  Their cheese fries are absolute perfection...  here's why.  Put fries in a basket, smother them with cheese sauce, put another hand full of fries in basket, SMOTHER AGAIN WITH CHEESE SAUCE.

When you are done with these cheese fries you are looking for more fries for the cheese, not more cheese for the fries.

Then, when you walk out, school girls and boys break into song and birds start chirping.

Oh, I have to mention the cheese steak.  I don't like the standard way they do it (beef, onions, cheese) BUT if you ask for it \"Philly Style\" they do it with their cheese sauce that they add extra cheddar cheese to.

Yum yum yum."}
{"text":"One reviewer said it was a love it or hate it kind of place.  Truth is,  I don't know ANYONE who doesn't at least like it...and most of us love it!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this restaurant for years so today I stopped in. I LOVE all the Chicago memorabilia which was enhanced by the DELICIOUS sliders I tried. They were smothered in fried onions, pickles, a perfect blend of ketchup and brown mustard on a wonderfully fresh bun. I will definitely be back to try the Vienna hot dogs and shakes."}
{"text":"Believe the hype. This is where you need to get your burgers. My husband and I are avid In-N-Out fans, but not anymore. Not after eating here. It's not fancy, but you can screw that when you've got food this nom nom nom nom. There's ample seating with comfy tables, chairs, and booths. Hipsters, run along.

A few months ago I was in Chicago when it turned out that the hotel mgr was from Scottsdale. He wrote down the name of this place on a piece of paper; and when I got home I stuck it on the fridge. 

My husband said he wanted to try it tonight. Neither of us had very high expectations. We've been to places where Yelp reviews are spectacular, and the food was asi-asi. And on the flip side, we've gone to places with lackluster reviews where the food was outstanding. 

I ordered the bratwurst special, with sauerkraut,  that came with your choice of fries or coleslaw. I upgraded to the garlic fries and a coffee milkshake. My husband ordered the 1/3lb guacamole burger.

While I love good kimchi, I've never really been a fan of sauerkraut. That changed tonight. Their sauerkraut didn't overpower the brat but was a beautiful accompaniment to the savory beer flavored meat. The garlic fries were huge; you'll want to share them. I love garlic and these an ample amount of it.

Someone else mentioned that they're a grease bomb, which is true. There was quite a bit of melted butter at the bottom, but they were pretty sinful.  *Make sure you get them!* The hamburger meat melted in my mouth. And the guacamole was not only fresh but it was probably the best guac I've had in a long time. If I could sing, I'd be singing an aria right about now.

They're closed on Sundays and they only have brats on Wednesday/Saturdays. Regardless, we'll be back. I'm excited to explore the menu."}
{"text":"This used to be a go to spot for me and my co-workers when I worked at Washington Mutual. It has been years since I've indulged in one of their greasy burgers so decided to check it out last week. It was a big disappointment, and as a midwest girl I wish that never happened. The shake was delish, but the cheeseburger my husband had was the smallest I've ever seen. It did not come anywhere close to the edges of the bun and was abnormally small. We double checked the receipt to see if they misunderstood and gave him a kid's burger. But no he even opted for lots of toppings, you know like grown ups do! My hamburger was a normal size but totally pink in the middle and grossed me out. 1 out of 3 items were okay, but that is not acceptable from a local staple eatery. In the past I may have excused it as a one off experience but we went in on a weekday long after the lunch crowd. So there is no reason to offer a sub par product. Oh and please do something about the fly infestation, it was hard to sit there and look at the memorabilia let alone try and eat part of my sandwich. One star for the shake and one for the trip down memory lane, no bueno."}
{"text":"Another amazing locally-owned burger shop with great burgers and milkshakes. I love getting their chocolate & PB (skippy or JIF chunky!) shake. It always hits the spot!"}
{"text":"no to bad of a hole in the wall the burger reminded me of fat burger with the relish on it the bun was average the sauce was tasty the price is cheaper than most that put it to 4 stars the banana shake is OK a best vanilla ice-cream with pieces of banana the device is grate for a counter if you are my n the area worth the drive bye"}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food. This is a must stop for any lunchtime visit. I personally think the coleslaw is outstanding."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. cheap but great food and really nice staff.  the place has a great atmosphere with old Chicago stuff.  Their hot dogs are great. I personally love the chili dog.  The sliders are great too and  the french fries are the type that are amazing when warm but are still amazing when there cold.  You can also get authentic cheese fries, which accordingly to my girlfriend (a Chicago native) is nearly impossible in Phoenix. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. We go to it at least 3 times a month."}
{"text":"This is, hands down, the best place in town to get a Chicago dog. I've been going there for nearly 10 years now. I always order the hot dog because it reminds me of being at home in Illinois. They're just perfect. 
Every Friday the owner of the company I work for springs for lunch for all 30 employees and today I had the pleasure of picking our order up from Bob, Chicago's owner. He's a real sweetie. We just had the best sliders, fries and onion rings for the office. 5 stars. Anyone looking for good food on the cheap, great service and the Cubbies or Bears on the TV..this is where you need to be."}
{"text":"A little slice of Chicago style food heaven.  Perfect place to get your slider fix.  It's a quaint restaurant, easy parking, fast service and reasonably priced.

Best part is... they don't mind when I wear my St. Louis Cardinals hat.

Get there early, they unfortunately close at 8PM"}
{"text":"Good food! Nice staff. Great service! Came here with my bff on our lunch break about an hour before they closed and they served our food hot fresh and quick! We are addicted to their cheese fries!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today....I was craving a burger when a coworker suggested this place.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  The sliders reminded my of a place that I frequented in Hackensack, NJ called White Mana...The sliders that Chicago Hamburger Co served were delicious.  I am not from the Midwest, but this Jersey girl did enjoy a little taste of Chicago today!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! Bob has it down when it comes to a taste of Chicago. Everyone here is friendly the place is clean and adorned with cool decor favoring the cubs and local sports teams and accomplishments. The food is fantastic and they make the best root beer shake I have ever had. Definitely worth the stop in!!! Love it here!!"}
{"text":"If you love a dirty spoon for burgers dogs or fries this is your place. 

Sliders and hotdogs are great and really hit the spot. 

The shakes are good and made with real mix-ins. If you love banana you must try the banana shake!

Also if you are a sports fan they have a ton of just cool Chicago centric objects all over the place."}
{"text":"Italian beefs, hotdogs, sliders, and really good cheese burgers! The beef and sausage combo is my favorite, sweet and hot peppers are a must and the fires are always constantly crispy.(usually order mine extra crispy) Longer wait but totally worth it. Good food, reasonable prices, and fast service. Good lunch grub spot. Oh did I mention Frito pie... Mmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Omfg! This place is awesome!  My bf is from Chicago, and said this place made him homesick, it's that good. Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had, fries were nice n crisp, soft in the middle.  I'm hooked, we will br back"}
{"text":"the grilled chicken sandwich hold the mayo add ketchup and mustard and the fries - off the chain!  minus one star because it should stay open later."}
{"text":"After a long day of work, both my friend and I need something for dinner, so we head to Chicago Hamburger Co.  My friend has been wanting to take me there for a long time, so I said sure, why not?

When we got there, it was just a bit before 7pm and it wasn't very crowded.  I ordered the daily special, which was the Grilled Bratwurst w/ Fries or Cole Slaw.  My friend ordered the Chili Dog with Garlic Fries.  The garlic tasted really thick and both of us weren't really a fan, but the fries was absolutely great.  It was very crispy and fresh, not of those frozen fries you get at other fast food joints.  The bratwurst is good, but could be bigger.  The chili sauce is good too.

I would definitely go back and try their other daily specials whenever I'm going to be in the neighborhood the next time.  Good food, I'll definitely be bringing my friends over next time."}
{"text":"This place is incredibly good.

Don't come here expecting the fanciest of establishments.
There are no waiters.  No valet.  Just tasty, affordable burgers, fries, sliders, and hot dogs.

If you're looking for some good food for not much $$, this is a great spot.

I only wish they were open past 8 PM to satisfy late-night cravings!  :-)"}
{"text":"Great place. The sports decor on the wall really sets a fun atmosphere. I had the firedog with the amazing neon green relish and it was awesome. Also tried the special of the day which was sloppy joes, which were the best I've ever tasted. They were completely unique and tasty. The service was precise and quick. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Yummy slider alert!  

Much better than the average White Castle barf disk, and even better than the sliders at Cheesecake Factory.  I ordered three cheese sliders for a little over $3 (I know, I know, I was HON-gry!) and although they're small it was quite filling.  Nice use of soft rolls, dijon mustard, ketchup, minced onions and flavorful beef and cheese.

The inside is tacky -- with sports posters everywhere, arcade games, real Chicago street signs (think Kedzie, Cermak, Paulina, and Southport), and old newspaper clippings and tons of Best of Phoenix awards scattered throughout.  Vinyl booths line the front of the building with plastic patio tables as well. 

I heard good things about their hot wings and hot dogs, so will def be back to try.

Super cheap, super Chicago divey-chic, and super good."}
{"text":"It was, ok. I'm not sure why they bothered putting a spoon in the milkshake, it was far too runny to use a spoon for. Besides being too runny, the milkshake tasted great and you could tell they used real peanut butter in it. The fries were thick cut and not very greasy but lacked any real seasoning and that is with the additional cajun seasoning I added. The polish had a great bun and the dog itself was pretty decent. The relish looked so radioactively green that I'm not entirely sure what it was made of. The two small bits of tomato looked great, but again lacked much flavor. Overall I would return if I was in a bind for some place to grab a semi quick bite of food as my $11 didn't leave me hungry."}
{"text":"I love authentic diners. Those little hole in the wall places that have mastered being unassuming and delicious and just concentrate on making great food quickly and aren't another trendy burger franchise trying to emulate that experience.

Chicago Hamburger Co. has that down. Their sliders are a little bigger than I thought they'd be but they're awesome and filling. Their fries are delicious and their milkshakes are just creamy deliciousness. Its tiny but the interior is homey and if you're in the area hit it for a nice meal you'll remember and savor enough to want to write a Yelp review about it,.

They even have a Rahm Emanuel for Mayor poster."}
{"text":"The sliders are fantastic.

The Chicago style hotdogs are good as well. 

If I was including the years of positive experiences I have had with my family at  this location I would add another star."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic choice by my girlfriend for our \"C\" restaurant in the ABC restaurant game.  I loved this place as it was a great burger joint.  I had the typical cheeseburger and some cheese fries.  Food was great!  The environment was cool as it had a Chicago sports theme."}
{"text":"I've been patronizing CHC going back to the 80's.  I'm a foodie to foodie's...I know food.  As such, Bob (owner from Illinois) delivers an authentic experience.  Show respect and take care of his staff and you won't be disappointed.  For what it is, 10 out of 10!"}
{"text":"I like this place! It's close by, and when you walk inside it really shows why the place is called Chicago Hamburger!

Food is good, nice and hot and also surprisingly somewhat fresh. Only flaw is the price... I think the prices are a bit over charged. Other than that NOT TOO SHABBY! 

Also, I think they should open on Sundays. Its not like they're open till late at night on weekdays."}
{"text":"This place rocks! It's as close as you're gonna get to a WC this side of the Mississippi and in my opinion its much better!

The sliders are perfectly cooked with all the fixings, taste amazing, and bring that mid-west experience of sitting at the slider joint trying to eat 2 dozen at a time. I wish I could tell you more about the other menu items, other than their fantastic homemade milkshakes, but every time I get here its a toss-up on the single or double cheese sliders.

It's a Chi-Town sports themed sit-down type place with old-school booths and a hometown feel.

The only negative I have on this place is parking, but I usually get there early to avoid the rush, you can park on the side street too.

It takes every ounce of restraint not to stop here when I drive past, do yourself a favor and stop in."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Bobs bad ass burger is a must! The ambiance makes you wanna visit Chicago! Sloppy joes are amazing too. Great spot and Bob is personal and very kind"}
{"text":"My sister lives in Arizona and every time I come for a visit, we have to stop by this place. This place has THE best sliders. Better than White Castle!!! Not only are their sliders AMAZING, everything else is also. Their fries, veggie burgers, and milkshakes are all great and their onion rings are straight up TO DIE FOR. I prefer a chocolate  shake with my savory food. 
They have outdoor seating which is nice if you want to take a pet, which I happened to bring a few visits ago. Their seating inside is pretty comfortable as well. The tables aren't crowding each other and the memorabilia all over the walls is interesting to look at."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! They have consistently served great sliders and chili and I've been coming here for probably 20 year. They are a great place and seem to treat their workers right because I've seen the same people working for over 20 years. I can't recommend the double sliders enough and banana shake!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The chili fries are AMAZING! The best peanut butter shake I've ever had. Get it and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"CHC is a valley institution. I've been a happy customer since I was a kid. Bob the owner is always happy to see you and is a great guy. 

At CHC the sliders are the stars of the show. Get several and be a happy camper. Also don't miss their shakes and fried zucchini."}
{"text":"Great place all around. Vegetarian options are available for us non carnivorous types. Thanks for that, it's very much appreciated. 

Fries and milkshakes are great too."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times when I was younger and have recently been going back and I'm glad to see it's just as good as it was!
My boyfriend gets the Bob's Big A$$ Burger and he loves it. He get full off of it which is always a good sign. 
I get the veggie burger and my gosh it is DELISH!! We also get the garlic fries and zucchini as sides. However the fried tend to be greasy, it add to the old Chicago style! I just drain them on some napkins. The people are nice, not much of a wait, interesting decor, and great food! Whether it's lunch or dinner, this place is great! Yum!"}
{"text":"A great find. Famous for their sliders and hotdogs. A few favorites of mine are the frito pie. Basically a bag of fritos opened up with chili, cheese, and onions poured on top. Their banana milk shake is devine. The fish sandwich is pretty good too. Its nothing fancy just plain old delicious fattening Chicago style food. The owner is always there and is one of the coolest guys around. The place is decked out in Chicago sports posters, pictures, banners, etc. Anytime I can support a cool local restranteur and get good food EVERYtime I am down for it."}
{"text":"Sliders.  I need say no more.  But I will :)
That is the only thing I've ever had at this restaurant.  Now, if you're a transplant from the Midwest and a fan of White Castle they are not exactly like that.  They are bigger but a good percentage of the slider goodness you're used to.  I still go to the Castle when I go back home for Christmas, really you either love 'em or you hate 'em.  I'm enamored!!"}
{"text":"Just popped at 6:30pm in to try a couple of those Windy City Sliders at $1.04 each. They made them well done for me and it only took about 5 minutes to get them and 5 more minutes to eat them. I guess I was expecting more of the White castle experience (my fav burger chain) since that chain started in the Midwest, but these were good, but just run of the mill burgers. White Castle steams everything including buns, but Windy City doesn't. The buns are regular and the burger just comes off grill with the additions of pickles and onions and ketchup (no mustard for me). Nothing wrong with these sliders at all, but don't expect anything like the castle legend. Place itself was loaded with old Chicago sports posters, but seemed like a makeover might be needed or is that the charm of the place I suppose."}
{"text":"Been going for a few years now.  Haven't tried much of the  menu yet as every time I go I simply MUST get sliders or a Firedog.  The fries are great, especially buried in cajun spice but the onion rings hold their own as well.

Also, I guess I'll throw in that the soda tastes like it's supposed to (some places manage to have awful tasting soda.  I don't know how that happens).

The place is small and can get busy during lunch but it also has a very comfy home feeling."}
{"text":"I went there on a Monday and had the special which was a Chicago style hotdog and fries. I also ordered a slider with cheese. The hotdog was a Vienna Beef hotdog trimmed with the things that make a Chicago dog, and served on a poppy seed roll. It was like being in Chicago. Everything was fresh and tasty. The fries were hot, and cook perfectly. The slider was amazing as well. The bun was steamed, the meat was tasty. I really enjoyed the food, the prices are very reasonable, the service was great. I am leaving the area soon, but plan on a few more trips before I go."}
{"text":"The hot dogs here are always scrumptious and the fries aren't too shabby either. The chocolate shake however is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. It is the best hot dog place in the Biltmore area hands down."}
{"text":"This is your quintessential Chicago dog place.  They do a great job on all their dogs/sausages.  We also tried their sliders and Italian beef which were both good also but the Chicago dogs were definitely that thing to get here.  I would recommend this place to anybody craving a Chicago dog and sliders."}
{"text":"Sliders are the reason I first started to go here; but I have grown to love the other food.  Always wanted to try White Castle; so, I've gone to ones in Cleveland, Minneapolis - I love Chicago Hamburgers more!!!  The fries are very close to perfect; but I love Chicago dogs, so I order Chicago dog (comes with fries); and sliders; I am so full; I don't need to eat for a couple of days."}
{"text":"Just do yourself a favor and go here and get the sliders, they are fantastic!!  I think the soft and chewy roll is what makes them so damn addictive!!  I have actually never tried anything else on the menu because all I know is that when I go here all I want is sliders!!  The decor of this place is really cool as well.  All stuff Chicago sports.  Although I'm not a fan of Chicago I understand this place.  If a place like this existed in Phoenix that had all things Boston I would love it!  I really don't have much more to say though about the place since I have only tried one thing but I will say this.  The staff is friendly and if the the Cubs ever win the World Series, it's free sliders!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The sliders are very similar to White Castle and the shakes are heavenly! Can't wait to come back and try the dogs and Italian beef."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was a kid! My favorite fries in town, and best got dogs! Another favorite-the grilled chicken salad. Deeeelish! Chocolate and pb shakes are great too!"}
{"text":"One of my Arcadia faves. Their sliders are great and so are the burgers, when I'm not in the mood for a burger their Chicago dogs are awesome (fully loaded w/all the fixings). Their french fries are my favorite, I always ask for them well done so they come out extra crispy. They also have fantastic malts."}
{"text":"Great burger place. Very similar to Ted's in Tempe. Closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"I love this place!

I came here for a birthday lunch with the in-laws and I was very excited. One word: Sliders. Scratch that, make it two words: cheap sliders! 

I didn't realize there was a place in the Valley you could get a super cheap, really good burger. The sliders were very filling. We ordered by the dozen, so it was also a little cheaper than buying them individually. 

So good. The fries, onion rings were also very good. 

I think this place should have a challenge. Eat 20 in 20 minutes and it's free! Or something like that. 

I liked the atmosphere. The walls are completely covered with random stuff and it adds to the charm. 

Is there something else here on the menu I should definitely try? I need some recs! 

I'd reccomend this place if you're ever in the area."}
{"text":"Finally tried this tonight after driving by 1000x. Fantastic burger and cute little spot for Chicagoans."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic Chicago food joint, this is your place! Don't expect anything fancy or healthy but expect your tastebuds to dance once you take a bite! My boyfriend and I stopped in here on Monday to grab some sliders for an afternoon snack (I know, SO bad but we couldn't resist! In my defense, I only had 1!). Oh my goodness, they knock my socks off every time! Each slider has grilled onions, pickles and cheese. I recommend getting a side of pepperoncinis as well! You can buy their sliders by the dozen for under $15 if you need to grab a quick dish to bring to a party! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm waiting for my dogs now.... This place does it right. Feel like I am back home on the North side... Vienna hot dogs, steamed buns, and a banana shake that rivals any I've ever had.... food's here... Review done, time to eat."}
{"text":"This place puts Chicago here in Phoenix.  Best sliders, burger and more with quick service.  So don't be scared of all the cars or lines during the lunch rush they move relatively quick and worth it!!"}
{"text":"After 4pm $9 for 10 regular sliders, and $10 for sliders with chz. 
Pretty decent place with good food. I had 3 sliders with the all the basic toppings (onions/pickles) and fries, they were all yummy. I will go back to try the other items."}
{"text":"Words cannot describe how amazing this place is, although I will try.

This is one of my favorite restaurants. I'm originally from Chicago and this is the only restaurant I've found in Phoenix with REAL Chicago style food. My favorite dish are the cheese fries. This is the only place in Phoenix I've been able to find Chicago-style cheese sauce, not that fake Velveeta stuff. My fiance swears by their chili dogs and sliders, saying they are amazing.

To make matters even better, they are ridiculously cheap. My fiance and I will go and barely go over $10 for the both of us. I definitely recommend going. If you are a native Chicagoan, its mandatory."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing! Love everything about this place. Food, people, environment! Frequent often."}
{"text":"This is the best place to go for sliders! I haven't had anything I didn't like there. Older building but full of character, been going since I moved here seven years ago."}
{"text":"Always a spot to grab a bite. Staff is friendly, food is always good. Today's pick for us was 4 double sliders , cheese fries med soda and a water $17 very affordable."}
{"text":"Was craving a Chicago style dog. And came across this place . I hear that they have pretty good hot dogs, but are really known for their sliders.  the staff was friendly and and very efficient. I ordered a chili cheese dog and a double beef cheese slider and fries. Started with the slider, must confess I should have gotten more than one instead of the hot dog . Even though I was craving the hot dog these sliders are really tasty. I'll know next time. As for the chili dog it was good but not as good as the sliders. I Will definitely be back again for sliders. I will also try the Italian beef and Philly cheese steaks."}
{"text":"When a place has as many reviews as Chicago Hamburger Co and it rates 4 stars, sometimes I wonder why bother with a review.  Well, 1) it's good to have several current reviews and 2) i try and provide a little different view.  I bring my 5 1/2 yr old daughter here about twice a month.  She likes to call it \"Chicag - eee's\" (Like weenies).  This is one of those places where a little dirt is not only acceptable but seems to add to the flavor.  I'm not talking about health code issues, just the dirt that comes from a well-worn well-known place.  The staff and cooks toil hard yet are always quick and friendly.  The food is great.  It's not backyard bbq good - - - it's hole-in-the-wall kinda good.  The shakes are great.  The prices are even better.  My daughter always wins a stuffed animal from the \"Claw Arcade Game\" - - - although it's probably cause I give her 20 quarters.  She and I both love the sliders.  They have a good flatscreen that always has a game on.  The only thing that would make me want to stay longer or go more frequently would be to put Galaga instead of Pac-Man.  Also, I love the red wiener dog hanging from the ceiling but it needs a little repair.  Regardless, friendly staff, good eats, and cheap food ... this place is worth a stop."}
{"text":"Perfect place to come to for burgers and dogs! Especially if you're from Chicago and miss White Castle ;) they definitely makeup for it with their excellent sliders"}
{"text":"Chicago dog was awesome! Everything else not so good. Chili cheese fries sucked, slider sucked. Restaurant was dirty. I probably won't be back again."}
{"text":"I have heard great things about this place and I had purchased one of those online deals to try it out.  I was not disappointed.  The only reason, I didn't give it 5 stars was because I was freezing.  But I had a small chocolate milkshake and the special of the day, philly cheesesteak.  My husband had a cheeseburger slider, chili cheese dog, and french fries.  We really liked the food.  If you want the sliders, make sure you order at least 3, I would say, because they're kind of small.

My husband is from Illinois, so walking into Chicago Hamburger Co, was amazing.  There is so much chicago decor, it's ridiculous, but since I've only been to chicago once, I liked reading all the signs and seeing pictures of former Bears players.  

We will most defiinitely return."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Chocolate milkshake and cheesefries are.my fav BUT the best part is the staff. Super accommodating for kids...always friendly. They have an arcade game and sports on TV but it isn't loud or crazy. We love it!"}
{"text":"Sliders are on point and the bratwurst taste like back home in Germany! I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place! Awesome sliders/burgers! Most of all they really have authentic Vienna beef! A great place to have lunch."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best junk food in the valley. No, you aren't going to be eating a salad here (although I did see one on the menu, a Grilled Chicken Salad). Chances are you came here for a sloppy, home made burger, a big chili dog or even a Philly Cheesesteak. Everything is made fresh and delicious. The peanut butter shake is awesome. The owner and his staff are friendly and service is as good as it could get in a place that often has a big line before you order. Sometimes, you have to scrap around for a place to sit down, but it's worth the hassle. I think it's a five-star meal experience, and the only reason I knocked it down to four stars is that the parking lot is a pain in the ass. It's so tight and there are so few spaces -- really dangerous if you've got a nice ride."}
{"text":"Always friendly!  Always yummy!  Sliders are a lot bigger than your typical sliders, so keep that in mind when placing your order. Fries was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and normally always hot and fresh. Hot dogs are the classic Vienna hot dog of Chicago. Which means they are delicious!!
The place is wallpapered in Chicago paraphernalia, which is great for a Chicagoan like me!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy a good ol' burger dive, this is the spot! Service is friendly. Ambiance is very casual with sports decor. 

They have both regular burgers, sliders and dogs. The patties are preformed but they cook them so that they're soft vs a hockey puck. The sliders are kinda like a castle burger. The full burgers have a good seared flavor. Buns are soft and squishy. Ingredients were fresh. Fries were basic but good. 

Burgers themselves were 3/5. Add in the the old school ambiance and friendly service and its bumped up to 4/5"}
{"text":"Best sliders I've ever had! If you go here get 3 sliders, chili cheese fries, and a shake. If you live in the area this place is a must go to."}
{"text":"Don't go for the sliders! Drove 25 miles to try the sliders and was terribly disappointed. First off, way too much bread, it was giant buns compared to the real deal. No flavor at all because of the bread, it was not moist with onion flavor like a real slider. Ok maybe the dogs and meat sandwiches are ok, I don't know. Please stop advertising that you have sliders because they are not!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few of times with friends, and like the food very, very much.

There is a reason, there are over 500 plus Chicago style (Italian Beef & or Hot Dog) places in Chicagoland and why no one can agree.  

You have Al's Beef, Super Dawg, Gold Coast, Luke's, Joey's, Portillo's, U Dawg U, Little Louie's, Michael's Red Hot, and so on, and so forth.  

Just for fun, type-in: \"Italian Beef\" into Yelp's Chicago search engine and see all the choices.  I was surprised that the computer didn't crash, and that was just for \"Italian Beef\", try \"Hot Dog\" afterwards, too.

So, is it truly a wonder why several Chicago-ites cannot agree on what a good Chicago place is here in the Valley of the Sun?  

What Chicago Hamburger does best, can be found in their name.  Hamburgers!  More specifically, Sliders!

If you have ever been to a White Castle, then you know what a Slider is.  Sorry for ending in a preposition. 

Imagine what a good All Beef Slider would taste like if you used quality meats and put more then 1 oz of meat on a bun.  Now you know all you need to know about Chicago Hamburger Company!   And, the price for this Windy City Slider?  $0.99!

Oh, one additional item -- you need to get here early or late, because the kids start arriving from school around 11:30, and CHC has a ridiculously tiny parking lot.  You've been warned!

So run, don't walk to Chicago Hamburger Company for their Windy City Slider, or to Al's Beef for a great Italian Beef or Luke's for a great Hot Dog.  I call that a division of labor.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yes! Yesterday I decided to eat whatever I wanted and what do I go do?? Of course I go to a place with Chicago in its name! Being one of those many people in Phoenix from the Chi, I can definitely say that this place has the right stuff! If it were a little more compact and there wasn't a mountain to look at outside, I would almost think that I was back home! But enough about that. Let's get to the food!

I had a slider, a 1/3 lb cheddar and some fries. All this was under $10 so the prices get a thumbs up! Flavor-wise, the food kicked my mouth's ass... The slider had me saying, \"White Castle, what??\" The fries were crispy on the outside and soft/hot on the inside (which is pretty much perfect). Lastly, the burger...oh the burger. Yeah, if you're craving a juicy, cheesy, greasy and all around mouthwatering burger, look no further. Every bite made me take a look at the burger and think of how good it was.

It is safe to assume that I'll be back to this place to try more of their food. Next time I'm definitely getting a Chi-town dog! =)"}
{"text":"A fun, casual diner with an authentic Chicago ambiance. Decent prices, great comfort food and straight forward service."}
{"text":"Me and a friend here went for lunch. The Decour in this place is very interesting lots of sports type things. The burgers were delicious they offer a hotdog and a assortment of other items. Great place to grab a great burger."}
{"text":"Ehhh... Kind of expensive for what you get. Burgers are soggy and the fries taste like they are cooked in old oil. Place is kind of dirty and parking is a nightmare.  Nothing special here, especially for the price. $10 lunch for a burger, fries and a drink. Also the dining room is pretty much standing room only for lunch. No thanks."}
{"text":"I am not from Chicago and Ive actually never been but Ill take this piece of Chicago any day. 

I found this hot little place across from where I get my nails done and was in major need of a hot dog done just right but once I got in there the menu got me going. I decided instead on the cheddar burger & fries while promising myself that next time I would get the hotdog...to me the cheddar burger is the BEST burger in town...needless to say in my several trips back I have never gotten the hot dog... 

I normally would sooner die than have relish or any sweet flavor near my meat but the cheddar burger wouldn't be right with out the relish and all matter of yumminess dripping from all sides. 

The fries are the perfect fries that are crunchy & yummy all at once. 

The shakes are great thick as all get out but still YUMMY...I mostly call my order in these days as they are always hella busy, a call in lets you express the line, pickup and pay. Staff is always so friendly and heck I guess by now they know my face.. You must try this place regardless of your relation to Chicago or the Cubs!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously the BEST veggie burgers in town (IMO)!  I've been craving one for about 2 weeks now, so freaking good.  Their sides are pretty sweet, too :)"}
{"text":"If you want unhealthy, greasy food this is your place!

I hadn't been here in over 7 years.  Was excited to go back after getting a coupon for 1/2 off on Deal Chicken.  

We ordered cheese sliders, veggie burger, cheese fries, iced tea and a vanilla milkshake.

The sliders have to be the best thing they offer.  The veggie burger was dry and a bit yucky.  The cheese fries are so gross they are GOOD, covered in a fake cheese.  How can you go wrong with a milkshake?  And they have fresh brewed iced tea!!  Very important in my book!"}
{"text":"Plenty of Chicago stuff on the walls, like a hundred other Chicago-style places in the city, but this did seem just a little more authentic. There was a sign on one of the doors inside - not sure the details - that said free sliders if the Cubs or Sox win the World Series. A couple old arcade games adds to the charm.

I ordered a western burger (typical stuff - bacon, BBQ, onion rings, cheese), and was reasonably happy with the results. The bun was nice and floury, the burger decently flavored, and the cheese was melted and gooey.  Not the best burger in the world, but I wasn't disappointed.

The fries were nothing special - not even worth finishing.

I keep reading good things about the sliders, so I think I may have to come back to give them a try."}
{"text":"I would not go back for the Sliders or Beef Items.   I ordered the following(TO GO) on 2 Saturday afternoons 1 week apart:

Chili - There was sugar in the Recipe.  I did not like.
Sliders - Something sweet in the Meat, Perhaps sugar.   Nothing like White Castle.  If you are seeking the White Castle experience you will be dissappointed.  
Coleslaw - Raw Onion is in abundance and takes away from the very fresh Cabbage.  If they get a handle on the Onion they have a winner.

Wings -  Basic

Hot Dog - Basic - however the Poppyseed Roll was very fresh and the French Fries(although standard frozen potatoes) were delicious and cooked perfectly, both times.

Biggest dissapoinment:   The Philly Cheese Steak.  There is something that is giving the meat items a bad taste/odor.   I really doubt the meat is old due to the Restaurant is quite busy.  Perhaps it is how they store the items as a strange undeterminable odor is getting into the Bread or Meat.  I ordered twice on busy Saturday afternoons.  Meat/Bread Items had the same Odor.   It is not a dirty odor. 

Nevertheless, I would only return for the $4.85 Hot Dog which comes with French Fries."}
{"text":"Being a part of the Arizona Big Dogs, I have had the opportunity to taste some of the finest Frankfurters in the valley. 

Chicago Hamburger Co, makes each coney, dip and slider fresh to order. The garlic fries will liven up your tastebuds and take them on a journey through time back to the good days when the Cubbies won the World Series...

Parking can be a challenge, but if you are courteous and polite, the neighborhood to the south is a secret area for your wagon during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"I LOVE THEIR SLIDERS!!!

there is not alot to say about this place.  there are only a handful of tables and you order lunch counter style however what they lack in size they make up for in Chicago memorabilia... oh yea did i mention that their sliders are stinking awesome???!!!!"}
{"text":"I first came here in 1997 (different ownership ) & have grown up eating here. I want to say, it is just as awesome. ....but it isn't.  The beef quality isn't the same. The lemonade isn't fresh made in house anymore and parking is a joke.  
:("}
{"text":"This place reminds me of back home. I'm from Michigan and people in Michigan love hot dogs. We also love Jay's chips which you can purchase here. All I needed was Faygo to wash it down with....

Anyway - hot dog was good, chili fries were o.k. - I didn't really like the cheese for some reason, and the shake was amazing. A bit out of the way for me now but I would stop by if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Being a Chicagoian and missing some good yet simple food a former colleague of mine took me here.

I got 2 cheese dogs and the garlic fries. The cheese dogs were great. As we sat and ate our food I presented the statement/question of.... how is it that some places can't cook a good hot dog? Luckily, this place has a good hot dog.

The garlic fries were ok but I had some of the chili cheese fries my friend ordered and those were better. The portions were very large and they had game 7 of the Chicago Bulls vs Brooklyn Nets game on... Perfect. I was trying to rush home to catch the game but now I was able to enjoy this good Chicago style food while watching the Bulls beat the Nets."}
{"text":"Came here for the 1st time my husband been from Chicago , this made him feel at home .thank you .."}
{"text":"I wish more people knew about this little spot of hamburger heaven. 

Took my husband for the very first time over the weekend and he couldn't get enough of the mini sliders and chili cheese french fries. 

This is a wonderful little dive restaurant that you would drive right past it and miss out on its wonderful goodness. If there was one closer to my side of town I would frequent this place every chance I got. 

The people who run the restaurant are really nice and the environment makes me miss back home in Joliet. 

You wont be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Had to give this place 5 stars, because no place in metro Phoenix that I know of has hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches (with red sauce if you want it) as close to real Chicago taste as here. So good. Great fries, too. Just a hole-in-the-wall kind of place, but worth the trip. Always pretty busy. Try it."}
{"text":"I used to be a fan of Chicago Hamburger company.  I loved their sliders until I ordered some today.  I walk in and am told they will be ready in another minute or two (I assume they just need to finish cooking). To my surprise I see the cashier walk behind towards the grill, open the microwave and throw my bag in for a minute.  She tells me this is something  they ALWAYS do with their sliders.  I have never once experienced this and needless to say I am done going here."}
{"text":"Life on a budget often dictates my taste.  When my now-former boyfriend would come home with a sack of Windy City Sliders, my excitement would be so pronounced that I'd be horrified at my own gluttony.  My inner fat guy knows what's up and what's up is two people eating four oversized sliders for around seven bucks (including drinks).  The rolls are fluffy and good, the meat is flavorful, I come here if I'm in the east Phoenix area nearly every visit.

They also have one of the loosest stuffed animal crane games I've ever played.  I enjoy emasculating my male companions by winning them a stupid plush toy, sometimes two."}
{"text":"The best Italian beef I have ever had recommend it to anyone that goes you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm a big burger connoisseur !!! This place wasn't to my liking, and I've had a Chicago burger, these do not compare. The meat lacks flavor and juiciness. Service is great but food is not good and in fact made me feel sick."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place in 2010 and have been coming back off and on since then. My favorite Chicago Hot Dog joint is on the other side of town and my allegiance will never change BUT Chicago Hamburger Co always hits the spot and the prices are reasonable, staff are easy going and the place is clean. The owner is old school and I like that. There is a sign at the counter that says no cellphones but that is for a reason. Have you ever stood in line behind someone chatting away and trying to order their food? It's annoying and slows the process down for everyone especially during the lunch rush when it's super busy and besides it's RUDE. My favorite meal is the polish sausage (Deep Fried) with ketchup, onion and cheese with a side of fries. I literally have not tried anything else on the menu but I am tempted but that polish sausage though! I read the review where someone mentioned that the owner scolded someone about using their phone at their table. I mean I wasn't there but it is highly unlikely that that incident occurred as written. The owner only cares about NO PHONES at the counter while ordering because he wants to get everybody's order out as fast as possible and besides no one believe it or not wants to be a part of your phone conversation. Anyways, check out this place if you are in the area and are hungry!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area & have been making my rounds trying all of the local restaurants around. I'm in the service industry myself, so I really appreciate great local eats. 

This was my first experience at Chicago Hamburger Co & I was extremely impressed with the customer service!! I got my food to go, & while I was waiting I noticed that the cashier (possibly the owner) knew many customers by name! He even offered to top off my pop before I left on my way, this really wowed me!

I loved the hometown feel of the establishment, it's nothing fancy, but has a nostalgic feel. I tried their burger, definitely more than I could eat, but that isn't a bad thing. I got the \"spreadable\" cheese on my burger, thinking it meant that it was grated to melt more easily on the burger but it was more like nacho cheese, which was the only think I would change about what I ordered. They do have other cheese to offer. I will definitely visit again & maybe try a chili dog next time. 

Great service!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for over ten years on and off.  It is a typical independent burger joint with a theme (in this case Chicago).  The burgers are tasty with gently fried buns, sauce, tomato, onion, etc.  The hamburger meat is cooked medium well which blends with the fixings.  Overall the hamburgers are made just right.   The fries are delicious and tasty.

The parking can be tricky.  The parking lot surrounds half of the restaurant and is difficult to navigate.  It is too easy to get locked in to a space by another car.
The atmosphere has not changed in over ten year with the kitschy Chicago theme (newspaper clippings, photos, memorabilia, etc.) and will likely not change for another ten year.

A nice treat for under $10.00."}
{"text":"The staff is always so nice and the best China Mist iced tea . I work down the street and have to fight the temptation to order the best French fries ever every day!
The salad with chicken is amazing and so much food everything is home made the dressings and the hummus."}
{"text":"Very good hotdogs. Amazing Teriyaki chicken sandwich. Very good cheddar burger.  Overall very good food and reminiscent of a good Chicago hotdog place!"}
{"text":"Being a Chicago native, I know a good hot dog as well as a fantastic slider worthy of White Castle status...and this place has both :-)

Be sure to visit on Wednesdays and Saturdays when they have brats on special. And don't miss their Frito pie served piping hot straight out of the Frito bag. 

You'll love all the Chicago memorabilia on the walls...definitely a heartwarming piece of the Windy City without their lousy weather :-)"}
{"text":"Great burgers, sliders and fries. Nice place to forget you live in Arizona and pretend you're in Chicago. Cool memorabilia to check out while you eat or wait."}
{"text":"My favorite thing to do is grab a bunch of sliders that fit perfectly into my over-sized purse to sneak 'em into the movies.  You might not make any friends if you do this b/c somehow in a dark theatre all you can smell is the onions, which I never notice when I eat them there or at home. Ha!  Oh well, it's a fun little treat.

Super yummy comfort food!"}
{"text":"Read all the other reviews,   this is a love it or hate it place and most people love it.    

I've been a customer for years and will be as long as they keep being awesome."}
{"text":"Best lunch spot in town.  Sliders, fries, chili, don't forget the kids shakes or yours!  It's the spot to stop.  This place is better than \"Krystals\" look it up best place in the south - a must go -"}
{"text":"The day after the Cubs won the World Series, my colleagues at work were in the mood for a lunch that celebrated Chicago. A few restaurants with Mid-West roots were suggested, but Chicago Hamburger Company was the nearly unanimous choice.

Orders were taken and one guy was dispatched to stand in line. I understand there's usually a wait here because they get busy. This lunch happened to coincide with their free slider promotion. The owner pledged to serve 2,016 free sliders if the Cubs won it all. Normally, that would seem a safe bet based on their performance over the last century. Incidentally, Chicago Hamburger Co. had a similar promo when the White Sox won their title 11 years ago. I can respect that.

After standing in line (see photo below) for approximately 45 minutes, the order was taken and turned around very quickly. I selected a regular slider, a double cheese slider and some garlic fries. Both burgers were grilled with onions. And the fries were seasoned and served with a generous portion of minced garlic. Now that I think about it, this may not be the best place to take a date...

Free or not, the sliders are awesome. I'm looking forward to trying some other items on the menu, such as a regular burger or a Chicago Dog. The only difference will be, I will be eating it there."}
{"text":"I haven't been out to the Chicago Hamburger Co in a couple of years before my last visit a couple of weeks ago. But I was lucky enough to score the last parking spot on the side of the building at 11:20 am. Yes, this place is busy. Parking can be a hassle.

I had the cheese burger and all the fixings plus fries and a drink for about $10. The burger and fries tasted pretty pedestrian. But really didn't blow me away, I think there are far better options in the metro Phoenix area. 

I probably ordered the wrong menu item and should have ordered some sliders based on all of the previous yelp reviews."}
{"text":"The best sliders in the valley! They make everything fresh and hot there! I got there like every week for lunch! The owner and staff are very friendly, humble and down to earth! Love this place! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Been to this place only once.  Coming from Chicago the experience at this place was ok, but I've had much better.  Would not go again since I think there are better places out here."}
{"text":"Great food! My husband got a couple sliders, a hotdog and fries and enjoyed every bite! I got a hamburger and onion rings and was very satisfied! I also really like their root beer shake. Blended perfectly! 4 stars all the way! :)"}
{"text":"Chicago Hamburger Co. proves destination dining doesn't need to be stuffy. 

Accessible food, budget-friendly prices and an onslaught of Chicago-themed decor confirm this is a great place that I would think someone native to Chicagoland would be proud to have here in PHX. 

I ordered the 1/3 lb. Broiled Chuck Burger. The meat was prepared medium-well and came with \"The Works\" (ketchup, mustard, relish, shredded iceberg, tomato and onion.) While it was slightly too vinegary for my taste (too much ketchup), what made the sandwich was the GRILLED onions. They added a sweetness you don't often taste in a burger. The bun was good enough to hold it's own...and the sandwich contents. 

Chicago Hamburger Co. has done for the Windy City what others like Ted's Hot Dogs and even Long Wongs have done for Buffalo: brought a bit of their local flavor to Phoenix. With this and the hard working staff to their credit, a taste of Chicago will be in Phoenix for quite a while!"}
{"text":"The sliders are the way to go. Nothing closer in Phx to white castle than Chicago Hamburger Co. The minced onions are perfect!

Bob's Big @$$ Burger is another favorite of mine.

Staff is friendly and the restaurant has all sorts of cool Chicago decor.

I stop in for lunch at least once every couple of weeks, if not more."}
{"text":"So far I've only had the sliders, fries and onion rings in my two visits there. I'm stoked with the place for the terrific sliders, much bigger than you'd find at a White Castle type place. They have a special of after 4 - 10 sliders for $8.50, w/ cheese adds a buck. Just about a buy nine, get one free deal. I found that four sliders is plenty for me and I could probably be fine with three if I also had fries or rings.

I really like the fact that they actually bring the food to your table vs. calling out a number and making you run up to the counter. They use real brewed iced tea vs. bag in the box, which is a big plus for me. The onion rings are good, though nothing fancy. They are cooked properly which so many places cannot do and the break apart nicely without falling apart in  your hands.

Next time I'll try the hot dogs."}
{"text":"A co-worker and I were craving a burger for lunch, so we decided to head over to \"The Chicago Hamburger Co\" to satisfy our craving. I was impressed with the inside of the restaurant which had Chicago memorabilia everywhere.

On this visit  I ordered the cheddar burger and french fries lunch special.  I didn't realize  how big the burgers at Chicago Hamburger Co were. The burger was flavourful, the bun was toasted perfectly,  and the condiments were delicious.  To be honest,  everything was cooked perfectly especially the fries, which were fresh, crispy, and serve piping hot. I also decided to try a few mild wings since I am  a sucker for wings.  I was pleased with the wings,  the meat just came right off the bone.

If you're ever in the area and in the mood for a great burger, at a reasonable price,  from a restaurant that has great customer service,  you should stop by."}
{"text":"Put your eatin' britches on.  You know it's going to be good when the parking lot is full at what appears on the outside to be a food-related illness waiting to happen.  

I tried the Windy City Slider with cheese.  Comes with chopped onion, pickles, and what I thought was standard ketchup.  Upon further taste investigation, I think it's actually a blend of ketchup and Dijon mustard.  Whatever it was, can't wait to see it again.  The buns are perfect.  I ordered two and was more than satisfied.  Also tried the fries.  A little thick for my taste, but hot, crispy, and perfectly salted.  And last, but certainly not least, a vanilla milkshake.  Oh so good, especially considering it's a hundred fifty freakin' degrees out today.

My only wee little complaint.  The place was a little less than clean, but it was still very busy at what appeared to be the tail end of the lunch rush.  Don't look at the walls or under the tables and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Stopped in by chance.. i would have to say not a bad little spot. I had the sliders which were pretty good. However i dont know what they are supposed to taste like.  Ha ha ..  the counter person wasnt very helpful (did tell him my 1st time here) i would have loved some recommendations. However love the bulls n cubs memorabilia on the walls.  I would come back but next time ill bring a how to order food from chicago guide."}
{"text":"When I miss my sweet home Chicago, I make a bolt for Chicago Hamburger Co.  Sure the hell beats dropping a G on round-trip tickets!

Sliders are a buck.  Same idea as White Castle, butt this joint is easier on the butt.  Chicagoans or anyone who has tried whiteys will know what I mean.

They're served on soft fresh buns with fresh onion and pickle.  The fries are damn good and don't taste like they were just pulled out of a freezer.

Don't leave without trying a Chicago style Italian Beef with sweet and hot peppers.  The bread so super soft and fresh and all of the peppers taste like they were made right there in this dive... in fact, I think I could see a bowl of fresh peppers from the counter.  

Service is good and the environment and decor can't be beat!  All Chicago, everywhere!  Stuff you don't normally find in AZ, these guys know Chicago."}
{"text":"Great sliders, friendly service, and best of all, awesome stuff to look at.

The wings are the best that I have ever had, lots of sauce, but they aren't drowning. The sliders are great, even reheated as leftovers.. but trust me, you wont want to stop eating them!

The service is very friendly, and the walls are plastered with Chicago memorabilia new and old. 

Its small, a hole in the wall, but its a great place for good food"}
{"text":"If your looking for the best sliders and homemade shakes in Phoenix this is the place to go, if you are from the east coast and you love those little White Castle burgers then this is where you want to go to find the next best thing, along with there chili cheese fries. This place can not be beat. And if your a Chicago fan you will love it the whole place is decorated with Chi-town memorabilia."}
{"text":"I miss white castle it's not quite as good.  but satisfying only thing is I think it's better take out.  Here is my reasoning sliders the buns need to be adequately steamed a little soft kinda sticks to the bun if when you try to put ketchup and mustard in.  When you eat there it isn't so steamy, but when you get take out they wrap it in wax paper which steams it juuust right.  The fries are always uncomfortably hot, like i eat them in the car they burn my mouth.  But I love food at uncomfortable temps so right up my alley.  

the cheese sauce is delish on the cheese fries, and yay they have dr. pepper!!!"}
{"text":"Sitting here thinking of my shitty Wendy's experience of late and wondered why I didn't go here. Also, why haven't I Yelped this place?!

The lil' bad boys are awesome! Juicy, salty and hot.. all the elements for a great burger.. plus they're so little you wont feel badly, even if you eat 6 like I did! The only thing I felt after that was satisfied!

I cant give 5 stars because of their messed up hours.. WTF is 8pm as a closing time?!"}
{"text":"Great little sliders with chopped, griddled onions, dill pickle slices, almost like old fashioned White Castle. Great root beer float. Ok chocolate shake. Good fried zucchini slices, but watch out--searing hot! Decor is very nostalgic but old ceiling tiles should be updated."}
{"text":"Great traditional Chicago hot dogs, italian beef, sliders!  The food is delicious, comfort food at its best.  The fries are great, malts and shakes, you name it, also you will not leave here hungry."}
{"text":"I came on a Thursday when they sell sloppy joes so of course I had to try them. They were a good mix of sweet and savory and were definitely very sloppy. The fries were your typical thick cut fries. The best part about this place though is the atmosphere. Chicago paraphernalia is everywhere and the guys in the back are really friendly."}
{"text":"I am new to Yelp but have been coming here for over 20 years. Always lived in the neighborhood, and this is the place to be. The 2/3 cheddar is the only way for me, but no matter what you order you will be happy. Hands down the BEST burger joint in town!!!!!

I can't stop eating here!!!! Every time I go it feels like home. Bob, the owner is one of the nicest people and treats all of his customers like family even if it is their first time there."}
{"text":"Best food I've had on my business trip. What an absolute treat. Only ate there once but wish I had gone there multiple times."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for many years, not a regular but often enough to come by once in awhile since I'm in Scottsdale. This place always has the same good quality food and very friendly service. The guys behind the are quick and courteous. Food prices are cheap and tastes delicious as always."}
{"text":"My buddy took me to this place, I had some sliders and a couple hot dogs, The sliders are very simular to white castle's and I wasn't very impressed with the dogs but it was fairly cheap and you got a lot of food. Fun little location. I did buy a shirt haha."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I've lived in Az for as long as I have without trying this place.  Finally went and I am so glad I did.  The sliders are the perfect size, you can order them in single patty or double patties with or without cheese.  The hotdogs come with fries.  For about ten dollars you can feed three people, your cardiologist will not be happy with you, but the food is so tasty.  Parking is painful, that is my biggest complaint.  The staff is super nice and will even give out free re-fills.  You can't beat that.  I'm excited to head back to try the rest of the menu including their full sized hamburgers and their chili cheese fries.  Might have to wait until next month, I did just have that massive fondue dinner...."}
{"text":"Knock you out of the ballpark food! Had their famous delicious windy city sliders with cheese ($1.40 each great price). Kinda like white castle but bigger. Banana shake was off the hook made with homemade ice cream. Left it in car with 99 degree heat and took forever to melt. So that's how you know it's og. Wifee had chicken sandwhich with guac. And the garlic fries are too die for! And their homemade chili was off the chain...highly recommended for east coast people if your homesick.

I approve."}
{"text":"just got done throwing down a loaded cheddar dog. can't complain one bit. this place is starting to grow on me and i haven't even had a normal sized cheeseburger or special burger yet. or a shake... or a polish sausage... man, i got some serious work to do."}
{"text":"I'm glad this place is still around! When I use to eat beef, I would usually get their Chicago hot dog. Their Chicago hot dog comes with fries, too. So you won't need to order extra, they are very generous. This time I tried their chicken wings, which was good. If you're looking for an affordable \"fast-food\" joint, I would recommend this place. Try it out! They can get pretty busy for lunch."}
{"text":"Took three co-workers here who had never been here before.  The first thing you'll notice is all of the rules posted on the window, over the register and on the walls.  For being a junk food place there sure rules and restrictions everywhere.  The ordering system consists of you telling the counter person what you want and they hand it to the cooks, pretty simple and all of our food came as we ordered it.

Our visit went sour when the owner was delivering the food to our table.  One of our party is hard of hearing and has to put his cell phone on speaker and press it to his ear to hear it.  The owner rudely scolded him to get the call of speaker referencing one of his many signs.  At no point did this guy ever consider that this person might have the call on speaker for a reason.  Not to mention that it was barely audible beyond our table.

It isn't a library, it's an old, dirty and run down building that sells soggy bun burgers and fries.  If you love stained ceiling tiles, dirty and rotting wheaties boxes, dirty floors and being discriminated against for being hard of hearing then by all means go here.  This is obviously someone who doesn't think before they act and he lost four customers for life because of it.

The food was pretty disgusting one member of our party noted the burger was so greasey that it soaked the bun.  Fries were fine but not enough of them for what was being charged.  I had been here before with decent results but this time was terrible and I've never seen an owner do something so thoughtless and rude trying to embarrass someone for not following one of his arbitrary rules.

Next time, post your rules on your window and require them to be read before you enter instead of trying to come down on people once you already have their money.  Bad food, bad management and too many rules - go somewhere else where they don't have ten commandments you have to abide by in order to eat their food."}
{"text":"Love Chicago Hamburger Co.  I now live in the Bay Area, and sliders from Chicago are one of the things I miss most about Phoenix."}
{"text":"The sliders absolutely sucked, everything else was delicious. I went for the sliders and left loving the burgers and everything else. Just stay away from the sliders, I think they might microwave them. And bomb shakes
Cool atmosphere and cool staff."}
{"text":"I don't know about the Chicago Dog, but the Burger appeared to be nothing but  hamburger patties yo can find anywhere.  They did not appear to be fresh, perhaps even pre-frozen. The burgers come in 1/3 amounts so I ordered a 2/3 burger and you guessed it, they put to patties together. The garlic fries were fresh but soaked in butter. The establishment itself appeared dingy and old like maybe something you might have seen along Route 66 but with Chicago wall postings from the past (way past). The tables appeared cheep and I have seen much better restrooms. The parking is a killer maybe 10-15 spots if you can manage to get in  off the busy roads.  After eating there I checked there Website and it had reviews going back to 2014.
Sorry not my type of place"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a slider.  Have a banana milkshake.  They're delicious.  The Italian beef is a great sandwich too.  Hot giardiniera is the best on top.  Service is always great here, but I recommend ordering ahead and carrying out at lunch time."}
{"text":"Great food, great ownership; have been coming here for years and never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Ah, the little things I miss about living in Arizona.  For instance, the Chicago Hamburger Co.

What a gem.  You'd drive right past this place without blinking an eye, just another dive place branding itself  \"Chicago\" or \"New York\".  NOT!

This is the best slider I've ever had.  Holy crap they are good.  Reminders of White Castle and Krystal burgers, except these are better.  In other words, it doesn't have to be 4am while trashed to make them taste great.

The fries???  PERFECTION.  That right combo of crispy on the outside, yet nice and soft on the inside, not overcooked, not undercooked.  The perfect fry.  It's beautiful.  It's art.

Where is Dorothy's slippers???  There's no place like home...there's no place like home..."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I liked it.  The place was packed at 11am.  I told the guy who was taking my order that it was my first time there, so he explained the difference between the burger and slider.  The interior was busy looking, a bit too much, and it looks like it hasn't been touched in 30 years.  One pet peeve was on their whiteboard, it said \"sloppy joe's\".  I really get turned off when bad grammar or spelling are used on a menu.  I had a big urge to erase the apostrophe on that whiteboard ;)  The staff were friendly and my burger was done within 10 minutes.  The burger was good.  I'll stop by again when I'm out that way."}
{"text":"I'm from Wisconsin.  What a better way to go hang out with a bunch of FIBs.  They know how to cook a brat (Wednesday and Saturday) and don't smother it with all the Chicago hot dog crap (a loaded brat is saurerkraut and brown mustard).

The hamburgers are also really good.  It is usually packed at lunch time as the parking lot is small."}
{"text":"Skip the full-sized burger and order sliders; my fiance was eyeing mine jealously. Added crispy-not-oily onion rings, finished with a chunky banana milkshake, and left smiling, full, but without any greasy spoon remorse."}
{"text":"Sliders, cheese firies, burgers and dogs are great!  Makes us feel like we are back in Chicago without all the snow!"}
{"text":"At around 3:45pm on a Saturday, my bf and I wanted to have a snack before dinner and he suggested this place. Never been before this but I love sliders. I love anything mini, really. haha. The Chicago paraphernilia is a bit much, but if you love Chicago, then yay. There were I think 2 or 3 people in line before us and right before it was our turn, I noticed a sign. 10 sliders for some ridiculously cheap amount after 4pm. I can't remember the exact price. I think it was like 10-20cents off their regular pricing. So thanks to the people in line, we were able to place our order at 4:01pm. Perfect. I'm poor so I like deals.

Sliders was all we got. They were DELICIOUS! I thought I'd only be wanting 2 since they're a pretty big size, but I ate three!  The bread was soft  and the ratio of meat to bun was perfect! I'm all about good ratios, not too much meat, not too much bread. The beef tasted good with the mustard and onions and pickles and ketchup? I think that's what they put in there. Whatever it is, get it. It makes it yummy!

If you're in the mood for some good sliders, check this place out. I would probably never have actually WANTED to go here since it is a lil dive with nothing around it, but Im glad I did. I'll definitely come back next time I'm in Phoenix.

PROS: Good Sliders. Great price after 4pm. Fun atmosphere.
CONS: Can't really think of anything."}
{"text":"Just do it. I got the guacamole burger with jalapeños as suggested. So friggin good. The guac was awesome and everything tasted so fresh. I called it in and it was quick and cheap. Check this place out before any drive thru burger place...even in and out"}
{"text":"All the credit goes to Graham C. for schooling my arse in this particular foodie rodeo.  You see, there is a group of 4-5 of us who have pretty much scoured the Valley for hidden gems and blatant dumps so that we can report back at their respective grandness or offensiveness.  

One day, Graham asks if I'd ever been to Chicago Hamburger Co and I had to embarrassingly admit that I hadn't.  That fucker.  So, leads the way to the counter and orders an unholy amount of sliders, which we each put down without any sorts of problems because mother of God, they were delicious.

I'm pretty sure that we would have gone back up to the order counter to request more, but the place was very busy at lunchtime on a Saturday and we also had to rush to pick up others on the way to the FBR.  

Apologies for more of an anecdote rather than a review, but you can pull three things out of this review:

1) Their sliders are perfect, particularly the Double Burger
2)  Its crazy busy on Saturdays at lunch
3)  Graham C is a cocky wanker"}
{"text":"Tasty burgers and onion rings. Clean and friendly. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"This is a great place to swing by and eat or get to go.  We have been getting the sliders (Double Meat + Cheese = Delicious) mostly.  The fried zucchini is ridiculously good.  Overall, a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Great sliders! Went here for lunch yesterday with a friend of mine and we used a Groupon. It's not the first time I've been as whenever I'm craving a slider this is where I head to. I love their cheese sliders and french fries. Yesterday I tried a new menu item - garlic fries. They were okay but I don't think I would get them again. If you are into Chicago's sports teams then you would love this place. All the walls are covered with Chicago sports team memorabilia. You do have to get here early as the place fills up quickly but they do get the orders out fast. They have great prices and it's a good value for lunch."}
{"text":"Simply the best! I have been eating here since I was a kid and still love it to this day.  The sliders are my go-to choice but the wings and full size hamburgers are delicious also.  Bob and the staff are great and everyone is treated the same, like old friends.  Even when I lived in north Phoenix I would make the 30 minute drive just to satisfy my cravings.  If I ever leave Arizona I know this will be the food spot I miss most!"}
{"text":"I am originally from the Chicagoland area and have missed having a good Chicago Style hotdog from time to time (its the only way worth eating a hotdog).  This place is the best I have found in Arizona for a real Chicago style hotdog.  The hotdog was 100% correct and well done, the fries were authentic as well.  I also had a slider and it was as good (actually better) as what you would expect from White Castle (somewhat of an acquired taste) not like a regular hamburger.  Overall a hidden gem for all of the Arizona Chicagoans out there.  Well worth a try!"}
{"text":"Awesome!! Every time I am in town I stop here. Same ownership for years. Great service and reasonably priced. I had the sliders and a Chicago dog. It was awesome as always!! Don't miss this place when your in the area."}
{"text":"Ehh! It's ok! The decor in the place is awesome! The walls are covered with anything and everything Chicago, obviously. The food wasn't that great :/ heard good reviews about the place and just wasn't \"wowed\". I ordered the sliders which the lady at the counter recommended as a favorite. She also told me to order more than one since there was just a 1 ounce hamburger patty on each. Didn't taste any better than McDonald's, to be honest. The friend I was with ordered some type of polish dog, I think, which he said was good. The fries looked good but I can't say I've ever complained about a fried potato."}
{"text":"Great experience at Chicago Hamburger Co.  Great service, great ambience and excellent food. 2/3 lb burger and Cheese fries are great!"}
{"text":"Freakin' Awesome!

I was treated to dinner here as a reward for trying to deal with a friend's Qwest DSL... 

I know, I know... You'd think that dealing with Qwest would deserve a greater payback, but I'd been wanting to try this place since the Weekly Yelp that mentioned their peanut butter milkshakes. It turned out that I couldn't have asked for more.

1st - I love the CHC for being honest. It's a straight-up, no frills, burger and hot dog stand. It totally reminded me of the roadside burger joints that my family stopped at as a kid, and 30 years later, their prices aren't even that far off. A 1/3 lb. charbroiled burger for under 4 bucks? that's a solid value!

#2 - The sliders. Everybody seems to like the doubles, but I think that the single cheese burger slider is just the right slider-ific proportion of bread, meat, and cheese. They have some options to tart them up a bit, but I just went with the onions and a bit of ketchup. I wouldn't say that they are a one-for-one with the White Castle sliders, but pretty close, and quite possibly better. Order two for just over $2...

C. - Chicago and hot dogs, a culinary dynasty. You can argue about which city has the best pizza, but those kids up near Lake Michigan have got the hot dog market covered. CHC has the all beef Vienna dogs, the poppy seed buns, and all the right fixins (scary green relish, sport peppers, tomatoes, and celery salt...) to throw down with a nearly perfect \"Chicago Dog\". Comes with Fries for $4... Eat one and smile while you think about enjoying the taste of Chicago without the January weather.

Lastly, I did make it around to one of those peanut butter milkshakes. It was great. Thick enough to stand a spoon in, and plenty of real peanut butter. It's not so sweet that one can't enjoy it as an accompaniment to to the sliders and dog, instead of dessert.

It's not too often that a place lives up to its own hype, but the Chicago Hamburger Co. was everything that I was craving and more."}
{"text":"Chicago Hamburger has great sliders. The cheese slider add gardiniera peppers is the best. It is great to go to a place that has great service, great food and just a good old fashioned atmosphere. 

I have also had the cheddar Burger here and that is fantastic. Real cheddar like back home. Ask for that on the side with your fries. Really good stuff."}
{"text":"Always spot on! You order at the counter and they bring your food to your table. I always get the sliders with cheese and French fries. Lots of Chicago memorabilia all over the walls. Great food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Look at all these 5 stars!!! Staff is always working hard, owner has a great place and even better food. Amazing cheap sliders west of Chicago. Thank you for always making me full when I leave for an affordable price. Favorite local joint!"}
{"text":"Great Hot dogs, amazing chocolate banana peanut butter shake, and garlic fries are awesome. You would think I'd weigh a lot by the sound of it. lol 
This place is a Dive that is a best kept secret. The owner is a down to earth hippie kind of guy. He's always accommodating and friendly. :-) We frequent this place often and have always enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Every Saturday my father would take me here when I was a kid and I would always order the same meal, cheeseburger, side of cheese fries, and a medium coke. As an adult this order has never changed. I highly recomend this place to anyone who wants to indulge in a good burger. My one regret so far is I still have yet to try a slider from here. Also the cheese fries are amazing! Enjoy."}
{"text":"I am a giant fan of Chicago Hamburger Company's sliders, with cheese.  After five or six you can get a bag of 10 for 10 bucks. Can't say I've ever made it past six... but I certainly have tried.

I truly believe that I may have been able to tolerate the weather here in PHX a little better for all this time knowing that this place is also here. Also, the fries are the perfect combo of crispy and potato'y and always served blazing hot. Wife is a big fan of the chili cheese fries- super delicious. Also try the banana shake.

I hope they have something like this place in the afterlife. In my mind they are tied for best slider in the USA with White Manna in Hackensack NJ."}
{"text":"A must if your interested in legit Sliders. Plenty of other menu items will not disappoint. Plenty of interesting Chicago memorabilia. Mayor Daly campaign Poster? Put it on you Culinary Bucket List!"}
{"text":"Amazing for what it is...sliders and the banana shake can't be beat...best shake in arizona. Spend the extra 60 cents for the banana upgrade."}
{"text":"Oh man, if you don't especially like your heart  (or at least can justify it by working out after), this is an awesome place.  I've been extremely skeptical of \"Chicago\" places here in the valley, because most are bad impressions, at best.  This place doesn't *quite* get it, but it's the closest I've found in Phoenix.  

Of course, they've got the Chicago street signs and sports posters.  Hey!  Southport!  I lived right by there!  In case you missed the name of the place, they like reminding you by filling your vision with schtick.

The sliders, which aren't really known as a Chicago thing, are really good, and quite cheap.  These are really tasty little burgers that make an inexpensive meal.  

The italian beef, which *IS* a Chicago staple, just isn't quite right.  I think I figured out what it is.  The beef isn't sliced thinly enough and they don't use enough spices, which makes for a store-bought kinda feel to it.  

Props for the tasty milkshake, though.  

I really, really want to find a place in Phoenix to get a beef sandwich.   My search did not end here.  

I am Sean's unfulfilled yearning."}
{"text":"This place is great. Exactly what you expect. Tons of Chicago teams memorabilia on the walls, dogs, sausages, and sliders. Bratwurst on Wednesdays and Saturdays (which is my favorite). A couple of TV's with sports on. The French fries are great always super fresh and crispy, and everything else is made to order. If you can't make it on Wednesday or Saturday for a brat, I love the Firedog and the Polish Sausage. Plenty of seating, parking can be hard to come by during the lunch rush though. Friendly, courteous staff. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"My exec recommended this place to me and man was he right! Best burger I've had in a long time. Counter service which is still super friendly and while I had to wait a while for my meal, it was certainly worth it. Anyone looking for a huge tasty burger at a very reasonable price should check this place out."}
{"text":"I went here last night. I was SOOOO excited to FINALLY go to The Chicago Hamburger Co.. I have been driving past that place ever since I was little, but never got to go in. 

Well last night was the night. The hubs and his friend Josh have both gone a few times and rave about how awesome it is. I HAD to go! 

Well....It wasn't what I expected. I will give them that the service was friendly and we had our food in about 10-15 minutes. They were pretty busy, but it came quick. 

I got two double meat cheese sliders. I was only able to choke down one. The meat was not good at all, it tasted sour. The buns were really mushy. The grilled onions tasted like they had been made days ago and warmed back up. I pawned off my other burger on the hubs. 

We all split a couple other things because I wanted to try it all. 

The cheese fries....GROSS. They were soggy...like the fries tasted soggy before the cheese was ever put on. And the cheese had ZERO flavor, I wanted to dump salt and pepper all over it to give it some sort of flavor. anything. 

The Frito Pie...Now I was way stoked that they had Frito pie on the menu. There used to be this hot dog cart in this industrial area that had bomb Frito pies and I hadn't had one in about 7 years. Well, the chili was disgusting. In all my life I have never had chili like the Chicago Hamburger Co. It tasted like a bag of sugar accidentally got knocked over into the chili as they were making it and they just let it ride. So so sweet...so un edible. 

The Onion Rings...They were good. Nice and crisp. Really thin though and the batter they use isn't very special at all. But I would eat them again and be happy. 

Over all....Its mediocre. I would never ask to go back, but if the hubs really wanted to go there for sliders again, I would go and try something different. They have a turkey burger which sounds good. 

Sorry Chicago Hamburger Co I really really wanted to like you."}
{"text":"Damn good sliders and polish.  Says it was given best fries award but I didn't see anything great about them.  My only gripe would be that I didn't get any peppers on my polish but I didn't know I had to ask for them.  Id definitely go back and explore the menu it was tasty."}
{"text":"Was craving sliders and saw this place on Yelp so decided to give it a shot. The staff is friendly and the place is clean. I ordered 2 double sliders with cheese and chili cheese fries. The fries were ok, I do like that they put actual beans in their chili (as a Texas boy I grew up having it that way) but overall lacked flavor. The cheese is cheese sauce but was a little bland for my taste. Some of the fries were slightly undercooked but the order came out hot. Not sure what happened there. On to the sliders. As most reviewers of the sliders (I assume) I am basing my experience with White Castle, which by no means did I grow up eating but have had the chance to try a few times. These sliders are better in my opinion in comparison. Then meat is seasoned right and the onions are mixed in thoroughly with the patty. The bun was fresh and soft and the slider itself is topped with just the right amount of cheese. I definitely will be back for those Windy City Sliders, overall a 3 star review because the fries didn't quite hit the mark for me."}
{"text":"Back in the day, my daughter loved to come here for the peanut butter shakes and a bite o' meat.

Yesterday, a chili cheese dog was a supermarket frank with canned, soupy chili and a tab for $7.85 (root beer in a styrofoam cup included).

Atmosphere? None. Stuck-on mirror tiles with gold particles? Aplenty."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Chicago Hamburger Company for 20 years. It's a cool spot for a date and I consider it as \"my spot\". I remember as a kid going playing the baseball pinball machine game with my Dad. My Dad is from Chicago so I've been to all the deep dish pizza places, hot dog places and Italian beef places but this place is BY FAR better than any Chicago restaurant. The owner does give aways when Chicago teams win championships. There are always sports on the TV's. The Italian beef is fresh and amazing. The hot dogs are amazing. (Real Chicago hot dogs with the neon green relish, celery salt and request the sport peppers) Get some cheese fries and a big soda too. When you go inside they have a bunch of cubs gear as well as anything in Chicago for sports like Jordan wheaties boxes and an 85 Bears team pic. I am a regular here and the staff is family run (always the same people working here) I am a die hard Bears fan, Cubs fan, love the Bulls and this is the spot to be for that. I love coming here and will always go back. It's by Camelback Mountain so it's fun to get a hot dog to go with cheese fries and go to camelback driving to the top and eating the delish food. If you are from Chicago or a Cubs fan visiting stop by and enjoy the vibe! This is my favorite restaurant in Arizona and just anywhere really"}
{"text":"They close at 8 but will serve the person in front of you if they know them and the doors are unlocked at 8:30. Oh, and while the place is packed and you're not the only on in live willing to pay. A+ customer service."}
{"text":"Okay, if you're a fan of Chicago anything, this is your spot.  You could honestly spend all day here and still find something new to look at.  The owner obviously misses his hometown but he found a way to bring it to Phoenix and he does it with a smile.  We tried both the Chicago sliders and the Chicago dog.  The sliders were okay but probably nothing I'd order again.  They come in the White Castle style and I'm sure those who grew up eating that get a sense of nostalgia with them, but I grew up in SoCal with In n Out, so hey....moving on to the Chicago Dog.  It was honestly one of the best I've had.  So delicious and authentic with the poppy seed bun, bright green relish, sport peppers, etc.  I would definitely return to have another one of those along with the fries, which were pretty darn good themselves."}
{"text":"I just went tonight for the first time and I thought it was pretty good. I got the double cheese sliders and fries. The only reason I knew of this place is because I drove by there a few times. Tonight I wanted a good burger and decided to give it a try. 

It's not quite like the White Castle variety, these patties seemed thicker, but still - pretty yummy. :)"}
{"text":"Hamburgers fries and milkshakes are always great at this place. Prices were reasonable and it was close to the house."}
{"text":"When I first lived in AZ I lived and wrked just up the street so this was one of those places that was great to hit.  We used to just call them Windy City Sliders.   Oh my gosh, fast forward more than 30 years  and I'm driving by after making a delivery to my vets office and I see this place.  Nostalgia hit and I had to drag my son in here.  He wouldn't understand but he might appreciate the place.
I will say the expansion (?), location, or could it be the popularity of hamburgers that continues to draw a good crowd.  I don't recall it ever this busy.
During weekday lunch hours parking is atrocious.  Street parking seems limited too.
Service is efficient and quick to answer any questions.  Food is cooked to order and then your number is called.  I had to go with the usual, a slider.
Small, thin beef patty with chopped onions, pickle, mustard, catsup, and cheese if you're doing a cheeseburger.  The bun is nothing more than a dinner roll.
Still as good as I remember but I wouldn't call it great.  
It was a lot of special memories brought to the front burner just stopping in hear.
Whatever happened to California Coolers and the original Bartles & James?"}
{"text":"My mouth is already dripping just thinking about the last time I ate at this joint!

I remember it as if I was sitting there now.... grilled diced onions, shredded lettuce, salty-but not too salty pattie, the magic dressing (pretty sure it's thousand island) and dripping on my paper lined little basket full of just fried fries drizzled with ketchup and salt.....Oh, my treadmill beware.
Last time I went we all enjoyed it and my guest even bought a guac burger to go after he finished his already huge burger.  It's addicting.

Decent prices and good food over ride the parking, which does suck. But the only reason is because it's soooo good.  Even on weekdays during dinner time.  DO NOT go during lunch hour without phoning in your order, trust me unless you have an hour lunch and work close by and don't mind eating a messy burger at your desk!"}
{"text":"Ive been coming here for over 30+ years!! i remember coming here all the time as a kid when id visit my grandparents house.
Still great sliders and dogs and also fries. Kids love the frito pie.  Moved back a month ago and already been here a few times. Go Cubs Go !! Bear Down!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice in one week. I come here for my White Castle fix there sliders are pretty close.  If your from White Castle country you have to try these."}
{"text":"Always super good. Sliders and dogs are on point and the customer service is top notch. Great place to grab a quick meal"}
{"text":"I am from Chicago and I feel places should be care full about trying to title there places with anything CHICAGO in AZ. Those are mighty big shoes to fill! With that said this place is totally over rated...I mean We got a hot dog served as a sandwich....NOT IN CHICAGO!!! For this I will stick to what the Valley is  known for and go to In and Out or Lenny's!!! Quit it!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My second visit and got just what I wanted. Had the cheesesteak with the gianarea cooked in. I wish the cheese would've either been more melted or a sauce. Fries are great."}
{"text":"I've been in Metro Phoenix for 8 Yes, why did I not know about this place sooner?? Food is great, sliders...OMG, blindfold me and I would swear they were White Castles. I love all the memorabilia...well except for the White Sox stuff.  All kidding aside, really enjoyed our visit, food and conversations."}
{"text":"Great Chicago dog and awesome sliders for a decent price. Love the Chicago memorabilia decor all around the place."}
{"text":"I was craving some back home love and stopped in at CHC.  I had 2 dogs, everything, xtra sport, fries, Pepsi. Just like home, what else do u want me to say?  I didn't try sliders but will do next time.  Chicagoans can breathe easier when in PHX."}
{"text":"Was craving a dog and a burger so I checked Yelp. This place wasn't far so I gave it a shot. I ordered a bratwurst combo with fries, a soft drink, and two sliders with cheese and all the fixings. 

First let me say the sliders were not as good as I hoped. The meat tasted like it was processed/frozen. Just a subtle institutional taste. Disappointing from a place that specializes in hamburgers. They're a little bigger than what you'd typically call a slider. It was better than a Mcdonalds burger, but not what I'd call restaurant quality. For a buck each they're not a bad value, but I've had better. 

However the fries were good. Fairly thick, but crispy outside and fluffy on the inside. It was a generous portion. More than I could eat. The bratwurst was great with mustard and sauerkraut. It made the meal. I might go back sometime to try a shake and a hotdog, but I doubt I'd order another burger."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, staff and atmosphere! The line was basically out the door but the wait was well worth it. The sliders are to die for and the cheese fries just YES. Was my first time there but I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Fantastic fast service - good food and service - good quick bite for lunch had a 2/3 burger the first visit - wonderful and the Italian beef - good (little heavy on the peppers)"}
{"text":"I have never eaten bad food here.  My favorites are the wings, any of the sausages, and the sliders. They also have some of the BEST milkshakes. The ppl are always friendly here. I have been going to this restaurant for years and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Order the 1/3 lb burger.  The best burger I have ever had. The bun is very fresh.  I will be back.  You need to eat here!!!"}
{"text":"I'm really trying to cut back on handing out 4 star reviews, but as I relive my experiences at Chicago Hamburger company, I am torn. i hesitate to give this joint 4 stars, because at the end of the day, its a greasy food spot that does a couple of things well. It's a really great Chicago style hot dog; probably the best thing on the menu. 

The burgers aren't anything special. Its not as if its a fresh or anything and pretty much a run of the mill burger joint. The sliders are awesome because they're cheap and they have that \"slider burger\" taste from a greasy food spot, you know what i mean? its great because its not....if that makes sense. 

the fries were previously frozen, and ultimately just hot potato/oil sticks. but still, i like this place. i know it sounds like a contradiction but it has its merits. and it really is a great hot dog and since it's around-the-freaking-corner I figure I'll be having plenty of them."}
{"text":"Let's get right to it.  The smell of GRILLED ONIONS hits you before you even touch the front door.  That is the definition of a Chicago dog/burger joint.  That IS Maxwell Street.  That IS Chicago.

The Food - I ordered the fire dog, a cheese slider, and fried zucchini.
The firedog didn't let me down in the authenticity department.  Good meat, the correct and required condiments (neon relish, celery salt, sport peppers, tomato, mustard, onion. and seedy seed bun), cooked just right, and it smelled up the office when I opened it.  
The slider was the ex-factor.  I saw 'slider' and immediately thought White Castles.  But I didn't want to compare it to that, so I slapped my head to get the thought outta there.  Its a little burger with mustard, onions, and cheese.  What makes it special is the way the meat's taste melds with the onions, mustard and especially the bun.  Mine had a little too much mustard...and the bun wasn't a player on the field at all.  In fact, the sub-par bunnage took away from the slider.  BUT, I said I wouldn't compare it to Whitey One Bite's (White Castle's), so for what it is...ITS GOOOOOOD!  You will find yourself wishing you bought 2 or 82 more of them.
The zucchini was just filler for the car ride back to the job.  They were greasy and crunchy enough to get me excited at first...but their charm wore off after about 5 of them.  They are little chips of zucchini fried nice and crispy.  The taste of the batter just didn't do it for me, and the flavor of the  zucchini wasn't quite on point.  Doh, I REALLY hate saying anything negative about this place, because of....

The Atmosphere:
You know what kind of place you're in when you open the door.  A joint.  Pure joint.
Chicago newspaper clips, posters, political campaigns, pennants, whatever you can take from Chicago and stick on a wall.  This is the first time I've walked into a Chicago joint and was actually MOVED.  The place made me a little misty.  
I miss Chicago.  
This joint made me remember some of my happier times as a kid, when life didn't suck.
Its the kind of place you go and sit down with your team or with your buddies or with your kids or with your ma or with your worse enemy.  The SMELL OF GRILLED ONIONS makes everything just fine with the world.  Its the kind of place you go after you've just had some kind of fun, or even some kind of heartache.  Its just the kind of place you can go whenever, for whatever reason.  You feel like you belong here; like the world's bitter and evil hands can't reach you here.  You feel...safe.  Sorry to go off on that tangent, but its just something about the actual establishment itself...
Who cares about what the floors look like, or what's in the corners?  Its a joint.  Its got joint floors and joint corners and joint tables and chairs.  Ain't nothing crawling.  Nuff' said.

The Service:
After my nostalgic head-trip back to Chi-Town, I had to let the guy at the counter know they had done right by me.  Not much conversation due to the uncanny line that seemingly popped up out of nowhere behind me.  He told me that when I call in an order, \"Aw, you ain't gotta wait in line, just come on up.\"  That was almost the equivalent of him saying \"I love ya', man!\"  Without the awkwardness.  Oh, when I said I was picking up for 'Mike'...they all went \"Mike's here!  Got Mike here!  Get Mike's order!!!  Let's go!\"  Maybe its a routine, but it makes a guy feel like a million friggin bucks in a recession.  Let's just say I walked out of there feeling 10 times better than I did before I walked in.  And lastly, an elderly lady came in, and they all knew her name.  The guy immediately asked if she wanted something to drink.  I don't know...that just sat right with me.

The Value:
On.  The.  Money.  I kid you not, you got 5 bucks, you can eat...and good.  Get a couple sliders and fries for under 5 bucks.  Or one of the dogs and fries.  You're looking at a little more for an Italian Beef (which I intend to trek back there for), or something like that.  Money is an issue for most people, but you won't hurt yourself having lunch here twice a week.

The Bottom Line:
Despite the lack-luster experience with my zucchini and bun, I must say this:  Go here.  Go here often.  Smile when you get to the counter.  Tell them they have a nice place, even though they already know it.  Eat sliders.  Eat dogs.  Eat Frito Pie (and tell me how it was....while you stand a few feet away from me with that corn chip breath).  Sit down here.  Bring friends.  Bring people you don't know that much.  Bring people you don't like that much.  Just see how things turn out.  Your stomach and mouth will be happy.  Your heart will be happier, but perhaps out of a few years.  Write about it.  Talk about it.  Grab a few menus and stick 'em on the board at work.  
This place is all right.
This place is all right."}

{"text":"I love his place great food customer service is excellent. I showed up an hour after ordering food and he remade it for me! Awesome place! Closest you get to the real Chicago thing!"}
{"text":"CHC Sliders = Evil Tasty Little Devils!!  

DAYUM YOU CHC for not being open on Sundays!  I can't tell you how many times I've suggested CHC for lunch or dinner on a Sunday  to have J remind me they're closed!  DOH!

Gimme about 3 Windy City Sliders - w/ cheese and hold the pickle!  
Decent Fries.  

I think I'm going to have to twist J's arm on a Tuesday to go grab dinner and try their Tuesday Special. 1/3 lb.Cheddar Burger, or Turkey Burger, w/ Fries $6.49 

I don't think I'll have to twist that hard though!  ;)"}
{"text":"I live right down the street and this is one of the best places to swing by (off hours are the best because it's not as busy) and just pick up a bag of sliders to chow down on.  Hadn't heard about the \"Philly style\" cheesesteak; I'm going to have to try that out soon!"}
{"text":"I come every Thursday for their sloppy joes and a root beer milkshake. Everything tastes great!"}
{"text":"This place has Chicago Flair written all over it!!! The inside was filled with sports memorabilia galore from the famous Windy City. Arcadia for me has become an area of Chicago transplants and the food followed.

I had the cheeseburger sliders, root beer float and onion rings. All delicious and left me wanting more. The quality was really good and everything tasted fresh.

I also had their thick shake on my second trip here. I tried the chocolate peanut butter banana milkshake. It was creamy, dense and smooth. The shake was one of the best shakes I've ever had."}
{"text":"The people watching is five stars...the food is just aight. Super crispy zucchini was actually mushy inside. Sliders were fine but nothing to write home about. Fries were ok.
I've heard people rave about this place but like I told my wife...if I was nearby, drunk and starving, maybe I'd want to come back."}
{"text":"I have never been to chicago. But I love chicago food. 

Chicago Hambuger Co. makes me feel like im there. The sliders are pretty awesome. My favorite is the traditional  Vienna Chicago dog. 

With all the chicago decor on the walls. My favorite is the poster of all the things that has happened since the last time the Cubbie won the world series. Its pretty fun to read.

Will be back for the shake or the patty melt."}
{"text":"I think my initial review was a little too harsh. Three visits in and I keep coming back. I think the initial burger just wasn't what I was expecting but knowing what it is I still want to come here and enjoy it just the same.

Tried a Firedog this time and gave the slider another shot. Hit the spot. Place was super busy on a Saturday- had to park around the corner. Friendly, fast service. Slider was still just fair. Fries on point. Hotdog was good.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Lived in Phoenix all my life and just recently came here to eat.  Absolutely delicious.  I got a cheeseburger with everything on it except pickles; the beef was a little pink and the burger was messy...in other words really tasty!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.  Friendly staff, great food, and a solid atmosphere !!"}
{"text":"I've made several visits to the Chicago Hamburger Co, I was initially introduced by a friend who knew that I was originally from Illinois and missed some good old fashioned Midwest comfort food. My first venture there I tried their Italian beef sandwich, which really hit the spot. I got it with mozzarella and a side of red sauce, not exactly traditional but sometimes I just get that craving. It was pretty good on this occasion, the beef itself was kinda average but the bread was PERFECTION and I was pleased. Round two, not so much...it didn't stack up to the initial experience I had. My quest for the classic Italian beef in Arizona will continue elsewhere... Due to the failed Italian beef situation,  on my next visit I got a burger. Good, but nothing amazing. Visit number four found me giving the double cheese sliders a try, and I think I found my mainstay for this joint. While the regular double burger was a bit much and left me feeling like a fat bastard for the next 6 hours, two of these delicious little double cheese sliders did the trick perfectly. The fries are usually on point, I dump a healthy dose of Cajun seasoning on them as a rule. All in all, a pretty cool joint that reminds me why Chicago will always be \"home\"..."}
{"text":"Windy City Sliders (double, cheese, everything!) Large Fry, a side of cheese and a chocolate milkshake has become a Friday night tradition in our house. I love this place! 

Fast & friendly, feels like you're at home even if you're not really from Chicago. :) So many good things to say about this place. 
If you haven't been yet, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? Hurry! 

Just not on Sundays because they're closed."}
{"text":"Really? I've been coming here for years and I haven't written a review for you guys yet? I'm...kind of upset with myself right now. Anyway, moving along.

I used to work down the street from here and even though we were only allotted a half hour lunch, we'd be packed into one of our cars like it was a clown car, take the 15 minute drive out here, stand in line (and there was always a line), wait for our piping hot hot dogs, sliders, and fries, and make the 15 minute drive back. So our 30 minute lunch become more like 45 minutes, but when you offer to take orders from the team and of course, the managers, people tend to turn a blind eye.

Chili cheese dog, sliders (don't stop at one!), and fries. Maybe a shake if you're feeling it. That's my go to order. Sometimes I'll switch it up with a philly cheesesteak but chili cheese dogs are usually what I'm craving when I hit up Chicago Hamburger. The sliders are heaven on a bun. And all of their food is made fresh when you order them, which makes it oh so satisfying when you take that first bite of piping hot goodness. Beyond my usual order, there are tons of other items on the menu, which I'm sure are equally delicious and I really wish I could speak more to them but that'll be a review for next time. And trust me, my mouth is watering just thinking about it."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever. I remember going here as a kid. I usually get a Chicago Dog or sliders with cheese. Bob is great!

Drawbacks..... Parking is a pain, very small parking lot. The place is also a bit small & run down. But don't let that stop you from enjoying the best sliders in town! I drive in from Goodyear to eat here, that's how good they are."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  A true representation of an old Chicago style burger joint.  The food is great and service is good.  No complaints here.  The sliders are amazing and the dog is wonderful too.  You won' be disappointed with this place!"}
{"text":"The Beef Brothers finally made it to Chicago Hamburger Company today for lunch! There was a minor obstacle in our way, motoring from West Mesa to 38th St & Indian School. The cops had blocked off Indian School from around 42nd St to 40th, so we had to pull a detour. 20 minutes of hungry driving later, we made it to this fine establishment. The rain or road closure or whatever had apparently trimmed the foot traffic at CHC down a bit, so we walked right in and up to the order window with nary a wait. Bob greeted us like we were old long lost buddies, we told him we'd never been here, and he replied that they didn't mind rookies one bit! My brother, the Sport Pepper King of Chicago, was merrily bantering with Bob whilst I perused the menu, as if I didn't already know what I was ordering...Peppa King ordered a Beef with Hot, wet, and cheese fries, I a combo (beef 'n' sausage) wet, hot on the side, and a regular fries. 2 sodas.

This place is the bomb! Very cool old Chi stuff everywhere; not your usual Vienna Beef promo crap (altho they do use Vienna), but some really great posters, sports crap, and one I really liked of an old poster for a Jethro Tull concert at the Aragon Ballroom! God, that brought back the memories! Anyway, the food was delicious. The beef and sausage cooked perfectly, placed on Gonnella bread like it's supposed to be done. The hot giardiniera was not very hot, could have been hotter, but still very tasty. The beef gravy or juice was perfection; they dip the bread and give you a side of juice in case you need more! The fries were good, Pepper King's cheese fries were a very large portion and massively cheezy-delicious!

We loved this place; great ambiance, great memorabilia, and a very courteous staff, and Bob, well Bob was the best. He even gave me my fries for free when they were accidentally forgotten on the order. The Beef Bros recommend this place very highly, giving it 9.8 out of 10 Sport Peppers on the Peppa-Meter! We'll be back to try the burgers next!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!!! I had my first Chicago style hotdog here and W O W! Mouth watering!!!! 

My family loves this place specially their sliders, which by the way huge score in my book! They are perfection. You can order them with cheese or without and you absolutely cannot beat the price!  As much as I enjoyed the Chicago style hotdog next time I will ask for light onions (I personally don't like raw onions). 

I've never been to Chicago (one day I will and I will EAT ALL DAY!) but this place felt as if I was in Chicago lol. I wouldn't know the difference of a good Chicago slider or hotdog and a bad one but this surely had my tastebuds dancing their happy dance! 

This place gets quite busy but they are FAST! A must try while in the area."}
{"text":"I was in the East Valley and had to stop after reading the good reviews for real sliders similar to White castle. The order taker was friendly the service was what I expected from a slightly dive hamburger joint in Chicago. I ordered 1 plain, 1 cheese and 1 double cheese slider with everything. About 4 minute wait time and my 3 paper wrapped bundles arrived. I unwrapped them and all were squashed by the wrapping process but they looked similar to what I have been craving. After my first bite the disappointment began to hit me. The flattened buns were huge compared to the thin piece of beef steamed on re-hydrated onion flakes, there was no taste to the meat beside the onion and dill pickle slices. A little seasoning, salt and pepper would have helped, better quality beef and cheese with flavor is missing. I will give them another try when back in the area as they do have the process for making a traditional slider and am hoping it was just a bad day."}
{"text":"I hate to leave a less-than-stellar review for a place that has such positive reviews, but I'm just being real. I came here about a month ago. The interior looks aesthetically busy but like it hasn't been refurbished since it was built. The dining chairs and tables are cheap. The menu is one of those old stencil menus they had back in the 70s/80s and probably hasn't been updated since then, either. I don't find this cute. I had to take off another star. The place isn't dirty but it looks dirty-old and not in a southwest grunge kind of way, more like in a trailer trash kind of way.

I ordered a cheeseburger w/ bacon and fries. The burger tasted fine except .. what is going on with the cheese? There was plenty of it, which I love, but I'm not sure what kind of cheddar  they were using but it seemed powdery or artificial or something. Just that alone made me take off another star.

Even so, I enjoyed the food, and I more or less enjoyed the simple ambiance as I sat there watching people cycle through."}
{"text":"We couldn't have been more pleased! My husband and I finally got around to trying this place after having spoken about it for years. We both got a classic Chicago dog and fries. It was so worth the wait. Totally satisfying! The service was outstanding. They made sure our table was clean. Definitely looking forward to going back when we're on that side of town."}
{"text":"My dad has been going to this place quit awhile now.  I have been lucky enough to go with him a handful of times.  This place will make all Chicago sports fans proud.  A little too much Cubs stuff for a South sider like myself but the food makes it all worth it.  I had the sliders this last time and they were great.  The fries that went with were just as fantastic.  I can't wait till the next time my dad and I can go visit Bob and have a great Chicago experience in the middle of the desert."}
{"text":"I have to begin this by saying that I am not from Chicago.  The midwest, yes, but I have only visited, but given the crowds this place packs in, I had high expectations of the dogs and the burgers.  

My boyfriend said, \"eh\" on the hamburger and I had the same opinion on the hot dog.  Nothing special and I have definitely had better - even at a roadside stand.  The service and atmosphere were great along with the prices, but I didn't feel like any of the food made me want to go back."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and it is now my favorite place to get a hot dog or Polish in the Valley! And the ONLY place I have seen sliders served at!

I have gotten a Polish sausage \"Maxwell St style\" twice now and both were excellent! The sausages were a little smaller than what most places serve in Chicago. What they lacked in size, they made up for in flavor!

The perfect charring, grilled onions, and Sport peppers with just the right amount of heat make the Polish my favorite of all the items on the menu. 

But the sliders... they are amazing! Better than the sliders at White Castle hands down! I would say these remind me more of a mini burger than the sliders at White Castle. But that's not a bad thing! Actual sliders never really seemed like actual hamburgers to me. The sliders at the Chicago Hamburger Company are little, miniature burgers and they are really good! The fries are good too!

The gentleman who takes the orders must be the owner because you can tell he cares that every order is just right! And if you don't order a drink he offers a cup of water, which is classy in my opinion. Sometimes it's the little things that make a difference!

I have already told family and co-workers about this hidden gem on Indian School and 38th St. According to their signage, they've been open for over 40 years! They must be doing sumthin right!"}
{"text":"Good little hamburger shop.  Guacamole burger was good, person at front counter was friendly, & atmosphere good like Chicago.  Had onion rings which had too much batter and not enough onion, but was cooked good and ended up ok.  Overall good for a little hamburger shop, but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Friendly people
Awesome burgers, dogs, shakes, and fries (ask for nails) 
Fun atmosphere 
Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great old school burger joint, love the real milk shakes, greasy fries and great burgers and hot dogs.  Nothing fancy but everything tasty even if it may not be good for you."}
{"text":"Food just OK.  Health inspection was a \"B\".  Doesn't look clean.  Makes you wonder!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I learned to walk. The owner, Bob, makes a fun atmosphere to eat a classic meal. Makes you feel like you're at the ballpark or the stadium. I'll never stop coming back. Sliders and milkshakes...enough said."}
{"text":"I am a carnivore.  There, I said it!  I love burgers!!  So of course when I drove by Chicago Hamburger Co. on my first week here in Phoenix I said \"note to self......MUST try this place!\".  Today marks my second week here in Phoenix and after a long week at my new job, I was hungry.  I picked up my daughter and we headed over.  

First off if you are from Chicago or love Chicago, this is your place!  It is filled with memorabilia from the Windy City.  There are all sorts of street signs and things pertaining to Chicago plastered on the walls.  It's pretty cool.  They have two TV's and of course they had the Cubs playing on one of them!  Go Cubs!!  I like the sports like ambience.  It's nothing fancy at all, just basic tables and chairs and a few booths.  

Now for the food.......Mmmmm good burger!  I had a wester burger.  For you fans of Carl's Jr. Western Bacon Cheeseburger....oh man, this one is far better!!  Real bacon right off the grill and cooked just right, nice and crisp, bbq sauce, cheese, and onion rings to top it off.  The burger was juicy and cooked just right!!  It was one of the best burgers I've had in awhile.  My daughter had a hot dog and scarfed it down and gave it a thumbs up so I knew it was good.  The onion rings were nice and crisp and I liked the batter they used.  Not super greasy either.  Nice!  The fries where crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside...perfect!  They have Pepsi and the other usual sodas.  They also make milkshakes.  I'll have to try one next time.  Oh, and chili cheese fries......omg....I love those!  

All in all this is gonna be one of my go to places here in Phoenix.  YUM!!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out forever, and I finally did last night. The service was great, the staff was really nice and they had a fun pinball machine we played while waiting. The space is completely covered in Chicago memorabilia which helped break the ice into interesting conversation. The food was alright in my opinion. I had very high expectations which might have clouded my judgement. The sliders had tiny patties, but I think that's an eastcoast thing so I won't hold it against them. I had my first Italian beef a few months ago from Portillo's and sadly, the one I had here was just not up to par. The au jus they had on the side was good but I didn't taste any wow factor as I did before. I was excited when I saw that they had garlic fries but they were pretty soggy (even for me and I usually like soggy fries). Everything was pretty affordable and we live close by, so I would come back to try a hot dog, chilli cheese fries or a shake in the future."}
{"text":"Great onion rings, and the sliders are as close as you'll find to White Castle in Phoenix. Lots of Chicago memorabilia for fans of the Windy City."}
{"text":"Solid house to get lunch. All the memorabilia of Chicago posted on the walls is kinda cool.  

I ordered 3 sliders with cheese, fries and a coke $9. The food was good."}
{"text":"Today for lunch several of my associates and I decided we wanted to order take out for lunch like we frequently do. We've never had a problem before today in placing several orders at once. Last I checked making money is a good thing. We called to ask if it's better for us to come in if we have several different orders to place or is it better to give the orders over the phone and pay when we pick it up. The person that answered the phone was extremely rude and did everything possible to deter us from wanting to place an order at all. After going in circles for 5 minutes, he finally said place the order over the phone and pay when you come in.
Once there, the owner came over and sadly he was just as rude and unaccommodating. Our orders totaled over $80 dollars. I guess he didn't want our business.
I'm a huge supporter of local businesses, being a small business owner myself, but when someone doesn't appreciate my business and goes out of their way to be rude, I WILL NO LONGER SUPPORT THAT COMPANY and am thankful for YELP. I frequently use YELP to find new places to try and rely heavily on the reviews. I always pick places where not only is the food rated high but equally important to me is the service!! SERVICE IS EVERYTHING!!!!"}
{"text":"If you like sliders, then this is the place for you! It's certainly not a flashy place. The interior could certainly do with some improvements, but that's not why people come here. People come here for the food. If you're a health conscious type, this place won't be your cup of tea, but if you want delicious sliders at a bargain price, go to the Chicago Hamburger Company. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"1/3 cheddar burger with all toppings.  You wish more places and owner/operators existed like this."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! If I could I would probably eat here every day. Love the kitch sports decor and the staff was nice."}
{"text":"A true Chi-town experience

Getting a real Chicago Dog in Phoenix is more difficult that you would think.  Anyone can throw celery salt and relish on a hot dog.  But to get the real Vienna beef, bight green relish, and soft bun right is an art.  And these folks have it down.

Fun to also look at all the Chicago memorabilia.  My wife, a Chicago girl, ranked this place on par with an authentic Portillos.  The shakes are also a yummy compliment to the meal.  Good prices, too.

Only drawback is that we may take on the Chicago body shape if we visit Chicago Hamburger Co as often as we would be inclined.

Oooh, and I bought one of their t-shirts!"}
{"text":"Love the place, owners good and service. I wish they had coupons or deals.The owners are great, it is like being in Chicago."}
{"text":"I was lucky to grow up on 38th St, because I had this classic burger joint at the end of my block. Whenever I go back home to see my old man, I always stop in to grab a real taste of Chicago. To this day, they still got it!

I recently visited Chicago (the city) for the first time on St. Patty's weekend. I was amazed when I felt right at home, must have been all those lunches as a kid at The Chicago Hamburger Co.

Put me down for 3 double cheese sliders...
Thanks Bob!"}
{"text":"Sad sad example of sliders. These can best be equated to frozen white castle that you microwave yourself from the grocery store, as these are microwaved as well. Definitely not fresh beef grilled in minced onions fresh off the grill like a slider should be. If you lived in Michigan and were lucky enough to ever had Bates or Brays ... this is not even close. I wish AZ had a place like Bates. I can't find one. And White Castle burgers are not real sliders; I don't know why anyone would want to replicate that."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was a little kid and have never been disappointed. I've spent countless quarters on the Pac-Man machine and the crane grab machine. Sliders are top notch, hot dogs are great, and probably the best milkshake I've ever had. Easily one of my favorite restaurants in town."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Chicago Hamburger Co. and you like juicy burgers you need to try this place! Burgers are juicy and thick. It always smells delicious when you walk in. I ordered the western burger and it was amazing!! Also ordered the chili cheese fries which were freshly cooked. Check out this place, you will love it!"}
{"text":"The best slider in Phoenix! Screw White Castle! (we can keep living without them).

I tried the standard Windy City Slider with cheese and onions - Perfection! The buns are heaven sent - nice and chewy! 

The sliders are large and only $1 each (two will fill you up).

You HAVE to try this!"}
{"text":"I definitely got the Chicago feeling at CHC. You will see tons of Chicago memorabilia on the walls. White Sox and Cubs together? 

We had the Sliders and Chili Dog. Both were good, but not quite Chicago standards. Chicago dog needs to be on the menu! That is a must for any hot dog place. The fries were really good as well. 

We will go back again and try to get them to make us that true south side chicago dog.
Great little place at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This place has great burgers. However, last weekend I wanted to try to eat healthier and ordered a side salad along with my sliders and halfway through I found a dead fly in my salad. Disgusting. It will be a while before we return here. Sad because the burgers were quite good, sliders were so-so. But if dead bugs are present in the kitchen, I'm not so eager to eat here again..."}
{"text":"I might not have ever gone to Chicago Hamburger Company if not for the Yelp review by Vincent \"The truth teller\".  Truth be told I was laughing so hard after his \"review\" I knew he was only trying to make a very lame attempt at satire, which as we all know, fails miserably in the hands of amateurs.  If you REALLY want to scream with laughter, read all of his other \"reviews\".  Seriously?  The guy 1-stars every place he eats (11 out of 13 plus a lonely 2-star and 3-star)?  Why does he f***ing bother eating out?  Dude would give his mom 1-star for her best homemade specialty.

So anyway, the silliness this non-review aside, let's check back into reality and see what Chicago Hamburger Company is really about.

First off, I speak from experience.  I lived in Chicago.  I know what Chicago's take on pizza, hot dogs and other foods are like and there's nothing wrong with them.  The foods that made Chicago famous for the most part don't exist anymore - the truth is White Castle is a chain and it is NOT based in Chicago (Columbus, Ohio actually) and they STEAM ground beef and use reconstituted onions.  The best burgers in Chicago are in little dirty locally owned places just like Chicago Hamburger Company (as is true in every town in America), not in the chain restaurants in the wealthy North suburbs some transplant snobs seem to prefer.

So, 100% because of that review I ate there tonight.  The ambience, well for a place like this the word ambience is way too fancy.  It is an old storefront, tiny shop with an order window, a pickup window (although a smiling server hand-delivered every order while I was there) and an adequate number of tables.  The clientele was quite mixed and had a comfortable vibe to it.  The order taker wasn't exactly Mr. Personality but was in no way rude.  My companion and I both ordered double sliders with the works and split an order of fries.  I had a strawberry milkshake.  The burger had that unmistakable Midwest crumbliness to it, the roll was fresh and puffy, the fries were crunchy but soft in the center and the milkshake had real strawberry pieces in it.  It actually had taste.  After I got home I re-read the other reviews by the other person and started to pick up on such terms as banderas and gringos.  Ohhhhhh .... yep, got it now.  So anyway, moving on ....

The bottom line and telling the truth, this is not a bad place for a mom & pop.  It's basic, it costs slightly more than McDonalds (not a lot) and it's run by some nice local people.  Good Phoenix people who probably won't weep if some snowbird's \"sentence\" is commuted and he's banished back to that frigid cowtown somewhere near the cornfields in the middle of nowhere."}
{"text":"Awesome place. How is it I love a place with hamburger in the name for their hotdogs? Oh I cant lie, I order a hotdog and three cheese sliders every time I go, alright and fries, I cant help it this place is too good."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place!  My faves are the single cheese sliders and the frito pie.  The zuccini is also very good.  These little hole in the wall joints are always the best.  Don't judge a book by it's cover!!"}
{"text":"I was hungry and  I saw this place as I was driving by, flipped a U-turn, parked my ride, went and stood in line as it was lunch time for everybody, ordered some sliders, waited 5-10 mins for sliders with fries, got my food, took me about 2 mins to kill those sliders and out I went with a happy stomach. Great fun staff! Great food!"}
{"text":"I just left this place ordered some sliders to be picked up when I got there there was a guy sweeping the floor behind the counter no one greeted me no one spoke to me I stood there finally the guy looks up and raised his  hand up and says just a minute because I'm not important let's keep sweeping the floor because what is the customer then I finally get waited on and the person does not great me doesn't say hello how are you or anything maybe they should put some Chicago people in there and loss some of the south of the border nonspeaking English ones"}
{"text":"Here I go again... on the search for a good hotdog spot to get my chili dog and fried food fix. My chili dog was pipping hot, so that was a good start because apparently that is hard to find. The chili leaned more on the tomato sweet side and that is not my preference, but it was good. I ordered onion rings and I think they were beer battered style, again, not my preference but they were okay. 

The hubby got his normal dog with mustard and ketchup and was pleased, but felt like the pricing was too high. He also ordered cheese fries and they came out undercooked and unsalted. I also think they should put the cheese on the side, so the fries don't get soggy. 

I'm still on the look out for a good chili dog I don't have to drive 30 mins to."}
{"text":"Okay so I come to this place maybe once a month and every single time it is the exact same... perfect. The service is great, food comes out real fast and the meal is hot and delicious. I highly recommend this place for anyone!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try out this place but it is just not good. Decor is tiresome and food is tasteless. Pretty affordable and service is alright but still not worthwhile to give another shot."}
{"text":"You guys, this was better than In-N-Out Burger.

I had two cheese burgers sliders and a super-thick vanilla shake.  We split some fries.  It may have been my favorite meal in Arizona!  The quality of it all was fantastic.  We stayed until closing (it's only open until 8pm, closed on Sundays) devouring it.  This place may not look like much on the outside, but inside you're transported to Chicago.  If I come back, I'll try a hot dog!  They have beef franks that look awesome."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in the area I stop by for a couple sliders. They have had the same staff for many years, which proves that the owner treats his employees as well as his guests. Great piece of Chicago here in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I have been going past this place wanting to try it for a while but never made it in until last night.  I ordered the sliders because it's called Chicago Hamburger Co for a reason.  I got two double's with cheese.  They were really good and just hit the spot.  I got an order of onion rings and a chocolate malt to go with them.  I love how this place has malts not too many places make them anymore.  This place is what it is a great burger place that is not for the health conscious people but hey they aren't trying to be."}
{"text":"I notice stuff.  I've been here dozens of times over the years and the owner seems to recognize I am a repeat customer.  Sitting here today enjoying my sliders I hear the phone ring and he answers and says, I have a line at the register, are you phoning in an order.  Then he says, I'll have someone get your call as soon as I can and puts them on hold.  How many times have you been standing in front of someone to be helped and the phone rings and all of the sudden you just got bumped while their issue is handled before yours?  I enjoy the food and really appreciate the attention to and awareness of what is right.  I'm not from Chicago and given its current state of crime and violence, I'm good coming here for a sammich."}
{"text":"Do you like sliders?
Yup, I do too! I admit it, as much as l enjoy fine dining, I really do have pedestrian tastes.
You can only eat eat so much pate and stuffed breast of duck before you need something real.
I know sliders are everywhere these days. I live near Stax and I like it fine. 
I see sliders on the menu so many of the other places I go, but these...these are really sliders and they are really great and really just what god and nature intended when ground beef was created! 
Small, delightful chunks of bovine goodness!
Plus, Chicago Hamburger has some of the best chili fries around to go with the sliders, and that really makes the drive, and the poor parking at lunch and the difficulty finding a place to sit at lunch and all the rest (I actually feel like I'm in Chicago) worth the effort!
The regular burgers and the hot dogs are pretty good , too (bright green relish and celery salt for the dogs, so good for them), but really...sliders are the reason to go to Chicago Hamburger."}
{"text":"Been here dozens of times. Never had a bad experience. Owner is always there with a smile and food is solid. Earned another loyal customer."}
{"text":"I know this place is called Chicago Hamburger Co but what really shines here is their Chicago Style Hot Dogs. Hot dogs are one of my food weaknesses, I absolutely love a good hot dog and this is my hot dog spot! To top it off, it's like a 5 minute drive from my house, awesome yet dangerous. 

You can never go wrong with their basic Vienna Hot Dog or their Windy City Sliders. The best part is that all of their hot dogs come with french fries so you don't even have to ask. All under $6 I might add, it's a steal of a deal! If you like a little heat or spice like me, then I would suggest ordering the Fire Dog. It's a Polish dog with cayenne peppers in the sausage. It's not too spicy where your eyes are watering but it gives the sausage a nice kick. 

They used to have a \"Smokey Dog\" as a special item to order that was a smoked sausage with grilled onions and cheese on it which was heavenly!! It was everything you want in a sausage. I went back recently and they no longer had the item because not enough people ordered it. So, if for some magical reason it reappears on the menu, be sure to order it!! Or even better, go in and ask for it anyway, the more people ask, the better chance they bring it back! I want my Smokey Dog!!

I've also tried the Philly Cheesesteak which comes piled with beef. It was a nice change-up from my usual order and it was on special that day. Each day of the week the have a different menu item on special. Their prices are incredibly reasonable and their staff is always friendly. The parking can get hectic when it's a busy time so be prepared for that. Now...can someone bring me a hot dog?!"}
{"text":"K was feeling the urge for sliders. We each got 4 sliders @ $1.20 ea. Plus fries. $2.69. The owner was working the counter & explained to K that the sliders normally come with onions, pickles & spicy mustard. We opted for no spicy mustard.
The sliders reminded me of those we got in Chicago. K said they did the job of transporting her tastebuds back to the windy city. The fries were old school style, crispy but could've used a bit more salt. I think this place did a solid job.
Chicago style sliders with old school fries, pleasant atmosphere. 4 Stars"}
{"text":"I've spent a good amount of time in Chicago and I've had my fair share of Chicago dogs in my life, but I can honestly say that none compare to this joint's Chicago dog. Been going there since 06' and I think they have the best food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food tastes good. Unfortunately I had forgotten that my stomach wasn't doing too well.  I had originally posted that I had gotten sick from the food but this is my post edited. I simply did not put two and two together.

The service was great, by the way and in the future I need to be careful when I have a pre -existing digestive bug."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never posted a review on the Chicago hamburger co. It must be true....we DO have a tendency to take the best things in life for granted. 1st timer? Can't go wrong with sliders and fries. Pretty sure there are magic unicorn chefs steam cooking the juiciest most flavorful sliders you've ever experienced in the kitchen. The owner is always working the counter (cool dude in the bandana), and never fails to express gratitude for stopping in even though there's always a steady flow of customers coming in. Other highlights include hot dogs, shakes, full size burgers and Italian beef."}
{"text":"reminds me of back home in Chicago. Love the atmosphere, great greasy food. But they even have turkey burgers!"}
{"text":"First time here and the staff was very friendly and helpful with the menu. We had some sliders, Chicago dog and the Italian beef sandwich. All were very good. We will be back if we are in the area!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Chicago Hamburger? Co since I was a kid and this place does not disappoint. This is not fancy food, but it's good food. The sliders are tasty...the Chicago dogs are perfect (Vienna beef...neon green relish.... sport peppers.... perfection). The garlic fries are INSANE! Sooooo much garlic. They even have root beer floats. Prices are reasonable, two people could easily eat here for under 20$. Try this little piece of Chicago in Phoenix....you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago so to have a small taste of Chicago here in Az is amazing 

The staff is extremely friendly, the place is always clean. The food is always good can't go wrong with a Vienna hot dog. We were in Chicago for the summer and for some reason I still craving these hot dogs.  We've been going here for the last 5 yrs and will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"When I crave Krystal sliders I come here. The Chicago Polish Hotdogs and Fries are also delicious. It's also clean and the staff has always been courteous and professional. They always have a line so you know it's the bomb. I never have to wait long for my order. If you're from Chicago and you miss home. This is your spot."}
{"text":"If you're a Chicago Cubs fan, this place is for you. This place has limited parking, but I was able to find a place. I am not a sports fan by any stretch, but I loved all the Sports memorabilia. Add to that authentic road signs and replica advertisements and this place has great vibe.  After gazing at everything on the walls, I was greeted by a great guy. I got the feeling of warmth and hospitable. I love that, since hospitality is lacking in many a place these days. The chili dog eating maniac I am, I ordered... you guessed it, a chili dog. For $5.55, I was expecting one of those 1/4 lb hotdogs, but, I was wrong. Granted, the portions were huge. My fries were perfect, golden brown and crisp. The wiener itself wasn't very big at all, but the portion of the meaty, hearty chili was enough to make up for it. I love the poppy seed bun too. That was a unique surprise. 

Now, I've been through Chicago many times on my tours of duty, but never spent time visiting or trying their cuisine. I only give 4 stars for this one reason... I wasn't crazy about the chili. I love the heartiness of it and the portion. However, though I taste an underlying hint of cumin, it is the overpowering sweet and tanginess of it I'm not too crazy about. I dare to say, I think it's Apple Cider Vinegar. Not sure if it's a family recipe or a Chicago thing, but I'm just not too crazy about that. 

All that said, I will go back. My overall experience was a great one, and frankly, they have more items to choose from. I liked it, and no doubt, you will too."}
{"text":"Lord Nelson's Trouser's, this IS a tasty burger!

I'm a NY native (originally from the UK), and have travelled far and wide but THESE are the best sliders I have ever had!

The prices are low, grease is high, ambiance and arcade/pinball machines make it an utter paradise for a quick bite!

Now I wish to travel to the Arizona Territory again to taste these heavenly pieces of bovine.

No matter, my review shall suffice for now!

Good show, chaps!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years and it's consistently great.  Nothing fancy but good, down home (if you're from Chicago, which I'm not) eats.  Sliders are the way they're supposed to be, brats are perfect and the fries are the best.  Real pinball too."}
{"text":"What a great greasy spoon.  If sliders are what you are craving this place will satisfy your cravings.  Chili cheese fries were really good too.  I would have given it five stars but service was a tad bit slow.  Really good food and overall staff friendliness"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Did the daily special. Parking at this place is really the only problem."}
{"text":"This place is an institution of nostalgia! You can put up your picture on the wall and come back 15 years later and it will still be on the wall. The same staff has been there forever and they are all great. Get the fries extra crispy and with cheese sauce. You would think the food would slide downhill after so long but I have never not enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Been eating hete with clients and friends for over a decade.  Italian Beef with spicy veggies on top is amazing and my favorite.  Sliders and chicago dogs are good and fresh and well priced.  Must try if you got a few minutes for lunch!!"}
{"text":"You got to like the Chicago way to enjoy this place. I'm talking about having your dog and \"dragging it through the garden\". The sliders are what you come here for, but I'm partial to the Brat, served on Saturdays. Pretty solid dog and burger spot right in my hood. It made me think that PHX does actually get a good mix of culture from across the country/world. My top spot in the valley for Hot dogs would still be Ted's, but this is my pick for Sliders."}
{"text":"Went for the Brat 'n' Fries special today, and it was okay. Who thinks frozen fries, fried in hot grease is okay...well, the ketchup helped. I'm trying the onion rings next time, and maybe go with the burgers, but then no, I came for a Chicago Dog. The \"Special\" sign swayed me to go with the brat, and since I live down the street, I'll go again, but if it wasn't for that fact, I'd go somewhere else.

There's a lot to choose from on the menu, and the Chicago memorabilia is fun to check out, but how many times can you be interested in the wall deco...once, I'll wager a side of greasy fries on.

A note on the men's restroom. It was built for a tall dude, and there are now codes that dictate how high to mount a urinal and soap dispensers...just sayin'."}
{"text":"Great spot for authentic Chicago sliders in Phoenix. I have been coming here for many years but have not been here in a long time. Same great quality food fast friendly service. If you're missing Chicago style food you have to hit this place up"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the hot wings here. The sauce is really good and lately the only place I go to for my wings. They are always very nice and accommodating to my special requests. I get wings with no drum sticks and extra sauce. Their Chicago style hot dog is so far the best I can find out here in phoenix. Love em'"}
{"text":"I used to work in the area and some folks from work invited me along.  How sad is it that without that intervention I might have never known about the Chicago Hamburger Co?  So sad... So sad...

It's not a big place (ok, it's a dive, but a great dive) and their parking gets really full at lunch time.  Try to go during more \"off\" hours your first time.  Once you know how good it is, you'll be willing to park as far away as needed.  You walk up to the counter/window while perusing the menu on the walls.  I've never not had a super friendly person taking my order.  Sometimes it's even the owner. 

They've got more of a food selection that you might think.  Hot dogs, burgers, sausages, turkey, chicken, roast beef, fish, veggie burgers, cheese steaks, wings, salads, fries, onion rings, shakes.  My friend knew he'd love the place as soon as he saw \"Frito Pie\" as an option.  You can check out their full menu at http://www.chicagohamburger.com. And yes, those are current prices. Less than $4 and you've got a nice meal.  For $5 a feast.

Amazing hot dogs.  Standard burgers can take a few minutes because they are being freshly made - but SO worth the wait.  I haven't seen anyone not love what they got.

I can not come here without getting sliders.  Won't happen.  Ever.  And why you may ask?  Because they are better than White Castle.  I know what you're thinking (Oh NO she Didn't!!!) but yes, yes it's true.  Their buns are amazing.  They manage to be light and fluffy, yet thick and dense.  I can't explain it - but I don't have to.  For less than a buck you can have your own w/ Cheese.  Good luck eating just one.  I'll get one - if I'm also getting a hot dog.  But most folks get at least 2 or 3.  I witnessed someone eat 6.  Well, 5 1/2 - but he did better than I had expected.

We normally get one fry and one onion ring because they are both SO yummy it's hard to pick.  Fries are cut thin and Rings are cut medium-thick.   Oh yea...

For anyone that has ever loved a shake - you must have one here.  I tried a friend's strawberry shake as we were headed out the door, and immediately turned around, got back in line and ordered my own.  Since then - we have come by to get sliders and shakes many times.  And we live 20 minutes away.  They are that good.

Oh yea - tons of Chicago stuff on the walls, tv always on showing \"the game\" and there is a pinball machine and a Ms. Packman.  Waca waca waca...."}
{"text":"I work pretty close by and it has been a great place to pick up lunch. I usually call it in and they have it ready in less than ten minutes. My only problem is they have so many great choices on the menu that deciding on lunch is a struggle. I always like to get at least one cheese slider.  I can vouch for the Polish and Fire dogs. They come wrapped with fries so you really dont have to order any. I've had the Italian Beef.  The bbq beef, the western burger and a cheddar burger. All hit the spot. It seems like they use a cheese wiz and its different but its good. There shakes are good too I just don't remember what flavor I had. That was the only thing that I thought was a little overpriced so I've only ordered it once."}
{"text":"Not Worth the Drive for a Chicago Style Dog...

I had a craving for a serious Chicago Style Vienna Beef Hotdog. I searched for options on the internet, and read reviews for various places around town. Places way out in Mesa and Gilbert were an awful long haul for me, especially since one can never be sure how the reviews will actually stack up against the reality once you arrive and try the food. So I decided to make the relatively short drive over to the Chicago Hamburger Company.

I had my first Chicago Style Vienna Beef Hotdog in Chicago, back in about 1986. I love the \"pop\" when you bite into the hotdog, and the flavors of the relish, peppers, and other ingredients that make a Chicago Style Hotdog what it is - especially with Vienna Beef inside. I have repeated the experience in Chicago over the years, and when living in the Minnesota, I found great places to go to relive those experiences. Fast forward to Arizona. 

I've had experiences that were close, but not quite there. I arrived at Chicago Hamburger Company hoping for the real deal.

Even as indicated in the ratings, this is not a place to go for pleasant ambiance. It is strictly you order food at the window, they make food, you take it with you, or sit at a fairly clean table to eat it. No frills, just hopefully, the taste you came to enjoy.

The menu was straightforward. There was no line, so I ordered my Chicago Style dog, and because they might be interesting, garlic fries. My food was brought to me pretty quickly at the table I had chosen by the front windows. I was glad I had gotten there when I did, because a line had formed, and was getting longer by the second. 

The fries were loaded with garlic, which is a good thing, but the fries were so heavy and greasy that after eating two, I had to toss them. Good idea, but way too heavy. 

My Chicago Style Dog had all of the right ingredients, including the poppy seed bun. The hot dog, however, lacked flavor and there was no \"pop\" biting into it. I'm guessing that the hot dog sat in hot water for too long, and that the flavors were leached out and the texture compromised. For all the great toppings, that Chicago Style Dog was a bust. I ate it, but the experience was disappointing. 

They had a sign up proclaiming their home made milkshakes, so I decided to try one to overcome my disappointment. I ordered banana, and only had to wait a couple of moments for it. As I drank it on my way home, I thoroughly enjoyed it, although it didn't quite fill the void left by the disappointing Chicago Style Dog,

I'm going to guess they are called\" the Chicago Hamburger Company\", and not \"The Chicago Style Hotdog Company\" for a reason... Maybe one day I'll go try a burger - but not another hot dog."}
{"text":"Went here on my birthday for lunch the other day. There is nothing fancy I can say here at all except just REAL GOOD FOOD! I will be back when i feel like eating bad for you food."}
{"text":"I had high expectations because I'm born in Illinois and KNOW how Chicago gets down in the culinary arena.  This little place did not disappoint! My boss (from Chicago) offered to pick up carry out for us.  I ordered the cheese sliders, fire dog, and a fresh banana  shake. The sliders were like gourmet White Castle burgers, if you never heard of those burgers, imagine soft bread, onions, and flavorful meat, steamed to cheesy perfection. And if you still can't image just know they're perfect! The fire dog was really good, not too spicy, I liked it but would probably explore other toppings. The shake is worth the extra $0.60 for fresh bananas... I should have ordered a large!  I will definitely order from there again!"}
{"text":"The place has an awful smell, the condiments table is super dirty, and my Chicago beef was lackluster"}
{"text":"I'm rating the turkey burger. First off I think their price of $5.10 is definitely worth the 1/3 lb of turkey burger you get. Every time I receive my order I forget how large this is. I almost have to save some for later. I've also had their garlic fries. They warn you that they are a little on the heavy side and I appreciate that but personally I prefer the onion rings if I do decide on adding a side to my burger. I've had their shakes which are extremely good but one of my favorite aspects of this place is the service and personality. I love feeling welcomed every time I go. Today I ordered my lunch by phone and when I arrived to pick it up with no wait they had my order ready and the cashier happily announced that \" Yay, Jayme is here for her burger.\" I think the only negative thing I have is the parking. The parking lot is crazy small so when you go during lunch or dinner time it can be a little tough to find a spot without blocking someone in or circling around for a little bit. Thank you guys for your service and good food with a smile! Can't wait till my next visit!"}
{"text":"Never been here before most likely because I rarely get to this end of town.

Had a chicago dog and a couple of sliders.

Dog was good albeit the celery salt was a little salty for my tastes...and I like salt.

Sliders were good...somewhat reminiscent of white castle.

Fries were fries.

Soda was soda.

Overall pretty good.  Would eat there again, just gotta get to that end of town."}
{"text":"although i've eaten my way through half of phoenix, this is my first review. hi all!

went here for lunch on tuesday and since it was my first time, i stuck to the basics and had the windy city slider with cheese, a milk shake and fries. my milkshake was amazing - not too thick or overly sweet and actually tasted like milk was an ingredient. imagine that! the slider was decently sized and delicious. my favorite part was the bun. oh, the bun! now my dream is to sleep on a bed made of those buns.

Chicago Hamburger Co. is the kind of place where you're constantly sneaking glances at and coveting what other people ordered. the owner is awesome. he personally brought our food to the table and made sure to stop and chit chat, even during the crazy lunch rush. 

will i be back? my arteries say no, but my taste buds say YES. and who am i going to listen to? the taste buds every time. i love these kind of establishments and urge everyone to support the business and ignore their arteries as well!"}
{"text":"This place really made me laugh, but mostly because of the weiner hanging from the ceiling.  He has a big happy face along with arms and legs.  How cool is that?  To say this place is bustling would be a serious understatement.  Every single time we have driven by here, there wasn't a parking spot in sight.  When we finally decided to eat here I spotted the parking paydirt right up front.  

Inside is all sorts of kitschy and fun and it will suffocate you with Chicago-ness.  I love the sign that says when a Chicago team wins the world series, free sliders for everyone!  Anyway, the menu is about as simple as it gets, burgers, hot dogs, and some bigger weiners as well.  I got a cheese burger with bacon but only mayo and ketchup.  Despite all the craziness that goes on inside, they are wicked efficient in clearing the ordering line and then they pump through the orders like nobody's business.  My burger was delicious and soooooo juicy.  The cheese was all gooey and melty and the bacon was thick and crunchy.  Perfect!  To top things off, they actual put a decent amount of mayo on it instead of the usual scrape that you get most other places.  I was a happy hamburger eatin girl indeed.  If you want a good no-nonsense burger, stop by here and you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"We drove all the way from Chandler to Phoenix just to get a taste of authentic Chicago sliders/hot dogs. While I was sitting around waiting for the food, this is definitely a fun place for people watching (you know what I mean when you are here). 

The hot dog I ordered and the sliders tasted average (although everyone I know loves their sliders). However, their fried zucchini and onion rings were amazingly delicious. If we are in the general area again, we will stop by and try some other items. The parking is a bit of a pain especially when most people don't know how to park in tight spaces (or in general...smh), but I believe you can park on the street nearby and walk over."}
{"text":"2 stars because I would never come back,  there are better ways to consume 10000+ calories.   

I am sitting in the restaurant writing this review.  I've passed this place several times and the parking lot is usually full.   I figure with 4 starts on Yelp,  it might be worth a try.   I ordered the western burger and fruits.   Maybe I should have tried the sliders.  I'm not sure.   The burger patty seemed like it was pre-made and frozen.   But what really killed this was the bacon that was as tough as jerky.   The French fries were uninteresting.   I wanted to enjoy this so bad.   I'm a little disappointed I came here on a whim,  especially since I had left over Salmon cooked at home.   Oh well...   

I feel like I've been cheated out of \"cheat calories\".   

Return factor: 5%"}
{"text":"Great sliders and awesome for any native of Chicago.  I take consultants there and they love it.  Peanut butter shakes are the best."}
