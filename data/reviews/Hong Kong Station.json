{"text":"I am always excited to hear about new authentic Chinese restaurants in Mad Town. This did not disappoint. I ordered the Cantonese egg noodles in a spicy broth with streaky pork and wontons. The obvious comparison is Wah Kee Noodle, also on my favorite list.  The noodles are equally good, though I didn't like the broth quite as much as what I've had at WKN. The pork was tasty, but my dining partner had beef--it was better. The wontons were quite different from WKN, but both are delectable. And awesomely delicious chili sauce is present on every table in delightful little tins (you have to ask for it at WKN, but whatevs). I loved the atmosphere of Hong Kong Station, from the tin bar signs and classic movie memorabilia to the ducks hanging in the deli case.  Two thumbs way up. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Terrible restaurant. Very dirty. Also have to wait for a long long time... Never come again"}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place, eager to try it, but very disappointed. First off, the ordering process was extremely tedious. Tried to place an order online but frustrating so called in an order instead -- the menu items listed on the website aren't what the man said they were on the phone. More importantly, the food was just terrible. The crispy eggrolls were greasy and the filling was mealy and tasted off. The \"crispy\" pork over rice (listed as a favorite on the menu) was inedible. It was about as far away from crispy as it could get -- gummy, greasy, a mass of fat, with shards of bone. I ended up spitting it out and throwing it away. The Singapore chow mei fun was ok, but rather dry and the shrimp was flavorless. Wah Kee, also in town, has something similar, and it is worlds better. The beef chow fun in black bean sauce wasn't bad, the meat was relatively tender, and the noodles were authentic, but it was still a bit greasy and could have had more flavor. All in all extremely disappointed by this restaurant and won't be going back."}
{"text":"I was so excited when a friend of mine suggested this place for our lunch gathering after hearing rave reviews about the place. It is indeed exciting that there is going to be authentic hong kong food (think roast meat and the likes) along regent, adding and complimenting the wide array of food choices around the area. 

As we had a group of four, a lot of dishes were ordered and I tried all of them. So there are a lot to offer. Let's start with the good: The create-your-own noodles was fantastic. You select a type of noodle from their wide variety, including hong kong style thin or thick noodles, japanese udon, shanghai noodles, mi fen, thin rice noodles, and even pho noodles. Next, you select a broth, they offer beef broth, pork broth and spicy broth. Finally you add your choice(s) of ingredients to your creation. Here you can be as cautious or adventurous as you want, think green vegetables to pork intestines and stomach. This is the best part, the noodles are relatively cheap, almost certainly less than $10 with a decently huge portion unless you choose to add a tonne of stuff to it. If you crave for more carbohydrates, extra noodles is only a dollar more. I tried both the pork broth and the beef broth noodles and they were light and not too salty. Their wonton and chicken wings make great addition to the noodles. 

I also tried the congee ordered by my friend. The texture of the congee is smooth and flavorful, but serving is small. There are places in Madison where you get similarly great congee but double the serving at the same price (or super close). Another dish we tried was the yang chow fried rice. That was oily and fills you up fast because of that reason.

I was also excited by their roasted meat series. Tried the 'double combo', consisting of char siew (BBQ pork) and crispy roasted pork. The char siew is decent, just enough flavor to keep it one of the best traditional classic hong kong dishes. But the roasted pork was way too salty. The skin was salty, the bottom part (where they applied a layer of spices etc to it) was also salty. Wouldn't recommend that unless you love drenching your food in salt. 

Service was meh, you almost always had to call for someone if you needed something. And like a couple of reviews pointed out, having someone in your party who speaks mandarin will be an added bonus to your overall experience. I would probably not be a regular here, but their noodles are worth a subsequent visit for."}
{"text":"I went with my friends last night .it was wonderful. They have a really good barbecue pork .they have a good service provider. And I love the noodles .also i know they make the noodles everyday.it was my first time and I would come back next time"}
{"text":"Yo, this place is really really excellent.  I've only been there for lunch, and I've only tried various custom noodle orders, but man are they good, quick, and affordable.  The place is no-frills from an ambience point of view, but highly authentic and yummy."}
{"text":"The menu was all over the board and it was not clear what the restaurant was supposed to serve. With a name \"Hong Kong Station,\" one would guess that the food would be Hong Kong-style Cantonese; however, the menu does not have a sufficient number of such dishes. \"Small cart noodles\" (???) are served in Japanese-style bowls, and the chef cooks dishes deep inside the kitchen, not in the front of the store in an authentic noodles restaurant.

I ordered Shanghainese fried noodles and the dish was poorly executed. There was insufficient dark soy sauce to make the noodles brown in color, and dish did not have fragrance or heat intensity. The noodles were of the wrong kind - should be rounded and thick, but were flatter instead; the noodles tasted like udon than the real Shanghainese thick noodles. There was a thick sauce, which was totally wrong.

The restaurant calls itself a ???, but the decoration suggests otherwise. The barbecued items also do not seem fresh due to the absence of fragrance.

I suppose that this place would be \"good enough\" for folks who have never tried more authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"Hong Kong station dinning experience overall was really good! The atmosphere was good! The service was also good and helpful! The food was really good it had great flavor and tasted like authentic Chinese cousin! The only complaint I had was that one of the plates of food the BBQ pork was really salty!! 

Overall I would be happy to come again!"}
{"text":"Real Chinese food. Almost cry when I enjoy the Baozai fan. Quite Canton style. For city without Chinatown like Madison, it is a perfect place for Chinese to have dinner, especially in the cozy corner table. Believe me you'll feel like home."}
{"text":"I liked the feel of this restaurant and the service was good (though our server spoke no English). Food did not take long. My dad does not like spice or fatty beef so we stuck with two chicken dishes.  Chicken with basil looked divine with roasted garlic.  The taste was awesome, but it was filled with little break your teeth bones and I could not get over that it just didn't look like any part of a chicken with bone that I could recognize (and I cook entire chickens often). We also ordered the chicken with mushroom. This chicken in this dish came out pink colored again with chips and bits of bone in every bite. It was served on rice that was overcooked and mushy. All that said I would go back and try the soup which was what we should have ordered based on the those sitting around us.  Might opt for the tofu."}
{"text":"Love their ala carte noodle soup menu. The duck is also amazing. Very reasonable price and authentic."}
{"text":"Fujianese boss, shanghainese waitress and hongkongese chef, this place is great for lunch.

Good: fooooood! Noodle soup and rice bowl are awesome. Americans, stop ordering general tso chicken, and try something authentic! Atmosphere and the location are both great, too.

Bad: portion is kinda small for me. Hope they can have some variety in dish size. 

Their service attitude is definitely right, but some of them are inexperienced. One waitress unintentionally made mistakes in check. We found out and the boss fixed it. I suppose it is not too rare for a new restaraunt."}
{"text":"Love this place.The food is awesome. My boyfriend is Cantonese and he said the food is authentic.  We go there weekly. Only flaw is the service. Da waitresses don't know how to wait tables."}
{"text":"Ambiance/service: a hidden gem on Regent street that you would never notice if you didn't take the time to go here. There are limited tables to sit at, but if you have one it's comfortable enough. I only saw one server. She came and dropped a piece of paper and a pencil off for us to mark what we wanted. Not rude, but not overly friendly. Most of the menu was also in Chinese characters with the English translation.

Food: We got the egg rolls which seemed like they might have just been deep fried from frozen, but weren't bad and the beef chow fun noodle dish we had was fantastic! The two of us split it for lunch and it was just about enough!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed at their attitude. I redeemed a coupon from pocket point. When I showed it to the owner he just said: No you cannot use it, I never heard of that.  And I asked him if it is his restaurant on the app and he said yes, but still don't let me use it with a very rude attitude.Seriously??!! I guess this is a stupid owner who doesn't care about reputation."}
{"text":"The best place to get soup in Madison. The Spicy and Pungent soup has tremendous flavor, and there are plenty of options for toppings, all of which have been good and fresh in my experience. It's not overpriced either, as $10 for an authentic and filling meal is well worth it."}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends and was wary of the food possibly being too oily. 

I ordered the Beef Chow Fun, which I should have known would be extremely oily. It was pretty good, but I had to stop eating 1/4 of the way through because it was making me feel gross. My friends enjoyed it though, and one even took the rest home with him.

The rest of my friends all got soup bowls that you can order/customize and really enjoyed all of them. It was a really good choice for them! Not so much for me.

Service was relatively fast! The place is pretty small."}
{"text":"This place is souuuuper fantastic.  From the tight, homey seating to the menu (which has more Chinese text by area than English) and to the food, this is a welcome addition to Regent Street, where we already have the some of the best coffee (Indie), bar (Jordan's), pizza (Greenbush Bar), and doughnuts (Greenbush Bakery).

The exterior sign has been changed since John came last, the exterior looks very clean and open.  We went for dinner and we got the beef in black bean sauce and the pork and eggplant dish.  Both were extremely tasty; the pork and eggplant was served in a small metal pot that kept the food deliriously hot throughout the meal.  Just the right amount of spicy (medium hot) without killing off the other vegetables added to the meal.  Ginger abounds here, and it is a winner.

Next time we definitely have to try some soup/noodles.  They have many bowls in the front case of noodles, and from our experience with their non-noodley foods, it can only go up from here.  You must go here!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a weekday for lunch. Place was busy, but small. The corner table by the window was definitely, err...drafty. The decor is definitely a bit culturally confused. There are beer/liquor signs and old 1950's pinup posters on the walls, a pic of elvis, a poster of James Dean and some I Love Lucy memorabilia. There's also a display window of Asian BBQed goods, which look amazing. 
There's 2 menus, a noodle soup one, where you pick your soup base, type of noodle for $4 and the add on you want for $1 each. They have various choices between vegetables, meat, seafood, tofu and wontons. The other menu is a standard per dish menu.
I got the meat and tarot egg rolls and a noodle soup with pork broth base with Lan Zhou Pulled Noodles, for my add ons; baby bok choy, pork belly and wontons. And a milk tea.
The milk tea was way too sweet. Not bad, just really sweet. The egg roll was ok. Way too much tarot, and it almost seems like mashed tarot, so it was kind of like eating mashed potato egg roll from a texture stand point. Flavor was fine. The soup for the noodles is good. Nice flavor. They have no idea what Lan Zhou Pulled Noodles are, because what I got was not it. Mine was more of a standard ramen noodle bar type noodle. Still good texture, but just not what I had expected/wanted. The pork belly was a bit overcooked and fatty, but flavor was decent. The wontons were just ok, could use more filling/be more consistent with amount of filling. I got one with very little amount and one with adequate amount. Though, as an add on option, I was disappointed only 2 wontons came in my soup. 
Overall, i'd give this place another shot. Maybe i'll opt for their BBQed items next time. They do look pretty fantastic."}
{"text":"On the first spontaneous visit for dinner, I had roasted duck over the rice and something called cart noodle. Duck was pretty small but along with the seasoned rice it tasted awesome. It was the taste I was longing for. Cart noodle was ok, not really special, but considering that it's only $5 I think it's a pretty good deal.

Anyway, I became a fan of HKS after trying their \"Hot Hot Noodle,\" which is basically Ma La Noodle. It's DELICIOUS. QUE RICO! When I'm sleeping, I always dream of their Ma La Noodle where I swim so happily. Their default noodle kind is the thin vermicelli, while you can ask them to change it to thick mixian noodle which I prefer. If you love noodle and spicy taste that paralyzes your tongue, I bet you will love it."}
{"text":"A tiny Chinese restaurant. Food are delicious there and I really enjoy it. Most of the dishes are Southern Chinese food and can remind me of my hometown. However,since there are only 2 people in the kitchen (the couple runs that restaurant), you need to wait for a long time before your dishes are served if the restaurant is crowded, which is very usual on Friday , Saturday and Sunday night."}
{"text":"I have been back to HKS since my first visit. Now I downgrade my rating to 4 rather than 5 stars. 

We have tried various kinds of noodle and rice--the food is consistently delicious. The problem is HKS's service. We waited more than 30 minutes for our meals during busy hours on a Saturday. I in general support family-run small businesses, but they seriously need to improve the overall coordination of the restaurant. It's a mess. 

I also witnessed many communication failures as the servers do not speak perfect English. Be patient, and you will get good food later."}
{"text":"This review is based on only one visit, but man was it a pretty terrible experience. If I return and have a better experience, I'll update this review. As of right now, definitely a 2-star experience.

Three of us walked in around 7:45 pm for dinner. One of my friends had eaten lunch here, and was excited to return. I had heard good things and was also excited to check this place out.

The place was empty. We were the only 3 people in the entire restaurant. It took 45 minutes for some of the food to come out. This doesn't make a bit of sense, but it happened. My friend's order of chicken feet too the longest to arrive, and for something he described as \"alright\", 45 minutes is far too long of a wait. 

I ordered some spicy crispy chicken, which for some reason I thought was \"bone-in\" chicken. Either way, the chicken was not spicy. It was overcooked. It was clearly deep-fried in old oil, as it smelled and tasted faintly of donuts. It was a plate of overcooked, greasy dark-meat chicken. Not worth $12. I picked through it, and my companions somehow chocked down the rest. It was an awful meal, and my friends made fun of me for clearly choosing a \"loser\" from the menu. It truly baffled all of us in it's terribleness.

The other dish ordered was some beef in black bean sauce, which was also described as \"alright\". 

Service was at first very friendly, but then terrible. When you wait 45 minutes for food, you expect the staff to check on you a few times. Nope, didn't happen. Friendly folks, but not so great with customer service.

Also, styrofoam cups?! Really? Any restaurant using styrofoam in 2015 should seriously stop. And why are the wall covered in old beer memorabilia?!

The place was relatively filthy, too. Our table was sticky and the floor was really dirty. The bathroom was okay, and smelled oddly of Red Vines licorice. 

Unfortunately, just a really terrible experience. If I return, I'll definitely stick with the noodle bowls that others have recommended on Yelp."}
{"text":"noodle broth was not good taste like water and a scoop of beef instant mix. beef for noodles taste like beef from can soup. roast duck was not like anything you can get chicago which taste really good. cool concept but missing FLAVOR ! also no condiments on table no salt peper or anything !!!"}
{"text":"Really great authentic Chinese. Total comfort food. Have Vegetarian # 1 and crispy tofu. More than enough for 2 people and less than $20 total. A great hole in the wall gem."}
{"text":"We ordered clams with black bean sauce, which was delicious!  4 stars on that!  Kids enjoyed the roast  duck as an appetizer.  The fun noodles was a tad to greasy for my taste.  Rice noodle soup with beef broth, simple but good.  We love Asian style noodles.  We'll be back to explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"As a Hong Konger, living in Madison and being able to feel like being back home is at Hong Kong station. The food is really authentic and I always have a feeling that it's my parents cooking despite I am miles away. In a small city like Madison where I can find such authentic gem is almost unbelievable. The food worths a 5 star. However, the service was terrible. The ill-mannered, irrespecutful server made all kind of excuse to ask us to share a table when we already sat and ordered. Whereas, after we left that table, they did not ask the another ethnic group of the same number of persons who came later than us to share a table. Thanks for being so racist against us. I tried to talk to this server, and she walked passed me and ignored me. We do not want to receive this kind of treatment, no matter how good the food is. And I will never go back to this restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"a great destination for honey bbq pork (char sui style), bbq roasted duck, and other comfort Chinese food.  the broth of their soups the day that I ate there was very watered down so i'm on team bbq for now. 

they sort of ixed nay on the service vay.  find a more efficient way of serving lunch - i could have easily chopped my own duck and served my own rice in a fraction of the time.  yes, i'm writing this review because i totally want you guys to stay in business.  either become an order at the counter self-service place or go all in with better table service. there is no middle ground here. 

dam that pork was hella good."}
{"text":"I had dinner there last night. I ordered a duck and rice noodle dish. It had such a good flavor. My sister had an egg noodle soup. She asked for mild and it was quite spicy but really good. Don't expect five star service but everything looked clean and you were able to pay with credit. I would recommend and I will go back. Oh and prices were pretty decent too."}
{"text":"Very traditional Chinese restaurant.  Probably the best Chinese food in Madison, however it may be intimidating ordering if you don't speak Chinese, try it out anyways!  The food is worth it!"}
{"text":"They seem to have a different waitress these days. I'm upgrading them to 3 stars. Noodle bowls are still cheap and yummy. We also ordered their spicy chicken wing which was also tasty. The service still seems spotty. Our spicy chicken wings came out after our noodle bowls, and after I reminded the waitress that we had ordered it. However, we didn't have to wait too long for our food this time, and it came out at the same time so we could actually dine together."}
{"text":"This would be good if they at least spoke more English enabling them to speak to there non speaking chinese customers. I went there with a friend hoping to get a meal together as a family size portion. I went there of course to see how every customers had there dishes like and pretty much its a lunch size portion and of course when i got mine, it was small and the workers there was staring at us and probably talking about too. So i think this will be my first and last time coming to this place. This place only for people whp speaks chinese more. Cause they only know very basic English. Other than that i rather go else where."}
{"text":"Yummy food- I recommend hanging duck and bbq pork- the crispy pork on appetizer menu is great- liver/kidney skewers were a little dry.  fav dish was this thing called tofu and eight treasures- comes in hot pot- super flavorful.  eggplant with minced pork is also good.  this is the only place i know of in Madison that has steamed chicken, duck, and bbq as meals.  surprisingly yummy. small space but lots of intl asian folks there so that's a good sign."}
{"text":"When we walked in last night, we were lucky to grab the last open table.  The setup is a little confusing for the first time diner.  We received 4 sheets of the menu-each sheet having different items for you to choose from (for instance, there is a sheet to build your own soup bowl).  Simply mark what you want and give it to the waiter/waitress when they return.  There is ALOT on the menu so choosing something can be a daunting task.  As many of the tables were filled with soup bowls, my girlfriend opted for that as I went with the Beef Chow Fun and a pork bun.  For the soup bowls, you have the choice over the type of noodle, the type of broth, and then what protein or other yummy thing you want added to it.  She opted for the pork bone broth as a base with udon noodles and beef.  The broth was absolutely excellent and was the perfect solution to a cold and rainy night.  The rest of the ingredients were solid but I feel the broth (as it should) stole the show.  With mine, I can freely admit that I am not a Beef Chow Fun expert but thought it was very good.  The beef was sliced thin and tender and while the noodles were oily, I was not surprised as they are stir fried.  I summed it up to my girlfriend as \"cantonese comfort food\".  The pork bun was ok as the pork filling inside (although tasty) was only lukewarm.
I liked the feel inside the restaurant.  It won't win any awards for decorating as the walls were covered with vintage and randoms pictures and posters.  It's small and can be cramped but I think that adds to it's charm.  I definitely will add this to my regular rotation of restaurants that I frequent."}
{"text":"seriously the worst customer service. We were struggling so much to order. They were having a family dinner in the middle of the restaurant and took our order from where they were sitting. Order to go if you can. the food was decent for its price though."}
{"text":"After 3 years of coming here, they're learning and evolving.

The menu has changed drastically and they've cut out many items that were not very tasty or that weren't ordered very much.
The menus they hand out now are little forms that you check off what you want, which I guess decreases wait time.

There are three options for noodle soups now, all of which are great! The mala noodles are incredibly spicy, even for a guy that lives on peppers, but it doesn't take away from the savory broth. Other than the noodles, the menu items can range from fantastic to boring. Clay pot meals are filling if you're willing to pick through a few bones. The rice bowl with meat and greens is simple but satisfying.

The service has picked up quite a bit since they've hired some new faces, but its also a reason I knock a star off their rating. At times, orders can come out incomplete or wrong. With servers that don't speak English fluently, it can be hard to tell them this. Also, the tiny space makes it hard to fit everyone and its considerably inconvenient to be asked to move to accommodate another party.

Despite these flaws, I still find myself coming here at least once a month to polish off a bowl of noodles. If you can, come eat here and experience noodles that don't have to be pho. Skip it if there's a crowd or just come back an hour later."}
{"text":"Hong Kong Station is 3 for 3 with me for lunch.  I can only comment on the soup and the bao, which are both great.  The \"spicy\" broth will get your lips stinging-- great stuff.  Tends to fill up at lunch during the week, communication can be a challenge, and if its cold outside its cold inside-- but all worth it!"}
{"text":"I can't give it 5 because the service was lacking and confusing for ordering. Unless your a regular they assume you are very America and will laugh if you ask questions. No silver to be found. 
The best place if you want duck or bbq pork. The salted crispy pork is another good one. 
Again the service is odd and quite frankly rude if you aren't a regular. But the food is worth it. Ps don't order the crab Rangoon unless you want to be laughed at."}
{"text":"This restaurant had been on my radar ever since I got back to Madison for the summer, and I'm so glad I got to try it before I left! It was definitely refreshing to see such an authentic Chinese restaurant pop up downtown, and I'm sad that I won't be around to see how the business continues to grow.

I ordered the BBQ pork (cha siu) rice bowl, which came with a side of boiled bok choy. It definitely satisfied a craving I'd had all summer for traditional Chinese cuisine!! Although the best part of the rice bowl was definitely the sauce that was drizzled over the BBQ pork and the rice, I enjoyed how everything went together.

They also have a variety of 'street food' style appetizer items, such as congee, BBQ pork/beef/chicken on a stick, and Chinese doughnut. 

Hong Kong Station is definitely one of the better Chinese restaurants in the area, although I do believe that they could use a few big improvements: 1) complimentary hot tea, which is pretty commonplace at any decent Chinese restaurant; 2) servers/hostesses who can speak better english - way too much got lost in translation when we were ordering our meal, I was almost afraid that our orders were going to come out all wrong - this was particularly important to me because we had one vegetarian dining companion; 3) ix-nay on the gaudy decor - I get that they are going for a 'hole-in-the-wall'/'dive-y' type of appeal, but it just made the place look cramped. With these changes, it is easy to see HK station becoming a Madison favorite! :)"}
{"text":"Extremely horrible owners. Service is rude and slow. Food is dirty and expensive. Taste is good but the quality is bad. Frustrated me several times due to these reasons."}
{"text":"Great food with good price. Have been there at least twice a month since their opening. For sure to visit more later."}
{"text":"Great little place for some authentic Cantonese & Chinese food. It gets pretty busy during lunch time but service is usually quick. Agree with other reviewers, the service can be bad sometimes, but it can be excused since they have such great dishes.. There're another place with the similar name on Regent St. also (Hong Kong cafe) , so don't get confused."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time with my Mom this afternoon. Did not expect it to be a fancy place but wanted some Hong Kong style cooking and the restaurant really delivered. We ordered lemongrass chicken wings for an appetizer. They were aromatic and flavorful. I had General Beef Noodle Soup with Rice Stick ?????. It was very delicious. The beef was tender and the broth had just the right amount of seasoning. We would definitely go again and recommend it to our friends."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Madison and compares favorably with my experiences with Chinese food (I am Chinese American). 

Before moving out to DC, I was a Hong Kong Station regular, going every Wednesday evening for about a year. The child I babysat for loved hanging out with the restaurant owner's children and we almost religiously got the same dishes each time. (Please look at photos of same dish on multiple occasions...I take pictures every time I eat). There is also a review on Instagram on food4wu account. 

The child would get the fresh roast bbq pork with rice and bbq pork buns (??) . The bbq pork with rice was not on the menu, but because she became a regular, the owners catered to her. 

I usually get the spicy mala soup with a spiced egg and a veggie like baby Bok Choy. I prefer spicy, not Super Spicy. I have gotten several friends hooked on this combination and we could easily eat it once a week 

I have tried other noodle dishes and enjoyed them as well. My significant other sometimes craves the shrimp nian gao (??). He also likes getting egg rolls.

The staff is admittedly slower and more disorganized than some might prefer, but over time you can build rapport and honestly the food can not be beat.

I plan to visit this restaurant during my visit back to Madison exclusively to fill my spicy soup craving! Definitely would recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food is definitely good and authentic. This is the only Asian restaurant in Madison that I know of that serves stir fry on choy vegetables, which is a must. I use to always have to drive to Chicago to get a plate, now I can get an order in Madison. The noodle dishes are good also, you get a decent amount of meat and vegetables. The service is a bit slow, however that is expected from a small Asian restaurant. Overall decent spot and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"They have their new sign up so don't say you can't find it.

Ask my Spousal Unit and she'll tell you that all Bob S. ever really wants to find is a noodle shop that serves big bowls of noodles with all sorts of goodies on them. I'm still working my way through their several noodle types and additions, searching for that transcendental bowl of noodle-ness. 

I ordered a spicy broth, egg noodle, baby bok-choy with beef. The broth wasn't very spicy but there are 'Scoville' additives available on the table for cranking up the heat. A tasty bowl but, I'll keep working it. Service is variable, language confusion happens but, hey, it's a new place, I'll give them some time to work out the kinks. In the meantime, find me slurping noodles at HKS."}
