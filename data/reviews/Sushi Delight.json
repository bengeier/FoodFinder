{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite Japanese restaurants in Toronto. Nothing beats their price and their quality of food. Not only do they have amazing food, but their customer service is top notch. Most definitely coming back here with my family again! Especially love the amazing deals that they offer! definitely worth the price! Especially their winter special, they never fail to amaze me with their quality of food and service!"}
{"text":"There isn't really anything special about this place. I thought the sushi was decent, and very reasonably priced. Service was fantastic, which rates it a 4 in my books."}
{"text":"This restaurant was just okay. Everything about it was okay. The service was okay, the decor was okay, the food was okay. Not really a memorable experience. I don't think I will be going back. There are just so many other choices that are better for the price. 

I got the Osaka bento box for $13 I believe. I came with rice, 6 sushi rolls, spring rolls, assorted tempura, salad, miso soup and Teriyaki Chicken. Also after my meal I got a choice between Green Tea or Mango ice cream. This is the first restaurant that stated on the menu that they give ice cream with the bento box BUT I had to ask for it because I even forgot about it when I was getting ready to leave. If they remembered to give me it then this would've got a 3 star.

In conclusion this restaurant is just okay but I would suggest to go somewhere else if you want an above average experience."}
{"text":"DON'T GET THE SHOYU RAMEN !

Soup base was very bland, toppings were cold (especially the Shoyu pork). Eggs were HARD boiled when I say hard I mean it; they were very cold and cooked way too long. I guess Ramen isn't their specialty seeing as this is a sushi joint, but gosh- if you're gonna sell it make sure it's at least half decent."}
{"text":"Although I have been going to this place for almost 8 years, I don't think I can go back to Sushi Delight. 

The last time I was there I found clear, hard plastic in my avocado roll. Hoping it was a one-time thing, I had lunch there today and it was awful. I ordered two rolls with soup and when our server brought our bowls over, we noticed that she had open, bleeding sores on the backs and insides of both her hands. She did not have any bandages or gloves on. We couldn't touch our food. While deciding if we should talk to the manager or just leave asap, our rolls arrived and my vegetarian sushi had fish eggs all over it and the avocado was well beyond just brown, it was rotten. 

Never going there again."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch from here via Uber Eats and when it arrived - all avocado included in the sushi was brown. Ate a bit but stopped as the idea of why it is brown and whether it may make me sick set in. Now still very much worried about the latter issue! Mad at myself for not just throwing it out immediately - mad at the restaurant for sending out food that bad. The order came pretty quickly so I don't think it was an issue of it sitting around or Uber Eats taking too long to deliver or anything like that. If it was sitting around too long anywhere - it would have been in the restaurant. Fingers crossed I don't get sick! Quite annoyed at having spent money on a lunch too suspect to eat. Really, really hoping I don't get food poisoning."}
{"text":"It is with a sad heart that I write this review.  My husband and I have been going to this restaurant for over 10 years.  It was actually the place I tried sushi for the first time.  It's always been reasonably priced with great food.  Always delicious and consistent.  

We went at the end of December (we hadn't been in a while-out of the way for us now) but we were unpleasantly surprised about how downhill things had gone.   These were the problems we had:

1-We ordered gyoza...they never came.

2-We had the fried calamari.  In the past it came with a sweet sauce.  I asked our waitress about it and she looked at me like I was stupid.   Her answer was \"It never came with sauce.  There's lemon.\"

3-My husband's sushi and sashimi meal came out 15 min before my single roll.  

4-It was freezing in the restaurant!   Every single patron kept their winter jacket on.

5-The waitress was flinging dishes on the table instead of placing them down.   It's the first time I've ever seen a waitress behave that way.   The only consolation was she was treating everyone that way-lol.

Sadly we won't be back even though we had been patrons for a very long time.   With the competition on the danforth they need to get things back on track!"}
{"text":"This place has been on a downward spiral for 5 years now. When I first discovered this place I was in love. That was because I was a naive sushi newbie and the restaurant was upholding higher standards back then. Over time, and with a change in ownership, the quality of this sushi has gone extremely downhill. The sashimi is often still frozen and thawing on your plate (gross), the fish is not cut well and often still joined together instead of in separate pieces, rolls have way too much rice, are loosely wrapped and have terrible cuts of fish and too much 'filler' (cucumber, avocado). 
Overall, if you are just learning about sushi, give it a shot but if you're accustomed to your better sushi places, it's sure to disappoint.
Now, let's talk service...or shall I say lack of service. The issue here is largely one of language. Most of their servers barely speak English so if you have a question or request-good luck!
I will say that the decor is quite nice, especially given their makeover a couple of years ago.
Given that I live in this neighborhood, I am very disappointed as a great sushi resto would be amazing to have alongside the Greek places but 'Sushi D' (as it's known to locals) just doesn't meet basic expectations anymore. :("}
{"text":"Although it doesn't have the large variety of veggie sushi that sushi on bloor does, it's equally tasty. The sushi is well made and the ingredients are fresh, even the avocado. 

The service is prompt and it's a good option for a quick sit down lunch. This is my second time in a week and I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I hate to write bad reviews but I ordered some stuff for delivery. The sushi rolls weren't properly rolled up and it wasn't what I expected. Probably worst sushi I have ever had. Anyway. I walked all the way in the rain with my gf to return it. They didn't seem keen on the return and they remade the order. It looked the same and honestly I didn't want sushi anymore. I wish they asked what I wanted in the first place. I left the food there since they refused a refund. Horrible food. Horrible service."}
{"text":"OMG worst sushi ever.  Do not eat here even if its the last restaurant on earth.  The fish was slimy and unedible, the food was clearly old and warmed up.  Incredibly bad.  Do not waste your money."}
{"text":"Great food for a good price. Good service. My favorite sushi restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"We frequent Sushi Delight at least once a week. However its really only my son who's keen on going. Lately the food he orders anything w/ salmon has been swimming in too much teriyaki sauce. He rarely finishes his food havin to complain that the teriyaki sauce is over powering the taste of salmon. He's only 7 and he knows how he wants his salmon done! We complained but its the same thing whenever we go. 

Another thing is that Im glad they clean up well however it bothers our party that as soon as we have our last spoon of food off our plate they take it right away!  We told them not to do it but they do anyways

Food quality are great for the fried dishes but we dont eat sushi there, so cant complain."}
{"text":"Too many health infractions for a sushi restaurant:
http://www.toronto.ca/health/dinesafe/index.htm?show=detail&id=96974

I like their sushi and the restaurant, but this is quite a long list of serious inspection problems on DineSafe."}
{"text":"My family and I waited almost 40 minutes for our food and we had no substitutions. 
We got a to go order and we informed that one of us has a shellfish allergy and to please package what we ordered separately and we ordered so that it would be easy for them to do that. They didn't, part of the veggie box was packaged with the special dragon roll, which contained tempura shrimp.
Portions were small, a lot smaller than I've had at many different places. Tempura on the veggies was soggy. Miso soup was excellent however.
Price was decent, but if you go out to the Annex area of Bloor St. you can get much better food at the same or better prices.
They have a little sidewalk patio at Sushi Delight, but it is so crowded that it is difficult to get in or out.

I would be hard pressed to go back here again."}
{"text":"Love it. Cheap and cheerful, always busy.
I'm no sushi snob, but I like what they have - bento, tempura, green tea icecream! The kids are always welcome and appreciative"}
{"text":"In my humble opinion, this is my favourite restaurant in the city and I love Sushi.
The service is excellent and the food is outstanding and reasonably priced. 
The fire dragon rolls melt in your mouth ! 
This place is reasonably priced compared to miku and Ki"}
{"text":"I am truly baffled by the 4+ star ratings on here. This place has NEVER been anything more than mediocre at best, and I've given it many, many tries because apparently I'm an idiot (and I live in the neighb.). Oh and there's no excuse for brown avocado from a restaurant."}
{"text":"I consider myself a sushi snob. But for cheap, fast service and decent- not extravagant nigiri or sashimi this place cuts it pretty good."}
{"text":"I had a veggie bentobox there last night. It was a good combo for dinner but the quality was not matched with my expectation. Price was ok, not cheap nor expensive. the services was ok too, but the parking is a problem for this place"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for sushi in East York. You get the best bang for your buck here. The sushi rolls are a good size and very reasonably priced. The service is quick and prompt. Sometimes they will offer a free small appetizer which is great! I will always continue to come back to Sushi Delight."}
{"text":"Perfectly priced for the quality of sushi.  And perfect to bring the kids; I saw a lot of families there when we ate.  And I brought my kid.  My son's Japanese food experience is usually rice, soup, chicken teriyaki, ice cream.  We ordered the Kyoto Bento box which had all of that and he discovered broccoli tempura!  Perfect for him, and I ate the sushi he didn't like.

I particularly love sushi and sashimi combinations.  And that's what I had.  Enjoyable all around - and now I will feel comfortable about ordering take out too."}
{"text":"I am so glad we came here! My friend and I wanted some sushi (yes, while in Greek town... what can I say - the heart wants what the heart wants) before our concert at the Danforth Music Hall. This was close enough, and we were looking for something simple and reasonably cheap.

This place hit the nail on the head. The fish tasted fresh, delicious and not \"fishy\". Our replacements in the sashimi/sushi combos were arranged easily. The service was excellent (the waiter brought 2 salads and edamame and miso soup when I ordered 2 teas and wine - he confirmed that we will be on a timeline to get to our show. Very nice!)

The meal we had was simple - sushi-sashmi meal, and half a litre of white (nice thing - 2 glasses of white cost as much as 1/2 a litre - so nice place for 2 girlfriends to catch up in!)

Are there fancier sushi places? Without a doubt. But if you want a cheap, clean, nice, easy sushi place with good solid basics this is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Recently redecorated from top to bottom, Sushi Delight is a Danforth denizen favourite.  Reasonably-priced lunch and dinner specials can mean a bit of a wait for a table sometimes, but the quality and value are definitely worth it.  Best bet: one of the many Bento boxes on offer.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about 8 years.  Tonight was the worst.   They continue to serve the appetizers in the middle the meal.  they bring the rice at the beginning so it's cold by the time the main course comes.  The WORST!!  The salmon sashimi was dry and dark... Their wasabi had a bitter taste to it like it wasn't real wasabi. The miso soup tastes like it was watered down.  It's been getting worse the last couple of years.  Next step... No coming here anymore."}
{"text":"Listen to the 3 stars review. Because that is all this place can offer you. Ordered the bento with short ribs, shrimp/veggies tempuras, sashimi and california rolls for 14$. Got miso soup but no edamame. :( It was filling but the taste? Nothing special. Everything was on the bland side. Place was spacious enough."}
{"text":"I don't know why everyone seems to be hating on Sushi Delight.  I've been here a few times over the past year, and have never had a bad experience.  In fact, I think this place has surpassed Katsu as my fave Danforth sushi spot!

I went last night with a friend from Vancouver and our meal was excellent.  Before we ordered we were given complimentary edamame and miso soup.  It took us a while to decide what we wanted, because the menu is huge.  But that's one of the reasons I like this place so much --  really  great selection.  The menu is also beautifully designed and printed (the photos make the food look just as delicious as it tastes). 

We ended up going with the spicy maki set, and a sashimi platter.  This came with complimentary green salads, and I'd like to take a moment to note how fantastic the dressing is...some restaurants serve it with what tastes like a bad version of French dressing, but the dressing here is peanuty goodness. The maki were huge, and not too saucy .  I'm always a little nervous ordering sashimi, but the fish here tasted very fresh and melt-in-your-mouth.  

If you're on a budget and want great sushi I highly recommend Sushi Delight.  Dinner for two, including drinks, was $42."}
{"text":"We went for dinner, a group of 4 adults and 1 baby. The service was phenomenal, the staff were very attentive, making sure our water glasses were full and that we had everything we needed. Also, they were very kid friendly! The food came out fast and was delicious all around, sushi was very fresh. All in all a great experience and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great cheap sushi place!

Its one of the cheaper ones around and also one of the best which is pretty rare.

They are very friendly and rolls are good, once star less because they could be a bit bigger but its not like youre paying very much so you can always order an extra maki

The menu has really great specials, Last time I got a dinner for 2 (for myself) it came with a chicken teryaki bowl, shrimp bowl, dumplings, soup, salad and maki for only 14.00 

Also, their maki rolls are always a good choice

The inside is very nice and quiet especially late afternoon, and the washrooms are clean"}
{"text":"Wow, I'm surprised by the number of poor reviews this place has received.  I've been here about 10 times, and I've never had anything but a great meal.  The tempura is great. Shrimp are large and the batter  is crisp and not greasy. The grilled beef is outstanding.  Sushi is fresh.  For less than $15, I get a meal that I can barely finish (and I can eat you under the table).  

The room is a bit tight for space and the neighbourhood is busy so there's a lot of traffic, but other than that, I have no complaints.  I've been going to a number of other Japanese places lately, and the more I dine elsewhere, the more I appreciate this crowded little place.

Last time I visited, they gave us a basket of calamari on the house.  When my daughter visited recently, they gave her free edamame.  Nice folks."}
{"text":"I really like Sushi Delight for a number of reasons. First off, I've never really had any specialty rolls at this place, so my review is mainly for the bento box eaters out there.

Customer service is a plus here. Although many people can't speak English that well, there's always one guy who can and he's the most inviting individual ever. I think he might be the manager of the joint, and he does a pretty good job at running the place.

I usually get the Tokyo Box which is no more than $12 for a lot of food that I often can't finish by myself (and trust me, I can eat A LOT). You get: 
-3 salmon sushi pieces, 3 cucumber roll pieces, and 3 pieces of assorted sushi (I usually ask to substitute the 3 salmon and 3 cucumber for 6 california roll pieces and this is never and issue).
-miso soup and salad
-shrimp and veggie tempura
-and your choice of chicken teriyaki, salmon, or strip steak (I usually get the chicken which is great, but they could go a little easy on the teriyaki sauce).

So, as you can see that's a lot of food and you also get your choice of ice cream at the end of all of this. The sushi isn't bad, but it's also not the focal point of my meal, so I can't really judge, but the box is always on point.

I recommend you come here if you really want to fill up on some Japanese food for a great price. Come here enough and the manager will start giving you apps on the house (he's a great guy)."}
{"text":"I went in for lunch, although I was in Greek town an the obvious choice should have been gyros I opted for the sushi. 

I had a friendly server who seemed eager to serve me. He also suggested a few items on their menu but I sticked to my usual full of fish rolls.

The prices were good, but the fish well it was fishy and not at all fresh. It had started to form a crust. Because of my past food poisoning experience I decided not to risk it. 
They gave me a 15% off my next visit but I don't thunk I'll be returning."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed the food and the service each time that I've gone to Sushi Delight and will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"i went with my daughter to try out the food as we were considering them for a party coming up.

the food was okay, the service good. i pay cash and while i didn't expect it they said there was 10% off.

it wasn't until i got home and looked at the bill that i realize i was ripped off. was it a glitch? was it intentional? given it appears a computerized means of billing i would think it a rip off built in for the unwary.

good lesson to scrutinize the bills more closely and i think we'll try a couple of other places for the party."}
{"text":"This place is my family's go-to restaurant for a good, filling meal at a very reasonable price. I've been coming to Sushi Delight for most of my childhood and all of my adult life; every time I've come, I always leave satisfied. And since I've been coming for so many years, our table is regularly given complimentary appetizers! Now, the food isn't amazing; it is exactly what you would imagine a Chinese run Japanese restaurant on the Danforth would be like. However, it is hard to beat a good deal ($14 for a bento with salad, soup, 6 rolls, 3 pieces of salmon sashimi, rice, meat, tempura, dessert!!!!!!!)! Never have I left this place without a serious case of a food coma. 

Tdlr; good (not amazing) food at a price that won't make your wallet weep."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! 

The sashimi and edamame were not fresh at all. The fried chicken udon and appetizer trey A were just ok.

I just throw the sashimi and edamame into the garbage bin!

Definately will not order a delivery again!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the worst sushi restaurant that I have ever eaten. Even an one-star rating is a compliment to this restaurant and is undeserving of anything else.

First impression of the Miso soup, was that it was great, but nothing special since it was pretty much the same everywhere else. The nice seed weed leaves in the soup were large and the broth was nice and fishy, the tofu pieces where edible and had the same velvety texture. Taste good and hot.

There were signs of problems when I started on the salad. The usual cool lettuce that I was expecting was replace by room temperature and browning pieces of lettuce - BIG WARNING SIGN. Secondly the usual dressing that comes with the salad came with peanut sauce in it. WTF -  leave it the way it is, don't try to go noveau style on people. Sushi Delight is the only Sushi restaurant that does this. Didn't taste good as the usual style of dressing that goes on salad - you know the tangy tasting salad dressing everyone gets.

Will not go back until they start to smarten up on how they prepare their sushi. Horrible preparation, looks like they use 3rd rate sushi chef to prepare the Chirashi that I ordered. The sashimi pieces were large which was great, until you see how they were cut - uneven and not very appetizing at all. 

If you want a comparison, go to other Sushi restaurants in Toronto such as Sushi Time, Generation Sushi or Sakura Ichiban, then order the same Charashi at Sushi Delight. Huge difference in terms of freshness, taste and presentation. 

I have been eating Sushi since 1996 and have gone to countless Sushi restaurant. DO NOT GO to this restaurant. You've been warned. The only thing that I see appealing about this place is the Decor - very modern, in-style and attractive. Do not be fooled, the food is horrible."}
{"text":"I order from Sushi Delight practically once a week and it is absolutely delightful! 

We get take out but they are always super fast - even though they say 45 minutes. Far and away the best thing they make is sushi pizza - deep fried rice cake with spring onions, a spicy mayo dressing, smoked salmon and roe. It is bursting with sweet and savoury flavours. I know it sounds weird but it is so insanely good. 

Their sushi is also really good - we get spicy tuna and rainbow rolls and they are scrumptious. For the price and quality of the food, Sushi Delight is a solid bet."}
{"text":"Cheap sushi for sure but you get what you pay for. Fish wasn't fresh and portions were small. Plus side was that they delivered in like 20 mins!"}
{"text":"The sushis and makis are good and they have a large choice on the menu. They also have sushi burrito and hot Japanese diners.  
The price is ok but the delivery is really long (45mn to 1h). 
Good to have some sushis at home!"}
{"text":"This is totally a 3 star place.  It's ok, the service is ok, the sushi is just ok.  We dined in, but were unfortunately unable to enjoy our meal because the table next to us/behind me had a lady who was a really loud talker.  I heard her conversation better than ours.  I don't know that I want to frequent a place with such inconsiderate diners.

Certainly made the food way less memorable.  I didn't get sick, so I guess it was fine.

I'm probably not coming back...or at least not often.  Too many good places to eat to have it ruined by others."}
{"text":"Sushi delight is a mediocre Japanese restaurant. You basically get for what you pay. The service is pretty good. I've been going here with my family on a constant basis. The ingredients are usually a hit or miss depending on whether you go on a busy day or not. If you are going here for their lunch specials then for sure its worth it. Their lunch bento boxes are less than $10. I don't think there are many other places where you can get such a cheap deal."}
{"text":"I have a massive grudge against this place.

It's sort of a popular place around here, why, I don't know. The sushi is alright but comparing this place to other sushi places I have been I can honestly say this is one of the worse ones. The sushi is painfully average and unremarkable and the cooked food is not very good either. 

I got the spinach here and blechh its the worst spinach I have ever had. A pathetic pile of cold steamed spinach with tasteless fish flakes. This would make any half decent Cajun cook throw himself to the gators with disappointment. Most of the waiters here suck too.

it's kind of a disgrace how many people think that this is the best place for food on the danforth. Why on earth would you come here instead of one of the billion better places on the danforth, there are better sushi places too so there is no excuse.

The only sympathy I have for the place is that one time a delivery guy got his sushi robbed by some local crackheads.

Why the hell is it so popular? This is the duke of york of Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi place! They give you A LOT of food. I Got the Kyoto Box for 9.50, they brought us all miso & edemame to nibble on while we wait. They allowed me to change my deep fried veggies for steamed, no problemo. The rolls were yummy, service was fast and they staff were friendly. I had lots of left  overs :)"}
{"text":"Sushi Delight seems very out of place on the Danforth, wedged in between all the greek restaurants that line both sides of the street. However, there seems to be quite a few sushi restaurants so maybe this is a new trend for the area. I got the chef's special temp don big bowl, which was 5 sizable katsu-breaded shrimp and 4 katsu-breaded sweet potato on a large bowl of rice with some pickled radishes. It was a big portion for the price ($9 all in), but nothing special that would bring a new experience to japanese cuisine. 

The service was very polite and prompt for a Sunday night late dinner. They were courteous and checked in on us to make sure we had enough tea and the like. The bill took a little longer to get, but we weren't in a rush so wasn't really bothered. I appreciated the extra effort they made with the edamame appetizer and the chef's treat of a salmon tartare pizza."}
{"text":"Good, cheap sushi.

The party trays in particular are a good deal!"}
{"text":"Lunch special bento box!! Sushi delight has daily lunch special from 11:30am-4pm.  This is my favourite place to get a bento box for lunch.  I've been going here for more than eight years (of course, they've raised the price over the years but still worth it!).  I got Combo A with chicken teriyaki for $7.50.  Comes with miso soup, salad, chicken teriyaki, vegetable tempuras, sushi, springroll and fruits. It usually comes with two cucumber and two California pieces, but I switched to all four California pieces with no extra cost.  Nice atmosphere. Staff was very friendly and attentive.  Food was quick and delicious.  Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Very good deal on the lunch specials. Unfortunately the sashimi is not fresh. It's fishy and every time I eat it, I feel a little sick after. Everything else is pretty good though."}
{"text":"Meal for 4?! I say Meal for 6! What a deal!

FOOD
We had the family deal and holy moly was there a lot of food! We could have fed an army! ok maybe not an army but more like a basketball team with a sub.

The food was good too! I have no complaint.

PRICE
Very reasonable. I think it was a family deal of $45? or was it $55? Whatever it was, i just remember how reasonable it was priced.

SEATING
The area was very small and they sat us next to the door. It was freezing every time someone went in and out so that wasn't very pleasant."}
{"text":"What better way to spend a summer day then to have lunch with coworkers from your former place of employment? I had lunch here today with some former colleagues as we are no longer teaching at the same school. One of the said FC's lives down the street from Sushi Delight and frequents this place at least two x/week. 

We all ordered a variation of sushi rolls and bento boxes. 

Sushi Delight is basically your run of the mill restaurant that serves Japanese food. The plus side is that the food is cheap. It would be a pity to spend oodles of dollars on something mediocre. For under $10, you get enough food to cover you for both lunch and dinner. I ordered the chicken terriyaki roll ... a maki roll passed on from one samurai generation to another (okay, maybe not). On top of the roll, terriyaki sauce was poured on. Terriyaki sauce is my biggest vice so I was not complaining.

The service was very good, I must say. We were seated quickly and the server was very patient in spite of the indecisiveness of some of my former colleagues. Each one of us recieved a VIP card, which gives us discounts for the next time that we eat at Sushi Delight.

Parking is close to impossible to find, especially on a warm, nice day. After looking for 15 minutes, I managed to squeeze into a spot on the street (thank God for the reverse mirror on my SUV). If you take the TTC, however, Sushi Delight is conveniently located.

I wont make an effort to come back, but if I'm on the Danforth and I don't want Greek food, I might choose Sushi Delight. If you live in the area and you want sushi, SD is probably the most convenient location for you."}
{"text":"This placed used to be acceptable, unfortunately, it hasn't bounced back to its \"glory\" days (if you can call it that)."}
{"text":"I came downtown to pick up something. It was 4pm, kids were a bit hungry.  We knew we had to get back to Markham, but with driving through traffic etc.. we decided to have an early dinner.  I really didn't feel like having japanese... really didn't have a craving for it.

Entering the restaurant, it was surprisingly busy!! Who the heck eats at 4pm... got a bench seat, and started looking at the menu.  lunch specials end at 4pm!!  Haha, everyone here is rushing to get in on the lunch special, because by 4:30, the place was clear. Only one other table was occupied.

So, browsing the menu.. i usually get the Sushi Osaka. I ordered that, even though i didn't have the craving for it.

Surprisingly it turned out really good!!  Tasty, rice on sushi was nice. Everything was good!! the Spicy salmon roll was good!
Then the service, was fantastic.  Not once did i have to ask for water refill, they came 3 times with out me asking.

I was thinking to myself that they must of seen me taking pictures, and recognized me and stepped up the service!!

Basically it was a perfect experience!! Especially since i didn't have a craving for sushi. Usually if you don't have a  craving for something, it ends up bland tasting, or not enjoyable.

4.5 - 5 stars for this early dinner experience (pretty empty restaurant)"}
{"text":"it is decent danforth sushi...
very fast service, and comfortable setting for dinner.

had the edamame, and a small sushi boat that was well presented...was a boat in the picture on the menu, but came out on this neat fish plate.

the VIP card is a good idea, get on it!"}
{"text":"I went in by myself around 3:30pm.


The good:  lunch specials run till 4:00pm.  Portion sizes are big for their lunch specials.  

The bad: I did a lot of waiting.  I waited long to even receive a menu.  Waited long to have my order taken.  I almost got up and left.  
I ordered one of their lunch specials and an appetizer(soft shelled crab).  I received my maki rolls and finished them with no sign of the appetizer. I finally saw the waitress and requested IF the appetizer was made, to make it to go, and I needed the bill.  After a short wait, I find out the app was never made and asked if i wanted to cancel the order.  Of course I cancelled.  
Lastly, when i walked in, I was told I to take any table.  As I walked to my table, I saw a woman with her head down on another table and she looked like she was sleeping.  I later find out this was the waitress.  It looked unappealing enough to let a customer sleep on a table, but it was unprofessional for staff to be doing that.

Overall,  there are MANY food options on the danforth.  I would rather try a new place then go back here."}
{"text":"#Garbage. 
Ordered a sushi platter at 7 pm on a Friday...waiting. Waiting. Still waiting. 

After 1.5 hours and 3 attempts to call them to find out the status of my order, they offered 15% off my next order. The person speaking on the phone hung up on me. 

Wow. Really?

When the sushi platter finally arrived, I gave it right back.  

Unacceptable. 

My guests are hungry and this is an embarrassment. It's not like one has to cook the food and deliver it hot. 

Save your money. Call some place else for fresh reliable sushi.
 
Never ever going to give them my money again. 

You decide."}
{"text":"VIBE 
The last place you'd think there would be a sushi joint is on The Danforth, otherwise known as Greektown. But there is. And I like it. It's pretty dark inside but as soon as you walk in, the chefs behind the counter wave you hello (even if they pretend they don't know how to speak English).  Décor is dark mahogany and white, a sophisticated palatte for a casual sushi restaurant. That said, it works.

I ATE/EAT 
A note: green tea, edamame and miso soup (and sometimes ice cream) are complimentary. Other restaurants usually make you pay for some of these items, so you're already getting tremendous value. I come here on the regular and my go-tos are the maki rolls. The rainbow roll (dynamite roll topped with salmon)is my favourite. The dynamite roll and spicy tuna are good value (though not the best I've had). All I have to say, however is that it's CHEAP (in a good way).  For lunch I had green tea, edamame, miso soup and spicy tuna maki. The waiter gave me a 15% discount so in total I paid $4.56 for lunch! That's less than a Starbucks tall chai latte! Another note: you can ask or get the VIP card. The waiters should be nice about it and it gets you on average 15% off your meal.  Another craving I used to have here was their sushi pizza. If you're looking for something greasy and healthy at the same time, their fried pizza topped with salmon is the ultimate hypocritical meal. And if you're nice sometimes they give you free ice cream (either green tea or red bean). Delish! 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
An excuse to head to the east (end) for a \"delightful\" meal. Anyone looking for a copywriter? *Wink."}
{"text":"We came here on a weekday during lunch rush, so we didn't have much time.  The place wasn't too busy when we got there. We were seated almost immediately. 

One of the servers took our order after a small wait and we waited for our food. 10 min pass before we get our salad and miso soup. 20 minutes later, the waitress comes back and tells me she has lost the piece of scrap paper she wrote out order on. At that point, I had to get back to work and we left really furious and disappointed. We ended up going drive-thru at McD.

* If you lost our order, let us know right away don't wait 20 minutes.  Orders shouldn't be written on a scrap piece of paper that looks like garbage (She had to un-crumple it for her to write on it...)

* If you lose our order and it took you that long to follow up an you find out your customers can no longer eat, don't make them pay for the pop - the only thing they managed to deliver.  Service here is by far the worst we've ever had.

For me, service is a BIGGIE and this place didn't give it. Thumbs down and 1 star (if I could give a 0 star, i would have.)"}
{"text":"Sushi \"Delight\" my ass. Worst experience here. Service is BAD, and sushi isn't great. I was seated at around 3:55, and were given the lunch menu... or special whatever it was. So we were assuming it would be okay to order from it but the waitress was like, yeah no it's 4:05 you can't. Why would you even bring that menu out if customers aren't even able to order from it? We didn't mind ordering from the regular menu anyways, so we did. There was literally like 2 tables of 3, or 4 seated at the time my party being one of the two (3). We waited about 50 minutes for our food... are you serious...... i swear it's the longest i've waited at any restaurant PERIOD. i could hardly finish my eel w/ rice, because it was gross. I don't think i'd ever come back."}
{"text":"Fast service and very tasty. I love sushi delight definitely will return for more sushi"}
