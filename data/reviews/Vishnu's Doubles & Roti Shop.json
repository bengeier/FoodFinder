{"text":"Awesome roti! The mini option of roti is perfect for me, not too much. Doubles were okay. Would definitely come back if in the area"}
{"text":"We were looking for a Caribbean place in Brampton and found this place close to home.  Tried a Caribbean style chicken roti after sometime."}
{"text":"The doubles here are awesome and the owners are always very friendly and quick. If you don't know what doubles are then it's like a wrap made from puri (it's like a deep fried version of roti) and chana masala (chickpeas in a spice mixture). I usually just get take away from here but there are tables and parking. I've tried a couple other things on the menu and it's all pretty good but I'd rather just get double the amount of doubles. The heart wants what it wants. The nice thing is that the spice mixture is added separately to the chickpeas so you can go with all your friends regardless of how much spice each person likes."}
{"text":"Great clean place. Food tastes like home. I would go back again for sure. Doubles are great, just would have liked to taste more of the mango chutney I ordered. Roti a bit dry. Owner very nice. Map is wrong it is on Kennedy but it's just north of Bovaird."}
{"text":"Stopped here several times for lunch at work.  Have ever only had the roti, but every time it has been delicious.  Pretty big serving too (I really could share it with someone, but often stuff down the whole tasty thing).  Nice selection of Solo brand sodas too.  Definitely worth a stop and one of the better rotis I've had in Brampton."}
{"text":"Just came back from there first time trying it i have to say the food was good had doubles and a chicken roti compared to the other places i haved tried this place is worth going back."}
{"text":"Best doubles around. It's like a taste of home. I've tried so many different roti shops around the GTA. I usually get doubles from Drupati's because it is close to my apartment but anytime I'm in Brampton, I need to get Vishnu's doubles.  The pepper is hot and spicy. I love washing down a good doubles with an AppleJ or Solo drink. Makes me feel like I'm at Piarco airport eating ah doubles.  Such a great Trini restaurant and the people who work there are so warm and friendly. Thank you Vishnu's Doubles and Roti Shop for existing!!! I love you!"}
{"text":"Ok doubles but slow service and very limited menu for a roti shop in Brampton.  The place lacks a warm inviting feeling and staff was to busy on the phone to acknowledge customers waiting."}
{"text":"Great Trinidadian place to grab some Roti and Doubles.  I suggest if you don't like too much spice in your doubles then get the pepper on the side!!  The doubles are mouth watering and so good though!  Also the duck roti was awesome but nothing can top the goat, ya know!  The price is very good and the shop has a homely feel to it with some nice Trini music playing in the background as you eat.  Would suggest this place fo sure, go check it out!"}
{"text":"Probably the best doubles and roti I've gotten from Brampton so far.  Tried Brampton Roti Shop prior to this and was pretty underwhelmed.  Vishnu's I'd consider a \"dry\" style compared to Brampton Roti Shop which was pretty wet (lots of gravy).  Boneless chicken roti and doubles were both delicious and included a homemade pepper sauce, but I shouldn't have asked for \"Medium Hot\" because it was a little too much for this white guy LOL.  Loved those doubles though."}
{"text":"They have the best doubles in Brampton in my opinion. I always order the boneless chicken doubles and order tons to keep in fridge and eat later."}
{"text":"Definitely need a fork/knife to eat a roti from here!  As boneless goat was saucy and medium came with nice spices.  Absolutely no scrimping on the meat!  Roti shell was dalpuri, but not dry.  Meal itself was more about meat+sauce, nice portion at $7.99.  We also ordered Chana Roti and a Double, and apparently both were great!  I'm not familiar with Brampton, but Vishnu's is located in a small, \"Tafmar\" plaza on a quiet strip of Kennedy.  So I hope this small business get a bit of traffic!  I'd definitely visit again if I was in the area.  The place itself was clean, a small counter where you place your order, and there were 3 tables, so probably better for take-out!  Question:  Aside from saving $1, why in the world would anyone order a BONE-IN roti???"}
{"text":"What a waste of money I literally counted 3 small pieces of goat in the entire roti.. Compared to other west Indian restaurants this is sub par wouldn't recommend it"}
