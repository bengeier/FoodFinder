{"text":"Broad selection of good beer and decent pub food. The patio is excellent. It's a great place to sit outside and enjoy a nice summer afternoon."}
{"text":"Nous avons pris le burger. Tres sec, pas de sauce, trop cuit. Donc trop cher pour la qualite (17$). Menu tres simple, choix sans originalite. Service correct sans plus. Les bieres sont bonnes, quoique 4 des bieres qu'on voulait n'etaient pas disponibles."}
{"text":"Nous étions un groupe de 10 personnes et nous avons voulu coller 2 tables ensemble pour êtres assis tous ensemble sur la terrasse ( qui était loin d'être remplie) Nous avons eu droit a une petite crisette du gérant qui a été extrêmement désagréable avec nous : apparemment il est interdit de bouger des tables sur la terrasse car le sol pourrait s'abîmer. Et ce , même si nous étions 10 personnes qui allions consommer pour au moins quelques centaines de dollars ...  Je n'y retournerai pas a cause du gérant"}
{"text":"My second time here. Both times have been during the winter :( + I am not a beer person. The ambiance is cool, good music but the food has been so so. 1st time I had the cheese burger and I asked AND paid for extra cheese but could not even taste it. This time I took the grilled cheese and ham. (as you can see I  cheese) I had to take out some ham because it was too much and other then that......personally I think I can make a better grilled cheese at home. I think I will try one more try and if not....it will just be off my list of \"go to's\". My date did enjoy his beers very much. So if you are looking for a place with good music and different beers, come try over here."}
{"text":"Qualité \"standard\" acceptable, mais le prix est trop élevé pour ce que c'est. Joli cadre et terrasse sympathique."}
{"text":"What a sham! We had been there many times with kids, and Suddenly they no longer accept you with kids (5years old) in none of the 2 inside areas. We were told we can stay on the terrase , on a 16 degrees rainy day! No thanks"}
{"text":"très belle place pour aller avec des proches. bonne bière, la meilleur bavette en ville!"}
{"text":"Well the staff was very nice at first, they helped us with our strollers and got the kids the seats they needed.  The waiter was ok, but a little slow.  The food in my opinion was the best I had sandwich wise in Montreal.  This place kicked butt!! Its a pub dont get me wrong, but the bread on our sandwiches were so tasty and done just \"Perfect\" it made the roast beef sandwich stand out!! My salad was good, and the whole experience was pleasent since everybody liked what they ate.  Ex: Buffalo wings, nachos, chicken sandwich, etc.....We were a group of 10. This will be the first place I come back too when in Montreal."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere- lots of space and beautiful terrasse. I don't know that much about beer so I rely on the profiles in the menu and got exactly what I was promised- the APA was delicious. Had a nice and hearty french onion soup which I recommend. However the tuna tartare was bland and even extra salt and lemon couldn't get me to finish my plate. My friends also gave up on their salmon tartares. Everything else my friends ordered seemed delicious though (fries calamari, mussels, burger etc)"}
{"text":"Oddly situated in an industrial - feeling area with asphalt parking lots and chain-link fence, this is nonetheless a charming little brewpub and a place you can get a bite to eat. I stayed and had a number of the beers, some decent and overall I'm impressed with this place. Worth wandering a little bit out-of-the-way for something different."}
{"text":"Je connaissais depuis un bon bout les bières de chez Brasseur de Montréal et j'avais hâte de goûter à ma bière préférée, la Chi asiatique au gingembre en fût. De ce côté je n'ai pas été déçue et mon mari non plus: leurs bières sont d'une grande qualité. Par contre, l'endroit est un peu à part, isolé. L'ambiance me rappelait un bar sportif et à ce niveau je n'ai pas été charmée. Situé dans un immeuble industriel aux grands murs blancs, l'endroit m'a semblé un peu froid même si de l'extérieur c'est très beau."}
{"text":"Nous sommes allés pour le 5 @ 7 vendredi. Gros soleil, terrasse remplie. La bière aux pommes recommandée par le serveur était fraîche et sucrée, comme je l'aime. Nous avons décidé de manger : la poutine aux rillettes de canard (4/5, très cochon!), moi j'ai pris le macaroni gratiné, la sauce était épaisse et semblait faite maison.  Seul hic : le crowd. Les gens étaient bruyants et insignifiants sur la terrasse et ca nous a un peu turn off. J'étais aussi un peu déçue qu'ils ne servent pas de Sangria au verre. Prix raisonnable. (7$ la bière et autour de 13$ pour le snack)"}
{"text":"Ils ont une très grande sélection de bières brassées sur place. Nous avons essayé plusieurs de leurs bières. Ils font la chi, une bière aromatisé au gingembre qui est originale. Ils font de bonnes IPA si vous aimez l'amertume.  Leur Poutine à la saucisse allemande est très savoureuse, bien équilibré. Nous avons choisi la version saucisse piquante qui ne l'était pas.  Le tartare au saumon était décevant, le poisson est noyé dans une sauce mayonnaise. Le goût n'est pas assez relevé.  Le service est sympathique et rapide."}
{"text":"I had the stout beer, which was quite good. My partner enjoyed his brown ale, as well.  I had the Montreal style ribs, which were fall-off-the-bone tender and tasty.  My partner had a burger topped with pancetta and gruyere.  The burger was fantastic!  Prices were quite reasonable, too."}
{"text":"This is a really unique place.  The decor is great, the location is off the beaten path but in the middle of everything and the service was pretty good.    Mind you I have been here a couple times but only for beer.   Great selection but honestly . . . no 5-7 prices?  Typically its two for one or at least some sort of discount.  Even a buck off a pitcher or something.    I know a lot of people who say the same.  Add a deal ANY deal and customers would feel like they got great value and will maybe come more frequently ;)"}
{"text":"Ok en matière de bière c'est un très bon endroit. Par contre au niveau de la bouffe ça laisse vraiment à désirer. Le service sur la terrasse en été est vraiment nul, mais à l'intérieur en hiver il est correct. Manque flagrant de consistance dans la qualité du service.  Pour une fois, ils avaient ma bière préféré en fût. Habituellement ils n'ont jamais la stout café-vanille en fût quand je la demande. On m'offre plutôt de la prendre en bouteille. Ça débute bien la soirée quand tas bière de choix est en stock.  L'entrée de bruschetta est plutôt un tas de tomates cerises coupés en deux avec de l'assaisonnement dessus. On dirait que le chef est trop paresseux pour faire une vrai entré de bruschetta. Les 3 morceaux de pain sec servi avec étaient insuffisants pour accompagner l'assiette de tomates. Pas d'oignons...je croyais que des bruschetta, il y avait des oignons d'habitude là dedans. Bref, pour une entrée c'est décevant.  C'est peut-être moi mais quand tu paie 18$ pour une poutine tu tattend à avoir ce qu'il y a sur le menu. C'était écrit épaule de porc braisé, pomme verte, chedar, sauce à la bière ambrée et salade de choux. Malheureusement, la poutine était trop grosse, trop simpliste et aucunes pommes vertes. Je doute que le porc ait été braisé. Je considère qu'elle était cheap pour le prix. J'aurais pas payé plus de 10$ pour ça.  Le burger était correct, mais la salade de choux n'était pas une salade. c'était un tas de choux avec un peut d'huile dessus."}
{"text":"J'aime beaucoup cette place pour prendre un verre ou pour aller manger un bon lunch ! De la bonne cuisine dans un decor industriel avec une bonne bierre de qualité, quoi demander de mieux pour un souper réussi !   Generalement, je vais a ce restaurant pour diner , car le service est rapide et pas trop dispendieux ! Mais pour souper cest aussi tres biens !"}
{"text":"Beware! Babies and kids are not allowed in this place. It's very inconvenient and surprising as all the other microbreweries and pubs in the area do welcome kids.   We went there last night and were told after ordering for the first part of our group that our friend who just arrived with her baby couldn't stay because the place didn't have the permit to allow kids. Unfortunately we couldn't cancel our orders to switch to the pub next door (Lord William). But I wish we did.   The nachos we ate was very plain. I had problems digesting it all night and it's not related to the only beer I consumed. The nachos at Lord William is WAY tastier.   The service was also very plain. There was no kindness at all after my friend and her baby got kicked out. No apologies were made...   Bathrooms had no real soap (a mix of water and soap in an empty bottle) and lacked paper to dry our hands during the few hours we were there.   Too bad that our group who live in the area had this experience. We won't go back to this place and will advise our friends to do the same. So many other cooler places in the area!"}
{"text":"Quaint (yet large) bistro for fantastic food!  Lunch was ridiculously cheap - delicious cabbage tomato soup, beef stew and dessert for under $20 per person!  Loved the environment and you can't go wrong with the food."}
{"text":"This will now become my place for happy hours. Great beers, I was impressed by the various flavours. Loved their rebelle, orientale, and stout cacao beers. However, it was hard to finish their stout with absinthe! Anyhow, it was delicious with the poutine. Just got the classic. Even for a girl, the small portion was too small and would recommend the bigger portion that wasn't that much bigger. Otherwise the other meals had fair portions."}
{"text":"I'm obviously not a beer expert, but I found the drafts quite tasty. My first glass, a Van der Bull  Belgian beer, was an easy-drinking light-coloured beer with notes of citrus. It had more personality than Le Cheval Blanc. For my second glass, the waitress recommended the café-vanille stout, a dessert beer that had an intense aroma of coffee liquor but easier to drink. It was lightly carbonated and un-bitter.  The $12 salsa appetizer was nothing special in terms of taste but it was generous enough to share. $2 extra for guacamole that I'd skip next time. I found the terrasse setting and quiet location of the brewery pretty cool. So was our waiter Léonie who was very attentive.  Again, not a beer expert, but for a recreational drinker, I found that there was enough choice to find something interesting."}
{"text":"Mmmm la Griffintown est très bonne. Resto-Bar qui a une simplicité qui fait tout son charme. Très illuminé avec un décor au style du quartier. Ils ont un menu midi varié, de même que leur menu régulier. Bref, je vous conseille fortement d'y aller"}
{"text":"Situé dans un coin très tranquille de Montréal, il y a du stationnement gratuit sur Ottawa. À l'intérieur, ça devient très bruyant dès qu'il y a plus de la moitié des tables d'occupées. La terrasse est très bien. Le personnel est très gentil et accommodant et ils savent parler bière. C'est très apprécié. Mais le menu n'est pas la raison pour faire le détour. Pizza, poutine dont la sauce est excellente, burger, et très peu de choix sans viande meublent le menu. Malgré les bonnes saveurs et la qualité des aliments, c'est trop ordinaire comme présentation et choix au menu. C'est une bonne brasserie locale avec du beau monde, mais côté resto il faut pimper le menu pour que j'y retourne."}
{"text":"I was looking for a restaurant in the area and this one looked like a good choice...I really wanted the Mac and cheese after seeing the picture here on yelp, but it turns out they just changed their menu last week and they no longer make the Mac and cheese :(  I ended up ordering the table d'hôte which was onion soup, grilled cheese with smoke meat, and pudding Chomeur. The soup was pretty good. My main meal seemed a bit cold...both the fries and the grilled cheese. The taste was pretty good, but nothing super special about it. For the price ($18) I thought it wasn't worth it.    The service was pretty good though. The restaurant is big with a very simple and plain look to it...nothing really fancy or special about it either."}
{"text":"We were looking for a local brewery and a place to get a quick bite after our workout.  Found this spot based on one of the locals recommendation.  Not a bad place and didn't really stay that long as we wanted something quick and easy.  I ordered their fish and chips and one of their darker beers which kinda tasted like chocolate! Good stuff!  Friends ordered an ipa and a heff I believe.  Overall decent experience..service was great and recommendations from the staff were good as well.."}
{"text":"We tried to go here and the place was rented out; they only had signs on the door in French and the people were very rude when we walked in and did not know. It looked run down; the other location is way better."}
{"text":"J'adore la bière et celle des Brasseurs de Montréal est excellente. Les repas sont copieux et succulents. N'y allez pas si vous êtes à la diète. La terrasse est très agréable en été. Un oasis dans Griffintown. Un arrêt obligé quand vous passez par là en vélo."}
{"text":"Good bar food and excellent IPA.  This was a great local place to check out on our vacation to Montreal.  Staff was friendly and fast, smoked meat poutine was delicious and the fish and chips was well done. We shared a pitcher of the IPA which was an excellent brew."}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty good in terms of its beer selection. The location is also pretty interesting as it's off the beaten path of downtown Montreal, but still very accessible.   My only gripe is the extremely poor service when trying to make reservations on the telephone at the Griffintown location. The staff/manager is beyond rude and abrasive.   However, if you don't have to make a reservation, you'll be spared the lack of customer service and likely have a terrific experience once onsite."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Montreal. Love the poutine and beer. Will come back again. Staffs are nice"}
{"text":"I checked in with some clients for lunch fully expecting to wait hours to get my food as per previous Yelper reviews but was decently surprised on how quickly we were served by the friendly staff.  Didn't drink any alcohol (work policy) but definitely had their smoked meat poutine. The poutine was a bit too salty but it was very good nonetheless with the portion being just right.   The price tag was decent as well.  Location is a bit out of the way but hey, my car was still there when I left, so that's always a good thing for this part of town right? :)"}
{"text":"No. I do not like this place. This is my 4th time here always 5@7s. Sometimes super busy sometimes empty. I would give it 2 stars only but...   The concept is alright. The food is fine i guess, a bit overpiced 'cuz it's 'hip to charge more' for things. The red wine choices are good... But again hip to overprice (over 1/2 the price of the whole bottle for just one glass). The service is friendly/nice enough.   But the service. Is. Always. Sooooo. Slow. My gawd.   Coworker who's been waiting for her plate of food for 45 minutes: \"the waitress just explained she totally forgot to place my order in the kitchen, she's going to do that now... It's ok she's probably new\"   Me: \" um actually she was here the last time i was here....prolly about 2 years ago.\"  Coworker: \"oh.\"   Yah i spose it's not the worst thing in the world but seriously it always happens here. Always. You will wait for something. It might not be ur meal....it might not be ur drink... It might not be ur bill...but it will be one of them. Guaranteed."}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice, albeit far from the city center, catering mostly to those who are around Griffintown  The service is slow during peak hours (lunch for example) but it seems it's more due to the popularity than any fault of the team really.  The food is nice and nicely presented, and there are good choices.  Didn't try the beer unfortunately, that'll be for next time"}
{"text":"Les brasseurs est une bonne alternative aux Cages au Sport et aux Stations des sports de ce monde. Il y a moins de télé, mais l'ambiance y est et les plats sont tellement de meilleure qualité! Il y a de très bons burger, mais aussi des tartares, des salades, des crab cakes, etc! Et les entrées ont toutes un p'tit quelque chose qui fait que tu as envie de les prendre!   Sinon, leur bières sont toutes très bonnes! Elles sont brassées sur place, ce qui est encore plus cool !!   Une bonne brasserie et une bonne ambiance ! Je vous le conseille !!"}
{"text":"Incredible place. Excellent assistance from the bartenders, wide veer selection, acceptable prices (it is \"$$\", not \"$\"), and a great physical presence -- both in the taproom and on the patio. Yelp can get over this review being \"shorter than most\" -- the point is that you should try this place. Take the metro to the Guy (\"Gwee\") stop, turn left out the exit, and turn left down Guy street all the way until it ends."}
{"text":"I have spent so many evenings drinking one of my favorite beers in the entire world at Brasseur de Montreal and it appears haven't written a proper review about them yet. In case you wonder which is this beer, it is the Oriental Chi, ginger and lemongrass infused deliciousness. Of course different people have different preferences, at Brasseur de Montreal you can be pleasantly surprised, just have the tasting flight.   The restaurant located in Griffintown used to be off the beaten path for years, located in very industrial environment, where even the close access to the canal Lachine biking path was not as obvious. That has certainly changed in recent years with the endless constructions around. The owners of the brewery sensed the possibility of growing business, expanded the internal space and redid the nice patio few years back. Now parking around is becoming almost impossible due to so many new inhabitants that moved in the area and public transport is not any convenient yet.   The food at Brasseur de Mntreal is simply good. I'm a hugely addicted to their sweet potato fries and have enjoyed everything on the starters part of the menu. The poutine options are outstanding, recently had the duck confit version, so yummy. There are salads and serious dining options depending on your appetite. The outdoor terrace is beautiful, but I have learned through the years service may get atrociously slow, when there are too many customers. I prefer to simply sit at the bar, pints and food come fast and with smile. The restaurant has a full alcohol menu, so if you don't like beer, but just a good bite, you will be still satisfied."}
{"text":"Service très décevant ! La nourriture est très ordinaire. Loin d'être une bonne microbrasserie montréalaise."}
{"text":"I went to the Brasseurs de Montreal last week with a group of friends to take advantage of the first warm terrace worthy night of the summer. Truth be told I've been here a few times before with about the same results every time.  To start this place has a nice terrace, in the middle of Griffin Town. I'm not sure how many it can seat but it's allot since we were ten at our table and there were quite a few other tables with groups around us and we still felt like we were the only ones there.  The service always seems to be a little slow but nothing too bad and since I'm always there with friends it's nice to have the time to talk. I would like the wait staff to be quicker with the first round drinks. I wouldn't suggest Les Brasseurs de Montreal if you're in a hurry but if your out for a nice night with friends  it's a fun place to be and you might not even realize that the service is a little slow.  Being a microbrewery this place makes a full compliment of beers that will please any beer drinker. I must admit that I am not a big beer drinker but every time I come here I find a beer that I like, last time we shared pitchers of sangria and that was also good.   The food is your typical pub fare with burgers, bavette, nachos and sandwiches on the menu. The food is OK the quality average, it really isn't bad but you wont rant and rave about it the next day. I realized the food here was nothing to write home about when the day after I couldn't remember what I'd had for diner.   Nothing about Les Brasseurs de Montreal stands out but that's what I like about it. It's a nice neighbourhood spot where you can go grab a drink and something to eat with friends on a nice terrace or even inside when the weather is cold and if the company is good you're sure to have a good time."}
{"text":"La bière est bonne mais j'sais pas, l'hiver c'est mort. Le service était relaxe et un peu trop pour une soirée aussi peu remplie. On a bu une bière et on est tous reparti. L'alarme est partie pendant 5 minutes. Le Serveur s'Est excusé et je dois admettre que j'm'en foutais un peu, j'n'ai pas eu de problème avec ça. C'était plus qu'il manquait d'ambiance et c'était plutôt moche    La bière je l'aime beaucoup et c''est vraiment dans mes bières préférées de Montréal. J'entre toujours dans un bar en observant le décor, la table, le service, les prix, l'ambiance et je me dis: Si c'était ma business: Qu'est-ce que je changerais. Dans ce cas, la bière rien! Le menu, j'ai entendu des trucs plutôt moyen mais je ne peux me prononcer. L'été c'est mieux que l'hiver je dirais, je crois que ça se termine là. Comme J.F H disait, l'été la terasse est assez bien et souvent remplie. Pas trop cher niveau bouffe avec un choix typiquement bistro: pas de casse tête. C'était ma deuxième fois que j'y allais. Si j'y retourne ce sera en été car l'hiver, c'est mort."}
{"text":"À découvrir dans Griffintown ! Vraiment bien ce resto-brasserie, la place est belle, la bière est bonne et la bouffe délicieuse et abordable ! J'y retourne pour sûr !"}
{"text":"One of the most known brewers of the city, aptly named \"Brewery of Montreal\". The franchise has three locations in Montreal, but this one, although far from the downtown core, is worth the detour. Located in Griffintown, once an industrial neighborhood now slowly gentrifying to the pace of the new stores being opened on its pedestrian streets. Accessible by transit from a short walk from the Lucien-L'Allier metro station, this bar also sits in a bike friendly neighborhood. The patio is locatedon on a street with little or no cars, near the Lachine canal--differs from the more noisy and busy other locations.  Brasseur de Montréal is known for its beers: be warned that their food menu, somewhat extensive at first sight, is deceiving. I ordered a fish and chips plate whole my fellow Yelper got a plate of nachos with extra guac. Hips were soggy and I was surprised that the fish wasn't fried in a beer batter--after all, it's a brewery! Malt vinegar wasn't available, too. The nachos were as equally deceiving, and the extra guac cane with a $2 price tag...  However, the beers made up for the ffood that we ordered only as finger food. Got the IPA and La Rebelle Québécoise, and they were as described: hoppy and slightly for the IPA, and light and refreshing, with a tart endtaste for the Rebelle. Pleasant beers for patio season!  I only rated three stars because of the disappointing food, but will come back for the beers. A little surprised a brewery this well-known didn't have happy hour pricing and deals."}
{"text":"The beer and beer selection in the place is GREAT ! They have a big fun terrasse that is perfect for couples as well as big groups. I would have given them a perfect 5 or at least a 4 but their location is not that great, located about 15 min away from a metro station outside of the main areas you usually go out and if you come here and it is packed you need to walk 20-30 min to the next place. Also the beer selection is amazing but if you are a vegetarian their food menu is basically fries and onion rings. Still I would come here again just for the beers. I had a couple of stouts that were so unique especially gosttown brewed in absinthe and has a nice anise flavor to it."}
{"text":"Il était temps que je visite Les Brasseurs. Depuis un bout de temps, je bois déjà les bières de cette micro brasserie à la maison mais je n'avais pas encore pris le temps d'y aller pour prendre une bière et une bouchée. Tout près de l'eau, avec une belle vue sur le signe de Farine Five Rose, cette micro brasserie est bien jolie. Le décor me semble un peu typique (industriel-chic) de ce genre d'endroit et j'ai adoré les lumières suspendues du plafond sur des gros bouts de bois. La sélection de bière inclue celles disponibles ailleurs (en épicerie, dans des restos) en plus de quelques-unes saisonnières qui ont des saveurs assez originales (une stout à la vanille et café, ça vous tente?) On y a mangé des calmars frits qui étaient parmi mes préférés en ville. Bien qu'on ait décidé d'aller ailleurs pour le souper, les autres assiettes qui circulaient et la variété au menu nous donnaient l'impression que c'est un bon endroit, autant pour la bouffe que pour les bières. J'ai bien hâte à l'été pour pouvoir m'y rendre en vélo en moins de 10 minutes!"}
{"text":"Great terrasse, nice beers and good selection and super friendly and helpful servers. The patio is dog-friendly and it shows...every single time I have been here, there's been at least 5 other dogs lounging about. The only reason why I am not giving this place 5 stars is because the food is pretty 'meh': the salmon tartare was kinda tasteless, bread was hard and the salads were nothing special."}
{"text":"Montreal's obsession with food and beer is something that should certainly be a welcome thing. Brasseur de Montreal is no exception to this culture.   Brasseur de Montreal does produce a few very interesting and unique creations. Milliseme, and Ghosttown certainly both standing out. The former, a bourbon barrel aged, and Belgian inspired choice.  Plenty of residual malty sweetness, and a high ABV makes it a pleasing, yet deceptively intoxicating choice. The latter, an Absinthe infused stout. The Anise flavor is forward, and notable, but not overpowering.   Unfortunately, the rest of the selection is fairly tame. A Vanilla stout that is pleasing, a blonde that isn't phone home worthy, but enjoyable. The food, it's fine for a pub faire. My last meal wasn't the most memorable, but I enjoyed my time drinking, and have returned to do so again since. I have every intent of Brasseur de Montreal remaining in my choices for local breweries, I just wish I could see more of their one off options."}
{"text":"For local beer fans, the name Brasseur de Montreal is definitely one you will know. The Griffintown-based brewer is a staple of the local microbrew scene and is a personal favorite of mine. However, what you may not know is that they have a full restaurant at their Griffintown brewery. Despite it being so close to my place, I hadn't visited yet. I found myself there on a Saturday night with a small group curious to see if the food matchs the quality of the beer.  The space is rather big - very industrial in look with a window to the kettles behind the bar. They also have a great terrasse space but this being November at the time, not really the right time to enjoy it. On tap, you can find all their beers and some seasonal stuff.... or at least usually because on this occasion, many options were not available - such as all of their white beers. Not quite what you want from a brewpub. At least I could still get a classic Griffintown blond but that shouldn't happen ever.  As a starter, we went for the BdM sweet potato fries with chives, garlic, parmesan and spicy mayo. Pretty good overall. The fries were crunch yet not overcooked inside. The mayo had a nice little kick to it. Solid starter. We also got to try the house made fried calamari served with chipotle mayo. Another solid dish - nice crunch to them but they kept the tenderness you want from calamari.  For mains, my fiancé went with the smoked and fresh salmon tartar mixed with apple, chives, sour cream and yogourt. Nice portion size and good presentation. The salmon was fresh and the mix of the smoked salmon is an interesting idea to bend into the tartare however the whole dish felt like it lacked flavour and seasoning - the taste of chives and apples were no where to be seen. The portion of fries that came with it was generous. The salad was okay but didn't bring much.  I decided to go with the pulled pork sandwich - smoked pork shoulder served with bbq sauce, onion compote and gruyere. The pork itself was nice and tender, good smoke to it. The bbq sauce had a nice mix of sweet but smoky however the sandwich could have used more of it. The sandwich felt a little dry as a result. I enjoyed the use of gruyere and the sweetness of the compote worked well. The fries were also plentiful and very good - always love matchstick style.  I left the dinner a little disappointed. The food was okay - good but the lack of seasoning is what can make the difference between a good meal and a great meal. Brasseur de Montreal have great beer and clearly a great terrasse to enjoy - I just wish I could say the same for the food.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"It could be four-star if I found it by chance at Crescent St., not when some one told you there is special place and made you go far from the downtown or old port! I like their beers. The food was OK and their prices are reasonable although I think could be 15% lower."}
{"text":"Tres grand, 2 terrasses collées : une couverte et l'autre à l'exterieur, decoration industrielle et moderne, bcp de bruit, bonne bouffe."}
{"text":"Brasseur de Montréal, is a brewery with bad beer.   Forget the food, the location, and the staff. Brasseur de Montréal serves an exhaustive array of beers that are failures individually and collectively.   This is harsh, but there is really no way around it.   Stop making so many beers, and focus on making one beer good.... or maybe think about becoming a restaurant...."}
