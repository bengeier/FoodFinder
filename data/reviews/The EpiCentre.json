{"text":"I absolutely love alive after 5. Great way to meet young professionals. My friends and I go almost every Thursday. Only thing is the drinks are a little on the pricey side if you are on the rooftop but if you go to one of the bars in the epicenter they have great drink specials for the night!!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience at BUBBLE!!!!!!!! Came out tonight with well over ten coworkers... planned on having a good time, let loose and enjoy time away from work! Ok so I'm dancing with all my coworkers and someone pushes me to where I lost balance, like a full fledge push!! Mind you I'm only one shot and maybe half a beer into the night... anyways I caught my balance and turned around and told the girl \"don't f....n push me\" turns out she works there as a bottle server..... she immediately turns an tells the bouncers something then I get man handled out of the club! All my coworkers seen it and herd the whole thing! We are outraged!! So just because you work there that gives you the right to put your hands on anybody you please??? I think not! Nobody will disrespect me!! I refuse to lower my standard as a human being, plain and simple! They need to get their employees under check and learn proper customer service! Everyone that comes into this establishment is not always a drunken fool... They did not hear us out or let us tell them what really happen... so this establishment condones assult plain and simple! So my coworkers and I will enjoy our biweekly outings elsewhere!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best strip I have been my entire life! We visited for several nights and loved every night. You definitely shouldn't visit by yourself due to the amount of drunk people exiting the businesses at night.   They have everything, still don't understand why Raleigh doesn't have a block like this?????  We will definitely be back, as Arnold would say."}
{"text":"EpiCentre is the only retail destination of its kind in North Carolina, with a diverse mix of restaurant/bars, fast casual food, CVS, a new Aloft Hotel with another hotel coming, a rooftop event space and luxury dine-in movie theatre as well as an upscale bowling alley, both featuring bars. All this in the center of Uptown right on the Lynx light rail line central stop and a new perpendicular streetcar line being built right past the building too.   Whether it's a food/latte stop during your workday, a place to grab drinks after work, a destination date/event with others or a central place to stay while visiting Charlotte, the EpiCentre has it all."}
{"text":"If you're from out of town and you are visiting Charlotte and you want to go out and drink then go to the epicenter. They have clubs, bars, pizza places, all in this center. It's pretty tight. You'll find your spot."}
{"text":"There is something here for everyone. Bars, movie theaters, clubs, you name it! If you live in Uptown Charlotte, this is definitely the place to be! Love the EpiCenter, because there is always something to do."}
{"text":"This place has 2 different times. Day and Night. Day time is not bad. Good little spot to go have lunch or just hang out, but the night time brings out the drunks and losers.   If you want to see drunks, throw up, hookers, and a lot of testosterone then come out at night. This place turns into a sewer at night. Why must this place have so much security? Is it to keep the bouncers/security from beating anyone they want ? Is it to keep an eye on the doorman who sell drugs? All I know is there is security and customers still get beat and robbed.   I would rather not pay for over priced drinks, not step around vomit, and I surely do not want to go any place where the owner is a CROOK!!! Epic center will continue to be a herpes sore on queen city Charlotte."}
{"text":"Being from out of town, the EpiCenter is a total joke. I have never seen such a lump of poorly run businesses all in one place. Although, I do appreciate them all in one clump so I can collectively avoid any happenings here.   I think the literal buildings of the epicenter is set up great- its like downtown Salt Lake City and could be super cool. But its not. Everything seems to usually be closed unless its Friday or Saturday night, and the places I've gone were pretty awful, so much that I've completely ruled epicenter out of my list of destinations. It has just failed too many times.  The concept is there. It's just too bad that all those businesses will have patrons even if the place is run poorly, it'd have to be pretty hard for a club/nightlife bar fail here. Perhaps I have terrible luck with customer service and finding a single employee at any bar in the epicenter that knows what's going on.  Collectively the bars forget THEY ARE IN THE CUSTOMER SERVICE / HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY! This plagues the Charlotte area- all the workers seem to hate their job, while doing it slow and careless. Sorry people came out on Friday to ruin your night.  $10-$15 parking on a regular night is robbery- its a sad tiny little city with few destinations, they should be paying people to come here.  And Charlotte- why do you call downtown Uptown? If that's uptown, then where the heck is downtown?!? Haha."}
{"text":"I think the Epicentre is a lot of fun during the day and at night.  There is a good combination of things to see and do in a relatively small area, and it keeps you from having to walk all over the city.  The bars at night are pretty good, they are at least fun to go to every now and then.  I think as the city continues to grow it will get even better."}
{"text":"Epicenter is fun for a while, when you want a variety to go out and have fun. I do believe a couple of the clubs/bars profile people. I have never been profiled but I have seen it happen. They will let one person in who has boots on and another person who has the same type of boots on gets told the boots are not acceptable. Not sure if I'm the only one who noticed that. I don't go down there much anymore. Never quite sure if what me or my boyfriend Is wearing will be approved of. Why pay so much money to park and meet friends when your not sure if you can get in!"}
{"text":"My opinion depends on the time of day/event. Overall the atmosphere is great, lots of bars, clubs and restaurants in the heart of the city are great. There is even a bowling alley and movie theater. Personally the more crowded nights are overwhelming as there are simply people EVERYWHERE, but that's how a city center works. It's great day and night depending on what you want to do and visit! Perfect location for walking from the light rail."}
{"text":"Nice place. Really enjoyed the proximity to my hotel and all the food choices available."}
{"text":"Very cool place with tons of people, bars, restaurants and options.  Adult Disneyland.  It is what it is.  People know that when they go.  For what it is, I don't see how it could get much better."}
{"text":"This really is an epicenter of many different things. You can come here to eat at the variety of food places they have - ranging from fast food to sit-down dining. You can come here to drink and party. You can come here for dessert. You can come here to watch a movie. You can come here to CVS, lol. There is also a gym, bowling alley, movie theater, bank, and a few other shops. It's a one-stop shop for whatever you're in the mood for."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from New Jersey. And I wish they had one of these closer to me. I love the restaurants and the bars. I just wish they had some shopping other than CVS.  My favorite so far was the taco bar. The staff was so nice there."}
{"text":"Venue: EpiCentre  Decor:   Various, random  Service:   Ok, snobby, more pretentious than what they are, depending on the venue at the complex  Environment:   During the day, casual. At night - mostly young adults, college ages, have to dress to impress. fake ID's and teeny boppers  Food:  Various   Prices: Not to expensive to get into certain places.    Huge Pros:  It is mainly outdoors,  When it  is pouring rain, it is somewhat covered so you don't get drenched. multi level.  Bars, eateries, sports entertainment  Debbie Downers:  You can't frequent here at night unless you are dressed casual.  Therefore, do not show up in basketball shorts.   Conclusion:   A Centralized location is huge for this place.  Right in the heart of Uptown Charlotte.  Right down the street from public transportation, TWC Arena, provides a variety of restaurants, bars, clubs.  It is cool for mainly the 18-21 crowd though.    Overall: B"}
{"text":"I want to hate you, EpiCentre, but I can't deny what you have done for Uptown. I hate your cookie-cutter nightlife, I hate your faux-cobblestones, I hate your cheap beer and your frat-tastic crowd. But I love that Uptown has a life now. There are people around on the weekends, and it's (mostly) because of you.  I liked Alive After Five when it was on Wachovia's plaza and I cursed your name when you stole it up to your rooftop. But I can't deny how nice it is there. Despite my best efforts, I have even enjoyed some of the musical acts. The EpiCentre crowds can be pretty homogeneous, but you do draw an interesting group from time to time.  I am utterly disinterested in every piece of retail in the complex, but I appreciate the effort. A few more stores (maybe one selling clothes for normal people to wear during the daylight hours?) and I won't have to drive to SouthPark for every single purchase. I hate to say it, EpiCentre, but you are a step in the right direction.  Best of luck with your foreclosures."}
{"text":"Jay R pretty much sums it up with \"something for everyone\". Yeah it's a little corporate and ostentatious in some spots, but Charlotte needed something like this in Uptown. While I prefer the surrounding neighborhood spots around town, Epicentre does have some fun spots, such as the theater and the rooftop pavilion for events like Alive After Five in the summer. I enjoy Strike City as well, for sports watching, though the OSU fans can kiss my...well, you know...ha.   Overall, the concept is right, though some of the execution and attitudes of the business owners makes me laugh...you can't deny it adds something positive to the Uptown scene...especially for those short-term out of town guests (insert smile)."}
{"text":"If you ask around Charlotte you're going to get a pretty wide variety of opinions on the Epicentre. Myself, I kinda like the place but in small doses. There is a very decent range of bars to go to and with the movie theater and bowling alley it kinda comes off as a amusement park for adults. The weekends are the best though when the place is fairly crowded, the energy is going and the people watching is prime. The only downside with the place is that when you get that many random drunk people together you are going to run into the occasional asshole. So my recommendation would certainly be to check the place out but as the night wears on tread lightly."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place just because you just have to walk 100 feet to the next bar!!! I love how the bars are so close and its a fun place!"}
{"text":"Had a great time!  Plenty of places to eat and activities in the area.  There are restaurants with views of the city and really enjoyed the rooftop restaurant with live music and good drinks."}
{"text":"I was here on a Tuesday night because I was in town for an interview.  I am originally from Chicago and as soon as I got off of the elevator from the parking garage I said \"oh how CUTE\"  It is neat that all of these restaurants and clubs are all in the same place, and you don't have to drive around and around to find parking.  I thought that the CVS in the middle of it all was kind of weird.  I think that if I get the job in Charlotte, this place will become old fast, but hey, they are trying! Right?"}
{"text":"It's a great addition for the city of Charlotte! Loaded with fun and nightlife with restaurants, bars and clubs for locals and visitors to enjoy!  Some of my friends were in town for the weekend and I took them here so they could see the best of the the city life! They really enjoyed how there were plenty of restaurants and bars to hang out in.   The only downside here is parking, it's a little tricky to find and it's going to cost you at least $10...but I guess that's one of the joys to city living!   Overall, it's a good variety of things to do and places to eat. Great for a fun night out or when you have friends in town.   Look forward to returning again!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience with parking.  No attendant had validated ticket.  Still I paid.  Took 20 min to get out 3 cars deep.  $9 was there just over an hour.  Stay away."}
{"text":"I usually love downtown spots like this, but as I get older I realize that they often house spots that are way too mainstream and overpriced.  With that said, this place SERIOUSLY reminded me of the Denver Pavilions on the 16th St. Mall.    We happened to stop in here late on a Monday night, so our options were limited.  We ended up going to BlackFinn, which was a similar A-OK experience.  I could see how this place would be nuts on the weekend!  We only ran into one tool that night - some dude hit us up for a cab fare, and after my buddy gave him $5, he was like \"that's it?\".  Nice.  Jackass."}
{"text":"So this happened tonight. One of the waitress spilled coffee on Hubs. There was no real apology, just a oh yeah let me get some napkins. We've been really disappointed in the food quality, service and now this. We use to love visiting this movie theater but every time we have gave it a chance it's been disappointing: not to mention how filthy the floors were in the theater. Despite the coffee spill and lack of empathy. We still paid our bill and left a tip. Warning this is not the place we use to frequent often."}
{"text":"Excellent place to visit there is a bar for every type of crowd and taste in music a lot of the places have outdoor areas that overlook the city it was so fun I went twice and there's a lot of place on bikes for safety"}
{"text":"As far as the day goes it a nice place to goto, but when its dark I don't feel like they want my business and I don't mind going somewhere else and letting people know how they are (My money spends the same Epicentre its 2012 get it together)."}
{"text":"I really like the concept of EpiCenter, but I'm not a fan of the location & the parking situation. Charlotte is notorious for \"let's see how much we can pack into downtown / uptown\".  I worked an event there Saturday night & the place was packed full of people - all walks of life & all ages.  Pros: Plenty of opportunities to entertain yourself, whether it's Mez (movies), dining, dancing, bowling or drinking.  I like the idea of being able to have everything all in one space.  The layout is really nice.  Cons: As others noted, it's busy. Traffic is horrible trying to get in.  There's limited parking & you have to pay for it.  I've also heard via friends that the attitude is very stiff & as always dress code is not \"one size fits all\".  Some things are acceptable at some places, but may not be at another establishment.  If you're looking for shopping / retail, you won't find it here (which is what uptown / downtown lacks).  All in all, it's a money maker for Charlotte & that's a plus!"}
{"text":"The EpiCentre is great for a few things; plenty of places to eat, drink and be entertained.  These are all the great reasons you would visit the EpiCentre.  On the other hand you better be prepared for crowded bars, expensive drinks, and a whole lot of chaos.  My favorite time to visit the EpiCentre is during the day it's more chill you can sit outside, relax and enjoy some great people watching.    I recently had a chance to check out the Biergarten at Pavilion on the top floor of the EpiCentre.  The place was dead when I was there I was 1 of 4 customers there but I liked the atmosphere and they had a good selection of beers on tap.    If your looking for a place to entertain some out of town guests the EpiCentre has plenty to offer."}
{"text":"You know, I'm not a big fan of The EpiCentre in general, but there have been a few things lately that have bumped this \"what would have been a 2-3 star\" review up to a 4. I know. Pretty ridiculous, but here's why.   I'm not gonna touch on the \"blah blah blah bar scene, blah blah nightlife, blah blah alive after 5, blah blah clubs,\" etc. Also, why even bother with the parking situation? If you want to complain, then park elsewhere and walk. Yes, it's expensive. Correct, NO ONE validates. Big deal. What I love is to see who is moving into this space and making it have more hospitable appeal.   Cool Offices: Charlotte Hounds (Pro Lacrosse) Charlotte Checkers  New: Studio Movie Grill And soon to be more, from what I've heard  I'm excited to see this place get a little bit of a facelift from the besmirched record it has from years past. It's nice to see them motioning towards a \"family-friendly\" atmosphere and some more daytime appeal."}
{"text":"Seriously? They took a six story outdoor mall and leased to any business with money in hand ready and willing. There are like six random trendy night clubs (we went to Mez) blaring deafeningly loud techno to country, a few fast foodish or bar food type restaurants, an urgent care medical center, and a doctors office. Let's just say it's a well appointed cluster.   Lest we forget the patrons ... Sleezy and cheesy, slutty and smutty - also a total cluster. Like the random pervy man that just started taking our picture without permission or the Very Short Jersey Shore type man that tapped me on my shoulder and gave this gem: \"Brian?\"  Me: (insert puzzled look here) \"No.\" Very Short Jersey Shore type man: \"Can we have your name? I seem to have lost mine.\"   Shaking my head..."}
{"text":"Avoid this place at late night unless you want to be surrounded by drunks and homeless !!!!   Hey great place to visit during the day,you got fancy restaurants,bars,fast casual restaurants ,and even a bowling alley/movie place! Variety of foods to choose from too,from tacos to sushi you name it!  Wings,Italian,gyros,and frozen yogurt !   As soon as the night hits, ouuuuuu the wolfs are coming out! Lol just kidding. You get the point!   I would give this place a solid 4 stars during the day,at late night probably 1 star."}
{"text":"A movie theater, a CVS, and a lot of bars and restaurants.  What more do you need when you travel.  I liked this because I was able to get a lot done in one place.  Great place for a weary traveler."}
{"text":"Epicentre has a bad stigma attached to it.  Now I can agree with most comments about drunken frat boys ( or 30 yr old frat boys), but what do you expect for a mall full of bars.  Anytime you are here just consider yourself to be at a pub crawl.  There are some bar duds (cough whishkey river), but there are some gems like mez, kasbah, strike city,   suite, howl at the moon, and blackfinn.   I have yet to make it to the theater. I hear it is awesome though.  Epicenter is a great place to start your night just to feel if the crowd is going to be good or not.  I usually make it back here @ 2am just for some drunken Moe's/Libertto's though.   It's a great place to people watch and if you don't see anything good make your way to the stairs.  There is always a drunken girl who can't walk in heels and trying to make her way down.  It's a great place to bring people from out of town and a great place to get hammered and seen a mass of amount of people more hammered than you."}
{"text":"There are two things that redeem the EpiCentre from being a pitiful one star for me. 1: Living a couple blocks away, I might conceivably find one or two of the shops here convenient one day. And 2: It's quite an attractive building if you can ignore the unfinished bits of concrete and rebar sticking out of the top like broken promises. But that, I'm afraid, is as far as my considerable generosity will stretch.  I suppose if pretentious places like Mez, Kazba or (heaven forbid) rapey places like Whiskey River are your scene then this place is probably \"totally sick\" or even \"wicked awesome, bro\". But it's not mine. And well, it's my review. Let Fratty McKegstand and Roofy McDouchebag write 5-star reviews in between fist-pumps.  Out celebrating multiple January birthdays, one of my fellow newly 30-somethings decided he wanted to go to Kazba so badly that he paid the cover for all those that didn't want to go. After 45 minutes witnessing the sort of behavior that makes one wonder if humanity would even be worth saving from a global cataclysm, we decided to leave. Once out the door and past the velvet rope (how cliche!) a friend of mine decided to say \"bye, douche bag\" to one of the ruder bouncers.   Evidently the bouncer's Napoleon complex would not let such an affront to his character stand and tried to forcibly keep my friend there against his will. After some tugging on shirts and threats of violence, cops were called and the little shit actually had the nerve to claim legal high ground. I'll admit it wasn't the most dignified action I've seen from my friend but it was a personal remark of someone as he was leaving. He broke no law. So if I'm not mistaken, that's false imprisonment.   Fortunately, an employee from next door who was apparently familiar with the little Road House Bonaparte's antics saw the whole thing and made sure the cops knew what happened. Still, the officer told us to leave the EpiCentre; which was pretty fucking convenient as that's exactly what we were trying to do in the first place."}
{"text":"Oh, the EpiCentre. Where shall I start. When I first moved to Charlotte, you welcomed me with open arms. It was a good relationship. I go to you on the weekends, you entertain me with tons of drinks. I wake up and check my accounts and get pissed. #YoungLove ... Going there sober you notice, in the words of the poet, rapper and avid jail visitor, Christopher Brown, \"the EpiCentre ain't loyal\". There's a lot to do, bars, restaurants, even bowling and deluxe movie lounge. With so many options though, the crowd it draws is often large and annoyingly diverse. Meaning there's a bunch of variety in the type of people, but none that you would necessarily want to hang out with for longer than 30 minutes unless you're plastered. The bachelorette party with penis beads, the douches with popped collars, the small number of milfs, the large number of non-milfs, the college kids, etc. Following the principles of supply and demand, the drinks are more expensive compared to other neighborhoods which don't draw that large of a crowd. If you're new to the Charlotte area, go to the EpiCentre. Live it up. Ride the mechanical bull at Whiskey River. Wait in line for Bubble only to get in and see that it's empty. Get a late night slice. Do what makes you happy. If you've lived in Charlotte for a while, avoid visiting it regularly (minus Alive at 5). You'll get annoyed. It's fine once every two months, but definitely not an every weekend kind of place."}
{"text":"Fun place to check out! Whether you want a sports bar, dance club, bowling, movies, food, or just a good place to people watch!"}
{"text":"I really like EpiCentre, but I hate the people that roam around the place. You know the people that I'm talking about, the preppy frat guys, college kids, and the people with inflated egos. Well that mostly changes when you walk into some of the venues offered here surprisingly. I guess most people just come here to wander around and look important.  There's not much to buy here but plenty to eat and do. I love the theater here, cause it has a bar and other theaters don't duh! But the Mez it's attached to is a let down.  I think I'll stay away from Suite and Whiskey River where the college kids hang out and head over to Kazba which tends to draw a more mature crowd. Strike City is a little expensive but it's worth paying a little extra for a full bar while bowling! I haven't tried much of the food here, but Libretto's has a satisfying pizza, and cold stone is good as usual. I'll have to try to come to an Alive After Five sometime as I hear it's a ton of fun.  At the end of the day I wish I could hate you Epicentre, but I love all the interesting things you have to offer. So like an addict I'll keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"More of a Portal to Food and Entertainment that a Destination in of itself.  Back in the 1970's, this was the site of the Civic Center which was interesting architecture but not the most user friendly place.  I even went downtown for the implosion when the brought the place down.  The plans that emerged for the place was an entertainment venue at the bottom topped by a high rise luxury hotel. The first part was built but then the crash of 2007 and 2008 hit and financing dried up. The high rise hotel part was never built although a luxury boutique did finally emerge.  There are over 24 restaurants here and by the time you add in the bars and nightclubs and a couple of retail stores, you have somewhere on the plus side of 40 places to explore.  A number of good places to dine ranging from national chains to an upscale Steakhouse is located here.  A number of excellent nightclub, some with live entertainment also find a home here.  Can't find what you are looking for, you can also catch a movie or go bowling as well.  All of these can be found here plus more."}
{"text":"Once a year I return to my native state to visit family and friends. On the weekend, my best friend and I usually travel to one of the bigger cities in NC to hang at the bars to watch football and nascar, eat wings and drink waaay too much all in close proximity to a hotel.  This year, he decided on the EpiCentre in downtown Charlotte and I have to say he made an awesome choice. This place is epic and truly the center of everything. The Loft hotel where we stayed is attached to the complex and the elevators drop you off at any floor where a myriad of bars and restaurants are located. The hotel could be reviewed by itself but I'm including it with this one.  Part of the Starwood hotel group, the hotel has great views of the city, nice comfortable beds, and great climate controlled rooms.  Once out of the room, it's on to whatever type of bar or restaurant you want to indulge in from Sushi, steaks, burgers, wings and the bars host all football fans and most of them have live music if that's your bag.  We planned on hitting most of them but never left this place called Coltrane's Grill. Nothing much to brag about as they only have a couple of TVs but being the main people in there for most of the day afforded us both of the TVs to watch our teams play and the NASCAR race.   Left one time to visit another place on another floor called Wild Wings for some......wings, and then it was back down to Coltranes. I would love to tell you about the other establishments but we chose not to visit them as they seemed to be hosting fans of particular teams. Nothing wrong with this at all, we just chose to no intrude with like minded fans which we had nothing in common with.  We have already decided that we would hang here again next year as it seems to be the best place to indulge in everything without getting into too much trouble.  Just a tip: Best not to be here the next time a riot breaks out as I seen taking place the day I checked out."}
{"text":"I love Club Suite (best music ever, mostly Hip Hop & R&B) and the restaurants are good here also. Mixed crowd and I've never experienced any BS. Whisky River is a good place also. Alive after five on the rooftop is a good time."}
{"text":"Gorgeous view!  Drinks were a little pricy and peculiar.  Didn't have a chance to try their food as we just popped in for a late night drink and  wanted to check out the rooftop view. Bet it is fun place when the weather is just right.  It happened to be a tad bit chillier than we expected.  They do have a cool fire pit that add to the ambience of the location."}
{"text":"An entire city block party on a Thursday?!  Why not!  Live music that had top notch performance value.  Only reason I took a star away is because I had to fly out the next day and was on my deathbed the whole flight(too much fun i suppose)."}
{"text":"Depending on what you come here for, if you're visiting Charlotte and you want to check out the night life this is mostly where it's going to be at (there are other options though!) This place is full of restaurants, clubs, and bars. I have came here several times for clubs, movies, sushi, and well for this time to bowl (my review in StrikeCity is listed). However, every time I come here I'm reminded of how limited the spots in Charlotte are and how special this place is. It's always packed with people, so if you're in a social mood this is where to go.  So, come here and have some fun! If you go to the Mez, they have a high class restaurant and a movie theater (and you can eat in there) but make sure to reserve for opening nights. I came here to watch the final Harry Potter movies (which was amazing).  Epicenter has places to park, and close to mostly everything if you want to walk around Charlotte. And it's also very close to the light rail if you don't want to drive all that way (just get off at 3rd street and walk there!)"}
{"text":"The EpiCentre has a little bit of everything. Restaurants, shops, clinic, bars, clubs, movie theater, rooftop bar, etc. In my opinion this is a perfect place for newbies, transplants, business travelers, and visitors. It's located downtown, there is plenty of lighting, and security can be easily found."}
{"text":"My brother tried to warn me. This is nothing like DC, or ATL, or even Athens, GA. But, I didn't listen. I guess I assumed Charlotte was a nice mid-size city with plenty to do. My poor brother is awfully bored, and I see why. The EpiCentre seems like the kind of place that is great for teenagers, and out of town family (like myself) to check out while passing through. For residents (like my brother), I can see how this gets old fast. But, alas it's a handful of restaurants (some staple chains can be found), bowling, movies, and night clubs (If you want to call it that). I think with more shopping options this would be a more solid destination."}
{"text":"This is a definitely a hot spot at nights and on the weekend, but if you are like me I can I'm the middle of the day on a weekday! The security is nice and pleasant - I had to ask them a question. There are both steps and an elevator (if you have children or strollers). The area is well kept, I did not see any debris on the ground. Plus, they have valet parking - if you need it for the weekend!"}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for work and decided to check out the EpiCentre everyone told me about.  Nice place to find food.  Other than that, it felt kinda...slow-paced there.  I was really hoping for a place to shop.  Doh!"}
{"text":"Sort of like a strip mall. There are many shops, restaurants, all packed into one place. I can see why this place would be a tourist draw or a place to check out while visiting Charlotte.  We ventured here in search of a quick meal. Lots of options, but not of the best quality. The CVS here has saved me a few times for travel emergencies so I will give it that. This place is in walking distance of the large convention center. Close to hotels as well. It gets a little rowdy around evening as there are quite a few bars here.  Good if you're stuck in the area, but nothing I'd go out of my way to visit."}
{"text":"I love the epicenter! It has everything you can need for a out. Bars, restaurants, and the even a local CVS can get be found. Parking can get pretty pricey if you want to be in comfortable walking distance. All in a good place to start if you're looking for a night out in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This reminds me of a City Walk, Hollywood/Highland or a Downtown Disney.  Gentrified restaurant choices, movie theatre, area for live music, etc.. The people milling around seemed a bit off to my husband and I.  We wondered if there was a chubby prostitute convention in town.  Plus, alot of people smoking and getting rowdy in the later hours. It was fine for a place to grab a bite and a movie, because we were staying across the street at the Ritz. But I would not pick it as a destination."}
{"text":"Thurs. was my first time at Alive After 5 at the Epicenter.  I was able to get into the VIP section.  Not bad for a rooftop event.  2 bands on the bottom level Suckerpunch and on the roof The Frontiers (they have opened for the group Journey for years).  See you next Thursday."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the EpiCentre area. A few shops, lots of restaurants, bowling, and a dine in movie theater. It's located right downtown so it's pretty much walking distance from any of the downtown hotels. There is a good variety of things to do here which is nice. The place really gets jumping at night and had a good amount of people wandering around. It is a nice change of pace for an otherwise  super quiet city."}
{"text":"Appropriate name since it really does pull together the Charlotte nightlife uptown.  There is a variety of things to do here.  You can go bowling at StrikeCity.  You can eat at Enso or Blackfinn or several other places.  And you can even catch a movie at the theaters located on the second level.    They just put in a Gold's Gym which really comes in handy for those that work and live uptown.  I'm certainly a fan!"}
{"text":"This is the worst place I've ever been because of this ridiculous dress code ! I wear the same cloth to go anywhere, even government agencies and nobody ever told me \"my pants are wrong\" but this place I felt been insulted ! I'm just a normal student with normal clothes everywhere in the street, and this terrible place just made me hate this place. I'll never come to the EPICENTRE again and I'll tell everyone I know about this ridiculous and insulting place!!!"}
{"text":"A nice surprise in Downtown Charlotte. Great at night especially in the summer. Nice restaurants a nice place to checkout."}
{"text":"Grey place to go during the day or night. They have various options of activities and food places. You can go bowling, catch a movie, grab a bit to eat, clubbin, fill a prescription, workout, get a sweet treat, etc. it's great spot for tourist/visitors. I think it's a pretty cool place to go visit and a neat spot in charlotte."}
{"text":"It's kind of cool.  Nice addition to Uptown.  Lots of restaurants with some entertainment options.  The restaurants are wide ranging from Five Guy's burgers, Wings, Sushi, Italian, and many other options.  Most are just three star places.  None of the restaurants really separates themselves from other options in Uptown.  There is a movie theater and bowling (StrikeCity) which are cool.  I would like to see more shopping options at EpiCenter to keep me there.  After checking the place out for a couple of hours, which included getting lunch there, we ended up roaming elsewhere in Uptown.  Note, parking on the weekends at the EpiCenter garage is a little high in comparison to other options close by.  If you go then I would recommend either free street parking or another garage."}
{"text":"Sigh..how does every big city in The South get convinced they need one of these Centers that contain the same boring Chain Bars and Restaurants?...well I know the answer to that question, it's because the right politicians..bankers..financers..and developers all get greased or grease the proper authorities to get the project approved..then the Mayor has a Press Conference announcing what a coup this Development is for the city and the jobs and tax revenues it's going to provide while conveniently failing to mention the long line of similar developments like this that have failed all over The South like Underground Atlanta..The Jacksonville Landing..Channelside in Tampa..BayWalk in St Petersburg and CocoWalk in Miami and I am sure there are others I don't even know about..The Epicentre has all the standards that could be in \"Anytown USA\"...Wild Wing Café..Whisky River..Howl At The Moon..Five Guys..Jason's Deli..A Bar/Bowling Alley.. a Movie Theatre and numerous other bars and clubs...Fine people of Charlotte I can tell you exactly how it's going to go because I have seen this movie before...first two years will be great...everyone's making money..years 3 and 4 crime there will start to rise and the good people who used to come and spend money will start to avoid The Epicentre...year 5 businesses will start closing...Year 5 and 6 The Original Developer will try to sell the whole thing and/or start missing his bond payments and foreclosure becomes a possibility..by Years 7 and 8 most of the businesses have long since closed and the whole Project will have been bought and sold two more times for 10 cents on the dollar or will have been foreclosed on...Years 9 and 10 will be 2 years of local politicians arguing about what to do with the empty downtown building before finally deciding to turn the whole thing into High-End Condos that will be developed by the guy who offered the right \"incentives\"...sorry to be the bearer of bad news Charlotte but this is how it will end...To me the whole project was unnecessary in the first place because downtown Charlotte has a nice bar and restaurant scene without The Epicentre...and I can't believe all the high end Hotels nearby like The Omni and The Ritz Carlton can be too pleased how the noise from there must keep all the guests in the rooms right across the street up half the night..my advice for all out of towners is to explore downtown Charlotte and patronize the local spots and just ignore this place unless your dying to go to the same places you could go to in your hometown"}
{"text":"Seems to be the best place to hangout in Charlotte. Lots of restaurants ranging from low end to high end. Alive after five also takes place here in the summer time featuring live bands and enormous crowds."}
{"text":"Living down town, this combination of eateries, movies, bowling, shopping, dancing, and dining along with live music in the summer is what every downtown needs.  Add in a huge sport venue a block away and it cannot be beat.  Being a resident it is my go to place that I can walk too........and walk home from......let me repeat that for all you folks that take cabs back to whereever and drive after hitting the bars......it is my go to place that I can walk too........and walk home from when I get my party, food, whatever on.  I don't club that much and so many other establishments are within 2 blocks there is never a situation that cannot be adjusted, changed, or improved by going somewhere else.  Great setup for great times."}
{"text":"A nice array of restaurants but not much else here. I was happy to see one nice store near the top, but the rest of the storefronts belonged to expensive restaurants and entertainment (bowling and a movie theater). I think this place could be pretty cool if it had a bit more shopping. It would definitely be more well rounded."}
{"text":"Love the EpiCenter! I always have a blast here. Blackfinn, Suite, and Bubble are some of my favorite places. Looking to avoid paying cover and the crazy crowds? Well Take your boring cheap ass up to Aloft WXYZ lounge and enjoy the stunning view of the city. I will say parking sucks, however.... across the street at \"whatever-something\" tavern it's $5."}
{"text":"so much in one place you don't need to go anywhere else! there is something for everyone and the train drops you off right in the center of it. walking distance to the Cricket arena, shopping, amazing food smells, bowling, movies. It is literally all right there!  I may have to come back for a day trip!"}
{"text":"I still remember when this location was the Charlotte Convention Center (gasp!).  Luckily with time, brings change, and this change was a good one.  After the implosion of the old building and the new multi-use building started going up, it was pretty exciting.  Now I know the condos never finished so there's a night blight every time you look up and see the unfinished concrete columns and rebar reaching for the sky, but maybe one day.... I would think the rest of the parts of the EpiCenter are pretty successful.  A great way to go out and have so many choices within ridiculously close walking distances from each other.  The other day we went to see a movie, but decided to have lunch and drinks beforehand... there were so many options to choose from.  Now that Alive After Five has moved over to the rooftop here, there is always something going on.  I haven't been \"out out\" on the weekend, but I'm sure this place is a good option to go with the number of bars and clubs... you can do your own mini bar crawl without having to leave a one block radius of the city.  I like the openness of the place as well - it allows for maximum people watching."}
{"text":"It just doesn't seem very classy.  It's almost gotten to \"tourist trap\" status.  Definitely fun to people-watch there & good for group drinking outings."}
{"text":"A one-and-done multi level city center in the absolute heart of Charlotte, the EpiCentre hosts about what feels like a million restaurant options (some easy, others themey, and most upscale and trendy) and surprisingly pretty much zero clothing shops or boutiques. I was very surprised by this, as the design of the EpiCentre is very familiar to other newer downtown gathering places, yet did not provide much in the retail department as the others do.  None the less, I think they have the restaurant venue down for sure. So many unique and special places to choose from! The place collects young professionals, singletons, and beautiful people and has the vibe of being a great place to meet new people. When we first visited this past weekend, there was an awesome beer tent sans tent event going on which was a fun surprise.  On top of everything, the security team here is amazing! They are very present which makes the place feel so safe and clean, but also laid back and friendly. I would feel comfortable walking around at 2 AM the way they handle their business."}
{"text":"I don't know what to make of the EpiCentre. Is it an outdoor mall? This is nothing to what we have in Dallas, TX. It had restaurants, a CVS, a bowling alley, a movie theatre and a parking gargage. Since it is right across from my hotel, the Ritz Carelton, I had dinner at two of the restaurants, Vida and Enso on two different nights. I even went to the CVS for snacks and drinks. I may go to the movies at the Mez if they are showing anything I'm interested in watching. To me, this is just run of the mill. Maybe I am just pissed because my hotel room faces the EpiCentre and I can hear drunkards yelling at the top of their lungs at 2am while I am trying to sleep and get to work the next day. During the daytime it is nice and quiet. However, if there is an event, which there are a few while I am here, it gets pretty rowdy."}
{"text":"This iconic place in Charlotte has certainly made itself known. Through the years bars and stores have come and gone. Some of them quicker than others. Some we may wish were still here and some we may be aching to see die a quick death yet they persist. I've lived in Charlotte through my 20s for over 10 years now. As I come up on 30 I cast a reminiscent yet \"good-riddance\" riddled nostalgic gaze upon the EpiCentre.  I've been here a time or ten. I've been to most of the places here for one reason or another, but primarily to party and then as a result of drunkenness from partying. The bars here scream barely legal with their litanies of 21 year olds (at least that's what their IDs say). Everyone's looking to let go a little. Get tipsy or more. Go home with someone new and never talk to them again. College kids abound, I can't wait to see what happens when the light rail is open from UNCC all the way to here.  You can eat a dinner in a movie theater (Studio Movie Grill) while watching something that just came out. Though I frankly don't recommend it because you can't see your food and for me that's a bit weird. (Do they really have to worry about quality?) Or party your heart out at Whiskey River, Howl at the Moon or some other trendily-titled club that won't be here in a few years. Whether you're drunk or sober you can feast on Five Guys (best burgers around IMO), Moe's or a recently added Grabbagreen. Orrrr if you're looking to take a special somebody home, you can stock up on Plan B (maybe try Plan A first) at the CVS.  Whatever brings you to The EpiCentre it's sure to capture your awe whether dead in the middle of a Sunday or crowded to the brim on a Saturday night. On the other hand, I have \"been there and done that\" and I'm happy to say I'm done with it - no more crazy party nights for me."}
{"text":"Cool to walk around, but overall has the feel of an expensive outdoor mall."}
{"text":"The EpiCentre...the center of tons o' commerce, boatloads of people, and many a frat boy also plays host to some real gems.   If you don't like tourists, crowds or popped collars, you may tremble at the thought of EpiCentre on a Thurs-Sat evening. However, take a little time and explore the place when it's not a mass of people and you may grow to appreciate it. Allow me to break it down for you...  The Great: The place is kept up extraordinarily well from the ongoing maintenance and, I assume, a great cleaning crew. Some of my fave non chain places here to hit up when EpiCentre is not overflowing with people: Mortimer's: Catch a bite and a game, Revolution: Cute clothes and shoes, Strike City: Watching any Big 10 game and bowl on someone else's dime, Biergarten: Casual place with long tables with solid beer, Vida Cantina: Guacamole. Done, Mez: Great movie theater when you don't want to deal with lines and such, Libretto's: Tasty quick slice of 'za.  The Suckage: Parking. Sucks. The only two places (that I've found) that validate are Mez (if you go to a movie and even then it's a limited amount of time) and First Physicians. Yup, that's it. So, be prepared to either pay the automatic meter or shell out cash during for an evening parking job. And frankly, these parking attendants have been total ass bags to me in the past...but whatever. And as mentioned previously...The EpiCentre can be quite young and really touristy.   While Epi brings in about needed traffic and dollars to Uptown, you just have to plan accordingly to avoid the occasional rage of 22 year old frat boys and drunkies."}
{"text":"Movies, tanning, booze, yogurt, sushi, bowling, gym. You name it... they've got it. All packed in this one place.  I could write a book about The EpiCentre, but who has time for that? I'll focus on the key things you should know.   The parking deck: is expensive as hell. I recommend taking the light rail. It drops you off right smack dab in the middle of it. Or, park at Fitzgerald's and have a drink there first. They validate for the Wake Forest/Holiday Inn deck right next to it. Short walk to Epi.  Best patios (in order):  Vida- Great people watching. Plenty of room to sit, relax and enjoy the day/evening Bubble- Directly above Vida. The patio opens up into the bar... so you can order drinks at the window without having to walk inside. Suite- Cool VIP areas available outside. Nice to celebrate for a special occasion or a girl's night  Cool things to do: Alive After Five: every Thursday during the Spring/Summer months. HUGE crowd. Live music, outdoor beer and liquor stations, rooftop Pavilion bar takes credit cards.  Strike City Mondays: All You Can Bowl for just $15 all day and all night.  Tourist-y type spots: Whisky River: Dale Jr's bar. You can ride the bull.  Howl At The Moon: Piano bar Tin Roof: Live music  That's cool fact #1: former Panther Muhsin Muhammad owns a piece of Wild Wing Cafe.  Bar with the least EpiCentre feel to it: Mortimer's. Super cool spot to grab drinks.  Oh man the bars are closing and I'm hungry: Five Guys, Libretto's and Moe's all open late night  Final thoughts: there is dress code. It is enforced."}
{"text":"The EpiCentre, as a whole.  It's a tricky mess trying to lump it all into one category, and one review.  As others have said - Daytime EpiCentre and Nighttime EpiCentre are two totally different beasts.  One more beastly than the other, for sure.    During the day/lunchtime there are tons of quick and tasty places to eat (5 Guys, Firehouse, Moe's, Jason's Deli, Libretto's), some sit-down places (Mortimer's, Vida, Enso) and dessert choices (Cold Stone, Yoforia) and if you're coming from the Wells Fargo campus, you can get there and not have to venture outside (unless you count that section of parking garage you have to walk through in the BB&T building \"outside\").  And if you need a go-to pharmacy, the CVS downstairs can't be beat.  I'd give it a 5 star rating for the daytime.  Super convenient for uptown workers and dwellers during the day (we're already parked here somewhere, so it's not an issue).  Now, the evening on the other hand... beast-a-rific.  Dress code issues (really? you're not going to let us in to see X-Men because the hubs is wearing flip flops?), accidentally going to Suite on college night (get off my lawn), parking, traffic, and oh my the drunkie-poos.  Those things all make it a tad unpleasant.... but yet.... There's something about it.  Something about the closeness of the establishments, and the options that you have.  You can go to a few different places that have totally different vibes and never have to walk more than 100 yards.  It's just such a cool concept, and I really do love it.  What we really need to work on fixing is the type of people that end up here.  Maybe... a test before you are allowed on the premises.  I can picture it now.  Set a beer, a funnel, and a tube out on the sidewalk - if you put the 3 together and crush the beer, you aren't allowed in.  Put up a sign with some glitter tubes \"Free Glitter!\"  If you apply the glitter to yourself, you aren't allowed in.  Think that would work?"}
{"text":"Epicentre is a cool place.  It has all of the nightlife you'd want in one location.    I'd say this is great for a smaller city, as it is really convenient, safe, and fun.  But I'd say a large city person (read: new yorkers from new york city) would avoid this place like the plague.    I spent my time at Whiskey River.  It's a large establishment.  Dancing, music, good times."}
{"text":"The best place in town. You got your Studio Movie Grill, where you get good entertainment and good food/drinks. You got your Strike City, where you get to bowl drunk. Howl at the moon is the best piano bar, and Whiskey River is a great place for private events. Haven't been to the Vault yet but I bet it's a good place to party. Bubble is pretty good too. The salmon there wasn't the best but good drinks and great service. My favorite restaurant Enso is also at the Epicentre. So all in all it's a great place.  And if you're going over for lunch or looking for a sports bar, they have Black Finn, Mortimer's, etc. Plenty for everybody."}
{"text":"I've given reviews about individual places some of which are pretty good.  This review is about the complex as a whole.  The reason is for 1 star review is that based on my experience this is in my opinion a very unsafe place.  I base that on my experiences sampling Charlotte Uptown nightlife over the past few years.  By far the most dangerous incidents I've witnessed have occurred in this complex.  You have a number of bars packed together which are more interested in making big bucks to pay the rent than creating a safe environment.  Over serving is a major issue which unfortunately won't get addressed until someone gets really hurt but I've witnessed several examples.  I'm not going to pretend that I haven't partaken in some spirituous beverages myself here.  I can say I've had some great incident free times here.  For all the good times though there have been some ones which weren't so good which have led me to not come here again.  I was leaving one of the establishments.  I made an off-handed silly joke to one of the security staff on a second floor.  IBy the time I got the first floor multiple security were surrounding me and yelling at me.  I was taken aback and asked why.  They proceeded to violently push me and intimidate me.  Not wanting any sort of confrontation and fearing for my safety I did walk away. You don't expect this type of thing to happen as an adult but yeah even though this isn't grade school let's call like it is.  The security staff were bullies.  People that get off using some power and authority when they feel they can get away with it just for kicks.  Mind you the vast majority of security staff at non-Epicenter bars I can tell get it.  They're more interested in helping people than hurting them and violence is a last resort.  Lest you feel that I was just some drunk who got what was coming from him, I'll also share this.  I saw a fight one time for which no security was around to break it up.  I emailed Epicenter and mentioned that I felt there needed there needed to be a better security presence.  Never heard back.  Interestingly other nights the staff specific for certain places sometimes security is nowhere to be found.  It seems to be hit or miss in terms of how much of a security presence there is.    I'm not saying don't go ever to the Epicenter.  Just if you go be very careful.  Traveling with a companion until you get outside the facility is advised.  I recommend leaving before the bars close to avoid some of the more unsavory characters.  Keep your eyes open and try to stay away from individuals that appear to be acting aggressively.  Also keep in mind while there is a police presence they're focused on the outside perimeter and focused more on street traffic than what's going on inside.  I truly hope nothing really bad like someone getting seriously injured or even killed ever happens in the Epicenter.  My goal isn't too post this in the event if something does happen to come back and say I told you so.  Rather I hope anyone reading this affiliated with the Epicenter takes what I've said to heart and tries to make this a safer place.  More and better trained security.  Working with the bars to curtail over serving.  Spend a little more money to make sure every person who comes to the Epicenter feel welcome and safe."}
{"text":"The Movies at Epicentre was disappointing since the seats and tables were dirty - the drinks didn't arrive w the popcorn - such a fun place to watch movies but not very clean anymore ???!!!!"}
{"text":"The Epicentre is a collection of restaurants, clubs, bars, a bowling alley, movie theatre, and convenience stores. This is a great spot in the summer when there are outdoor events. You can usually find a VERY eclectic group of people, all age ranges and races, having a great time dancing after work hours. Parking here can be a pain when there's an event at the arena because they jack up the pricing. Overall, the Epicentre is a great asset to Charlotte and you'll always be able to find something to do. The college crowd tends to dominate after 9pm."}
{"text":"The girl at the mall hyped this place up soooo much when we asked her what was it to do in Charlotte. I was disappointed the theater only had a select few movies and I wasn't interested in any of the restaurants that is located there. It was just kind of Blah, but that's just me."}
{"text":"I really like the Epicentre. I see it as a one stop shop. You can eat, get drunk, work out, movies, bowling, everything. My only beef is the parking deck. The spaces are way too cramped. I never park my car in there. I have no idea how people avoid getting dinged.   My fav places: - Whiskey River - Howl At the Moon - Wild Wing Cafe"}
{"text":"This place has everything from Wild Wing Cafe to an awesome bar Whisky River to a great bowling ally Strike City. If you are looking for an awesome place to go with friends on a Friday night then let this place be it."}
{"text":"EPIC. The EPICenter. haha  - Ate at a few restaurants here. Pretty good. - CVS really close to the hotels - So many BOAs! - Next to the bus stop! - Radio here during a basketball game! win prizes!"}
{"text":"One word to sum up the Epicentre = It has it ALL!  Yea so it's not one word.  You can't use one word, well at least I can't.  Seriously though this place has everything.  The Epicentre is three levels and most every space in the center is filled with great places.  Check the lists below  Nightlife: Mez Kazba Enso Howl at the Moon Whiskey River Suite Blackfinn Strike City Vida Wild Wings  Other: Liberettos Mez Theaters Five Guys Jason's Deli And more..  I know I forgot some there but damn there are a ton of places in this party center.  Parking garage below it and generally will cost ya $10 and its cool if ya leave it over night.  They never give me a hard time when I pick my ride up the next day.  FYI Take a cab home! There are cops everywhere and its not worth the DWI.  During the summers they have an even, Alive After Five, every Thursday.  A free concert at night and the party starts at 5.  The place gets packed with everyone getting off work from all the banks and what not.  Definitely worth checking out in the summers.  Occasionally a live concert is thrown on a Saturday as well.  There is a decent size stage on the third floor and little building that opens up as a bar to serve on the stages patio.  Also live MMA fights are held on the third floor.  Seriously you can spend a whole day here.  Mexican, Sushi, Sports bars, Upscale Lounges, Dance clubs, Shopping of all sorts, bowling, great pizza, and a ton more!  Look at the lists, read reviews on each place.  My general routine is the following:  Enso around 8 PM for Sushi, Blackfinn for a few drinks, Whiskey River for a few more, Mez/Kazba to chill and do shots, back to Blackfinn for shots, then if enough people convince me I'll hit up Suite (I care not for this place), more likely I'll hit an \"exotic\" dance club later... or after Suite.  Come to Epicentre, it has something for everyone."}
{"text":"Good location with various okay dining and entertainment. But the horrible parking and traffic at peak hours can really be a drag. Some rif raf wonders about. The brick pavers are probably deadly for walking drunks."}
{"text":"Let's just say what I love, like and do not enjoy about this place... I'm going to make it easy on all of us...   Love:    * Studio Movie Grill- They're working out those server kinks and it's coming along nicely... AND they validate! * Five Guys- There's nothing better than a greasy cheeseburger and fries after a night on the town... * CVS- It works out great when you're out for said night on the town and you forgot something...  Like:  * Alive After 5- I like hanging out in the cool summer sunshine and there's always a good crowd... * Mortimer's Pub- Their food is actually pretty good! * Cold Stone Creamery- Singing and dancing with ice cream? Yep, I'm on it.  Do Not Enjoy:  * That stupid cobblestone on the bottom floor- Even while sober, it is treacherous at best... Are you actively trying to help drunken girls break their ankles? You know they're trying to be vixens! * Howl at the Moon- I'm not knocking you if that's your bag, but eh... I'm over it... And there's no food?  Whatevs...   Overall, it's okay... Maybe I'm just not their target demographic...  You can't win them all, I guess..."}
{"text":"Really awesome place! Great venue and has a unique vibe. I cant wait to go back during the night to really experience the venue in its full glory."}
{"text":"EpiCentre?  Epicenter of what, exactly...?  This place is strange.  It's a multi-level pavilion that serves as a food court during the daytime and a bar/club area at night.  Odd.  There was a mix of high school(?) and college kids, plus out-of-towners who didn't know where the eff else to go (including yours truly, hah).  But it seems to be one of the few nightlife spots that Charlotte has to offer."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple of Yelp events that were held at establishments here in EpiCentre and I've usually stopped by when I'm headed to something at the Arena. The EpiCentre just isn't a regular \"destination\" for me as there's other stuff further away from the city that I find more convenient.  However, for folks who are in Uptown already then EpiCentre is a great place for a night's entertainment. Restaurants range from inexpensive to spendy, there is a movie theater, a bowling alley and a good few watering holes with a variety of different layouts and styles. There's even a fitness center and a tanning salon.  Because it's right next to the central bus station, there's an... interesting segment of the population here. EpiCentre does have security in the evening hours, which helps.  Parking can be expensive. Do yourself a favor and take the light rail, as it stops right at EpiCentre."}
{"text":"The  EPi Centre  is a beautiful place, but like most of the other places in Charlotte, NC it is full of racism. The clubs in the  EPi Centre are over price for starters. The clubs have policies which they can change at will to keep anyone who they don't like out. This mostly being the case for Black and Brown people. When it is Speed street week , the clubs want you to dress like your on a commercial for GAP, AF, American Eagle. When they are having the NAACP tournament you can dress like your on a P. Diddy video in the 90's in get in everywhere.   I need for the EPi Centre to just to put a Whiteonly sign up when they only want white people to come, then but a Colors only sign up when its okay to come party."}
{"text":"This Centre is Epic! har har, I so funny. I'm not particularly fond of the \"EpiCentre\" nor am I partial to any spot. But I do greatly appreciate the vision and this mini mall concept for adults they got going on.   Live concerts, MMA fights, pretentious bouncers and shady management. From classy women in prom dresses (and no it's not actually for prom), to skanky, I mean swanky chicks in mini skirts & halters in 43 degree weather, to D-bags rockin' Afflliction & Ed Hardy to country boys with cowboy boots and hats. Cougars chasing the polo shirt kids, and old timers in three piece suits looking for their Anna Nicole.   EpiCenter has something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte and this was listed as a top attraction. We were extremely disappointed and even confused. The is a very small 3 story outdoor food court? I was expecting a lot more and the places listed on the map were not even here anymore! Apparently at night there are few clubs on top. I would come back at night but that's about it."}
{"text":"The EpiCentre in my open is a tourist trap. It caters to those visiting Charlotte. Lots of hotels around, restaurants, bars, clubs, movie theatre, etc. Whenever you visit the EpiCentre you usually end up with a mixed crowd. There is always some tourists that are in town visiting mixed with some locals. But I would definitely say that EpiCentre is not anyone that lives in Charlotte's first choice of places to hang out. It is convenient to have different types of restaurants and bars and clubs to choose from all in one place. Each of the bars has a different feel/vibe and plays different music so in a night out, everyone can get their fill by barhopping within the EpiCentre. They have a parking garage attached which is also nice. Some places (Studio Movie Grille for sure) will also validate your parking."}
{"text":"Tons of restaurants from taco joints to Flemings Steakhouse, bars, cafés, a convenient CVS pharmacy, dine-in movie theater, Golds Gym, hotels, bowling alley/pool hall, frozen yogurt and so much more.   Easy access to the Time Warner Arena, NASCAR Museum, Mint Museum, Charlotte Convention Center, railway & bus transportation, valet parking  and so on...  If your visiting Charlotte you definitely want to explore the Epicentre for your shopping, entertainment & touristy pleasures.   ~Christy"}
