{"text":"In a bind for a meal in a hurry, I happened to see Ziz Greek Kitchen while driving south on Woodbine at the last minute. We pulled in about 10-15 minutes before closing - thank goodness!  It's a fast food-casual set up, no frills for sure, but when you're in a hurry, places like this are gold! My fiancee and I couldn't get over how clean the place was, so bonus points to the team on this accomplishment. There is something about a spic and span restaurant and organized set up that lets you know they take extra care, and that translates over to their food.  My fiancee ordered a falafel pita and I went with a single gyro pita. As mentioned by other yelpers, everything is cooked and in warming trays ready to go, with the exception of the falafel which was made hot and fresh to order - very impressive. I was a litle guarded about my gyro not being freshly shaved from the spit but that worry was for nothing. The gyro meat was still very juicy and piping hot.  All the toppings were very fresh as well and the sauces were delicious as well. The one thing that gives them an extra star in my books is the abundance of meat/falafel they give you in a simple $5 sandwich, you could barely close the pita and it spilled out when I went to eat it in my car. I don't mind a little mess when I'm getting MOAR MEAT!  Nothing fancy, but quick, fast, fresh and tasty. Not much more you can ask for  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Hi, I made an account just to tell you all how much I love ziz greek kitchen! Foods great and the people are awesome (Especially the lady at the cash!). It's wont break the bank but the quality still remains phenomenal! ps..i dont know what Marlow x is saying but I LOVE tzatzki tooo!"}
{"text":"The service was very fast, but my pork souvlaki meal had only very few pieces of meat. Nothing stands out enough about the meal or the place to make me want to go back."}
{"text":"This spot has changed owners and cuisine over the years.  First Italian, then Chinese and currently Greek.  All with the same concept of fast food, choose and pay, and seat yourself.  This latest Greek version has a family run feel and decent quality food.  Service is fast and friendly and with the serving sizes, you'll never leave hungry."}
{"text":"Gyros is very dry and salty on the verge of being jerky. The rice is similarly dry and flavorless.  Portion sizes are also small.  Staff seem to be just going through the motions waiting for the place to shut down.  I remember years ago coming here and it was packed with people and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"2.5 Star  Ziz Greek Kitchen is a decent option if you are working in the area and want a quick lunch.  Everything here is pre cooked and ready to serve so you can get your order ready to go in 5 minute or less. Food court/Cafeteria like set up  Grilled Chicken and Pork ($11.50) were both really dry and bland. The best part of the dinner combo was the potato which has a tangy flavour.  Buy 9 get one free. I don't think I can eat 9 of those..."}
{"text":"Standard fare Greek place.  If you are looking for a quick meal, it's about as casual Greek as you will get.  Cafeterias like service - or call it Hot Table.  Food in warmers on one side + cold salad on the other.  If you've seen one Jimmy the Greek type place...you've seen Ziz.  The food tastes like it should for the 5 minute quick serve model.  Get in, eat, Get out!  Prices are the same as other places.  Expect to pay about $12 + taxes for a \"dinner.\"  Not much more I can say about the place.  If you can afford to smell like garlic back at work, get your Greek on here.  Cheers."}
