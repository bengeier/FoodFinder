{"text":"Excellent pastries, cappuccino and decor. Perfect for a tete-a-tete. Service was courteous and it was lovely to see the kitchen working like a well-oiled machine. Definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Very good food at very good prices.   My wife had the chicken liver mouse which was rich and flavorful.   The roasted cauliflower with pine nuts and raisins had a good combination of textures and flavors.   The tart was yummy.   Service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Incredible. Of all the bakeries/dessert shops i visited (20+), this one most impressed me. Top notch quality. Note, however, they do not have an enormous selection."}
{"text":"I've tastes the Chou à la crème, gâteau au chocolat Saint-Henri, kouig amman, pot de crème au chocolat and brownie and everything is sublime. Service is professional and friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a break and a snack. I love bananas but don't usually like banana desserts but the banana cream was amazing! I would have gotten another one if we hadn't already ordered the last one."}
{"text":"A great place for coffee and sweets of very good quality. The staff is welcoming and on point. Excellent in every way. Prices are reasonable and the desserts are delicious."}
{"text":"Had a few things here but what really stood out for me was \"le vert\". Looked disappointing when it first arrived but that flavour and textures just exploded in your mouth from the very first bite. So much so that I still think about it weeks after. Its absolutely delicious. Its also open late for a bakery so that is a big plus. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the price vs portion size. I thought the price was fine but the portions could be bigger."}
{"text":"Belle découverte. C'est un lieu familiale ou juste pour manger une.patisserie ou un lunch avec un ami. J'ai goûté à deux pâtisseries et c'est magique !!! Le service est rapide et sympathique. Je reviendrai certainement!"}
{"text":"Nous y retournerons, pour les pâtisseries!   Pour les cafés allongés ... Non!  Dommage... Optez pour le thé..."}
{"text":"Great pastry shop by chef Patrice Demers.  I had the chocolate bahibe, banana and caramel chou à la crème, and it's easily one of the best I've had. There's a back room that's nice if you want to study and a modern atmosphere.  I'm looking forward to my next visit to try out some more cakes!"}
{"text":"Eclair au chocolat et banane is one of my FAVORITEs. Blueberry scone is also a must-try item if you look for something to take away on the road.   Should try all the desserts and pastries from the display. Everything made from Chef Patrice is heavenly delicious! Note that at lunch time Wed through Fri, they serve lunch menus with a couple of specialties of desserts."}
{"text":"Love love the open kitchen design and lurking past the window to see the busy bees making delicious pastries!  The lime tart was dreamy: tart, sweet, buttery and crunchy at the same time. That was definitely my favourite!  The St Henri pastry was well executed but I thought the strong flavours of chocolate and coffee were clashing a bit. The kouign amann was too dry and depressing (said my other half) not up to the standard of the kougna man made by the kouigna amann bakery on mont royal avenue.  Very nice quality herbal tea. Modern and cosy atmosphere. I would come back but it would be nice to have a wider choice of patisseries. That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"I had their grilled cheese and espresso, both of which were disappointing (especially compared to what Patrice get me used with his pastry menu). They used some sort of brioche bread without that isn't buttered whatsoever, resulting in a dry and flat sandwich. Considering they charge $10 for that and that Patrice supposedly worked at the \"400 coups\", I can't safely recommend going there for lunch or brunch as there are other options both cheaper and tastier around."}
{"text":"Perfectly buttery and crumbly! One minor imperfection!  Celebrity chef and owner Patrice Demers surely knows how to master pastries! Upon walking into his store on Notre Dame St, walking distance from Atwater Market,  you will be pleasantly welcome with the delicious smell of butter, sugar, and a creative group of chefs. His cafe also offers a delicious but small menu for lunch/brunch. Do keep in mind that the store is closed every Monday and Tuesday.  Most often than not in many other stores the pastries are bright in colour, beautifully decorated, but lack quality and flavour. Rest assure that although the pastries at Patrice are a bit pricier than the average store, you will not regret a single extra penny or calorie. Trust me on this! His staff is always extremely polite, kind and very knowledgeable. Which is a great since you might not even know where to begin or what to buy. If I could, I would buy the entire store but you and I know that wouldn't be a smart choice for my tummy and wallet.   You might be asking yourself, with such positive words why did I only give it four stars? For only one reason. The store always is VERY warm and feels a tad stuffy. Which is not at all an issue if you go in quickly for take-out. However! The few times during the Winter and Summer months the store always felt incredibly hot inside. They do have central AC. It still feels quite warm and uncomfortable. I've looked for windows to open, sadly the windows are not made to be open.   Overall I love the pastries! Also if you are at all familiar with good quality European baking chocolate. Patrice uses Valrhona in all of his pastries and hot cocoa as well. Which is a big plus for me! I will definitely be returning again and again. I just wish the ambiance would feel less stuffy."}
{"text":"I visited this place multiple times when I was in Montreal. We were recommended to this place by a chef at Provisions. Apparently, at the end of the day they take their leftover and donate or give it to the less fortunate people.   My favorite at this place was their Kouign-amann. It tasted AMAZING (maybe cuz we went right when they opened, but I was very happy with it). We tried variety of stuff there, names that I can't remember cuz it was all in French lol.   They have tables there that you can sit down and eat at, but we just ordered it to go. Also, they do brunch on the weekends, which I may try next time i'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Well hellloooooo there, dessert heaven. Why do you always make me want to spend all my money there.   Their strawberry coconut eclair is the bomb!!! Can anything be this perfect? So pretty, but i had to destroy it to eat it. Sigh...   That lemonade...tasted like...shoes....   But let's not talk about that. Let's go back to the desserts. Also tried their brownie, cookie, sablé. So damn good. YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"OMG le chou a la creme was amazing!! Caramel, chocolate and banana cream enclosed by a crispy pastry. Not too sweet, just right. It was a taste of happiness and I am not exaggerating this fact.  The kouign amann was also very tasty, I liked the crispy and sugary skin. (Just found out that they raised price of chou a la creme from $4 to $5 from last year, but it's alright, have to treat yourself once in a while)."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I'm not into sweets.  I came by here to pick up dessert for a family gathering.  I have no idea what kind of dessert I purchased but it was light, not overly sweet, and extremely delicate.  The presentation was beautiful.    I also asked about their specialties and was recommended the kouign amann... that was really good and I tried the two types they had. One plain and the other with poppy seeds and a fruit marmalade inside.    I highly recommend ordering a few days in advance if you know what you want.  However, even though I was in a last minute situation, I was still quite pleased!"}
{"text":"You're probably not going to this beautiful little bakery unless you have a sizable, disposable income (or, okay, you like to occasionally treat yourself) as it's one of the most expensive places I've shopped at all year in Montreal.  That said, the beautiful decor, is second only to the amazing quality of their offerings.  I tried not the lemon tart and their bread, and while the breas was fantastic the lemon tart was honestly the very best baked offering I have ever eaten (and coming from the UK, lord knows I've eaten a lot of them...)  Is it the kind of place I can afford to shop at weekly? Probably not without sacrificing somewhere else, but the quality of that tart is going keep me coming back at least once a month."}
{"text":"Oooh boy avoid at all costs if on some no-carb/no-fun-food-allowed diet plan. The smell of butter alone wafting around is probably enough to fulfill your caloric max for the day!  Seriously though, this patisserie is such a delight. It's sophisticated in both atmosphere and offerings and is a terrific indulgence. Their baked goods are very very rich and they have a hardcore espresso machine.   This is a great place for a casual date that you'd still like to impress or somewhere to pick up some thoughtful and delicious gifts for a host (they come in the coolest packaging). You're also guaranteed great service by very knowledgable staff -a win all around!  A delicious looking brunch is also available on Sundays but I have yet to partake so I can't comment on it. That said, if their baked goods are any indication, it's probably awesome."}
{"text":"Choix limité de pâtisserie (d'où le 3 étoiles). Mais c'est délicieux, vaut le détour. Ca reste un luxe, une pâtisserie à 6$"}
{"text":"As a self proclaimed pastry connoisseur after living in Paris, I am EXTREMELY picky and critical of pastries. My pastry hunts in Toronto have disappointed me time and time again with the exception of Roselle. But I found a little bit of Paris in Montreal, here at Patrice! I am a newly converted lemon tart lover so of course I tried the lemon tart with almond and tarragon. Helloooo Paris! The tart was the perfect texture where it doesn't crumble instantly but also isn't too hard. The lemon curd struck the perfect balance of sweet versus sour and every flavour and texture came together SO well. I regret not trying other things from here because honestly they all looked fantastic, but this will give me something to look forward to for the next time"}
{"text":"Omg, if I could eat everything they make here in 1 shot I would! I had the citrus tart with a hot chocolate, husband had the chocolate banana kouign Aman with a cappuccino and we both devoured our treats. The hot chocolate was actually made from chocolate and not the powdered sugary stuff so it was rich but not too sweet. Loved that you could watch the kitchen staff whipping up some treats. Prices were very reasonable for the quality of food you get. Also took some goodies home to sample, the blueberry scone, an eclair and the caramel Chou de Creme and they were all amazing. Give them a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Location: I guess it's considered Little Burgundy. The closest subway is Lionel-Groulx (orange line) and street parking is available.   The place: Spacious and clean with a simple, elegant decor. I really liked the layout - there's ample space between tables and you don't feel like you're being forced to have dessert with strangers.   The goods: Truth be told, the selection was somewhat limited for a Saturday. I went for the chocolate + café St. Henri cake, which was a cross between cake and mousse. I quite enjoyed this dessert - the mousse was super smooth and silky with the perfect amount of chocolatey flavor. The bottom of the cake was crunchy. What I appreciated most was that it wasn't sickeningly sweet and the portion was perfect - therefore, no difficulty finishing it!  I also tried the home-made Chai latté and it was AMAZING. I think it was the best Chai latté that I've had in Montreal.   Service: Good.   Price point: For dessert and latté, I think it cost me about $10.   While I did enjoy Patrice, I still have a preference for Christian Faure. C-F has a much wider selection of pastries to choose from, and visually, no one in town beats the beauty of his 'designs.' Also, in terms of vibe, it just feels more like a pastry shop that one pops into for a luxurious dessert and coffee."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try this bakery; finally I stepped in to try something.   It has very modern decor inside.   The pastries at the cash counter made me feel that I am at Tate museum in London. The decor and design of the pastries were ridiculously funky. I was having hard time to choose something. Finally, I sat on almond tart with tarragon. Weird? Right? The first bite of that tart made me say... eww... but at the second bite, I said it wasn't that bad. At the third bite and the rest of bites... I said it was good. Drink, a juice of clementine, orange and strawberry... that was good!   The service was good!  Overall, I am not that impressed with this restaurant ... I don't see any thing that makes this bakery unique."}
{"text":"Excellent everything!  Awesome coffee, unbelievable pastries (though I'm not a big fan of banana flavours in pastries), great location (walking distance from the metro or from Atwater market), and a great decor/atmosphere."}
{"text":"It doesn't get better than this for real pastries, limited selection but executed so professionally. Those cholocate eclairs when available are out of this world."}
{"text":"Le choux chantilly au chocolat infusé de café St-Henri nous rassure de sa propension décadente par son fond de banane en compote. Euh... c'est un peu santé. Un bobard que je me convaincrai éventuellement. Feuilleté en bouche sans émiétter au pourtour et avec une touche subtilement salée au creux."}
{"text":"I love this pastry shop.The place is beautiful and minimalistic; good spot to catch up with a friend. I'm so happy and proud that Patrice is a Quebecer and has decided to open his own store in Little Burgundy. Yes, his desserts are pricey but oh so worth it. They're the perfect cheat snacks. From the generous soft cookies filled with chocolate morsels to the must-have Kouign Amann (a very buttery sweet croissant with a perfectly crispy exterior), you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I have been using Yelp for a while now and rarely do review unless it was really bad. I decided to do a little different today and Give a 5 stars to my FAVORITE bakery and breakfast restaurant in Montreal. Its soooo good"}
{"text":"C'est un vrai délice  C'est l'une de mes deux pâtisserie préférée à Montreal où on retrouve de vrais pâtisseries goûteuses et raffinées  Un pur plaisir  À découvrir et recouvrir"}
{"text":"Je suis bien content de voir cette nouveauté dans notre beau quartier!  Comme son nom l'indique, c'est une pâtisserie. Vous pouvez y aller pour... acheter des pâtisseries, mais aussi pour profiter des tables là-bas pour commander quelque chose à manger.  Voici le récit de notre petite excursion à cette pâtisserie !  L'intérieur permet de voir les chefs à l'oeuvre dans la cuisine.  Les pâtisseries que vous trouvez là auront dequoi vous étonnez! Nous avons goûté à différents types de dessert :  Tarte choco-pomme avec noisette (trop bon) Dessert chocolat café Verrine de crème citron avec chantilly Financier à l'érable (OMG)  C'est très bon, les desserts ont plusieurs goûts et sont de tailles parfaites pour remplir, mais pas écoeurer.   En plus, ça vient dans une petite boîte bien belle à montrer à ses invités.  Vous pourrez voir que la sélection n'est peut-être pas vaste, mais la qualité y est. Qui dit qualité, dit aussi prix élevé. Disons que c'est une pâtisserie que je n'irais pas chercher un dessert à 6$ pour tous les jours, mais parfait pour la réception d'amis (que vous aimez).   Thoma."}
{"text":"So I upgraded my stars purely based on ambiance and decor of the venue. It has 4star space, 3 star drinks, and 1.5 star pastries.   Financier, why so oily!? Where are the eggs and things that usually make you a choice dessert?  Kouign Amann, why so dry? What happened to the flaky, buttery layers you should be (at least in the truest form)?  Ahh, after my second encounter with \"top\" pastry shops in the city, I believe that pasties are not the strength of Montreal. And thats okay. It could be the ingredients, the weather, who knows. All I know is that I will stick with fatty foods and bagels next time around.  But the space is incredible and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience (sans pastries) by looking inwards at the beautifully designed space~"}
{"text":"I love the K. Ammans!! Cookies are great! And I love the lemon pannacotta! It is a little bit pricey and the lunch isn't the best it's more knows for its bake goods."}
{"text":"I've never had a better Kouign Amann than the version here. It had all the basics done perfectly: buttery, precisely flaky, and crunchy. But, what separated it from all mortal versions of the pastry was the interior: I felt as if I were eating candy floss (brioche, I know) without the extra sweetness one associates with that treat. Textbook perfect... and, more!  Patrice Patissier is located somewhat far from the popular tourist spots in Montreal, but should be destination dining for anyone who has a sweet tooth - in my case 30 of them ;) They serve lunch during weekdays and brunch on the weekend as well, but the reason to visit should be to try the meticulously crafted pastries from the (former) star pastry chef of the restaurant 400 blows (Les 400 Coups, coincidentally one of my favorite movies of all time), Patrice Demers. The decor of the restaurant/Patisserie stands out from the predominant design and colors for cupcake/dessert shops with its modern almost Scandinavian look accenting polished wood furniture.  It's clear from the pastry selection that he's got a keen sense of textural combinations and interplay of flavors. More than that, he has the vision to reinterpret traditional desserts with modern flair. One such example is the Foret Noire (Black Forest Cake). It's presented as a thin rectangle with a very fudge like base, is layered with cherry gelée and topped with whipped cream and cherry slices. Glorious. Elevating both fudge and Black Forest cake. And, uncommon for Black Forest Cake, extremely light.  Obviously, I wasn't just going to eat one dessert. And, with a dessert so airy, that didn't need to be the case. Next, I tried the Pot Citron, which was perfectly, not excessively, tart paired with some fresh cream and texturally enhanced by the accompanying crumble.  Obviously, I'd intended to take the Kouign Amann to go, but given how light the two desserts had been easily finished it off inside the Patisserie. The experienced and knowledgeable server chuckled when I went back for advice on my to-go item. She pointed to the sablé cookie, another inspired guidance. The sablé cookie features thick and creamy chocolate ganache sandwiched between crisp and sandy cookies, and reflects pure chocolate magic. Yet another exceptionally executed and lbaked good.  So, go ahead and indulge: you can likely burn the calories in a long walk to the Notre-Dame Basilica. If not, be sure that you couldn't do better in terms of the critical quality/calorie ratio."}
{"text":"It was incredible! I search and search for well prepared desserts and can't find anything close to this place in Toronto. There are attempts but not even close. Both the savoury and sweet were well executed with subtle flavours that work well together  The place also had clean modern lines and the staff were very helpful"}
{"text":"Really nice place close to where I live. The kouign amman are delicious and the prices are quite reasonable. The place is cozy and the pastries are always super fresh. i would definitely come back to try more."}
{"text":"High end patisserie with calm interior. Stopped by on my way to pick up my dinner. Wow so glad I checked it out. Everything I tried is so delicious."}
{"text":"Patrice Pâtissier Montreal is located just steps away from Joe Beef and Liverpool House in Little Burgundy. It is a quick subway ride to Station Lionel-Groulx. If you are in the area, do also check out Marche Atwater market. It is a lot like Marches Jean Talon Public Market.   The shop is opened by Pastry Chef Patrice Demers and his fiancée and sommelière Marie-Josée Beaudouin. Patrice Pâtissier offers a variety of delicious eclairs, sables, coffee and will also be serving some savoury treats.   Patrice Pâtissier is a simple modern bakery and coffee shop with high quality pastries. There's a great bar counter to people watch and a workshop in the back. Prices ranges $3 to $6 per piece. Their Americano espresso is strong and earthy.  Choux a la Creme 5.50: A perfection of caramel, chocolate and banana cream crispy pastry. I liked that is was not too sweet. If you are a fan of banana cream, you must stop by Roselle in Toronto King Street East. Their Banana Cream Eclair is filled with a caramelized banana and vanilla bean cream.  Eclair 5.50: These eclair donuts with apricots are light and with a soft crispy crunch."}
{"text":"Everything is so delicious in Patrice! If you buy 6 or more, tax is free! My favorites are the lemon tart, financier, and kouign amann! But honestly there are no wrong choices here!  The pastries are so delicious because they are wonderfully rich, and often a slightly different take on flavor so that there's a bit of surprise in each!"}
{"text":"Patrice is honestly the cream of the crop. I don't think there's any pastries out there that can compare which is a lot coming from such a culinary diverse city ! The day I discovered Patrice I went back 3 times that week ! His desserts are quite straight forward but the quality of ingredients  and technique that he uses make his dessert quite sophisticated ! I'd want my wedding cake and all of my friends wedding cake from this place ! It sucks that this place doesn't open later !"}
{"text":"Yah, I see the logic behind all these 5 stars and I can't help but agree. I met the kind and elegant Candice here for a Yelp friend hang, and I think we both relaxed immediately from busy bustling days as we eased into this bright  tasteful room. The kouin amman was dreamy, the little maple loaf was buttery with a crispy crust, and the cheesecake mouse was so light and magical - it had a layer of apple or something jellied in the middle that brought a weird and unnecessary texture to the treat but honestly I can't complain about it, it was delicious and I would eat it any time regardless of weird apply jellied thingers in the middle.   Also of note: a back room with big shared tables where I think the magic happens but also there are books and it seemed open for groups? And also also, an elegant bar with a small but lovely looking collection of wines and some spirits too I thought? Drinks and dessert is a lovely idea, don't mind if a I do."}
{"text":"Very modern and upscale looking dessert house with amazing pastries. We got three desserts to share and two of them made me scream OMG inside. The attention to detail, combination of flavours and the right amount of sweetness definitely make me want to come back for more."}
{"text":"La réputAtion de Patrice n'est plus à faire. Tous les desserts sont bien exécutés mais je ne sais trop pourquoi, ça ne clique pas avec cet endroit. L'ambiance que j'y retrouve n'est pas celle que je recherche quand je vais déguster un plaisir sucré. C'est \"froid\" et sombre dans le local alors qu'il semble agréable de travailler dans la production ou la salle de démo qui sont plus chaleureuses. Côté dessert: le cannelé était bon, le vert intéressant, le forêt noir moins mon type mais bien aussi. C'est endroit je le conseille davantage pour les cours ou pour prendre quelque chose pour apporter."}
{"text":"TLDR: Delightful sweets and great drinks at a sophisticated patisserie.  I ordered the chai latte, which was light and warmed me right up. The same can be said for the cafe au lait. I ordered the almond brioche which was out of this world. At first, we thought it was simply well-toasted brioche with broiled marzipan as we bit into the corners. But once we got into the center there was this amazing almond deliciousness.  The servers were very friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend if you need a sweet fix.  They also give classes which look quite enjoyable."}
{"text":"Simply adorable! Finally this neighbourhood has a high quality pastry shop. One would never guess from outside what a relief and sweet happiness is waiting for you in the bakery. First sign of freshness is the decor and space utilization, modern and simple. The bar counter overlooking the kitchen is a great place to sit and watch through the window what is happening inside. The second sign of freshness are the amazing flavours of just baked pastries.   The Kouign Amannn is absolutely my preferred version of the famous Breton pastry, lighter, flaky and crispy on top. I also liked very much the chocolate and coffee St Henri cake, not too sweet, smooth and balanced dessert. Sometime you can discover small surprises as the chestnut pastry I had last week. It is true the selection is not huge, but everything I have savoured was perfect and delicious. I'm not a big fan of their espresso, but the coffee with milk is good alternative and they have nice selection of tea.   Patrice Patissier is definitely a place for regular visits and little sweet treats."}
{"text":"I have been to Patrick a few times already but I never stay there to eat, I always take some patisserie to go. I really like the fact that his patisserie change with the season and what is available. Sometime the flavours are weird (mushrooms, etc.) but most of the times it's really tasty. My favorite is the Citrus curd/posset-filled tartelette topped with a quenelle of vanilla chantilly, it's to die for.  Maybe next time I will try their brunch menu."}
{"text":"Too bad my friend and I found this place the day before we had to fly back home. And wow, I just loved it! Atmosphere is nice, coffee was good and pastries were amazing! I had to go back the next day before we flew out. I think I tried half of their pastries. Lol. will def go back if I ever get to visit Montreal again."}
{"text":"Don't you just love walking into a bakery and being greeted by mind blowingly good aromas?  Don't you love it even more when those smells translate into delicious baked goods.  That basically sums up a visit to Patrice Patissier.  There are so many yummy treats on display that narrowing down your choices is no easy task.  Ultimately though I went with the kouign amann which had a sweet, crispy exterior and an airy, buttery interior.    The bakery is huge and even includes an area for cooking classes (which are already full for the spring sigh).  There's ample seating and it's definitely worth while staying to enjoy your goodies here.   I will definitely be returning here when I'm in the Atwater Market area."}
{"text":"Incredible pastries and great coffee. We stopped by here during the week around lunch for a quick treat - the place was busy but no line up or anything. No one came to speak with us for at least 5 minutes.. We stood by the door watching servers fly by with delicious looking creations and no one acknowledged us standing there. We were a bit upset and surprised.. This place has reputation of being one of the best patissieres and the service really sucked! Finally we were seated and still, the service sucked. Maybe our server was uncomfortable in English, however half our group spoke perfect French. She was very cold and unhelpful. On the upside now... WONDERFUL pastries. We got about 6 to share as a group and none disappointed. Flaky, sweet, beautiful textures. All in all, fantastic. Patrice Demers is a genius! Love the look of the place.. Open kitchen is a great touch. Will definitely go back for the food... Hope we have a better experience with the service."}
{"text":"Je mange le chou à la crème de Chez Patrice à chaque semaine depuis que je l'ai découvert. C'est sans équivoque mon dessert préféré - point à la ligne.  Les autres pâtisseries chez Patrice sont apparemment très bonnes, c'est du moins ce que disent ma famille. Mais je ne saurai pas - je suis loyal au chou à la crème, et je n'ai pas l'intention de manger autre chose."}
{"text":"Professional, tasty, beautiful decor. Warm, inviting. Good music selection.   The desserts we had were fabulous, a true masters work! Flavor combinations were surprising and fresh.   Plating was beautiful, cutlery was nice. I have a soft spot for Duralex glasses. Big win!  Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Ayant entendu parler de cette place depuis longtemps, j'ai finalement succombé. Voilà maintenant, c'est important de le mentionné, c'est une pâtisserie et non une boulangerie, donc si vous venez déjeuner ici, n'attendez vous pas à voir des croissants ou chocolatines, mais plutôt des scones ou kouign aman, au moins y'a des bons lattés. L'endroit est bien aménagé et on peut voir les pâtissiers à l'oeuvre."}
{"text":"Absolutely decadent pastries! Each one is like a work of art! The custard is delicious and the cookie/biscuit is top notch! The staff is really sweet and is an open, clean space to indulge yourself in a cool pet of town"}
{"text":"Patrice Patissier is exactly what I've always wanted from a pastry shop. Treading the fine line between rustic and modern, mostly wood with big windows and beautiful touches everywhere, it's as calming an environment as any spa - we're just missing the sound of a gentle waterfall.  All this before I even got my coffee, which was just perfect, with a good hit of acidity but no trace of bitterness, and didn't need a drop of sugar. My sweet tooth got its fix from a crunchy/soft kouign-amann, which rivals the one from the Mont Royal bakery that specializes in this pastry. My husband had a Croque Monsieur oozing with Gruyere and the most delicious ham on Hof Kelsten bread... Seriously... Patrice knows what's up.   They even have a bright, warm, open kitchen space just past the dining room where they give pastry lessons, and if you're going to take lessons from anyone, you'd be hard pressed to find people who know pastry better than these guys.  Just... Wow.  Oh, and not that it matters much, because with this much goodness I would literally have paid almost anything... But the prices are totally reasonable."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  Dishes ordered: Strawberry Cheesecake, Rhubarb Tart, Kouign Amann  Amazing: Strawberry Cheesecake: Clean and not overly sweet. Chamomile flowers on top add a great floral tone that accentuates the entire dessert.  Standard: Rhubarb Tart: Good balance between tarty, sweet, and slightly bitter. Wish the lemon tart was available.  Kouign Amann: Pretty standard.  Bad: None."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me knows that I love sweets. And frankly, when it comes to sweets right now in Montreal, there is no better area than the Sud-Ouest. Already home to Leche Desserts and Rustique (my favorite doughnut and pie shops), it is only perfect that Patrice Demers, formally of Les 400 Coups in the old port, decided to set up his new venture, Patrice Patissier, in the area as well. His boutique opened up about 3 weeks ago now and I went on the opening weekend to see what he had in store.  Having taking over the old video rental store on Notre-Dame Ouest just down the block from the Joe Beef empire, the space is divided into a takeout bakery, a wine bar/seating space and a back room for eventual cooking classes. The kitchen is visible to all when you walk in, allowing us to see what comes on behind the scenes. The space is modern, clean and relaxed - touches of wood and nice lighting makes the room inviting to sit and grab a quick tea (or coffee for those of you are inclined to such a beverage).  Now, for this first visit, I stuck to the bakery because that was my main interest and also because it was the only part of the boutique open at that point. Patrice Patissier offers quite an assortment of items -  pastries, cakes, \"petit pots\" and cream puffs. I had a dinner in the evening and was responsible for the dessert portion of our meal - I figured a nice variety of everything they had at that moment would be appropriate. Ironically enough, at the time I arrived that early afternoon, there wasn't all that much left as clearly their opening weekend was going better than they had planned. Great for them, not so much for us as patrons but hey, it just means I would need to come back to try what I missed out on.  On the pastry front, I got their Kouign Amann and a maple Financier. Now I had never heard of a Kouign Amann before this - it is a Breton cake, kind of a sweetened puff pastry. Sweet and flaky, this was a nice new discovery. The maple financier was great as well - a moist banana bread or sponge cake-like consistency with the added sweetness of maple syrup.  The one cake they had left was a chocolate and cafe St-Henri cake. A deliciously chocolatey treat with just a slight hint of coffee which, for me, as a coffee hater, is a good thing.  Both varieties of their \"petit pots\" were available - lemon, camomille, Anicet honey and yogourt, pineapple, muesli. Both are served in actual mini pots to take home. In both cases, great combinations of flavour and texture. The sweet pineapple, the fresh yogourt and the crunch of the granola or the bite of the lemon with the sweetness of honey and the spongy meringues - I really enjoyed these. The presentation as well is a nice creative touch from Patrice and his team.  The final dessert was their cream puff which is done to order. The day I was there the cream filling was Bahibe chocolate, caramel and banana. A great combination of bitterness and sweetness in a wonderfully rich cream filling. Top notch dessert and probably the biggest hit amongst my dining group that evening.  As a first impression, Patrice Patissier hit some very strong notes. All of the desserts were wonderful - not a single dud in the bunch. Once the wine bar aspect of the space gets really going, I will definitely be checking it out. Now my biggest challenge dessert-wise here is not coming home with a dozen different pastries next time I stop by and believe me, I will definitely be stopping by again and you believe you should do the same.

{"text":"Lovely venue. Pretty good food. Interestingly, I prefer their savoury dishes to their pastries and coffee. The latter are fine but the former are close to excellent for brunch or lunch. I particularly like their mushroom-egg dish (I hope it's a permanent menu item). Prices are reasonable, though not a great deal by any measure, and portions are on the small side (which I view as a good thing)."}
{"text":"Les plats salés du soir sont bons, mais les desserts sont définitivement créatifs et très bons... Ils méritent le déplacement si vous voulez vous payer la traite."}
