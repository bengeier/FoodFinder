{"text":"I've driven by this place hundreds of times over the years, not realizing they sold samosas inside, because their windows are covered by posters.  But found them on google a while ago, and finally stopped by to try their 3/$1 vegetable samosas.  They seem to have two different recipes, so sometimes they're different from day to day - the ones with the thin wrapping shown in the picture below I like more than the ones from Samosa King, Canbe Foods, and Babu, because they don't have as strong a flavour.  The ones with the thicker dough do have a bit of a stronger flavour.

They had a lot of other savoury snacks that seemed to be very affordable as well, along with rice and chicken.  It can get busy, but the service is fast.

The samosas with the thinner wrapping are worth a try, for anyone who's looking for some cheap snacks, who's maybe never noticed this place before - they were delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is my go-to for cheap Sri Lankan/Indian takeout. Dine-in is not an option here. I'm actually surprised that this place doesn't have more reviews because it's always busy. The line moves pretty quickly though. Some food are made to order so it can take about 15 mins or so. I've tried quite a few things on their menu. Kothu roti and Masala dosa is my usual order. 

Kothu roti: The best I've ever had! Definitely get mild to start. I made the mistake of getting spicy the first time and even though it was killing my stomach, I couldn't stop eating because it was that good! I looked like a crazy mess eating it. My favorite is the mutton and next would be chili chicken. Also get extra lime or go home and squeeze your own. The lime really brings out and brightens the flavor. 

Masala dosa: There are two sizes. I always get the large. It's so huge that I break it into two meals. Comes with sambar and coconut chutney. Sambar is meh here. The coconut chutney is good. Sometimes they overcook this but it's still pretty darn good."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place through a colleague.

I'm pretty Canadian when it comes to my taste in food but I've fallen in love with Nantha's. Specifically the Mutton Kothu Roti (spicy). They make orders fresh, except for appetizers which they keep under heat lamps. The Mutton Kothu Roti is very easy to eat, no fat on the meat and packed to the rim. The samosas here are smaller than typical Indian samosas, which I really enjoy, they go well as finger snacks. 

$7 Kothu roti
3 for $1 Samosas

No tax!"}
{"text":"Went here by recommendation of a coworker and it has become my favourite to go place for samosas and mutton Biryani! Great flavours and prices. Samosas are 3 for $1 (thicker pastry) or 5 small ones for $1. I prefer the larger size samosa as I think the filling tastes better. Staff are friendly and helpful too :) great gem!"}
{"text":"My favourite Sri Lankan takeout place as you can't go wrong with any of their items.  Go here weekly for Roti and string hoppers.  Their appam, dosai, and pittu are also very good compared to other Sri Lankan takeout joints."}
{"text":"This is where I go when I'm craving some rolls or biriyani. The prices are decent and standard compared to other Sri Lankan caters. Off the top of my head, 3/$1 samosas, $1 mutton/veggie rolls, $6 for a tub of kotu roti. 

It's usually always busy, but the line moves fast. You have to call in ahead of time if you want a large order. The parking lot is at an angle so its kind of hard to get to sometime.

The people in front are billingual in english and tamil and are very knowledgable in the ingredients to help you out if you have doubts. 

I wouldn't recommend using your debit card with them, there have been rumors of them taking costs twice."}
{"text":"Nestled in the corner of what I call the \"Octopus\" plaza, Nantha Caters is super value + very spicy Sri Lankan and South Asian food. This has a family run vibe, but obviously they have another location along Finch/Warden as well.

What I Got: kothu roti, mutton special
What I'd Get Next: mutton rolls, and more kothu roti.

As the name implies, their focus is on the catering part of the business; dine-in is extremely limited, and from what I see, virtually everyone gets takeout. They have a few ladies wandering in and out taking people's orders and part of me always worried they would mix up or forget my order since I don't think anyone actually writes your order down... and lineups can be pretty long during peak hours. Don't come hungry. 

But don't come full, either, because holy moly this will fill you. If you ever wanted to see a dish that I'm NOT CONFIDENT to consistently finish and still feel good about playing sports after... Here.

Get the mutton special kothu roti and LOOK AT THAT SUCKER. It is LOADED. It has one of the highest food to air ratios in a takeout container ever and sometimes I wonder how they even fit everything in.

I always get mild here and the problem is their \"mild\" feels like a slow burn of taste bud scorching. Or maybe I'm just soft.

But the generosity of meat, portion size and value keeps me coming back.

It's not the healthiest, cleanest option, but goodness you will not be hungry after."}
{"text":"Amazing mutton rolls for only $1! Shorteats like samosas, vadei and cutlets are all 3 for $1 and well worth the price. 

Friday rice and curry special has been a staple in my families diet for years. Every Friday for a $5 lunch you get a box of rice with 5 currys that can feed 3 people with rice to spare. 

Definitely one of my favourite Sri Lankan takeout spots! Highly recommend if you're looking for cheap food that tastes amazing!"}
{"text":"Have been getting takeout once every few months when passing by...There are better options at other holes in Scarborough...

If you go in too early, the food tends to be leftovers from the previous night, and it'll rot even before you reach home...

That being said, the food is usually cheap and quality isn't very bad...

The food is either fridge cold or room temperature, and it's not really meant to be eaten any later than a few hours, but has to be microwaved before consumption...

While some servers just top up the boxes, others will load the box to the brink of breaking...

Beware of the Rotis and Naans, as they're usually cooked beforehand...

The worst options:
1) Noodles/Chowmein
2) Roti/Naan
3) Fried Rice

The curries are a decent option and the vegetarian options are good too...

It's a too shabby of a place, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy food here..."}
{"text":"The most reasonably priced south indian food you can find! I love getting their springs rolls and mini dosas."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good and well-priced, although most of it was served to me at room temperature or straight out of the fridge. All of it tasted much better the next day when I heated it up in the microwave."}
{"text":"The food tasted good however I have a big concern that they must have added a lot of soda in the idlis because I got so full with just 2 idlis that wanted to throw up. A good tasting food shouldn't cause such discomfort after consumed. Hope this changes very soon"}
{"text":"This takeout restaurant is pretty convenient and food is for the most part very consistent and delicious. Their mutton rolls are to die for! 

But a few weeks back I went in like usual and there was a line up of POC and the server and line of people spoke their own language. I was the only Chinese Asian but that wasn't anything new when I frequent at this place. However, they had fresh mutton rolls and samosas in the back while none in the display area. The server gladly went to get some for the people in front of me yet when it came to my turn, she said she had none. So then I thought, maybe the people in front of me took the last of it. So I ordered their noodles and she went in to get it rather than scooping the batch in the display. Odd. That's never happened to me before. But I shrugged it off and paid for my food and left. Then a min later, I went back in to get a fork because I forgot and I see her giving mutton rolls to the Indian man who was behind me in the line up! What?? not sure if it's racism but I'm calling it racism haha. I left smelling and yearning for my beloved mutton rolls and a growling stomach. 

Then I arrive at home to take the noodles to eat with my family...but the noodles were bad! There was an expired stench, which is the first I've ever experienced. This place was the place where it sat fondly in my heart, but this encounter had me lowering the 5 to 4 stars. Next time, I hope I can get the rolls"}
