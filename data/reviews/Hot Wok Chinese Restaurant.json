{"text":"We started with the Spring Rolls which were crispy, and not overly oily like these deep fried goodies can sometimes be.  For the main course, we ordered 2 small dishes - Beef with Broccoli and Garlic Chicken.  It was the perfect amount of food for 2 people.  The Beef with Broccoli was probably close to half beef, half broccoli, so that was good.  The Garlic Chicken had a little spice to it which was tasty, though I really couldn't distinguish any garlic flavor.  The restaurant does have a few tables, so you could eat in, but it seems like it's really more set up to be a take-out joint.  I need to try the won ton soup and Mongolian beef before I can give a better or worse rating.  For now \"A-OK\" is a good description."}
{"text":"I really liked the food I had egg foo yong and it was a very generous portion and very tasty. The staff Amy was very friendly and accommodating. I ate in and the place was very busy and you could tell they had a lot of repeat customers. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you want some American-Chinese food this place is great. They'll adjust the recipes to suit your preference. The prices are very reasonable and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Placed an order on line.  45 minutes later I called to see if my food was even on its way.  The girl that answered the phone told me that it was not even made yet.  Then she proceeds to tell me that it will take a long time to get there since we live so far away (Riggs and Gilbert Rd) and that it is Saturday and rush hour so it would take even longer.  I asked her why 45 minutes had gone by and they had not even started on my order.  She said, \"oh, your order is done.\"  So my order was done?  After she told me that it wasn't.  She then asked me, \"Well do you want it or want to cancel?  The driver is standing there waiting to know if you want it or not.\"  I said well send it then if it is done.  After waiting another 30 minutes, I called back.  The asian man on the phone asked who I was and then started screaming at me, \"Well cancel the order.  Well cancel the order\" after I asked where my food was at.  No apologies or anything.  Customer service is horrible.  Management is horrible.  If they can't handle a delivery radius that far, then they need to be BETTER managers and learn how to manage their restaurant by shortening it.  I would never recommend this place after how they treated me.  Plus, the place looks like a roach infested dump!  Time to clean and update it!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Big portion. I got their Chow Fun and it's probably the best I've had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Being new in town this place was the jackpot. Tried them from flyer on door. Great menu selection. Delivery took a bit but in fairness it was Sat nite at dinner time. Food was well worth the wait. Walnut shrimp was best I've had. Good portion size and shrimp was cooked perfectly. Staff taking my order was friendly and professional. Delivery guy was great as well."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim because I wasn't feeling too well and wanted sizzling rice soup.  Even though it's not on the menu, I was told \"no problem, we can make that!\" My stomach felt very grateful! My son ordered the mongolian beef. I ended up ordering a family meal to go as well. Food is great, tasty, not greasy, and not swimming in too much sauce! But the service and attitude is why I will be back, often!"}
{"text":"We have only ever ordered this for take-out, and overall it's pretty good.  The part I absolutely love is the fact that you can order online. They have always got our order correct, despite the fact that I always fill up with \"Notes\" section with my extra requests.  The delivery people have been friendly and quick.    As far as the food, it is definitely not my favorite Chinese ever, however, the flavors are decent and they give you a pretty fair portion.  We always go with the General Tso's chicken, Lo Mein, and Dumplings.  Go with fried dumplings, as opposed to the steamed (they're always kind of flimsy).  Lo Mein is normally pretty good.  The ease of online ordering and the fact that overall it's been good is what keeps us still eating Hot Wok."}
{"text":"This place has good food for the price but the reason for the two stars is how cheap the lady and man is when it comes to giving out sauces.  I went one night ordered a bunch of togo and signed the receipt.  I asked for 4 chili oil and the lady misread my handwriting and asked me what the number was, after I told her she must have not been happy with the tip so she went back and grabbed two sauces and said we usually only give two out.  This isn't the first time they are stingy with it. Not sure if I will go back"}
{"text":"Absolutely great service and food!!! I ordered a bit late last evening for delivery and Amy was incredibly gracious and kind. The person who delivered the food was also very kind and sweet. She delivered in the time that was quoted over the phone and even with a few extra perks free of charge. The food was great - very flavorful and hot! We'll definitely order from Hot Wok again! Thank you so much to the staff for your excellent service all around. :) It really made my family's night...thank you again!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place the owners are very welcoming and the service is great too. I come to this place because its right down the street from where I live and I must say the food here is good. I order the hot and sour soup all the time and it reminds me of back home in NJ. Some off the Chinese restaurants around are not as fresh and they give me the cramps, this place doesn't make you feel like that at all because their food is fresh."}
{"text":"have ordered from here a lot and tonight tried to order something different a kids meal and got told we are busy and not doing any substitutions. Way to be rude to customers, i took my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is great! Here visiting from Seattle needed a quick lunch to go and stopped in by pure chance. What luck!  Got the Chow Fun (wide flat rice noodles saut√©ed with veggies) with prawns and veg. fried rice. Delicious. Also got a quart of hot and sour soup. Very good. You'd be surprised how bad this simple soup can be at different places. We got pot stickers as well. These could definitely be better, not bad for sure just lacking. I enjoyed the food so much I went back two days later. This time I got the Chicken Chop Suey (ck. breast, bean sprouts, celery, and onions). Very good. Another simple dish done well. Finally the real reason I'm writing this review. THE EGGPLANT IN GARLIC SAUCE!  FANTASTIC! Seriously you normally need to be in/near Chinatown to get food this good! OMG! SO GOOD! If you dig eggplant YOU MUST TRY! If I lived here I'd in weekly just for this dish!  NO JOKE. Great food, nice clean dining room perfect for a date, reasonable prices very good customer service (although not terribly busy when I dined in) and good portions! Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it's definitely my favorite Chinese Take-Out/Delivery restaurant. I've never had any issues with ordering online, calling in or dining.  I really like the online ordering option.   Portions are great, huge in fact. I have a food allergy, and every time I mention it in the comments section my order comes perfectly. Also I can leave a comment that I have a coupon and get the crab puffs free.   Ohhh Myyyy!!! The crab puffs are heavenly, absolutely incredible!  I read a few of the reviews, someone said it was too greasy, I've never had that experience. Last time I ordered my Sweet & Sour Chicken was a bit dry, that was a surprise because normally it is tender and moist. Every establishment has an off day, so it's nothing that would keep me from going back.  When I dine in they are always very nice and accommodating, I'm a picky eater so I often special order. They don't make me feel like this is an issue at all. They even remember how I like things. :-)"}
{"text":"We're regulars at least once or twice a month for the delivery family special. You get a ton of food. Says feeds 4-6. We're a family of five and we always have left overs the next day. Its traditional Chinese food, nothing fancy, but pretty good none the less. They always get our order correct when I place it online and I usually switch up my order at no additional cost unless I replace an item with a more expensive item. I recommend this place for large family meals. Can't go wrong for under 40$"}
{"text":"Food is really good, just if you order for delivery expect it to take more than 30 mins."}
{"text":"This place is great, wonderful service, amazing food and the prices you just can't beat. Food is clean and healthy not oily or heavy at all. Overall  just great"}
{"text":"Whatever you think you may know about great service, staff and even better food, you don't know s*** until you try this place. Hands down the best Chinese food, best prices and best service. STFU and try them out."}
{"text":"Usually pretty good but quality seems to be not what it once was. Ordered the sweet and sour chicken and it was very bland overlooked."}
{"text":"I caught an advertiser posting a menu on my door this afternoon for Hot Wok Feng. I told him it says no soliciting and to take the menu off the door and he said no. I had to take it off my door myself and it had tape residue and some of the paint from the door peeled off. I should really sue Hot Wok Feng for property damage (but I won't since I am a nice guy!). DONT GO HERE, THEY WONT LISTEN TO YOUR INSTRUCTIONS JUST LIKE THIS GUY DIDN'T!"}
{"text":"I am from out of town and was looking for some good Chinese.  I found them online and placed an order.  Seeing that they had online ordering I liked the convenience and was happy they had it.  Upon driving to pick up my order, they never \"got it\" even though I got a confirmation email.  They were pretty flippant about it and didnt see it as a big deal, saying that it happens \"alot\"  I will not be dining at this place anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, food was cold by the time it got to my house, kung po chicked had nothing but vegetables, rice was dry. would not recommend"}
{"text":"We were already fans of Hot Wok Feng with their great food and friendly staff. They have recently expanded and remodeled. It looks amazing and still the same great food and staff! Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"The curb appeal is lacking, but the food is excellent! Not only that, but the food comes out looking just like the pictures. I'm glad we decided to give it a try. We ordered the dumplings and Shrimp Chow Fun which got everyone's approval. So of course we had to go back two days later and try the Chicken Chop Suey, and Eggplant w/garlic sauce. So. Good! That might even be the best Eggplant w/garlic sauce that I've had.  So yes, amazing diamond in the rough and y'all should try it!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from them because they're open late and were decently priced. However, I have ordered from them twice now and it will be my last time. The sweet and sour sauce tastes like candy mixed with tamarind. The friend rice tastes like overpoweringly like soy sauce and their beef is chewy at best. Maybe they'd be better in person but the food that was delivered was very sub-par and I feel I wasted my money. Besides that, they promised me delivery in 20 minutes and after calling back 3 times they finally got to my house almost an hour and a half later without even an apology."}
{"text":"I love this place. The online ordering function is great. Our food has always arrived fast and delicious. The staff is very courteous."}
{"text":"We were faithful patrons until we found a pubic hair in the rice! I've told everyone I know be aware!! Super bummed that my favorite Chinese place let me down!"}
{"text":"The wife and I are big fans. We're from New York and decent Chinese food is hard to come by in AZ.  This place works for us. It's a small take out place but we like to eat there. Alex and Amy make it comfortable and friendly. Garlic eggplant was a score."}
{"text":"Just very average food. Fairly bland.  Needs something... perhaps more garlic, onion and other items that would give the food more flavor.  Honestly, I've had frozen dinners that had more flavor.  Once was enough for me here."}
{"text":"Amazing! It is so hard to find a good Chinese restaurant. We have been here/ordered from Hot Wok 3 times in the past 6 months and it has always been on point, even when I have special requests. Hot, fresh and always tastes wonderful:) from their Pad Thai, to spring rolls, Kung Pao, orange chicken, walnut shrimp and beyond! Fast service dine in and delivery... amazing!"}
{"text":"Very extensive menu, great lunch specials and outstanding happy hour prices. Servers were also very attentive."}
{"text":"Place seems to be going downhill. It is close to my house and next to my Safeway so our girls like it from time to time. Food has become somewhat greasy and the interior is cluttered.    The owners need to take a close look at this place through a customer's eye. I think they might not like what they see!  In need of cleaning the place up and getting back to preparing the food the way they used to."}
{"text":"If you're looking for affordable but tasty Chinese, delivered to your house QUICK, then give them a try. Don't expect 5 star dining, they're not that place. And that's fine. For what it is, it's great. We've been ordering from here for a few years and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Yummy and fresh and special made to order! Perfect every time and I've been eating here for 6 years!"}
{"text":"I love this place. My whole family loves this place. When we dine in, the service is really great and the food comes out quickly. The staff is so nice, and they always make sure that everything is to our liking.  I've also placed online orders for carry out, and they're always ready when promised. And, for the first time, I placed a delivery order tonight. The order came much faster than we could have expected, despite the extremely bad weather. (My sister and I felt bad even asking anyone to drive in these crummy conditions..but we were really craving some delicous hot wok.) The driver was so nice that he refused to let me tip him too much despite wanting to make up for the weather, and was just really polite and pleasant. Pretty much everything you could ask for in a delivery experience.  This is my go to for Chinese food now. The prices are super reasonable, the portions are great, and the quality of the food is just perfect. There's nothing more disappointing than a soggy egg roll, bland chicken or bad crab puffs. But hot wok does it just right every time..perfectly saucy, perfectly crispy, and always tasty. That plus the lovely employees = my favorite. Thanks for the great service, hot wok! You guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"I have always loved this place. Being able to order online is great and deliveries have always shown up within a half hour. The pork fried rice is good. You can order mild, medium or spicy for the heated dishes. It's been my $30 habit to treat my boyfriend and I every other month (or twice a month).   However, last week my order showed up 1 AND A HALF HOURS AFTER I ORDERED IT. The spare ribs were tough. The egg rolls very tough and chewy and pulled when you bit in and the centers lukewarm. The pad thai was ordered mild and it showed up very unevenly spiced with the shrimp and some of the pasta noticeably over-spiced for MILD.   This was my comfort food. The impression is now ruined.  four or five stars downgraded to 3. It's ok.  I need to look at other places in the area."}
{"text":"We have always been more than satisfied. We've never eaten in the restaurant but order delivery regularly. The food comes hot and well packed. Never disappointed. Try the lettuce wraps and hot and sour soup. YUM!"}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese cuisine AND atmosphere. The staff is very friendly and honest. They took great care of us! The food was not only delicious, it was presentable. The egg rolls were sliced and fashioned criss-cross, the general tso's shrimp laid above a bed of broccoli, and the wonton soup was filled so high we couldn't finish it. This place is 6/5 stars."}
{"text":"The employees are super kind, the food tastes amazing. Some of the best crab puffs I've had in a really long time! The lunch and dinner specials are really yummy and super affordable. I also think their Thai Tea is fantastic! 10/10 would recommend!!! :)"}
{"text":"Great food, but what makes me give them a 5 star is the service. I've been here numerous times and it's the same courteous demeanor and welcoming experience."}
{"text":"This place has a good selection to choose from, and the portions are just perfect! You can order online BUT. It takes forever to get to my house. The food is so delicious though! Just wish it wouldn't take over an hour to arrive!"}
{"text":"Thi tea with boba - boba was hot and mushy Ordered waited... waited .... waited....  food goes out to a table that came about 10 mins after us.    She comes by asks what we ordered told her, another lady comes by Asks if we  we ordered right now. Confused.  Puts two sad salads down on the table and says salad on the house. . Haha uh okay.  Waiting waiting waiting. 30 mins for food. When there was 2 tables here.  Already eating. .   But the actual food was good. So just take it with a grain of salt.  Friendly staff. :)"}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant is bad and the management doesn't seem to be very \"customer friendly\". If management from Hot Wok replies to this posting I'm sure they will say they were nothing but friendly and understanding but that definitely is not the case. They basically lost my business because I was charged for an order that took an hour and forty five minutes to receive (They kept me waiting for their food and then charged me because I \"accepted\" it when it came to my door, even though we were just told on the phone it would be free). I guess they wanted to take the food back and deliver it to someone else? Used to like ordering from here but there are cheaper and better alternatives! Also places that don't hang up on you. Obviously they are gutting busier and just not caring about their customers anymore."}
{"text":"I'm Chinese and when I miss my grandmas cooking I go straight to this place. It's the most authentic Chinese food you can get in Chandler!"}
{"text":"I was not a fan of the takeout. The breading is soggy and falls from the meat. The soup was good (hot sour), but everything else we had was not good enough for me to go back. Perhaps if you stay there it would be better. But for takeout I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"OH My God! I have been coming here for 5 years, tonight was just awful. The food was partially cold, the portions were smaller. And the serving bowl my food came in!!! After I finished eating I showed the chipped ceramic bowl to the waitress...she said \"I know.\"..DAMN! I wont.be coming back"}
{"text":"Placed an order online two hours ago, received an email confirmation and we haven't received any food. No answers to their phone when we try calling. Something seems fishy and weird about this place. I won't be trying them again.   Update: I went to the restaurant to see about my order (before closing time) and they are completely closed. Guess that order isn't coming."}
{"text":"Always great service, excellent tasting food, great value.. this is our go to place for Chinese take out"}
{"text":"Ordered three lunch specials for pickup! Each lunch special is about $7 and it includes your entree, your choice of white rice or fried rice, and either an egg roll or a crab puff!   I had the chicken with string beans, white rice, and an egg roll. The chicken and string beans were VERY GOOD, and the egg roll with the sauce were to die for!   The food was prepared in a timely manner and the staff was friendly. Definitely give this place a try! The food is good!"}
{"text":"Tonight was terrible food. My lemon chicken was so thin and crispy. Dry. My husband food  not good as well. Won ton tasted sweet. That's not how they supposed to be. His egg rolls looks like it old cabbage in it. Not fresh at all. Probably left over from lunch and refried again. Waitress didn't even acknowledge that fact that we left just about all food on our plate and no doggie bag. She didn't care. Haven't been there since they expanded. Good then. We paid. got in our car and went to go eat elsewhere. Not going back. Red dragon on alma school is great! But if you entertainment with some great food. Go to singing panda on chandler Blvd. they are close on Monday is why we came to hot wok."}
{"text":"Food had no flavor at all and the fried rice was mushy. Tossed the food and delivery menu! :("}
{"text":"Beijing Beef is to die for. Great family run business. Support Local Businesses. They have an amazing happy hour $.99 domestic beers. Yes please. I say come check it out."}
{"text":"Okay so I love Chinese food. In fact I've never had Chinese food that I didn't like. Until today that is. Delivery time was fine, a little long but I don't tend to get upset over things like that. The food however is a different story. The lo mein smelled like sewage. Literally. And I know sometimes food can smell bad but taste good so I gave it a shot. Yeah no. It was so disgusting. The egg drop soup tasted like the eggs were rotten. The steamed dumplings were bland and fell apart. The chicken teriyaki was okay but really chewy. I paid $30 and feel like I got totally screwed. So much so that I made a Yelp account just so I could write this.  I'm just so grossed out right now."}
{"text":"Thought it was decent. People are nice. We had the problem of not receiving cashew chicken when we ordered it. Got takeout and then had to call because the meal was not cashew chicken. When I asked to deliver new cashew chicken, they brought to the house literally 15 cashews in a cup. Yes you read that right. Funny at the time but no clue on customer service. Just remake the meal! I didn't want to make a scene with my family so just smiled and closed the door.   Thought this was an undercut from the owner that they didn't even recognize this type of service is not appropriate. This place has been the brunt of numerous jokes this week behind their back. I'm willing to try it again but the owner really needs to reach out to us on that one.   Wow-"}
{"text":"I would never use this business. The hours that they advertise are completely false. If you'd like to get an order for delivery even an hour before they close, they apparently can't provide a driver. They are frauds. If you are fortunate enough to get them to deliver, their food tastes like oily drunk food, not quality cuisine. Stay away unless you are looking for indigestion for days."}
{"text":"I ordered take-out tonight. The food was good but this review for 5 stars is for amazing customer service.  I stated I'd pay cash but realized I only had a $50 bill so I call into after placing my order online so I wanted to make sure the large bill was ok. I'm unsure who I spoke to, the receipt said boss but the gentleman was very friendly over the phone. When my food got delivered, my cat Boston always runs out the door & this time was no  different.  He runs out & just plops down on the ground and rolls around. He never typically goes anywhere. Once  I was finished paying & getting my food, I stepped outside the door to grab my cat & in a blink of an eye, DODGER runs out the door (my dog). As the delivery guy is ready to walk down the stairs at my apartments my dog flies by him & takes off.  My boyfriend goes outside & I run after to try & catch our dog.  We found Dodger & what my boyfriend heard 1st was the pitter patter of steady feet hitting the pavement.  Shawn (Sean...spelling?), the delivery guy was sprinting down the road after my dog trying to catch him. When Dodger heard the squeaky toy, he immediately returned to my bf. All I can say is WOW! Thank you to this delivery guy for making such an effort to help get our dog back. He went above & beyond & acted like it was no big deal that he did what he did."}
{"text":"Just ordered from here this week. REALLY impressed. Great shrimp egg foo young and egg rolls! The orange chicken was just okay... Seemed like it was skimping on some of the chicken and was a little too saucy. However, it wasn't too salty like a lot of other  Chinese take-out places in Arizona so I can't down them for that.  The service was quick, they packed everything you needed without unnecessary spillage and included sweet and sour sauce for the egg rolls without even being asked to, and their prices were great (especially considering you can get egg foo young as a lunch special with fried rice and either an egg roll, soup, or soda).   It's hard to find good hole-in-the-wall style Chinese take-out places. This place was clean, their service was great, and I was really pleased with their food so far. Can't wait to go back and try some of their other items!"}
{"text":"So I have been eating at China way on alma school Rd for years. But now iI have a new favorite place to crush my cravings for Chinese food. Absolutely the best I've have. Rocketdogrc.com"}
{"text":"So I saw the good reviews of this place and wanted to give it a shot! I first want to say, the waitress was very nice and the free little salad she gave us in the beginning was good and a very nice gesture. The food itself was just...awful. I ordered orange chicken and my boyfriend ordered terriyaki chicken. We also ordered pot stickers. The pot stickers were pan fried and frankly tasted burnt... The filling for the inside was a ball of meat and wasn't very good. I figured eh sometimes people pan fry these and maybe its hand made which is why its a little weird tasting. We then receive our entrees and it was served with a huggggeee bowl of red sweet and sour sauce with a spoon and a little side of mustard.. Not sure what the mustard was for. My orange chicken was bright red, not orange. It literally tasted like candied chicken and I'm not kidding!!! It was like they cooked with kool aid. There were also these huge burnt pieces of something in my food as well. The fried rice was actually okay, but my boyfriend also did not like his food.   The waitress could tell we weren't eating much and asked if the food was okay and I did say it was fine but she was so nice and I didnt want to make an issue, we took our food togo but I'm not sure we are going to eat it."}
{"text":"so this restaurant left a menu taped to   my door so I thought I'm going to give it a try and get a delivery order, long story short we picked out what we wanted and went to submit our order for delivery only to get a message saying we are out of their delivery area good job Hot Wok good job. I ordered from another restaurant......"}
{"text":"No no no. My hubs and I tried Hot Wok Feng after getting a menu on our door and never again. First off, it took an hour and a half to get our food ... On a Tuesday .... Ordering at  7 pm. Come on. Every other Chinese restaurant  in the area has it to us within 25-35 minutes. So we got the steamed dumplings, general tso's chicken, and chicken lo mein. Lo mein was greasy, general tso's was underwhelming, and the dumplings were literally inedible. No thanks. Once was enough for us."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to restaurants during lunch time. They are always quick and I love that they have a website. My order is always ready in no more than 10 minutes. You can see the menu, find contact info, and even order through their website. The lunch specials are unbeatable for the amount of food they give you. My favorite dish is the chicken with garlic sauce, served with fried rice and crab puffs, and my total is  $5.95. The front staff is very friendly they already know my name and order."}
{"text":"Really bad Chinese food. First off, the guy answering the phone could barely understand me so I had to repeat my order and my address many times. I almost gave up and hung up the phone.   Secondly, the food took close to an hour to arrive. When it did, it looked poorly cooked and non-appetizing. The general taos chicken was bathing in bright red sauce that looked and tasted like syrup watered down with red food coloring. Never again!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorites very good friendly staff my favorite Wong tong soup and BBQ pork"}
{"text":"This place was not so good. I ordered orange chicken, pork fried rice, butterfly shrimp, and veg. lo main. The orange chicken had very little chicken but tons of syrup-ish orange sauce and thick breading. The shrimp were not properly cleaned and still contained the poop vein of the shrimp. Gross. We had the food delivered to our apartment and it did show up hot. That was good. But even the lo mein and fried rice were a little lackluster."}
{"text":"Ate here for the second time, ordered General Tso's chicken and lo mein. Everything tasted like bad fish, threw it all in the garbage. Beware"}
{"text":"Hot, cooked after you order, tasty, great prices.   I've been happy with the food & the service.  The lunch special really can't be beat here in this area."}
{"text":"Delicious! Super close to my gf's house, and the food is made really quick if you call ahead. So far I've had the Mongolian beef, seschuan beef and beef and broccoli, all of which were superb. Everyone who works there is extremely nice, and its always a pleasure going. This has become my go to Chinese spot when I'm on that side of town."}
{"text":"If you enjoy the taste of grease, you would LOVE Hot Wok. Blech. I stopped in here after leaving Safeway tonight to grab some dinner. I was craving something sweet, spicy, and fried. I ended up ordering a dinner combo of General Tsao's Chicken. I ordered it with the pork fried rice, an eggroll and then ordered a small order of vegetable low mein. The fried rice tasted like oil/grease. Seriously, there was NO other flavor to it. The pork was undetectable in flavor. The General Tsao's Chicken was ridiculously soggy. It's a fried dish so I have no idea why it had absolutely no crispiness to it. And the sauce was all sweet and no spice. It is served \"on a bed\" of steamed broccoli. Yeah, mine came with two florets that were ice cold. And the low mein? Zero flavor other than oil. It was awwwwwful. All of it was. I didn't even taste the eggroll, I just tossed it in the trash with about 80% of my $14 dinner. Oh, and while I was at the restaurant waiting for my food, the cashier person stood behind the register slurping up a plate of lo mein. It was just gross.   I will never EVER eat here again. Even Panda Express is heads and tails above this nasty food."}
{"text":"So we have been going here for over 2 years now! Never had any complaints and food is always good, tonight made me decide to write a review, placed a order and had it delivered i only had just enough $ for my order not a penny more, i handed him my card and took my order, signed the recepit and gave it back to him! Then he looked at the recepit then looked at me and said \"no tip\"! I said no not on that card..then he said he needs a tip for his service, going back and fourth for 3 minutes he kept telling me he needs a tip..i said ok your tip is DONT ASK FOR A TIP,  and i closed the door, how unprofessional is that....."}
{"text":"We decided to stop in for lunch not having been here before. What a pleasant surprise! I could smell the cleanliness of the restaurant and we were instantly greeted and seated. The menu had pictures of all the different options they offered, all reasonably priced. Our order of Hot and Sour Soup came out first and it was the absolute best I have ever had. The rest of our order followed and it was equally delicious. Our server was very friendly and made sure our drinks refilled when low. If in the area, stop in. I'm sure you'll be glad you did. We will be returning."}
{"text":"i like to say its the Filiberto's of Chinese food... kinda dirty/ghetto but good at the same time. good enough to keep me coming back, but not a place i'm going to take out-of-towners. i wouldn't eat in the dinning room but takeout or delivery is fine. i'd say if your on the fence give it a shot, it's worth it. also there is a 15% off coupon on the top of their menu so grab one at the door on your way in to pick it up and save yourself a few bucks."}
{"text":"Best Chinese I have ever had! Will definitely be my go to Chinese place from now on. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Good food. Spicy was not very spicy but all was very fresh and good. Nice people. Have done mostly delivery, but did eat in restaurant and was clean, comfortable and good service"}
{"text":"Some of the best orange Tofu I have ever tasted, we have been eating here at least 3x a month for years. the only dishes I don't love is the moo goo gi pan, its bitter, like something went bad but since it always taste that away I have come to the conclusion I should stop ordering it.. its actually the flavor and never going to change. I can eat the beef and broccoli all day every day. I have read negative things about delivery,  its true some nights its crazy and I have decided to pick up my order instead of letting my stomach growl with discontent and I can say they were legitimately slammed not being lazy or unable to deliver in a reasonable amount of time due to inability. Staff is great, very friendly, strict on delivery it must be 15.00 not 14.96  or even 14.99  which gets frustrating but buy a .60 cookie and go on your way.  My recommendations orange tofu, beef and broccoli, walnut shrimp Stay away from Moo Goo Gai Pan, Egg Drop soup, steamed pork dumplings"}
{"text":"We order the basil chicken H13. Great flavor and could easily feed 2 people. Also ordered the chicken panang H37. The panang was ordered med spice but it was super spicy lots of crushed red peppers and jalapenos with seeds.  Panang is my favorite. It's what I normally order so I feel safe to say it didn't have the normal flavors. It had too much extra spice. The coconut and curry flavor was lacking. I was really disappointed."}
{"text":"It was just alright.  I went there on a friend's recommendation.  The service was great.  The food was just okay.  I had the lunch special with Kung Pao chicken and shrimp.  The serving sizes were a little small and the price was a little higher than the normal place I go.   I most likely will not go back because I have had better food elsewhere."}
{"text":"First time here and it was delicious!  We ordered a lunch combination, my hubby got the triple delight and I got the cashew chicken, but delicious.  I also got a side salad and was fresh, full of flavor. Prices are more than fair ($16 for both of is plus tip), service is great. Our server was attentive and kind. We will be back"}
{"text":"Amazing delicious food, best I've had in all of Phoenix. Crunchy full size egg rolls, orange chicken with lots of chicken, delicious triple Mongolian, delicious loe mein"}
{"text":"I just ordered this, and when I got it.. I opened it and was so grossed out! The pot stickers looked so slimy like giant boogers in a styrofoam box! The beef with broccoli was no better.. It did NOT taste like beef.. Which makes me wonder what animal is this! It was mooshy and slimy! The fried rice was dry and flavorless... I will NOT be eating here again!"}
{"text":"We tried Hot Wok for the first time last night.  I called in a to go order and went in to pick up.  We got the family meal for $39.99.  We received a TON of delicious food, most of which everyone liked a lot.  Will definitely try again!"}
{"text":"Great lunch ! It may be 1 or 2 bucks more than other lunch specials but food is plentiful and very good. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best new York style Chinese food. Fresh and quality ingredients. ..try everything can't go wrong.  Best value in town and quality. Luv all the noodle dishes and egg foo young."}
{"text":"This place is great!! You get a ton of good food at a great price. The people there are friendly. We will definitely be frequenting this place a lot!"}
{"text":"Recently found GEM  this place has amazing Chinese food !!! I would recommend this place to anyone in Chandler. I have to tell you guys a little secret if you should dine in or at least order you an appetizer they offer dollar domestic bottle beers."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm sick, Chinese food is my go to cure. There are 3 places by my work, this being one. I saw part of a review saying that they had \"good east coast style food\" and I was sold.   Firstly the online ordering system is brilliant, really more places need this. I placed my order, inputted my personal info, marked it for \"pickup\", and set out. They called me, seeing that my address was in Tempe, to make sure i knew where they were.   This place is very small, and the tables some what crowd what little room there is. This is, however, my new takeout place. East coast style indeed.  I had the wonton soup which comes in pint and quart size for takeout. needless to say i had leftovers. The broth was nice and inviting and the wontons were delicious. My chicken fried rice was not the best, but not the worst by far. The crab rangoons though, *drool* creamy and crunchy and everything a rangoon should be.  Being from the east coast, i do get a little uppity about certain kinds of foods. For example, most Chinese places down here look at you funny if you as for duck sauce (an orange sweet and sour type sauce that comes on the table along w/ house hot mustard back east). I took a chance here and put in my comments at the end of my order: please include hot mustard (not packets) & duck sauce. And they did. :)"}
{"text":"We've ordered periodically from Hot Wok the past couple years and I'm surprised by the negative comments. We've never had a bad experience dining in, takeout and delivery. The Lo Mein is delicious as is the Orange Chicken, General Tsao, House Chicken, Beef w/ Broccoli, etc. It's all very good. The crab puffs are outstanding, I'm not sure they put in them but they are incredible. I'm not a big fan of egg rolls but theirs are pretty good and my husband likes them a lot. Our youngest is a super picky eater and will devour their orange chicken. It's a hole in the wall place next to a grocery store, inside is small but we prefer takeout or delivery anyway.  The service has always been good, friendly and they provide online ordering. The only thing stopping me from giving 5 stars is we've only tried half the menu (so far!).  Kudos and good job, Hot Wok!"}
{"text":"Won't be back. It was hot. The flavors were off. Pretty standard Chinese food meal items ordered and they were \"different\". Fine if you like that, but we didn't. Reasonably priced and fast, and everyone was friendly but the food just was not our thing."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. What a let down. The food was so bad. I'm all for cheap good Chinese. This place is a joke. And to top it off, I asked for some spicy Asian mustard. No kidding, they gave me a cup of Guldens spicy brown mustard ?!?!?"}
{"text":"MMMMMM! I love this place! I have tried basically every fast Chinese restaurant in Chandler. For the price and the fast friendly service, you can't beat it. I ALWAYS call my order in, as of course there are computer glitches and the possibility of your online order getting lost, is feasible. I love the wonton egg drop soup, the crab puffs, and the kung pao! Also, I always get menus dropped off at my doorstep with free appetizer coupons. For the folks who rated this place less than five stars, try any other chinese restarurant in Chandler and see what kind of service you get. HOT WOK FOR LIFE!"}
{"text":"For the prices it's just right! Plus the wifey loves their cheese wontons ! And they remember us every time we order it !"}
{"text":"I called spoke to nick he was very helpful and let me add extra garlic less sauce with no complaints.  The food was delivered hot and fresh.  The vegetables were crunchy and meat soft the sauces were thick. Delivery was quick and friendly.  Ask for the fresh got mustard my only compliant they never provide chopsticks"}
{"text":"This is our go-to Chinese Take Out place. My husband gets the General Tsos Chicken and I get the Orange Chicken extra spicy. So good! I love love love their pork fried rice, always order it without onions and it's perfect every time. I usually pick it up since it's literally 2 minutes from my house, but when we are super lazy and get delivery it's very fast. Their online ordering is great too because I can type in all my picky-eater instructions and they are followed every time. Good prices."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Convenient online ordering, super fast delivery, and delicious food. I have ordered from them multiple times and have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"I know many people were pissed by the restaurant. I was one of them about two years ago until recently visited the business two doors down and realized they changed the ownership.  *** New Owner ***  This place has a new owner since September 2010. It's now named \"Hot Wok Chinese Restaurant\". I decided to give it a shot. I saw a familiar face. The chef is actually from my favorite dim sum place \"Phoenix Palace\" in Chandler.   Obviously, he starts his own business now. Good for him. So I ordered the lunch with a friend of mine. At price of $5.00, I did not expect too much from it, but I have to admit that it tasted really good. Well I hope I was not treated differently.   So I went back second time last week and today. I ordered a shrimp (surprising big - See my picture) and asked not to make it too salty. The chef did what I asked for.   I will give him 4 stars for now. The food is great for the price, but I think he can do even better since I like what he did at his previous chef job at Phoenix Palace. I don't mind to pay few dollars more for larger portion. He needs to make difference than the previous owner.   I will come back again until I tried all the dishes."}
{"text":"My father and I love stopping in for the lunch special rather than do take out. Everything we've tried has been amazing and the people working there make it worth sitting down...truly nice people"}
{"text":"It was okay. I ordered General Tso Chicken w/ fried rice and any spring roll. The chicken was rather sweet and I wish the chicken was crispier. It's up in the air whether or not I'll go back."}
{"text":"Ate there for dinner again and got the shrimp with vegetables (had mushrooms, zucchini, bok choy, etc.) dinner combo which came with a soup (you can pick an egg roll or crab puff instead) and pork fried rice (you can choose white or brown rice instead). It was very good. The waitress was very nice and fast with my food. I highly recommend coming here for dinner. Their food is quality."}
{"text":"I spend a lot of money with this business as it is one of the only Chinese delivery spots in my neighborhood. I'm talking we order at least four or five times a month. Today, I ordered a 4 wing and fries combination meal and the chicken that they sent to me was very undercooked and still bleeding. I took picture of the bloody chicken after the manager of the place was rude and told my 57 year old aunt to \"walk\" to the establishment after she ordered delivery. He refused to send the driver back out with the refund that we requested and hung up the phone on my aunt. My 57 year old aunt does not drive and it was really rude that he would treat paying customers like this. I intend to write reviews anywhere I can post them about this place and send the pictures to the local news and better business bureau. I'm even going to get the health department involved. DO NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE AS THEY UNDERCOOK FOOD AND HAVE HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"Last night was the third time I've ordered from here. So far the quality and service has always been good! I ordered the pork dumplings and chicken fried rice. This is one of my favorite Chinese delivery restaurants. Its definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"I had the yucky virus that was going around with fever and sinus congestion. My dad stopped at Hot Wok and brought me wonton soup. It was divine, totally hit the spot and helped me feel better. It tasted so good!!!"}
{"text":"This is good, solid NY style Chinese food. The pork lo mein, Singapore rice noodles, eggplant with roast pork and any of the egg foo young dishes are fantastic. Classic egg rolls, the fat kind with the bubbly wrapper, delicious. The mu shu is great too. Fried rice is just ok. Delivery is a great bonus if you live in the area. The place is a little divey but the food is great, this is my go to place for Friday night takeout!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  We have never been disappointed with any dish we have ordered.  The orange beef, boneless and bone in spare ribs, chop suey and curry chicken are our favorite dishes. Great customer service, friendly and prompt delivery.  One of the best Chinese food spots in Chandler!"}
{"text":"We are from out of town and found this place on line. We went there for take-out because the reviews on another site were very good. We ordered a variety of things we like to get from our hometown Chinese restaurant. I have to say we really enjoyed our food. My son and I like shrimp and ordered Walnut Shrimp. We loved it. I noticed some of the reviews seemed to think the food was greasy. I guess I like my Chinese food a little greasy because it was great."}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer of this restaurant.  I eat here at least once a week.  This is, by a long shot, the best Chinese restaurant in the east valley and possibly all of Phoenix.  They have a very extensive menu, will cook to order, and the service is always outstanding.  Many times when I walk in I am greeted by name and brought my regular drink before even ordering.  The lunch special is a good value at about $7.  You can get just about anything on the menu as a lunch special.  My particular favorite is the Kung Pao chicken.  Spicy but not overpowering.  The pork fried rice is awesome.  I also would recommend the Mongolian Beef, General Tso's chicken, and the Orange Chicken.  The Chicken Lo Mein is also very good.  I can feed a family of four for under $40 and that includes drinks.  Recently they upgraded the dining room and now serve alcohol."}
{"text":"The most disgusting Chinese food that I have ever had! The egg drop soup tastes like chlorine and the shrimp and chicken in garlic sauce tasted how I would think dog food tastes. Never again! What a waste of money."}
{"text":"Love this place, great food exceptional prices and the selection is fantastic. Very nice staff and very quick delivery . One of the best in Chandler."}
{"text":"I like coming here for cheap, fast, delicious Chinese food. The owner is almost always there smiling and glad customers are there. It's cute. I really just like Chinese food that is more authentic than panda express, so here is my place. Everything is hot, and made to order.  ;-)"}
{"text":"My husband LOVE this place - we order it probably once a week and our order always includes the Basil Fried Rice - usually with chicken and always extra spicy.  We have tried many different dishes - including beef curry, House Pad Thai, Crab Puffs (super yummy), veggie pot stickers. The only thing we have ever ordered that wasn't a crowd pleaser was the Egg Foo Yong.  The food is the best Chinese I have had in AZ in a long while. We have experience delays in deliveries but it would never be enough to stop us from ordering from them - we could always pickup our order - which we too place online."}
{"text":"Super yummy! Visiting from Cali & I Yelped surrounding area and came here for lunch. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, quality service, and reasonable prices. The staff was kind and handle everything with care. Food was PACKED full and delicious! I recommend the egg drop soup! So tasty."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with HOT and SOUR soup done extra spicy with seafood. I could eat it every day!"}
{"text":"It took them 60 mins to deliver my food  & they are 2.2 miles away. we ordered orange chicken with wht rice. we never got the rice & the chicken was mainly  breading  & sauce. the egg rolls were overly crisp. the coconut shrimp was cold. what a waste of money!"}
{"text":"Some of the best freaking Chinese food in Chandler!   Received their menu on our door and kept it to give it a try because their prices seemed reasonable and they had our favorite dishes.   My brother was in town and we ordered crab puffs, pork lo mein, chicken and string beans, walnut shrimp and the basil fried rice. It was all wonderful and the portion sizes were huge! Nothing like left overs :)   I love nice people and the owner was so nice when we picked up! Glad to see us and when I told her it was our first time she replied \"wonderful, we will see you tomorrow again!\". Boy was she right! We have found our new go to Chinese food restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Just tried for the first time and I am really picky. Great fresh veggies, and good chicken (not the gristle pieces like at some places). Fresh and fast. Great happy hour prices too!"}
{"text":"We used to order take out from here years ago. I finally had the chance to dine in and check out the restaurant. The menu is endless so you are guaranteed to find something for everyone. I enjoyed their hot n sour seafood soup and pork fried rice are my favs. They have really good chow Mein as well. Food is good quality. Service is always super friendly."}
{"text":"This was a cool place...we stumbled upon this place as a coincidence. Glad I did I got of course the Egg Foo Young and it was really really good and made perfectly. I got the dinner special for 8.05 plus tax, came with a fried shrimp and  pork fried rice. Love the deal!  Service was cool and also prompt. Came with ton of sauces which you can't go wrong with!   If i'm ever back in AZ I could def come back to this spot.    (Damn, I forgot to take a pic. Also my mom and cousin got some stuff I dont remember the name of but it they said it was great.)"}
{"text":"Last review was 2 years ago. I have done a disservice to you all by not updating.  They knocked down the neighboring wall and expanded, half takeout half restaurant.  The food remains TERRIFIC. Orders customized if needed. Service is friendly and knowledgeable.  I'm a displaced New Yorker and this is local and the closest to what we left behind. THEY STILL GOT IT! Prices are real value. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Don't waste your money. Threw most of it away. Yuck   Ordered the spare ribs with fried rice and egg roll. Do not recommend. Also ordered the Orange chicken combo. Do not recommend that dish either. You are better off going to Panda Express."}
{"text":"We should have read the reviews first!!  We ordered online for a 5:30 delivery... Our food was delivered at 4:30.  If we had wanted it at 4:30 we would have said so.  The food was tasteless and soggy.  We will never go back.  There are too many good restaurants out there."}
{"text":"Finally! A delicious Chinese food restaurant in the area. I've been missing a good place. This is it! Price is good too! I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"I received a flyer on my door and decided to keep it in case I wanted to try this place if I didn't feel like cooking. I placed an order online for delivery on a Friday night and received my order at about 1 hour after my order was placed (not too bad!).   I ordered the Sesame Chicken but honestly was not very impressed. Maybe I need to try a few different things off the menu to determine if I like this place or not. The pork fried rice was pretty good though!   The delivery driver was very friendly.   It's a good alternative option instead of pizza or jimmy johns as there aren't too many places that delivery. I think I will have to try it again but maybe order something different."}
{"text":"Great place for Chinese. Literally, no downfalls to this place whatsoever! You get what you pay for! The food here is extremely amazing! Delivery time is acceptable along with the online pick up to order. I will definitely be coming back. I recommend this place to anyone who has an empty stomach."}
{"text":"I don't eat this type of Chinese food. Normally, I'd go to  Changs or Pei Wei but I needed delivery to my work. They were fast with that. However; I could not understand the guy on the phone. At all. So naturally they did mess up the order. Even if they hadn't! I ordered the sweet and sour chicken, thinking that would be a safe entree. It was the most bland thing I've ever eaten. No flavor, no vegetables, no pineapple or anything I would expect. Just a cup of some sweet and sour sauce that I could pour on top of the no flavor breaded white and dark meat chunks of chicken and white rice. The fried won tons, same thing. Just bland no flavor meat. I had to put those in the sweet and sour sauce too just to eat a coupe. Did not try or eat the soup. I was over it. $11 for those 2 things. Wish I had just gone to Pei Wei."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant- they remodeled and upgraded and it really looks and feels nice.  friendly staff- very genuine and nice. We felt welcomed and the server was very attentive. The food came out piping hot and the portion size is very generous. We got the dinner specials and had enough for leftovers. The Mongolian beef was really tender and flavor was good. The general tso's chicken was good too but different from what we're used to. The happy hour all day domestic beers for 99 cents is really good! We got a bottle of blue moon each which would normally be like $3-4 at a bar. Prices are decent and we didn't have to wait long for the food. Would definitely come back if we ever want Chinese food. Oh and they have sriracha and chili oil at every table which is nice so you don't have to wait for a server to get them for you."}
{"text":"We used to love this place. Last couple of times we ordered the meat was slimy and undercooked. Very nice people that work there but the place has been taking a turn lately."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and the restaurant is very clean. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because there was a young girl who gave our order to the wrong customers so we had to wait around another 30 minutes for our carry out meal. They seemed pretty busy with carry out orders and deliveries as we were told to come and pick up our meal when we called for a delivery."}
