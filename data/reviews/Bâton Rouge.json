{"text":"Big decline over the years. Went for Sunday lunch. Place was empty. The waitress wasn't particularly friendly. Didn't check on us very often or refill our water without being told. I got steak and fries. Asked for my steak rare. Whatever I got was at the very least a solid medium. It was also overly salty. Could barely taste the (tough) meat. Fries are good and well seasoned as always though. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Looove Baton Rouge. Specially this one. I don't know how/why but other Baton Rouge(s) don't taste as good as this particular one. Their signature Bbq sauce is out if this world and will leave you begging for more. You like big plates? That's the place for you then. 
I come to Baton when I want to eat well,  feel packed and satisfied. Works every time !"}
{"text":"Awsome Steak & spare ribs, clean & fast friendly service, saturdays long line awaiting place to be seated 45 to 1 hour take advantage during waiting time have a drink on the front bar 4 1/2 star restaurant & fair charges $$"}
{"text":"A large group, of around 20 or so, made a reservation for 8pm on a Saturday night. The place was suprisingly empty around this time with plenty of free tables.

The first thing I noticed after glancing at the menu was how limited and overpriced everything was. It was a single page menu. It appears on busy nights, for fights, bell center events, etc, they switch to a severely limited but overpriced menu. I was looking forward to the chicken fingers, as I wasn't all that hungry, but they were nowhere to be found. I guess it's hard to justify charging $20+ for them so they had to go. Burger and fries will set you back ~$20, which I think was one of the cheapest options. I actually had a burger and fries and it was pretty mediocre. Definitely not worth the money or something I'd have there again.

The service was really quite good, I'd say 4 stars there. My French is pretty brutal but the waiter had no issues with English. The food came out pretty fast and we were able to get out of there in a reasonable time which doesn't always happen with a largish group.

Overall it was a good time but that was more so the company. Swapping out the menu for an overpriced special event menu leaves a sour taste in my mouth and I won't be back to this location again.

There are much better options in Montreal than this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here late Sunday afternoon.  I had the rib steak with the mushroom side and she had the chicken Caesar salad.  Both meals were cooked perfectly and tasted excellent. Our waiter gave us plenty of time to decide and the food came quickly.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I've been to this Oakville location at least 15 times.  Our last visit was late Jan 2014. Food is consistent, service is good overall, but I wouldn't say \"special\".  I find it interesting that the same older man who does the hosting duties a the front fails to recognize us, even though we've been so many times and spend close to $275 per visit. And when we leave the restaurant, we are always the ones to say goodbye, and not the staff at the front door.  Oh, and the décor is in need of refreshing.  Looks very outdated."}
{"text":"I went to there for wedding anniversary. The server served gently and was nice to suggests sides for the main dish. however, potato cream soups for appetizers were cold and guessed they forgot to warm them up. Called server and they replaced with hot ones.

I ordered steak with lobster, but the lobster size was tiger shrimp size very disappointed.

Other things were fine."}
{"text":"What's with all the bad rap? Five of us met up here last Sunday night for an early dinner at 5 before we had to leave by 6:30 for a concert. We were looking specifically for somewhere to have steak and we needed the place to be open at 5 or earlier. We had 2 orders of Filet and 3 orders of Ribs. Everyone loved the food.  Our friend from Florida who manages a hotel said the ribs were the best he's had. Our steaks were just right and the salads were adequate. Service was prompt and friendly. Only bummer is that the wine list is a bit weak. They could easily offer some better wines than they do as I really couldn't recommend any of the mediocre wines to my non California friends. They settled for beer and other drinks. We ordered a cab that I know sells for about $12 at home that was marked up to $45."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of dining here with 14 of my family members for a very special birthday. From Michelle the manager, to the appetizers, main courses, desserts and our awesome server Mike everything was perfect! Service was really top notch. Ribs were absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour and avoid this specific location. We were there prior to the Amy Shumer concert. First, they're menu is scaled down during an \"event\" night. Fair enough, they want to be quick and provide quality, methinks!

Took 90 minutes for food to arrive, which meant we had to eat fast. When we asked our waiter about the wait, he said \"don't you have reserved seats?\" Clearly, he's not been to the Bell Centre in a while, it can take 30 mins to get in with the added security. Luckily the show started late so we were ok.

Back to the food which was awful! The vegetables were not fresh, for sure! I ordered the Beet and Goat Cheese salad. I asked the waiter if there were fresh beets or marinated, because I don't like the latter, and his response \"Come on this is baton rouge!\". Really? The salad contained one 1/2 beet cut in 4 tiny pieces and one tsp. of goat cheese... this is the quality he was referring to?

Service is arrogant, food is not worth the price, even for the location. Note I regularly go to Baton Rouge across from Place des Arts and there the service is amazing and the food as well - even on the night of a show. 

This place is a rip-off that lives off the fact that they are across from the Bell Centre."}
{"text":"Baton Rouge never disappoints,  whether in Montréal or Toronto.  

With three kids,  from out of town,  we wanted good quality and reliable fare.  Filet mignon excellent, mouthwatering baked potato with the works, delicious Louisiana chicken salad.  Kids liked their pasta though some steamed broccoli on the side would have been nice,  but not available.  Wine pricey but good selection. 

Desert incredible,  Baton Rouge chocolate cake super chocolatey,  Key Lime pie with a graham cracker crust divine.  Cappuccinos excellent.  

Waiter's timing was a bit off as far as serving adults before the kids?!  And he didn't ask us if we wanted coffee and dessert.  But he did serve the kids their dessert first... Lol.  He did acknowledge he was new,  and was very accommodating overall."}
{"text":"Came in late on a Wednesday night about 30 min before closing. This was not my first choice as I was hoping to try some authentic French montreal food. Unfortunately most closed by 10 pm. 

It was late and I didn't want a big meal. Server suggested ribs or a salad but these were fairly large portions so I went with the appetizer portion of chicken tenders and an iced tea. The ice tea came in a very small glass probably less than 6 oz. it also tasted like what you get from a Lipton or nestea canned drink which is horrible. At $3 it was not a good value. So I didn't have high expectations for my chicken tenders. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!  The tenders were not dry and came with plenty of fries to complement. It was definitely an above average dish. 

Kudos on the chicken tenders but thumbs down on the ice tea. Thanks for staying open. Server was also friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Durant mon périple au Canada de 23 jours, ce fut quasiment ma \"cantine\" de prédilection... Que ce soit à Montréal, à Québec City ou à Toronto, cette chaîne est l'endroit parfait pour trouver une nourriture, généreuse et savoureuse ; un cadre, feutré et rustique ; un service, avenant et souriant !!!!
Filet Mignon - Haut de surlonge - Côte de boeuf au jus - Côtes levées de porc barbecue - Assiette de tendres de poulet Bâton... sans oublier les Burgers, les Clubs sandwich ou les fameuses Salades César 'entre autre), l'éventail de la cuisine américano-canadienne est bien représentée. 
Je m'en lèche encore les doigts... même si cela n'est pas ma cuisine préférée !!!!"}
{"text":"Waited long, I asked for a medium rare steak and was served a raw steak full of fat.  My partner had to eat alone since I had to send my steak back twice I went hungry left hungry and was offered nothing but an apology.  I will never go to this location again as customer service isn't the best"}
{"text":"Food nothing to write home about, but not too bad either. I had a veggie sandwich which came packed with grilled veggies on bland, soggy white bread and fries, which were very tasty. My friend got the ribs and liked them a lot. As soon as he let me try his baked potato I wished I had ordered that as my side: it was the best thing on the menu! I am not in a rush to go back, as for the quality I think it was a little pricey. The ambience was pleasant enough, though, and the food passable."}
{"text":"This place is always busy... I find a little pricy but the best steak salad with chunks of blue cheese and dressing you will ever eat!
Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The fare was very similar to that which I would expect at a number of American chain restaurants, but to Baton Rouge's credit, they pulled it off very well.  I ordered the fried calamari appetizer as a somewhat lighter lunch.  My wife had this huge burger I would have named the Western, though I don't know what the menu called it.  

The calamari were tender and cooked through perfectly.  A light and flaky breading coated it nicely as it lay on a bed of lettuce.  The green onions  and lemon juice sprinkled on top provided a delightful cruch and bite.  A chipotle mayonnaise accompanied the dish, but was not spicy enough at all.  The waiter was able to bring more powdered chipotle, making it just right.

The burger was cooked well-done as a rule in this area, so I can't really comment on the quality of the preparation or on the taste.  The bacon and BBQ sauce were tasty, and the bun was perfectly toasted. Thin and crispy, the accompanying fries went great with the kicked up chipotle mayo from my meal!

The waitstaff was very nice and very capable!  

Overall, a nice place to eat especially if can enjoy your visit on the terrace."}
{"text":"so my wife and I decided to go. We were seated quite quickly and we ordered two drinks I had a scotch and my wife had a bloody Mary ,22 minutes later we received our drinks . I asked the waitress what took so long since the restaurant was quite empty.  Her reply was \"I don't know\" !!!  Placed my order for a full rack of baby back ribs with french fries and coleslaw and my wife had the combo with french fries and coleslaw .so our plates arrived within 10 minutes ,on my plate there were a ton of french fries and a cup of coleslaw and my ribs were very small they were very chewy and very little meat on them and the same thing for my wife's plate .it looked like a the total amount of meat was around 4 to 5 ounces . What a ripoff and these ribs were not even smoked. They use liquid smoke and boil their ribs. That fake !!! for the amount of money we spend  this place is a total rip off you won't catch me going to this place ever again baton  rouge thanks but no thanks"}
{"text":"It was similar to any chain restaurant in the states. People were nice, atmosphere was mall-esq, food was OK."}
{"text":"What can I say. Bâton rouge is bâton rouge. Amazing ribs and salads and chicken. Great ambiance but prices keep getting higher."}
{"text":"Nice terrace, good bloody caesars. Lobster sandwich was a little disappointing and overpriced but was still light and fresh on hot sunny day. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Haven't been back since management nearly ruined my friend's party last summer. 
She made a reservation for 8 people weeks in advance, knowing that it can be hard to get a group table on a Saturday night in the summer time. One of the girls in our group arrived very early in case that would help secure our table on time. It made no difference. We were all forced to wait in a cramped entryway until our table was ready. We were never offered a seat at the bar or anything, but more than once, a pushy waiter asked for our drink orders (without giving us a menu.) All we asked for was water because it was a hot summer day but it took ages for us to get any. Which was fine, because our table - the one we had reserved WEEKS in advance - wasn't ready and they wouldn't tell us why or how much longer we'd have to wait. People without reservations, mostly couples, breezed right past us. Still, no apologies from anyone or promises to seat us soon. We were seated nearly an hour later, right around the time I started looking up phone numbers of other downtown restaurants to see if they had space for a group of people willing to spend money on food and drinks. 
Once seated, I politely asked our waitress to speak to a manager, because I've heard that that's the best way to deal with such problems. She said he was busy but that she would try to send him over. A few minutes later, some clown shows up at our table and says \"Yeah, you wanted to see me?\" So I explained to him what had happened, how long ago we had reserved a table and what time we had reserved it for. He chose to be confrontational. He literally said \"Well, it's a Saturday night in the summertime, downtown Montreal, quartier des spectacles, what do you expect?\" Um, I expect to get a table if we reserved one. That's what reservations are for. He disagreed with me and rudely said \"what can I do?\" ...That was not an offer to salvage my friend's party. It was a way to try to get me off his back. I've seen better customer service at McDonald's. I've met homeless people who were nicer about getting my money. This manager was rude and not at all understanding. 
The food was underwhelming - too expensive for dishes that Baton Rouge used to do better, and poorly plated at that. 
The waitstaff, on the other hand, is the only reason this place deserves any stars. Our waitress was friendly and actually NICE to us, and a few other staff members were game to join in on our birthday and bachelorette games without ever making anyone feel uncomfortable. I just wish they didn't have to work in restaurant hell, because they deserve better. 
If it were socially acceptable, I wouldn't have paid for my meal and instead left a tip equivalent to the price of a lukewarm plate of ribs and a run-of-the-mill sangria."}
{"text":"Having ordered takeout I arrived at the restaurant to pick up my order. No problems there. Staff was very helpful & prompt. 

If you see above- there was some type of hair in my soup. I don't know what it was. The photo really doesn't do it justice.

I called back to the restaurant and spoke to a manager who was very non chalant about the situation. Maybe this is a common occurrence I'm not too sure. 

I was offered a new soup, however i would have to go retrieve it. After saying no unfortunately that won't work..he simply replied saying that's fine ill make a note of it & you can have it when I have a minute to stop in...

His overall attitude towards me and the situation was not apologetic in the slightest. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here the other weekend for a friend's birthday and was surprised by the great service and friendly staff. The food was a hit as well. I ordered the maple and spice ribs from the feature menu that also included a soup or salad to start. 

To start I had the caesar salad and was happy to find that it was perfectly dressed and delicious. I loved that it was a vinaigrette caesar dressing rather than the usual creamy style. My main arrived with a huge portion of coleslaw piled on my plate, but I was disappointed by the flavours which fell flat compared to the scrumptious sweet potato fries and flavourful ribs. On the up side, the sweet potato fries were super crunchy and well seasoned, and more than made up for the mediocre coleslaw. The ribs fell off the bone and had great flavour from the maple and spices. Although I was served a full rack of ribs there just wasn't that much meat. For $25 though the meal had great value. 

I do recommend that you eat here, however I would avoid being seated in the basement where it's dark and windowless."}
{"text":"Quality hasn't been the same since 2000.
I remember a time when the his restaurant used to be really good with fall-off-the-bone ribs and perfectly cooked chicken tenders. Now, the ribs are tough and dry, plus the chicken tenders are burnt. 

It doesn't surprise me though, the restaurant has a prime tourist location so they can serve whatever they want and people will come. Not the locals though, they'll stay away like me from now on.

Edit: I've contacted them at the below address a while back and they never got back to me. They probably don't care."}
{"text":"Good place to eat and relax. Very elegant dining. We had lunch today. I had BBQ ribs and coleslaw ,  chicken tender and fries  for my daughter  for $35.00  tax and tip included. They have lunch menus that are very affordable. Service was good. I really love the place and they have private dining rooms. 

They have a couple of private rooms good for special occasions. 

Been here a couple of times. And I love it."}
{"text":"First time I've ever been to not only this location but also to to this chain of restaurants. 
Very similar to places like the Keg, or Milestones. With most of their menu being steak and lobster oriented. 
The starter Cesar was good, nothing spectacular but still good. I had mushroom caps filled with lobster and cheese as a appetizer, which again were good, but nothing spectacular. I do wish however that I did try the lobster poutine, as that did sound like something uniquely Canadian.
My main dish was lobster tail and steak which was cooked beautifully, with the steak just melting in your mouth.
The dessert that came with my meal was okay, being a rich chocolate cake. However since it was my birthday, our host brought out this decadent chocolate mousse cake that was just wonderful and made my birthday dinner all that better. 
The staff was super friendly, and polite, making me really enjoy my dining experience.would more then likely go back if I was in that area."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere in a great location! Our server was very friendly and personable and had great knowledge of the menu and specials. I ordered 10 oz. ribs and fried chicken combo ($28) with hot cinnamon apples and french fries (very good fries). I did not like the tiny portion size of the apples and they were not flavoured intensely enough for my liking. The ribs were on the shorter side and I remember a few years ago I was able to order a whole rack of ribs for about $22, where as in 2016 $22 will only get you the basic 10 oz (half rack) rib platter. The fried chicken tenders were well cooked but covered in a heavy soggy batter.

My girlfriend ordered a 10 oz portion of prime rib with au jus, mashed potatos and vegetables. Had I known the prime rib would be that tasty, and succulent I would have ordered it as well. 

Long story short, the ribs still fall off the bone but the portion and price have changed a lot. Prime rib competes with prime ribs you can find at up-scale downtown restaurants."}
{"text":"A great place to go with friends, or even alone for a succulent meaty dinner.


 The most economical choice on the menu: Hamburgers that start at around $10. The fanciest will set you back a good $35. The most memorable are the baby back ribs. Whoever has had them agrees that they are the best ones they have ever had.


 The seats are comfy, service always nice, and I must admit their round tables (for larger groups only) do add a lot to the ambience.


 I can't recommend this place enough. Just go and try their meat for yourself!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was close to my hotel and was recommended by the desk staff.  They were spot on in the suggestion.  The service was terrific, the selection was varied and cooked perfectly! I will be back on my next visit to the area."}
{"text":"Bonne ambiance, du moins quand le band live dans le coin du bar joue! :-)

J'ai même pu réserver par l'application Open Table avec brio!

C'est un Bâton Rouge, le service est est soigné et le suivi est bien fait. la bouffe est à la hauteur de la franchise. Situé dans le Complexe Desjardins alors accessible de l'intérieur comme de l'extérieur, idéal pour finir une journée de magasinage sous-terrain.

J'y ai goûté les légendaire ribs pour la 1ère fois (hé oui, y'a des choses comme ça qu'on néglige dans la vie...) et j'ai compris pourquoi tout le monde m'en parlait positivement... malgré que pour le prix, il y des \"smoke house\" qui se défendent mieux à mon avis :-P

Bref, ce Bâton Rouge en est un bon et vous ne serai pas déçu, surtout durant les festivals!!!"}
{"text":"Well, the soup was Ok. For a restaurant that calls itself a 'steakhouse', I expect a descent steak, cooked at least close to how it was ordered.
I ordered a NY Strip rare, which arrived med.well. I'm not in the habit of
returning food, but for $34 I returned it & consequently had to wait another 20 minutes for it to be replaced. This one was med, so figured that was the best I was going to get (a small over cooked steak).
Disappointing to say the least. 
Maybe it was just an off night, because for some reason the place is always packed.
Summary: loud, overpriced with poor quality control."}
{"text":"Attended this restaurant on a Friday evening. The inside is huge, neat, however pretty empty for a weekend night. 
The A.C was on, and kept the restaurant very chilled. 
The calamari was excellent, however the sauce needed to be given in a larger portion. We had to ask the server for more sauce. 
The meals were decent/ average. Nothing spectacular. 
I ordered the lobster linguine. Around $26. It has a balsamic glaze on the pasta. The pasta was creamy, soft (not aldente). It was ok. However the lobster was the show! It was cooked fully. Soft, white and delicious. However, a garlic butter sauce should have been served with the lobster as it was much needed. 
My other guest all ordered the steak and lobster. Their lobster did not come in the shell. And it was questioned if it was even real lobster. It was curled up, and could have been imitated. 
The desert was the best part. 5/5 on the cookie ice cream. Soft, gooey, warm, moist, chocolatey. The ice cream parted the tasted quite well. 
The bill was over $220, so the desert was free. Overall, worth a try"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and very romantic. The service is good and the food is fantastic. I always order the Louisiana BBQ Chicken. Their fries is out of this world. Their BBQ sauce is addicting! I also asked for Cajun Mayo for the fries added alot of flavor. The only down is that the coleslaw salad was disappointing. Thats all everything else was amazing. I highly recommend it. Bon appetit"}
{"text":"Best Baton Rouge I have ever been to! Amazing ambiance, dark mahogany colors inside. I had the lunch special Louisiana BBQ Chicken with sweet potato fries. Wow that was tasty"}
{"text":"I love their menu even thought there are not much choices compare to other steakhouses I know but the quality is top notch. No need to go to a fancy restaurant to taste a great filet mignon or a fresh piece of Ahi tuna. Their salmon tartar and chicken cream soup are terrific!  I always eat there on some special occasions and the service is always great! Right amount of food and rather generous for some items."}
{"text":"Baton Rouge is overrated and overpriced to me. Even when I order my very favorite dish, it's a bit too salty."}
{"text":"The food was really good and I loved the ribs with baked potato.  The service awesome and totally fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Baton Rouge is easily my favorite restaurant in Montreal! The food and the atmosphere are always great."}
{"text":"Fantastic food,atmosphere and service this place is great.  We chose it by mistake to be honest,  we did intend to goto the Keg tonight but it was closing in a hour so decided to give Baton Rouge a try and SO glad we did.  I found it far superior to The Keg to be honest and the menu was far more extensive.  I will gladly pass up The Keg for Baton Rouge anytime."}
{"text":"Les meilleures ribs que j'ai mangé jusqu'ici à Montréal après celles du Vargas.
Cadre très sympatique également et service très correct"}
{"text":"Bon restaurant style STEAKHOUSE, bonne viande, décor sympathique"}
{"text":"Go for lunch special people!!!
$22 gets you a huge rack of the best f'in ribs that fall off the bone. Fries and a choice of coleslaw. That deal for dinner would be over double. Yes others have lunch ribs specials but nothing compares to the quality and sauce."}
{"text":"Went in to have steak and lobster as part of prix fix menu. Great portions, great taste, and one of the best cheese cakes for dessert that ive had in a long time! Got a coupon for a free spinich dip to try after their renovations are done. Waiter was on his \"A game\" not missing a beat with his service. Will go back after renovations."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my family, we ordered the spinach dip and it was on except we got salsa that had turned..One of my kids had a burger that was dry the other a ceased salad that was oily. My partner and I each had a roasted beef sandwich which were pretty bland.The quality has gone down from what it once was, but for that price if rather go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Had supper with my family my husband and I had the prime rib, asked for it medium. We both received it rare, and cold. The vegetables were frozen carrots with over cooked red and yellow peppers. My husband waited along time for the waitress to come back to the table to ask for a recook. He got it back 5 minutes later with sauce poured over it and heated in the salamander. Was the same rare. We won't ever be going back after paying 130$. So not worth the money."}
{"text":"Ordinary. Ribs were burnt and didn't taste as good as I recalled the last time I ate here. Wine is overpriced.  Service is ok and a litte hurried."}
{"text":"Disappointed overall. The food was OK, the service was OK, the beer list was pretty sparse, the martini I had wasn't mixed right.  The wait staff is friendly which is why it gets 3 stars from me.  I went out with the same group later in the week and we had an opportunity to go back to the Baton Rouge again for dinner and everyone wanted to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here with the family, a group of 7. 

Food:

The food was pretty good, I ordered the Blackened Cajun Steak... But when I arrived, they had given me a normal steak with no seasoning at all. 
At the same time, my aunt was left sitting there with no food. The waitress didn't even notice until we pointed it out. She then went to the back to find out what happened to our orders. 

They promptly came back with a normal steak for her and a properly seasoned steak for me. 

Service:

Adequate service, not great though. We had too many waitresses serving our table that didn't seem to be communicating with each other and one of them seemed to make us feel very rushed, and the attitude she showed when I spoke up about my unseasoned steak was a little annoying.

The good thing was she was prompt with getting us the food

Overall:

It's pretty okay. Would maybe go to a different location but the environment was nice and on point."}

Service et decor très agréable un très bon resto pour les mordus de viandes rouge ...."}
{"text":"Pas mal pour manger une bonne viande. 
Compter 35 Dollars pour un plan."}
{"text":"Baton Rouge, went for a lunch party with family. We were placed at the big table and arrived fairly early. Our table was the first to have our order taken. While waiting for the food we watched all of the tables around us getting their soups, followed by their meal. We received our soups and then more waiting.  The potato soup with cheese and bacon was good. Looking around it seems everyone else is working on their last bites. While the waitress was going around refilling water she didn't
 refill my side of the table, I guess because we were out of reach and couldn't be bothered to ask if we would like more.

My mother was going to go talk to someone but I opted to go for her instead, she is way too intense. Told a waiter that we didn't get our food yet. He replies: \"perfect, I'll let them know.\"
I didn't like his response, I didn't think it was perfect that we had to wait 2 hours before we got our meal.

I went to speak with the floor manager, let him know that we've been waiting. \"Listen, we have 122 people to serve and we're trying to convenience everybody.\"

I understand that but we did arrive early but waiting 2 hours is ridiculous. Your foods coming out now. It better be after 2 hours.

My cousin who organized the event got his food just before us. Blows my mind how this place works.

Received our Rib Sandwich, mine was alright but my gf kept picking out bones from hers.

The waiter came over to apologize for the long wait, explaining how there's 120 people and all the chefs are freaking out. I was in the middle of writing all of this when he came over to apologize. He was cool and i dont blame him. No matter, I'm still angry it took that long and the manager would rather give an excuse then apologize. 

After everyone finished eating we got coffee. My mom went to put the milk in her coffee and it was a big lump. Expired milk with their coffee."}
{"text":"Ill start off by saying i thought our waiter was excellent and did his job fanatically.

But thats the only positive i have to say. Calamari was cold
Spinach dip was like water
Asked for medium rare cook on my steak, it was very well done.
Was fine all day but soon after my not so good meal i was forced to run to the washroom and let me tell you it was not pretty.

Forced to cancel my evening plans i have been running to the toilet non stop for several hours now where it just comes out like water. 

Very very terrible experience. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"You're always served well. Most waiters are friendly. The food is always good and fresh. They're very generous with their portions! You never leave hungry that's for sure. Good food at a reasonable price. My fiancée and I keep going back because she loves the chicken or tuna sandwich with sweet potato fries and I'm a fan of their grilled vegetable sandwich with French fries mmmm. Definitely worth a try! Oh and the giant chocolate chip cookie with ice cream is delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has got to be a very polarizing place for customers. First, it had great ribs, steaks, and burgers. Also if you get to sit outside (and it's warm of course), it's a very nice view of place des arts.
On the other hand, it's overpriced for the service and it's not very clean.
Bottom line, if you like ribs or like outdoorsy downtown places, it's good, otherwise look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great service and food, tried many of their plate especially the risotto and the pepper steaks, well done and delicious. The waiters I got so far were all excellent."}
{"text":"Bad service, great food... Manager saved the day with a freebie but still not the best Bâton Rouge in Montreal. 
Stick to Brossard..."}
{"text":"Finally visited Baton Rouge, ventured in on a Friday evening. I was surprised at how large the restaurant is, much bigger than I expected. 

For myself good food can never overcome poor service and conversely, good service cannot pull up poor to mediocre food. The later is my opinion of Baton Rouge. I found the staff to be pleasant and professional from the hostess to our server. It was a Friday night and the place was close to full yet the service was attentive, exactly what one would expect for this type of establishment. 

And now for the food. Let's start with the beer list. I really like beer and a decent beer contributes a lot to my dining experience, or in this case takes away. The beer selection is lame, one of the lamest I've seen in a long time. I actually made a note to myself to wander into BPs to see if Baton Rouge directly copied the BP beer list. The beer list is main stream water downed swill. I also feel quite strongly that restaurants should support local suppliers therefore some Big Rock/Wild Rose/Grizzly Paw/etc. should be offered. 

Enough about the beer. I did a little research prior to going and was surprised to learn Baton Rouge is a chain. Had I not known a head of time I would of figured it out when the food was served. Drop a championship chef in a chain restaurant and you still get the corporate approved offerings. The first thing you notice is the plating, it is uninspired, exactly what you get with a kitchen full of line cooks. The plating on our mains was as boring as it gets, food plopped on big white plates. To be fair, the plating on one of our desserts was quite nice. The food wasn't bad, it was okay but we expected a bit more for the price. In fact my wife commented that she would just as soon have the instant ribs from Safeways and next time she would try the prime rib. Our desserts were hit and miss, our server recommended the Mystique cake which was nicely plated and my wife enjoyed. I ordered the apple cobbler which turned out to be apple pie. Not a big deal because i like both but when I order apple cobbler I expect apple cobbler. 

In summary the food is okay but I can get okay food at a lot of places for a lot less. I give the staff a 4 and the food a 2 giving an average score of 3. 

Would I go back? Yes, but only for the reason I walked in the first time. I can walk in on a Friday evening and get a table."}
{"text":"if you want to eat ribs this is the place.very juicy and delicious."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service this was strike 3. This is the 3rd time I go there with family and it's been horrible every time.  I was hoping it was just a bad coincidence the first 2, but I'm definitely going back! First time we waited over an hour for our meal, second time we had to get up and find our own drinks, and this last time we had the rudest waitress ever! We waited for ever for our meal, where not offered refills and when we asked she was very rude about it. Our meal came with a soup and we never got it, even though we asked twice, the third time we asked was when we finally got our meals her response was \"you still want it? \" no apologies, nothing! The meals were also a disappointment!  I would not mind paying their prices if the experience was pleasant! If your looking to have a nice time, stay away from that place!"}
{"text":"An average place to eat with an above-average price tag. Every now and then I get in the mood for ribs and this place never really leaves me satisfied. This branch is WAY better than the one on de la Montagne in terms of service. Our waiter was really nice and checked up on us. Ribs were not that great, coke was majorly watered down (i asked the waiter to get me a new one but it was the same deal 2nd time around)."}
{"text":"Food is terrific - service is top notch. Atmosphere is dim, sophisticated - older. Good mixed drinks and sangria. Certainly on the pricy side."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant , the menu is for every taste,  the food has excellent flavors from the different salads to their main dishes , every time I go I find it excellent and it is not expensive  for the best ingredients they use and big portions !"}
{"text":"Just visited post renovations, it looks amazing, completely redone; great job!! Food fantastic as per usual, great service too. Keep up the great job!!! 

Surpasses the competition in all aspects."}
{"text":"Best ribs ever. Love the atmosphere, love the food. Every time I go there I have to have their ribs. So tender they fall off the bone."}
{"text":"Not Gluten Free friendly for Lunch & Dinner menu only offers gluten soup and no choice of salad but the ribs are good."}
{"text":"Shared a meal with a friend.  Was pretty decent North American steak and ribs.  Would probably look to go somewhere else if I had a car but this was in walking distance of the Sheraton so we were quite happy with it."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with the family recently.  We had no idea whether it was good or not, but we were tired and hungry and were able to be seated at the last table outside.  Aside from not being used to people smoking around us, the food and service was very good.  Very pleasantly surprised.  My wife got a salad with chicken tenders, artichoke hearts, etc. - very good,  Kids got chicken tenders and calamari and a salad - all very good.  I got the chicken club which isn't a traditional club sandwich - it was better.  Served on crusty italian bread.  Sitting outside on St. Catherine's street, having a nice meal with a Rickard's on draft - very nice evening.  Pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Ma femme et moi avons apporter nos parents souper au Bâton Rouge, Carrefour Laval. Quel belle soirée! Un service impeccable de notre serveuse Stéphanie. La nourriture très bonne! Côte-levé et pomme de terre garnis, les entrées de calamars fris et la trempette d'artichaut fu un délice! Le dessert, notre serveuse nous a recommandé le  gâteau red velvet. Wow!"}
{"text":"My first ever negative review of a dining experience.  $150 gave us 2 glasses of wine with 2 filet plates. Mine was supposed to be medium, but was well done and the mashed potatoes were Luke warm at best (it was still juicy & tender).  My wife's plate was delivered with no baked potato, only to be told at that time that none were left so she opted for the sweet potatoes which were string cut & lacked flavour.  At least these were served quickly.  The waiter never once asked if anything was to our satisfaction. 
We know of several places were the value is significantly better and will stick with those."}
{"text":"I'm guessing that given the location of this particular chain restaurant & the previous reviews, that this branch is somewhat of tourist trap.  Well we dined here as tourists during Jazz Fest & have to admit we had a very good experience!  My cheeseburger was absolutely delicious as was my side of sauteed mushrooms.  The one sour note was that yes the prices are exorbitant for what you get.  Sure, we had an excellent meal but I'm guessing most of the waiter-service establishments in this area know that they've got the market covered for people who don't want fast food, & realize they can charge these prices, because people like us will pay 'em.  And we did!  But overall, we were very satisfied with our dinner here."}
{"text":"Oi. Normally a go to place, until we got food poisoning. Three out of six got severe stomach cramps and the sh**s. Not pleasant. Issued a complaint and had no response.  Since then everybody has said never eat the cole slaw from there. Just a heads up."}
{"text":"This is a chain that is way overpriced with poor to moderate quality food.  The salad with chicken I had was horrible.  My husband's seared tuna seemed rancid. It was a huge waste of money."}
{"text":"I'd' never been to a baton rouge restaurant before but my boyfriend had and had  always had good food so we popped in here before heading to the centre bell. 

The service was absolutely fantastic, in fact, probably the best so far in Montreal. It's just a shame that the food doesn't match it. 

First of all, my boyfriend seemed surprised at the prices and I have to admit that some items seemed fairly expensive. We ordered the salmon and a burger. The salmon was tasty but not fantastic. The burger looked good but was really dry so I was disappointed. 

Overall a bit of a disappointment for the price but impeccable service!"}
{"text":"The food was cold and the ribs were okay in terms of taste.  I supplemented my fries for a house salad and there was an up charge of $3.  I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Coming into Montréal after a long train ride, this was the most appealing of the few places that were still open around 10pm on a Thursday. Located right across the street from the Museum of Contemporary Art and Opera House, we were expecting inflated prices and sub par food. Well, we were only half wrong. You'll notice the warm wood decor and ambiance with an elevate area for large groups or the lively bar for hockey fans. 

The food is mostly American standard with a bit of a French flair. I had a grilled chicken salad with artichoke, asparagus, bacon, 3 types of cheeses and accompanied with a lemon ginger dressing. My girlfriend had an angus cheeseburger with bacon on a brioche and thinly cut fries. We both enjoyed our food but I did not like that a lemon ginger dressing was cream based rather than vinegar based. The fries disappeared before I could blink.

The staff makes it a casual and comfortable place so you can expect to be taken care of. You won't likely be disappointed with what you order but at the same time don't expect to be impressed either."}
{"text":"I went here with my mom as they have been advertising Lobsterfest. We went exsctly at 4 pm and they had \"ended\" lunch at 4. Their dinner \"entrees\" were about 15 dollars more per dish which I thought was ridiculous. My mom got the lobster baby spinich salad ($18!!) and I had the seafood linguine. My dish was quite good the scallops couldd have used a little bit more of a sear but were done well, and the shrimps were HUGE like MAMMOTH, and were nicely done. The sauce was a bit lack luster and needed more creamy-ness. 
My dish plus my mothers plus 1 glass of wine and a pepsi = $90.95 with taxes. Overall NOT worth it. I probably won't be back as it's ridiculously overpriced. 
The server was very nice but brief, not much of a personality shined through and as soon as we stepped in we found it very dark for the afternoon. I could understand dimming the lights for a dinner service but the middle of the afternoon sitting in the darkness seemed silly. 
Anyways the food was a 3 but the price was a big issue for me. If you want a salad you could make at home, or a pasta dish you could get cheaper elsewhere, for about $10-$15 more, then go here."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for my wife birthday.. order calamari to start.. it was good.. for our main, my wife order chicken mushrooms risotto and me lobster tail with ribs. It was delicious.. don't mind going back again. Good job kitchen.. keep it up :)"}
{"text":"This place was very pricy for what you get. The homemade chicken fingers were quite good, and a large portion, but the pasta was outrageously expensive for the amount of food. It was a $17 pasta dish and it cost $6 extra to put chicken on it, but there was very little pasta and it wasn't even a normal-sized piece of chicken breast! The beers here were also very expensive, but that seems to be typical of Montreal."}
{"text":"Went here with an unusal mix, 4 people over 60 and four kids 18, 16 12 &8.  The other couple was taking care and cooking for the 4 kids while parents were away.   The kids knew exactly what to order shrimp and ribs with a side.    The older ones like myself ordered steak, fish etc.   Frankly the food we ordered was mediocre but kids food looked great and they enjoyed it.

Huge portions for ribs, shrimps, and sides.  Not so much for fish,steak pasta.

Bottom line,  kids ordered so much food they had to take 1/2 of it home which may be a reflection of the cooking abilities of the couple we were with."}
{"text":"Had an event here. They were SO accommodating, friendly and above and beyond. From staff to management, thank you for doing a great job!!

Also, their Santa Fe chicken was absolutely delicious ! I'm definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"I have been to different locations of Baton Rouge.  As usual the settings are the same in the restaurant.  The waitress is very friendly.  The rib is so large that I almost cannot finish it.  It is tender and juicy.

The restaurant has another set price menu that costs $35 that includes an appetizer, entrée and dessert.  Not a bad price! I have not tried it and don't know whether other Baton Rouge has it or it is just for the New Year period."}
{"text":"During \"juste-pour-rire\" festival, this place is crazily full of people, but still a perfect place for hanging out with friends. When you are finally led to your table, after waiting in queue for 30min. The lobster sandwich is my favourite. Last time I ordered BBQ chicken with smashed potato, which was a lot. I could barely finish even thought I was hungry. The soup is recommended!"}
{"text":"Great place down town"}
{"text":"Not a fan.  While the ribs and steak may be great, I can't say; stay away from the seafood.  The first time I was there, I ordered the Ahi Tuna, safe bet as all that needs to be done is proper seasoning and a kiss from the grill.  Second time, same thing - Ahi.  It was good.  Third time, I figured I would try something different; bad, bad mistake.  Calamari and shrimp, supposedly grilled.  They were overcooked and rendered inedible.  The Calamari had the consistency of rubber tire, the shrimp was tough and almost tasteless were it not for all the oil that it was floating around in.  It was horrendous.  The type of oily that leaves you nauseated.  I sent a letter to their head office and to their credit, they sent me a gift certificate to try again.  

I tried again, last night.  The \"special\" was Mahi Mahi.  I love Mahi Mahi.  My companion and I ordered the Mahi Mahi.  He ordered his blackened with Cajun seasoning and I ordered a simple grilled offering.  Half my fish was relatively cooked, the other half was almost raw.  

His was cooked but was far from \"blackened\".

We had a third dinner companion who ordered the ribs and was very happy with them.

I won't be returning to Baton Rouge.  I believe that when something is offered on a menu and/or announced as a \"special' that the kitchen is capable of delivering a properly prepared dish.  

If you plan a dinner at the restaurant, apparently, you are quite safe ordering the steak or the ribs; I do not recommend the fish or seafood, with the obvious exception of the Ahi which is, frankly, rather hard to screw up."}
{"text":"So I am a fan of Baton Rouge, but really, it's pretty generic. A little overpriced for what it is, but it is consistent. It's a good place to go with a big group of people, but honestly for the price you are better off going to a smaller steakhouse in the plateau that has a little more charm. I still give it 4 stars because it really is not bad, it's just kinda standard."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely fine. Staff were very eager to please and checked in often. Service was efficient. Food was tasty. My kids loved it. I would recommend for a family night out."}
{"text":"Should have gone to Subway...

Thursday night.  Let's start with the service.  Seated myself in the bar and waited for five minutes plus for the bartender.  Looked like he was pulling double duty as host also.  Shouldn't really have mattered, there weren't that many people there. Tough to get a beer. He payed more attention to an off duty employee than he did to any of the four tables he was supposed to be minding. 

The menu is pretty sparse.  Chicken fingers, Ahi tuna and other limited fare put together in varying combinations of salads, sandwiches and entrees.  The usual suspects like steak, ribs, etc.  Didn't see much of an attempt at anything Cajun/Creole.  Ordered the Santa Fe chicken.  Very lackluster...I've had better quality food on airplanes. 

 I really give folks in this business a lot of latitude. It's not easy to deal with some customers and when you're swamped it's sometimes difficult to maintain an outstanding level of service.  This was more a case of poor management and training as well as not having the right people in place.  Too bad. I don't think that it will be too long before this location suffers the same fate as the one in Mississauga."}
{"text":"I got the rib eye steak and it was pretty good, but fatty.  The baked potato was good and the salad was decent.  They came out with fresh rolls with the salad, but my brother in law got the hamburger and he was disgusted with the buns.  My sister got the top sirloin and it was not too bad either.   My wife got the filet and it was just ok.  The service was slow at first, but then after we ordered it picked up a bit.  Not a bad place, but overly overly priced!!  Outback is half the price and double the great taste!!  I will not come back here."}
{"text":"We were there about 2 hours ago. The food was very good. The service was excellent. The place was absolutely dead at 8 pm. Maybe 5 tables, with two parties of 10-12. 

A message to the \"regional manager\" who must have walked past our table about 10 times and didn't stop to say a word to us, but stopped at the table next to us three times- Never judge a book by it's cover. Will be dining elsewhere next time based on this alone. I was told he was going on vacation and was checking in to make sure things were okay. They're not."}
{"text":"Great service and staff but not impressed with the food. Compared to the other locations the ribs don't taste like much and the fries were soggy. Three of us ordered the Lobster risotto... it was reminicent of Uncle Bens instant rice with watery sauce and practically no taste. My advise to the \"chef\", look up the definition of risotto on Wikipedia."}
{"text":"One of my favorite rib places in Calgary.  I am a fan or their baby back ribs along with their fries.  

Try the ribs and tell me that you don't like them.  : )"}
{"text":"Just generic. Not horrible, however nothing that takes your breath away."}
{"text":"Used to be better. Cold soups 
Coffee taste like burnt 
Steak is average quality. 
This place is getting old. Dust, spider webs everywhere. Sticky floors in bathroom. 
Won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"All time favorite steak house hands down. My family and I had a phase of coming here about once a week and we were pleasantly satisfied every single time. The service and staff is excellent, they're hospitable, attentive and very accommodating. They make sure your dining experience is as perfect as possible. The food also arrived to our table in a timely manner and it was delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly, was packed with flavor, tender and moist. Their steak is the cliche epitome of \"melts in your mouth\". Everything from the apitizers to the desert was flawless. I highly recommend calling in advance for reservations because this place fills up very quickly. Worth the 5 stars and will always be my go to steak house."}
{"text":"I had the ribs with shrimp with the cheddar cheese and mashed potato, thats really gigantic. As for the ribs, they taste really great. The bbq sauce for the ribs was magical. I had tasted the goat cheese from my friends plate, boy it just melts in your mouth. The place was ideal for a date night and with groups too."}
{"text":"Arrived close to 8pm and while the restaurant was full, there was no wait for a table for two. It's a good thing we knew what we wanted, however, as the only available menus were en français. I have a feeling this was due to the high occupancy of the restaurant as we've had English menus at this restaurant previously. 

We were served quickly, our waiter was polite and efficient.  I ordered a diet Pepsi that was served in a very small glass. If I received a number of refills, that wouldn't have been a problem, but my empty glass was simply whisked away and no refills provided. For $2.95 that's pretty unacceptable. 

The saving grace for this restaurant will always be is chicken tenders. I've declared them the world's best to anyone who will listen.  They are unique in their heavily applied, yet light and fluffy batter. The actual chicken is tender and juicy and I'm a fan of the accompanying barbecue sauce. 

Nobody went the extra mile as far as service is concerned. Very mechanical, no concern on refills, etc. This isn't to say the service was bad, it just wasn't great.  But if you order the chicken tender platter you shouldn't be disappointed. Those alone yield an extra star from me."}
{"text":"Food was edible. I guess in Canada everyone eats their burgers med well because we were not asked. Veggie sandwich very sparse on veggies and only one side with goat cheese. Early evening and out of sweet potato fries. Food slow to come out of kitchen. Perhaps the barbecue is better but would not return to find out as no redeeming features to make me want to try again."}
{"text":"The worst salad ever....you really deserve one star, but because of the positive and apologetic attitude the server had, I'll give you 2
I sent my salad back, because the lettuce was old and dry, the description red chopped egg and i got some specs of yolk, and prepackaged croutons... My girlfriend kept hers, fighting through the amount of soft batter covering the chicken.... The salad mix was the same as mine old and dry, she just drenched it in blue cheese dressing.
They took my salad off the check but I still walked out of there with a $27 check for a chicken salad, an ice tea and a coke...."}
{"text":"We came here for our dinner one evening and were seated in a fancy booth which has was nice and private and on the wall, had hooks to hang out coats which was a nice touch! Waitress was lovely and friendly and very attentive! I had chosen a lobster poutine to start, followed by a traditional burger with garlic mash and it was yummy! My fiancé had garlic mushrooms to start (it was too small a portion for him so he helped me eat my poutine as my portion was as big as a main, and looked more appetising), followed by steak and mash with roasted veg. Can't remember the specifics of the steak but the mash was beautiful, the veg, not so much.. And the steak was lovely! I also ordered a slice of red velvet, but didn't enjoy it! (Was my own mistake, the icing was marzipan which I don't like). And also the lunar eclipse cocktail is gorgeous if you're looking for somethin sweet! 
Atmosphere was relaxing and lights were dimmed.. Music in the background and it had a nice ambience to it! Would go back again :) free parking around the back and free wifi upon request of the password!"}
{"text":"Located right next to the Bell Center, it could be very difficult to find parking spot during events or work hours. The place is nice and service is good. I've been to several Baton Rouge restaurants, but ribs at this one are less tender and dryer than usual. You get a mountain of fries but they are ok, get the sweet potato fries instead.

I tried the Lobster Risotto for a change and it was terrible. Do not waste your money on that. There was more corn than rice, little lobster flavour."}
{"text":"Mon mari a voulu m'inviter dans ce restaurant lorsque nous avons appris ma seconde grossesse... nous etions accompagné de notre petit garcon de 3 ans.

Le service était horrible ! Pas un bonjour ni un sourire même quand notre petit bonhomme était poli et a gentiment dit bonjour a notre serveuse... qui elle ne s' est pas presenter.

Il y avait 4 choix indisponibles... 

J'ai pris du poulet,  très bon. 
Mon mari a pris du boeuf, la cuisson était pas la bonne... a 2 reprises !

Bref pas terrible.et cher pour ce que nous avons pris...

Je n'y retournerai pas"}
{"text":"Delicious food.  We ordered crab cakes, lobster risotto,  goat cheese rib eye and chicken tenders.  Everything came out fast and was very good.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"They started poorly when I asked for a quiet table and they put me in the bar directly under a speaker.  I asked to be reseated and they moved me to the dining room...out front...under a speaker.  Ordered iced tea and got a glass of what tasted like canned Lipton.  The side Ceaser salad was a good size but fairly salty.  I should have tried the mixed.  I ordered the Big Devil Burger with fries.  Still waiting for it to arrive.  Both the tea and water are long empty and the salad is long gone...  The wait staff is more interested in hanging around the hostess desk than waiting on me.
Burger and fries arrived.  Fries were hot.  Shoe string size, light salt - OK but not great.  The burger was a disappointment.  Dripping grease and still the bun was chewy.  I am not sure how they managed to drain the flavor out of bacon, cheese, 2 onion rings and the beef  patty but they did.  Next time I will go to the giant orange burger stand across the street.  Not coming back here.  You should not either."}
{"text":"Connected to our hotel so I can't evaluate the Parking situation, but we did eat there twice!  We enjoyed the outside dining during the festival which allowed us to people watch.   The first night we decided to try their spin on some mexican appetizers.  FAIL!  Lobster Quesedilla was dry and lacked cheese or anything else.  There were other good items and the wine was good.  We also enjoyed the Creme Brulee and several other desert items.  The waiter turned out to be the same waiter at the restaurant next door. Eggspectation!  I think they are somehow connected, but he was friendly enough and spoke in English when he realized we had no French under out belt.  
The next sitting was far more delicious.  Lobster roll, ribs, sweet potato fries were all made well.  Prompt service but the Old Fashioned cocktail wasn't the best I've ever had.  
The waiter even looked out for me as I left a shopping bag under my table.  He quickly swooped it up and saved it for me...."}
{"text":"This place has hit rock bottom since it's debut years ago .. terribly unqualified staff and horrible food .. I had so much love for BR but something has gone a stray lately .. I did give it a few tries but it's been getting worse if that's possible"}
{"text":"The ambiance is traditional steak house.  The food was sub par.  Steaks undercooked and not flavorful.  The garlic mashed potatoes were very mild and served luke warm.  Frank our server was nice and attentive.  Overall only worthy if it's the only place available."}
{"text":"January 6, 2017, we visited Baton Rouge, party of three. One of us had fish, and was quite pleased. One had ribs, and I had chicken fingers. I shared some with my rib friend, and he had the runs all night, and I began mine in the morning. We had absolutely nothing else in common in food or drink and it is hard to imagine another cause for our problems.
While the food and the service were indifferent but competent, the preparation of the food should really be looked into."}
{"text":"Här beställer du Ribs. Om jag förstod det rätt så görs de på spädgris från Danmark och min första tanke var då \"Varför gör inte danskarna smörrebröd med ribs om de nu har så förbaskad bra spädgrisar?\". En ganska trist och omodern lokal men helt enkelt väldigt bra ribs på tallriken. En lite roligare lokal och service så hade betyget hade varit högre."}
{"text":"As a tourist I struggled with having dinner at a chain restaurant much like those in the States. 

I wanted a real experience of authentic/local cuisine, but it wasn't half bad. I was pleasantly surprised. 

The staff was super attentive and friendly. A friendly staff goes a long way. Plenty of booths for large groups. Tables are spread so you're not hearing every detail of your neighbor's conversation. 

I have a weakness for fries - and I remember a heaping plate of fries that were fun to munch on with my meal."}
{"text":"Was surprised how much I enjoyed this place. My friends and I were comparing Baton Rouge to The Keg and it was surprisingly close. I had The Oscar- sirloin steak and lobster tail with sweet potatoes fries and baked potato. Everything was delicious. The lobster was just as good as the Keg and the steak was pretty darn close. The sweet potato fries were perfectly crispy and the baked potato was really nice. My fiancé had the ribs which were far better than the ribs at the keg (we find keg ribs can be dry) but the ribs at Baton Rouge were soft, slow cooked and fell off the bone nicely. Decor of the restaurant needs updating but overall, would recommend for a nice steak meal"}
{"text":"Took my wife here for her bday on Dec 5th. I had made reservations ahead of time and indicated it was her bday. The whole night, no one acknowledged this fact which I felt was quite disappointing. For the price, the food is horrible. They boast about their ribs and it was about as good as anything I could find in the supermarket.  The baked beans were stale, the fries soggy. The server did a good job."}
{"text":"I came here for adult beverages.   Service at the bar was amazing as was the atmosphere. Selection of alcohol was limited for a full bar, they could've had better selection of spirits and beer. The bar food was mediocre. Was hoping for better food in this type of establishment. My review is purely based on the bar experience and the bar food. I did not get a chance to eat from the full menu."}
{"text":"Been there a couple of times since my last review, and everything seemed to elevate into a higher level.

It is, in my opinion, the most fairly priced steakhouse in Montreal. It is not overpriced like most of the \"high-end\" places, and people shouldn't be paying more than 40$ a dish for steak anyway, unless it's Wagyu.

The service varies a lot with every visit, sometimes the servers are very friendly and caring, they come often to check if anything was okay and fill my water regularly. Other times, they're just there to bring you food, and then disappear into oblivion until you ask for the bill.

I go there for the food, and as long as the service is not terrible, I'm okay with that. So far, the food quality has always been top-notch. I slobber every time thinking about their steak, the portion is generous, meat is cooked perrrrrrrrrfectly, and seasoned extremely well. Not only their steaks are well cooked (consistent medium rare throughout), but the cut of the meat is also excellent, no sinews or any unchewable part. Always ask your steak to be rubbed with steak spices and topped with sautéed garlic, foodgasm at its best.

The ribs are not your average BBQ sauce ribs, you can actually taste the bourbon in them, and they fall off the bone easily but the meat is moist and tender. The tiger shrimp was slightly overcooked in my opinion, almost rubber-ish.

As for the sides, go for the coleslaw and the skillet beans, they look appetizing and taste even better. Bits of bacon and ground beef go very well with the skillet beans, and the sweetness of the beans compliments any meat dish altogether.

The ambiance is splendid, the place is great for any sorts of gatherings or even romantic dinner.

It is, after all, just a steakhouse. Their speciality is not fine cuisine like one would expect at Joe Beef or Toqué, but they are indeed very good at what they do."}
{"text":"I always thought this place was overrated but I was wrong. I got the chicken and ribs combo (~$29) dressed with the BBQ sauce. The chicken was so moist and the ribs were literally falling off the bone. I  got coleslaw and fries on the side and would definitely order these again. My wife ordered their classic top sirloin steak (~$27) made medium/rare and it was grilled to perfection. She had a generous portion of garlic mash on the side which was amazing, but her second side of seasonal veggies was a tad underwhelming. But this didn't take away from our delicious dinner - especially considering the American (BIG) size portions. 


On another positive note, the staff were friendly and even brought us out a complimentary dessert as we were celebrating a friend's engagement. Very nice of them - thank you!"}
{"text":"I like this place, it's like your in another city when venturing into Quarry Park. The BR Restaurant itself is pretty good too. I've been here three times now, and have had the full rack of ribs all three times. I guess you can say I'm a fan of the ribs here. They're fall off the bone tender. You wont need a knife to get at the meat. You literally just pull the bones apart and start eating (Yummy). I get them with fries, and slaw. I think you can order them with beans, apple something, or mashed potatoes, rice ? I'm not positive. I just keep invisioning the ribs, so I son't here the othe choices when the waiter rattles them off. I already have my mind made up. Fries and slaw, fries and slaw. Although I have to say, the coleslaw at Tony Roma's is better (creamier). On one particular occasion I went with the outlaws (inlaws). My Mother-inlaw, ordered the chicken and rib combo My father -inlaw ordered the prime rib. He finished his, also commented that it was very good and maybe one of the better tasting ones he's  had. The kids ordered off the the kids menu. which they also said was very tasty. All & all I would say this is one of my new favorite rib joints. Sorry Tony's, I may have found a replacemnent. (Maybe) ?"}
{"text":"They recently changed their menu, introducing many new dishes, as well as increasing their prices significantly.

I have to say, however, that my last experience here was just as great as before the change.

Call the swat team because that lobster poutine was the BOMB. Perfectly poached lobster with a rich, flavorful sauce, topped with spring onions and squeaky cheese curds, it was pure ecstasy.

The crab cake was really nice, cooked thoroughly, moist, and filled with an overwhelming amount of crab meat. The steak and ribs were great, as always.

The coleslaw was a shame, too much mayo and way too much sauce, my guess is that they ran out of cabbage that evening. The wild rice pilaf was very mediocre, and I could not finish it because it was so bland.

We did wait quite a while for food, maybe because the place was fully booked."}
{"text":"I went at this location for dinner. The vibe and atmosphere were good. The place itself is quite big and they have lot of seating.

The server was ok a bit on the rude side. The menu has lot of good options and I went with the Jewels of the sea and I truly enjoyed it. The meal came with 6 oz. lobster tail, grilled tiger shrimp, scallops, lobster bisque and I choose the meal with rice. 


Overall, Its another high end franchise. A bit pricey but an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Menu de game... Un peu decue :(

Le menu régulier n'était pas au rendez-vous. J'ai donc pris les ribs, mais j'aurais préféré une grosse salade ou un poisson. Bon... la prochaine fois ! Faut dire que cette location est tout près du centre Bell... donc souvent un show ou une game. Donc pas de réservation, ni de menu alléchant. BOUH. Le service était bien, mais on s'est senti un peu pressés de déguerpir car ils attendaient pour faire entrer le second service. 

A la prochaine !"}
{"text":"Hats off to this place! Has joined the list of my favourite steakhouses in the city. We ordered the rib steak and pork back ribs. Both were delicious! The rib steak was cooked to perfection with tons of flavour. And the pork back ribs were fall off the bone.... so fall off the bone you didn't even need to use your fingers (fork and knife will do). Service was also really great here. 

The only downside to this place is the tv's. They have a few by the bar that are really small. So it's hard to watch a game at a table or booth sitting so far away from a tiny tv. Unless you sit right at the bar."}
{"text":"Had the Ribs and shrimp, I actually ordered the ribs and chicken tenders, they got it wrong oh well, it was good not great, my friend had the seafood platter with lobster tail. The best thing out of our meal was the spinach dip sadly . Though my friend really enjoyed the seafood. Too expensive for a meal that barely met my satisfaction."}
{"text":"J'aime la viande... un peu trop d'ailleurs. C'est la raison pour laquelle j'allais au Bâton Rouge avant. Parce que tout le monde parlait de leur côtes levés extraordinaires. 

Avec l'expérience d'autres steakhouses et de plusieurs côtes levés, celles du Bâton Rouge sont... passables. Il existe plusieurs restos du même types avec de biens meilleurs ribs. 

Pour ce qui est de l'ambiance et la décoration, rien à dire... et l'emplacement est super."}
{"text":"Amazing for a first date or dinner with friends. I've seen many people go to the bar area to watch hockey games as well. 
Great atmosphere and friendly staff. I really enjoyed my chicken dish and salad. Desserts are delicious too."}
{"text":"You may say because this was a graduation party night out I am giving the fifth star! My experience was indeed a 5-star one. Very nice place, huge round table for the 14 of us, super polite and helpful staff and of course delicious food. My NY Steak (Contre-filet NY) was just medium rare as ordered and went well with the sangria. Good place good company good food what else do i need? I would definitely come back sooon! Before I forget if you happen to be here make sure you try the spinach dip IT IS HEAVENLY!!"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service. But, the place was pretty empty (40% full) on a Friday evening.
Food was good (I ordered a steak) and I would return here."}
{"text":"I'm surprised whenever people tell me that this is their favorite restaurant.. 

I mean, the food is good and everything, but it's really nothing special. The food can vary from great to bland, and the service is not always good...They can be quite slow..

The prices are ok, but you really do get what you pay for here. Just a middle range, nothing special restaurant.."}
{"text":"This Bâton Rouge, right across from Place-des-Arts, has a great location if you're someone who likes festivals in the summer or Luminothérapie (light & sound installation) in the winter. 

Food is okay. We've been twice (mainly because it was convenient and we were hungry). My steak has always been perfectly cooked, veggies nice and crunchy. My husband has tried two different chicken dishes and neither one of them was great. With two mains and two non-alcoholic drinks our bill was over $60 (tax & tip included) and for this money you can get much better food at many other restaurants...so I guess we're paying for the location.

Service was fast, friendly & bilingual. I like that they put a pepper grinder at each table instead of a shaker.

Carpets are showing some wear & tear and bathrooms were pretty gross -- not something I expected in what aims to be a nicer restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to the Oakville location because I had received a gift card.  Checked out their website to look over the menu. On arriving at the restaurant found they were closed due to renovations. Remembered visiting a Mavis  Rd. location and drove through heavy rush hour traffic to find that location was gone. Would have saved a lot of effort if the website had mentioned the renovations at the Oakville location."}
{"text":"Un service excellent avec des serveurs et serveuses très à l'écoute. Nous avons pris un plat de saison à base de homard. Très bon, juste un gros défaut, le plat était tiède, cela a beaucoup gâché...et aussi le prix. Je trouve toujours les plats chers au vu de la quantité à Montréal."}
{"text":"Went for family bday; had the cowboy steak 20 ouncer; always have rare and they made it PERFECTLY; the cook has made it right every time I go there so they know how to cook steaks properly; had their signature garlic mashed and my meal was perfect; waitress Ashley was awesome, attentive friendly and made everyone feel welcome; 

There are only about 2 places that can make a rare steak properly and this location does it right!"}
{"text":"Huge servings, welcoming staff, beautiful location!

I am a big fan of baton rouge, and this has to be my favourite location. My boyfriend and I made a reservation thinking that on a Friday night the restaurant might be packed. Fortunately this location is beyond spacious and when we requested a quiet space they placed us in a separate room with only one other table of diners. Despite being hidden away in a quiet area, we were checked on often. Food was fantastic and our waiter was not afraid to make recommendations for us. A minor mistake was made with my dinner (an accommodation I asked for that is not typical) and they not only fixed it for me with a fresh new plate, they also removed the item from the bill. 

I am under the impression that they have closed down for some renovations, but that they will be open again soon. Once they open back up, I will be going to see the changes and delight in the amazing experience again."}
{"text":"Cajun fries were good and everything else was disappointing. This is what I expected anyways from a chain restaurant. The seafood, steak and Cajun food didn't cut it. When will they bring a bubba gump shrimp to Canada."}
{"text":"Assez cher mais les entrées, les plats principaux, les boissons et les accompagnements sont excellents, l'endroit est chic et est super bien situé ! Le service est assez bien, j'adore !!"}
{"text":"This place has great servers & great spinach dip & sweet potato fries but that's about it. I went here twice in a 3 day period for lunch, as I was staying at a hotel nearby. I tried all 3 salads on the menu and something was definitely off. The chicken seemed undercooked both times & the shrimp was a bit hard. The chicken Caesar salad had way too much pepper. The portions are large but there's more carrots in the dish than anything else so it tasted terrible. No balsamic dressing as an option either ... strange. 
However, I was part of a group of 15 and those who had burgers and ribs were happy with their dishes, which is why we chose to go back the second time. Perhaps they just have to work on their salads."}
{"text":"Just left the restaurant and will definitely not go back. To start we ordered tea because it's cold outside, the \"hot\" water was lukewarm. We asked of they could turn the a/c down (other customers also had sweaters on), our waitress asked the manager and we saw him make motions as if \"wtf are they talking about?\" 
Our apps were fine...crab cakes were actually good. Our mains however were disappointments. One meal the Lobster Ravioli \"special\" was not hot as though it was fresh, and the taste was off and we sent it back. The Big Devil Burger didn't seem to be what was really on the menu; you couldn't taste they sauce on the burger at all and it was very dry only half was eaten. The waitress did not apologize once for anything. And we had to check the bill to ensure she removed at least the lobster dish from the bill. Just bad service overall, despite it starting decently."}
{"text":"Too long to be served! And the say: \"It won't take long...\". It is also noisy and expensive compared to places with the same type of food. The food is ok. Regular"}
{"text":"Real nice ambiance. Meals were good but the waiter was excellent. He upsold us at a cheaper price than ala carte   Would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"What horrible tasting food. Literally tastes like reheated food!! Buying frozen would have been worth our money, not this place!! We made reservations for a belated Mother's Day lunch.  We used to go here for ribs all the time (when we lived in the area) and wanted my mom and mother in law to try. We ordered the ribs and chicken tenders today and it just wasn't what it used to be.  Super super dry and flavor was lacking. ...so much so that we could barely finish our meal and all left with a doggy bag.  The fries were the only good thing on my plate.  Not only was our meal not up to parr but the service was just unacceptable.  I overheard the manager and waitress arguing for several minutes- for anyone to hear.  At one point our waitress seemed to disappear- but I later realized she was covering several sections. we had to request for our bill from the hostess, and even still, we had to wait a ridiculous amount of time.  At that point a manager should have come by or done something to help.  Felt bad for our waitress. Never returning here."}
{"text":"The interior of this place looks like ponderosa and Flemings had a love child. The menu and the food styling is reminiscent of outback, however the food is better tasting. I had the prime rib and it was excellent. There was a long line to get in however they offer free hors d'oeuvres and champagne while you wait."}
{"text":"If this is your favourite restaurant, you need to get out more. 

We had ribs and Amarillo chicken - the ribs were the blandest ribs I've ever had, and my Amarillo chicken tasted like a piece of chicken had been thrown in the oven, with a slice of processed cheese dumped on top. The seasoned vegetables were 3 sprigs of broccoli, 2 pieces of mini corn and 1 carrot stick. The service was helpful where possible, but they had far too many tables to look after to provide real service. We had to flag down the server every time."}
{"text":"We had a group booking to celebrate a good friend's birthday the other night. They moved us 3 times claiming that the tables are booked for other groups already. I felt so bad for my friend, it was her birthday and she was very unhappy about it especially that the manager was very unfriendly and he seemed like he just does not care. The food was ok but who cares after such a bad customer service. Normally, you would expect a better service especially for a group of 8 but the lack of interest on the manager's part made us feel like nothing. Thanks Baton Rouge for ruining our eve."}
{"text":"It's not what it used to be. You're getting ripped off at Baton Rouge now. You're paying more money for less food (quality and quantity)! They try to fool you by putting less food in bigger dishes. They also go rid of the cheese bread. The ribs are smaller and have way less meat on those bones. Prices went up and i'm getting less. I don't think so....
I'm done with them."}
{"text":"Rip-off.
They recently changed their menu and raised the prices BUT they also now give you less food. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"You're getting ripped off at Baton Rouge these days. Higher prices for less food. AND no more cheese bread! I've had my last meal there! Go eat elsewhere, there's no more value or quality there."}
{"text":"I was surprised how empty it was for a Friday night. 

We were a group of 4 and the server and his trainee seemed to forget about us. We would ask him for something and then 15 minutes later he would remember."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and by the second time I wished I had picked another place for lunch. Two stars are for somewhat decent service. Our server both times was pleasant but did the bare minimum. Just served us and left without checking up on us about the quality of the food etc. It was a moot point to check on the quality of the food anyway as there wasn't any. Very mediocre and tasteless food in general. Never to return to any Baton Rouge locations ever again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I made a last minute reservation yesterday (New Year's Eve) we got there at 9:45 and was seated quickly. It took a while to get our drink orders because there was a few big groups around us. We received our drink orders, ordered our main and waited. The wait was worth it because it was delicious, our waitress was very knowledgable. I had the filet mignon with garlic mash and my boyfriend had the ribs with fries and slaw. Honestly, it was delicious, cooked perfectly and to perfection. Even though it wasn't that big of a portion, I was very full and satisfied. I would definitely go back. Oh, leave room for desert because the cheesecake and red velvet are to die for."}
{"text":"Only order ribs here....they are the best. Restaurant is respectable and service is great."}
{"text":"El servicio fue muy bueno, las costillas tenían un excelente sabor , la ensalada estaba rica pero los cócteles no estaban muy ricos. El restaurante no tiene Parqueadero fin de semana solo entre semana."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this location on a Saturday evening. I jumped online and made a reservation, and I'm glad that I did. We arrived right on time and were seating immediately. The restaurant was busy, but our server was just the right amount of attentive. Didn't badger us every 5 seconds, but also made sure we had all that we needed. The steaks that we ordered were cooked perfectly to our specifications (medium) and it arrived quickly. The calamari appetizer was also good. I appreciated the fact that the server came to check and see if our steaks were cooked to our liking. We hadn't had a chance to try the steak yet as we started off with the mashed potatoes and vegetables. She said she would come back in a few minutes to check with us again...and that's exactly what she did. Even if the food wasn't great (which it was) I'd still come back because of the amazing customer service"}
{"text":"Gone there so many times lost count but friendly staff, food is always good my only issue is why did they reduce the baked potato sizes and the chicken sizes too because I always get the same items on the menu always I love that they have me goat cheese on the side without charging me extra! Class act"}
{"text":"Gone there so many times lost count but friendly staff, food is always good my only issue is why did they reduce the baked potato sizes and the chicken sizes too because I always get the same items in the menu! Nice Reno"}
{"text":"Went last night for dinner and it was okay.  It was just four of us and we ordered the cheddar dip as an app.  The dip was warm and the fried tortillas tasted as if they were stale.   I ordered the steak and it was done nicely but my fries were warm and soggy looking.  Everyone at the table got sweet potato fries and they were amazing and piping hot compared to my sad looking fries."}
{"text":"Je suis une habitué de la place... je vais là au moins 2 fois par mois et j'y retourne toujours (ou presque, car j'aime essayer les autres délices de leur menu, assez varié d'ailleurs) pour leurs FABULEUSES ET OH! COMBIEN DELICIEUSES, TENDRES ET JUTEUSES Côtes levées... Toujours la cuisson parfaite... et les à cotés feront des heureux:  patates frites (croustillantes et garnies de paprika et poivre); patate au four; salade de chou, fèves poilées.... à vous le choix! 
Les plats ici sont généreux et l'ambiance est pas mal non plus.  Ce que j'apprécie également est la qualité du service de leurs serveurs, (il n'y a pas qu'un serveur assigné à votre table, le GROS avantage et que l'attente et minime... car dès qu'un serveur se libère il vient vous voir!) Pour les personnes à la «dent sucrée», sachez que la carte de desserts ne vous décevra pas, vous offrant des gâteaux variés, des portions généreuses et toujours frais... reste à voir si vous ne serez pas trop plein...
S'il s'agit de votre première visite au Baton Rouge, il faut essayer leurs côtes levées, vous ne le regretterez pas!"}
{"text":"Excellent ribs, a very good choice of wines and the apple cobbler was great, service was very good."}
{"text":"We went as a group, sat in the basement. Wait 2 hours for any good to come up. Very very slow service. And also there's flies."}
{"text":"Food and wine were delicious! We had the ribs, filet mignon, and the lobster poutine. The staff was also very friendly."}
{"text":"This is a decent take on American food.  They have a fairly diverse menu of different kinds of meats and sides.  A lot of your typical American fare- pork ribs, mashed potatoes, etc.  The food is flavorful, but prices are a bit steep for what you're ordering when you consider a lot of it is basic US offerings served at Canadian sized portions.  But with the fun atmosphere and friendly service, it's a nice place to eat next time you're in Complexe Desjardins."}
{"text":"I love Baton Rouge. Love the food and service. Chicken Tenders for me, Ribs for my wife and salad for my mother in law. My daughters love the pasta and whatever the spice they put on the fries is delicious. 

Been going for 10 years but this past weekends what got me excited to post a review. Walked in, alone with my 1 year old and 3 year old daughter. For me this means lets get this done and quick. First, the hostess helped me carry my two seater up the stairs, then they moved they cutlery away from my daughters, seems like a no-brainer but I am always surprised at how often waiters place the steak knives in front of the kids. 

The waitress took my order quickly, brought the food quickly, stopped at my table every three minutes to play with the kids and clean up the sugar packs my daughter was throwing. Extra plates and napkins kept coming and they ran to help carry the stroller back down the stairs when i left. 

I was a bit nervous going into the restaurant without my wife but it turned out to be a piece of cake due to the five star service. Oh, and the food was great too. My one year old polished the whole bowl of lobster mac and cheese herself. 

Highly recommended restaurant food and service and definitely kid friendly."}
{"text":"little disappointed, I just  bought  a tske out, I espicially told them  no salt  , only  black pepper, but when  I eat it,  it tast very salty ...... so I can only eat the veges besides now  .........
I hope they could really listen client's need, when I says  no salt really  means no salt  !!"}
{"text":"The salmon was bland - no salt, no pepper. No seasonings at all. I had salmon because I returned a steak because it was not cooked properly. The ribs were good. Will not have steak from this restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"Mmm... ribs!  According to their website, Baton Rouge is known for their ribs, and I have to say that they're pretty tasty.  Fall-off-the-bone tender, there was just the right amount of bbq sauce on the ribs which I had served with a generous helping of thick cut steamed veggies.  I wasn't over the moon, but I felt they were tastier than some of the fair-winner bbq ribs I've had.  Next time I would want to try out their tuna steak salad.

The restaurant exterior looks like a mansion, so I wasn't sure what to expect on the inside - I certainly wasn't expecting the small parking lot to be completely full!  The interior is all dim lighting and rich dark browns and reds.  It's a nice, safe, intimate and impressive enough place for an early-on date.

Dessert was an apple cobbler which was mediocre at best and I might have imagined a bit of freezer burn.  Skip dessert and go for the drinks!"}
{"text":"Excellent service en cette post-réouverture. La qualité de la nourriture était déjà excellente avant les rénovations. L'endroit est maintenant bien plus convivial et le service est irréprochable. 

Je n'ai honnêtement que très rarement eu un aussi bon service. Wow, félicitations à l'équipe. 

Aussi à noter que c'est délicieux."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for the last 9 years off and on. It's always been very nice for us."}
{"text":"Attached to the Hyatt Regency in Montreal, I cannot believe that the concierge suggested this place. Why, why, why would anyone eat here? Because they're desperate, that's why. Traveling for work and just looking for a decent meal. The food was edible. Note to self, don't set your expectations too high. Only order steak & potatoes. The suggested wine tasted like when we put ice cubes in the cheap box wine on a hot summer day. Except it wasn't hot, or summer, or daytime. Highly suggest avoiding BR at all costs, unless Applebees-Canada is your thing. And don't get me started about the management..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a mixed bag. I ordered the prime rib with fries and apples. Everything was done well. Service was excellent on a Saturday night with no event at the adjacent Bell Centre. 

The problem was with the 21$ shrimp cocktail appetizer. The 5 shrimp served were clearly purchased by the restaurant precooked and frozen. This is unforgivable in any eating establishment or home for that matter. You can tell this right away as the shrimp had no elasticity and were slightly mushy. It's not rocket science to purchase fresh seafood and prepare it properly. For some reason, the shrimp were served on a plate instead of on ice. Even more bizarre was the chef's sprinkling of dried herbs on top. 

While the rest of the meal was good, my wife noted that the bill including a bottle of wine reached 225$ for 2 people. \"We could have just gone to Gibby's\"  She's absolutely right. If you are going to call yourself a steakhouse and fail to match up to the gold standard in Montreal, you better be selling your product at a substantial discount which is not the case at Baton Rouge.  Next time we'll stick to a burger or ribs."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Baton Rouge (the Thornhill location) but decided to have dinner with a couple of friends at the Scarborough location. Such a horrible location! I don't know if it's management or what, but, everything was different for some reason. 

My friends and I always end up ordering appetizers at the Thornhill location and we decided to do the same at the Scarborough location. We always order the same thing, the spinach nacho dip - and so we did! However, when the appetizer came out, it was 1/2 the serving size of the one we get from the Thornhill location, and it was the same price. 

However, the exact same thing happened with our meals. Keep in mind, the prices are pretty expensive, but, you truly get what you pay for ONLY at the Thornhill location, NOT at the scarborough location. Our fries were SO little compared to what we usually get. I always end up having to take some home with me for the next day. However, at this location, the fries were so little! We ended up also ordered an additional side of dip for the fries. We never get charged extra for this dip but at this location we did.

We ended up asking about the portion of the fries and later, our waitress brought us a plate of fries and apologized, except we never knew she was charging us for it! it was her idea to bring it out for us. Once we got our bill, we complained and they made us pay for it. 

Baton Rouge in general is a great restaurant, but this location was horrible!"}
{"text":"You may ask yourself when you see this review, \"Hey, why did Andrew give this place only 2 stars?\", well let me answer that. I decided to give this place a try, when a friend and I wanted something to eat at 9pm, we chose the nearest place, because we we're tired. The only regret I have was not checking this place out on Yelp on my phone, if you haven't had the app yet downloaded, go do it. 

Let me start with the pros, first of all it has a nice little outdoor sitting area looking into Place des Arts. They also had very lovely and helpful staff. These are the only two things I can think about that is positive in my experience at this place. 

The food could have been better....much better. I ordered the tomato soup which was the soup of the day, it tasted kinda bland. In addition, I had the spinach dip that was, just okay. It wasn't fully disgusting that I would want to stop, it just it could have been better. The servings were just too big, nothing special about the dishes that made me want to go back, it was just...not good. There are better restaurants around, that I would pick over this any day. 

They didn't have very many vegetarian dishes as well, they had a couple, I would seriously suggest them to beef up their menu with a couple more signature vegetarian dishes. I would say, they should revamp their whole menu, and re-do their dishes to make it stand out. This place has so much potential, I thought it would be good because it was under the Hyatt regency, but I wouldn't go back until they relaunch into something better. So please, take my advice Baton rouge."}
{"text":"Pour moi le Baton Rouge Anjou est l'essence même de ce qu'est le service efficace. On vous prends en charge à l'arrivée et ont ne vous laisse pas tombé du repas. Oui, ça reste un délicatessen de luxe, mais la qualité y est. Que ce soit des côtes levées, aux sandwich à la côte de boeuf en passant par les différents poissons, soyez assurez que la qualité y sera et que vous serez servis de manière courtoise et efficace. Cependant, notez bien que tout les Baton Rouge ne sont pas créée égaux."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to have dinner at Baton Rouge after spending the day at Montreal en Lumiere. My husband had been there once before and wasn't thrilled by the food, but as soon as he mentioned crab cakes, I was sold. I grew up on the east coast in the States and seafood was a staple growing up. Unfortunately, that visit will likely be my last. 

The restaurant is nice. very clean, cozy... great atmosphere and good music. Our waiter was fantastic (I forget his name, though). We had our 2.5 year old son and daughter who was just a few weeks old at the time. I assume because of our kids, we were given a booth on the side of the restaurant in the corner. I enjoyed where we were placed because I didn't have to worry about my kids disturbing other diners and I could nurse my daughter freely without offending anyone. Our son was given crayons and a children's menu to write on... he even received a free scoop of ice cream after his meal. Unfortunately, our food was subpar. 

My husband ordered the steak, which he had during another dinner date but didn't like. Why he ordered it again, I don't know but at least he learned that the steak was consistently not great. The crab cake that I so craved was just ok. There were more \"other\" ingredients than crab in the cake... typical, and I shouldn't have really expected more, but I did. I enjoyed the calamari appetizer but my husband said the pieces he chose were cold. I ordered the crab risotto (it's usually a lobster risotto but they were out of lobster that day) and I was not pleased. It came with several huge chunks of imitation crab meat. Ugh. For the price of the dish ($25+), I expected real crab... at least some real crab. It also came filled with bright yellow corn (like the kind that comes out of a can or freezer bag and not off the cob) and the rice didn't really seem like arborio. I ate the dish (minus the imitation crab meat), so it wasn't terrible, but I definitely wasn't delicious. I don't recommend it.  

Overall, I'd say the restaurant's menu is overpriced for food that's just OK.

If you're a steak or seafood lover like my husband and I, you're best to choose a restaurant with a higher quality menu."}
{"text":"Enjoyed baby back ribs & Chipolte chicken entrees , both were great! Service was fantastic too our server was the only one there and he did it all with finesse, class and enjoyment!  There were four other parties he served and bar tended too, hats off to him !! I'm sorry I didn't write his name down.  He truly added to fantastic experience at Baton Rouge."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Proper portions with a good vibe. Great for groups. Lunch time does get busy."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend were up for a Bruins vs. Habs game weekend, and decided on this location for dinner the first night.

I'm happy to say that it didn't disappoint.  When we arrived, around 6pm, the hostess told us that there would be about a half-hour wait.  So we put our name in and grabbed a couple seats at the bar.  We got a round of drinks and had a very nice conversation with a couple that was in town from Quebec City.  About 20mins later we were informed that our table was ready.  I always like a place that, not only can give you an accurate wait time, but even get to you quicker then they quoted.

Normally when at Baton Rouge I get the ribs, but this night I really didn't feel like eating with my hands.  So I went with the 8oz Filet Mignon with a side of garlic mashed potatoes with chopped smokehouse bacon.  It was cooked exactly how I wanted it and the potatoes were much more flavorful then I had expected.  I usually find sides at chain restaurants to be an afterthought, and treated as such.  But these were a very pleasant surprise.  My girlfriend got the Louisiana BBQ Chicken with a baked potato for her side.  Although I can't personally comment on the tastes, she was overall very pleased with the meal, and made a few comments about wanting to come back next time we're up in Montréal.

The decor was very nice.  The table we had felt intimate, despite being around booths of 5-6 people.  Our server was friendly and helpful, especially when it came to explaining the specials, different meals, and helping my girlfriend pick out her wine."}
{"text":"I went to this location for a pre-game dinner, before heading over to the Bell Centre for a Bruins vs. Habs game.  

The place was pretty packed with fans that had the same idea as us.  Our group was a mix of 3 Habs fans and 2 Bruins fans (myself included).  We figured it would be best to have one of the Montreal fans go put her name in for the table.  No need being skipped over, if the hostess happens to be a serious fan.  We had a 20 minute wait which I thought was very reasonable given how close we were to the Bell Centre and how many people were already there.  I grabbed us a round at the bar and we were able to look over the menu while we waited.  Which helped.

We were seated in about 15 minutes.  Again, pretty impressive on the turn around they have there.  Because we had already looked at the menu at the bar we were able to put our full order in right away.  Which the waitress appreciated.

I had the 1/2 rack of ribs and 1/2 grilled chicken with fries... The ribs were your standard \"Baby Back\" style pork ribs.  They weren't very \"fall off the bone\" but the meat was tender enough.  It wasn't too tough or hard to chew, which can be common in chain restaurants, due mostly to over-cooking.  These were just fine, on par with some of the packaged ribs you can find in the super markets (example: Lloyd's, Curley's, etc.).  The sauce was on the sweeter side... and they made sure to not drown the ribs, so you could still taste the meat.  As for the chicken... the taste was a nice smokey contrast to the sweetness of the sauce on the ribs.  But like most of these types of meals, the meat did get a little dry the further in you went.

I'd give the waitress high marks due to the fact that she was clearly slammed, but made sure we always had our drinks when we needed another round and even was lighthearted enough to do some friendly Montreal/Boston trash-talking.

I would definitely put this on the list of places to grab a sit down meal before a game at the Bell Centre or if you go on a bit more of a quiet night.  It's perfectly fine for a casual date night."}
{"text":"Mardi Gras special $25 for app, main, and dessert. Great deal!  Louisiana salad was crispy greens with ice cold deep fried battered onions.  The onions would have been tastier if hot and crispy instead of fridge damp chewy.  BBQ ribs were smoky and tender.  Seafood linguine was delish.  Large tiger shrimps and huge scallops cooked perfectly.  Service was attentive."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful, my cowboy steak was cooked to perfection, my Gf lobster tail was cooked Great. Loved this place"}
{"text":"Lobster was very good. The wine that waitress recommended, Smoking Loon, was delicious and went really well with steak. Could not find the wine in SAQ app though."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday at 630. Waited half an hour until we were seated near the bar which was fine. We were just hungry so it didn't matter where we sat.

JUST TO SET THE SCENE: by now it's 7pm. Happy Hour is over so the place is not that packed. Empty tables here and there. 

The waitress gave us our menu and water and left. The menu was in french so we asked her for English ones. She took the French ones and never returned. We waited a good 15 minute until we had to ask the bustboy to get us menus which she did promptly.

It took another 15 minute for the waitress to come and take our orders. We got the prime rib and the lobster risotto. The food came out very fast surprisingly.

The prime rib was a decent piece. No complaints.
The lobster risotto had a good amount of lobster chunks. But holy cow. Why is there corn?! There were more corn then there were risotto. I couldn't taste anything but corn.

The waitress filled everyone's cup with water except ours which was clearly empty.  Even the table right beside ours got water! She clearly didn't like English speaking people or Asians. Rude.

We finished our meals and waited 20min for her to come and take it away. She offered dessert menu and we waited another 20 minute until she came back and took our order of creme brulee. Once we ordered, she came back so quickly to give us our bill. We didn't even get our dessert yet!

The creme brulee was good but nothing special. 

We hesitated to give her any tip but we're nice people so she still got her 15%. But gosh, this is why I hate french people. She's bringing them all down!

OVERALL: food is mediocre. Which sucks for the price that you're paying. Service is horrendous. wouldn't come back again. If you have a choice, opt for the food court downstairs!"}
{"text":"For years, it has been my family's favorite steakhouse (three locations, we have been on Sainte Catherine, De La Montagne and Decarie). 

The restaurant is huge. It has always a cozy feeling. The service always has been good. Never had any issues with any of the staff.

Best comfort food. My sisters, one had her all time favorite the chicken tenders with garlic mashed potatoes; and she always asks for the pepper sauce without charge; second sister had Baton Rouge burger, which she devoured it. I had steak and fries which I asked for medium rare. You know what, it was cooked perfectly! Then, three of us, ordered peanut butter brownie cake to share. It was a huge portion; every layer of this cake super delicious. 

The price is a bit of high though... all steakhouses are... but the food is comfortingly delicious."}
{"text":"Location: Close to the outlet shops. Parking is available and free. 

The place: I've been here several times before and I guess I forgot to write a review because the place just doesn't blow me away. Anyway, as with all other Baton Rouge restaurants, the decor is the cookie cutter style - dark, wood, windows. They've got booths and tables. The ambiance is OK.

The goods: So first of all, let's keep in mind that while I'm no food expert, I eat out a fair amount in Montreal, and since I spend a decent amount of time in the Laurentians, I've had the opportunity to try many restaurants in the area (St. Sauveur, specifically). The food here, is mediocre. On this visit, I ordered a burger - the patty was burnt. I don't know how one burns a burger patty but there you have it. Compared to say, Burger Royale or Notre Boeuf de Grace, this burger was also about half the size for almost double the price. OK sure, there were a few fries thrown in - but my burger was burnt and a tad dry. Toppings were nothing to write home about and the sauce was barely existent. My mom had the beef burger (this was slices of beef or something to that effect) and she liked it. My dad ordered steak and thought it was fine but the portion? Laughable for the price. The last time we came here, my parents both had ribs and were very disappointed because all they could taste was sugar - that's how sweet the rib sauce was. All this to say that this place CAN be beat. There are other smaller, non-chain restaurants in the area that offer pretty good food for the price. For example, there's a Greek restaurant in the heart of the village that makes great, home-cooked food.

Service: Good. 

Price point: Overpriced - I think for three people, the total ended up being over $100 which to me, is laughable considering what we had, portion sizes and the fact that they charge $3 for a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Upscale area, nice enough restaurant but hardly anyone there on a Monday night at 6pm?
Went in for an appy and a drink. Impressed with the space but I am not sure how much care goes into it. The tables needed a good wipe, covered in salt and pepper near the wall. Menus still wet from either beer or being wiped down (I hope it was the latter!)
Drinks were good and there are many on special on Monday nights - Caesars and draft beer. Our waiter was our bartender as well. And we were not sitting at the bar!
Service was lackluster, slow and disconnected. These days if we get great service at a restaurant in Calgary we are surprised.
We shared an Ahi Tuna salad - $21, was worth maybe $9. Greens with maybe 4 carrot shavings could have been fresher and the fish was just OK (overcooked a bit). Dressing on greens and fish was good. The presentation of the dish was sub-par,  thrown on the plate with no thought behind it, no pride, no care. Tomatoes were pink in the height of summer. So wrong.
This place has so much potential but I can see why people avoid it and go elsewhere as the prices are just too high for what you get and service falls down here."}
{"text":"If you like to be ignored here's your place. 

Maybe its because my French is English, but often the waitresses/waiters turned the other cheek when passing my table. Funny thing is, there were very few clients given that it was a Wednesday night.

Don't waste your money ordering appetizers, especially the tacos...quite embarrassing....open pita bread with uncooked peepers and salad with 3 pieces of raw tuna.

Ordered a cocktail well in advance of ordering food, yet both arrived at the same time. When it was time to order a second drink of course I was non-existent to their staff. When I called out for a random waiter/waitress they assured me that someone will come see me, which evidently, turned out to being a lie. They were just quick in collecting the bill payment - record time.

$115 later I think the only occasion BR will ever see me again is if I'm with a bunch of French-speaking guys and I stick to beer, ribs and fries."}
{"text":"We don't usually go to chain restaurants, especially those in tourist towns like Saint Sauveur, but since we hadn't been to a Baton Rouge in about 5 years, we decided to try this one.

We were there for lunch on a Saturday and it was completely empty.    Service was good.   As we were using the lunch menu, the prices were better than at night.     Steak frites was actually very good - I had mine with garlic mashed potatoes, he had his with wild rice.   Soup came with the meal which was quite good.    Price was $17 per person - totally reasonable for a small flap steak meal.    

We'd go again for lunch."}
{"text":"Chain/franchise restaurants - I automatically expect each one to live up to their name as much as their name has a good or bad reputation.  Baton Rouge has always been a place with decent food and a good atmosphere.  The first one I ever went to was in Boucherville, QC years ago.  Since then they've been in Toronto for quite some time and even though I don't go too often to this place it is a nice treat when I do.

Of course when I come here I'm usually getting a steak since it's on that level or they try to be on that level with the most comparable restaurant (the Keg) and they come close but I have to still give it to the Keg over both Baton Rouge because of the level of service.  

My last visit to Baton Rouge while it was a group of over 20 I still felt like I had to chase down servers to get drinks.  At one point I had to stand up and flag one of them.  I couldn't really move from where I was sitting because I was up against a wall and we were cramped and it would have been hard to do so.

Besides the level of service not being up to the same standards as the Keg, I can say the food while good, just doesn't have the same flare to it.  It's hard to describe... little things like the salads at the Keg are served cold... not frozen but cold.  To me it seems like the servers are just more experienced at the Keg.  

I keep comparing BR to the Keg I know but it's because they are so alike.  I had ordered the rib steak and it was very good.  They don't ask you to cut into it and say whether or not it was cooked to my satisfaction and it's just those little things that separate BR from something that could be considered a different level of service.

To reiterate, I shouldn't have to ask for drinks... it should be the other way around.  Besides that the quality of Baton Rouge overall is decent and the service I would think is a more based on how each place is managed.  This one in Woodbridge could use a little refining IMO."}
{"text":"Baton rouge est une chaîne de restaurant présente au Québec. J'aime bien la carte et les grillades sont excellentes. Les assiettes sont énormes !

{"text":"I see absolutely no reason to go to this place. Amateur food preparation and menu design make for an incredibly uninspiring dinner that could easily - and I stress easily - be made at home.  This, of course, would be inconsequential if the service would be good. But it certainly was not.

We waited approximately 20 minutes to get our drink orders taken. Finally, we got around to ordering a few ceasars. 15 minutes later, our server came back to tell us they didn't have Clamato. That wouldn't have been a problem except for the fact that we had now been waiting 35 minutes without even water. OK fine, order another drink. Another 10 minutes pass and drinks are quickly dropped off and the order not taken. So we have already been here almost an hour and our order still is not taken. My fiancee orders some type of meat, admittedly I can't remember what, and I order the chicken for something different. They come back about 5 minutes later to tell us they don't have anymore of whatever it was my fiancee ordered, so she settles for NY strip.

When it finally came, food was absolutely terrible. Steak was seasoned quite poorly and was cooked in a bizarrely non-uniform fashion. We aren't picky steak eaters and will eat anything between rare and medium-well, though my preference is medium-rare. This steak was blue in parts, and well in parts, likely as a result of being a strange cut.  The chicken was beyond overdone and not edible.

I am not one to complain, and I tip despite almost any situation as you never know who's fault it is. In this situation,  I would have liked to see a discount for the incredibly poor service time and not having two out of our four menu selections.  

So, in the end, I didn't expect much from Baton Rouge and was served much worse than that.  I would avoid this like a plague. If you don't know how to properly grill a steak at home, I suggest you spend the time you would have spent waiting for your order, learning how to grill one and do it yourself at home."}
{"text":"While this is a \"franchise\", so to speak, its still the best place in the West Island for a celebration with a steak or ribs, without paying through the nose outrageously. The prices aren't cheap (a la Moe's Deli) but they are what you can expect from a higher-end steak house. The ribs are worth it too, and don't forget the all dressed basked potato which this establishment has mastered. I have never regretted a meal eaten there. Also a note for allergy sufferers, the fries are cooked in peanut oil, but they are very careful and sensitive to this allergy. Just let them know you have one when you order."}
{"text":"Baton Rouge is one of my wife's favorite places for ribs.  As far as restaurant chains go, they are quite good and I would highly recommend them. The food is high quality and the service is spectacular.   This, however is not the place to go if you are looking for a quiet evening as the restaurant is a bit loud.  All in all, a good choice for a casual evening."}
{"text":"In one word: inedible. I generally avoid chain restaurants that feel the need to advertise on television. I didn't want to go but we were meeting some people in the area who were at the Jazz Fest. Unfortunately, this area is largely a black hole for decent places to eat unless you want to venture down to Chinatown.  Because of its convenient location overlooking Place Des Arts, it draws a lot of the tourist/festival crowd and I can only imagine that this is the only way it can stay in business (but that doesn't explain why Baton Rouge is a fairly successful Quebec chain). I've never had worse \"cajun\" food (fake cajun)  from the appetizer nachos that came accompanied with a vile looking and even worse tasting garlic dip to the rubbery ribs, overcooked steaks, dripping-with-grease sandwiches, and soggy french fries. Alas, the food is so bad, it made me regret passing by the St. Hubert chicken place right down the street (which is bad but not THAT bad). The sad thing is: for the same price you can actually eat at a decent restaurant."}
{"text":"A very decent food hub to bring a ribs lover to.

Friendly service.
Low key decor.
And of course sports are displayed on TVs all over.

Lobster season makes for a very tasty bisque, l'd say go eat some before it's gone.
One little negative: they overcooked my hubby's steak, but they handled that swiftly.

Not mind blowing, but surely good enough to (re)visit."}

I have even been there for lunch and the roast beef sandwich with Au jus is amazing!"}

We ordered the calamari & stuffed mushrooms. These mushrooms were much bigger than the Keg's! They had weight to them and I love that they come in 4. (Canyon creek serves apps in 3s). The calamari wasn't greasy like a lot of places. The dipping sauce was so good. 
Our mains were the Oscar steaks and they were delicious! The mashed potatoes were very creamy. Everything tasted great! 
Service was excellent. The down side is that the bathrooms are downstairs. I had on heels. I didn't struggle or anything by any means, it just may be an issue for some people. 
I said I'd return for drinks & apps. I'd love to sit on their patio next time."}

{"text":"I have been to many of the Baton Rouge chains across montreal. This was my first time visiting the one in Gallerie des Anjou and it was a good experiece. The waitress was very kind. We went on a Saturday night so service was quite slow. We got our food pretty late but the waitress was very nice and came by to apologize and went to check what was the hold up. I ordered the atlantic salmon with garalic mashed potatoes. The salmon was not that well seasoned and did not taste any garalic in mashed potatoes. The winning point of the night was the dessert. I had the Chocolate Mousse and it was to die for. It was delicious and we were given such a big portion. Overall, I was not that impressed with my meal but it wasn't a bad experience."}
{"text":"Wow well this was unexpected...

1. Post renovation the  place looks great 4/5. Looks great but- Booths are way too close to one another...

2. The service at the front when being seated 2/5 unpleasant staff. Eye rolling attitude.

3.The food quality for the price 2/5. Same selection, terrible fries (NOT GLUTEN FREE AS THEY ARE FRIED WITH THR SWEET POTATO FRIES WHICH ARE DUSTED IN FLOWER!!, RIBS MARKED AS GLUTEN FREE- but are NOT! DUE TO GLUTEN IN THE BBQ SAUCE! Which apparently was always there!!!  but was served as GF!! They claim it had a small amount so it's fine... WELL ACTUALLY NO! It's very dangerous to serve an allergen to those who ARE ALLERGIC! (And FYI SOME PEOPLE DONT ALEAYS SHOW A REACTION RIGHT AWAY AND IT CAN CAUSE MORE SEVETE DAMAGE IN THR LONG RUN!!!!

3.The service 2/5. We were seated and waited for a good 15 minutes while another server noticed we were being completely ignored!
And came over to ask if we've been served... he took our order and eventually some young unhappy lady eventually took over- our question is why bother?!
The kids food arrived quickly - but never brought the drinks or refills! 



VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE STAFF! We feel the staff made our experience much worse then it could have been!
The food was ok.  Minus the gluten problem- and tasteless mash which I soaked in garlic butter -The seafood was good but portion is not shareable as described.
The decor is nicer then before.

**** post Reno and a huge expense, hidden away from all the busy popular restaurants across the street, one would think they would try a little bit harder to offer decent service!"}

But this Baton Rouge in particular is prob the worse one I've been too.

The positive is the hostess was very nice and seemed genuinely welcoming. That's pretty much all the positive.

The negatives were that the waiter seemed very fake (and made it obvious that he wanted a Tip). He rarely filled our glasses up (unless we asked him ). The food portions were small (compared to other Baton Rouge). 

Overall a crappy experience and will not be going back to this Baton Rouge again."}
{"text":"Rated 4 out of 5 stars against other chain sit-down restaurants.


This Baton Rouge is my favourite Baton Rouge location. The food is fresher, more care is taken into preparing the dishes, and the service is friendly and top notch. Moreover, I like this location because of the uniqueness of the place. Built in a remodelled farm house it is quint, stylish, and feels like something so much better than the area it is in (surrounded by a mall and a bunch of other chain restaurants). 

My wife ordered the beet and goat cheese salad and it was big, and she said it tasted delicious. I had the ribs; which is what Baton Rouge is known for and what I highly recommend. They are the best ribs in town; I have tried the ribs in dozens of other places, but this is the place to go for ribs. 

We will return. 

Note: lots of individuals rooms that are great for groups and parties."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and ordered the Experience 10 oz. ribs for only 19$. I was expecting a tiny portion, but was surprised to receive a very good portion. It comes with mash potato, fries, or sweet potatoes fries! The ribs were tasty and not overly seasoned - definitely worth the money! 

I also had their crab cakes for entrée, apple crumble for dessert and their specialty bailey coffee. The hot apple crumble mixed with the ice cream was so comforting and gooood! On the other hand, the bailey coffee was quite bland."}
{"text":"This is a very nice place for dining. 
The service is excellent.

I usually have the Chicken Caesar - cant take a big set of ribs for lunch now, can i?  crazy place to go before any major event at the Bell Center, they usually line up from all the way out side."}
{"text":"I stopped in here with a coworker for lunch.  We both love Cajun food and we both had ravenous appetites, it looked good!

First off, the service was way too slow for as dead as it was in there.  The staff seemed to be more concerned with wandering around aimlessly and chatting than attending to any of the three tables where patrons were seated.

Secondly, the Cajun thing is more of a theme here than an attempt at actually preparing Cajun food, the spices were oversalted, the meat was mostly overcooked, except the baked beans, which were mostly undercooked.  There was also an embarrassing shortage of Cajun staples on the menu such as gumbo, jambalaya, red beans and rice, cornbread, anything containing gator etc.  I didn't see anything on the menu mentioning a roux base, nothing containing andouille or boudin.  I saw poutine, which every restaurant within a 250 km radius from there also served, and I saw Chinese food dishes as well (?).

Thirdly, we paid what I consider to be higher prices than were justified by the location, ambience, and overall food quality.

Ultimately we both had reasonable expectations, and not even those were met."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Maybe average to slightly above average depending on the item.  But the price seemed a little steep.  It could be that I'm still not totally used to the higher price of food in Montreal compared to the US, but still, it seemed a little too much for the quality.  I went there because someone else picked the restaurant, but I'd probably try to avoid this place in the future."}
{"text":"Way too much BBQ source and look like a soup for the pulled pork protein cheese is not not  melted for the price is not worth it at all"}
{"text":"Service is okay.

The food is great. Obviously it's more of a high end place so you can spend 20$+ easily.

I've never seen it packed so that is a bonus for when you are looking to relax and have a more intimate lunch or dinner.

There is always parking.

...they stop giving matches away...unfortunate"}
{"text":"I am always reminded by the similarities between Baton Rouge and J Alexander's. Gleaming hardwoods, massive tables and booths, low lighting, can cause a double-take. While there are also similarities with certain menu items, Baton Rouge offerings tend toward the steak and barbecue route which were popular with guests celebrating friendships and birthdays this holiday weekend.

Baton Rouge is always a go-to choice with my friends because of the varied menu. This evening, we started the meal with a crowd-pleaser, the Louisiana Spinach dip. It featured chunks of artichoke hearts, in a creamy cheese and spinach sauce. Sour cream (today's had an odd gummy texture) and salsa are also served with the ring of tortilla chips. Before our meals arrived, we had finished off every chip and polished off every last bit of the dip.

For the main course, I had the 10 oz portion of baby back ribs. A 16 oz portion is also available. While the ribs were fall-off-the-bone, fork-tender, they were good, not great; they did not taste as if they were smoked for several hours. Included with the meal is a choice of sides ranging from potatoes to coleslaw to cinnamon apples. I had the latter and they were below average. Instead of sweet, cinnamon apples that were chunky in texture, the apples today were over cooked and mushy. The baked potato, all dressed, looked better - I should have gone that route.

The chocolate cake for dessert was amazing - exactly what chocolate cake should be. Several decadent layers of cake covered in a rich layer of icing, the large portion of cake was delicious.

Service was good - the waiter was friendly and helpful and related well with all of us."}
{"text":"We booked into Baton Rouge as a large group for a conference. We do this often, and have had some pretty terrible experiences with different places. Not so at this Baton Rouge location. They were efficient, friendly, and the food was excellent. If you are coming to town with a large group, I can't recommend booking with them enough. They were so professional, and made separating bills for food and alcohol incredibly easy. 

Hats off to Baton Rouge for their expert handling of our large group (30-50 people!)"}
{"text":"We went there because one of my friends who is a foodie bragged and bragged about how good the food was. It's nothing spectacular. Over priced and service was slow and not very personable. I work in the restaurant industry and I guess my expectations are higher. If I was to pay the prices I paid, I'd rather go to milestones or even joeys... at least the service is always consistent. Will not go back"}
{"text":"This place is unimaginative and lame! That's what happens when a restaurant franchise is from Quebec instead of Louisiana.

The ribs are good; fall off the bone with great BBQ sauce but everything else not so good, and it is expensive.

The experience starts when you go in; I have been there 4 times now and every time the place is empty - I don't know that they will stay in business long. Not a great first impression, perhaps they will get busy one day....or just go under.

The service was the biggest thing I was frustrated by. I ordered the ribs special with fries (they had no salad option just fries, potato, or apples) and they were cold and extremely salty - I mean McDonald's suddenly became healthy salty. I complained to the waitress and asked for very little salt. She brought me fries that were just as salty. I by this time was annoyed, I told her \"these fries are just as salty as the first ones. I cant eat this; I have never had such salty fries in my life\" she replied laughing saying \"maybe that's a good thing\" for that reason I don't think I will ever go back, never in my dining experience has something like that ever happened. You don't treat customers that way and expect to keep them.

So check this place out but don't expect much; Tony Roma's is \"Famous for Ribs(tm)\" for a reason - they get how to provide good service!"}

{"text":"Came here for a spontaneous family dinner on Saturday night and had a lovely experience. I've been to several Baton Rouge locations but this was my first visit to the new location and the Old Scott House...had a great experience overall and can't wait to go back. 

I came with husband, my two kids, my dad and my MIL during their Mardi Gras event. The waitress was incredibly accommodating and took our kids' meal order earlier so the children could start eating. The $10 kids' chicken tender meal came 3 huge chicken tenders (not the usual breaded tenders but batter fried chicken breast strips) and vegetables on the side (I ordered extra soft). 

My husband and I ordered the Mardi Gras special ($25) which was the 10 oz rib dinner accompanied by a salad (crispy onions!) and dessert (key lime pie). For my sides I ordered the hot cinnamon apples and baked skillet beans. I also got a taste of the French fries and coleslaw from my husband. My ribs were fall-off-the-bone perfect like I expect from Baton Rouge. My MIL's fries were a bit salty and the coleslaw could have used more acid, but still loved the food overall.

The waitress was nice enough to give us two orders of ice cream for the kids even though we only ordered one kids' meal and wow, these cups of ice cream were huge! Delicious vanilla ice cream with visible vanilla bean seeds...I had to have some for myself :) We ate the key lime pie the next day and it was delicious as well... just the perfect amount of tartness and a very yummy crust. Already planning my next visit..."}

The restaurant is not busy AT ALL - I think we were one of 4 tables. The server was very friendly and attentive, she was knowledgeable about the menu and wine list, and our meals were served very quickly. The ribs are delicious - great sauce and tender. Other than this, there is not that much originality with the menu - even having family-style sides to share over ribs would be a welcome addition to the menu. I would come back for the ribs, but not for a special occasion - good food, but average overall."}

When we all ordered, the waiters seldomly came to checked up on us even with refilling with water. Although the servers were nice, the frequency of flagging someone down was harder as they were not around our area for the most part.

The steak was done well but I wouldn't say it was the best steak I've ever had, and I am no expert on steak. The veggies that came with the dishes were overcooked and really bland for taste.

Overall, the experience was pleasant and average, but not somewhere I would go out of my way to going again."}
{"text":"Came in around 4:30. Place was dead, that's fine. Had seafood linguini. At $25, a little overpriced, but acceptable. The problem when it's not busy is that the waitstaff koffeeklatches.

When it comes to the menu, this is not exactly the best place for me to be.  Simply because, I am on Weight Watchers right now.  And if you are watching calories, this is NOT where you want to go.

I went onto the website, and a side serving of cole slaw is a little more than 1/3 of my entire day's calorie requirements (I am allowed 1700 a day, and their side salad has 640 calories with 63 grams of fat).  As I combed through the nutritional information, it was evident to me that I was going to be having a house salad will some grilled chicken.  Even that, I had to \"piece meal\" together, as their chicken salad had deep fried chicken.  

Some examples right from their website:

Their grilled veggie sandwich had 39 grams of fat.  I thought this would be an option, but it came out to 19 pointsplus points, and I'm allowed 29 in a day.

This is not meant to be a jab at Baton Rouge, but it was a challenge to make a healthy choice.  From what I understand, this place is known for its ribs, but at this time, I cannot indulge.  The reality is, I am not this restaurant's target market.  

Before weight watchers, if I read this review about there being no healthy choices, my response would have been, \"so what?? Bring on the ribs! That's what people go there for!\".  

But today, I am saying don't assume if you are watching calories, that a side of cole slaw is a good choice.  Just sayin.....

I also want to point out that on the website, they are good enough to not only post the nutritional info, they ALSO post the Allergens, so that people with allergies can see exactly what is in food.  I don't have allergies, but I do dine wtih people who do, so kudos to Baton Rouge for providing that information.

As far as my meal, my salad was made with iceberg lettuce, and a few strands of other veggies (seemed to be similar to the pre-made salads, which is common in chain restaurants), and the grilled chicken was fine.   It was juicy, so they do know how to cook meat there.

Even though I was hard on them regarding the menu, I will come back and try the ribs at a future date.  The staff were nice, and the ambiance is great.  However, I just really didn't have a lot of options in Baton Rouge.  Gave them a star for ambiance, a star for service (nice weight staff, and having the calorie and allergen information is a fantastic service), and a star for a very juicy, tender grilled chicken breast.  They lost a few stars for not having more healthy options, and for what I assume to be a pre-packaged salad."}
{"text":"Nice cocktails! Bartender working at this place is really nice. Love that guy. Cocktails at this place aren't expensive."}
{"text":"Ribs were good. Service was good. Overall the experience was pleasant."}
{"text":"This should be a 3.5 review, not just three. This is a basic Baton Rouge place.

The good: Customer service seems to be important here. We got good service from the entrance to the table, and by the waitress. Waitress was always smiling.

The bad: Waitress also has a drenched sweat shirt. Food was ordinary. Not exceptional. Waitress had to come back to verify our order.

Th reason this place gets a 3.5, it is because their service is really good. They got that part right."}
{"text":"Baton Rouge is one of my favourite restaurants where you can go for a juicy burger and good meat plates.

The good: Food is great! Baton Rouge burger is tasty and juicy. Tons of fries. Not that busy, so you can get a great table.

The bad: Waiters and waitresses are bad. They do not smile, or barely looks at you. You can wait for a while before receiving your dish. Bathroom is badly located as you have to almost go into the bar and kitchen area to get to them.

Even though we love the restaurant, we also know that the service is awful. So if you come with your mind set on bad service, you will enjoy the meal.

** UPDATE ** After the owner saw this review on another application, he invited us over for a dinner to give us a better experience. Food was just as great, but service was way better. Next time, we will go when we are not expected and see how it goes."}
{"text":"Very satisfied with our Mother's Day lunch. :)

NY striploin medium rare with baked potatoes and their ribs are highly recommended."}
{"text":"I like this place! Traveling here on business and cane here and set at the bar area. Service is fast and friendly. The ribs were good. They had a special on the ribs so not too expensive. Sweet potato fries were definitely frozen but fine. My wine was good and the service was perfect. Atmosphere is casual, clean and easy going. Menus are well written and they have a lot of options if you don't want ribs."}
{"text":"It was a good place to have dinner on the patio before some Just for Laughs shows.  They were very busy so we had no water refills and our orders came out wrong and over cooked.  Server was nice enough but was not able to help us get what we ordered."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! We were disgusted in this place. The plates smelled horrendous, the food was so awful we didn't even finish it and asked for the check immediately. We simply tried this place out of convenience and basically were robbed of our time and money. I'm quite sure one of my family members is sick as a result. 

The ribs are all bone, the marination is not tasty and carries a terrible after taste. The salad was wilted and dry, how awful. We immediately felt bad as we attempted to try the French fries. How is this restaurant even in business ? So disappointing. Wash your dishes ! And learn to cook..."}
{"text":"Time & Date of visit: 5:45pm on Saturday, July 25, 2015
Atmosphere: dressy casual, business attire 
Cleanliness: restaurant appeared clean. Tables, chairs & cutlery were clean.
Constructive criticism: a wedge of lemon and some bacon bits would be nice on the Cesar salad item.
Cuisine: steakhouse!
Facilities: clean!
Food: To start, we both had a Cesar salad which was good. The croutons were crunchy and the romain was crisp. The dressing was creamy but a bit strong on the garlic side. My boyfriend ordered the 16oz BBQ pork back ribs. The ribs fell of the bone, and were so tasty. His dish was coupled with a side of coleslaw which was nice and creamy and a mountain of their skinny fries. So delicious! 
I ordered the 10oz BBQ pork back ribs with a loaded baked potato. My ribs were also fall off the bone and basted with their tasty sauce. My baked potato was soft, fluffy and the melted cheddar on top with sour cream hit the spot. To drink, he has a Rickards White on tap, I had a water lol. For desert, we tried the Baton Rouge cookie. Wow! The cookie was deep, and it was warm. A scoop of vanilla ice cream added to cookie made it more sinful. So tasty. Not bad for a cookie, it hit the spot. 
Likeliness of returning or recommending to others: this was our second time visiting. We'll come with a group for our next visit. Great for families with children as the restaurant was busy with younger families.
Parking: private
Portion Sizes: large! We left stuffed!
Price: $73.45
Service: our waiter was kind and took our orders quickly within the first couple of minutes.
Selection: wide variety of foods. Check out their specials. The items are fairly priced! 
What makes this restaurant stand out from the others: they specialize in ribs. Guaranteed fresh. They also have a lobster menu with all sorts of lobster inspired items. 
Hours of Operation: Monday to Thursday 11am to 11pm. Friday to Saturday 11am to 12am. Sunday 11am to 10pm.

{"text":"I didn't read the restaurant's online menu so I went, mistakenly, thinking that I'd be ordering Cajun food for dinner. Yelp does say \"Cajun/Creole\" but in truth, there is none. No jambalaya, no gumbo, no catfish, not even a side order of rice let alone dirty rice. The food is ordinary everyday food that can be found anywhere; burgers, pasta, salmon, baked chicken and ribs. If there was any hint of a food theme I guess it should be called \"Normal Everyday Restaurant\".

I ordered the Applewood Salmon which was nicely prepared. An appetizer of bruschetta seemed to be untoasted garlic bread topped with tomatoes and lettuce - would not recommend."}
{"text":"Ribs ribs ribs ribs ribs....the reason I first went to Baton Rouge about 18 years ago was to try baby back ribs for the first time, here we are 18 years later and Baton Rouge still reproduces that taste experience. Fall off the bone baby back ribs, never used my knife, smothered in smoky bbq sauce served with a beautiful baked potato. Staff was very attentive and in a great mood which makes the restaurant experience nicer."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of places for Nachos and this is the best place to have yummy Nachos! I know steakhouse nice place not really the place to have them but its worth trying. Bartender cocky and  service a bit slow. Not very welcoming. I'll still go back just for the nachos :)."}
{"text":"Got served in second once seated.. Waiter wasnt friendly. Nachos we couldnt have on the terrace which was disappointing.Option of having grilled calamari was nice however. Sangria was expensive but good.my chicken fingers were so so wouldnt order them again."}
{"text":"Great place and great food. Went on Valentine's Day and passed on the Valentine's Day menu, but had a 12oz sirloin and was cooked to perfection. Service was expeditious and not delayed too much due to the busy night. I heard the ribs are supposedly the best....maybe next time."}
{"text":"The old red stick...can't really go wrong!

I know the executive chef at one of the other locations so it gives me a bit more insight to the chain and I am definitely a fan.

I usually like restaurants a little more unique, as this one is your typical Keg style place, but I do have to say it is good food and service.  And on the South Shore, you're at times limited to what kinds of restaurants are available...I would say this is right up there in Boucherville.

{"text":"Baton Rouge has exquisite and succulent ribs, fall off the bone tender. The side dishes are amusing but delicious. Their service is excellent, compares to no other restaurant. The ambiance gives you the feeling that you're in a classy restaurant yet so comfortable.  The wait for a table is sometimes long but we often sit at the bar. The bar is also sometimes crowded, but I will not take off points for that, it just tells me that it's a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Seen one seen them all. Big chain food, all frozen and defrosted on site. Bad service. And an owner who walks around like he's king tut, waiting for his shift to be done so he can go back to Chomedey."}
{"text":"The ribs are out of this world good! The meat falls right off of the bone. I had the 16 oz ribs and a fully dressed baked potato and both were dynamite. 

We had a party of 10 and they were able to accommodate us without reservations. They have a kids menu and plenty of Gluten Free options. 

I would highly recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Fabulous night out! Danie was a wonderful server. We enjoyed the cocktails, the calamari appetizer, the salad entrees - everything was hot, tasty and fresh. Our only complaint is that the apple cobbler tasted stale and the creme brûlée was cold on the bottom. The cookie, however, was unreal!!! Thanks for a wonderful evening. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Service was great BUT....the food was terrible. I ordered the lobster poutine which was microwaved french fries smothered in canned watery beef gravy with frozen lobster bits. My friend ordered fish tacos which was two small flour torillas  filled with iceberg lettuce and three small pieces of fish. Terrible."}
{"text":"Baton Rouge puts The Keg to shame! The prime rib is amazing. Fresh, juicy, and so tasty. The steak is also very, very good. The ribs, however, are an absolute stand out."}
{"text":"The food wasn't really good  to write about it. Very expensive with no talent for service.
My food was late because they have a party for lunch. Unbelievable that a waitress need to tel me that. 
I'm not recomen this place.

Again too expensive for the food they serve."}
{"text":"It was good. I had the ribs and shrimp. It was not expensive. It was my first time. I would recommended to others who is the area. The staff was nice and funny."}
{"text":"First time in Montreal, unfortunately without my lovely wife, so I set off on my own to find a glass of wine and a meal since the hotel restaurant is closed for dinner on Sundays. 

After a walk through Chinatown, which had a restaurant every few feet but none that appealed, I headed to the Quartier des Spectacles, a little more upscale and artsy area, and came upon Baton Rouge. 

Nice quiet place with 80's music and some French songs playing as well, and Stephane my waiter greeted me promptly in French and in English. I mangled my attempt at French (use it or lose it), so English it was. 

Special of the day was grilled grouper with fresh salsa, steamed veggies and my choice of side was rice pilaf.   Lots of other steakhouse type offerings on the menu, but the fish got my vote. 

While the food did not knock my socks off, it was good for the price point and the Italian Pinot Grigio that I had with my meal was really tasty. 

Solid three stars for the food and I'd give my server Stephane four."}

Touristes, régalez-vous !!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with 3 friends for dinner, friday night one of the busiest nights therefore everything should be on the best game..but it wasn't. We had the spinach dip to start which was a little empty, not a good portion size. As a main meal I had the steak which was pretty much rare and not what i asked , my friend had the ribs and chicken tenders combo which came with 2 tiny chicken tenders. The other 2 people from my group had the tenders platter.. half of the tenders had no chicken on them and only the crust. I usually like it here but tonight it was another level of bad. The service was also very slow..sloppy and not professional. My company on the other hand was flawless which is probably why i have shades enough to give this a 2 star."}
{"text":"My favorite Baton Rouge of all the other franchises! 

Doesn't give you that franchise-y feeling but more like you're at home?! 

Staff is great and friendly! 
Menu is superb and food is awesome try the chicken! Delicious baked potato. Drinks aren't diluted just great! 

Worth the drive to Maple!"}
{"text":"This chain has certainly changed over the 15+ years I've been going to it... the prices have gone steadily up, the portions gotten steadily gotten smaller (particularly if you go downtown). On a personal level, the ribs and fries remain favorite meals and every few months I find myself going back for one of my favorite meals. The chicken tenders are great as well.

The service is polite, almost robotic as waiters rarely have a moment to talk with their guests yet are always more than available for refills, asking you how you like your meal exactly 5 minutes after the food is served (yes we timed this once). They are competent and work towards serving you efficiently and quickly so that the next client can get to their seats.

The line-ups during peak hours can get pretty ridiculous. Expect to wait an hour if you visit between 6 to 9.

I like the ambiance of the place, decorations are warm, colors are suitable and seating comfortable.

As mentioned before, the baby back ribs are excellent and the fries usually well done. The chicken tenders are usually good but sometimes are hit and miss as they put too much batter.

I've also had several different meals in the past, such as their burgers and salads which were very good.

Sodas are now fountain based down in quality of the bottles of old and can be watered down at times. Refills are free however."}
{"text":"We are visiting from Washington, DC and just happened to stumble across this gem. From the moment the 7 of us walked in to the moment we left we we were treated great and the food was awesome too. We started with calamari, lobster stuffed mushrooms (those were our favorite) and lobster chowder. We had many meals, prime rib, filet mignon, ribs and 2 kids meals. For dessert we had the brownie and raspberry cheesecake, both were yummy to finish off the meal. All were absolute delicious. The reason I'm giving 5 stars though is because of our server Ashley and the manager. Ashley was very knowledgeable about the restaurant and the food, was super sweet to us and the timing of everything was perfect. Customer service is huge to me and she exceeded my expectations! The manager checked on us several times to see how we were doing, when we come back to the area we will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"They were able to accommodate a group of 10 adults and 5 kids with just a 2 day notice! On the day of, the place was packed with people waiting at the door but we didn't have to wait to be seated and were promptly attended to. The service was seamless and they had no problem remembering who ordered what when it came time for being served or even for the separate bills.

The food was perfect! I had the seared tuna and fries with coleslaw and requested precaution as I have a gluten allergy. I had no issues afterwards as the food served was 100% gluten free.

Their wines were good too! The servings here are huge! 

The kiddos loved their meal (battered chicken, fries, juice with ice cream for dessert) what is there not to like?"}
{"text":"They have a simple menu. The restaurant decoration is nice, and cozy with warm colors.
I consider their BBQ Pork Back ribs as the best in town, with their sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"I dont know what happened to this place Ive been before and had no problem. The worst though is when me and my friend went to Baton Rouge for a party where there was over 15 guest. My order was forgotten as well as my friends we were waiting even for a drink they kept forgetting us. we just felt that probably there was too many people to serve. Don't get me wrong I still love the food especially those chicken tenders but I don't think forgetting we were there by the waiter was necessary. I will still visit again. I hope the service improves next time"}
{"text":"RIBS RIBS RIBS!!! Apparently this is the place to go for ribs. I'll have to give it to them, it was juicy and falling off the bone. But it wasn't flavorful or saucy enough. We had to ask the waiter to bring more sauce, but by the time he got it for us we were almost half way done.

I got the porterhouse Pittsburgh style, which was quite delicious. The sides are huge. I opted out of the butter and garlic, so got the bowl of sauteed mushrooms on the side to top my steak. I had enough to share with my table of 11. Very reasonably priced and it was super crowded on a Sunday night. Our waiter was pretty good, he was pretty busy himself attending to all of us.

I would come back for a nice, meaty meal with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Horrible. Will never go again. Their prices are similar to the keg and the quality of food PALES in comparison!!!! Mediocre at best. So disappointed! Will never return!"}
{"text":"Good steak house very close to Laval Sheraton hotel and shopping mall 
All staff accommodated our poor French and we received English menus 
Soup was great : shrimp and spinach and curry broth type , strange combo but very nice 

Chicken dishes were good with lots of Frits 

Nice selection of draft beer and wine too 
I did not try deserts 

Generally s very warm friendly dining and bar space"}
{"text":"This is a steak house that does not know how to cook a steak. I ordered a rare prime rib, and it came out pink. When I complained they told me it was a \"roast beef\" and that this was as good as it gets. Not a good sign for the chef if he cant even cook a prime rib."}
{"text":"Blindsided. Place is expensive. I live in Bklyn and my drink here at Bâton Rouge was $15 and my forgettable burger was $15. Never again. At Coppelia's in NYC I can get a juicy, seasoned burger WITH pork for $8.59 and a strong drink for $11.00 and that's on West 14th Street! SMH. Tourist trap.

After 7 hours of driving my stomach canceled out my brain."}
{"text":"Seems like an overpriced, tourist type of place to me. It was fine, but not where you want to eat if you're only briefly visiting Montreal. It was late, and we were in need of some near the hotel grub so it sufficed.

Pros:
- Seated immediately on a Friday night.
- Good and attentive waiter. 
- Fries were delicious.
- Meat was good...not great.
- Servings were huge. 

Cons:
- Pretty ordinary food...
- ...at fancy food prices. 

Most of the dishes were about $25 which is okay considering the large portions, but I can think of tons of other $25 plates that completely outshine my regular pork chop and fries. Use your money to go somewhere that is more exciting and tastes better. TVs are around and cheering for hockey game mid dinner is definitely allowed."}
{"text":"Très déçue de ma supposée salade de bavette de Boeuf. Très très peu de salade, épinard au lieu de la roquette, prix élevé... La viande était correct mais sans wow. Je sors jamais vraiment satisfaite de ce resto... Je pense que j'ai donné assez de chance ;)"}
{"text":"Took a while to get served here. Ordered a burger, it was to come with beMs and coleslaw. I wanted steamed veg , so they charged me $2.50, and I got a couple of little sprigs of broccoli. Kind of small and dry. Also had the calamari, which was better . But overall I found this over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"Great food, great service doesn't necessarily result to a great overall rating. Not when so many restrictions are spelled out during reservations such as \" if your group is not all here during seating, you will lose reservations\" or \"if you're a few minutes late, you will lose reservations \". With so many other food options in town, why would any business stick sticks in its wheels by feeling that they are doing their customers favours by serving them? Seating 6 on a tiny table pushed against a wall where waiters continously bang on your back. Potatoe soup recipe needs attention. Not sure if mashed potatoe served in a soup bowl qualifies as soup. Ribs were spot on as usual. Prices are creeping up."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend came here for our anniversary dinner. He had the ribs and I had the cowboy steak. Both dishes were absolutely phnomenal. Our server Stefani was very gracious and knowledgeable and made our stay all that much better. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"En ce lundi soir le restaurant etait réserve pour une soirée de levée de fond.
Le cocktail de crevettes est d'une simplicité mais les crevettes étaient de grosseur moyenne et très bonnes. La salade César etait vraiment goûteuse avec beaucoup de parmesan comme je l'aime. Ensuite arrive le rib steak cuit comme demandé. Délicieux steak sur le charbon de bois. Le service fut parfait. Grand stationnement"}
{"text":"We have been to Baton Rouge twice, once shortly after we moved to Ontario, and once this week. It is a chain, and most of the restaurants we tend to eat at here are not, so perhaps that should have been enough to keep us away. However, I recall that it was pretty good the first time we went there. Unfortunately, our recent experience will likely keep us from returning. 

We ordered the cheddar cheese dip for a appetizer. It is not at all spicy, but for some reason, it is served with tortilla chips. I would have enjoyed this part of the meal much more if it had come with some type of bread. 

Overall, the pace of service was quite slow. Our server was perhaps the most apathetic individual we've had the pleasure of being waited on by, and he disappeared for long periods of time. When our entrees finally arrived, my husband's ribs and crab cakes looked over done. Im not sure if they'd been sitting around waiting to be delivered or what. Our server acknowledged that the ribs were overdone, but said the crab cakes \"might just be like that,\" though he was good about getting the entree remade. This took quite a while, but the new ribs and crab cakes were both better.

I had the veggie sandwich-- it was just okay. It was odd that the goat cheese was tiny crumbles, rather than a spread or something, so this flavour was missing. 

Our server disappeared again at the end of the meal. It took forever for us to get out of there-- we were there about 2 hours, and we didn't even order dessert. Even though we basically ate our meals separately, the restaurant did not discount our meal at all. Since it is an upscale chain, the total price was well into the $$$ range, and this was not a good value for the food we received."}
{"text":"it was too dark for me.  the booth seats were horrible, very very uncomfortable.  i could not sit still, i had to get up every so often.  there were not enough waiting staff imo.  our waiter seemed not that knowledgeable about the menu.  he forgot to mention a few things that were free for my daughter.  i had to ask him!

i will never come back here again.  sorry!"}
{"text":"Yes, it is a chain restaurant. Nice selection of entrees, some good craft beers.  Friendly and efficient service, even if you do not speak French. Our entrees were delicious, portions were plentiful."}
{"text":"Love this place! 

Great ribs, really nice wait staff, and the place itself is super swanky. Great place for a dinner with the parentals or a nice date or a business meeting... Pretty much any special occasion! 

While a bit on the pricier side, I do think the ribs are worth it--although I can't really comment on the other dishes. I found the chicken and mushroom risotto to be quite delicious as well, and I'm definitely looking forward to trying other things on the menu. 

I found the 10oz ribs to be the perfect portion for one, especially if you get the fries and the slaw, so don't let your hunger talk you into getting the the 16oz!! 

Anyways, hope you pay this place a visit--it's a good one."}
{"text":"I live in the central SW so I'd never even heard of this restaurant before a friend suggested we try it. The menu looked good so I was game to give it a try.

We had a great visit - the server was very attentive, constantly replacing my diet coke as I was finishing the one previous. Granted, it was pretty early on a weekend evening so the restaurant was VERY quiet.

As it was such an early dinner, I only had a soup and salad. The soup (creamy potato) was awesome - very thick and yummy. 

The mixed salad was missing something - I would have liked the addition of some fruit or nuts to go along with the egg (I don't eat bacon so I had that removed) but I had the asian dressing and it was delicious.

All in all, I had a pretty good visit. I don't know when I'll be back since it's so out of my way, but I wouldn't mind trying some of the mains.

{"text":"Très bons burgers et bonne localisation avec une belle terrasse, surtout en ce moment avec le festival de Jazz !"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! We went 3 times during our week stay in Oakville. All of the different servers that took care of us were very professional and accommodating- not one ever said NO to a request without checking with a manager and most often simply said YES, we can do that.
Manager Kurt Johnson is especially focused on his guests having a great dining experience and not only took time to check back to make sure we were happy with our meals, but clearly showed his investment in his position and co-workers with his actions: always helping servers by doing any task that needed to be done whether clearing a table or bringing out food as well as engaging his customers to ensure they had a wonderful time at his establishment.

OK- the food: we had various dishes as the Wife and I have different tastes. Me: the pork ribs were great! Fall off the bone, tasty delights! I got the full order thinking I would take some for a snack later- NO! stuffed myself eating the whole thing. Too good.
Also had the beef rib special which was almost as good- good size serving with a nice size chunk of steak barely hanging onto the rib and very delicious, but just a touch dry. No problem as when Kurt noticed the texture of the beef, he brought a bowl of \"au jus\" to try which effectively gave me two mains: ribs and prime rib! 
The different sides I tried were excellent as well- BBQ beans, sweet potato fries and mixed veggies.

The Wife had the lobster poutine thingy and really enjoyed the chunks of lobster and also the blackened bassa, which had a really nice fruity chutney.

We aren't big on eating desserts but shared the brownie with ice cream and it was so delicious and rich that we could only eat a few bites and then took it back to our room and enjoyed it a couple of bites at a time over the next 2 days.

Also tried the spinach dip ap and it is also very good, but very rich so beware, as you may be taking a large doggy bag home if you finish that before dinner arrives.

Definitely returning the next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"I used to work in the area and would come here at least once a month. I found their ribs to be great.

During a return visit here, I still enjoyed my ribs (with a baked potato) but they weren't as good as I remembered it (but still very good in my opinion). Depending on the time that you go, parking generally isn't an issue unless you want to park very close to the restaurant.

I went with a friend and we decided to eat at the bar at my friend's suggestion. He decided to order the steak and I had my usual which was ribs with an all dressed baked potato. His steak came with fries which he was unable to finish so he gave me some of his fries.

The ribs are still \"fall off the bone\" ribs so the meat is not stuck on the bone and using a fork, the meat easily falls off. The all dressed baked potato was also very good. It comprised of cheese, sour cream, bacon bits, and shallots."}
{"text":"This was the first Baton Rouge that I've ever been to and I sometimes return to it.

During a recent visit, I ordered my usual which was ribs with an all dressed baked potato. Service was relatively quick for a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant wasn't too crowded.

This Baton Rouge is located inside Complexe Desjardins but the entrance to get inside from within the mall is a bit hard to find due to some construction inside the mall so I entered from the outside on Ste-Caterine Street.

Don't really have any complaints about my experience at this Baton Rouge."}
{"text":"every time I come to Montreal, my family and i eat here. I love this city and my family loves this restaurant. However,  the meals have decreased its quality and the service is okay. (Not extremely friendly) this time our family order ribs and chicken. It was okay. But our fries were served without any condiments and when we asked the waiter, we still did not receive it. After calling the hostess, we explained to her that we did not have any condiments and asked her to provide us condiments. She did. This was awkward.  Overall, restaurant is okay. But its too expensive for an okay experience. Hopefully the next time we come back it will be better."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a bite on a Thursday during Happy Hour to wait out traffic. We sat at the bar in hopes of finding a deal. They had $10 burgers, $16 ribs and a $20 steak. We decided to split a rib (with fries) and steak (with baked potato $2).

Service was slow to start as there was a shift change, however our bartender Sara was great. She knew her menu, was personable, and although she might have thought it went unnoticed, I appreciated her asking her colleague how long the tonic can had been opened then tossed it when her coworker implied it \"should\" be ok with some hesitation. Taking pride in providing me a good drink is how you win over my heart.

The ribs were good but nothing special. Fries we were spiced. The steak was small, but the cut was great and it was cooked exactly as ordered. The peppercorn sauce was good, but again nothing special. They really hit the nail on the head with that baked potato however. It was salted and brushed on the outside, with butter under the sour cream. There wasn't much in the bacon department but there was green onion so I was happy. 

Overall, good service, good food and happy hour specials. The bar menu (written on a chalkboard above the bar) was a much better price than we would have gotten in the dinning room. Not sure if the $5 bar rail carries over either."}
{"text":"Friendly service and food is always good and generous. Can't go wrong with the baby back ribs with the side of their delicious fries and slaw! YUM!"}
{"text":"Food is usually good at any Baton Rouge. Service is OK also. Probably why it is one of my restaurants of choice when surrounded by chain restaurants. However this location is a must avoid. I assume it must be closing down soon based on the condition of the restaurant. The seats are ripped and worn. The menus are all tattered and grimy. Graffiti is carved into the bathroom walls. I'm not sure why the hostess would choose to seat us in the grimy back corner next to a pile of high chairs and table parts when the restaurant was 95% empty at 6:30. We couldn't get out of there fast enough. I felt sorry for my kid who suggested it for his birthday - he had to listen to the rest of us make jokes about the filthy, dumpy state of this hole. At least the food and server was good. Note to chef: you may cook your burgers slightly pink intentionally I'm ok with that I often order them that way but a Kids menu burger pink. LOL. Waitress was excellent However very low points for service when you consider the host seated us in the worst seat in the house (and despite having a reservation) when the restaurant was empty. That table next to the pile of furniture and high chairs with ripped seats should be the LAST table filled. The final laugh was seeing the best location award proudly displayed at the entrance. Close this dump it's an embarrassment to the brand."}
{"text":"Busy place that does not honour reservations . The parking lot was a mess and had problems finding parking -15 mins .The  service started out great but sure died. The selection of food is good . We had everything from the salads, fish , steak and burgers
They have no bread as a starter.   they  expect you to order appetizer . Especially when ordering a steak that comes with salad. The main meal was great but the service was terrible . The Dollard and the Decarie both have the same bad service .. to bad because the food is good"}
{"text":"Baton Rouge has the best ribs ever! These mouth watering ribs fall off the bone. They are cooked over night, and basted with the sauce. You will never forget ribs like this. The Louisiana BBQ Chicken is another favourite if you are not in the mood for ribs.

Has an appetizer the homemade spinach dip is amazing and can be a meal, so try not to overdose on it no matter how addicting it is!"}
{"text":"Lovely place, the food is awesome.
The only thing that could be better if they had drinks menus. You can't see what the choice is."}
{"text":"Pub fare food at fine dining prices. Food was not bad just not what you expect for $25"}
{"text":"I had the ribs and as advertised...they fell out the bone! Great stuff! The fries were alright. The apples and cinnamon were so so. The service was good and a good variety of drinks."}
{"text":"They have a decent selection of food items to choose. Service is pretty good too. The wine list looks extensive however my first two options were not available. I had the potato soup and I was impressed. I also got the sirloin and mashed potatoes and they were pretty good as well. I do think the items are overpriced."}
{"text":"I know this place is usually known for its ribs, steaks, and meat in general... but seriously...

THEY SERVE THE BIGGEST SALADS EVER! 

OMG.

I thought I was being health conscious by ordering a salad. It was like a whole bag of it was put on my plate/platter. Couldn't believe my eyes. I felt like I had made a big mistake. The salad also looked wilty as I got deeper into it & the stocks were browning. 

Luckily, it was still a tasty salad. The grilled sirloin was perfectly cooked. The lime & ginger dressing was also very good.

Other recommendations:
- Grilled calamari
- Seared tuna salad (BIG, too)
- BBQ pork back ribs"}
{"text":"Allez-y pour les côtes levées, ce sont les meilleurs. Les salades sont bonnes également. J'ai un petit faible pour les fêves cuites au four."}
{"text":"You can't beat this, prices are reasonable , service is 5 start I've been here 5 times, the food is great everything is perfect and I'm here on a Saturday night on a long weekend."}
{"text":"Excellent service and very good food.  The best food we've had in Montreal.  We ate dinner on 12/23/10 and lunch on 12/24/10.  I had BBQ pork ribs for dinner and Chicken Tenders for lunch."}
{"text":"Pour les vrais amateur de ribs! Un vrai régale. Seul défault de la plupares des batons rouge,est la rapidité du service. Beaucoup trop vite! Il faut le mentionner dès le début que vous êtes pas pressés!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and have never been impressed and this time was no exception. I decided to give another opportunity and after being brushed off by the hostess I knew nothing had changed. Service remains to be minimal. I ordered a lobster poutine and an order of chicken tenders. The lobster tastes like it comes from a can, the chicken tenders do not come with fries or any sides anymore as they used to, instead they offer the option to buy fries on the side for an extra 4$. I would rather go to moxies or Reuben's.  Same price, much better service and atmosphere, better and healthier selection of food. Needless to say I will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We had a dinner reservation. It took in total 3 hours to get from ordering  to cashing out. Steak was overcooked and dry, fries were stringy small things. Waited one hour for an expensive bad meal. Music was too loud and 70% if the place was empty so I don't know why they cant cook for one table. Never ever coming back. ! Don't go unless u want to overpay for bad food and service."}
{"text":"THE place for a pre or post game meal when you see the Habs.  The ribs used to be better and I do not like the switch to the express game day menu.  On a recent visit the ribs were dry.  That being said the next time I am in Montreal for a hockey game I'll still go back because its just what you do before a Habs game."}
{"text":"Had a rib-tacular dinner here with 6 work colleagues tonight!  Man oh Man was it a good meal!  Caesar salad tasted less garlicky than previously (which was nice!).  We had 2 bottles of Menage a trois which was a perfect accompaignment!"}
{"text":"Frankly I was just disappointed with Baton Rouge. 

In sequence:
- the Manhattan I ordered was watery and weak
- the spinach dip was not cooked thoroughly and when it was taken back, they returned it after only reheating it in the microwave
- the staff was cool but not overwhelming, especially with several occasions to provide good customer service
- the filet was good, but not prime quality

For those south of the border, think Hillstone's/Houston's but with lower quality results."}
{"text":"This is the third time we've come here. The service is actually really good despite the terrible food. I don't recall ever having a terrible food experience but this last one was horrendous!!! The appetizer we ordered for our toddler wasn't bad. It was chicken strips and fries. Can't go wrong with that. The grilled calamari was way too salty and so not good. Eww. The soup wasn't terrible but wasn't good enough to finish. My husbands prime rib was over done and to be honest didn't even look like prime rib at all. I got the who tuna. It was OK. Not great but was edible enough. But the worst dish of all was the chocolate mousse. How the heck do you make chocolate mousse taste like crap?????? I don't get it. It was not whipped, it was warm and extremely sweet. Too sweet. It wasn't even ready and the server said it was fresh and a new batch. Big mistake because it hadn't chilled for long enough so it was served prematurely. I really wished she hasn't told us it was ready because I really would have preferred to order the brownie. Anyway, totally not coming back again. We lucked out and didn't have to wait long for a table on a Friday night. Yay. But nasty food. Nay."}
{"text":"Steaks are ok but French fries could be improved prices are a little steep since it's an upscale steakhouse but for birthday parties it's great lots of fun and gatherings"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times had terrible experiences. I went last week with my boyfriend and wasn't impressed. The food was either bland, chewy to the point where I couldn't eat it, soggy, or just plain gross. He got the Baton Rouge burger that came with one lone, sad looking piece of bacon. They brought him the burger before we had even gotten our appetizer, and then picked it up again and delivered it to a different table. We weren't super impressed by that. We agreed that if someone else wanted to go we would go again, but never on our own. A couple days later I was meant to go with three friends. Two of the friends happen to use wheelchairs. I had called days in advance to make reservations, asking them to note that we needed a table that could accommodate two people who use wheelchairs. All this means is we can't use a booth, and they need to take away two chairs. Should be easy. We showed up for our six o'clock reservation and were told the only table available could only accommodate one person in a wheelchair, and they wanted the other to leave their wheelchair. We refused and pointed out that they should have reserved a table that could accommodate our party like we requested, or told me on the phone that they are unable to accommodate. We agreed to wait for an available table. At 6:20 they said another table was available, but there were reservations at seven so we had to be done by then. We left and will never be going back. We went next door to St. Hubert, where they had zero problems seating us."}
{"text":"On parle d'une chaine de restaurant, donc il n'y a pas vraiment de surprise à avoir. Mais, je peux dire que le service était très bien, l'endroit propre. Nous avions une grande table ronde pour notre groupe, ce qui était parfait pour échanger pendant le souper. C'est très bien localisé pour ceux qui vont voir des spectacles dans le cartier, et le service qui est rapide ne vous fait pas arriver en retard.

Un restaurant pour ne pas se casser la tête quand on doit réserver."}
{"text":"Prime Steak here is my favorite. It's unique. It's fantastic. It's gonna be Huuuuuge."}
{"text":"Horrible in every possible way. I'll be brief but we went to dinner before the symphony and ordered 2 salads. Mine came 15 min before my wife's. We asked our server what was going on and got the standard \"it will be out soon\" response. We went to dinner together and planned to eat together! 

Never got a refill on our drinks. Never got asked if we wanted dessert. Never saw our server again basically! It was like eating in a hectic zoo.

I worked in service for 10 years and I know what a rush looks like. It was busy but that is no excuse for what happened. Avoid at all costs unless I guess they are dead and it's 4pm on a Tuesday. Maybe then it will be a good experience."}
{"text":"This was a corporate event, with 35 friends and colleagues. The restaurant wasn't busy and we made a reservation on top of it. The had plenty of notice to expect the large party. 

Well, the steak was cold. The Pasta also was cold. I don't mean Luke-warm, it was actually cold..cold. The Long Island drink was mostly coke and not really with alcohol.

What a disaster! Don't bother coming here."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on Saturday night with a party of 6.  I was excited to finally see this place as I remember it as the Old Scott house.  The restaurant is nice, but it was almost empty...I thought this was weird on a Saturday night.

The waitress/hostess seated us quickly at a back table and took our drink order promptly.  She was nice enough but I thought it was weird that she basically told us that the previous management and staff sucked and they had done a total overhaul since then.

I ordered the Ahi tuna, others at the table ordered the ribs and steak.  Although everything looked good, I though it just tasted OK  ( we all sampled each others food!)

On another \"wierd\" note, the server refused to split one of the salads that we had ordered in half as she quote \"didnt want to ruin the intergrity of the dish\"  give me a break...it was a salad!!!

We paid over 100$ for the two of us for our mains, two beers and two gin and tonics.....I didnt think it was worth it at all.  The ribs we make at home are much tastier and the salad was something that we could also make at home....nothing special here.

Although I didnt hate it, I expected more for the prices they charge.  I am in no hurry to go back."}
{"text":"I cant believe that is what they served me when i ordered a premium aged-beef steak. Tasteless and over-cooked, and bad presentation. 
And their chocolate brownies .. both texture and taste are absolutely the same as a chocolate cupcake.."}
{"text":"This was very good. I loved the house made salad dressing. I only had a salad with chicken breast so little to say bad about. The service was good & fast the the food was good quality. It's a do-over but I'd order something else....great menu selection as well."}
{"text":"Had the chicken dish (don't remember the name but the only one). It was excellent, chose the garlic mashed and they to were great. For dessert had the apple strudel... Again excellent. Service was great and the team work is off the charts...a minimum of 5 people assisted at the table."}
{"text":"Should've reconsidered when I saw it was 2 doors down from McDonald's. It is basically a very expensive TGI Friday without the service. 
Steak was ok. Vegetables were nondescript. Large pieces of broccoli with woody stems. My sons broccoli was all brown around the edges. They maybe didn't look at it before serving. 
Wife ordered $37 jewels of the sea supposedly with bisque sauce. It came out dry grilled. When we asked about the sauce waiter said he never heard of it with bisque sauce. (See online menu). No offer or inkling to make it right. Not even a consideration. 
So basically, they seem to count on tourist location. Don't need repeat business.
Service - 1 star 
food- 2 stars. 
There are better options for the money in this great city."}
{"text":"Warning: Do not order appetizers if you don't plan on bringing home a doggie bag.  The portions (ridiculously huge) are true-to-form for a restaurant from the deep south, where if you are not obese or overweight, you are the minority.

I'm actually glad the food was only decent - this allowed me to control the urge to finish everything on my plate.  I ordered the portobello mushroom sandwich - it took me a while to find it under the mountain of fries, but it was enjoyable."}
{"text":"I've been to Bâton Rouge several times and I've never been disappointed. I love the layout of the restaurant, the service is great, the prices are fair and the food is pretty awesome. 

The steak is always cooked to perfection and the sweet potato fries are to die for. I've also had the steak salad which is huge and very flavorful. The only thing I've had at Bâton Rouge that I didn't really enjoy are the chicken tenders - they're 60% fried dough and 40% chicken, most people seem to like them though. Finally, the portions are huge so you will never leave hungry."}
{"text":"OK food, but service lacking.

Based on the name, I was expecting something Creole/Louisiana style.  That was not the case.  But, that was fine.  The menu was limited, especially if you were looking for a non-steak option.  We went with the Ribs, and an appetizer order of calamari to be served as dinner.

The food came fast.  I suppose the ribs are cooked for hours on end, so they are ready to go.  The sauce on them was pretty good.  The calamari, which appears on the appetizer menu, didn't come until about 5 minutes after the main entree.  

On food alone, this would have been 3 starts.  But, the service drags them down. Finding the waitress was a bit of a challenge.  And, my dining companion felt that she assumed I was paying, and focused her attention on me while ignoring him.  

Getting a seat on Saturday night was quick, and the place inside was fine.  But, it's probably not a place that would easily get a return trip from us."}
{"text":"Nice place. Great burger. Great chips and spinach dip The french fries could be much better. Beer and wine are a bit pricey but I guess they have a lot of rent to pay at this address.

Would I go there again, probably not, but I'd encourage anyone to try it out."}
{"text":"The steak was excellently grilled. Seasoned perfectly. I had the fries and the baked beans. The beef and barley soup is great. The baked beans were too sweet for my taste. The fries were excellent. And they serve ketchup and mayonnaise to go with the fries. The service was excellent. They charge too much for sparkling water however. Not sure why. 
The atmosphere is quite interesting. Lots of room throughout. This would be an excellent choice for meeting friends or entertaining a group. 
Don't be upset because I didn't tell you that the furniture was a bit worn out. Im telling you now. If that matters to you then skip this place. But it was clean and the furniture was sturdy. I came here to eat, not sit around."}
{"text":"May be this is one of the most preferred restaurants of the Baton Rouge chain and also the most frequented by me. I have been enjoying the signature ribs and the ahi tuna steak for years. In fact rarely bothered trying something different. Perfect place for lunch or happy hour drinks with colleagues. The bar is always busy and lively, that is why I prefer the tables around, but if you are a big group of people you would be easily accommodated in the main section of the restaurant. The bloody caesar feels a little bit on the virgin side, yet it is nice drink with well balanced spiciness and good amount of bunny additions to snack on. Friendly service, nice food, easy access from the highway and free parking, enough reasons to visit if you are wondering where to go in the area."}
{"text":"I've always had a soft spot for Baton Rouge. Maybe it's the memories I've made there in the past ... I don't know. The fries are good. The Louisiana chicken has always been a favorite. Yesterday I tried a new chicken sandwich and I rather enjoyed it. I wish I can give it 3.5 stars. I feel like 3 stars is too little and 4 is too much."}
{"text":"The food is usually really tasty. I ate the chicken on chiabatta bread and it was sooooooooooooo tasty!!!! MMMMMMmmmm..."}
{"text":"I always enjoy this place. The fries are always to die for and the plates are always huge and fulfilling. I always have enough left over to bring home and have it as another full meal. My favorite is always the chicken Louisiana burger. Their Thai salad with peanut dressing is DEFINITELY worth trying!!"}
{"text":"belle endroit pour allez en famille ou en groupe le steack les cotes levé sont très bons et il y a un poulet de languettes frites qui est pas mal non plus très tendres a mangé bien chaud je dois dire qualité prix ça se tiens bien j ai aimé la purée a l ail, comme resto pour service rapide avec familles oui je le conseille vous avez un choix faciles a faire serveur souriant mais surveillez la facture  a notre table ce soir la des erreurs pas qu il vous charge trop cheres mais il se melange de une personnes a l autre pas bien graves on sait ce que l on mange en fait oui je le conseille, faite une reservation si vous etes a plusieurs et je dois dire tu as dela place pour le stationement au carrefour laval"}
{"text":"Excellent food ... When i go back to Montreal in July, I will definitely make a stop here."}
{"text":"For me it's a utilitarian restaurant. I don't go there because I'm in love with it, but because it's practical. This is a chain restaurant that's part of a stable of brand restaurants owned by a \"group\". This means nothing will blow your mind and the food you have at one restaurant will be the same at another franchise. Some brands have great grub like The Keg, you get great steak without having to remortgage your house. Baton Rouge is pretty ordinary. I like it fine. The kids love it. Bu if I want a Baby-back-rib-gasm, I'm a take my bidness elsewhere. Here the ribs are pretty good but nothing mindblowing. Everything else is the same, it's OK but not \"an experience\".

The service is great, the restaurant is super clean and maintained... sadly I was forced to listen to a Bieber song which I was hoping to live my life without hearing Bieber sing once. Damn you Baton Rouge ;) 

3 outta 5"}
{"text":"WHY? WHY? WHY? I used to go to Baton Rouge for the ribs but after living in the US and getting a taste of wood smoked ribs, I was done with utilitarian ribs. This week I went back since there's a Baton Rouge right outside the office with the team. I had forgotten the insane prices at this restaurant for straight a no frills trying to be everything to everyone menu. One shouldn't have to remortgage his home to eat out at lunch.

That being said, it was an office lunch and I was going. This Baton Rouge also has a very nice terrace to eat outside and enjoy the nice summer weather and make you forget you are downtown. The service is acceptable but they fail to distinguish between lunch service and evening service. If your restaurant is between two large corporate glass towers, you know your lunch crowd is a working crowd that doesn't always have time for a long lunch. On to the food...

I ordered the NY steak which is a beautiful cut of meat and also easily prepared. The fat alone can flavor it and it doesn't need much more than some spices. So done deal right? You would be SOOOOOOOOOOOO WRONG. When I got my steak just from the sear marks I could tell that this steak had been constantly thrown around the grill. From the way the fat strip was curling off the meat I could tell the steak had not finished thawing before being grilled - which rendered the meat tasteless. There were no salts, peppers or spices. EPIC FAIL. The potato, and I'm only speculating, tasted like last night's oven baked potato because it was so dry and bland that even the quarter of a cup of sour cream, cheese and bacon dressing on it couldn't save this potato, which also had no seasoning. No third party veggies were made available. Louisiana touch, my ass. Half an ear of corn would have been a nice southern touch with my steak. But there's NOTHING Southern or Cajun on their menu.

I'll blame consumers for this disaster in my plate. Why? Because no one ever bitches and complains about their bad food quality they are being served in restaurants, especially for a 38$ NY steak. Like I said to my colleague and former chef, I can make a 5 dollar strip loin from a super-market into a feast you'll think I got from a pro butcher. I cringe that a restaurant cook can't have steaks at room temperature ready for lunch time - if your boss is too much of a cheap bastard to buy it fresh - and season them appropriately to taste and for the sake of all that is good in life when you drop a steak on a grill, the next time you touch it is to flip it and after that to remove it - stop paddling and twiddling the meat, you will ruin it. Same for a potato. If you can't bake a fucking potato... GO HOME. What's so hard with crusting it with olive oil and coarse salt and make the tatter explode with extra flavor?

Why am I bitching? Cause that plate cost me 38$ plus tip and all I got was a badly prepped steak and an old dry potato. For 30$ I made all 3 Rib-Eyes, Duck Sausage, Beef Ribs and potatoes at home and we foodgasmed for hours. For a single plate at 38$ plus tip, I'm expecting some added value to the experience, not leftovers. What a total complete ripoff to be charged so much dinero for such lack of care and passion. Again another establishment that values form over function. I'd rather eat at a shack that serves me great awesome tasting food in a paper plate than go to an upscale looking restaurant made for corporate power-lunchers but serves me barely edible badly prepared  low quality products.

A lame 1 outta 5 stars"}
{"text":"I love Baton Rouge, I really do! We would always find an occasion to go, to celebrate something, whether it was a birthday, or just going to the mall..

I don't know what happened. Or rather I do: the previous owner wanted to cash out, so he sold the place. It's all downhill from here. The point of going to Baton Rouge was their warm decor, a true steakhouse. Forget about that, the new look is what some middle-aged Porsche-driving CEO probably described as \"classy\" to a boardroom. It's...empty. The doorways are 12 feet tall, the colours are faded. I kept thinking \"Why am I eating in a hangar?\" The new seats can fit 3 people side by side..but will you really need all the space? The saddest thing is that it looks not only bad, but bland. Maybe you are at La Cage, or in one of those new St Huberts? It all looks the same now..

The food is the same, but the menu is a lot smaller... More tellingly, the staff - which I knew from years back - is all gone. Why wouldn't you want to keep people who know your menu back to front? Or rather, why would they leave? Maybe because the new employees are very young and less-demanding...

You have to leave the mall to reach the restaurant, and I wouldn't bother. I know I love their ribs but..I'm sorry. It's so ugly. This is how it ends for me, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent ribs!  Very good for a chain resto.  Also get sweet potato fries instead of regular fries."}
{"text":"My two colleagues and I had a client meeting in Oakville this morning.  Afterwards, we had lunch at Bâton Rouge at Winston Churchill/QEW.

We got there about 12:30pm and it wasn't too busy.

Steve is eating healthy these days and ordered a lunch special ... salad with Bourbon beef.  There was a lotta salad and not a lotta beef.  He did say the beef was good, though.

Helene and I ordered chicken tenders.  I got mine with fries and baked apples.  It was good.  The platter is a big meal and I left a lot of it.

It seemed to take a long time for our food to come.  Our server, Sean, came over to apologize and said there was a mix-up and our food would be out shortly.  About ten minutes later, the manager came over with our food and he too apologized.  I asked if the order had been lost and he said yes.  But he said we could have free dessert or he could take a discount off our bill.  We opted to get dessert to go so Steve could bring the brownies home to his sons.  Plus they didn't charge us for our pops.  Yes, they screwed up but they handled their mistake very graciously."}
{"text":"I flew in to Montreal yesterday morning and flew home today.

It was snowing a bit and I didn't feel like going too far for supper so I went to Bâton Rouge which is close to my hotel.

It was a busy spot and I ended up at a high top table in a corner ... but happy to get it since there was a line-up after I got seated.

I ordered what I usually get there ... chicken tenders with garlic mashed potatoes.  They were really really good.

Despite being so busy, my server took good care of me."}
{"text":"We were reminded once more why we do not usually dine at the Baton Rouge in St-Sauveur.  

Service was courteous but slow and inattentive.  The restaurant was, however, very busy.

The meals all tasted burnt, terrible in fact.  Most of the meals remained in our plates."}
{"text":"I've been many times to this Bâton Rouge. Always got excellent service, and the last time I went (this past week) there was someone to help us to come in and out with our strollers, without even asking for help!

They checked on us so many times to make sure that everything was alright. I love their ribs and their steaks.

Food was good, did not order drinks this time. You can call ahead or book online, mainly on week-ends, it tends to get crowded (it happened only once that we did not have seats)."}
{"text":"Really bland and unremarkable food, especially given the location. We went in with a group and felt rushed the entire evening. The chicken tenders were rubbery and unseasoned even if the batter on top was nice, the burgers were overcooked and the salad with salmon came in the form of a plop of butter lettuce and unseasoned salmon that was also overcooked. Finally, the prices were outrageously high. I would not go back."}
{"text":"I had mixed feeling about this place. Good service , as one expect in a restaurant , welcoming stuff , professional,  however there were something missing in there service, missed some stuff, had to wait 20 min to get somebody explain us about the kids menu. Not a big deal as we were enjoying good mothers days family diner with my visiting parents. As for the food , kids pasta was good, chicken fingers not so great. My daughter didn't finish her first bite, weird mixed flavours in my opinion.  Calamari was very good , well buttered, crispy and good flavours. For main dishes , i enjoyed my Ahi tuna salad , fresh, very good tuna cuts and tasty sauce. Lobster risotto looked better than what it tasted. It wasn't bad  but there was something not quite there. It missed the wow factor and for the price you expect better. Overall it was an ok meal. My parents didn't like it at all nor my kids. Not sure if i come back as i will be more intrigued to try new places in that area."}
{"text":"In general an ok restaurant, i think its overrated as of all chain restaurant with different management. I had good services and really bad ones. Usually its consistent to the location. I like the salads good selection and complex dishes with more than average portions. Sea food pasta is so good generous portion and big size shrimps. Even though its not in my favourite list we end up going there from time to time fir a meal or a gathering with friends. To be clear its not a low end or bad restaurant and meal are fresh and tasty , its just that i am not a big fan of chain restaurant."}
{"text":"A little bit pricey for what your getting, food is ok but not great. Service is good nothing exceptional, food came on time , good quantities. Some of the stuff were friendly, others indifferent. I enjoyed the Boisbriand branch better few months ago."}
{"text":"As per usual...I chose to sit in the Bar because the service is usually better...and it was very good. The Bartender Mike gave us great Service as well as his associate Alyssa.

However, things weren't as good as the service...

First off, we checked in at the host stand and asked if it was ok to sit in the Bar.  The restaurant wasn't busy at that time and there were only 2 occupied tables in the bar at thd time of our arrival. We chose a nice booth so that we could watch the Jay's game on their TV's. Just as we were about to place our drink order, one of the Hostesses that was at the host stand when we arrived, came to our table and told us that they had a big reservation which was to occupy all the booths at 630pm. It was 530pm at the time. She asked us to move and since we had no choice, we moved. I wasn't aware you could reserve tables in the bar...but who knows. They should have either told us before we sat down or been better prepared with RESERVED signs. Honestly...her attitude was a bit pathetic.

Mike graciously apologized and took our order. Before he left the table he had apologized at least 3x. Felt bad for him. He brought drinks and as per the norm, a runner brought the appetizer - spinach dip. This dish came with a bowl of spinach dip surrounded by tortilla chips plain -$14??? Really? Oh the also brought out a tiny plate with 2 ramekins of sour cream and salsa... Gee!!Wow!!.

My BFF ordered 10oz Ribs with Caeser Salad and I ordered 8oz Top Sirloin Steak with fully loaded baked potato and Caeser Salad. I asked for Veggies as well for an additional charge.

Then came our Caesar Salads...basic and rather bland but we got charged only $3 for one salad and N/C for the other...so I guess that's ok for the lack of flavor and presentation???

A runner showed up at our table with another order of spinach dip and stopped, realizing we already had our order she muttered something towards the bar and left.

While we were waiting, a group arrived and sat down. Alyssa brought them water and suddenly they got up and left...strange but true.

Our Entree arrived as we finished the appetizers and looked ok.  The ribs fell off the bone nicely, but lacked flavor. The coleslaw that came with it came in a very small almost ramekin like bowl...not very exciting. The plate looked like it was missing something.  My Entree had a massive baked potato with a little cheese and a small dollop of sour creme. The steak was medium well, overcooked on one side, not medium as I requested.  The veggies were dry and had zero flavor. Some parts of the steak were chewy and didn't have the expected flavor. I didn't finish the potato and veggies. Even with the provided steak sauce, pepper wasn't enough to give the food that little spark it should have had.

Mike did not charge for my 2nd pint to make up for the seating inconvenience which at $8/pint, was a nice gesture.  

Again, Service was good,  but good? I can cook better than that.

Maybe next time,  I'll stay home and cook. I can give myself good service for a lot less $$$.  Bill was $94.07 + 15% tip (based on the taxed amount). 

Oh, a family came in at 615 and took the booth we were sitting at. Then a completely separate group came and took the 2nd booth and finally, at 630 another completely unrelated group took the 3rd booth. RESERVED??? I THINK NOT.

Will I return? Probably not. Definitely not worth that kind of money.  Sorry Baton Rouge..."}
{"text":"Comme Ci comme ca. Mixed salad was ok.  Caesar not bad but way too much dressing.  Salmon wasn't great.   Not a high quality piece of fish.   Service was fast and good but with no flexibility. Not good for kids only three choices."}
{"text":"my First experience at a Baton Rouge was for my fiance and my 6 year anniversary.

Our anniversary is our excuse to go get some steak in our belly's. We decided to steer away from our regular routine of another steakhouse that will remain nameless, because I don't want to side track away from the rouge, and I think we made a good choice. 

The food was sooooo good. we had the spinach dip to share, as well as a Caesar salad(which was mostly mine..lol). For my main I went for the classic top sirloin, medium done of course (kept it simple) while the fiance ordered the seafood linguine, both were made to almost perfection. 

I would recommend this place for a birthday dinner or an occasion for sure, or even just a nice dinner and movie date night(side note: cineplex theaters is right beside this location). 

The service was on point, never had to ask for refill for my drink , its like they read my mind and I love when the service is like that. The Manager came over and helped us pack our left over which was awesome, I think the service was top notch!

I would definitely come here again, but maybe for a birthday dinner something of that sort."}
{"text":"Les tendre aux poulet pas vraiment tendre   plutot  croustillant et très très sec.   Même après l avoir dit a notre serveur plutôt absent que présent, il nous a charger quamd même le plat qui m'a même pas été toucher.

Il a bien mérité son gros 5$ de pourboir sur une facture de 120$.

Vraiment ont passe et ont ne reviens pas..."}
{"text":"We decided to celebrate Canada Day for lunch at Baton Rouge and left very happy. :) I decided to get steak frites, my mom got the grilled salmon salad, my sister the seared ahi tuna steak and my niece the kids' chicken fingers (all pictures below). We also had the spinach dip as an app, but I don't have a picture for it. However it was delicious! 

My mom and sister absolutely loved their entrees and said they would order it again. In fact, they both asked for the lemon ginger dressing and we took some with us to go. As for my steak frites... It was an underwhelming piece of steak. It barely had any taste and I kept dipping it in the gravy sauce that came along with it and in the chipotle mayo. That is why I gave this review only 4 stars. I'm just very happy everyone else enjoyed their lunch.

The service was very good. I unfortunately cannot remember the girl's name, I think it may have been Marcella or something close to that. Regardless, she was very nice and took great care of our table. 

I would definitely come back for dinner here again! :)"}
{"text":"Why did we go back?

Last year we were at the Montreal Jazz Festival and needed to eat.  We were not impressed with the food or prices.  The location is perfect for enjoying festival music and the beer is not incredibly overpriced, but nearly $20 for a shrimp caesar salad was excessive.

We went back this year because it was late and most places had closed.  The chicken tenders were overly breaded and gooey.  Again, the prices were high.

If you have the chance travel out of the festival area into Chinatown for some tasty dumplings."}
{"text":"I came here for the beers at happy hour in the bar only. The bartender was friendly and the beer was good and quite reasonable at prices"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with a friend. Made reservations via open table with no issues on arrival. I had the Caesar salad which was nice and creamy and the chipotle chicken sandwich which I really enjoyed. It's on the pricy side but the food and service were both good. I do recommend."}
{"text":"Have eaten at a few Baton Rouges in Ottawa and Montreal - this was the worst.  After getting our lunch food, which was OK but expensive, we were abandoned by the wait staff.  It was about 130pm.  We did not get refills on drinks.  We could not get the plates cleared.  We could not get the bill.  Finally I went to the back of the restaurant where the wait staff seemed to be having lunch, got the bill, and paid it."}
{"text":"Don't know why I've stayed away from this place up until now. But I'm sure glad I made it in for lunch today! 

There are really great lunch specials - you get soup, tea or coffee, plus your main item, all for under $20.

Today's soup was cream of broccoli.  I really enjoyed it - it was the right consistency, not too thin or think and really yummy. I also got the portobello and goat cheese burger, and sweet potato fries ($1 extra).  It was really good.  The portion size was quite big too, I had trouble finishing everything. 

The kids meals were decent but too. $10 for a drink, side, main dish and dessert. 

The service was fabulous. Our waitress was really friendly and explained everything well. Only towards the end, the restaurant got busier and we had to wait for our bill for a bit. 

But overall, this was a great dining experience. I will definitely come back and check it out again!"}
{"text":"I would definitely come back just to order the fries. They are simply amazing. Like nonstop gorging. 

Ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich $15 with a side of fries. Not bad, chicken was alright but a bit of a mess to eat. Can't say its got that X factor.

Friends had the ribs which was in my opinion meh as I've had better at Smash. They said its been a lot better before. 

Quick service and the place was quiet."}
{"text":"This specific Baton Rouge has always been a disappointment for me and I didn't come here by choice since I had friends in town and we were headed to the hockey game.

This is where the problem lies.

This place is EXTREMELY popular on game nights with a line-up stretching outside into the rain of over 100 patrons during game nights. They know it and they exploit it when they provide an \"Event Night\" catalog that limits you to the most expensive options they can such as an $18 burger and fries being one of the cheaper \"meals\" available.

Gone are the other good options such as the chicken salad or chicken tenders, here are all the shrimp, duck, BBQ rib options for nearly $30+. NY Steak for $38? Really??

What a rip-off.

Take a long moment to read more reviews on this place and make sure you REALLY want to come to this Baton Rouge, particularly if there's an event going on at the Bell Center.

Mind you I'm a huge fan of this chain and regularly go to the Laval one where prices are 30-40% less, the portions are bigger and the selection is unhindered.

I ordered the Burger and fries and they were decent. I'm a huge fan of the fries the burger was decently cooked though the waiter never bothered to ask me how I'd like to have my burger.

The meals are provided very quickly and the staff LOVES to fill your soda to the top with ice. I made sure she confirmed with me refills are allowed before I let her serve me my drink.

All in all, in the particular experience, it sucked. I wanted my chicken tenders. Couldn't have them. Settled for something less and still felt ripped off."}
{"text":"Our party of four was seated at a window booth (with a great view of Ste. Catherine St. and Place des Arts, but cool - temperature wise - in winter).

I was curious as to what it would be like to eat here again after many years and wondered why the 3 star yelp rating? 

A few of my observations are as follows in no order of importance;

Coleslaw was a bit more creamy and chopped up than I recall. Still one of my fave cabbage based dishes anywhere. 

Our server asked if we wanted a break between courses, but was hard to find after dessert to settle up the cheque. Note: was not made clear to pay at the table (usually that's done).

The manager was very present and helpful when called upon, a very good sign.

Two of my go to dishes; the baby back ribs (pretty obvious as they are in so many of their ads and tops in my experience), and the other is their grilled salmon. This time the portion was smaller than I recalled, the veggies were cold (yet still edible) and the garlic mashed potatoes lukewarm. The $1 add-on spicy seasoning was fairly hard to discern. 

The others in our party all order their famous ribs with or without additions. They did appear, a little less meaty, a little more dry - than years past - but still darn tasty.

Honey mustard chicken finger dipping sauce is excellent.

The side of (3) grilled Tiger shrimp were plump and cooked firmly.

The calamari starter was a little chewy and not a plate-full-portion.

The cheddar dip was very rich and flavourful, plus a good appetizer to share.

You can get a parking (underneath the restaurant) validation if your bill is over $65 after 5pm and on weekends (please verify the details as they could change).

The 6 oz glass of 'Carnivor' Cabernet Sauvignon was super drinkable and at $12 a decent deal - many of their other glasses are $15. Several bottles seemed to be marked at $60 plus tax which I though was a little pricey, yet if the glass is $15...

To finish their cranberry red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting was moist, 'delish' and sharable with each an individual fork. 

In sum, the three star average seems a bit harsh, but to each their own experience and rating...that's for sure."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday with my family to celebrate an anniversary and I left feeling like I 'swallowed a bowling ball'.  We ordered our own mains, I had the ribs and chicken entree.  The ribs were a little sweeter than i remembered but the meat fell off the bones and were cooked well.  The chicken was not only miniscule, but somewhat dry.  I only ate a small piece.  For an appetizer, we shared the family seafood platter which contained grilled calamari, scallops and fried calamari.  It was ok.  Nothing special other than a little olive oil marinade on top.  We also had the spinach appetizer which was way too runny and the chips were 'meh.  Overall, I left unimpressed.  The menu has been the same for years.  They used to be great but other places caught up, and surpassed, this restaurant.  They seriously need to re-vamp the menu.  Service was good.  Attentive but not obtrusive."}
{"text":"I went on the one on  Rue de la Montagne for a business lunch. I was surprised that they do not have a coat check-in!!! The amvmbience is quite predictable and boring. The service is good. The menu doesn't have many options for people who do not eat steak. I ordered one of their chicken salads. Nothing spectacular, very average but overly priced chicken salad!!
Thankfully, I was not paying for the lunch :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very well organized and clean. The staff is very friendly. This establishment serves higher end food which can be a bit pricey. While dining here I had the crab cake appetizers, which was two big crab cakes with balsamic vinaigrette drizzle plated very nicely. Although I do think it was a little on the bland side. I also ordered the spinach dip which was good though I feel it was a bit runny but very tasty. For my main course I ordered the chipotle grilled chicken breast with an order of double fries. The chicken was superb and not an ounce bit dry, the seasonings where on point. It came topped with corn salsa, Monterey Jack cheese and bacon. Would definitely not mind going there again."}
{"text":"Best ribs in town for the price. Go for the lunch menu: Soup, an awesome burger and a drink for only $14. Can't go wrong with that. Service sometimes very nice, sometimes so-so"}
{"text":"Nice quiet classy dining with an expected $$$ price!  I didn't realize this was a chain I suppose in Canada?  I was expecting some maybe Cajun style cuisine but was disappointed.  But my filet was fairly tender and had a good taste.  Good solid service with plenty of attention to my needs and wants.  I'd return again at a later date."}
{"text":"Pretty much everybody from Montreal have been to Baton Rouge which is a Cajun, Texas, American cuisine. It's a Franchise that came here over 10 years ago. I've been there 3-4 times, each time I was happy with my meal but angry with my tab. Maybe I'm picky but when I pay 50$ + and I got served some fries, I want some REAL HOME FRIES not some Frozen Home Fries. The burger are alright but pretty much the same thing you'd get at any american Diner but for 15$. The ribs (full rack of baby back ribs) are amazing and the meat is tasty. That's the best thing in Bâton Rouge. The desert are pretty good too but overall, it's pretty expensive and it gets to a point where you're thinking: I should go to FortyWestt and pay the double for some Real Quality."}
{"text":"My third time at Baton Rouge and this time it was finally a solid one, the baby pork ribs were really good as well as the ahi tune, but the the kids meals were pretty bad, huge unnecessary proportions, full of oil and tasted like its a Microwave heated dinner."}
{"text":"The food is ok but I think if they were to cut their portions down and cut their prices as well it would be a better value.  I find you get way too much food and end up leaving a huge chunk of it behind.  It's also a little on the pricey side for what it is.  The ribs are pretty good though as is the burger.  I also find the noise level to be too high in this location making it hard to enjoy conversation with your dining companions."}
{"text":"J'étais venue il y a très longtemps avec ma fille. Ses côtes levées étaient sèchent et le gérant les avaient remplacées. Cette fois-ci, en mai 2012, elles me furent servis froides!!! Le garcon de table st venu lorsque mon assiette étaient au 2/3 terminé...

Bien que non facturée, cette fois -ci, c, est ma derniere visite!!!

Dommage car j'aime le décor de bois foncé et de cuir rouge. Avec les petite lampes verte sur la table...

Mais le décor n'est pas suffisant.!!!! J,ai regardé les critiques sue urbanspoon qui donn 48%.. j'aurais dû lire avant.... 

À éviter tant et aussi longtemps quIls n'auront pas un contrôle de qualité!!! C'est toujours ben pas sorcier faire réchauffer des côtes levées, non????

Encore une fois, à éviter...."}
{"text":"Better late then never, first attempt got deleted by a server error, but here goes again.
Baton Rouge Anjou is is always beaming with noise as it's always packed but none the less the atmosphere is cozy! 

Baton Rouge isn't only about great Ribs & Chicken!
I went 2 Thursdays ago welcomed by a 15-20 minute wait expectancy however was seat in a nice comfy 2 person booth in 5-10 minutes which is really good for the busiest shopping weeknight!
In minutes I was attended to, drink and supper was ordered. I ordered the Roast Beef sandwich was prepared to perfection and on my table with in minutes. 

The sandwich comes in a soft baguette top with caramelized onions and oozing melted mozzarella cheese and is accompanied by fries(thin and tasty) and an INSANELY tasty brown sauce(I believe the sauce from the cooked roast beef).

The first bite of the sandwich dipped in the sauce was mind blowing and the anticipation of that next bite inexplicable! To truly understand you'll have to experience this sandwich for your self.

I ordered a coke with the meal and by 3/4 of the way through as I was on the last sip another full glass was brought to my table before I had a chance to put the glass down and even ask for another (Free Re-Fills!) Now that is attentive service and thru my visit I experienced that the whole both the waiters and waitress. They work as a group and love their work and make that very obvious!!

The restaurant does have a bar and television so there is more to Baton Rouge than just a great meal.

I give it 4 stars only for the noise level, it does not distract you from the tasty food but if you are going with someone and tend on having a conversation....it probably be a loud one lol(talking above the noise).

my whole meal with cokes. $ 21.80 tax in!, tip extra"}
{"text":"This place was across the street from my Airbnb. I went there because I needed a quick bite before I went to bed.  The menu had a nice selection of bar-like food. I had the calamari. The calamari was good, but this place is no more than a French version of Applebee's."}
{"text":"I went here on Superbowl night with my GF and her parents. The last time I came here was around Jan of 2011 so it's been a year. I remember not having my steak cooked very well at this time. But my memory of it is blurry. We could tell immediately that our server was new. He was being shadowed by another server. He was trying really hard to nice and was using words such as 'magnificent choice', 'exquisite' and 'wonderful'. A little too much for me but he's obviously trying to impress since he's new to the job. 

There's a good selection of menu items. I decided to have the salmon filet because I had a steak the night before. I choose fries and beans as a side and it came with a garden salad on the side. There's a lot of value in the meal for what you get. My gfs brother double the fries. The fries tasted great! I was impressed by just that. The salmon was moist and cooked nicely. My GF got 10oz ribs for $20 and that was nice and meaty. Her parents shared a steak with chicken that looked really yummy and enough for them to get full. 

We were really happy with our experience and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Je suis allée au Bâton Rouge de Boucherville hier soir en famille et j'accorde un 3 étoiles notre soirée. Tout d'abord, nous avons été placés dans la section bar, ce qui faisait en sorte que la musique était très forte et visait clairement les jeunes (j'ai 27 ans, mais je trouvais la musique assez jeune quand même!). En entrée, j'ai pris la salade César. Elle était goûteuse, mais un peu trop d'ail à mon goût! La langue me brûlait un peu à la fin! Je ne l'ai pas fini. En plat principal, j'ai pris le haut de surlonge avec fromage de chèvre et noix de Grenoble, accompagné de patates pilées à l'ail et de légumes. La cuisson de la viande était bonne, mais la pièce de viande avait beaucoup de gras et de tirailles. C'était donc assez désagréable. Les noix de Grenoble étaient de trop. Aucune valeur ajoutée. Les patates étaient goûteuses, mais avaient beaucoup de \"motons\" et le goût d'ail devenait trop intense à la longue. La sélection de legumes était intéressante. Plein de carottes, fèves vertes, courges et courgettes. Belle portion de légumes bien apprêtés. En résumé, j'ai apprécié mon plat au goût, mais la qualité de la viande était décevante (à 30$ pour mon assiette, je m'attendais à plus)."}
{"text":"We were here a Friday evening to celebrate a birthday. Luckily we were able to get a last minute reservation and were seated in a more private area of the restaurant, what looks like an extension into the adjoining mall.

Baton Rouge would never be my top dinner pick as I am not a huge fan of steaks or ribs, so I opted for chicken tenders. Unfortunately the menu is pretty limited if you are not a big meat eater. There's a couple burgers, chicken, some overpriced but tiny fish (tuna/salmon) selection, and 1 pasta option.

The chicken tenders were the worse I've ever had. I was expecting a soft battered variety similar to Scores, St-Hubert or even Mcdonalds but there were hard and they were deep fried into a messy battered ball. I thought it was fish and chips when I first got the plate as they look deformed and very greasy.
Served with your choice of sides, the thin shoestring fries are disappointing, the pilaf rice was cold and the side of vegetables my friends got were very boring steamed carrots and brussel sprouts. It looked like hospital food.

I expected something more elevated coming from Baton Rouge but I found out the food is expensive for such poor quality and the service that night really sucked. Not a single \"happy birthday\" from our waitress or anything special such as a free desert or drink that so many other restaurants offer on birthdays. We were rushed and made to feel bad for taking time picking out our menu options.

Baton Rouge doesn't even serve complimentary bread and butter to start off your meal?! These are extra touches that make a huge difference for me. If I'm choosing a steakhouse next time for the same price and far better service I will opt for The Keg or just about anything else.

Stay away from this overpriced chain, steak and ribs are easy to find so there is no reason to settle for such lack luster food and service."}
{"text":"Great place, good people, great service, good crowd. Surprisingly busy almost on a daily basis, especially the bar side. Not too pricey for the quality. A nice place to hang out after a day of work or even just for lunch. Steaks are amazing. Great place."}
{"text":"Hard to say how I feel about this location. I've checked in with yelp over 23 times I believe. It's the location I hate less in the Montréal area. The food prep reliability factor is high ( meaning if you order the same meal over different visit ) it's probably why we come back so often. These days when you just want comfort food ( I consider theirs potatoes soup and the chiken tender as such)

Also it's one of the rare place that get 'Pittsburgh rare' fine. 

But the service ? Very uneven and the speed too. It make me sometime hesitate to go. 

But like some weird relationship I'll go back"}
{"text":"The Old Scott House has a new look...and alternate name Bâton Rouge. 

There are a number of rooms sectioned off. You can go to the bar, you can go to a smaller sitting area or you can be seated in the main dining room. The setup reminds me of the Keg. 

There was a one page wine list on the menu. A wide variety moderately priced. The menu had entrees, appetizers, soups, salad, pretty standard. 

The did have a list of steak cuts and seafood available ranging from $15-35. 

I tasted the prime rib. Pretty good. 

I ordered:
BBQ Rib Trio 
Can't decide between ribs, chicken or shrimp? Have it all!
10 oz. of our signature pork back ribs, 6 oz. marinated grilled chicken breast, and 5 grilled jumbo shrimp basted with our own BBQ sauce 

It was all cooked well and moist inside. The downside was that everything had the same sauce. Could have done with some variety of flavours that way. 

Full bar. I had beer. I had whiskey. Unsure of the prices, but if you're going to this place, don't hold back."}
{"text":"Service impeccable. Bonne bouffe. Si quelque chose ne vous convient pas, ce n'est pas long qu'on vient s'occuper de vous. Nous l'avons maintenant adopté. Bravo à l'équipe de Boucherville!"}
{"text":"Decent food for a decent price. Won't hesitate when invited for a meal here. Or when choosing somewhere to eat with a group. 

It will usually satisfy most palettes within a group of people. 

Had the prime rib au jus. Did not disappoint."}
{"text":"My husband and I go here often. The service is good and the food is always cooked properly. It is never outstanding but you can always assure you will have a well cooked meal with flavor."}
{"text":"Baton Rouge is the kind of restaurant you go to if you want to have a good steak or Ribs with group of friends. To me, the quality of the meat is rather good, but the sides are not amazing. For example, vegetables will never be presented in a nice way and most of the time won't have any taste. I also find that it's quite pricey for what it is and that you pay more for the decoration, the atmosphere, than for the food. I would recommend this place though if you want to have a good dinner with friends or a not too expensive date. 
Ribs are pretty good and in large quantity, the lobster is a good option as well. Finally, get a desert because that is something that is worth going for sure."}
{"text":"Ils ont mis du maïs dans mon risotto... Le service était long. La clim trop forte. Je suis déçue."}
{"text":"This review will mainly focus on customer service, the food in this restaurant is very average.  We got to the place at around 7pm Saturday, a very kind older gentleman showed us to our seat.  Later i found out that he is the restautant manager.  While waiting for our food, which by the way took around 30 min or more to come. I could see the restaurant manager walk around and engage customers with conversation and just acknowledging them.  You dont see that a lot.  When our food finally came, the manager came to us and said that our main was on the house, because of the very long wait.  Those main he was talking about was worth atleast $70. I really thought that was a really nice gesture by him.  After eating the mediocore food, our server said that we can also have dessert on the house and because of the wait we had to endure.  Never in my life was a i given a free meal in a restaurant before. It was really nice of the manager to acknowledge their mistake and make ammends with the customer.  Now that is customer service."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of chain restaurants and this is no exception.   Our reservation was for 9:00 pm and although our party was assembled, the table was in no danger of being ready.   In fact, by the time we were seated  it was 10:20.  Thankfully we received complimentary glasses of water to hold us over.   Once we were seated, we were also comped chips and dip, which made us collectively less hangry.   

My steak was reminiscent of shoe leather but Albert, our server, brought me a new one promptly.  My son's Ahi tuna was bland due to the lack of lime ginger sauce that was supposed to accompany it.

All in all, the foul up with our reservation was not properly handled in my opinion and this cast a shadow on what could have been a pleasant evening.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend to celebrate his birthday. We ordered the coconut shrimp for an app, and I ordered the prime rib for an entree. We waited an acceptable time for our food to arrive. The coconut shrimp was tasty. The prime rib left more to be desired. Compared to the Keg, it was not as tender. It was a little tough around the sides and lacked horseradish. The accompanying coleslaw was pretty bland. We finished our meal with a Creme Brûlée. It must have been refrigerated and then microwaved, the centre was cold and the outside hot. The top was burnt more than needed. Overall, it was OK. But I'll be going to the Keg next time."}

Un retour de vacances avec un besoin viscéral de manger des bonnes côtes-levées, rien de fancy, ... direction : Bâton Rouge sur Taschereau. On sait à quoi s'attendre. Je me pointe vers 20h10. Le service se fait très bien, tout le monde est de bonne humeur. Pour un samedi soir, c'est parfait, c'est ce qu'on veut voir.
Je débute avec un excellent PinaColada, pas trop fort sur le rum Captain Morgan, mais bien crémeux en noix de coco et arôme d'ananas, tamisé d'une infinité de petits cristaux de glace, la parfaite mixture, ahhhh le bonheur. Encore mieux, l'un de mes anciens étudiants me l'apporte ! Quelle surprise ! La soirée commence bien :-)

Je commande un combo côtes-levées et lanières de poulet. Ohhhhhhh ! Mais quel délice ces petites lanières !!! Les côtes parfaites comme à l'habitude :-) Mais la panure de ces lanières est vraiment incroyable. C'est à la limite de la tempura sans surcroustillance, très léger en bouche mais bien croquant sous la dent. Oh, j'ai presque le goût d'en redemander. Une montagne de frites super minces et parfaitement croustillantes accompagnent le plat.

Comme dessert, je me laisse tenter par la mousse au chocolat en pensant que ce sera un petit bol de mousse délicate et chocolatée. Le verre de 12 onces arrive devant moi ! Aïe Aïe Aïe ! C'est entre le Jell-O pudding et la crème fouettée au chocolat. La mousse est décorée de copeaux de chocolat blanc mouillée d'un filet de confiture à la framboise et de sirop Hershey. Je vous mets au défi de terminer complètement le contenu du verre ! Un tout petit Espresso vient couronner le tout.

Back from the holidays with a need for pork ribs, nothing fancy... head for : Bâton Rouge on Taschereau. You know what you're gonna get. I'm in, 20h10. Excellent service, fast and curtious, happy faces everywhere, nice saturday in mind. I start with a cool PinaColada, not too \"rummy\" on Captain Morgan, super creamy on coco and pineapple and cooled by an infinite number of small ice crystals. HEAVEN !. Even better, one of my former students is bringing me the drink :-)

I order a rib and chicken fingers combo. Ohhhhhh ! Those chicken fingers are out of this world !!! The ribs are perfect as always :-)  But the fingers are slightly coated with an almost tempura-like batter, not over fried, light in the mouth but still crunchy. Oh, I almost need to ask for more. A mountain of fries come with my order, super thin and still crunchy outside and tender inside.

For dessert, I let myself go for a chocolate mousse. The 12 oz glass comes on the table ! Aïe Aïe Aïe ! It's between Jell-O pudding and whipped chocolate cream. It is decorated with white chocolate pieces, strawberry jelly and Hershey chocolat. I dare you to finish the whole thing ! A simple Espresso tops the meal."}

No one has bothered to reach out to me since then, so they clearly are either too busy with other complaints or mgmt really doesn't care to discuss what my opinions are or attempt to find out how they can improve, really too bad, as this used to be one of my most favored beef restaurants in the city,"}

Baby staff, running around with the restaurant half full. First hostess dressed in lingerie, unfriendly. Food below par. Waiter disappeared for 20 min; asked to walk to the bar to pay with credit card; handed over a tiny Styrofoam container for me to pack the food. The restaurant was cold and drafty. Nothing good to say about it. Maybe that it's a five star McDonald's.  True. Do not go! Better sevice, food and environment for the same money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great service! Busy Saturday and we were seated quickly. Food was delicious and drinks as well. Definately recommend !"}
{"text":"customer service was great. our server was attentive and friendly and I think he was also our bartender at one point lol.. the special was Lobster this week. we had the steak with Lobster tail.. and paired it with a  ice Shiraz glass of wine. the other cocktail was a Tiki Muse.. I think that's what it was called. Overall I loved the food and service was great. From our hotel we walked there so it was easy to get there. not sure about driving. public transportation and public bikes may be am alternative way to get there. But... i didn't see any bike stations directly near it. maybe an Uber? Price was decent for the meal. I would recommend this place... I'd go back but I'm not from Montréal and would like to visit other restaurants. Perhaps on another visit here I'll return. Hope your visit here is as pleasant as mine was!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located restaurant. The service was quite slow, and the kitchen seemed behind, although there was no crowd. Despite this, our server was very cheery and personable, given the situation. The food was just average, but negative points on the freshness of the salmon. Overall, average!"}

I always sat in the bar area & tried many different dishes - ribs are a must have - tender & tasty, crisp sweet potato fries with a dangerous dipping sauce, loaded baked potatoes, grilled salmon, & lobster ravioli.   Bartenders were very friendly and not only worked the bar but also the booths in the bar area.   Fantastic wine pours & great dessert offerings!"}

{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for lunch the other day. The service was amazing, our waiter kept checking up on us! We both ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. Let's just say.. It was delicious!! We will def. be back :)"}
{"text":"Vous avez besoin d'une énorme dose de légumes et de viande? La Bâton Rouge devrait faire l'affaire. Demandez un à côté de légumes et vous recevrez une tête de brocoli au complet! Vous préférez les côtes levées? Pas de problème. N'oubliez pas que même si on dirait qu'Il n'y a qu'une seule bonne portion, quelques côtes d'extra se cachent habituellement sous celles que vous pouvez voir.

J'aime particulièrement le service vu que tous les serveurs s'occupent de toutes les tables. Avez-vous remarqué que même si un serveur prend votre commande de boissons et qu'un autre les emmènes, le deuxième saura très bien quel verre a été commandé par quelle personne? Assez impressionnant quand même!

C'est une bonne alternative pour ceux qui préfèrent prendre le temps de souper avant un match de hockey ou un spectacle au Centre Bell. Pour les prix de 2 hot-dogs et une bière au Centre Bell, vous pourriez manger un repas complet au Bâton Rouge.  Les prix sont quand même modérés, et bien que j'aime bien cette chaîne canadienne, je pense que j'y suis allée un petit peu trop souvent pour trouver ça extra spécial."}
{"text":"Very happy with our most recent visit (last Saturday night). A group of 4 decided to give them a go for their rib special, but we decided on going on a Saturday night and this place is notorious for their no reservation rule...so we were prepared to stand in line and be at the mercy of a hostess. Much to our surprise, we visited their website and they now take reservations for Friday and Saturday nights. A reservation was made for 7:00pm and when we arrived at the restaurant, the line-up was huge. We went to the hostess station, advised them that we were there and in less than 5 minutes we were seated. FANTASTIC !
We started with the artichoke dip.....still great and very, very good.
3 people ordered the ribs, I ordered the Louisiana Chicken (which had grilled veggies, jus, and goat cheese).
Appetizer was out in within a reasonable time frame....warm nachos with their signature artichoke/cheese dip. If you've never had it you don't know what you're missing. It comes with sour cream and salsa on the side.
Our meals came out a few minutes after we devoured the dip.....
The three ppl who ordered the ribs said they were fantastic, although one of the plates came out with no fries (which were ordered). This was quickly corrected when pointed out to the runner (the person who brought the food out). She returned within a minute with fries on a separate plate. 
My chicken was perfect....seasoned nicely with an ample amount of veggies and goat cheese. Portion size has shrunk, but this is a more reasonable size (as it was next to impossible to finish the previous portion size). Only two slight complaints....1) they've changed their baked beans and I prefer the older style better (it had a much robust flavour), and 2) there was barely any seasoning salt on the fries (which everyone at the table who ordered fries noticed). 
Overall, food is great, server was busy so we didn't see him much (there was a table celebrating a birthday and they consisted of about 30 ppl), so he was hopping. 
Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Here's a case where I wish they had half stars cause I would give it 3.5 stars!! Our waiter was great.  So attentive.  Gave us a run down of the menu.  Also explained the specials.  I got the 20 ounce cowboy steak rare.  Came with 2 sides.  I went for a upcharge and got the house salad and the seasonal veggies.  They were great. My steak was over cooked for my liking but it was still full of flavor.  My husband got the NY strip with shrimp special.  He said it was great and his shrimp were huge.  My daughter got the burger.  The service made it very pleasant.  Never had to wait for a refill or wait for something. Dessert was good.  Peanut butter and chocolate cheesecake.  And a ultimate chocolate brownie.  They said it was good.  I was too full to try !"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It has more of a classy, casual ambiance to it. Lighting is dim at dinner time which makes it a nice romantic spot to take a date.

FOOD: Always loved the food at Baton Rouge. Their baked potatoes and ribs are a definite fave for me. I also really enjoy their chicken tenders. They aren't soggy or too crunchy. Perfect texture. And they go especially well with the sauces that they come with. For the salads (as an appetizer), I definitely prefer their mixed greens salads over their Caesar. I would definitely recommend this place.

PRICE: Decent prices for the quality and quantity of food that you'll be getting. There's definitely more affordable places out there. However, I wouldn't go here too often, you'll go broke fast. Maybe only on special occasions.

SERVICE: Service in the West Island is always great. They are attentive to you and make sure that everything is to your liking."}
{"text":"I now have a love-hate relationship with this place. *sigh*
The first time I went back in 2005, I was impressed for a few reasons, the first one being that a nice, high end restaurant would be in the West Island, and that it would do well.
So when I planned my visit to Montreal just a few weeks ago, my sister and I decided this would be a great place to get together with my dearest MTL girls. We made plans for 20 and gave them a month's notice. No problem. 20 people, on a Friday night at 630. Awesome.

LOVE.

A few days before the event, they called my sister (who was the main contact since she's local), and told her that we needed to vacate by 830. 
That's when they lost me. 
Are you EFFING KIDDING ME?! I bring you 20 people for dinner and drinks on a Friday night and you give us a two hour window?
... it's almost as if they hate money or something.
My sister told them that it was ridiculous and that we couldn't do that because of potential late arrivals and you know, the fact that this place is pricey and we were putting down good money. 

HATE.

We arrived as scheduled and when we got there, the tables were ready to go. We were seated and everything was great as my guests started to arrive.

LOVE.

Until it was time to order, when our waiters were MIA. And so went the night, highs and lows, including when the food came out fast (LOVE) and when a few guests were late, the staff asking us to consolidate tables (HATE). We did stay past our 830 \"deadline\" - but as the night went on and we wanted dessert, coffee, tea, etc, it was such a pain to get a waitress (HATE).

I know, I know: TL;DR -- this sums it up. If you're going to grab dinner, this place is fine. If you want to host an event here, don't. I know I won't, and neither will all of my guests who were equally unimpressed with Baton Rouge."}
{"text":"I was surprised at the smaller menu when I was there but understood why it had to be that way. It is hard to serve that many items on a menu when you have so many people from all the festivals and events nearby.  However, I have an issue about the lobster poutine. I had ordered that as an appetizer and was surprised that instead of the lobster bisque sauce, gravy was used. The waitress told me that lobster shells were used to make the gravy but I had this at another location. Gravy was not used. Please change the menu to say gravy instead.

Other issues, they were confused about who ordered what plate. My sirloin steak did not have the garden vegetables.
I have had better service at other locations."}
{"text":"I love Bâton Rouge. In the field of corporate steakhouses I feel that Bâton Rouge is the most consistent. The ribs are simply amazing and their Red Velvet cake is out of this world!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give it 0 stars, I would. Not a single dish was fresh or good for that matter. Clearly Baton Rouge used to be good but as all legends fall, they probably switched their management and food to save money from the decline in popularity. Oh yeah, and the goddamn waiter hassled me for a tip. I'm sorry sir, does your wage not pay you enough to the point where you have to ask for extra money from teenage girls who are clearly just tourists?"}
{"text":"Baton Rouge West Island is the tastiest of all other Baton Rouge restaurants. The classic are the ribs. Its impossible not to like them. I also like to order the small caesar salad. Potato soup is pretty good if you like thick soups. Please bring back the key lime pie!!!!! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was going to go to Cage aux Sports to watch the game, but they were full. BR was the back-up. They really need to upgrade their bar section. The televisions should be bigger. The steak I had was supposed to be medium rare, but was inedible. I had to send the steak back to be better cooked. When the steak came back, the steak was chalky.This is not good for a steak house. I only wrote this review, so that I remember to never go back."}
{"text":"We had our Christmas dinner here on Friday and we are blown away by the service and food of this restaurant. Every year we usually go to the keg but we decided to switch it up since Baton Rouge's menu has a bigger selection and we were not disappointed. We had everything from the chicken to their burgers and steak and chicken tenders and everything was phenomenal. 

My dad ordered the classic steak with Cajun rub and asked for medium and when they brought it out it was more medium well and we made a little comment not a big deal at all either way it was good and the manager (Yvon) came and offered another steak to be cooked exactly to my dad's liking. He came back several more times to make sure we were enjoying our meal and everything was perfect. 

Our waiter was a gentleman named David who was very pleasant and always refilled our drinks without being asked and just so polite and we had great conversation. 

We honestly didn't have any expectations (good or bad) going to this place and I am so overjoyed with their service and the quality of their food that I will be coming here again and recommending it to my friends without hesitation. The fact that this happened around Christmas truly made everything so much more special. 

Also I forgot to mention we were a party of 6 and we had to make reservations. We wanted 6:30 but when I called they didn't have an opening until 7:30 but 20 mins later a male worker called us back and somehow fit us in for 6:30 so basically this dinner was already off to a great start before we even entered the actual restaurant! 

100/10!!!"}
{"text":"La viande est excellente. Entrecôte choisie avec accompagnement légumes (trop peu à mon goût) et frites (surgelées mais bonnes). Ambiance chaleureuse et carte de vins très fournie et variée. Pour les desserts, le choix reste mince mais correcte pour un restaurant de ce type. Service rapide et accueillant même si nous avons été oublié pour l'apéritif (choisi mais jamais apporté). À refaire pour manger de la bonne viande."}
{"text":"Had early dinner reservations on nye to avoid the crowd. Place was pretty empty and by the time we were done it was about half full. There was a ton of staff, nice decor, and the food is always good. Ribs never disappoint and the ahi tuna is also good. Everything was nice except I feel we were rushed out. As soon as we said no dessert she automatically brought us the bill even though I was planning on getting another drink, so we just left."}
{"text":"First time going to Baton Rouge. My experience was less than stellar. The lights were dim and the fonts on the menu were small


They offered prime rib and underneath the options included Pittsburgh style which I thought why not. Apparently it's not really possible so that means their menu organization isn't well done.  The server wasn't really communicating too well with me so I just gave up and said just give me the medium rare prime rib. They offered to pan sear it but it will make it medium so I declined. 

I ordered it with mixed veggies and house salad. I am hoping it is included with the meal because as I said before the fonts were small and it is dark. 

My wife ordered ribs and chicken. Then the server tried to up sell the soup and salad which apparently was not included in the meal. Sneaky and well worth more than one star deducted just for that. 


The house salad was first to arrive and it wasn't too bad. However, the way it was placed just reminded me of a Chinese restaurant where the plate was just dropped in front if me. Not the type of service level you would expect from a place like this. 

Eventually the prime rib arrived. Bloody thing was tough to cut considering it is medium rare. Not the typical experience I get from Keg. 


The server then asked me how my meal was. I had indicated that the food I got was tough, but the fact that I ate half of it already I told her not to bother changing it.  Normally at keg the manager comes by to try and rectify the situation more which I also usually decline but no such luck here. I doubt the server even told the manager. 

So that was it just got the bill and tipped less than stellar amount because the service and the general food quality of my entree was not up to par. 

Mind you it's just the luck of the draw with the service. Comparing against the tables beside me who got other servers I think we just had one of the bad batch. 

I doubt I will ever come here again."}
{"text":"Great 10$ burger at happy hour and good drink selection.  Sit at the bar and ask for John aka Enrique, best bartender there!"}
{"text":"Il y a tellement mieux aux alentours.... 

40$ pour une assiette hamburger calciné et une bière tiède."}
{"text":"If you like ribs, well this is the right place to be.
I tried plenty of restaurants that are specialized in ribs, and I can say that Baton Rouge is one of the best. The ribs are juice and tender. The bbq sauce is perfect. The sweet potato are delicious. 
The atmosphere is nice, and the place is always crowded during the weekends. In summer, they have this nice terrasse that overlooks on Place des Arts. You can enjoy a nice cold beer !
If you do not find a place at the terrasse, i would suggest the table with couch next to windows.
In general the service is good over there no complaints so far."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Went for dinner one night during JazzFest two weeks ago.  My husband loved the steak with mushroom and blue cheese. I tried it and love it too.  I had the 2 lobster tails with mashed potatoes.  It was so good.  The best was the spinach dip, the drinks, and the service.  Our waiter, Alex was very attentive.  Had a great time.  We will definitely return the Baton Rouge when in Montreal next time. Would definitely recommend ."}
{"text":"I'm over it. I'm sick of people recommending this place just because it's one of the few reasonably priced steakhouses in Montreal that has a variety of foods on their menu. 

The service sucks. The wait sucks. The food is mediocre. The ambiance is lacking. The noise level is aggravating loud. Prices aren't even worth it! 

Extra star for the awesome fries, the only perk to this place."}
{"text":"Just got done being sick for days after eating at Baton Rouge on Fete d'National. You would think on such a day in QC at Place des Arts that they would be serving fresh food. Wrong!

We ordered two racks of ribs. Both were old, burnt and dried out. To hide this they were dripping with sauce. Cole Slaw was sour and rancid, a baked potato was cooked so long it was not edible  and the fries were cold and tasteless. 

When the waiter asked how our meal was I told him that he had served us garbage on a plate. Both were partially eaten and he did wipe the bill. 

Never again shall we eat at Baton Rouge!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant on this place because of the reviews, however I went anyway on the recommendation of a friend. I had the ribs and shrimp which were very good. The shrimp may have been slightly over cooked but not bad enough to raise a fuss over. The ribs were good and the sauce was excellent. They could have been a little bit hotter, but they were still warm so no big deal. The Cesar salad was good and the waitress was very friendly. Overall a good place to eat. I would go back the next time I am in town for sure."}
{"text":"We loved the ribs so much, we went back 2 times during weekend.   Service is quick and we never waited for a table.   There was a $3 tap special during happy hour. $20 for the rib lunch special was very appropriate for the amount of food you get.   Lunch included soup and coffee/tea with meal. No lunch special on weekends."}
{"text":"j'aime bien bâton rouge,  Mais celui ci ne m'a pas super plus.  En partant,  arrive à 17h00 un samedi pour 2 adulte et 2 enfants,  ont à été placé à 18h15!!!  Après avoir vu plusieurs groupe de 4 être placé avant nous,  Je m'informe et on me dit que ce sont des places proche du celier réservé aux adultes. En gros,  les 2 tiers du resto sont réservé  aux adultes,  cela laisse 10 places pour 4 personnes environ avec enfant. vraiment pas correct. 

ensuite la nourriture.  J'ai goûté plusieurs bâton rouge dans plusieurs ville. tous se ressemble,  Sauf celui ci. J'ai pris mes fidèles côté levé  avec frite et fève au four.  les fève étaient presque noir tellement la sauce était sucré,  Rien avoir avec la couleur rougeâtre habituel. le coeur ma presque levé et j'ai du en donner  à mon gars pour finir le petit plat que je mange sans problème normalement. 

les côtés lève étaient brûler,  manquait de viande,  étaient sec et pas du tout tendre.  Rien à voir avec les côté levé  du bâton rouge habituel.  Mon repas un gros 0.

Ma compagne à prit le surligne qui a été parfait selon elle,  Tant mieux. 

le service était bien,  tout était dans un délais très raisonnable et courtois un coup assis."}
{"text":"Bonne côté levé, prix un peu haut dessus de la moyenne mais on pourrait dire que cela va avec la qualité. Malgré que selon la journée où vous y allez, vous pouvez tomber sur un autre chef et elle ne sont pas aussi bonne. Parfois elles sont très grasse sans goût, d'autre fois juste correcte. Il arrive qu'il manque de sauce.

Les fèves poêler sont excellente, Je prend toujours au moins ce choix d'accompagnement.

La tempête au cheddar en entrée est un must si vous aimez ce genre de chose. Elle fond dans la bouche."}
{"text":"Excellent service 
Nourriture très bonne
ambience le fun Avec de la musique à tout le jeudi soir service rapide"}
{"text":"Went there for one birthday, they did not give any birthday special treat but one waiter came to ask for one slice of my birthday cake for his boss..."}
