{"text":"The service was excellent and the food was yummy. I'm excited to come back and try more things."}
{"text":"My new lunch spot. I love the plate here where you can pick all the heathy items you want. It's enough to share with a friend!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Always very clean, and the staff is cheerful and friendly. Food is awesome, can't get enough of the skewers and cilantro sauce. I have also used them for catering many times, and everyone is always impressed with the quality of the food."}
{"text":"First visit to Garbanzo's.  Was not impressed.  Food looked like it was sitting for quite a while.  They try to play it as \"healthy\" but there are so many Med restaurants in the area that just absolutely clean their clock.   The use \"non-hydrogenated\" oil (canola) to deep fry.  But when you look at the ingredients for their salad dressings and sauces, they have \"hydrogenated soybean oil\" in just about everything. Not healthy, not fresh, and not impressed.  Everything looks like it comes right out of a plastic bag from some corporate office.  Definitely not a Chipolte!"}
{"text":"Have been to this place a few times now and enjoy it. It is good..not the best but still good enough to go back whenever we are in the area. I had the falafel plate and lentil soup and enjoyed both. The hummus could be more flavorful but otherwise enjoyed the meal. Nice to have a more diverse option other than burgers or the other greasy fare available in Desert Ridge marketplace"}
{"text":"Just visited this delicious restaurant.  Enjoyed their fresh food selections.  All yummy and healthy choices. No guilt and full tummy!  Great service, great location and great food.  Wish I lived closer I would be a regular."}
{"text":"Extremely convenient, prices are fair, and the quality is as good as most Med restaurants I go to.  The place is very clean and the service is first rate - the manager stopped by to check to make sure we were satisfied.  The entire family liked it, which is pretty rare for my crew.  The best items are the hummus, grilled chicken, and believe it or not, the olives!  It's the best option at Desert Ridge, and well definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Mediterranean cuisine and we love being able to customize what we are eating to fit our preferences. This place does both so well! If you are looking for a quick service experience offering something different than the usual Burgers/Sandwiches, Mexican, or Chinese, then come check them out.  They have a simple menu that offers a plate, a wrap, or a pita to start with, and then you get to add whatever you prefer. It makes it really simple and the employees are very friendly and helpful as many customers are visiting for the first time.  We both got the plate and had our pick of all kinds of specialties. And the plates come with freshly baked pita bread, nice and soft, available in wheat or white too. The chicken is flavorful and the hummus is great. We loved all the vegetable options, and I loved all the sauce choices at the end.   I didn't get to try them, but they have a couple of specialty drinks too, and have a couple desserts as well - baklava anyone? They also do catering (party platters) as well, that might be nice for a party. Tray of hummus and pita? Yes please.  I would definitely compare this to a Chipolte. It is quick and simple and will leave you full. Very glad this chain came to AZ!"}
{"text":"If you're into McDonald's or Burger King, Garbanzo might not be the place for you.  But, if you care about eating healthy, love fresh ingredients and appreciate a friendly staff that has actual knowledge of the food they are serving you, you will LOVE Garbanzo!  The Falafel Pita with Babaganoush, and a Greek Salad are my go-tos. And, they have gluten free items.  Try it. You'll Love It!"}
{"text":"Generously portioned, fresh and tasty! Gyros meat and beef skewers were tender and delicious, sides were all appetizing, and sauces/toppings were the ideal complement. Reasonably priced - even better with a Groupon!  Clean, minimalist ambiance - bare and spare."}
{"text":"Two words: On point! Drove by and noticed a \"Now Open\" sign and thought I'd try it. This is an incredible take on the make your own plate philosophy. The chicken and steak were wonderful, and each side they have is created with fresh ingredients! You have the choice of loading your plate with any sides or toppings you want. It is such a great place to get your veggies in. They also have a portobello option for protein. I hope that Garbanzo takes flight and multiplies throughout the Valley! Not to mention, they also have great service. Someone came by to make sure I had everything I needed. Thanks Garbanzo!"}
{"text":"found this out first week in Phoenix, so glad we did. Now our go-to place for take out dinner or a quick bite. Great choices and the warm pita that comes with the dinner plate tops off the meal. Hard to choose between the falafel and chicken with vegetables, can't go wrong either way."}
{"text":"Garbanzos just opened up in the Desert Ridge shopping center and I can't say enough good things about it. They are welcoming from the minute you walk through the door. If you are a person like me that's new to Mediterranean food they are more then happy to give you a small sample or suggest their favorites. I ordered the falafel plate and decided to get a side of all the sauces... They are great for adding a kick or helping blend together the flavors tahini, tzatziki, mediterranean garlic, red chili, and the cilantro. I highly recommend trying them all and finding your favorite. It's a healthy, fast and flavorful option for lunch or dinner. I will definitely be a returning customer at Garbanzos."}
{"text":"1st visit - really wanted a burger but my fatness reminded me that I needed a healthier option so, this is what I found nearby.   Walked in, place was not too busy at all, clean and welcoming. The menu and directions were easy to follow and no the person who took my order was nice but couldn't answer any of my questions pertaining to the meat being organic, non-GMO or hormone / antibiotic free.  The good news was that co-worker whom I think was a Team lead of some sort, provided me with answers....just regular meat and veggies and nothing fancy. They also serve a gluten free pita for an addition price.  I rdered the grilled chicken salad and was loaded with diced cucumber, diced tomatoes, red onion, regular humus along with feta, tsaziki, kalamata olives and tahini...all in moderation. The salad is mixed in front of you and then placed on a plate with a whole pita on the side as you can see in my pic.   In conclusion: I paid just under $10.50 for my lunch and feel the value for what you pay is acceptible. The portion size was perfect, everything tasted fresh and the pita was warm and not hard or soggy. Also, all the sauces you choose are all made from scratch which is nice even if they are loaded with additives that I cannot spell or pronounce...They also offer a nice section of speciality drinks, sodas etc.  I will be back another time and try something new including their organic tea. I gave the place 4 stars due to none of the ingredients being Non-GMO or Organic with the exception of their tea...overall, the food was great!"}
{"text":"It's the Mediterranean Chipotle. Quick, easy and so delicious. Gluten free and vegan options including sauces, sides and falafel. Love it!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and great service. Came in just after the lunch rush (around 12:45)- no wait. Ordered The Greek salad with gyro. Veggies were fresh and full of flavor. Best of all, freshly brewed green and black tea.   Two of us with drinks was around $22. Noticed they have a deal after 4pm for $25 that serves 4 people. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Not a huge on franchise/chains.  Having said that the food was good.  If you are looking for a quick healthy meal, you can get it here."}
{"text":"The food is authentic and amazingly fresh. The plate looks just like the menu. I was very pleased. I will come back and bring friends and family."}
{"text":"I love the food here and all the people at the Desert Ridge location are always super friendly and helpful.  (I haven't been to the other Phoenix area location yet.) I will always be a regular here."}
{"text":"This place was great. Much like the Chipotle format only Greek. A nice healthy option for those of us who are looking for that."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now.  Over all for a fast food type of place it is good.  However, watch the protein as it has been over cooked on a few occasions."}
{"text":"You go through the line like Chipotle or Subway and pick your ingredients.  Some of the items weren't really fresh.  Falafel was room temperature.  Other items were cold, so basically I had a cold falafel pita sandwich thing.  It shouldn't be a cold sandwich."}
{"text":"My guy ordered a gyro this evening and the meat was cold. He said it was \"okay\" but to serve cold meat is inexcusable to me. I am glad I didn't order anything!  This is the second time I have tried to order something at this place and for some reason was completely perplexed by the simplified menu each time. There's no explanation as to what exactly comes in a plate and the girl I asked really didn't help. Also, reading a menu right to left really threw me for a loop. Maybe I'm just weird and quirky! But I am also used to amazing Mediterranean mom-and-pop type places on the east coast. This is just too corporate and Chipotle-style (gross) for my taste."}
{"text":"This food was disgusting and overcooked. I feel genuinely sorry for anyone that believes this is Greek food. The falafels were hard, greasy and nasty. The sauces were full of sugar, the calories for eating greasy, flavorless steak was totally not worth it. If you need fast greek food, I would urge you to look elsewhere. How does this place have 3 stars still?"}
{"text":"Generic tasting food. The gyro meat was dry and crispy, hummus had a bitter taste and was not good, the tzatziki had a very strong cumin taste to it that we did not enjoy. Even though the service was great and everyone was nice definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place almost has it right. The chicken kabob flavor is decent. The cucumber and tomato salad is fresh and tastes pretty good.   However, the rice seemed to have been sitting for a while and had a lot of hard bits. The pita was cold as well. It might have been warm when it came out of the oven, but it was hard and cold when I bit into it.  The hummus is runny and has an overpowering sour flavor. It needs to be a little thicker (add less water folks) and use more beans to offset the seasonings.  Overall it's a warm meal and it's fast, but given so many choices in the area, I'll probably go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Great Food and friendly staff - this food is full of flavor and is actually HEALTHY!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Mediterranean food is a nice healthy meal. The pricing won't break the bank, and the staff are friendly. Food is flavorful but won't leave you feeling like you ate a bag of salt like some quick or fast food restaurants.  Ordering is similar to Chipotle style - pick your style of dish, protein and then build it yourself.  Definitely worth a visit if you want to try out Mediterranean, and if you like it, return for more like I have.   Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I had this catered today at work and it was so delicious!! The tabuleh was to die for the chicken was seasoned well. I didn't care for the hummus but I loved everything else I tried. Will definitely be visiting the restaurant in person"}
{"text":"I order a carry out on June 15th.young man by name of Dallas was excellent and extremely professional on the phone. When I went into the restaurant I was greeted warmly by Katherine.  Collective they both were efficient and courteous.  That's who I would want working for me if I owned a restaurant. To top that off order was correct and delicious.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to my friends and family. Thank you for a great experience.  I would give the resturant 5 stars. Barry dorman"}
{"text":"Nice, simple menu for a variety of taste buds. Nice options for people who need gluten and dairy free, as well. Friendly fast service. Nice addition to Desert Ridge. My kids love this place and I do, too. I would like to see a few more menu options, Like grilled veggies, but overall this place is great!"}
{"text":"I had gone to the desert ridge location a couple years ago and thought it was ok but nothing special and never returned. Today I was wanting a healthy\"ish\" lunch and happened to be in the same parking lot as this Garbanzo so decided to give it a shot. So glad I did! The menu has been completely revamped since I was there and was now \"chipotle style\" where you go down the line and they customize what you want. I ordered the flatbread (could also order as a salad, plate, or pita if you choose) and topped it with grilled chicken, hummus, tomato/cucumber mix, feta, red onion, kalamata olives, lettuce, tzatziki sauce, chili sauce and a tad of greek dressing. Was absolutely delicious and loved that it was one price no matter how much I asked them to pile on (no extra charges for feta, olives, extra sauces, etc). Also ordered a side of their chips with additional sides of sauces just so I could taste them all. The people working were really helpful and friendly. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The selection of food is pretty small.  I ordered a steak plate with a couple of sides.  The steak was very chewy and I didn't like  the spices.  I ordered the rice but didn't take a bite because it looks like it was sitting in the bin all day.  The baba ganoush was ok but the humus tasted spoiled.  I had one bite and threw the rest of it away.  The pita bread was just ok.  I came home and had to make some more food because I threw most of my food out.  My wife had the lemon rice soup because it was recommended by the employee.  They served it from a container and you can tell its been sitting there forever because it was all crusty on the sides.  She took one bit of it and threw it away.  She had a falafel pita and said it was ok.  The place is nice and clean and I like the décor.    I will not be back. I don't like to see business go under but if they don't change and serve better/fresher food, they won't be around much longer."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! They closed them all in Maryland so when we moved to AZ I was so excited to come here again! Great staff at this location as well!!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible Gyros. The meat is overcooked and bland, the hummus is bland, all of their sauces taste like sugar. The rice is coated in a thick sludge of grease, the steak is no better. My wife and I paid $17 for two entrées, ate three bites and threw it away. I don't EVER throw food away. If I paid money for it, I am going to eat it. But I threw this away. That's how bad it was. This food is a waste of time effort and money and calories. Avoid it."}
{"text":"They claim the \"meat\" is cut off and reheated....it's not.  Staff is really nice-food is really bad."}
{"text":"Like chipotle- but Mediterranean food!!  The hubby and I came in on a Tuesday night. I got the chicken plate which basically includes everything on the bar from salad to Taboulieh, hummus, olives, pita, so yummy! The flavors of everything were great and I loved the cilantro sauce and tzatziki sauce.  The hunny got the chicken pita and really liked the flavor of the red chili sauce.  The employees were very nice- as we were eating they checked on us and asked if we liked our food."}
{"text":"Went to the Desert Ridge location.They have the frozen slices of gyros that they throw on the grill, not the 'real' gyros on a spit. Why bother? So I had the steak gyros... bad decision. Very tough, barely edible. Wife had the chicken gyros, said it was pretty bad, tasted frozen. My first and last time eating here."}
{"text":"Always a great choice! Everything I've tried is delicious! Lots of healthful , satisfying options!!  Friendly staff, you go through a line and can make your order exactly as you want.  One of my favorite lunch spots!"}
{"text":"We love Garbanzo! We got hooked on it while living in Denver and we're stoked it finally came to AZ! Opening night didn't disappoint - hummus, vegetable salad, tabouleh, chicken, falafel, pita. Everything was delicious and brought back great Colorado memories. Check it out! You will love it!"}
{"text":"My salad was really good. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff and clean dinning area .  I will be back."}
{"text":"Lemongrass ginger green tea is fabulous!  I got a plate with a little bit of everything!  The vegetable salad and hummus were particularly delicious. Very friendly service from Jon! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I asked for a laffa and got a totilla wrap, staff are clueless, pita bread was not soft and just crumbled. My son ordered a pita pocket, with just salad and hummus, $8.00.  Not worth the money. Dont see this place lasting very long. Will not go back. Falafel is from frozen. I lived in Israel for many years, and this is an embarrasment to Israeli food. I am so disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for a quick bite at Dessert Ridge. I had a steak kabob and a chicken kabob. The meat and veggies were fresh and nicely grilled. I thought the kabobs as well as the hummus lacked seasoning. I did add the garlic sauce, which added flavor. Loved the vegetable salad and the mint lemonade! The staff was extremely nice! Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Gyro here was bad.  First, it cost 9 dollars for just one Gyro and nothing else.  What!?.  The hummus is ok but the pita bread tasted old and the meat was cold!  They don't shave it when you order.  It sits in a buffet like set up and served cold.  Disappointing meal high priced."}
{"text":"Food = very good. Service = very nice. Definitely will be back.  My suggestion/complaint is that the website and the Yelp profile says \"Delivery: Yes.\" No, that's not correct. They only deliver for orders of $100 or more."}
{"text":"This is such a great Mediterranean restaurant. They have so many great options for you to choose from. There tzatziki sauce and hummus is amazing! I ordered a salad and it comes with the option of a pita on the side and when I got to the end of the line they come out of the back with these fresh hot warm toasty pita bread's that were absolutely delicious. The smell alone was amazing. The staff at this location is incredible! You feel very comfortable and well taken care of. I will definitely go there again without a doubt"}
{"text":"I love the idea. Yes I've had better but the staff was super friendly.  Not annoying friendly, actual friendly.  I liked the rice, hummus, and sauces. Chicken was ok. I might try something else but I will come back."}
{"text":"Well, the employees were friendly. The Chicken salad was not tasty and the chicken has no flavor, they need to be not so stingy with the feta cheese. The dressing was really good, though. The Chicken Pita was terrible. No flavor in the chicken. It just falls flat. The cucumber mix is disappointing. It's just not good. The tizitisi is basic good, but not much flavor to it."}
{"text":"Rice was so dry and crunchy, it ruined the wrap. I came back a few days later and mentioned the rice issue. She game me a sample and BAM, dry and crunchy yet again. The need to stir it occassionally and/or keep covered. The Falafle was also dry and seemed over cooked.  I declined the rice and the wrap was fresh and tasty.   I'm just not sure with the limited menu how long this place can be relevant."}
{"text":"It's a fine place but both times I have been there I have been underwhelmed by the quality and flavor. I go a pita the first time and they did not mix the ingredients but piled them on so that I would have one bite of all meat, then one of all veggies, and ended with a mound of hummus at the bottom."}
{"text":"This place is basically a Greek Chipotle. It's new. It's clean. It's fast. It's reasonably priced. It's fresh. The food is....okay. If you want a quick lunch and prefer something better than a fast food yuck burger then this place is a great option. If your wanting flavorful, authentic Mediterranean food this isn't it."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Too bad there are not other locations here. We happened to be in PV for an errand and desperately looking for a take-out salad. This was the closest place. Truly the salad was fresh and quite tasty. The meat was crispy on the sides, which initially it was weird to have gyro meat with crispy sides, but now I cannot stop thinking about this salad and we topped it off with the tomato cucumber salad. Truly yummy!"}
{"text":"Came here with family last night, thought we'd give it a try. They are like a Chipotle and Pita Jungle intermix wanna be, of course the quality of food is not even near! The wrap was ok, chicken was very dry. My daughter had the pita and they told her it was the last one...(who only carries a minimum supply when you open?) My husbands order was messed up so they gave it to him for free (which was nice, but I didn't mind paying). I think when you open a brand new spot, you should meet all the expectations, and their food wasn't that great... the people working there were very nice!"}
{"text":"Do NOT visit this restaurant.  There is a reason why there are not a lot of people in this place, which made my alarms go off but I went there anyway.  I was going to go to Habit Burger next door but they were overcrowded and I was super hungry so I went to Garbanzo.  BIG MISTAKE!  The falafel balls were overcooked, burnt, and disgusting. They were really dry and inedible.  It is obvious that the oil in the fryer was way over needing changed.  The pita was also not fresh; it was hard and dry, too.  They mixed all of the items together in the flimsy container.  As far as the employee who waited on me, she didn't use the utensils she was supposed to use.  I thought it was odd that she used her hands to give me lettuce,  although she had on latex gloves (yes, there were utensils there at her disposal...readily available).  In hindsight, I really should have gone to Habit Burger next door.  There is a reason they are more crowded than Garbanzos...where I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. Brought my friends to try it. I got gyro with salad and it was as before delicious!! My friends also liked it  very much!. The place is clean and the employees very nice and presen6. I will be back again. Also got my free chocolate cookie."}
{"text":"With today's food brands locked in (I.e. Starbucks, Chipotle, McDonald's) starting up a new restaurant can be tricky. I'm not sure why I waited so long to try this place, but I'm hooked!! It's EXACTLY like Chipotle but for Mediterranean food! Fresh ingredients, flavorful and surprisingly authentic! The rice tastes exactly like my mom makes! I was overjoyed, surprised, and I may just pick up a second job just to eat here everyday forever!"}
{"text":"Use to go off cave creek  now off 51st and cactus now I know why the other 1 closed won't be back ..food not fresh .chicken like a rock .humus oh pushed it off to the side it was bitter killed my meal won't be back"}
{"text":"I'm torn on my review for this place. I thought for certain after my experience last week, I would probably never return, but there are few fast casual restaurants that are somewhat healthy and offer gluten-free options.  My kids and I came in a little after 6pm and although there was a little bit of a line, it wasn't busy. There were four employees working behind the counter and everything looked clean and organized.   The menu has a lot of options - choose your protein (chicken, steak, falafel, kabob, gyro), choose the way you want it (pita, plate, flatbread, salad), choose your fixing (so many to list), choose a side if you like, and a drink. Kids meals have a couple different entree options (chicken or steak with rice, stuffed pita, grilled cheese pita) and come with your choice of side and a drink.  I start by ordering my kid's meals, both wanted a grilled cheese pita but one of my children is gluten-free. When I asked for it on the gluten-free pita, the girl behind the counter (Sadie? I don't remember the name on the name tag but it was something close to that) told me she couldn't do it. I asked why not (which seemed to catch her off guard) and was it because of their grill (because they put wheat pitas on it to make grilled cheese) and she said no, and said \"It's because the pita comes like this\" and holds up a foil-wrapped pita. I still don't understand. Anyway...I'm not going to argue and I don't want to hold up the line. My daughter is upset because she really wanted grilled cheese but decided to go with the steak and rice. I order my food and proceed down the line.  I get to the register to pay and ask for a GF pita on the side. I pay, take my food and sit down. Taylor brings the pita out after they have warmed it up. My daughter opens it up and low and behold, there is a soft pita inside that closely resembles the one that my wheat eating child is eating her grilled cheese on. Unless the sandwiches are pre-made off site, there is no way you can tell me that they couldn't have slapped some cheese on it and threw it on a grill.   Overall, the food was pretty good and I liked their options, but I'm not so happy with the service. However, it's not the fault of the high school girl behind the counter just trying to make a couple bucks, it comes down to management. So here's my note to them: Please train your employees to not say \"we can't do that\" - teach them that yes, they can make exceptions and there is always a way to ensure a customer can have simple requests fulfilled - especially if they are willing to pay for them."}
{"text":"If you are searching for Mediterranean food, steer clear.  The Humus was horrible.  The Gyros were dry and tasteless.  This can not be cut off a spit. If it is they are doing it wrong.  Was disappointed in this place. It had the potential to be great!! but fell WAY short of the goal.  Not returning."}
{"text":"Sadly, these folks wouldn't know a Gyro from ... anything else. The delicious, hot, roasted-on-a-spit gyro meat we all know and love is nowhere to be found here. Instead, they serve some warmed over processed garbage from a box. Why bother when there are so many other tasty Gyros in town?   At least the place is clean. It was certainly uncontaminated by customers when we were there."}
{"text":"$25 for 2 plates + drinks.  Steak is tough and cold.  Hummus is uninspired. Gyros is held in a buffet line instead of carved as ordered.  Short of the steak. Promised to bring more. Never did.  No customers.  3 kids screwing around behind counter. Trash can full.  Dirty plates stacked up.   We won't be back any time soon. Suggest you pass it up"}
{"text":"We happen to come upon this yesterday and me and my boyfriend have been trying to be adventurous and try new things.  so we walked it and immediately by the amazingly friendly staff!  Oh and............... This has got to be the best place i have ever had a salad! Everything was great!!  The staff was super nice and helpful.  They give free samples of anything you want to try and there falafel is the best I have had in awhile! I cant wait for one to open in Tucson!!  I will go there all the time!"}
{"text":"I didn't mind the taste of the food and it was super quick,  but when I found a cockroach in my meal,  it was game over.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Best falafel and hummus in Phoenix. Fast clean and yummy. Definitely a repeat offender. Cactus location seems a little better run than Desert Ridge but both are delicious.  It's definitely a great choice for vegetarian like me."}
{"text":"Not a place I will be spending any time or money. They are supposed to offer you a sample of falafel upon entrance, but nobody ever did. I asked myself and was given an overcooked, burnt falafel ball. It was horribly dry and decrepit and not fit for human consumption. Was then thinking about getting a chicken wrap, but no white meat available. So you have a white meat kabob, but not white meat anything else? Strange, but props to employee who corrected another employee on the white meat situation. After that, no reasons left to stay, so out the door."}
{"text":"Their portions are great, especially if you get double protein, and the food is fairly healthy. Took one star off because the rice and some other stuff could be healthier, but that being said, I've come here multiple times per week for lunch. I drive 15 min just to get here! Wish there was one up in Glendale."}
{"text":"Really good and cheap place to eat. The staff was super cool and the service was quick. I really like Mediterranean food and they deliver a great assortment of delicious options. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This was a unique concept for me, I had never eaten at a Mediterranean fast food restaurant.  Customer service was great, they answered my questions and I was able to select a beef skewer bowl with a variety of unusual ingredients which turned out to be very tasty and freshly prepared right in front of my eyes.   They even put a little sample of the spicy pork on the bowl for me to try since I couldn't decide which I would prefer.   Most of everything in the bowl was food I had never tried before.  It was tasty and well prepared but I don't think it will ever be my first choice as ethnic food goes."}
{"text":"Food wasn't that good. gyro had meat that was flat and lacked flavor.  seemed over priced too."}
{"text":"I would like to give more stars as the food is excellent....service sucked mid afternoon I guess that's the time for staff to catch up with their friends and each other on social subjects . Green tea was empty when I ordered I pointed this out to one of the four staff that was standing around ... got my food ate and  leaving and tea was still empty I pointed this out but I guess he was too busy chatting with his friend ."}
{"text":"This place is kind of like the subway of pita wraps. Very polite and pleasant service at this location. As I don't normally make my own Greek pittas it was nice to have all the ingredients there for me to see and learn by name. I added some ingredients I don't normally see in wraps I order and was pleasantly surprised.  Will definitely return again."}
{"text":"This is not the place to go for Mediterranean food..The gyros were awful. The hummus was so disgusting. The person in front of me ordered one of their chicken plates... They put the chicken on the grill for less then two mins.. Which means it had to be precooked.. And they pull out a cold pita out of a container bin. I can say I am not impressed with the quality it can't even be compared to a chipotle.. It's that awful..."}
{"text":"Fresh, fresh, fresh!  Excellent made from scratch items.  We split a gyros burrito.  Got to pick all ingredients, as they prepared it our way, including hummus, cucumber yogurt sauce, and babaganoush, the choices were incredible.  They even offered to put these items on the side!  We split the burrito and got a bag of homemade chips for the dips.  The flavors were off the charts imo.  Fresh, quality, goodness in every way.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I was looking for a fresh lunch after my chiropractor appointment and I found it at Garbanzo!  I absolutely loved my gyro with all the fixings and friendly service. This is a lunch that fills me up and I can feel good about. I just wish there was a location closer to central Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I swung into Garbanzos last week early afternoon and was extremely impressed by the friendliness of all the employees. As soon as I walked in, they offered me a couple different tastes to help me decide what to order as this was my first time there. I ordered a chicken/rice/hummus plate for my son and the gyro for me. Extremely fresh and flavorful! Had a great lunch and so much better than your typical fast food."}
{"text":"The food is garbage - fast food Mediterranean at best.   This place thinks its the Mediterranean Chipotle but doesn't come close to executing and the food quality isn't good at all.  The food quality is poor on both quality and taste. If you're expecting all white meat chicken, you'' be disappointed. And fresh pitas? Nope, pulled straight out of a packaged bag right in front of you.  There are definitely better alternatives available and there is no way I'll be going back to this place.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The workers seem ill-prepared, disorganized, and clueless. They kept switching plates, put on wrong toppings. Everybody behind of me got their orders before mine. They dropped the thermometer on the floor, walked over it, and only rinsed it off in a bucket after noticing it.  The food was good though, and they did apologize in addition to giving us a free meal."}
{"text":"DO NOT order take-out from this location. They WILL screw it up, guaranteed. I've attempted take-out twice and both orders have been a disaster. The second time I had to make a second trip from my house to pick up the salad dressing they forgot. The most pathetic part is they didn't even attempt to make it up to me with a coupon, etc. I can only assume the utter lethargy with the staff is a reflection of the poor leadership at the management/corporate level."}
{"text":"This a good healthy alternative to your normal fast food place. As this was my first time here the employees were very helpful. Not a big gyro person but I really enjoyed the gyro wrap that I ordered. I know this will not be my last time here. Thank you."}
{"text":"Good service for being in a crowded shopping complex. This place is a Chipotle-esque Greek food establishment! Choose bowl or pita, your protein, and then the veggies!  Excellent if you're shopping at the mall and don't want a sit-down restaurant dining experience."}
{"text":"Found this place for a girls lunch.  It was perfect as all five of us have different dietary requirements.  We all liked it except the plastic forks.  I had the chicken salad.  Everything in it tasted fresh.  They gave me a little of each type of sauce so I could determine which I liked best. My four friends ordered plates and wished they would have ordered the salad as they did not eat the pita.  All and all a good lunch for the price."}
{"text":"Great place for an informal quick lunch or dinner. I had the falaffel pita and was immensely satisfied. The food is awesome and the staff are very friendly and accommodating. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Fabulous find.   We were leaving Macy's and I asked \"where do you want to go for lunch?\"  We remembered there was a Habit Burger across the street, so off we went.  So here we are walking past Garbanzo. It was very dark inside with their tinted windows and the signs on the window said \"Space Available.\" So I thought \"Wow\" that was fast, didn't they just open?  Well, another Phoenix business has closed.   We get to Habit and the line is out onto the sidewalk. D'oh!  But just then, someone leaves Garbanzo and the lights inside tell a different story. Yes, they're open.  It turns out the sign \"Space Available\", was for another store.  So the heck with burgers, let's eat Greek/Middle Eastern.  Sorry Habit!  Garbanzo Mediterranean Grill is like the Chipotle's for the Gryos and hummus crowd. It's actually more of a fast food version of Pita Jungle. The food is really good and fresh!  Lunch ran us under $20  and we left very impressed.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Four stars for the falafel alone.  My partner got extra and I ate them later on that night for a snack.  Everything else was great--a nice play on the Chipotle business model.  But, oh, falafel...."}
{"text":"Really great 'fast' food - healthy and quick but everything was just SO flavorful! I got a veggie wrap and the flavors of everything worked so well - hummus, pickles, cabbage, rice, lettuce - the tahini dressing was amazing and the Greek vinaigrette finished it off nicely! I almost went back for another one! My husband got the steak wrap with hummus, lettuce, tabbouleh, tzatziki, and rice and he said he was really good as well. We also got the season chips which were great as well.   This place is basically a Mediterranean Chipotle"}
{"text":"I know when younger looking people go in places, people don't really bother to work there best considering they're there peers but my visit was one of the worst visits I've had at your store... Pretty upsetting on how terrible the customer service was when I only ordered 1 thing but 4 other people r allowed to pass me in line. Completely unacceptable, wasn't even offered a beverage an didn't get to complete my Oder how I wanted it. That'll be the last visit there for me, an I'll be encouraging others to do the same. I'd highly consider a talk with your employes on professionalism an just flat out courtesy to your guests."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars!  Their falafel is very good.  It was pretty fast and the employees were great.  I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks back and I was not impressed at all! This joint is like a knock off of Greek restaurants.   The food was simple and with no flavor.   The staff was decent."}
{"text":"I went their last night for dinner after reading the review here on Yelp.  They mailed a \"buy on; get one free\" coupon to my house which how I learned about them.  I was really looking forward to it because there aren't any Gyro places in my area.  My friend is from Turkey and loves Gyro.  They offered us a free Falafel tasting while we were standing in line to order.  I'd read an unfavorable rating about their Falafel so was looking forward to trying it for myself.  We both agreed it was dry, overcooked and tasteless; actually terrible.  With that we decided we'd both order a standard Gyro sandwich.  It was the worst Gyro either of us ever had.  They have a nice concept of healthy ingredients but unfortunately they don't have their recipe right.  It was tasteless and for us worse, a bad taste.  We frequent Mediterranean, Middle East and Israeli restaurants frequently and have both traveled the world extensively.  We understand they make their own pita, it was OK but not pita as we know it.  We didn't like the sauce.  Their gyro at least wasn't the standard prepackage frozen gyro we've received at many places here in the valley.    It was our last time their.  With this introduction, we wouldn't even risk a second visit.  BTW, there staff and service were wonderful.  However when my friend began asking question it was obvious they didn't have any knowledge about \"true\" Mediterranean food.  This is more of a fast food American version of a tasteless \"American\" version.  I was disappointed because it's conveniently located near my house.  We came home and made Turkish coffee just to get the bad taste out of our mouths."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's always quiet and clean. Food is To-Die-For. Yum Yum!   I did have a bad experience there a couple weeks ago where my fiancé and I ate something bad and the food caused us to be quite nauseous for a few hours... But I'd been there at least a dozen times before then and everything was wonderful.   You should come here if you're in the mood for Mediterranean food (hummus, pita, tzatziki, gyros, etc)."}
{"text":"You had me when I was offered to try a falafel when I walked in.  So you may know I am a falfel junkie, and this place is not helping. They have falfel, and other items like chicken and beef but veg me just gets the flafel.  The next choice is the format, Plate, Pita or wrap. The plate is by far the best value and great if you have a problem deciding.   You get to pick what \"salads\" you  want Hummus, babaganush, cucumber tomato, cabbage and more, just get them all. Then sauces Tahnini spicy scug get them on the side. and don't forget that comes with a pita.  One key is to get the falafel fresh, you want it stright from the fryer and not sitting in the line for 20-30 min as it looses the crunch."}
{"text":"Awesome! Friendly service and pretty good priced! (Tip: Get on Groupon). I like that they have so many options for Vegetarian, Gluten Free and dairy free. Very tasty and lots of variety. The gluten free Pita is the best one I had so far.  I wish there is any way they can change the Gyro meat to make it gluten free as well, it's the only protein that isn't."}
{"text":"I find myself in here every other weekend.  They do a great job with the falafel, salads and chicken and lamb.  The food is fresh and quickly served.  Do not miss the mint lemonade, a real find."}
{"text":"Really great. Food was fresh and tasty. It took a bit longer to make than at chipotle even though it wasn't busy but similarly priced to chipotle and very good. I will go back."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to Garbanzo's and since the first two visits were satisfactory, I don't feel I can be as critical of this restaurant as I want to be.  I do have several reasons for the low rating and they are: 1) The steak that I saw them putting on my salad was some sorry looking steak. It was dried up and looked pretty old. I asked for fresher meat and while I did receive some pieces of fresher meat, they still left the older portion that they served on my salad. 2) The ratio of steak to the size of the salad was too small.  They seriously need to look at increasing the amount of meat that they allot for the price of the meal.  My husband had the chicken kabob platter and he said the same thing -- not enough meat. We left feeling hungry. 3) The temperature of the steak was cold.   4) The quality of the steak in my opinion was cheap.  It was very fatty and there were several pieces that I just couldn't eat because of being too hard to chew.  Since they are claiming to be a healthy type of restaurant, I expect leaner meats.  Yes this is a quite lengthy review, but it's because I feel this restaurant has potential, but only if the owners listen to the customers."}
{"text":"Oh YUM! I was like a kid in a candy shop here. I wish there were more Garbanzos on my side of town. I got the plate with Falafel, it had a had a little bit of everything. The plates are so filling, but it's hard not to eat it all because it's so darn good! The store was very clean, and cold lol! Next time I'll bring a jacket. I mainly wrote this review because of the young ladies working there. They were all so sweet! Quite the dedicated bunch, especially given their age. As a manager myself, I'd love to have a team like! Check this place out for a healthy (still high in calories, but heart healthy) meal. Check in on Yelp to get the dessert too..."}
{"text":"So if you want a Chipotle style Mediterranean fast food place, then check this place out.  It was pretty tasty and not bad if looking for a quick lunch.  It did not knock my socks off, but is a nice change from Chipotle.  Not going to win any awards, but you will probably be satisfied.  Checked in on Yelp and was supposed to get a free cookie...they did not have any, so it did not happen...bummer."}
{"text":"We really loved this place. My 3 yo son cried when we got there this afternoon to find it closed. Your food was fabulous & a great healthy option for our family."}
{"text":"I cannot begin to express enough my love for this restaurant.  I've always been a fan of a good gyro and absolutely love falafel. I've been going to this restaurant now for a couple of months and regularly think about going back.  The food is fresh and plentiful, yet affordable.  The best part? Their sauces are all labelled as to whether they have gluten, dairy, etc.  Amazing! I can be sure that I am eating all of the delicious food I want (think Chipotle but with greek food) and also can be sure not to consume any dairy. As an added bonus they have baklava and cookies which my daughter just loves as well as fresh brewed flavored teas and lemonade. I will be returning as often as possible."}
{"text":"Either something is wrong with me or Garbanzo has the best stuffed grape leaves ever... I love them  Awesome customer service. You can tell great customer service is a pillar in their business model.   I loved the chicken lemon soup too."}
{"text":"Went to Garbanzo for lunch today and had the chance to taste almost everything! We were the first 'customers' of the day, the food was free while their staff is still in training, with an optional donation to Mollen Foundation. My favorites? Baba ganoush, potato chips, cucumber salad and the flavored teas (pomegranate/cranberry and ginger/lemon). Give it a try, they officially open 11/24. Interesting concept and great service.  **Falafels were great too, and dolmeh (stuffed grape leaves)... I do not know how to describe the difference, but I think the dolmeh was the best I have ever had. It was tasty, and it could be it had more olive oil, the texture was different and it was yummy. **I keep coming back to edit this review : ) They also had a cilantro sauce, along with tzatziki (lots of dill in the tzatziki), a mediterranean sauce with a ranch base (I believe), a tahini sauce and some other hot sauce I think. **For vegetarian option for the plates they have portobella mushrooms, (beside falafel, and dolmeh I guess) I tasted them as well and they were great. **For pita, they are made in house and they have regular and wheat. They are so fluffy, I think they are all pita pockets. Really good! We also had baklava."}
{"text":"Surprisingly amazing. Love all the healthy food options. The staff were amazing and friendly like no other. This type of customer service is unprecedented and rare these days."}
{"text":"I have had lunch here twice, but our office has had their catering option a few times. Lunch was spot on and very good. Portion sizes are great and you can tell they make the food fresh. The catering is the best deal, for sure, though. We ordered for about 15 people, but there was a nice amount of left overs I had the next day, too. The catering presentation is great and they come and set-up and label everything.  I would recommend them for lunch and highly recommend the catering options. It's a nice break from all the other fast casual places out there.   Oh, and the cookies are awesome, too! Fresh, hot out of the oven when I got them."}
{"text":"Have you been to the Mediterranean before?  Many recall the delicious food they can savor when traveling there.  Now...you don't have to go far to enjoy some genuine Mediterranean food at a great price.  Garbanzo is a restaurant that I've frequented on several occasions.    You walk in and choose your type of dish:  pita, salad, plate, burrito, or flatbread.  You then select a protein:  grilled chicken, grilled steak, gyro meat, falafel, portobello, chicken kabob, or steak kabob.  You can then add veggies from various hummus options, baba ganoush, tomato cucumber salad, tabbouleh salad, or other options.  Then, select sauces from tzatziki, feta cheese, tahini sauce, or others.  Finally, pick sides you may want to add from pita, homemade fries, chips, falafel, baklava, cookies, or applies.  You can't go wrong!  I love their grilled chicken, which I have had in all five dishes.  Other than the variations (which there are many!!), the only other items are the drinks.  Simple yet very creative.    You can order online and then pick-up in the store.   You can also cater.  Regardless, you are eating healthy and delicious food when you go to Garbanzo.  Don't forget to sign up the V.I.B. (Very Important Bean) Rewards Club.  I believe I received a $5 credit on this free club card when I first signed up.  Almost enough for a dish.  Of course, there are birthday freebies and other credits once you earn so many points.    Check in on Yelp for a free chocolate chip cookie!  Also, you can get a buy one, get one free for an entree through the Entertainment Book."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is amazing and the staff is so friendly that I love going here to eat. My friend and I went here for lunch. We eat completely different diets, but were both able to have a delicious, healthy and inexpensive lunch.  I chose the plate lunch with grilled portobello mushrooms. Excellent! I thought the falafal with the cilantro sauce was delicious!  I didn't have the pita so I can't comment on it.  The staff was friendly, smiling the whole time and patient while I perused the variety of options. Close to work, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great gluten free options! The gyro meat is NOT gf though. They have gf pita bread and the other protein options are gf. Very clean and the staff helped us out greatly. This is not traditional Mediterranean but is great for quick healthy on the go food."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new. Came in and I was greeting right away and all of my questions were answered and I had a terrific meal! I got the plate with the falafel. So good! I got alittle of everything to try it out.   The customer service was outstanding and everyone was smiling and happy, and the food was terrific. The establishment was very clean, even the restrooms.   Stephanie was just great and was really helpful. She gave me some of the best customer service I have had in a long time and she was very knowledgable."}
{"text":"Tonight Garbanzo Mediterranean Grill was on point, the counter person offered me a free falafel and it was on from there. I asked about the portobello mushrooms and he told me that they could do a half portobello and falafel option. That's all I needed to hear I immediately said make me a platter with Falafel & Portobello Mushrooms, hummus, baba ganoush, seasoned rice, tabouli, Greek salad, red cabbage, pickles and olives. Pretty awesome meal and with tax it was only $7.57. To keep it vegan ask for the pita they use for the gyros or skip the pita. They whole dish was packed with flavor hence the extra star this time. This place is close to home and I am kicking myself for not coming here more often. Next time I will add some roasted eggplant soup and try their house made chips."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Desert Ridge location and were less than impressed, food tastes processed, etc.  we decided to give this location a shot.  Night and day difference!  Food was fresh, reasonably priced and portions were very generous. I got the steak plate with baba ganoush, cabbage, mushrooms, cucumber and tomatoes and taziki sauce.  My husband ordered the Gyros, and although he liked it wished they would have told him they put rice, etc in it (he will remember this next time he orders to ask for the rice, humus, etc. on the side.). My daughter loved the kids gyros.  We will definitely be coming back, healthy food reasonably priced.  I also love that they serve organic milk with the kids meal."}
{"text":"Whenever I see \"cobb\" on the menu, it's almost as if my eyes zoom straight in and my sights are set and locked.  I don't know what it is about this salad that just makes my mouth start to water.  It doesn't matter what version it is-- or how each restaurant will tweak the recipe just a little to make it their own.  Cobb has found a permanent place in my heart and my belly is always happier as a result.  I'm sure you guys know by now that I ordered the Mediterranean Cobb Salad here and all I can remember thinking was how good it was.    The grilled chicken, fresh greens, sliced hard boiled egg, dressing and extra pita bread on the side made for a party in my mouth and I cannot tell you how pleased I was that I ordered this.    The Mango Hibiscus tea was just as satisfying-- sweet, refreshing and thirst quenching.   To top it off, the facilities were clean, and the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Food is still good but the location by paradise valley mall gives way bigger portions. Almost twice the amount of food for the same price. Kind of a let down here"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients but my gyro was slathered in tzatziki sauce and devoid of any real flavor.  The falafel was kind of the same.  I'm not a big fan of the dumb down the spices for the American folk cuisine."}
{"text":"Garbanzo is a tasty, fresh Mediterranean place that has a variety of items for your wrap, pits or bowl. The prices are reasonable at $8-$10 for a big entree.  It seems that I am timid around Mediterranean food and I just got a chicken pita with lettuce, onions and garlic sauce.  I also got fresh potato chips. I saved the pits for the next day in the fridge and it was great. The chicken had a good grill taste.  The chips were tasty too.   I probably wouldn't come back here by myself as I don't care for a lot of the toppings, but they look great and the girlfriend enjoyed her loaded up pita."}
{"text":"Great healthy, fresh food. Friendly staff. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"There are so few \"cool\" chains, particularly in my area, and so I was very bummed about its closure, though not really a surprise.  They never seemed all that busy--never a good sign for a restaurant in a high rent strip mall.  Food was always fresh and reliable, and I never had a problem with the service.  I will miss the opportunity to get a complete, healthy, balanced meal for around $10 and the ability to sample their falafel for the price of \"Please\"!"}
{"text":"There's lots of options, so it makes for great combinations for something new every time. The food is fresh and delicious, and the service is quick and friendly. If you are looking for something new, quick, and inexpensive this is the place to go."}
{"text":"For what it is, a Mediterranean Chipotle, it's pretty good. A quick easy alternative for a different dish. Get the plate your first time there and sample everything. I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Worst Mediterranean food ever had. Ordered one chicken plate and one chicken kabob plate, kabob had a some onions and bell peppers but 3 small cubes of chicken, the portions were too small and tasteless. The staffs were so careless that we had to go to them asking for our pita after completing more than half of the meal. Have no clue why these many reviews for this place. Anyways not gonna spent a single penny here anymore."}
{"text":"Nice ambience and good food.. Courteous staff.. Falafel is very tasty.. Prices are reasonable and a must try for Mediterranean food lovers"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's perfect for eating healthy on the go. Food is always fresh, everyone working here is super nice. I wish there were more Garbanzos in the Phoenix area! Would make my life a lot easier lol..."}
{"text":"I liked the concept, but it just fell flat for me. The food wasn't very flavorful, the falafel was overdone and the chicken was not breast meat.   The staff was really nice, but I don't think i would go back."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, nice and quick.  Excellent food, nice staff.  I've been here quite a few times, it's my go-to place if I'm looking for something quick but healthy.  I get the mushrooms for the protein and veggies with rice and ask their recommendation on sauces.  Always great picks."}
{"text":"Love your restaurant but please get rid of the cheap sriracha sauce from china. I won't eat anything from china. Use the real red rooster sriracha sauce please. Anything else is cheap looking and it doesn't match your restaurant."}
{"text":"Good, affordable, healthy, fast without being \"fast food\" - love their gyro and their pita sandwiches. And their homemade mint lemonade is to die for. I'm becoming a regular while running errands in the Cactus & Tatum area."}
{"text":"I thought I would try this place as a vegetarian option. First thing through the door I was welcomed and offered a Falafel. Not bad, I decided on a Falafel plate. A little bit of all the options, hummus, babaganoush, rice, pickled cabbage, cucumber salad, lettuce, some olives, and a couple different sauces, plus a pita.  It was just okay. $7.57 with tax, I wasn't hungry after, but doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I had a coupon and decided to check this place out. I like the concept a lot- basically, you choose between several base options (gyro, salad, pita) then a meat (gyro meat, steak or chicken kebab, etc.) and then choose from a bevy of toppings, including babaganoush and tabuleh (apologies for the spelling). You can add tzatztiki and other sauces (my favorite part of the meal). All for around $6-$9. Very affordable, especially with a buy one, get one free coupon.   My only complaints were the steak kebab meat was a bit dry and didn't taste the way I've had it at other places. I would have liked more tzatztiki sauce on my salad. The falafel was also a tad dry.   Pros: the gyro meat is delicious and my boyfriend really liked the tomato/cucumber salad (can't recall the name). The tzatztiki and pomegranate tea were very good.   I would definitely come back and order something different- maybe a salad with gyro meat and more toppings. Worth a try! And definitely not bad for a first-time experience."}
{"text":"A couple of my friends came to eat here after an event--we were so surprised at the awesomeness! We all play roller derby, so we're always looking for places to eat that are relatively healthy. We were floored that a \"Mediterranean Chipotle\" exists!  The food was awesome, the service was great. They got excited that we were so excited! We literally asked for everything on our plates.  I'm a vegetarian, and there were more than plenty of options (good options, not just dinky salad options) for me. And they practiced good glove hygiene! Not to mention all the vegetarian stuff either had tongs or scoops!  All-in-all, we had a wonderful experience here and will definitely be frequent customers!"}
{"text":"Wife and I had the Chicken Kabob plate. Very disappointed. The chicken was dry and flavorless. The saffron rice was cold. The place is very spacious and clean. Service was prompt. No one asked how the meal is.  Probably won't go back there again. Too bad, I really enjoy mid-eastern cuisine."}
{"text":"Chipotle Style- great options for everyone. Especially for vegetarians. The falafel was okay."}
{"text":"I had a traditional Gyro. It was SO fresh and the Cilantro sauce was like nothing I've tasted before. Clean environment and friendly staff. Gave great recommendations to our whole party."}
{"text":"This is the Mediterranean version of a Chipotle in the sense that you pick out what you want each step of the way. All of the ingredients were very fresh. I had a wrap with some tabbouleh and fresh red cabbage.  The chicken was a little chewy, but everything else was delicious.  My favorite part was the vegetable salad they put in my wrap.  It had fresh cucumber in it and it was a perfect lunch on a hot day. The service was very quick and the restaurant was comfortable."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place... I love mediterranean food and I think the concept is great (think chipotle meets pitas!) but execution was seriously off! I went and ordered the build your own entree and got the falafel. There were tons of choices to add on to my order and most of them were really great, but honestly their falafel was inedible. If I hadn't ordered it to go I would have taken it back, but instead I was stuck with falafels that could be utilized better by the Phoenix Coyotes as hockey pucks rather than a protein that is offered by an establishment offering fresh and healthy fare. Needless to say I was a bit turned off by my experience and I don't think I will be back. Next time I need my mediterranean fix I will head to Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"Quite average.  Definitely chipotle style.  I ordered a plate and got a LITTLE bit of everything including the meat.  Maybe I'm not all that familiar w/ mediterranean food but why do I need the same size scoop of pickle slices as my rice and chicken?  At least at chipotle they load you up.  Nothing spectacular but edible."}
{"text":"This place is great. I ordered a plate with salad, rice, chicken, hummus and a few other things and it was all delicious and a good way to sample everything. The employees were super welcoming and helpful and seemed excited to be at work! Wish I had a Garbanzo's in my area!"}
{"text":"What a great find!  We'll definitely be back!!!  Healthy choices, love the ability to choose the items that go into my meal (like Chipotle style)  and the service was super enthusiastc and friendly."}
{"text":"Loved the food here! Fast service, nice employees. Good selection to choose from"}
{"text":"Garbanzo offers up a fresh and healthier option in the Desert Ridge food court.  While it's prices aren't expensive,  I honestly would rather pay a couple dollars more and head across the street to Pita Jungle for some much better mediterranean food.  But if you're already in the district, want to avoid a wait, and/or don't feel like driving around, then Garbanzo is a more than suitable alternative.  Also; All of the employees were very friendly.  Every worker who was there on Saturday were just teenagers, but it really felt like they were going out of their way to make sure customers understood the concept of this new restaurant and had a good experience.  Ordering an entree is similar to Chipotle.  Pick your protein as chicken or steak.  Or go vegetarian with mushroom or falafel.  Choose between a pita, wrap, or plate.  Pick from an assortment of mediterranean condiments.  The food is good.  I went with a chicken pita.  I guess I'm traditional like that.  The pita is more dense than I would prefer, but I guess that keeps it from falling apart.  My wife had the chicken kabob.  It comes with hummus, rice, and a vegetable salad (pretty much just chopped up fresh cumbers and tomatoes) and a pita.  The chicken kabob itself was good.  It was cooked to order which was a pleasant surprise, but a little odd that we had to wait and extra 5 minutes for one of the meals.  But they did cooke the chicken and peppers perfectly. The plate is big, but it's filled mostly with the hummus and rice.  The hummus is okay,  not terribly flavorful, tastes a lot like a supermarket brand.  The rice and veggies were good.  The pita is the same that's used for the entrees.  Since it's so dense it doesn't work well as something to dip into the hummus.  I would say that Garbanzo is a solid 3.5 stars.  I'm rounding up to four since it's probably the healthiest option for fast food in Desert Ridge and the employees are so friendly.  I recommend at least giving it a try if you happen to be at the mall."}
{"text":"Update 2/8/16: I came into garbanzo during lunch today and loved my meal! I had the salad with chicken kabob and it came with a fresh hot pita! The friendly girl behind the counter grilled up the chicken kabob right there for me and while the kabob was grilled they asked me what I would like in my salad. I picked cucumber and tomato salad, tabouli, sautéed vegetables, hummus, onions, feta and Mediterranean garlic. There are always so many sauces go choose from so I always get sides of others to dip my chicken and pita in. I think the most unique part is the hot pita that are made to order in store fresh right behind the counter!   Thank you for the awesome, fresh, quick meal!"}
{"text":"Place was nice and clean.  Large family order in front of us from group so it was a wait for us to move through the line. Employees were not that polite as maybe they were training. I had the steak gyro which ended up being cold and chewy, but overall ok taste.  My guest had one chicken and one steak kabob which they thought tasted good. For the overall experience, it was just like other gyro places at the same price point.  If I had to make a choice, I would pick the non chain gryo place where I get more quantity and better quality in my opinon.    For a family outing with kids with the kids menu this would be a great choice."}
{"text":"This place is such a refreshing change ! I started with the plate & added a pita and falafel . All of the add ons were terrific and incredibly fresh !  Loved the tomato & cucumber salad , cilantro & jalapeño hummus , babaganoush & tabouli.  The staff were so courteous & happy! My friend just switched to Vegan and she was just as pleased with her meal & experience! Highly recommend this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This place is a Greek fast-food, chain restaurant. I wasn't overly impressed. I had the gyro which could have used a second dose of gyro meat, although the veggies were fresh. The falafel was over cooked. The restaurant was completely empty on a Monday at lunch time, sad. We had such high hopes too. I will go to Saba's or My Big Fat Greek for my gyros from now on."}
{"text":"Here are the pros and cons Pro: with coupons (found at dessert ridge office, also on the website and special events they put on) the food is reasonable. We often eat there for about $20 including drinks for 4.  The food is tasty, at least what I have tried, steak kabob, various standard sides, chips are homemade are some of the best I have ever had plus the teas are quite good, not too sweet. Cons: the person behind the counter either makes it or breaks it. We have been here 3 times and it's been inconsistent as far as portion sizes are concerned and personality of the server. I have never been offered a sample but have seen numerous other people offered.  Seems like a bunch of young unsupervised kids work there. The bad part of that is you don't know what you will get when you dine there.  Still I give it four stars because it is tasty every time."}
{"text":"Super yummy! The gyro and chicken pita were delicious. Service was wonderful and very friendly."}
{"text":"People always think I'm insane when I tell them this, but Garbanzo is surprisingly authentic. Seriously. In Israel, when you go to a falafel place, they build you a sandwich in a fresh baked pita to order. The ingredients at Garbanzo are pretty similar to what you'd get in Israel, and they're all fresh and delicious. Their babaganoush is better than the hummus, in my opinion, but they're both tasty. I'd take Garbanzo over Chipotle any day of the week for a flavorful, healthy, quick meal on a budget. I've tried a number of locations, and they all get an A+ for consistency and cleanliness as well."}
{"text":"I really was not so impressed with this \"Mediterranean\" restaurant. Yes, it had hummus. Yes, it had dolmades. Yes, it had gyro. But it was the most inauthentic tasting Mediterranean food I've had. I got the chicken pita and it was incredibly plain; no seasonings or anything. We were offered a sample of the falafel which was a mistake because it was fried waaay too long. Not a good impression. The dolmades were decent, but not worth saving this place."}
{"text":"This was my second visit- love this place. We were staying at Embassy Suites around the corner so just did gyro plates to go. All was delicious, fresh and generous portions. Don't miss the dessert cookie!"}
{"text":"I've been at least 10 times and can't get enough. Garbanzo's is perfect for vegans & vegetarians. I always get the falafel wrap with lots of add ons. The falafel is always moist and fresh. The only thing that disappointed me is they got rid of the quinoa salad. I'm still a fan but miss that salad."}
{"text":"Good value for the money. Food is mostly tasty and I like the way it's set up - you can choose whatever you want for your platter and they don't seem to ever limit you, so you end up with a good variety on your plate. I love their Tahini and cilantro sauces, though the tzatziki I find unappetizing. I like their rice a lot.   Is it the most authentic? Hardly. But it's very good and you get a lot of food for $8."}
{"text":"I ordered a salad with gyro meat. The woman making the salad dumped the contents of a plastic container out into my salad. The meat looked very dark and dry. I paid and sat down with my family to eat. The meat in my salad was black on one side. I bit into it and it was dry and inedible. My husband went back and ordered me a chicken kabob which was much better as it was very fresh. My husband should have said something but didn't. I checked in on Yelp to get the free cookie offer and was told that they would have to bake more cookies. We opted on just leaving. Very disappointing visit. Usually the gyro meat is delicious but it was very bad tonight. Not sure if I will bring my family back. FYI our bill was over $50, a lot of money for burnt food."}
{"text":"Healthy, fast, lots of choices.  The good was great,  I had a healthy salad.  Would ask for half dressing half taziki next time.  The gyro meat was a little dried out.  Falafel was really good."}
{"text":"So here is the deal. I walked in and out last week. The menu was way too confusing. I decided to try it again today was happy to see that they simplified the menu. I ordered a plate with chicken and tasted pretty much every side they offered me. The jasmine rice was horrible. The portion size was impressive but I felt like Gordon Ramsay throwing out an entire plate of food but I did. Good concept but inedible food.  The owner has already reached out to me and I plan on trying the place again. I give it a 4 now based on the staff. Very professional. Let's see if the food can raise my overall score to a 5."}
{"text":"I love this place! Super fresh ingredients and the food is spot on every time. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very good entry into the healthy quick food segment.  Prices are in line with their competitors,  the food is tasty and easily customizable."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Walked in the door and got to taste falafel.  The ingredients were fresh and after I ate my lunch I felt great .  The staff was friendly and helpful at explaining everything.  The manager Jon even came out to check on us half way through our meal and make sure everything was 100%.  I will be back and recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick, healthy lunch!"}
{"text":"Worst \"Mediterranean\" food ever. I got a gyro plate (~$9), and the meat could not have been more flavorless or cold! The employees were quiet but nice (I guess), but they literally gave me the smallest portions ever (3 pieces of onion exactly, not even a full scoop of pilaf). I don't understand why this place has 4 stars on here!  I should've just went with my gut and gotten at Panda Express instead of trying something new. :("}
{"text":"This is our first trip to Garbanzos.  Lets start with the good points.  The babaganoush was really good and so were the mushrooms.  That's all the good things I can say.  The taboulli tasted very bland, I don't think there was any lemon on it all all.  The steak did not taste very good, like almost every thing we tried it was under seasoned. I was hoping for new place to go but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Have to visit again to try different food before I give a full review..."}
{"text":"Quick and easy, but most importantly good food. Staff is always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I went there with a friend of mine who had a Groupon , it was a good deal. He had the greek salad w/Gyro meat, I choose the plate so I could try a little of everything. The falafel was okay, pre cooked and sitting for a little bit served cool, not a lot of spices but okay. The hummus was okay not very good but edible, again fell flat on flavor. The baba ganoush was the worst I have ever had, took one bite and it definitely was not fresh and tasted terrible. The Tabbouleh was okay and was much better than the hummus or the baba ganoush. The rice was good but again on the cold side. I prefer my food to be a little fresher, everything tasted like it had been sitting awhile and store-bought. My friend had the Greek Salad with the Gyro meat, the Gyro meat appeared to be from a package and thrown on the rill for about 2 to 3 mins. very thing, looked like processed food. he got maybe 2 slices, it was okay. nothing special. Granted it was fast food, every that being said it is still expensive for a fast food joint with the quality of food not there and cold pitas out of the box. Staff was nice. I probably would not go there again as I much rather go to other places like Pita Jungle at Happy hour and get better quality of food for about the same price. There is also a place in phoenix off of 7th street that makes their own falafel and it is fantastic, nice spices and fresh for about the same price. You did get a lot for your money but again I would prefer quality over quantity."}
{"text":"Had high hopes going in but it fell far from what it could have been.  Sort of a cafeteria style Pita Jungle but without great food.  Had a gyro with a side of their freshly made chips...they were soggy and limp and  maybe they were fresh earlier in the day but not when we had them.  The food would have been better if it hadn't been just lukewarm.  The meat was chunky and not sliced as it should have been .  The ice machine didn't work, the cola was not balanced with syrup and ended up with carbonated brown water.  When we went to throw out what was left on our plates, which was quite a bit, the garbage was overflowing and some of the food had no where to go but over the edge....Worst meal, we have had in quite awhile.  We love Mediterranean food but this was not a Grill...it was more like leftovers.  Certainly not worth the $20+ for lunch.  Will go to Pita Jungle from now on....good food, healthy, fresh and hot!  Save your time and money....come on Garbanzo's, you ought to be able to do better than this..."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating Garbanzos this week!  We just love it. The meal in the restaurant was fresh and delicious with incredible customer service. The owners are so nice and genuinely want to make sure you are happy with your food. The gyros with tzadiki is delicious!    We had lunch catered at my work today. Not only did they deliver but the set up was so nice. Everything was clearly labeled and the variety is incredible. Definitely an affordable and great catering option."}
{"text":"Horrible.  Chicken was dry.  They were out of pitas. Hummus not good. Out of 6 of us, most of what was ordered could not be eaten. Would not go back"}
{"text":"I've had pretty average experiences here, but today was awesome. I think the girl's name was Kristina who made my plate today and she was just so positive and gave a good balance of each ingredient which I appreciate. She was just really nice, putting this place at 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"I loved this place and food until I saw the note saying how because the minimum wage law raised, they raised their prices. I am well rehearsed in how the American economic system works, but it would be nice if a company like this put a premium on hard work instead of just making their profit. I used to work for minimum wage for a long time. And I do understand that some low level jobs shouldn't require a higher wage. That being said though, compared to 30+ years ago, no minimum salary/wage can even buy you anywhere near a home for yourself. So when companies like this raise price after the working wage has gone up, it does NOTHING to help employees. I was raised to believe hard work pays off.. I cannot say that is how it is anymore. You need to be skilled in some field that is profitable just  to make below \"average\" ends meet. That being said food is pretty good nothing special.  But worth trying"}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. It is all the ingredients that I don't have to keep at home and just around the corner from me. The food is very fresh and the spicy hummus is just right. I've eaten here several times and I would definitely return again."}
{"text":"Still disappointed about the food in front of me. Over-priced food for food that is not that plentiful or good. Chipotle across the street has a better set-up in terms of quality, value, and service. If you want to get Mediterranean, go to Saba on Tatum and Bell."}
{"text":"I got a grilled chicken wrap with hummus, tahini, cabbage, pickles, and tzaziki and it was to die for! So so good! Staff is very friendly and knowledgable. Manager (I wish I got his name... Young cute guy with a beard) was very nice to talk to and we shared a few laughs! I'm a stay at home mom so I don't always get a lot of adult interaction and it was refreshing to come in and see smiles and of course have some delicious food! My go to spot for healthy, fast, and affordable!"}
{"text":"When I feel like eating a healthy meal I stop by here, especially being close to work/home. The prices are expected and the food is always delicious. Additionally, the young staff seems very friendly."}
{"text":"Good edition to the DR.  I like the \"build your own\" options.  Only downside remains that the falafel is not very fresh.  I will definitely be back ....multiple times."}
{"text":"This restaurant is \"chipotle style \".  The food actually was pretty good. I wouldn't say it's amazing or something I'll be craving but it is good. The menu is not ss clear cut as some similar restaurants and easy to rack up a bill if you don't ask questions. Still you have lots of options.  Servers were nice and I enjoyed the cookie you can get for free with check in .  P.S. I think they've a lot of new staff so they can't really provide a whole lot of direction but they are nice and they try. I'd give 3.5 stars but can't so...3"}
{"text":"We were very excited to try this place! It's very similar to chipotle but Mediterranean food. It's was great, we both got the plate with falafel and chicken. That way we got a chance to try everything without the flavors being mixed up.   The employees were very friendly and helpful. The employee behind the counter gave us samples of all the sauces and falafel. I would recommend trying this restaurant."}
{"text":"Tasty fast food with options for Vegetarians and Vegans. Just moved to the Paradise Valley area and this is hands down my favorite place for a healthier quick meal option.   They are not stingy with the portions and I always leave slightly stuffed.   So far I've had the build your own plate which I could barely finish and today the gyro. Both chock full of flavorful goodness.  Bonus: my to-go bag read: \"Live Bait\" which is funnier than they know because there are some unscrupulous people at my office who like to steal other people's food. Way to throw 'em off the scent, Garbanzo.  Hope you guys are here to stay..."}
{"text":"Rice was greasy. Overall food is good but fell flat in quantity. Serving size should be worked on."}
{"text":"This place definitely has a ton of options. I always go for a chicken kebab platter when i get mediteranian food. The thing that turned me off at first was when the cashier took two kebabs from a warming oven and threw them on a cook top for less than a minute and then placed it on the platter. That doesnt read \"fresh\" to me. They were fine temperature and taste wise but i just couldnt get over how weird that was. Why not truly make it fresh since that is this whole places motto?? I would have happily waited for it.  The rice I got was ok. I love rice in general so I ate a decent amount of it but the entire time I was thinking about finding better rice somewhere else.  I did not care for the hummus. It had a strange taste. The pita bread was alright but I felt the same way as I did about the rice.  I almost forgot about the cucumber salad that also came with it. Thats a perfect way to describe how it tasted. Forgettable.  Service was good. But i would rather have sub par service than sub par food.  Try Pita Cafe for better greek food."}
{"text":"Great casual place for a quick and healthy meal. Lots of combinations with the build-your-own menu"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit to Garbanzo. I ordered the \"plate\" with gyro meat, cuke tomato salad, red cabbage, lettuce, tabouleh, and hummus. I was naughty and also accepted the pita... I sampled the tsatziki sauce, tahini sauce, and cilantro sauce. Sound like a ton of food?!? It is! Huge portions. I will definitely be returning. The service I received was awesome! So very rare these days. The restaurant was busy and they were keeping it tidy. Another plus. The gyro meat was very tender and cooked properly but was WAY under seasoned. Very blah. This surprised me because I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor in all the rest. I'm picky about tsatziki and I thought this one was excellent. Could taste dill, garlic and lemon. Both of the other sauces were equally well spiced and very tasty with the THREE meals this one plate served me. Tabouleh always disappoints me in restaurants because it never has any flavor. This one did! I could taste spices and parsley aand probably a lot of salt. It was proper. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will get it in a salad next time. The cucumber tomato salad was good too. Very fresh and crisp. Did not try seasonal veggies, falafel, or babaganoush this time. May not ever. I really loved the choices I made with the exception of the gyro meat. If there is lamb in there, it is a wee tiny lamb who tastes just like beef. One thing to be aware of is that their mint lemonade is yummy! But...brace yourselves... One 24 oz serving is 450 calories!!!!! NEVER AGAIN! In a place that flaunts healthy, this surprised me. Lesson learned, treadmill greased. Still...count me in for repeat visits for weekday lunches or hurry home dinners."}

{"text":"Totally agree with Rachel's posting. Was going to eat somewhere else, but decided to try this place. Ordered a gyro and while watching the guy make it, it was ridiculous how stingy he was in putting the tzatziki sauce on. At the end, I asked for some garlic sauce and that was also sparsely added. I've never had a more flavorless gyro in my life. None of the sauces had any flavor and the entire thing was bland. The vegetables ended up being the best tasting thing. Other people have more favorable reviews on different dishes, but I'm not risking, or wasting my money again.  If you find yourself at Desert Ridge, randomly throw a stone and find a better place to eat."}
{"text":"Quick, fast service. Meat (chicken) could be of better quality (less fat content) .. But better quality than chipotle!! I've been here under a dozen times. With offers to sample falafels for free...to being out of meat towards the end of their business day. :-/ Overall, fresh veggies, tasty hummus and good dressings.. However you don't need extra dressing with cucumber salad and tabouli added to salad.. Plenty of flavor. Check-in and receive a free cookie. Yum!"}
{"text":"well well well... where to start....   I could start bashing them because the meat in my shwarma was cold.. or I could start bashing them because their chicken tasted more like taco meat or because their \" pita bread\" was the size of my hand and reminded me more of a shingle than of anything one would usually eat... but I think I'll start bashing them because two outta three of our shwarmas were wrapped with tortillas and looked like burritos.. cold burritos... I didn't realize that Mexico was part of the Mediterranean.. I gave it to stars instead of one because one person in our group, the one who didn't want Mediterranean food lol, actually enjoyed their meal..."}
{"text":"My 1st visit to a Garbanzo's and I was initially overwhelmed at all the choices. I explained that I just wanted a Gyro. What I got was a most incredible classic gyro with fresh, crispy vegetables, perfectly seasoned gyro meat and tangy sauce all on a great flat bread."}
{"text":"My wife and I were so happy when a casual Mediterranean restaurant opened in Desert Ridge.  Well, we're not so happy any more.  Three strikes and you're out.  Strike 1: Incomplete order The first time we visited, we ordered takeout.  I ordered a dessert with my meal.  Lo and behold, when I got home, there was no dessert in the bag.  Strike 2: Burnt food On our second visit, I ordered a felafel sandwich.  The felafels were burnt.  Strike 3: Overcharging Phoenix New Times advertised that during Valentines week, when you buy an entree, you get one free, plus a free dessert.  My wife asked the first employee about the offer, and he told her that she was correct.  However, after ordering the food and getting to the register, the next employee said that he knew nothing about this offer and wouldn't honor it.  What a shame, they had so much potential."}
{"text":"Great fast service and decent taste.. It's a healthy and tasty fast food."}
{"text":"Yum and super friendly in here! I wish the meat was freshly cut in front of you (gyro meat) but that is the only downfall. It is like a chipotle for Mediterranean food! Great if you are like me and love a Greek salad! They also have wheat pitas too!"}
{"text":"The guys behind the counter are very helpful and spent plenty of time explaining how to order. They are generous with portions, the hunks of chicken on the kabobs are huge and there are so many vegetarian options as well. The falafel and hummus was delicious as we're the sauces. And it's healthy!!!"}
