{"text":"Momoji is our go-to place for any special occasions. It's an expensive place but they serve very fresh and tasty sushi. They have the bento box which typically would have meat of your choice, sushi and some sort of veggies. Their other sushi choices are also great. The service has always been great whenever we go. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went here on my way home from Costco.  Wanted to get my fix of salmon, and boy, did this place do the job.  Got the lunch Salmon special, and it was tasty.  The service was great, and the ambiance was good."}
{"text":"Momiji was our go-to sushi spot in the West End for the last six months, but that'll change after the poor service on our last visit.   We arrived after 7pm on a Monday night. While the restaurant wasn't close to being full, the young woman who served us seemed to be in a daze the entire time--we couldn't tell if she was brand new, overwhelmed by the number of tables in her section, high on something, or some combination of the three.   One of us ordered a couple appetizers, the other ordered one of the sushi combos and requested no sesame seeds. It took almost 30 minutes to get soup/salad/edamame, while tables around us that ordered at the same time received their entrees. After bringing the first course, the server asked what else we had ordered--not a good sign. We repeated our orders, and when we reiterated the request for no sesame seeds on the sushi, she responded with a strange non sequitur: \"Oh, right, you'd like to share.\" Huh?  When she finally brought the sushi and \"entree\" appetizer after another 15-20 minutes, the sushi combo's roll was covered in sesame seeds. When we told the server, she could have just brought over a replacement roll and left the seed-free nigiri for us to eat. Instead, she whisked the entire plate away. After another 20 minutes had passed with no sign of getting the sushi combo back, we paid for the appetizers and left. We likely will not return."}
{"text":"This place has the laziest service ever. I keep going back hoping that the service will become more attentive but it never changes. It is NOT acceptable to wait over 1 minute to be greeted at the table! And then after the food is served I never see my server again until I hunt them down myself for the bill, like literally go and FIND them.  I'd be willing to accept  poor service if the food was outstanding but that is not the case.   Five hundred strikes-You're out, Momiji!"}
{"text":"Had a huge hankering for some sushi and living in South Etobicoke, i have been disappointed before.  So after checking Yelp this place had good reviews and seemed to be promising.    Now not to begin on a bad note, but the only criticism I have is that the hostess seemed completely uninterested in doing his job. We got there and the guy was busy on his cell and surfing the web. After waiting 5 mintues he helped us to our seat which was right beside him! That is where the crap stopped.   We ordered the salmon sushi pizza, the spicy tuna rolls, dynamite rolls and of course the clutch cali rolls. All were super delicious and fresh, rolled tightly and not half assed.   Our server was quick and polite. Took his time and we didn't feel rushed at all, especially considering it was packed and there was a line of customers waiting."}
{"text":"Once of my fav place to go for great quality sushi when in the area. Expensive but quality of sashimi said it all:) been there 3 times so far, all enjoyable food, great rolls:)"}
{"text":"We began comming here about five years ago when there weren't many restaurants offering sushi in Etobicoke or west end Toronto. In general the sushi is fresh and well presented. You can see the chefs preparing it as you sit at your table. The other items on the menu were good too. I loved the soba noodles in broth. But in the last year or so, while the sushi remains good and fresh, and I still like the soba noodles in broth, the other items on the menue have deteriorated. The Love Boat is beautiful to look at but tastless, the shrimp tempura is unedible with large chunks of oil based, batter fried brocoli, sweet potato and gigantic green pepper rings arranged in a first impressions mountain on the plate. Go somewhere else for anything but the shushi and the soba noodle soup."}
{"text":"The service here is pretty crap but the food is so good and plated so beautifully that I don't care. Sashimi, rolls, appetizers were all good. Didn't get to try the mains (teriyaki, don, meat dishes, etc.) Or their soupy stuff (udon, etc.), but I will be back to try the rest of their menu. Their interior is nice and the place is clean and modern as well. To be honest, this place could be someone's living room and I wouldn't mind because it's hard to find japanese food of this quality around here."}
{"text":"The Blue Mountain Roll is a must to order!   It's more than just a \"roll\"; it's a gastronomic masterpiece of tempura bits, spicy mayo, fresh salmon topped off a delectable roll of more spicy salmon, cucumber, and avocado wrapped in soy bean sheet (instead) of  the usual seaweed.  It's enough for 3 people and is bursting with flavour and freshness.  The restaurant itself is priced higher than neighbouring sushi restaurants, but it's well worth it.  If you don't fancy the special rolls, then I'd suggest getting a combo from their lunch menu or sushi/sashimi combo dishes.    One star short of a perfect rating because of price."}
{"text":"The best Sushi Place in Etobicoke for sure. The ambiance is very nice the only set back was we found the music a bit too loud. And for non-sushi eaters who feel tortured by the smell of raw fish, Momiji doesn't smell too \"fishy\" at all. So next time you are in Etobicoke looking for a Sushi Place check out Momiji Sushi Bar and Grill it's so worth it."}
{"text":"Came for a weekday lunch; ordered a sushi sashimi bento and a sushi lunch special.  Food: Fish was generally fresh and sized to cover the nigiri rice and then some.  Unfortunately the white tuna was water logged and all the nigiri rice was overly sweet.  Miso soup was too salty and needed tea to be added to be drinkable.  Tempura was well done - very thinly battered while still retaining enough crispy bits.  Service: Attentive and prompt.  Several refills of our tea.   Setting:  Modern decor.  Very clean bathrooms.  Nicer than most sushi places.  Free parking is available, which is a plus given the area, but we were not lucky enough to snag a space.  Overall: Lunch special prices are higher than most similar calibre GTA sushi lunch specials.  Not compelled to return for the food.  Space and service may make it a good place for a date or business lunch."}
{"text":"Good sushi option on Bloor West"}
{"text":"Momiji is one of the restaurants I crave to go. I heard there have been internal changes with chefs and staff which is maybe why they got some not so great reviews. I've only experienced awesome-ness every time I went.  My girlfriends and I have coined this as one of our favorite spots for lunch.  I wanted to take pictures so bad but when the food came all I was thinking was what do I eat first XD! I'll take pictures next time if my tummy lets me.  We ordered...  + Korean Style beef tartar - It used to be completely raw but I don't mind the new lightly seared version. I love it that they don't cheapen out on the pears, like some places.  +Tuna Tataki - beautifully plated, lightly seared tuna. Very tasty, it's a nice starter to your meal  +Sushi Cake - (A MUST ORDER!!!) It is my favourite item on the menu. When I order it I don't even want to share. But it's good for 3 people to share I suggest; that way you still have room to eat other things. Pay the extra $1 to make it spicy =)  +Crab cake - (Did not like) this was disappointing. It reminded me of fried, flat \"Vietnamese pork roll\" or (Cha Lua) if anyone knows what I mean. It had no volume, and it was dry. I recommend you pass on ordering this item; it is not what you would expect.  +Zebra Roll - (A MUST ORDER!!!) This roll heavenly melted in my mouth. I'm drooling as I write this. Shrimp Tempura, avocado, cucumbers crab, masago topped with BBQ eel and white tuna with momiji mayo, drenched in a buttery mouth watering unagi sauce.  I've tried many other items but these are my most memorable. I heard sweet things about the blue mountain roll which I'm going to order next time.  Service for me overall I've never had a problem with. The servers spoke English fluently and knew their wines. Very polite and kind.  I hate eating at restaurants that look dirty. Momiji looks clean and modern yet it still has traditional decor. Clean and cute. Not \"ghetto\" at all!  Even though the crab cakes are a no no, there is so much more that I loved. I've tried Momiji many times and I keep wanting to come back for more. 5 stars it is!"}
{"text":"really enjoy this place. not a huge sushi fan, but this place has become a go to. Tuna Tataki is absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"This is a great place.  It is clean, comfortable, the food is good and the staff are friendly. For me the Miso soup at a Japanese restaurant is the first test of quality.  The Miso soup here is good. Very good. The rolls were good.  the sushi good. the udon good. Our waitress was very friendly. Everything was proper. Maybe not world class, but perfectly tasty. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our server was really charming, knew the menu well and was very attentive.  We had the seaweed salad, shrimp and veggie tempura, yaki gyoza, white dragon roll, spider dragon roll and the volcano roll.  I found the tempura a bit oily and the batter a bit much.  What the restaurant lacks in appetizers, they make up in the main course.  Check out my full review with pics here - lilmissbubz.com"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time. We ordered the sushi pizza that I've heard so much about, tuna and salmon sashimi, spicy salmon roll and BBQ eel roll. The pizza was every bit as awesome as everyone has told me. The \"crust\" is made of deep fried rice and the toppings are good. This dish is very filling. The sashimi was ok but not great. It didn't have a taste or texture like it was freshly cut. I suspect that it is prepared all at once and then served throughout the day. That being said, it wasn't off at all and I didn't think twice about eating it. The rolls were good and we really enjoyed them. The service was great and our server was very attentive. The experience wasn't awful but there are plenty of sushi places that have better food"}
{"text":"I found it to be over rated. Nice atmousphere but the service was not that great. I had the BBQ chicken roll and BBQ salmon roll and it was not good at all. I love sushi and is from the west coast so I know good sushi but this just isnt it."}
{"text":"I was at their all-you-can eat jazz night with the conveyor belt. Excellent quality, and the service is perfect. I'm coming back again and again. Steps from Royal York Station means that you have no excuse for not trying it out."}
{"text":"We didn't eat sushi there, but California or Alaska roll at $9 is reeeally overpriced. Three fish tartar was nice, yet again way overpriced for the amount of fish you get. Shrimp tempura was good.  The reason this place gets 4 stars is attentive service - and surprisingly good desserts. I don't have a picture of banana melange, which was awesome, but here is a picture of a trio creme brulee. I would suggest Momiji as a dessert place, not a sushi spot."}
{"text":"Good sushi for Bloor West Strip. This one is closer to Royal York. Very typical creations, good quality and reasonable prices. I feel some of these other reviews are over the top. It is a decent neighbourhood sushi bar. Their service is adequate but inconsistent.  Excellent choice if you are on the Kingsway and not sure where to eat. Their dining room and space is quite impressive."}
{"text":"Out of all the places I've been in Toronto, this is by far the best one!! The fish is always fresh, the dishes are delicious and satisfying!  I strongly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed! I ate there at least 3 times, so I can have an pertinent opinion. The \"Udon\" was fine.  I was upset with the poor service last time. The server - a girl -  did not work for her tip. I had to grab napkins and chop sticks from another table, because she did not bother to bring any... The place was empty, it was 12 pm, so I was expecting much better customer service for this kind of restaurant.  I got better service in fast food restaurants.  I had to ask for more water a few times, the waitress did not bother to serve us with  water. We order beef teriaki and chicken teriaki. Nothing remarkable. I stop going to this place because of the low service.  The poor service is unacceptable. If you do not treat me nice, you do not deserve my money."}
{"text":"Went there after work with my partner and we had an excellent meal.  Sushi rolls were excellent indeed.  My partner ordered Udon and was extremely happy.  The tab, after tax but before tip was $84 for both of us - I had a glass of wine and J had a warm Sake.  Not cheap, but very fair for the quality (and the quantity, we took a \"doggie bag\" home) of the food.  Service was generally very good and attentive, and the decor was pleasing and clean.  We will most definitely come back."}
{"text":"Ordered sushi love boat. Everything looks excellent.  Only Hamachi Sashimi was very thinly sliced...so odd as a Japanese.  Tuna wasn't fresh at all, displayed oddly again. (chucked? )  However, Uni, Ikura sushi were good but it was not great though. Overall, all the sushi rolls were good too even these were not authentic."}
{"text":"Yet another great sushi place in Etobicoke that I love to go to from time to time is Momiji Sushi Bar & Grill on Bloor Street & Royal York.  This place is more upscale and fancier than your typical sushi restaurants, so I like to go on special occasions.  They have a small space for parking beside the restaurant, but it's usually pretty full as they share with other places in the plaza.  There's another parking lot across the street, which has way more space.  It's also a very walkable distance from Royal York TTC Station.  The atmosphere is romantic and warm - perfect for a date.  The servers are super friendly and doting as well.  They check up on your frequently during your time there and make sure you have everything you need.  For starters, you get the typical salad and miso soup and the appetizer (if you order any).  we got the shrimp & vegetable tempura.  The tempura is delicious here.  Perfectly crispy and you can tell the freshness of the shrimp.  The vegetables were yummy as well.  Finaly, the main... I love getting the love boat combos or love bridge combos - they are a combination of nigiris, sashimis and various rolls on a boat or a bridge.  It's perfect for sharing and is of good value.  There are different sizes you can choose as well.  For this visit, we were hungry, so we got the Love Bridge B.  The nigiri sushi isn't the freshest I've tasted but the rolls were pretty good.  I really loved the dynamite rolls and the spicy salmon rolls here.  Overall, it's a great place for a date - but the price is a bit more expensive compared to other sushi places locally... This is probably because of their service standards and atmosphere they're trying to create.  I've had my friend say that they served her bad sushi here twice - so this place was a miss for her.  But so far, for me it's a hit!"}
{"text":"I was introduce to this place by a friend. I am always looking for great sushi in and around Toronto. I ordered the sashimi romance, chef choice of 25 pieces. I thought there would be more of a variety instead 4 different type of fish, unevenly cut. It had 12 pieces of salmon. Some of the other pieces of Fish had blood on it, by pass that. For 30 dollars I get more variety and better tasting sushi at a all you can eat. The quaility of the fish is questionable, it didn't sit well with my stomach and now paying for it. For sure I won't be going back, for that price I rather go to fushimi on chruch, hosu yonge and eglinton, or sushi on bloor."}
{"text":"Good points first: Prettily decorated, large place which suits big groups. They offer wifi. Their soft shell crab was huge and very tasty.  Unfortunately, the service was lacking. My friend and I stood waiting to be seated while the hostess and waitresses chatted, even though 2 kitchen employees saw us, they chose to continue chatting. After we were seated and we ordered our drinks, we were approached for orders 4 times despite telling them we wanted to wait for a friend to arrive first. The menu offered a lot of variety but their sushi & sashimi did not stand out when compared to joints like sushi on bloor or other popular sushi places which cost less."}
{"text":"All I can say is, if you're ever in Etobicoke and craving some sushi, this is the place to go!  I've been there twice now and both times it's been amazing.  At first I thought it was pretty expensive.  Dynamite roll is about $12.00.  But when it came out I quickly changed my mind.  You get A LOT of sushi!!  Two of us had: Dynamite Roll: Tempura shrimp, crabmeat, avocado, cucumber Red Dragon Roll: Shrimp, crabmeat, avocado, cucumber topped with salmon and Sushi Pizza: selection of raw fish with mix veg assortment  That fed the 2 of us quite well.  The bill came to $60 with two beers and two glasses of wine.  If you omit the booze, it's definitely a good deal for this kind of quality.  The atmosphere is clean and chic and the service is usually pretty attentive.  Highly recommend this little gem"}
{"text":"AMAZING AMAZING sushi. Best in the area hands down.  Everything I've ever ordered here has been really delicious. Very clean and professional, excellent service. Would defintiely return over and over.  Yes it is a little pricey, but it's definitely reflected in the HUGE portion sizes and how delicious and fresh their food is!  Things I've tried and LOVED: Mushroom Butter Yaki Spicy Sushi Cake (MUST MUST TRY) Albacore Tuna Salad F.W.D. Fire White Dragon Roll  Blue Mountain Roll (man this is huge and comes with a mountain of spicy salmon and tempora bits) New Face Roll"}
{"text":"I had higher expectations for this place both due to positive reviews and, frankly, costly pricing of the menu ($4 miso soup!?). Momiji did NOT deliver. While service was good, pleasant and polite, the food was just middle of the road. My yardstick is the salmon sashimi. It has to be thinly sliced, not too fatty, easy to chew. None of that was achieved here. On the other hand, rolls topped with unagi (bbq eel) didn't even register as such because the slices were so thin and measly. Not impressed."}
{"text":"This place is consistently good with a large selection of premium Japanese fare. All that I've ever had is great but some standouts include their mixed yakatori (chicken, beef and lamb) and the Volcano Roll (which is served in grades of heat, I got \"Hotter than Hell\"). Delicious. Trust the other great reviews. They're all true."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. I find the service can be a bit slow. Can never go wrong with miso soup here and a salmon avacado roll!"}
{"text":"Went here with my wedding party after our rehearsal and was really pleased with the experience. Momiji is the Japanese word for maple leaf as a homage to their Canadian japanese fusion menu. I touching sentiment. The server was very polite and informative as my in laws aren't 100% fluent in English and tend to have questions about the menu. One thing I didn't like was that the food came out at very different stages with one half of the table almost eating completely before the second half. I understand there is one sushi chef and he can only work so fast but I think it would have been ideal to wait on the sushi boats and bring them together for everyone to enjoy. The food was really delicious, fresh ginger and sushi tasted clean and well done. Visually beautiful as well with a nice arrangement of the sushi boats and other dishes we had. I would love to go back again!"}
{"text":"Momiji is one of my favorite spots for sushi... not only is their sushi amazing but their service is on point!  Ive never had issues here whether it may be for take out or dine in.  Very clean setting...you can choose the booths or open tables.   Incase some of you are wondering, yes the servers do speak English fluently.   I would recommend getting  Volcano Blue Mountain Momiji dragon   I really like their tuna tataki as well.  Overall, anything that i have gotten from here was good!   Love this place...I will come back again and again."}
{"text":"Food here is so delicious and fresh! We ordered the sushi pizza as an appetizer and it was so big, could easily share between 5 people. We went for lunch and ordered the lunch specials, including the bento box which was a really good deal for the amount of food you get. Everything tasted really good.  My only complaint was that the service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"I'm more of a fan of traditional looking Japanese restaurants. This place is attached to Swiss Chalet and had that fake fancy fast food feel - hard to explain. Food was quite good and the portions were massive but there are better sushi restaurants in Toronto that are cheaper. Not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Momiji reminds me of the sushi restaurants in the U.S. The rolls are gigantic and almost everything has tempura bits mixed into it, and man is it ever tasty despite its inauthenticity.   I find the sashimi is cut a bit on the thick side. Particularly the salmon sashimi, so I would skip this. But the rolls are very, very tasty.   I highly recommend the blue mountain roll - spicy salmon with bits of salmon tempura. SO good and big. A great dish for sharing.     The ambience is nice, the service is always good."}
{"text":"Best spicy tuna hand-roll (cone - if you are from Vancouver like me ). Honestly, I don't know if it's because I've been gone from Canada for 4 years and haven't had a canadian style one with bits of tempura but this is all I crave now. The tables and layout are basic yet functional and things are a bit pricy but really delicious. I also had the kalbi salad (BBQ short rib) and it was great. This isn't necessarily a first date spot to impress someone (I think ambiance and something unique are the most important for the first few dates) but a good casual sushi place with friends....or like once you reach the date when you stop doing your hair and make-up...or is that just me"}
{"text":"It's slim pickings for sushi lovers in Etobicoke, but Momiji is hands down my favourite sushi restaurant in that part of the GTA. (Apparently, Kaji Sushi http://www.yelp.ca/biz/sushi-kaji-restaurant-etobicoke is PHENOMENAL and world known, but unfortunately it would burn a hole in my pocket to dine there.)  If you're a Momiji newbie, your first thought while viewing the menu will be \"damn, it's pretty expensive.\" But once your food selections start appearing, you'll be thinking \"phew, it's pretty worth it\".  Rolls are larger than the standard $8 priced rolls and they have one of the best udon soups I have tasted in Ontario. Service is efficient and friendly. Ambiance is classy and alluring plus they have cute AND very clean washrooms.   WARNING: should you order udon as a starter, don't, I repeat DON'T order a bunch of rolls and sushi as you normally would because YOU WILL have too many leftovers.  For west-enders, if you're looking for an upscale, cool date spot for dinner, but don't want to pay the big bucks or roam all the way downtown for quality sushi, Momiji Sushi Bar and Grill is the restaurant you're looking for. The probability of getting lucky afterwards will be high! (You can thank me later.)"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite sushi spot in Etobicoke (like almost everybody else who's written a review!).  The staff is awesome and friendly, food is always super fresh and authentic. I've been coming here for years and have never been disappointed. A tad pricey but 110% worth it.   Easily accessible by TTC (Royal York station) so I wouldn't suggest driving as the parking lot kinda sucks. If you insist on driving, park in the back of the subway station and do the 2 minute walk to avoid their awkward parking lot.  Apart from that, I love this place! Would definitely suggest it."}
{"text":"Great food! Menu is full of unique and delicious maki sushi! #sogood"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! My lady and I came here after a long day of shopping. It was busy. But the service was awesome. There was only 2 of us and a small table for two available but as soon as a bigger table opened up, they offered to move us without us asking. In addition the staff is so friendly and you never have to flag them down as they are on top of their service game. Then there's the food. Blue mountain roll, spider dragon roll and saigo roll are delicious!! But he warned they are filling. The presentation is excellent and the sales they come with are tasty. We never eat side salads or finish them in most restaurants but had to here because it was so good. Love coming here and will be back to try a new roll next time!"}
{"text":"Momiji has nice romantic ambience. Great place to go out on a date. They have a lot of unique items on the menu.   Their specialty sushi rolls have a lot of flavour which makes you keep wanting more.   The only cons about this restaurant is the pricey menu and the server attentiveness. They tend to get busy and are unaware of when we need refill of water and clearing out plates.   The volcano tuna dish was not as good as expected. The only bright side of that was the volcano effect (fire). However, the FWD maki rolls were excellent. I would definitely order that again.   I would go back and try the many other items on the menu."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi restaurant in Etobicoke! Note: there is a parking lot but it is fairly small, so expect to have to look for paid street parking nearby."}
{"text":"Momiji is one of my favourite sushi restaurants. The food is top notch and they have a good selection of maki rolls. My favourite is their spicy salmon roll which is ACTUALLY spicy unlike all other restaurants I've been to.  Service is usually good. It's too bad they don't offer AYCE but they do have good bento box options so that usually suffices for me."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, fresh sushi, sashimi, salads and soups. I used to go to another local sushi restaurant for years, and sometimes still do, but this one has stepped the quality and service up a notch. Very attentive service staff make this restaurant my new go-to for a trendy, fresh, and delicious Japanese cuisine experience."}
{"text":"I'm a strict vegetarian visiting from Miami. When my girlfriend introduced me to this gem I was in heaven with all the vegetarian options listed on their menu! My favorite salad is the avocado one with their special delicious sauce and I absolutely can't resist their veggie rolls. I love dipping them in my salad dressing... so yummy!"}
{"text":"Driving by the place it seemed to be the better option (decoration wise) than lots of other options I passed on the same street.  A corner decorated with well planned and good looking wood, inviting lights, some people inside, warm, alluring...  They have some daily deals for drinks.  Don't come here if you think all sushi places are cheap. Bring a date you like, because the ambiance is going to help (sausages are going to complain for sure cuz is not an AYCE).  The most memorable texture and flavor I got from here was the appetizer: a three some of tartars that melted in our mouths, that were juicy and flavorful.  From the rolls I tasted:  The beef with enoki: the beef was too dry; for sure frozen before. It had inviting smell when it came, with crunchy enoki rooms, and nice stripes of saute onion.  My favorite roll was the spicy salmon because it was perfectly shaped, with plenty of Salmon, and the eel on top was really tender.  The zebra roll was difficult to eat on a single bite, so I couldn't appreciate the conjugation of flavors.  The service was attentive, fast, and accurate. He gently charged my phone and gave us extra butter candies. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Better add a dollar sign to this profile! New menu changes always mean higher prices, but based on my principles, (I like to put my money where my mouth is)- I won't be coming back anymore. I've been a regular customer for 6yrs, and have been through menu changes before. The service was pleasant today, however, many times over the years it has been hit and miss. When I start feeling that customer satisfaction is not a priority at an establishment, I certainly won't give them any more of my money. Loyalty should be reciprocal. The best deal here is still the avocado salad. The ambience is nice (for a Saturday night), but if you want good (or better) sushi make your way west another few blocks and hit the more reasonably priced Gojima on the south side of Bloor, just east of Islington."}
{"text":"The service here can definitely be awful at times but I keep coming back because the food is just so good. Order everything at once because you may not see your server again for a while"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! The place is always clean with great decor. They have an extensive menu list with a great selection of specialty maki rolls. If you haven't already try the volcano roll- it's not only tasty but the presentation is awesome. Great quality,  great service and always a good time."}
{"text":"Momiji is one of my favourite sushi restaurants in Etobicoke. It's in a convenient location (Bloor and Royal York) and there's always ample parking either on their private lot or the many green p lots in the surrounding area. The décor is trendy with some Japanese pieces scattered throughout the restaurant. It's perfect for a date or drinks with friends. I wouldn't bring kids here unless it's lunch time.    I've been coming here for years and have ordered a variety of things from the menu. An old favourite is the Volcano special maki roll. It comes lit on fire, how cool is that? Recently, I find myself gravitating towards the same few things. They are the chirashi dinner, the sushi cake, and the sea urchin (uni) sushi. Momiji is one of the few restaurants that always have uni so I always order it. I usually get the sushi cake without the fried bits on top since I don't like them. The chirashi alone is enough to fill me up but I like to indulge when I go out to eat so I get the sushi cake and uni sushi too. If you want something more \"fun\" they've got an extensive menu full of special rolls if that's your thing.   Service is friendly and they are always very receptive to any dietary restrictions or substitutions/changes you want to make to any items on the menu. The only thing that I don't like about Momiji is their desserts. I've ordered a few things (churros, cake, ice cream) and they have been mediocre.   Overall, Momiji is an average sushi restaurant if compared to all of Toronto but I think one of the best ones in Etobicoke."}
{"text":"I got there at 5pm on 22nd December 2017. The place was almost empty. So I thought I could get better service if they are not yet busy. It took 20 minuets to someone finally come and take order. As I was waiting for my order more people arrived for dinner but still total chaos in staff and service. I counted 7 staff I the kitchen but no one gave any attention to the customers. To make it worse the sushi that I received smelled old and tasted like ocean. Only two pieces though, the rest was ok.  Now I am back to my place and think about salmonella and food poisoning.  I told the staff repeatedly but they just kids. I asked the waitress at least 3 times to tell the chef about old fish he gives to people.  He can kill people. I had such a nightmare experience in Momji. Even I told them they didn't care. At least I didn't leave any tip."}
{"text":"Momiji has very creative chefs. Dishes are always beautifully platted sometimes you even get FIYAHHHH!!! I mean who doesnt like fire... xD  Top rolls to order: I suggest you share all these rolls. They are much bigger than your average rolls.  Don't be weird and order to yourself only. Youll be sorry you didnt share so you could enjoy more variety.  [x]The volcano roll is to die for. Very generous portions of red tuna, it felt endless and I loved it. I also enjoyed the crunchy crispy bits that was just thrown on.  [x]When I think about the FIRE WHT DRAGON roll my mouth waters. Drenched in a house special butter sauce it truly melts in your mouth.  [x]Blue mountain roll - a spicy salmon, tempura bits, cucumbrr and avocado all wrap in a soy bean sheet and shaped like a mountain.   Appetizers & others:  -Spicy sushi cake is a must *must be the spicy version* I find the regular one too dry. -the trio appetizier -tuna tataki  Service is 4/5. I do feel like I have trouble getting their attention. I come here quite often and I notice that I ask for the bill before im done eating because Im afraid when im done ill be waiting awhile. But nonetheless great personalities and very professional."}
{"text":"I used to like this place. Not anymore. Reason? Their miso soup. It tasted and smelled like detergent. I tried my husband's and it was the same. We asked for new ones because really, all you have to do is put some miso paste in hot water. Not even two minutes later, we got our new miso soups and they were the exact same salty dish soap concoction.   I had expected the chef to at least taste the disaster he had created. It's only miso (there weren't even enoki mushrooms or tofu or anything). The fact that they brought the exact same soap soup out for the second time tells me that 1. Their hygiene in the kitchen is questionable to say the least and 2. They're not concerned at all about what their customers think. I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"I've been to Momiji a number of times over the last year and love the food. If I'm not in the mood for sushi the Kaibi is a great alternative. But let's be real. 95 per cent of the time I am all about the sushi. The Blue Mountain roll is as awesome as everyone says it is. Spicy salmon roll wrapped with soybean paper topped with a mouthwatering concoction of sashimi, tempura bits and cucumber. The Volcano  roll is similar, but made with tuna. The only reason Momiji isn't getting a perfect review is because of price and service. The waitstaff is polite enough but not very attentive. I had to ask for water (twice), the dessert menu and the bill."}
{"text":"Recently ordered take out here and the food was very good so we decided to come in one day for dinner. I had the steak teriyaki. It was perfect. My girlfriend ordered the sushi cake. It was huge even though it was an appetizer. So big she cancelled for main. I thought it would be similar to one of sushi pizza where they deepfried the rice cake. This sushi cake is actually very good. Pressed sushi rice with spicy salmon and tempura bits, with mixed green and spicy mayo... if I remember correctly.  The only downsize is their drinks are not very strong. My vodka-soda tasted like water"}
{"text":"Good quality, excellent service.  The sushi's not spectacular imo but the rest of their menu is great  The place is still relatively new so you get very good bang for your buck"}
{"text":"Had a late dinner at Momiji and found the found and service excellent. We ordered the beef tartare to start and it was well seasoned with sesame oil and presented on a bed of apple slices which balanced out the flavour. The sushi and sashimi were good as well. Nothing spectacular but fresh and more than the fish you find at all you can eat places. There presentation for all dishes was very on point as well. I also ordered udon noodles with beef for my main. Their broth was flavourful but their beef slices were the same ones used in Korean glabi and was in chunks within my broth however they were generous with their beef portions. Lastly, we had the creme brûlée trio to finish off our meal. The matcha and sesame creme brûlée was creamy and delicious. Our sugar tops were a bit burnt but we simply removed  them and ate the filling below. Overall, the service was very attentive and that added to our dining experience. Lovely restaurant for a la carte sushi!"}
{"text":"Truly awful Tired fishy mushy omakase  Just dreadful Why why why Semi rotten fish   Zero imagination  Avoid this place"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great ambiance, the sushi is tasty and really good portions. It's on the pricier side, but it's the best sushi in the area."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi especially in the west end. The quality is great and tastes very fresh. The price is quite a bit higher than most but the atmosphere and quality is certainly worth the added cost. We often host large groups 8-12 here for birthdays especially and have also done Mother's day for our extended family. The sushi boats are great as are the special rolls. We have also attended many of their jazz nights and have never been disappointed. Better wine selection than most other sushi places I have visited.  Also highly recommend the dragon tongue which is a weird appetizer that I accidentally tried and order every time since (asparagus with smoked salmon and a white sauce)."}
{"text":"terrible service- servers were understaffed. we waited over 20 minutes without getting water or tea.  substitutions which used to be allowed were prohibited for the lunch special. definitely not in favour of pleasing the customer.  sushi at lunch time really not high quality.  DO NOT GO HERE. waste of money"}
{"text":"I tried a lot of sushi places around the GTA as well as in the US. Momiji has the best tasting rolls. The maki specialty rolls are very unique, my favourite is the Alba on Fire which has avocado, cucumber, crab, tuna, green onion, and a special mayo sauce. I would like to recommend it to anyone not just for its food but also for its relaxed and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Sushi is really not good here... dry... Does not seem fresh... I've tried it 6 times now, always the same. I really can't comprehend the good reviews."}
{"text":"Food is not mind blowing memorable but very standard fair reasonably good Japanese restaurant. Nothing to complain about.  Parking, cleanliness, cozy seating and atmosphere make up for food not being mind blowing.  I would make this place a regular destination."}
{"text":"We watched the eye-catching flaming sushi boats sail past us as we debated whether to be seated around the spotlit sushi bar. After deciding to go with the ultra dim contemporary front dining area, my dinner date and I both noted how much more our surroundings felt like a shmancy seafood restaurant than a Japanese sushi bar.   Perhaps it was due to the decor, but we uncharacteristically both opted for something hot instead of sushi. While my chicken udon soup and his teriyaki steak on rice were both hearty and flavourful, I can hardly wait to come back to try one of those gorgeous looking boats."}
{"text":"Great authentic food , the best restaurant in Japanese food that I have ever had it's my favourite restaurant. I always get sashimi, it is always fresh, but everything is good there"}
{"text":"Got the number 8 bento lunch combo. Portion was good and everything was fresh. The miso soup was good and the salad dressing was tasty and not overpowering with a nice lemony taste. Lunch came quick which was nice. The tempura was also really good although I didn't like the zucchini that much. The only issue I had was that I felt the sashimi was cut a bit large so I split most of the pieces in 2, but they were still delicious. Overall value was great. Definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Japanese restos are a dime-a-dozen these days and sometimes it's hard not to write many of them off as bland since the food they serve all tends to taste the same and the service often leaves much to be desired...yawn.  Enter Momiji, a gem of a Japanese dining experience, nestled in the quaint confines of Royal York inside a handsome exposed brick building.  Upon entering Momiji my DC and I are greeted by a pleasant Asian fellow, then escorted to our table to later be serviced by an obliging Aussie fella, oh, how I love being served by men!  We order the Agedashi tofu which was the authentic kind, not the pussied out version you get served at your run of the mill Mcsushi place with tonkatsu sauce slathered over mushy fried tofu.  No, Momiji's agedashi tofu is bonafide with perfectly crisp edges, bathed in dashi broth with delightfully large bonito flakes sprinkled atop giving it that desireable fishy salted texture.    I have to say that like Dave Chapelle, I'm a huge fan of chicken http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SB8AozV1TD0&feature=related  and being the sushi/sashimi raw fish coward I am, I pretty much am limited to chicken dishes when I eat Japanese food and must declare that Momiji's Chicken teriyaki was the best I've had next to my mum's and that's saying a lot. The chicken was an excellent cut of white breast meat with no fat or gristle artfully laid on a bed of rice with steamed veggies that had a hint of buttery-ness to them, simply delicious.  Momiji's pricing is a bit higher than most but for the quality of the food, the service and the ambience it's well worth it, not to mention that it's away from the bustle of downtown.  If you'd like to escape from the usual humdrum  anti-climactic Japanese fare, then I suggest to give Momiji a try."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favourite sushi restaurants. It's a little pricey but the food is amazing! If you like salmon in sushi I highly recommend spicy chess roll which filled with spicy salmon and crispy tempura bits and topped with eel and avocado. I also recommend the blue mountain roll which is a larger plate of spicy salmon sushi and spicy salmon sashimi and tempura bits!"}
{"text":"Really fresh and the take-out (while a bit pricey) is worth it to get great food. If you're looking for ambience this is also a great venue: exposed brick, lit sushi conveyor belt down the centre of the room and a mix of booths, private tables, counter and regular tables. One of my favourite places in Bloor West/Kingsway."}
{"text":"I believe this is one of the best sushi places in Toronto. Prices are not too bad. Very good service and some really good sushi.  I would recommend this place to everyone. I have been here 4 or 5 times and it always is good. I have never had a bad experience at this one. Very nice atmosphere and great staff."}
{"text":"Large, clean space with great service. The lunch menu is awesome value. Free parking in a lot beside this place is rare in The Kingsway."}
{"text":"Not a bad sushi spot but perhaps a little overrated.  Indeed the atmosphere is great and the place is very nice indeed but I cannot say that the sushi was anything spectacular.  In fact, I thought the sushi itself was pretty average, nothing special.  The place is a bit more expensive than most sushi restaurants, but it does have a much nicer interior and atmosphere.  The service itself was fine, nothing to complain about there.  One thing that I found pretty cool is that they have the rotating belt in the middle which bring sushi around, something that I have only seen when I went to Asia.  Sadly, they only have it on at certain times and so chances are you probably will not get to experience it.  Anyways, I still go here pretty often because a lot of people seems to really like the place (and it is pretty nice), but the sushi itself is nothing special."}
