{"text":"After a night out in the bar, Donair Cite provides an unique experience late night. Being the only group there, we were quickly seated. Service was very friendly, and food came out fast. Offering a variety of donair meat options (donair, platter, pizza, and subs), I ordered the donair platter on onion rings. The donair meat and onion rings were good. The sauce, however, was too sweet for my liking, as I was expecting something more savoury. My friends enjoyed their meal overall. There is a stage where a band can play, but we were not so lucky. Check with the restaurant to see when a band is playing."}
{"text":"I am a Haligonian... I haven't been home for a visit and a Donair for a year now... I must say I enjoyed EVERY single bite of my Donair here tonight!!! I will be here every week now I'm sure :) thank you for the taste of home :)"}
{"text":"Finally, authentic East Coast donairs, garlic fingers, and all varieties of donair everything. Unique flavours you can't get anywhere else in Montreal. Best eaten during or post influence of alcohol, or on a lazy Sunday. SO GOOD."}
{"text":"I have never wrote a review of a restaurant online but I felt I had to for donair cite. Growing up in halifax and then moving to ottawa, toronto and montreal I have been on what had seemed to be a futile search for halifax donairs. I have encountered lots of \"meatloaf in oven\" style or even those blasphemers that open the pita \"pocket style\".  Donair cite is true to its roots. The meat is sliced thin and  piled high on a moistened pita and then coated in proper donair sauce. There is no lettuce, turnip, chickpeas or any of that hippy crap that seems to work in ontario. Just a bit of diced tomato and onion, this way the meat is the focal point. The staff were great and I recommend donair cite to everybody. Authentic in taste and price."}
{"text":"I came hungry and prepared for anything. As a Haligonian, I can attest that I was not disappointed! The meat is just like I remember it, an edible landscape of mystery meat spiced with the taste of heaven that is the strangely sweet donair sauce.  The giant Nova Scotia flag hanging by the entrance made me happy, and the friendly waitress wearing a kilt was an enjoyable bonus. The only suggestion is that the donair plate needs more cheese! LOAD THAT STUFF ON IT. Don't keep me from my cheese. Garlic fingers were perfect though."}
{"text":"We came in late at night and they still served us. The staff were extremely friendly and the food was delicious. This was my first time having a donair but i would definitely go back if only for the service"}
{"text":"Being a nova scotian myself, I can honestly say this place is as authentic as it gets. The donair sauce, the freshly thrown pie dough for the garlic fingers, and even the decor screams nova scotian with patriotic flags flying high. If your from ns and you wanna have a little taste of home or need something hearty after a hard night of boozin, look no further. All hail donair cite!"}
