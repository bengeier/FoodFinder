{"text":"Top chinois authentique. Service chaleureux et simple.   Des plats originaux et des ingrédients frais.  Demandez \"l'autre menu\" et voyez appar apparaître une panoplie de sélections typiques que les chinois aiment commander.   Nous y sommes des habitué et c'est génial."}
{"text":"Very northern style Chinese restaurant. Overall it is not bad but I am not a big fan of northern Chinese dishes."}
{"text":"This got to be my first and positive experience with a Chinese restaurant so far. Ever.  Check this out....  They say Chinese food is the most varied and tasteful food among the rest.  I have travelled many times to China and I can reassure you that this argument is really true as I have experienced all types of dishes from north to south from small villages to big modern cities.  And believe me the food on the other side of the world is incredible and has nothing to do with the altered food we have here or that I thought we have.....but today I finally found the only place that actually gives justice to real authentic Chinese food.   The flavours and usage of ingredients so close that I actually felt for a flash of a second that I was sitting at a local Chinese restaurant.   I have not yet been physically to the restaurant (I truly should have) but Oh man I enjoyed my food-  I placed and ordered the SHRIMP GENERAL TAO, the EGGPLANT POTATOES AND PEPPER, 2 LEEK PIES ABS THE PORK VERMICELLI STIR FRIED.   I am vegetarian so I only can tell you about the Vegetarian dishes and they were wonderful and well executed-  the spicy level was perfect to the dot - the Shrimp GT was a good alternative to the usual chicken you see everywhere and if you are looking for a change try this - you won't be disappointed-  but the CROWN GOES TO THE EGGPLANT AND POTATOES -  the dish is  coated with a special recipe that will leave you wanting more - all ingredients were cooked to a perfection -  Sounds like I'm doing a friend review but honestly they deserve it- I am a true satisfied customer and can't wait to go actually sit there and meet the super talented teammates whims this hidden gem.  Which by the way they are very polite and well spoken over the phone.  It was to a perfection that my FORTUNE COOKIE had a double fortune paper.  End of story, if you're desperately looking for a true authentic Chinese food-  search no longer this is it! HONG MÈRE deserves 5 Big   EN-"}
{"text":"It was good! We got the cabbage soup with white meat and stir-fried french beans with ground pork. Way too much food for two people. Next time we'll probably get an appetizer (leek pie??) and an entree.  As an American expat, Canadian-Chinese food just doesn't taste quite right to me--I'm apparently used to a slightly different grease-and-sugar blend. This place appears to serve both Chinese and \"Chinese\" food, so if you want something interesting but your companion demands General Tao, it might be worth a shot. Both menus appeared to have a large variety of choices.  Service was very friendly. Waiter was happy to answer questions about the menu. Ambiance was hole-in-the-wall, but why hold out for fancy tablecloths when you can have decent, cheap eats?"}
{"text":"Had some delivery issues due to the restaurant being busy, but after complaining the owner addressed the issue and delivery back to under an hour.  We have been clients for over 6 years and been mostly satisfied with the food as well made and fresh."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food take-out that I've tried in Montreal. Great taste and quick delivery. Food was warm and fresh."}
{"text":"Find Hong Mère on Yelp, it was a truly surprise! I wouldn't say it was perfect, but the dishes were fantastic comparing to the prices. Definitely I will repeat and recommend."}
{"text":"A solid 4 maybe even a 5 once I explore more items on the menu.  After Looking through menus on top of menus of mediocre meh local Asian cuisine we decided to turn to the internet for some help. This place had crazy good reviews so we gave it a go. We ordered take out which was perfect and ready in 30 minutes.  Location is a little hole in the wall but a true gem for Verdun. The restaurant was crawling with young adults and half of them were Asian so you know it's gotta be good because from my previous experience when there's lots of Asian families and young teens it's usually a good indication it's going to be super tasty and this place was nothing but pure perfection!   Started off with the large won ton soup as I'm sick and was craving a simple soup. There was 12 dumplings which I won't argue with because who doesn't want more ? Broth was good not watery and bland. Green onions were fresh. Peanut butter dumplings were killer. The sauce has a tad of spice you won't notice it but it brings out the flavours. Each dumplings was evenly coated with a rich creamy peanut butter sauce. The pork was great it came with about 5 thinly coated sweet and sour pork chops with well seasoned veggies on the side and a little Bowl of rice not to much so it sits in your fridge for 3 days.  Loved this place I would recommend trying this place next time you're in the area or before you call your local Resto."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I should even bother taking the time to write a review since yelp NEVER recommends my reviews but nonetheless, let's see what happens.  I ordered from here tonight and the delivery was quite fast.  Their menu is extensive and there is a lot to choose from.  I ordered the green beans with ground pork which was delicious, the special fried rice which honestly was quite possibly the best chinese rice I've ever had, the leek pancake which was quite good, the wonton soup and the salt and pepper tofu.    I feel that I should elaborate on the pros and cons of the salt and pepper tofu and the wonton soup.  First of all, the salt and pepper tofu was really quite flavourful, the problem is that they use plastic containers to pack their food and anything fried should not be packed in plastic because it loses it's crispiness.  It's the second time I order something crispy from this restaurant and it arrives not as crispy as it should be but I can tell that it was nice and crispy when they packed it.  I'm going to have to either remember to only eat their crispy foods in person at the restaurant or ask for a different kind of packaging.  As for the wonton soup, their wontons were yummy and the broth was fantastic, the problem with the wonton soup is that it is supposed to be a large meal sized soup for $8.50 and I felt like for that price I should have gotten more than 9 wontons, the rest of the container was packed with some kind of noodle.  Their small sized soups only cost $2.50 and if you order dumpling (which are basically the same thing as the wonton) you get 18 for $9.99 so I just don't thing that the $8.50 I paid was good value compared to the other items on the menu.  It left me wondering if I might of gotten more wontons if I had ordered 3 small sized wonton soups for $7.50.  One other thing I think I should mention although, they may have now resolved this issue or maybe not, if you order over the phone it can be quite difficult to get your order across since they have several different menus.  I don't even bother ordering over the phone anymore, I just order online so there are no issues with having to explain what it is I want to order.  All in all, the food is really quite good!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has no name.....it's a little bite difficult to find....the decoration looks weird...and no style...the food was ok,but we're waiting too long for de food...but looks like they are very busy to do the delivery ...maybe I'll be back again for take way..."}
{"text":"It is seriously one of the best chinese restaurant in Montreal, really authentic almost like home made food. I was really surprised that they use fresh ingredients. I ordered cabbage and pork dumplings and i saw them literally take out the cabage from their fridge outside the kitchen to make the dumpling on site, so im sure that they are freshly made. The size of the dumplings are also super huge, it is almost twice as big as dumplings found in other restaurant.  They also have a lot of choices on their menu that are not easily found in other chinese restaurants.  The lady whi owns the restaurant is super friendly and often comes to the tables to chat with the clients.  Planning on coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"I loved the food that my husband and I ordered from the big menu. There are mostly Szechaun food but for our kids we ordered from the takeout menu. Seems like American/ Canadian typical takeout Chinese food. The stir-fried udon was good but the salted and pepper deep-fried pork shop is not what we always have in our home area. More like tempura pork chop but no bread crumbs...very puffy and super thin slice of pork in the middle.  I had to ask for a new plate because the one I had was obviously oily and our table was facing to the restroom...not that great, right? :-)  I would prefer buy takeout and eat at home for better view but dining there is fine. Better stick with the big menu."}
{"text":"Cut above most Chinese restos. And the advice is right, order off the full menu. Immediate service. Only criticism was that the pork diah we had was very salty. But, the quality and quantity were both very good. Will def be returning (but might ask for a little less salt!). Great addition to the Verdun dining scene."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal here with my coworkers. Food came out quickly and was hit and super delicious. Not much decor or style here and seriously for me it's all about the food and service and both were very good.   Parking is metered so be careful! I will be back here for more!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple days ago not expecting much but the food was really flavourful! However, the food is a bit greasy, especially having it as leftover the next day. But otherwise, the food was really homey and authentic. We had food off the Chinese menu such as the eggplant, dumplings, stir-fried beans with shredded potato, \"la pi\" and a chive and egg \"large dumpling\". The meat sandwich \"rou jia mou\" was a bit dry though. But definitely going back! Random hole in the wall location, my favorite finds."}
