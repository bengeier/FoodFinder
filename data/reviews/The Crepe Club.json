{"text":"This was my first visit to the Biltmore location with a friend.  Beautiful environment, excellent food & service, and good prices.  Very friendly owners and workers.  I will return."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the service was horrible and I was only there to pick up an order... it took me 15mins to get there,but the order had not been started prior to my arrival, so I waited inside for another 15mins. when my order was ready, the staff person slid me the stack of containers and asked if I needed a bag. I said \"please\".. they gave me a bag to bag it myself. -_-"}
{"text":"Amazing food and quality service, this is probably the best crepe place ever!   If you are looking for a great crepe place I recommend this restaurant, the service is amazing and very friendly!"}
{"text":"If you know and love crepes this is NOT the place to go.  Went there for lunch and ordered a traditional chicken florentine crepe.  The crepe itself was not the delicate, thin crepe popularized by the French.  My crepe was large and thick resembling a pancake more than a crepe.  The chunks of chicken and globs of spinach also lacked the delicacy and refinement of a French crepe.  And lastly, the Béchamel sauce, the little there was, did not even begin to resemble a legitimate Béchamel.  I was not expecting fine French food but I was expecting food that at least closely resembled what it purported to be.  If you close to go, go with low expectations and you won't be as disappointed as I was."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Super nice staff, absolutely delicious food. I feel like this place will undo any good i do at my nearby yoga studio.    We had a quiche lorraine,  strawberry short crepe,  and a nutella smores crepe.    The quiche is SO good.  Savory and flavorful with a delicious flaky crust.  The bacon had great flavor,  egg and cheese portion delightfully fluffy. It had a tasty little salad alongside of mixed greens.  The strawberry short crepe was fluffy and the perfect thickness.  Strawberry,  biscoff crumbles, whipped cream, and crepe. Delicious!   The Nutella S'mores crepe was simply decadent. Nutella,  marshmallow, and biscoff crumbles filled and adorned this crepe. I didn't get a picture because it was too tempting.   I also got a chocolate mousse to go home.   All in all a wonderful experience, especially thanks to the two nice young gents workong thia evening. We will definitely be back! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing.  I stumbled upon this place about 2 weeks ago. The shop is simple and quaint, which does not reflect upon the organic magnitude of its taste.   The menu is laid out on the wall behind the register, offering panini, sandwiches, sweet crepes, savory crepes, and salads. When I first entered, I was a little indecisive. The two gentlemen behind the counter were incredibly nice & extremely helpful in describing some of their products, and what would best suit my taste. Being a panini and Nutella aficionado, the offered options were well-fitted and bore strong expectations.   I first chose the Rosemary Chicken Panini; it was amazing. I've tried many sandwich establishments in Arizona- and have had a difficult time finding a sandwich to meet my East Coast standards- but this panini was fantastic and truly exceeded my expectations. It was the perfect combination of flavour, in conjunction with the perfect toast to the bread (I believe their bread is also made in-house daily?).  It was absolutely amazing, nonetheless, and it was enough to make this my go-to spot for sandwiches during my duration in Arizona.   When I returned again, I decided to pursue my staple food item this time: Nutella Crepes. I don't know how to describe the taste sans ostentation. The nutella crepe was absolutely amazing. It was perfectly warm and perfectly sweet. Every ingredient's presence was perfect in its attendance; it was not overloaded or overbearing with sweetness. Every bit of it was well-rounded in delivering that perfect bite, every time. I have been to France quite a number of times, and have to say that these pastries come up infinitesimally close to the perfection of France's pastries.  There is a fridge that offers some fresh-pressed juices, to-go salads, etc. that I did not have an opportunity to try, but am sure are excellent if they match up to the experience that I've had thus far.  If you are looking for a new spot for juices, a sandwich/salad lunch spot, or a place to end your night with dessert, I would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great experience. If you're looking for a quick bite, or want to have an afternoon snack, the Crepe Club is a perfect spot!"}
{"text":"The crepes were so mediocre for the total price of two of them was absolutely terrible. Both crepes were burnt. The ingredients  were either sloppily placed in the middle as if they didn't care at all about what they were doing, Or they were cold, minimal, and just all around unpleasing. I will never go back that is for certain."}
{"text":"Best crepes I have ever had.  Julia was the best!!! The service was the best. The quality of the food was super. Everything was fresh and the server Julia will make us want to come back."}
{"text":"I waited with my dad for about 20 minutes for two crepes. We were expecting yummy crepes since that is what they are known for and they were dry with no flavor. Definetely will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I have been here twice and the service has been great. Crepes, both sweet and savory, as well as Paninis and salads are all really good."}
{"text":"Wonderful French employee helped us gracefully. He is a charmer! Great food, great macarons, love the decor and chandelier! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I came across the Crepe Club while shopping in the area. The crepes were delicious and the service was super friendly. I had the Chicken Avocado Crepe and it was full of flavor. I think the chicken had rosemary,  whatever it was it was good! We also tried a Nutella Crepe. It was the perfect balance of crepe and nutella. Not overly sweet, just right. I'm glad we found this place, we'll be returning."}
{"text":"Finally was able to make it and eat some crepes!!!! Before I go and try a new place, I read reviews made by customers... I don't know why this place does not have a five star.... This place has a very relaxing atmosphere and the food is really tasty and good.  I was told that they make the dressings and you can actually taste it.  Staff is very courteous & knowledgeable of what they have.  Place is adorable, classy, and very charming! Also you know this place is kept clean, event their bathroom is adorable and tidy!  I was hesitant at first since I read some reviews that wasn't that good; but, after trying this place, those complaints don't do this place justice... Some of the reviews complain about cold food-- wow, food gets cold so fast, think about these thinly spread crepes-- the place has an ambiance that you tend to stray away from eating your food and instead talk... then you get back to it and its no longer hot as how you like it... Well , it happened to me-- but I still enjoyed the taste of it.  Why blame the restaurant for it.  Some reviews that were made for deliveries are ridiculous-- if you want to enjoy freshly made food that would stay hot, go visit their place and instead of waiting for delivery places to bring them to you.... Now, going back to the main topic of food!!!! I got their Chicken Florentine, and my gosh, that was really tasty... My friend ordered the Rosemary Chicken Panini-- oh boy are you going to get full, this comes in four pieces with a little side of greens... The dressing is really addicting, my friend had to ask for more... I had to take one of those pieces from my friend and that really tasted good...The server said that it has Garlic sun dried tomato aioli in it............... Sweet crepes for dessert-- I tried the apple that is being offered for a limited time... Oh, was that good.. apples, cinnamon, & crumbles... really, really , really good... I just shared it with my friend since she was so full from her paninis... There it is folks--- a nice place to enjoy a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Me & my family just stumbled upon this little place at San Tan Mall.   We were so surprised that they had a crepe place around the Gilbert area.   The food is freshly made in front of you.  The crepes were delicious, my wife had a Mediterranean Chicken which was bomb!!!! I had a Chicken Florentine which was also so good, and my daughter had their Salmon Croissant which she said was amazing with their buttery croissant. Staff was so nice and very accommodating and informative.    I hope they had more signs to show where they are located.  If I had known that they have been there since Christmas, I would have visited this place often. They are just so tucked in a place that you won't even notice."}
{"text":"Located in the Biltmore Fashion Park, great crepes, quite a few to choose from, had the Nutella smores one, really good, nice little place."}
{"text":"Great new spot at BFP.  I admit to some initial skepticism due to the Euro-fanciness of the place, but they carry some surprisingly hearty options (e.g., sausage and egg crepe, as well as the occasionally-available \"sausage and bis-crepes\").  The coffee is also excellent.  Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Yum! I had the Nutella with whip cream... The crepe was super light and airy and they were close to closing so they gave me a fresh juice called the hangover fix... Really fresh and slightly sweet very refreshing... I had a need for something sweet after dinner and shopping at the biltmore.. This place was really good. And if you enjoy really good service I think this place might really impress you.  Thank you to the 2 really nice guys working tonight... Cyndee"}
{"text":"One star off for not having full outdoor service. It is still counter service but they will bring it out to you. The crepes are very good, I like the egg and sausage. Fresh illy coffee is nice too"}
{"text":"While visiting the Biltmore we found the Cafe and decided to have a snack. We chose the vegetarian crepe. As it was early the service and food was quick and friendly. The host chatted with us and told how they expanded from a food cart to stand alone eateries. The crepe was tasty and warm. All the ingredients seemed fresh. Also the vanilla white cake was light, airy and tasty. We plan to return for breakfast sometime soon. Support a local business."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! They ran out of paninnis so Maria made my husband a beautiful sandwich that was pressed like a pannini, but it was made out off crate instead. Absolutely the best!!!! 5 stars.. The staff is also amazing! Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place! So gorgeously decorated reminding me of Europe. Perfect spot to take the girlie-girl in your life. Breakfast with a coffee and chocolate croissant would be pure perfection. Seriously though, reminds me of Paris. The food was so delicious. My husband and I split the Mediterranean Chicken Crepe. It was savory from the tender grilled chicken, cheesy from the mozzarella with a finish of tartness and freshness from the sundried tomato aioli. A must try.   My dessert (I got the large) was the Strawberry \"short-Crepe\" not surprisingly, I ate the entire thing! So creamy with the whipped cream, tart from the berries and sweet from the crumbled Biscoff cookie. Once again, the Crepe was tender and delicate. Yum, yum, yum! We went in for lunch so I didn't have coffee or the chocolate croissant but, I will most definitely be back for that! Coffee date anyone?"}
{"text":"I was here for the first time almost a month ago. I honestly expected better. The service was good along with the strawberry crepe I ordered but I've had more delicious crepes at Elevate Coffee Company and it's a little pricey too (paid $17 for 2 small crepes & 2 water bottles). The seating was also really dirty. There were stains all over. I do like the décor though and crepes overall so I'll probably be back. It's a chill place to hangout with a friend or whomever."}
{"text":"Love , love love this place !  First of all the place itself is very quaint & charming!  After being in paris several times its truly authentic !  The food is delicious & the owner is extremely personable ! There is just enough of a selection to chose from. It is a wonderful place  for lunch or dessert after a busy day of shopping !! My husband & I stopped in after shopping at Saks 5th avenue on Sunday August 4th. It's our second visit for lunch & will certainly be back.  The food is \"oh so french\". I can't say enough about this pace!   Mmmmm !"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this new convenient and delicious restaurant! Tried the rosemary chicken panini, the go green juice and the delectable hazelnut mousse cake and I cannot speak highly enough about each of these! Looking forward to trying there many other options including the sweet as well as savory crepes. Such a gem and such an ideal location!"}
{"text":"Incredible service and the crepes are simply divine  Highly recommend it to satisfy your sweet or savory cravings!"}
{"text":"This place is SO cute!!! Full of friendly,hardworking staff and the food is amazing!!!! We couldn't decide what to get so we ordered mini ones to try. Delicious!!! We are coming back real soon!!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a couple quick crepes here - chicken florentine and nutella. Great decor and service."}
{"text":"I have been searching for a place to get good crepes in the valley for years.  We have tried many places with high Yelp ratings and although they are good, they just aren't as good as the ones I've had at Paris in Las Vegas or the Frenchman with a crepe stand at the base of the Telluride ski resort in Colorado.  Finally, we have found THE BEST CREPE place in Phoenix!   We drove 45 minutes in from Chandler and would love to see a Crepe Club open at or near Chandler Fashion/Downtown Chandler....pretty please :).  Manager is wonderful and very friendly.  Only 2 comments for improvement is to replace the cloth booth seats with leather or vinyl so they don't stain and fill the fruit crepes with just a tad more fruit.  Chicken Florentine crepe, strawberry short crepe and my daughter's biscoff amd nutella waffle were mouth watering.  Service was fast and there was a steady stream of people coming in the entire time we were there on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"My wife took me here last night for my first time and her second. The establishment was filled with middle eastern folks so it must be good right? We placed our order and then waited for about 20 minutes to get it. We stood in the back of the place waiting and then finally moved outside to watch as the young man made the crepes. As we were sitting I noticed a female employee who was. Asking drinks and delivering orders inside and out of the place, with no hair net or hat to hold her long hair back. She constantly moved her hair back with her hands  and or would touch her face and then go back to what she was doing. Never wore gloves nor washed her hands after touching her face or hair or even when she would go in and out of the front door, grabbing the handle. Occasionally she would wipe her fingers on a white towel but gross.   I'm not so sure this is a place I would want to come back to until she reapplies for a food handlers card."}
{"text":"First time here and already in love with their acai bowl! The ppl are super nice and helpful here. It's a nice place to sit and read a book or talk to friends. And ambience is casual. I come here occasionally to study or do a couple things for school. All in all, it's definitely worth checking out!!"}
{"text":"They DO make the crepes here... just saying cause someone else said they didn't.  Friggin good! Will be back for sure. Egg and sausage crepe was fantastic! Good scene! Love the decorations"}
{"text":"Cute little place! Got here around 7pm, about an hour before closing. Bf wanted something off of the Savory Crepes menu, but we were told they weren't serving any Savory Crepes at this time.. not sure if they ran out of ingredients or they just stop serving them at a certain time. We got the Smores crepes instead & it was delicious. It was packed with a Ton of nutella."}
{"text":"Best crepes in the west coast... This place is Amazing and has really healthy options that makes it even more awesome. The guys that run the show are also amazing! Definitely recommend the chicken florentine crepe extremely yummy!! For fresh juices I recommend the hang over, super good"}
{"text":"Bleh...the girl cooking the crepes was not good. Like other reviews the strawberry crepe came out doughy and raw tasting. No crispness at all. I ordered a banana nutella, wasn't even warm. Banana was cold and no \"melty\" nutella. This place will go down vv the tubes auper quick. They need a true crepe chef or else. Not good"}
{"text":"The crepes were great and at a convenient location. My husband and I have been looking for a great crepe place since our last favorite closed down and after being here, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love crepes and I love supporting local business, I was so excited to give this place a go.  I arrived and was promptly provided assistance by Conner who was behind the counter. I ordered the turkey pesto and the strawberry shortcake both half portions.  Both of them were VERY good, I really enjoyed the graham cracker crumbles on the strawberry crepe and the fact that there wasn't an excessive amount of whipped cream. Downside was the half portions weren't that filling, I ordered them as such because of experience at a different crepery but that was my fault.   The reason this isn't a five star is because of the conversations I witnessed while there. I brought my work with me to get out of the hotel room and have a different scenery so I was there for over two hours. The below was largely witnessed in the first 20 min however.  What did bother me was listening to two of the employees speak to who I'm assuming was one of the partners, because of the way he spoke, regarding their distaste for the other partner in terms that included an excessive amount of profanity from Conner. There was other conversation such as what they were doing at their other job, how they disliked so and so, etc.    No matter my profession I would find this distasteful. It is a small dining area and I was sitting maybe 10 feet from the counter so no matter your voice level I'm going to hear you. Business concerns, employee concerns should never be talked about in front of customers especially for a start up such as this that is trying to \"make it\". Get serious people"}
{"text":"Exceptional service! I tried the regular size chicken florentine crepe with a traditional unsweetened ice tea. The crepe was loaded and the ingredients complemented each other really well. I was happy that it wasn't salty as some other crepe places are. The portion was large and I had to pack what I couldn't finish. The tea was my favorite. It wasn't overwhelming or bitter; I didn't even put sugar! The hot weather made it the cold tea taste even better. Maria, one of the ladies who looked like she was in charge, was very kind!    The location on campus is very accessible, sitting right outside noble library,  the engineering center,  and within close proximity to palm walk. Before it was The Crepe Club it was a subpar coffee place and I'm truly glad that it's changed. In short, I would spend $10 here for quality food than the overpriced mediocre food in the memorial union."}
{"text":"Very cute restaurant, decor is modern elegant, great looking pastries you order at the counter than find a table (I usually don't like that concept I feel like I'm ordering at a fast food restaurant but not here) I had the chicken florentine crepe, coffee and fresh orange juice (only complaint) I was expecting fresh squeezed but I got a bottle of orange juice from I assume some designer orange juice company I think it was close to $5 it was good but I don't  like drinking fresh OJ out of a bottle.  They have a very open beverage bar in the back which I loved! You can make your coffee how and as often as you want it along with ice cold water (regular/lemon and I think cucumber.  I drink a lot of water and sometimes it's a process to get a refill.  I learned fast that helping myself was convenient.  Besides the beverage bar it reminded me of a creperie I was at a few months ago in Tournon.  Not a full service restaurant but I will be back.  Lots more I want to try I'll keep you updated....."}
{"text":"i got the first to write a review on crepes on campus!?!?  asu has been needing a cart like thjs for years. so many choices of crepes to choose from. not only that they have freshly squeezed juices as well. and ICED coffee.  the staff is so friendly. and fast. there might be a line. (could be fOr the fresh pastries) .but they get in and out fast"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we'll definitely be back. I read other reviews that said the crepes are thick and tasteless. They are thick, but they are delicious. My teenage son is a crepe aficionado and absolutely loved his strawberry crepe, his chocolate croissant, and his mint lemonade (which he saw them making right there). My turkey, cheese and tomato crepe was very filling with just the right balance of everything.  We sat on the front patio and met the owner who was very gracious and genuinely cared how we liked our meal.  The guys behind the counter who cooked and served were really nice.  While we were there we saw lots of people come in for the juices so we'll have to try some on our next trip."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i went for a late brunch and had a fantastic meal  The crepes were very tasty and brought back memories of Paris, the crepes are freshly made and o so oooygooy, and so filling many options to choose from and each one as delicious as the next , yummy  oso scrumptious"}
{"text":"Found it on Yelp while visiting Phoenix.  Fantastic staff. The location is at a beautiful mall, and we couldn't find it. Called the restaurant, and the young lady came outside to wave us in.  Healthy choices, and sweet choices. All made to order. Eat inside, or out in the Court yard.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"I have to give a big shout out to Karim! These crepes are phenomenal!!! Thank you for bringing such beautiful  and decadent crepes to this side of the valley! I was impressed with the ambience, selections and  especially how I was treated being my first time there.  I will be making frequent visits to this lovely place"}
{"text":"We have been ordering from The Crepe Club for months!  Their food is THAT delicious and fresh!  We crave their crepes, sandwiches, salads and desserts.  Great place for fresh and YUMMY food!"}
{"text":"I found a new favorite, mouth watering crepes here in Phoenix. The ambiance is classy and the staff are fabulous.Maria was amazing recommending yumminesss in my life I had the Smores nutella and biscoff cookie with strawberries, so delish, they're very generous with the nutella so let them know on how you want it. I wish they have the crepe club in Scottsdale Az,"}
{"text":"Ufff!!! I just had a nutella crepe, and it was delicious!!!! A watermelon juice to Die for ! If you like watermelon lol. And a coffee , I loved it I felt like I was in Europe for 15 minutes  and the guys were so nice and welcoming! Just one of those places you get good vibes and it's just uplifting I loved it defenatly going back!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant and with a very vintage appearance. The crepes were a little bland and cold when I got them. I would go back to give it a second shot. Other than that, really cute and classy place."}
{"text":"Had  awesome service by Taylor and Lexi and the Crepes were amazing! The restaurant was clean and inviting."}
{"text":"RUDE!!!! I placed an order through Postmates on 2 separate occasions and they were rude to the driver, messed up my order, and said they didn't have baguette available when it's what ALL their sandwiches are made of! That's like saying they don't have crepes!"}
{"text":"Solid crepes, they seem like they're still settling in to their new space. I'm sure this will be one of the best Crêpe spots in town though!"}
{"text":"Visited The Crepe Cafe on 5/26/17 in the Arizona Biltmore area. The crepe was delicious, staff was friendly and professional and restaurant was clean. I ordered food at the counter and was served in 10 minutes. This would be a great location if you were in a hurry. Love the whole Crepe Cafe concept. I would definitely return and recommend to others. I will also try the other locations. General Manager and Owner both spoke to me. They genuinely acted like they cared about their customers. Great customer experience at this location."}
{"text":"I normally don't leave a review this low or long, (especially not typing on a phone) but I just received the most offensive sandwich ever from here. I've been here once before and ordered the turkey sausage, egg and avocado croissant. I have a doctor in that area that I have to see so it's the most convenient place to stop by after the appointment bc I have to fast leading up to the appt. so clearly I'm hungry... oh and I'm 6 months pregnant. So today, I have this appt where I've fasted and now I need to grab a sandwich before another appt... I order the same croissant as last time, which I should note doesn't taste super flavorful or amazing but they are nice and it's close. Problem is, there's no close parking... but I'm in a good mood so I waddle my pregnant self the 5 minute walk to the restaurant.   It's completely dead inside. Me and one other couple. The cashier notes that it's been slow all morning. I order the same egg, turkey sausage and avocado croissant and add a mini crepe to finally taste what they are known for. It's ready in about 3 minutes which was my first point of concern. I waddle back out to my car and start to open my food to eat bc I have to drive to my next appt. Yall... this croissant.... was embarrassing. 1. It was completely missing eggs. Not a single egg. 2. There was like 2 pieces of ripped apart turkey sausage that looked dry and like a rat had been chewing on it. 3. Mushy tomatoes which fell out as soon as I picked up the eggless empty sandwich and got all over my paperwork from the doctor. 4. Some unmelted shredded cheese and some sad lettuce.  Honestly, I didn't take a picture bc now my pregnant self had to waddle back to the store to return this mess and still make my next appt. on time. Part of me wishes I had so the owner could see the type of food being put out when the restaurant is DEAD ASS slow.   I wouldn't have even written this had it been a crazy busy Saturday morning and I'd received an otherwise edible looking sandwich with appetizing looking turkey sausage and fixings and in their haste the eggs were somehow left off the EGG sandwich. But again, it was empty and I got a sandwich that looked like I had inconvenienced the staff by even ordering it. Ugh. I digress but I won't be eating there again bc that sausage looked old as ever and maybe the eggs just hid it last time The cashier gave me my refund but really no excuse although he looked at that sandwich and looked super embarrassed. There was really nothing for anyone to say. I just got my refund and left.  As an update... I reached out to the manager as he requested below and apparently his response was just for show on Yelp bc he never responded"}
{"text":"This a great find! Went here for Mother's Day and my crepe was free bc I was a mom; talk about customer service.  The waitstaff came around frequently to check on us, and the food was really good too.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had really high hopes for this place after looking on their website. My hopes were somewhat dashed when I found out they are located in the mall, like a food court shop and didn't look anything like the online photos. The staff was friendly but the crepes are just ok."}
{"text":"Very cute, but my quiche was cold.  Sent it back to the kitchen and it came back 15 minutes later without the salad it came with and still not hot!  My friend had a salmon wrap and it was good.  Will try again and order a crepe which is made at the front, and hopefully is warm!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and flavorful food! First time here. The regualr size Mediterranean Chicken.  It was so tasty and full of flavor. Not heavy either. I also had the regular S'Mores Nutella. It was very tasty but also VERY sweet. It ended be too much chocolate, so I had to take 1/2 home. I would do the mini next time or get a fruity one instead. AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"Came here today for National Crepe Day to receive my free Nutella Crepe! It's in the Biltmore Fashion Square so you'll have to park and ask for validation at the cafe to circumvent the charges you would otherwise receive for parking. Also, the shop is inside of the complex, not along the parking area.  The Nutella Crepe was good and pretty large for their \"small\", I felt sated after only one! The employees were very friendly and the cafe is gorgeous, white marble throughout! Right outside of the cafe is a large chess game, the pieces are about 2-3 ft tall, really neat."}
{"text":"I have always thought of crepes as the breakfast food that was hidden on the menu that no one was sure what it was... then I had crepe club! I am hooked! Crepes will be my new go to food! Crepe club has savory and sweet crepes both melt in your mouth!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are crepe feigns! We haven't found a great crepe out here in Phoenix but this place is pretty good! We had a chicken crepe and it was very tasty! The cream I think it's béchamel adds a nice flavor to it making it creamy and delightful without being too heavy. The Nutella strawberry crepe was amazingly light and fluffy, which it is not usual to do with Nutella but we loved it. We will be back!"}
{"text":"TL;DR: DO NOT GO HERE. Place is a dump. Juice place tried to pivot into Crepes, place still blows.  There's a problem in general with the entire area of Biltmore Fashion that they've dubbed \"The Union\".  It's a fucking dump.  Let's talk about mall real estate for just one sec: It's the most overpriced lease a retailer can hope for.  Then some genius at Biltmore decided to start some shit concept where they could charge slightly less on rent to attract weird hipster concept businesses and they could have fake walls and only kind of exist. Like in the same way you may be able to consider a cubicle a \"room\". Boom! The Crepe Club was born (not exactly, it was some other juice place, and it still is that same place but they pivoted out of desperation and started serving crepes in addition to Juice and random food items that are mostly bad.  The union was a DEAD ZONE. It's Saturday. Add that shit up.  Fun fucked up facts about Crepe Club: - a laptop was setup on one of the few places there was to sit in this box, (assuming one of the employees no one else was in here) - Everything served on paper plates, plastic silverware and....brown paper towels as napkins WTF. - Surfaces were dusty as fuck, like they just reopened after 3 months of sitting - Random wholesale container of generic salsa that should be in a refrigerator is sitting on one table...just sitting there..for how long no one knows. No one here cares they're just standing around like it's their first day. - AM I IN A BUSINESS RIGHT NOW, OR IS THIS A VERY WELL DONE BAKE SALE? - There's just a lot of random shit everywhere, I'm probably getting food poisoning as nothing I'm seeing points to \"we handle food safety\" or \"fresh\" in general.  At some point you need to decide if you're competing with Wendy's, or Seasons 52 next door.  Marketing yourself as one, and presenting yourself as less than the other = high expectations that can't be met, especially given paper plates and plastic forks. Oh that's right, you can't have a dishwasher or a real kitchen because you exist in the fucking \"Union\"  You don't really need to know about the food except that it took them ~15 minutes to make it, should have taken 3, and it sucked. I paid $30 for 2 people to eat and I'm still hungry. It was a Caesar salad, Panini, and Crepe.  I got exponentially more joy from a garbage meal I had at Taco Bell for $5 earlier. I could have made all at home and made them better.  Why is this place still in business. Don't worry it can't survive the summer.  If you're thinking about going here, contact me immediately and I'll gladly talk you out of it free of charge."}
{"text":"Don't go here for the gelato!  We were a little early for a movie and thought we'd have some gelato for a treat. I got maybe a scoop and a half in my bowl... I ordered the small, but come on!"}
{"text":"Great Nutella French toast and Nutella mini Crepe Anything with Nutella would be great to try and good service too,  Thanks"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here about a month ago during the middle of the week and were blown away. The owner or manager was there and it was pretty slow so our service was amazing. We had a savory, 2 mini sweet crepes and coffee that were to die for. The atmosphere and and food was incredible. We were every excited to come back and brought my boyfriends mom today to try it. They weren't that busy but the food took a while. We had a savory crepe each. The crepes didn't have quite the same texture as before and weren't as good. The coffee tasted very different so we asked and they said they got the coffee across the street for days they are busy instead of making it on their coffee machine because it takes too long. 1/4 of the tables were empty and there was only one other person in line behind us. They also had ran out of their dulche de Leche which we loved last time so that was pretty disappointing. Overall, you can tell the owner or manager demands high quality when he is there but when not, the experience is pretty average."}
{"text":"I got a dessert crepe and a savory crepe and both were overcooked and cracker like in consistency. They remade the dessert crepe for me, but I have had much better crepes elsewhere. The interior was nice but felt like a knock off, with paint chipped off some of the styrofoam ball ornaments."}
{"text":"Great Crêpe, very creative. Best is the vanilla bean crepe. Marinated strawberry is not too sweet, not sour, just perfect. The price is a little too high. Nice atmosphere. I'm surprised they take reservations"}
{"text":"Love this cute little crepe spot! Went last night for dessert with my cousin and husband. Not busy at all for a Saturday night at 7pm.  Decor and ambiance is fun and trendy. Staff was friendly.  And yes, the crepes were yummy! A little pricey but it's the Biltmore. So it's a perfect spot for a dessert stop.  The breakfast sounds delicious so we might have to try it for breakfast. It's a nice addition to the neighborhood and who doesn't love crepes! The sweet cherry on top that pushed me to the 5th star? We shut the place down, and the staff gave us the left over croissants! Yum!  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Just had crepe club delivered by postmates and holy moley, it was delicious!!! I enjoyed the turkey, Swiss and tomato savory crepe for lunch today and will definitely order again! Reminds me of how my French grandmother's crepes taste!"}
{"text":"Great food and I don't have to wait long for my food!! all though it would be better if the main register girl with glasses wouldn't constantly talk shit about other employees. It's constantly."}
{"text":"When I came to eat here they informed me I lost my sunglasses there the previous visit, and when I asked to have them, they had no clue where they were and told me they think one of the employees or manager took them home with them because it had been too long. It was two weeks prior... I will never come back."}
{"text":"I was very excited to hear about the opening of Crepe Club - I do love a good crepe! And so close to home was a huge bonus! I invited a friend to join me for a belated birthday brunch, and was truly looking forward to a nice brunch. I hadn't realized it was part of the Union shops at Biltmore - I had envisioned an actual restaurant. We were lucky to be the first ones there - as we were able to get one of the three tables they have outside.  For our food selections, we decided to share two savory crepes (the chicken Florentine and the turkey/Swiss) and one sweet for dessert (Nutella and strawberry). I requested a large coffee and water to drink. I truly appreciate they do everything fresh in house, daily. However, when the birthday boy was placing his drink order, they were unable to provide his first two requests (lemonade and iced tea), as they weren't made yet. He settled for a large coffee. At the register, I had to remind the employee of the dessert crepe (which struck me as odd, as I asked him which his favorite was, and agreed to go with that - of the three crepes - that was the one HE chose.) We sat outside and waited for the food. The turkey and Swiss came first - the chicken Florentine about 5 minutes later. Both were okay, as far as the fillings went, but the crepe itself was not what I'd envisioned. In my experience, the crepe batter should be mostly egg, with some batter. This was more like a watery pancake batter with some egg - and was definitely on the sweet side. That flavor was fine for the sweet crepe, but didn't entirely work with the savory ones. Also, it wasn't as delicate (possibly cooked too long? Possibly too much of the batter:egg ratio?) as it should have been. For lack of a better description, it seemed to be closer to quesadilla than crepe. The coffee apparently is made in a machine that is supposed to automatically add cream. \"Luckily\", they forgot to add the cream in the machine, so we were first given black coffee. The birthday boy drinks his coffee black, so the mistake was the only reason he got the right thing. (Very good to know - it would have been quite the let down if he was told he couldn't have any of his first three choices - and who know black coffee would have to be a special request.) When the coffee was brought out, I (again) requested a water. Asked twice, never received. The devil's in the details - and if everything else was absolutely perfect, I likely would have let that go - but there were enough missteps both in food and service that the lack of water just added to the list. The fillings in each of the crepes were fine, and what was expected. There was nothing bad in what we ate - but nothing that made either of us WOW, and no reason either of us will be pushing to go back again. It wouldn't take much to add an extra star - and I am sure some of this is just new business kinks that will work themselves out - but for now, when I need a crepe fix, I will look elsewhere. (I know of at least two other places in town doing them right.)"}
{"text":"The Crepe Club was a fabulous experience. We had the strawberry crepe and it was great. The staff loved our daughters and were so friendly, playing with them and giving them samples. The manager then came out and gave them the croissant they were going nuts over and said he loved their smiles and had to give them the pastry. It was genuinely thoughtful and he seemed so happy to make our girls day. I definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the mood for some crepes!"}
{"text":"Hiring their catering services was the best thing we did at our event! It was a fun and different experience were all our guests enjoyed the fresh crepes and the server was so nice and having small chats with everyone creating a fun atmosphere. They did the setup with minimal intrusion.  Love the place, love their crepes and totally recommend it!"}
{"text":"When I went to ASU back in the day, there was mostly fast food on campus. It's nice to see some delicious eats coming to campus. I love the story of this place about three brothers coming from Syria to attend ASU. They got their degrees and then started up a crepe cart on campus. It became so popular that they recently opened their own restaurant at the Biltmore. Now they have opened up this permanent location right next to Old Main. I got two mini crepes so I could try both a sweet and savory one. The creme de lemon was nice and warm and I enjoyed the delicious lemon aftertaste. The chicken florentine is packed with flavor - grilled chicken, sautéed mushrooms, spinach and mozzarella cheese. Super good! This location has a walk up window with an outdoor patio area with tables and shading. What a nice addition to my old digs."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late dessert and had (of course) the Nutella crepe. It was wonderful. Found out that they've only been at this location for eight weeks, which is why The Crepe Club is not yet listed on the mall directory map. Trust me, it's there! Best of luck to the owners, for whom this eatery and bakery is clearly a labor of love."}
{"text":"This showed up on the \"Hot and New\" filter, and we were looking for something to break up the monotony of the usual lunch spots...  The Crepe Club is next to Stingray Sushi, in a part of this center that is set up as a bunch of small spaces - it looked like they were one of two or three (out of 8 or 10 spaces) that were still open (though the hot dog place is supposedly relocating to a new place out in the center lawn).  We walked in - first thing on the left is a refrigerator with freshly squeezed fruit juices in bottles, plus coconut water and Perrier...no sodas (not even 'natural').  Iced tea is on the menu board, but not available.  While we were waiting to order, we notice that there is very limited seating (two tables outside - one 8 top (or 4 and 4) and one 4 top, plus a spot inside with only one chair).  The young lady working the counter was on the phone, and the people in front of us were just standing at the front.  Turns out, they had already ordered.  After a couple of minutes, the young lady hung up and said she could help us.  We asked for her recommendation - she suggested a sandwich.  It's a crepe place - why would your first recommendation be a sandwich?  \"Danger, Will Robinson!\"  Asked, \"Yes, great...but what about crepes?\"  She suggested Chicken Florentine for the savory crepes, and a sugar crepe (don't think that was even on the menu).   My friend ordered the Chicken Florentine, I ordered the 3 cheese.  They use the same batter for both savory and sweet crepes (I'm more accustomed to something like a buckwheat batter for the savory - maybe that's not common everywhere).  The crepe itself had very little flavor, and seemed over-thick for a crepe (yet not quite pancake thick).  The spinach in the chicken florentine wasn't sauteed prior to being added into the crepe - my friend said the spinach was pretty much raw (not that raw spinach is bad, just not what you expect in a 'florentine' dish).  The 3 cheeses were all pretty bland, though they had tossed in some Rosemary or something which added some seasoning.  Both crepes were topped with Béchamel sauce - also bland.  Maybe the Nutella/banana crepe would've been the way to go?"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of crepes, sweet or savory, The Crepe Club is worth checking out...either for a light brunch or midday nosh if you work near the Biltmore Fashion Park.  I was fortunate and was able to sample their sweet crepes for free as part of a promo that was listed in AZ Central.  The creperie itself is small and bright. The light wall paper and chandeliers give the place an air of casual elegance.  There's even \"patio\" seating just outside the door, shared with Royal Coffee Bar & Roasting Co.  The area has enough shade that enjoying your crepe al fresco is perfect.  Looking forward to trying my first savory crepe soon!   Four stars for service and available seating. Three stars for the sweet Parisian...due to serving it in the paper cone, all the sugar and butter appeared to pool toward the bottom. Still tasty. Five stars for the Regular and Mini size options!  Jury is still out on savory crepes.  Perhaps, my updated review will be bumped up to 4 or 5 stars after I savor something savory."}
{"text":"I order from them frequently through UberEats. The large Chicken Florentine is a satisfying, generous portion! The large strawberry crepe was very skimpy. Overall good experience. Recieved a personal phonecall from a friendly, intelligent staff member once-updating me on my order and I appreciated that."}
{"text":"I just order a half dozen macaroons and asked for a special request that they write a sweet note for a special someone and to no surprise, they made my request and Uber eats delivered on time. The Crepe Club is our favorite by far and the owner is a real gem."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, if you come with friends I would suggest you either all get savory or sweet? The savory ones are made in back and the sweet ones up front. As a result, we had about an hour wait between my friends savory crepe and the rest of the sweet ones because the guy up front was so busy taking orders and helping people. They need to rethink their business strategy."}
{"text":"I had food delivered. The French toast was cold and flavorless, missing all toppings. The crepe was undercooked and possibly included packaging of the Brie , it tasted awful, (Brie and apple crepe) we ended up throwing away the food and cooking."}
{"text":"What a lovely place!  My husband(favorite crepe:peanut butter and banana) and I(favorite:caprese) been here several times and I have brought several friends.  The staff is always pleasant, service is professional and friendly and the crepes are wonderful savory or sweet. The young workers are kind and go out of their way even when it is busy.  I know their Operations Manager Maria Mc Clelland has played a part in their training.  From my first visit I was so impressed with her ease and professional ways. Kudos to all."}
{"text":"So I was in for the first time tonight. My girlfriend and I were at the Apple Store and had a long wait time. We found Crepe Club and fell in love with the atmosphere. Walking in I immediately noticed the sharp white marble floors and tables. The feeling of white and purple flowers all over the restaurant with glass windows and mirrors, is refreshing and opening. So I kind of made it into a special date and told the cashier. My girlfriend sat at a table near by so I told the employee I'm going to whisper my order to surprise my girlfriend. She went along with everything and was so helpful. We got the lemon crepe, strawberry shortcake, Croissant French toast, and a chicken and tomato pesto? Everything was giving us chills. From the sweet but subtle lemon crepe to the creamy and nutty brown sugar strawberry shortcake, it was divine and such a gorgeous presentation! On top of everything the manager noticed us and was kind enough to inquire why we came and if we were on a special date.  We were interested in the macaroons they sold and she offered us a taste of two. They melted in our mouths! After a friendly conversation, she left, only to return moments later with a 5 dollar gift card for next time. From entering the establishment, to the helpful and fun-hearted employees and welcoming environment.. we left feeling at home and will be returning soon, hungry for more!!"}
{"text":"So curl my toes with another one of your crêpes as The Crêpe Club is quaint, friendly & delicious (my sister's new fave place).  A crêpe: type of very thin pancake (French origin, deriving from the Latin crispa, meaning \"curled\").   My sister was craving crêpes & asked me to find her a place to go. Of course I checked YELP lol & read their reviews. Some of the reviews on this place are from their temporary other location but still within the Biltmore Fashion Park with their now newer location is next to Williams & Sonoma and is quite charming & adorable.   She went on a date there since I had to go to work for a couple of hours & loved it so much that she had to share with me & her daughter. She ended up going twice in one day haha.   She really enjoyed the Caprese (mozzarella, basil pesto tomatoes) & Strawberry 'ShortCrepe' (fresh strawberries, Biscoff crumbles, whipped cream).  Also, got a coconut cupcake & macarons.   We tried S'Mores Nutella (Nutella, marshmallows, Biscoff crumbles) & Strawberry 'ShortCrepe' with 'cold brew' coffee later.  Everything was deliciously sweet & decadent with very nice staff & owner.   They have Savory & Sweet Crêpes (w/additional add-ons if you wish), quiches, Acai bowl, baked goods, French toast, paninis, sandwiches, salads, pressed juices, shakes & other drinks avail."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for crepes and of course had to check out this new place at UNION in the Biltmore!  The space is quite compact, but good to pick up something quick and take it along with you.  The staff was so welcoming and excited to have us there.  I ordered a Nutella crepe and absolutely loved it - so very delicious!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you stand outside the restaurant window long enough, you will be amazed at how quickly the delicious crepes can be made to special order. Then if you continue to stand there, you will be rewarded with the yummy smells and it will draw you in like a magnet!  I stopped for a crepe today because it was a bit rainy in Phoenix here in November and I wanted comfort food. This little gem has been opened at the Biltmore shopping plaza for about 6 months. You get the Euro-French feel with the marble, chandelier and subway tile. It has some indoor seating. Rather cozy. And more seating outdoors though I think it's for anyone. There is a glass case that has some scrumptious pastries, if you don't want to order a crepe. Illy coffee machine behind front counter. There is a self-service condiment and beverage bar with spa water, Royal coffee and glass cases to purchase other bevvies. Not quite sure how that works since you place your order up front. Business was steady. The register/order taker seemed a little flustered. She had to keep switching between taking/processing orders/bussing tables/explaining to customer why coffee pot on self-serve was empty/making coffee up front.I saw 2nd waiter guy but he kept going to the back. Maybe doing dishes? 3rd guy was the crepe maker and he was spot on.  Friendly service. My crepe-Nutella with strawberries, was delicious. I'll be back to try savory breakfast crepes. Prices were very reasonable! Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place but was quickly disappointed. I ordered the chicken/egg/avocado crepe and a plain hot coffee with room. It took a while for me to get the coffee (I usually don't care but I was the only one in here) and then she brought me a cup of half and half and spilled it on the table and had it dripping down the cup by the time she set it down. Again, I usually don't mind things like this because I'm a pretty clumsy person but she didn't clean it up at all. So I put the cream and sugar in the coffee and taste it and it was the most burnt coffee I've ever tasted. It didn't even really taste like coffee, just like burnt water I guess? The crepe came out and the chicken was dry, as was the crepe as a whole. It definitely needed sour cream. I didn't ask for any because I was just kind of fed up (I was really excited to take myself out to a little breakfast this morning), so I don't know if they offer sour cream or not. I'm giving this place two stars because I bet their dessert crepes are delicious. But if you're gonna serve breakfast items, please make sure you're serving at least halfway decent coffee."}
{"text":"We ordered the Smores and the strawberry shortcake crepes and they did not disappoint. The biscoff cookie crumbles were great. Crepe was not as hot as I'd like but was delicious none the less. 4 stars."}
{"text":"Crepes are the best and Conner is Awesome, energetic and hard working. HE DESERVES A RAISE! It's rare seeing a worker who genuinely cares about the customers so I commend him for that."}
{"text":"I remember the first time I came for a yelp elite get together. I fell in love with the crepes. Not only are the crepes delicious the service is wonderful."}
{"text":"I ordered through a delivery service I'm now sitting for an hour and a half and the order hasn't been picked up also tried the restaurant no one picked up the phone there wasn't a voicemail message and the mailbox is full this is not a place I will EVER try"}
{"text":"hands down the best crepes in Phoenix!! great flavored croissants and great service! perfect cute area to eat with friends and family! the crepes both savory and sweet were DELICIOUS. would recommend the nutella with strawberries, the three cheese, and the chicken florentine. they were all very good and we're definitely going to come back! we also got some coffee and fresh juice. both super good and would recommend!"}
{"text":"I had the caprese crepe, regular size.  Surprisingly, it was actually bigger and more food than I anticipated, the small one would have been better suited for my meal.  The 3 star review is because it was \"ok\", there was way too much balsamic on the crepe so it was a little overbearing.  I will go back though and try something from the dessert menu, so not a bad place just have had better tasting crepes."}
{"text":"I tried the Nutella and banana crepe and it was delicious! The owners were super nice and the place is very classy. I love how it's inside the Biltmore shopping area! Very convenient."}
{"text":"I had a crepe (not on the menu, basically it was the smores sub banana for marshmallows. It was really good. They were busy and on the table next to me there was a couple that one got their savory crepe while the other was still waiting. The owner apologized and I'm pretty sure gave them something on the house while they waited. I thought that was really good service especially at this time of the year when things can get crazy."}
{"text":"Beautiful location, friendly employees, and delicious food! I'm obsessed with the Nutella and strawberry crepe! Seriously so good! I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Went at 9:15am and was not open hours online say 8:30. Please fix. Hope to try it another time"}
{"text":"I wanted to wait to write my review, in case the owner really made good on his promise. Sadly, he did not.  Took my daughter to the San Tan mall for an afternoon of us time. I asked if she wanted a snack. I had wanted Wetzels, she wanted a Crepe.   We've been in before, and it was good, so I agreed.   The customer in front of us had ordered their food. The girl behind the counter politely said \"I'll be right with you\" as she was making theirs. Excellent, I was in no big rush. I patiently waited.   When she finished, I ordered two strawberry/banana Nutella crepes. Pretty easy order. Total came to be $21 and change. I paid and we sat down to talk a little while we waited.   The girl making the crepes starts to put a LOT of whipped cream on the crepes she was making. I had just assumed she was finishing up the order for the customer before me, and thought nothing further. She then brought them to our table. I questioned her, a little confused since there was NO Nutella and LOTS of whipped cream on it (she had in error made two strawberry shortcake crepe). No big deal, mistakes happen! Until she said \"oh, you wanted Nutella on it?\"  No, I replied \"I ordered a strawberry/banana Nutella\"  Her \"fix\" for it was to simply add Nutella.  No, no, no. Was NOT the same!  I told her that just by adding Nutella doesn't make my crepe correct and I wouldn't eat the crepe. She threw it away with an attitude.   Never did she apologize to me for her error. I ended up walking out - no refund, no apology. I did go back to explain that I didn't care for her attitude. I asked for the owners contact info, A coworker of hers explained she wouldn't give it out, but took my name & number.   The owner called and said he would gladly refund my money AND send me a gift card so I could come back and give them another try.   It's been 3-4 WEEKS now. No refund, no gift card, nothing. I didn't want for them to give me more than what I had paid, but I really wanted them to give me at least my money back.   I have no need to ever go back."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! The owner/owners seriously need to get rid of their staff and hire new ones that will actually like working at an establishment like this and is great in customer service. My friend and I have been wanting to try this place out for a while now and we finally decided to go today. We had already looked at the menu outside so we knew what we wanted to order ahead of time. When we walked in, we didn't even get greeted or anything. We stood at the counter and the workers didn't even acknowledge us. It being our first time there, we didn't know if we were supposed to sit down and they would come take our order or we were supposed to order our food at the counter. After standing there for a little bit, I finally asked the worker if we should sit down and they told us yes. We went and sat down. 15 minutes go by and nobody came to take our order. It wasn't busy whatsoever, there was only a couple of tables occupied table so we were a little confused why none of the workers came to our table. A couple walked in and I hear the lady placing her order at the counter. As one of the worker walked by our table, I asked him if we were supposed to order up front and he said yes. We walked up to the counter and the girl working there asked us what our order number was. Smh! I told her that we were told to sit down and that we never got to order anything. We decided this place wasn't worth trying and definitely would NOT recommend it to anybody. Such a disappointment cause my fatass was craving crepes too!"}
{"text":"Not worth what I paid for. My friend I ordered Paninis and the portion is REALLY small. I had to request them to remake my panini as there were two small pieces of cherry tomato and an inch of mozzarella cheese at the edge. Basically a blob of filling on one side and the rest is all bread. Salad had only 15-20 spinach leaves. They didn't even apologize for that mistake. Terrible."}
{"text":"Fenomenal place! Savory French treats and delicious croissants, the crepes are amazing and the business owners are very friendly and hospitable. A true gem of a place and a great addition to the Biltmore fashion park and greater Phoenix area! You have to try it!"}
{"text":"What an adorable little place & wow were the crepes super. I had turkey, Swiss & pesto and my fiancé had the Swiss, mushroom & egg. We split a almond croissant which was incredible. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Really great experience. I got a Regular sized Strawberry \"Shortcrepe\"  ($7.95) and a Small sized Turkey and Swiss crepe ($4.85). Both crepes were delicious. I'm usually not a fan of savory crepes, but the Turkey and Swiss was well worth the price. The strawberry crepe was larger than I expected it to be, but like most crepes it certainly won't fill you up.  The restaurant is very cute inside with mirrors all around and tufted benches. It is a rather small restaurant, so large groups might have a hard time coming here.   The service was great as well. The cook was friendly and helpful when I was ordering. Also, I was asked how my meal was and my meal was prepared quickly.  Definitely worth a try!  Food.............9/10 Location......10/10 Ambiance....10/10 Service........10/10 Value.............9/10"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times over the past 6 months. I LOVE the crepes but it takes FOREVER TO EVEN GET ONE. On one occasion I was the only one in there and it took them 20 minutes to make it. I guess they're worth the wait, but it shouldn't take 20 minutes to make a crepe."}
{"text":"Had a craving for a Nutella Crepe!! There's no better place to go than the Crepe Club!! Always delicious and the service is always friendly!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine decided we should have Crepes for lunch, It didn't take much to convince me as I love crepes, so off we went. The Crepe Club, is located next to Williams Sonoma. The atmosphere is relaxing and pleasant.  There is marble everywhere, and the restaurant  is very clean and bright.   You place your order at the counter and your entrees are delivered to your table. The Crepe Club offers a variety of crepes to indulge your every craving. Theres Chicken,Turkey, Ham, Spinach, Cheese, Yogurt, and Fruit options.  On this visit I had the strawberries and cream and it was delicious. I can honestly say that this is one of the best crepe I ever had. I can't wait to visit again and try some of the other options. If Crepes  aren't your thing, the Crepe Club offers Hot & Iced coffee, Frappuccino, smoothies, Panini's, salads, sandwiches, and quiche.  So if you ever find yourself craving delicuous crepes and coffee head over to The Crepe Club,  you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've taken my girlfriend to 5 different crepe places this week since she is in town from Germany and loves them... this is by far the worst we have been to. All the tables were dirty and had food on them but it was dead inside, I ordered a crepe and added strawberries  but no strawberries were on it but the girl had disappeared to the back the entire rest of the meal... the atmosphere or really bad and there were a dozen tables but only chairs for half if them... idk just feels run down. Much better options in town... don't come here..."}
{"text":"The service was lacking. Ordered a nutella crepe with ice cream. The crepe arrived but the ice cream did not, so I reminded the server about the ice cream. 10 minutes later I asked them again and they said they'd forgotten. She proceeded to run back to the kitchen to get some, arrived back at the table with chocolate smeared all over both hands, an ice cream scoop in one hand, and the ice cream in a dish in the other. Not very appealing. Didn't seem to happy that we were there either. Not the greatest experience for a crepe treat."}
{"text":"Everything was wrong in this restaurant. Starting with the service and then the food. What I ordered was not even close to what the menu says. The manager told me that \"They can't please all their customers\" ... really. I totally understand that at some point some mat not be at your taste. But not being what you ordered is totally different. Bad experience. Will never go back..."}
{"text":"Excellent. Was looking for a light breakfast and this place had amazing food and a quaint little vibe. If a croissant, espresso and crepe sounds good to you then definitely come check this out. It was very affordable too, especially for this neighborhood. Thanks I'll be back!"}
{"text":"First off it says online that they close at 9pm and the girl in the store said 8pm. She was less than enthusiastic when we walked in. She made a point to make sure we knew they closed in 30 minutes. We asked for a croissant sandwich and she said they were out. It's a main component to their menu! They need to step up their customer service and fix their website."}
{"text":"Having recently tried the Crepe Club location at the ASU campus, I was eager to try the Biltmore Fashion Park location. What a gem! The Crepe Club is an adorable restaurant perfect to enjoy a light lunch or a sweet crepe dessert. When you look through the front window, you can see the staff making the crepes on the pan. I opted to enjoy a savory crepe (spinach florentine) for lunch with some iced tea, After I ordered, I helped myself to getting iced tea at the self-serve drink station and sat down at a table inside (there is also adequate outdoor seating as well), My crepe order was brought to me quickly soon afterwards. It was very tasty and filling. I got the large size and was unable to finish it, but the staff kindly gave me a to-go box to bring home. Will definitely plan to return and can't wait to try a sweet dessert crepe next!"}
{"text":"Crepes are amazing.  It's a fact.  There's something for everyone.  There are sweet crepes.  There are savory crepes.  On The Crepe Club's menu, you have Parisian and Nutella and Creme de Lemon crepes along with Chicken Florentine and Italiana and Caprese crepes.  See the full menu here:  https://www.thecrepeclub.com/menu.html.    But catch this...there has been a contest going on.  My girlfriend and I each got an APPLE SPICE crepe, which is only available through Sunday as a part of the contest.  Apples, cinnamon, brown sugar, and powdered sugar.  Soooo yummy!  Check out the photos I uploaded and see the finalists here:  https://www.thecrepeclub.com/vote.html.  I'd highly you get the Apple Spice while it's available (through June 26).    Now, I've been to the ASU location of The Crepe Club though that's a small walk-up window.  This is the main location with plenty of seating and other dishes beyond just crepes.  The staff are very knowledgable and helpful.  In addition to a pair of mini Apple Spice crepes, we also each got a mini Mediterranean Chicken crepes.  I strongly recommend that you get two mini crepes instead of one large crepe.  Sweet and savory together are a plus, and when you order at the Biltmore location, you can even have them bring the sweet crepes to you for dessert once you finish with your savory crepes.    Also, look at your receipt and complete the survey for $5 off your next visit.  That is more than enough to cover a mini crepe or most of a large crepe.  It pays to give feedback.    I definitely recommend visiting The Crepe Club (any location) though if you can make it to the Biltmore location by Sunday, get the Apple Spice crepe!"}
{"text":"So I just realized this past week that though I'm on the ASU Tempe Campus every day working, I didn't know that The Crepe Club was right in the heart of it.  What an amazing hidden gem in the middle of the campus!!  I stopped by today for the first time, and had such a positive experience.    Among other students and staff, it was clear watching others order that everyone was there for something different.  Some stopped by for the delicious coffee.  Others for a \"Sweet Crepe\" like the \"S'Mores Nutella\" or \"Strawberry Shortcrepe.\"  I stopped by on the other hand for a \"Savory Crepe\" for lunch.  I chose the Mediterranean Chicken regular-size crepe, made with grilled chicken, mozzarella, garlic, and sun dried tomato aioli.  Yum!!  I would have loved to try one of the \"Sweet Crepes\" though the crepe I had was so filling that I didn't have room for another one, even if it was dessert.  That just means that I need to come back another day.    I was greeted by Maria, who recognized me from a long while back when she managed another dining venue on the campus.  Not only did I feel like a valued customer, but I saw Maria and her staff treating EVERY student and staff member before and after me with the same respect.  That's called customer service!  She even walked around checking on how everyone was doing and what they thought of the food.    I should say that this particular location of The Crepe Club is an outdoor stand-alone restaurant with outdoor seating, though I had no problem finding a place to sit.  I wonder what it would have been like between classes though.  Regardless, the delicious food and the great customer service make it worth stopping by!  I look forward to trying out their Biltmore location at some point soon."}
{"text":"Not as lovely an experience as the actual decor of the bistro. It's any other Sunday that we went in for simple crepes and yet our food didn't come out for half an hour. They said it was because they were packed and understaffed. Well they should have told us that when we walked in and before we made an order that it would be a long wait. Plus the thickness of the crepes were thick and tasted very inauthentic. For 12.95 my friend and I got an over cooked crepe with a little apple and Brie and watery coffee. Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service. The drapes were fresh and delicious.  My kids love the turkey croissants. I just love the hot crepes"}
{"text":"I've been The Crepe Club quite a few times for juice and everyone has always been very nice.  Today, however, I walked in for a savory chicken crepe and, while the gentleman helping me was very nice, the crepe disappointed.  The flavor was bland, it was cold when I got it, the chicken was dry, and the actual crepe seemed under cooked.  I had my crepe to go so there was no time to go back or to exchange the crepe.  I expected so much more.  I would only go back for desserts..never again for a savory crepe."}
{"text":"Not crazy at all about this place.  It's clean with a pretty decoration. The staff is nice and helpful.   They offer a small variety of desserts and drinks but they focus on Crepes which for me they are ok.  The crepes comes with a very light amount of filling.   In two different occasions I order the same to see if there's a difference between but it was exactly the same.  I ordered a very basic crepe with Nutella.  I wasn't satisfied at all, maybe I was expecting the same crepes with Nutella I eat at the streets of Paris.  They should ask if you want or not more filling and then you can decide.  I think they can do better because it's a nice place when you are craving for something sweet."}
{"text":"My son and I came here for breakfast. I love crepes, and this place did not disappoint. The current place is rather small. But pic told me they're moving to new location as soon as it is finished. We both had the strawberry shortcake crapes and they were delicious. I cannot wait to go back and try some of their other creations. They all look delicious. The two gentleman behind the counter were very courteous and friendly. And seem to enjoy their jobs very much.   The new location next to Williams and Sonoma is fantastic. Plenty of seating and French music, what more can you ask for.  They have expanded their menu with some me items. Everything is delicious. I love their crapes and their panini's delicious. The crêpe club continues to be my favorite Saturday breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. My strawberry crepe hardly had any strawberries in it. It tasted ok, but couldve been way better.  Smores crepe also lacked much filling. Overall, the flavors were just disappointingly mediocre.   I will go back to try the savory crepes. Hopefully, they are better. And hopefully they will start putting more filling in the desert ones, because they could be great.   They also have no bathroom. I thought that sit down restaurants had to have a bathroom. They sent me to the diner across the way, which was slightly awkward."}
{"text":"This place is adorable! I love that it's it's open early so I can get my fix before I spend my paycheck at Williams-Sonoma. I haven't actually had one of their crepes (I know I know) but I had their turkey baguette {turkey | avocado | basil mayo | lettuce | tomato} and it was awesome! The ingredients all tasted really fresh including the pressed beet juice! I cannot wait to be back to try some sweet crepes!"}
{"text":"My mom said that she will be dreaming about their crepes after our breakfast this morning! I agree! The coffee was great too!"}
{"text":"My Nutella crepe was delish, however you will wait for it. The service is fantastic, one of the employees gave my daughter a macaroon and visited with her. A little disorganized but well worth it. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I wanted a dessert on the go and something really cold to drink so I ordered the Caramel Espresso. What I got was an Iced Cafe Latte and it took forever to make it... as he took three other orders and had conversations with three other employee during this whole process. What I got was a cup of iced milk. There is nothing Coffee or Espresso about this drink and clearly the person that took my order had no desire to make what I actually ordered. My friend ordered the Iced Cafe Latte... and also got a cold glass of milk on ice. Thanks for making my lunch and shopping experience at the Biltmore Blah! Word of advice for your employees: customer service is what brings business back in even if it's just a cold beverage on a hot day!"}
{"text":"Went here because hours on Yelp said 0830.  We walk in and the doors are unlocked, the place is deserted and some worker who appears stoned tells us it's not open until 900.  Which is it, 0830 or 0900?"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! So convenient for students and very fast so you will always still have time to make it to class. But my favorite thing about The Crêpe Club is my favorite employee named Emma. She always greets me with such a friendly smile and is very costumer oriented, seeing her makes my day! She brings so much value to the club and makes the experience a 10/10. She is the reason I keep coming back aside from the delicious crêpes :)"}
{"text":"The owner was super nice and so was the staff. They were very accompanying, crepes and Macerons were delicious and the place is extremely clean, organized and cute. Really nice outdoor little bench to sit and the food was very fresh! I would go back and it is one of my favorite places! So glad they opened here."}
{"text":"I was walking around the Biltmore with one of my friends while my phone was getting fixed at the Apple store and stopped by this place when I saw someone spinning crepes by the window.   I had seen this place on TV a few times but never had the opportunity to stop by. I stepped inside and truly stumbled upon a gem. The setting of this place was absolutely beautiful; beautiful wall decor lined by posh tables and flowers around the store.   The register was to the left, surrounded by delectable pastries, colorful macaroons, and an employee spinning crepes. I took a menu with the intent of ordering my traditional Nutella crepe when the options flooded me with indecisiveness. After much deliberation, I went with the Creme de Lemon and my friend went with the Mediterranean Chicken. We opted to sit outside to enjoy the last few days before the heat. A tall, blonde employee brought our crepes out and asked if we needed anything else before we delved into the effervescent scents of the crepes.   Mine was surprisingly exceptional. I say this because I typically adhere to Nutella but this Creme de Lemon was delightful. It was perfectly sweet with a light hint of tartness and wasn't overbearing in the cream or sweetness. The weight of each flavor/ingredient was perfect. My friend absolutely loved hers as well. I could only get 1 bite in before she finished it but it was great in flavor and freshness.   We devoured our crepes without a conversation shared in less than 20 minutes. When we were finished, a kind woman by the name of Maria came to clear our plates and ask us how the food was. She was so kind and recommended that we try the breakfast next time.   If you are looking for a new spot brunch/lunch or a dessert, I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It's tucked into the corner so it may be easy to miss but it's definitely a hidden gem! I was stopped by here on my way before the movies from the aromas flowing out of the little location. I'm a huge sugar aficionado so naturally I was fixated by the smell. I walked in and I was greeted by an extremely friendly staff. I was indecisive and they suggested the Lemon Crepe. I sat down and enjoyed the beautiful quaint ambiance. After a few minutes, the server brought me a beautifully decorated Crepe with the flavorful scientist of lemon coming from the Crepe. I delved into my first soft bite and allowed the well balanced flavor combat my palate. Sweet, tart, and flavorful; I was in for a ride. Needless to say I devoured the Crepe in less than 3 minutes and will be back sooner than later!"}
{"text":"Stopped by after yoga with some friends. We had the apple Brie, dulce de leche , and the chocolate with strawberries. We all got the mini size and they made the perfect snack! Very cute place with lots of great options."}
{"text":"Went to the Biltmore for dinner and then had the crepe club for desert and they are really good. I had just a regular butter one but it is so delicious. All you need is that!  I would definitely try the Nutella with some fruit that would be the next one I do next time. The place smells delicious it's really cute but it is a little bit dirty sometimes because the staff can't get to it."}
{"text":"Savory or sweet, I love crepes. When my friends suggested we try the Crepes Club I was excited. Going by the map it's a little hard to find in the Biltmore shopping center. ol  The interior didn't bring to mind the picture of a French restaurant in France, but the crepes would be worth it... wouldn't they?   When I entered CC , the protocol was much like Wildflower Bread Co. Read the menu, order and pay at the front counter, get a number, get water, ice tea, and condiments for yourself, sit while waiting for your order. They were reasonably prompt.   Here's the problem  (for me). When I think crepes I think of florentine, a crepe triangle filled with chicken, spinach, herbs, and bechamel sauce in the crepe and a bit on top. The herbs  including rosemary were tasty as were the chicken and spinach. I couldn't see the sauce.   After sharing this observation with the woman I presume to be the owner/manager told me it had been absorbed into the chicken/spinach mixture. I  did taste some. However when I see or hear the word 'sauce' I do, call me crazy, expect to see sauce. My bad. My friends and I tried the lemon creme crepe.  The creme was a large dollop light, slightly sweet whip cream which I thoroughly enjoyed.  The lemon crepe on which I thought would have a delightful lemon sauce, didn't. Isn't French cooking known for the sauces???   I did my due diligence and asked the owner/manager about the lemon sauce. She does read Yelp. According to the posts, the lemon sauce was too sour/acidic and she adjusted the recipe to use a sprinkle of fresh juice instead of sauce. It just doesn't work.  Not much flavor.   Now, if you are not into sauce, ignore this review and add a star. The owner/manager was willing to listen and give me reasons why it is what it is.   Try Crepe Club and decide for yourself."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get crepes in North Phoenix! This place is excellent. The peanut butter, banana, honey crepe is my favorite. I love that they have a crepe of the day so there are always new things to try."}
{"text":"It was a good little place to eat. The staff was very friendly and the crepes were good .. once we got them it took a bit."}
{"text":"Sweets have a special place in my heart, and this place is the perfect place to satisfy a sweet tooth.  They also have meal like food, which I consider a little expensive, but the sweet crepes are at a good price.  The coffee is very good, and if you just get a regular brew, its very affordable."}
{"text":"This place was cute. The inside was adorable and would be perfect for a cute girls brunch. The crêpes were good and beautiful. The portions were great. I got two minis and was more than satisfied. I was so excited to try this place and low and behold they were out of coffee!! I have no clue how this happens at a primarily breakfast spot. I was not impressed with the customer service. The lady at the register, young gal was not very friendly or welcoming. In fact there was an Uber eats guy picking up a to-go order and both young girls working the front didn't treat him very nicely. It would be great for them to understand that most people don't dine at a crêpe spot so explaining the menu a tad or showing any kind of crêpe passion would have made our experience more fun and enjoyable. Customer service is EVERYTHING in places like these. I mean if you are out of coffee and can't do coffee for us...tell us what you CAN do for us. Customer after customer came in wanting coffee and they didn't so much as offer to comp the espressos as most people want coffee when they come dine on a Saturday morning. That's the best part. Anyways, good food. Call first to make sure they have coffee and don't expect the young gals working here to be anywhere as sweet as the crêpes."}
{"text":"Ehh. I was kind of expecting some authentic, fresh crepes but that is not what I got here. Pass.  To everyone: They DO NOT make the crepes at this location. They are pre-made and warmed up.   I came here on my lunch break and ordered the savory chicken florentine crepe. The interior was cute and had a Paris theme going on. But let me just say the whole set up of this place is confusing. As I was placing my order the girl said the drinks were self serve, but all that was available where she pointed was water or pressed juices. I opted for water out of lack of options. I pay and go sit down with my number. I heard 2 other tables finishing their food asking to close their check (no doubt thinking they had a server) and she told them she was unable to print the check they needed to pay up front. So I'm really not sure if you are supposed to pay BEFORE or AFTER. Its a casual place so I would assume you pay before you eat sort of like Pei Wei, etc.They should straighten that out.   The actual crepe was not even made on site. Do you know how easy it is to make a crepe? It takes less than a minute to cook. They even had the crepe burner and yet they proceeded to take a pre-made out of the refrigerator and just warm it on the burner and add the fillings... I don't understand that. Overall the taste was okay. I lived in Paris for a year and crepes should be a lot thinner and crispier. Mine was thick and doughy almost like it needed to be cooked longer. The filling was good and tasted fresh.  Overall I was just not impressed with this place. I probably wouldn't come back or recommend."}
{"text":"I had dulce de lethe crepes and croissant sandwich it was very delicious,  one of the best in the valley"}
{"text":"The Crepe Club is absolutely beautiful and I love the concept; we need more creperies in Arizona. However, I hate to say it...I have some complaints. The first sales clerk was not knowledgeable at all about the menu. They didn't have the giant fresh macaroons that are shown all over their Yelp pictures. In fact, the second sales person I spoke with told me they hadn't had fresh macaroons in a week! No thanks. After I sat down, both the employees disappeared in the back for the whole time I ate, missing a potential sale when another woman walked in and saw no one. The crepe was good, but not the best I've ever had. I got the creme de lemon and it was a little overwhelming with the amount of lemon juice. None the less, it was still enjoyed. Their prices are steep, the service is poor, and I'm off to try a different breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Found this place accidentally this afternoon and the service was excellent,  as were the fresh crepes.  The baked pastries from Delice made this a memory I hope to repeat and share. The crew was friendly and very informed.  I hope to return soon."}
{"text":"Not a great place for customer service. We decided what we wanted from the menu by the door outside. As we walked up to the counter thinking we need to order there, the staff told us to have a seat. 10-15 min go by and no one approached us to place an order. We noticed about 5 tables that weren't cleaned up and it was not busy at all. Restaurant looked like it should be nice and tidy for a place at biltmore, but there was crumbs everywhere, seats had stains all over, tables not kept up as customers leave.  After time pass, we asked if we should have placed our order at the counter? And the staff said yes when she walked passed by a few times and never said anything. Not worth eating there after all as the staff was rude to us by not taking our orders when we first approached the counter. Wouldn't recommend wasting your time here."}
{"text":"The staff here is awesome and so accommodating! I love the breakfast crepes but don't eat meat, and they let me sub in avocado every time with no problem! The servings are always perfect and well-made, and the service is super quick--I've never had to wait more than 5 or 10 minutes, even during a huge rush. The food is absolutely delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like, I'd highly recommend it to everyone on campus!!"}
{"text":"After one recent good experience with freshly made desert crepe this late lunch was awful. Crepes were pre-made and served reheated. My small Nutella desert crepe was brought to the table 10 min before the turkey crepe for a main meal. Turkey pesto crepe was horrible, again not freshly made and stuffed with dry turkey meat. $20 disaster. I didn't think crepe can ever be bad...I was wrong."}
{"text":"I was so excited to have a crepe, but did not even finish my lunch. The egg, cheese and sausage crepe was dry and bland. Plus my $4 cappuccino was the smallest I ever had. Perhaps dessert crepes are better, so I may try it again. But I will get coffee from the place across the street."}
{"text":"Most delicious crepes and best customer service! I absolutely love French desserts and this was exactly what I needed. I can't tell what's better, the Nutella crepe or the Biscoff lotus crepe. Extremely friendly and sweet staff as well"}
{"text":"This place is tasty but you will wait an excessive amount of time for your order. The restaurant is managed by high schoolers / early college age staff. They are experts at quoting inaccurate times as well as being generally rude to customers. You would expect fine customer service at the Biltmore but unfortunately whoever owns this establishment takes no pride in customer service or their staff."}
{"text":"Beautiful romantic decor in beautiful Biltmore Fashion Park and surprisingly the price was very reasonable.  We sat outside in court-yard the weather was beautiful, it was perfect to enjoy our crepes and people watch.  We loved our savory *chicken florentine crepe* & sweet *PBH peanut butter banana honey* it was delicious.   All the staffs were very nice especially Sissy and Maria, they rocks! We called Sissy the terrific .  We will definitely comeback and try something else in the menu.  Thank you Hayley and Yelp!"}
{"text":"Crêpe: /krep/ - Noun: a light, thin and crispy pancake.   The Crêpe Club: overpriced, overhyped, an embarrassing disappointment. The Crêpe Club gives me the creeps. (Pun intended)   Located in the Biltmore Fashion Square, The Crêpe Club shares its trendy and glamorized appearance with its neighboring retail stores. The marble-esque interior design overlays bright chandeliers and polished mirrors, creating a vapid illusion of extravagance and luxury. A few tables and booths take up the majority of the café, with an interesting self-serve bar offering water and utensils.   Don't let the décor fool you.   My visit to The Crêpe Club began with a young man welcoming into the Club by unenthusiastically mumbling  \"Take a seat and come back up here to order!\". Taken aback, I asked him, \"can I order up here now?\" He replied back with a irritated voice, \"What do you want?\"   After our interaction, my first impression was that the customer service i had was lacking, but I was willing to overlook that in hopes that the crêpes would compensate for the lack of generosity. Unfortunately, my hopes were not fulfilled.   Our order: Regular Chicken Florentine Crepe and a Regular Strawberry Crepe, 1 croissant, 1 orange juice, 1 coffee.  Total cost: $36.41.   Now I am by no means a crêpe connoisseur, but I am able to clearly distinguish a crêpe from a soggy, rubbery and tasteless disc. I understand that crêpes should exhibit a slight tinge of browning while at the same time, have a texture fluffy and crispy.   My crêpe felt like chewing on undercooked dough; zero crisp at all. The béchamel tasted excruciatingly artificial, similar to a velveeta variety. The chicken, interestingly enough, also retained a rubbery-like texture. To be honest, I believe my Crêpe was not actually a crepe, but rather, it took on the form of a Chicken Florentine pancake-sandwich.   The first Crêpe came out in about 10 minutes. As for the Strawberry Crêpe, after about 25 more minutes of waiting I had requested to have it placed \"to-go\". I'm not sure if the delay in food arrival was due to the employee or potentially a behind-the-scenes mishap in the kitchen.   When we finally received the Strawberry Crepe, it looked very similar to a syrup-drenched pancake. In fact, I wish it actually was a pancake because it probably would've tasted much better. This \"Crepe\" continued to follow a recurring trend of pure sogginess. Imagine opening up a to go box when you are expecting a beautiful delicious crêpe, but instead you find a shriveled up, cold, and wrinkly-looking flattened sphere. Again; I will refer to this crêpe as a strawberry pancake-sandwich.   In summary, The Crêpe Club offers a pseudo-luxury experience in conjunction with weak and flavorless excuses for crêpes. I would not return here even if the crêpes were $3 dollars. The café feels like a trap spot; a bait that entices hungry and curious customers into taking a stop. From the appearance and price alone, you would expect something that tastes much higher quality than a pancake-sandwich my 6-year old nephew could make.    At just over $10 for a crêpe, the price is just not worth it. Its overall flavor, presentation, texture, and savoriness, combined together to create a shameful representation of a \"crêpe\"."}
{"text":"Okay I've ordered uber eats from here twice. First time I ordered the macarons, assorted cookies, and mini Nutella crepe. The cookies weren't in the bag. But the crepe was good it had the Nutella on top and lots inside. And the macarons are really good. Still sad about the cookies.  I decided to try again and ordered the larger crepe for $2 more and the macarons. When we got the crepe it barely had any Nutella in it and nothing drizzled on top. Don't think I'll order from here again."}
{"text":"Right when you walk in you see their crepe station, and I saw some brown spread they were putting onto a crepe, I asked what it was and they told me it was biscoff spread. I've never tried it before, so they were nice enough to give me a sample of it. I liked it, it tasted like graham crackers and wasn't super sweet at all but flavorful. I ordered the strawberry shortcrepe and substituted the whipped cream for the biscoff spread. I loved how fluffy the crepe was, and the flavor was perfect! Nothing was overly sweet just the way I liked it."}
{"text":"This place rocks. It is located in the Biltmore shopping area and it is a beautiful place to come take a stroll, get something to eat, and to do some shopping. I was close by for an appointment so I thought I'd stop in and take home some dinner. The CC is adorable and well-decorated, there was seating inside and outside and they happened to have an event that day but wasn't a problem for me since I was taking my food to-go.  I saw Maria, who is the manager at this particular location and who I met at the ASU location back in April. She is so welcoming and accommodating and made my experience that much better. I was boring and ordered the same two mini-crepes as before: the Italian and the S'mores Nutella. Sweet and savory to satisfy all the taste buds. I also got an iced latte which was good but had too much caffeine for me. I took everything home to enjoy and was happy that they were still delicious after they cooled down. I finished the Nutella crepe the next day and still thought it was great.  I should be adventurous and try new crepes but when you know what's good, it's hard to change!"}
{"text":"Great authentic French Crepes in Phoenix.  Chicken Florentine was delicious. The new Dulce De Leche Crepe is a great addition.  Good service and friendly people."}
{"text":"I always had great authentic French Crepe here. My favorite is the Chicken Florentine and obviously Nutella."}
{"text":"The crepes were very good.  We had the apple and brie and the Mediterranean.  What wasn't good was the 30 minute wait for those crepes and the fact that they're $10."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in a fancy mall. I tired the crepe with nutella and like it although it was heavy.  One of friend did not like the food because he thought the crape wasn't prepared perfectly.  Overall, the place did not have the atmosphere for group or couples. The prices for the desert crepes is reasonable. Also, the plates, and silverware were plastic, and weren't appropriate for this kind of restaurant. (We did not like the self-serve)  The place worth a try."}
{"text":"The place itself is gorgeous! But the food is bleh. We ordered 3 coconut waters and a strawberry n cream crepe with vanilla ice cream. Total: $21.00   Experience: we walked in and were greeted and asked if we've ever been there before. We say no and they tell us that we can sit down and look at the menu and when we're ready to order we could go up the the ordering station and order then pay. So I tell her what we want and she messes up on my order. I tell her 3 coconut waters and she only gives me one. I ask her politely for 2 more and kindly gets them for me. So I finish up the order and pay and she gives me a cute ticket stand with a number on it and the waters and then wait for the crepe. The wait itself was quick. We only waited 10 minutes or so. Once we get the crepe we saw that it was okay looking. There was a couple slices of strawberries and a dollop of whipped cream on the side. The crepe itself was thick and chewy. More like a thin chewy pancake then a crepe. Once we take the second bite we notice there was this milky liquid coming out and assume it's the ice cream that's melted. Then we realize that it was melted whipped cream and realize once more that they didn't give us the ice cream that I paid extra for. So the lady comes back and asks if everything is okay and I said sure but we were missing the ice cream. She jumps up and literally runs to go get it. But when she returns, she comes back with this little container with the ice cream... I was expecting better quality food then what I paid for. Not sure if I want to come back to be honest..."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this cute little place.  Firstly,  it's beautiful  and the staff are friendly, secondly, the crepes were delicious! However,  my husband's dish came nearly 10 minutes before mine....so his was cool once we started eating.  One would think the coffee would be excellent but it was rather weak, so for me it was a big letdown.  Overall, a fair grade...maybe worth another try..."}
{"text":"I went to the other location on campus next to manzanita and I order a latte which was 5.25 and way over priced because the cup was only filled 2/3 of the way. The girl forgot to put the espresso in so she only gave me steamed milk. I didn't try it till I got in my car and it was too late to go back. I think it's obvious why I'm giving a one star review."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Very nice location also. Call them of their hours. Yelp time is inaccurate."}
{"text":"I had the Mediterranean Chicken last week & I've been back on my lunch break 3 other times since then... so addicting!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place on the south side of the Biltmore shopping \"mall.\" They also currently have a little crepe stand in the middle. I had an almond croissant that was so soft and wonderful. Great almond flavor and really melt-in-your mouth fresh tasting croissant!  I have plans to go back and have a Nutella crepe and possibly try one of their savory crepes too and will update my review then, but felt it was important to get the word out that this place is worth visiting!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's always delicious. They are friendly and have a ton of great options. Last time I was there, I got 2 mini crepes (PBH & Swiss & mushroom breakfast crepe) for about $5 each.  They have indoor and outdoor seating, and they validate parking."}
{"text":"I've gone to The Crepe Club once when I was on the hunt for yummy french macarons. This is conveniently located in The Biltmore with lots of shops and restaurants. All the flavors I got were great, though they are pricy (as one would expect in this area). I have not tried the famous crepes but I definitely plan to come back for them. I'll update my review then."}
{"text":"Major disappointment.  After salivating for months waiting to try these crepes I finally got the chance about a week ago. We ordered to go 3 cheese crepes 1 Nutella crepe 2 chipotle beef paninis   Cons -We called ahead and still had to wait an extra 20 minutes for our order to be ready (even though there was no one else in the restaurant) -our order was not correct when we finally did receive it -the crepes were soggy and had no flavor  -small portion sizes -our total came to over $60  a ridiculous price for very little mediocre food and  Pro -the staff was very nice   I wish I could give this place more stars, but it was terrible. Sadly we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Came at the insistence of a friend that had to try it. I wasn't really in the mood for a crepe so I ordered the Rosemary Chicken Panini. My friend had the Chicken Florentine Crepe. This will be my choice if I come again. It was huge and filled with chicken, mushrooms, spinach and cheese. Unfortunately I couldn't try hers because I was getting over being sick and didn't want to risk spreading it. She ate it all and ordered a lemon crepe to split with hubby at home.  On the menu my panini sounded wonderful, however it was pretty lack luster. The menu states grilled chicken, rosemary olive oil, garlic spread, sun dried tomatoes and mozzarella.   It was cut into 3 triangles and in some I found very little chicken but enough cheese to cover a large pizza. Tasted the garlic but other than an orange color in the garlic and oil I could not find any sun dried tomatoes. Funny how a menu implies one thing (tomato pieces) but what you get is completely different. It was basically a hot cheese and chicken sandwich with garlic flavor. I'm from Wisconsin so I like my cheese, but not a ridiculous amount. The next day when I went to reheat the remaining triangle I picked out solidified cheese chunks.  Guess I should've adhered to the old saying \"When in Rome...\" Next time I'll stick to the food the restaurant is advertising in their name. Duh  Gave it 4 stars tho because the restaurant is quaint and comfortable and my friends choice looked awesome! I would give it another try."}
{"text":"Crepe was great but 3 stars for poor customer service. First time here today, and ordered takeout on Yelp which was super convenient. However, I assumed I would receive a phone call once my order was ready because I provided my phone number, and they never did. Not an issue as I was on time but when I walked in, and told the girl I ordered a crepe on Yelp, she looked at me like a deer in headlights and asked if I ordered a Nutella with banana crepe. I answered yes, and she grabbed my order and handed it to me without saying a word. I asked if a fork was in the bag, and she just nodded her head. The crepe was great, and the ordering process on Yelp was super convenient but the young girl who assisted me could really improve her customer service skills. Maybe a smile? Maybe a \"Hello, how can I help you?\" Maybe a \"Thank you?\" Hope my experience is better next time."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place on multiple occasions. I've tried the sausage and egg crepe, as well as Parisian, and cheese/butter sandwich. All were very tasty -- It's just what I needed on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"WOW OH MY! These crepe's were fabulous!   The combined feel of simplicity and french cuisine is the perfect way to describe The Crepe Club. Whether you are looking for a flavorful, innovative sandwich or a that perfect afternoon delight, The Crepe Club is your one stop shop.  Oh and don't get me started on those juices....B-E-E-TIFUL! This is the perfect \"on-the-go\" option for everyone living the fast-paced life in AZ.  Last but not least, the coffee at The Crepe Club is the perfect taste of Arizona as it is crafted locally and brewed to perfection. Yummy!  Overall, two thumbs up, five stars, and satisfied tastebuds. Will recommend to all my friends and family to stop into this AMAZING establishment."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! It's the best meal for a light lunch. I order the cold turkey and avocado but always ask them to heat up the turkey. SO GOOD. The service and staff is incredible as well. I'm always so pleased and happy after I leave this place."}
{"text":"My first experience was amazing! Payson helped me and made me a s'mores crepe. It was to die for and could have fed three people so definitely worth the price or get the mini! I appreciated the friendly staff and nice atmosphere. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place just opened up on ASU's campus near the engineering school. I tried both the chicken florentine and strawberry shortcrepe and they were both really awesome! I like how you can get mini crepes (which are still good in size)! Look forward to visiting again & I think they have a location at the Biltmore as well."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go out my way to visit this place again. The crepes reminded me of food you'd buy from a food truck- they use a little portable grill in the front to cook them like they do at the farmers market we visit. Crepes were ok, but if you stuff anything with nutella and cookies, can you really go wrong? We also tried a quiche ($13) and were unimpressed- it tasted like a quiche you might buy at trader joes and microwave. It came with a salad, which was only spring mix with a vinaigrette on it- no vegetables or cheese or anything on it. Food took a long time, despite it not being very busy. Everyone at the table was served at different times as well, so some of us sat and waited while others ate."}
{"text":"We first started to get crepes back when there where on mill Ave under a different name back then hands down 10 stars. The sous chef would make them at night out on the porch  highly skilled very nice presentation and the place was always packed at night.   Now it's just a hot mess we went back to mill only to find the old place is closed down   someone said he was making the crepes on asu campus on a food truck?? But all we could find was another lack luster crepe club"}
{"text":"Mhm I was craving crepes at work and postmates + Crepe Club came through    They have so many flavors and are reasonably priced! I got the small size egg and sausage savory crepe and it filled me up pretty well! I will definitely need to stop in and try one of their sweet crepes.   If you're not sure you want to commit to an entire crepe, just try one of the small ones. Good portion and great taste."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!! Ordered some food from here off of ubereats and it is absolutely phenomenal. Everything tastes fresh and delicious. Will def have to go try it out in person too. SOOOOO good!!!"}
{"text":"A true find. Best crepes I've ever had! Excellent presentation and amazing flavors. A great date place."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS And love the location!!!! I would eat here every morning if I could, everything I've tried has been delicious!! The interior of this place is adorable too! Went here the first time for a free crepe day promotion they announced on instagram a while back and I've been a returning customer ever since!"}
{"text":"I love crepes and order them quite often. The crepes at this place taste pretty good, however the service was disappointing. My husband and I didn't feel welcomed and probably won't return."}
{"text":"The Crepe Club is located right in the middle of the Biltmore shopping center, the decorations were Valentine's Day theme.  The decorations were actually very pleasant to look at..    Food; ordered a Crepe with Nutella and Strawberries, which was mighty tasty.  The crepe was a hair bit thicker than usual but still delicious.  Standard price included Nutella, each additional toping was $1.00 extra..  Service;  The Young lady working behind the counter was super friendly, and really was trying hard to satisfy all customers entering.  Upon entering it was a bit dirty, my first assumption was that the lunch rush just left but not sure that was the reason after our visit.  When we went to order, the lovely Young Lady and a Gentlemen was working the counter, ordered our crepes and soft drinks.  We never were handed our cups for our drinks, so we walked to the drink bar assuming that maybe the cups were located there.  Their was a cups located, so assumed these were our drink cups after going around the drink station looking for lids, another employee who appeared to be doing the bookkeeping finally asked me what I was looking for,  learned that we were never given our drink cups and the cups we were using were water cups.  While sitting eating I noticed that the Lovely Lady was the only one working, it appears the gentlemen and additional Lady were not assisting her, nor trying to clean the place or restock the drink station. After we were done eating, I asked for a lid for our drink cups, sadly I was given a lip that does not fit my cup.  At this point the Young Lady was getting busy, all the while the two other employees were not helping her out.  Upon leaving, I asked this poor Girl if she was the only one working, and if everyone else is on break.  Her reply was hilarious and wont repeat, but basically from what I gather she just came on her shift to a dirty store."}
{"text":"Discovered this place a couple weeks ago whilst shopping around the Biltmore. I'm a big fan of French cuisine (especially desserts) so I figured, why not give it a try! This place is quaint and tucked away. Apparently it's new to the complex, too. The staff there is really friendly and outgoing. The two gentlemen behind the counter, Michael and David, seem like they really enjoy their jobs and that's what I personally look for in a café/restaurant. I like visibly seeing coworkers get along with eachother while being happy to make sure everything is good for the guests walking in. If anything, I say go with the strawberry crêpe. Beware: it's filling. It's probably best to split with someone.    (Let it be known, that the people that decided to write a lengthy novel about this place (and seriously all places in general) clearly have a lot of idle time on their hands and love to bitch whenever they can. I'm sure most haven't worked a single day in restaurant/hospitality. Suggestion? Don't go off of that. Come in and just decide for yourself. Because Newsflash: we know your secret; You like to go on Yelp with your little smartphones and act like a superior restaurant critic. Well, This isn't Hell's Kitchen, and you're not Gordon Ramsay. Don't quit your day job. If you're using Yelp just for the sole purpose to taint the reputation of a small business that people work hard to maintain and put together, you need something called a \"hobby\")"}
{"text":"Hidden gem for them busy weekend mornings. The kinder crepe was amazing. Friendly and efficient staff."}
{"text":"If I could I would go into the negative numbers. I wanted to take my wife out for a nice lunch, and she loves Crepes. Me, not such a fan, but she loves them. I thought I'd go for the Quiche. Nope they ran out of quiche. Ok, so I go for the turkey and Swiss. We also order two Lattes. I go to pay and give them a $100 bill. They can't change that. I'm ok with that, so I give two twenties. They can't change that either and the cashier starts asking the other staff if they have any dollars on them. Then I'm told their out of turkey. I'm done. Cancel my order. Now the cashier has to do some basic math to figure out how much she has to give me. OMG!!!!  So I go out and gets dog from Short Leash which is right across. BTW great dogs. I get my dog and go back to sit with my wife. She is still waiting, not even her coffee. So we wait. I eat my dog. Now I'm done. My wife is still waiting. Finally they bring the coffee. It's wrong. It's not done very well either. We wait longer and finally my wife has had it. We cancel our order, get our money back and leave. What was meant to be a pleasant afternoon lunch became one of the most aggravating dining experiences I can remember in a long time. This place should be ashamed and should reconsider being in the restaurant business. Avoid this place at all cost. There are so many good places to eat. And if you want crepes, just make them yourself. It isn't that hard."}
{"text":"It was my first time checking this place out after dinner with my fiancee. We tried the sweet crepes in the menu. It was actually decently good. The crepe was fluffy and savory. Definitely enjoyed every bite.   The place was small but very fancy. In the middle back of the room they have a small bar set up that you can help yourself out with the drinks. Their menu however seemed limited and not that much choices to chose from but maybe they'll expand the menu overtime. We only tried the sweet crepes so I still have yet to find out if the other crepes in the menu are any good. Will come back though to give it a try.   You can however order the crepes plain with no toppings if you so choose to buy your own toppings and make it your own combination on your own time. Based on what I was told it would probably cost between $4 to $5 for a plain crepe but definitely double check with them to be sure.   The only thing unfortunate about my first visit to this place was it turned out to be one of their busy weekend (Saturday). So, we did waited for quite sometime for one order.   The employees however were very friendly and nice.   Check this place out if you happen to be around the area and see for yourself."}
{"text":"I met my AOB buddy S here. I haven't been to the Biltmore in a few years so I figured what the heck. When we walked in we were greeted by Conner. He told us we could sit anywhere we liked. S and I found a good spot and Conner followed us to get our drink order. He mentioned that you normally order at the counter but I guess since the dining room was not very busy he offered us table service. Let me start off by saying Conner was awesome. He was genuine, polite, and made appropriate small talk when necessary. He talked with us for a moment about the menu and then went to fetch our Iced Teas ($2.95ea). The dining space is small but they manage to have quite a few tables, both 2 & 4 tops available. Straight back you'll find the self-serve drink bar. When you need a refill of tea or lemonade, just get up and get it yourself. The beverage bar area was clean and it appeared everyone using it was being respectful of this area. The inside is very quaint. I would imagine, however, that with the spacing of the tables if the place was packed it would be quite noisy. The Crepe Club obviously has Crepes, savory and sweet. They also offer Quiches, Croissants and Croissant French Toast, Paninis, Sandwiches, an Acai Bowl and Salads. The beverages consist of Pressed Juices, Shakes, sodas, Coffee with various incarnations, Iced Tea and Lemonade. I feel the pricing is very good EXCEPT for the Iced Tea ($2.95). It's a buck more than soda. Not sure why.  S & I decided to each order something different, split it, and then order and split a sweet crepe for dessert. S ordered the Chicken Florentine Crepe ($8.95). The filling consists of grilled Chicken, sauteed Mushrooms, Spinach, Mozzarella, and Bechamel Sauce. The flavor was good. The crepe itself was a bit thick, about 1.5X what I was expecting. I ordered the Turkey & Swiss Croissant ($8.95). Turkey, Avocado, Basil Mayo, Lettuce & Tomato. The Croissant was good but not as flakey as I feel it should have been. The carved Turkey was not dry and had good flavor. Unlike the crepe, I feel the amount of filling in the Croissant was a bit lacking. We asked Conner to choose a sweet Crepe for us. He brought us the S'Mores Nutella ($7.95). Filled with Marshmellow and topped with Nutella and Biscoff crumbles, ours seemed to be filled with something more along the lines of Marshmellow foam and again, the crepe itself was a bit thick. The flavors were good however and it was actually quite enjoyable. Having a cute place to eat at the Biltmore that charges between $6 & $9 for most of their items is amazing. It may not be exactly like a crepe you had in France but The Crepe Club does offer a great value. As a bonus, you can get a small version every crepe for a little more than half the price of the regular. Add a scoop of ice cream for a buck and you'll have a perfect desert for any occasion.  Great Staff. Cute Place. Good Food. Fair Pricing. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"It was ok.  Crepe was thick and cold. Cheese inside wasn't melted.  Not in any hurry to go back."}
{"text":"Ugh here we go.. this is my second time ordering from crepe club through Postmates. Both times big let down. I order through Postmates several times a week and rarely ever have any issues so I know it's nothing they could of prevented unless the drivers start sampling the food and drinks before delivery. I ordered the regular chicken florentine - crepe was cold, doughy and undercooked. It was generously stuffed, almost too much. Spinach was fresh, but not cooked so it was like eating a salad in my crepe...the mushrooms, clearly were canned precooked mushrooms. I'm not totally offended by them, but when you put a ton in a raw crepe...not really tasty. Iced latte- there is no option to NOT add flavoring which is baffling in itself. Flavoring should be a option not a requirement. Given I can't stand sugar filled syrup pretending to be caramel in my coffee, in the special notes section, I specifically asked NO flavoring, and add a extra shot. Guess who got a caramel syrup latte?  This girl. Why even have the special requests field if you aren't going to read it? This happened the first time I ordered. I don't know if they can't see the notes or figure it can be put on Postmates. It's all very confusing. Chocolate croissant- tasty, seemed fresh. Nothing special but compared to my $10 crepe and watered down overly flavored latte it shined.  Dear management, read your reviews. Common theme, crepes are undercooked. If you are going to be so bold to name your establishment after a certain food, you best knock it out of the park. IHOP makes a better chicken Florentine crepe. That's shameful. I gave it two shots both were overpriced let downs. Their space can't seem to keep a business longer than 2 years. I'll be shocked if they stick around."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Super cute for a girls days brunch. Or any occasion really. Their crepes were delicious, I also had a turkey croissant that was also good and the side salad it comes with has a tasty dressing. They have a self served drink area the coffee there wasn't as strong as I like itI'm assuming you have to ask for it yourself when you order your food for a stronger one because the server did mention that the self severed was not too strong . The service was great and fast. Prices were very affordable."}
{"text":"The first time I ordered delivery my order was extremely messed up. I'm not one to complain because it was still despite missing most of the ingredients it says it comes with. Just got it again and wow. Very impressed. The banana shake and Nutella crepes are amazing. It lasted all of about 10mins."}
{"text":"Don't order anything other than the Creps.  Everything else is too over priced for the microwave quality food.  You are safe with the crep because the girl makes it in front of u and it made to order.  Oh and their juices suck too.  The orange juice had a hint of rotten.   Don't even ask how much I paid for that, you'd call me stupid."}
{"text":"Yummy! We were sad that the Gilbert location closed because it was close to home. Drove about 30min to this location and it was worth the trip. Located in mall with tons of restaurants and shops. Decor is gorgeous and tons of seating. The place was packed on a Friday night. We'll plan better next time we make the drive, dinner and crepes to top the night off."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm not huge on crepes nor do I have a sweet tooth like my family but I will say this place is fantastic.   We were at the outdoor mall doing some Christmas shopping and had lunch at Johnny Rockets. My husband wanted something sweet after lunch so he went in and ordered. I walked in as he was waiting for his order and it smelt so yummy. He ordered the s'mores crepe. My husband kept saying how good it was so I needed to have a bite. To my surprise it was not over-sweet and it was so good I needed a second bite.   We are doing pictures with Santa this week so I know I'll be stopping in for a treat after."}
{"text":"Finally a fun desert place!  Crepes are made well fresh and fluffy. The smores was A-mazing and decadent. The strawberry shortcake was good but ask for some Nutella on it because it is a bit dry....would be perfect with some strawberry compote.   Where they lack in selection they make up for in service and taste. Hoping to see if they add some more selections to the menu!"}
{"text":"I'm generally not a big fan of crepes, but these were good!  We had the nutella crepe.  The nutella was nice and warm and gooey.  We wanted to try the smores crepe, but they were out.  I'd be interested to see how their savory crepes taste!"}
{"text":"Interesting little spot in the Biltmore. They serve everything from salads quiches paninis to their traditional Savory and sweet Crepes. Definitely worth checking out if you like Crepes. Interesting atmosphere and decor with a friendly helpful staff."}
{"text":"Pretty decent for a drop in crepe place.  I had the chicken Florentine crepe which was very good.  What was exceptional was their Nutella dessert crepe.  To die for!  Since it is right by the movie theater it would be a great drop-in dessert place.  I would go there again to try some other crepes"}
{"text":"I am so glad that I stopped by at this The Crepe Club since the crepes from the Phoenix Public Market were sold out!   I decided to give it a try and I was pleased to see so many crepes option to try!!!  I have egg and cheese croissant sandwich with a side spring mix salad and regular size of Nutella s'more crepes with additional banana on top on it.  This cafe is very chic and so French.   I will come back again!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from here and decided to try it to go. Ordered the dulce de leche crepe with ice cream. The crepe was good no complaint there but the ice cream...$1 extra for \"scoop of ice cream\" not sure what the consider a scoop but it was in a little to go salsa plastic container. Pretty much sample size. Suggestion to up the scoop size or lower cost."}
{"text":"The service was great and the crepe was delicious. Also service yummy lattes. Glad we found this place. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow. Where do I start with this ? Maybe the inflated prices for what you get in return. Cardboard plates and plastic cutlery with sub-par crepes eaten on wobbly chairs and tables. They night have gone for the post look but this is anything but. Im a big fan of crepes so was hoping this placed delivered but unfortunately it failed. Back to the drawing board to find decent crepes that won't break the bank....Or back!"}
{"text":"I love sweet crepes over the savory ones, so I ordered their top 3 favorites. All 3 seen in this video were delicious. Not a big fan of the paper plates, but Matt, the manager, assured me that once they move over to their new location, also inside the Biltmore, they would have real plates. This is only their temporary location. That is fantastic news. Although the crepes tasted fantastic, the presentation leave something to be desired. Matt assured me that once they move to the new location, there will be a lot of changes with how the food will be plated. Overall, I love that the staff were passionate about their products. I'm convinced that once this establishment move over to their permanent location with bigger kitchen, and more dinning area for their customers that no one will leave unhappy. Keep it up guys. Stay amazing."}
{"text":"Salmon croissant, Chicken Florentine Crepe, and the Mediterranean Chicken Crepe were fab!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could say I stumbled upon this place on ASU's campus but the truth is, I saw a coworker holding a crepe that looked amazing, stopped her in the hallway, asked where she got it...and then proceeded to hunt for the location. This place is a little hard to find because it's tucked away between a few buildings. I'm new to campus but I believe it's on Tyler Mall near the McAllister Mall intersection, near the ISTB (Intrdiscip, Sc & Tech) building. It's a small little cart/food truck set up and easy to miss. I walked right past it numerous times and never even noticed it.   This place is owned by Delice Bistro, one of my favorite bakeries in Tempe. The plain sugar crepe was made fresh, warm, and delicious. The crepe itself was a little thicker than I'm used to but it also may have seemed that way because of the way it was folded into a triangle and wrapped in a to-go carrier. Because they wrap it up, you can devour it while walking across campus. Maybe all the campus walking evens out the calories...probably not but still worth it.    The very fact that ASU had a crepe stand makes it FANCY. I was lucky to find a decent sandwich or slice of pizza at my college. If you fancy and on ASU's campus check out this spot."}
{"text":"The price was great.  Good deals. The food was actually pretty good.  You get what you pay for.  My issue was cleanliness. The place was empty on a sat morning..10am.  Usually breakfast places are hopping....not so here... 1. The floor was filthy.  It needs a good scrub amd clean. 2. They handed my spiuse a dirty coffee mug. 3. The walls were dirty...you can literally see the contrasts in color to denote dirty with clean. 4. The chairs we so wobbly...accident waiting to happen. 5.  The booths were filthy. 6. The display glasses have smeared foos on them.  Gross.  Thank gos they make the food in the open publicly."}
{"text":"Very very good crepes you can't find good ones around town. We were very excited to find a place that knows how to make crepes. It's hard to find cause signs are small but it's next to wetzels pretzels."}
