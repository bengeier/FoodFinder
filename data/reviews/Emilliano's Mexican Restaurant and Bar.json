{"text":"Great food and great margaritas! Fun atmosphere too! I wish the place had more seating because sometimes it's hard to get a table! I recommend going right after work before it gets crowded!"}
{"text":"Great food and great bartenders. We frequent Emiliano's on a weekly basis and we're never disappointed. Recommend a build-your-own margarita and holy guacamole."}
{"text":"My fiance and I tried Emilianos on a whim during our trip to Pittsburgh. The food was top notch. We shared a beef chimichanga and were awed by the fresh cheese sauce and freshness of the meal. The service was extremely quick, too. We barely ordered before our food was being delivered to the table. Since we left Pittsburgh, we've been trying to find a restaurant in Michigan that compares."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! Quick service, warm chips and salsa and margaritas - what more can you ask for? Order the Choripollo tacos. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not good...store bought ingredients and had little flavor.  My dad is an eating machine and he hardly touched half of his emilianos special."}
{"text":"Safe. I know that sounds like a mediocre review, but I love knowing of places that are safe to bring anyone to, where you're confident they will leave at least content in the belly. This place is a bit run of the mill in decor. No one is going to write home about how cool it is. However, it is clean and comfortable and after two visits, I feel pretty confident in the quality of what I would call Tex-mex. There may be more \"authentic\" Mexican food on the menu, but I stuck with the burrito both times. 
The service is good, frozen margaritas are tasty, food is yummy and tummy gets filled for a reasonable price. 
I guess 5 stars would be the best, but I lived in Austin for 2 years, so my scale is skewed."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I've had in Pittsburgh. The food is awesome, margaritas are excellent, and the prices are really inexpensive. Definitely going back and recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Food was good for the price. However the wait staff wasn't the best. Drinks weren't fill in a timely manor. For a week night it was a little disappointing."}
{"text":"I am utterly addicted and in love with the cheesy goodness that are the 'Enchiladas Suizas\" (cheese only version). The chips and salsa are both homemade and delectable. We eat here at least once per week and the staff are friendly and accommodating. I would recommend, as I have lived in TX and AZ and may be a Mexican food connoisseur. Yummy Tummy! :)"}
{"text":"New restuarant and a welcome addition to the South Side neighborhood. My wife and I enjoyed their fajitas and enchiladas.  The Mexican beer selection was great.  The service was prompt and the atmosphere was good for conversation.  We were there on a weeknight which never seems to be too crowded here.  This is a quality joint that I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The margaritas are delicious. My favorite is the enchilada suiza. Also, the queso is to die for! Very creamy and cheesy. Best guac I've had in Pittsburgh so far. 

The restaurant itself is clean and they bring your food very quick. They always make sure you have plenty of chips and drinks!"}
{"text":"Good drinks and drink specials. Food is rather bland and boring compared to mad mex."}
{"text":"The queso is amazing. I love the happy hour specials. I found a hair in my fajitas which was disgusting."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Everyone is so pleasant and attentive, the food comes out hot and fast, and all the ingredients are extremely fresh. The Wholly Guacamole is made with fresh avocado and cilantro and limes right in front of you at the table and it's so cool. I get the Arroz con Pollo every time I go and it's only $6.99 on Fridays (!!!). Best Margaritas in town - go Tuesday because the Fishbowl Margs are only 5 bucks. This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food. A nice resteraunt with festive but relaxed atmosphere. Manager was very nice and professional. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I think Emiliano and I have a difference of opinion on what constitutes a burrito. I happen to think a burrito is more than just a tortilla wrapped around some shredded chicken with tomato sauce on top. Emiliano disagrees. The lunch combo is a pretty good deal, but I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times. I highly recommend looking for the \"Emiliano's Specialties\" which are marked on the menu and ordering one of those and skipping the standard Mexican Restaurant fare if you want something different or really authentic. 

Things like the cheese enchiladas and chicken fajitas are pretty pedestrian. I mean, they taste the same here as they did at most other restaurants - if that is what you are hungry for, you will be pleased. I have gotten both of those items and been completely satisfied with their quality because I haven't expected them to be better than all the others I have had. When a restaurant has a large menu, you can pretty much assume the basics aren't going to have a lot of extras going into them, you know?

If you're looking for something more authentic, the chili rellenos that are marked with the \"house specialty\" icon are really good. Their corn flour has a unique, sweet flavor that balances well with the pepper and cheese. If you're looking for something more TexMex the chicken with bacon and Monterrey Jack cheese fajitas are really tasty. The bacon is just an unexpected salty/smokey flavor that pairs well with the creamy cheese and roasted peppers and onions. 

I like their salsa, but if you don't like cilantro, you might not. I have gotten their chips warm and room temp, the warm ones were MUCH better. Also, I love that they refill the chips and salsa for free. If the first batch isn't warm, you have a second chance. 

My main reason for not giving the place 4 stars is the service, which is more hit and miss. I have gotten excellent service here when it's been packed and marginal (possibly untrained, hard to tell) service here when it's pretty empty. Last time we were there, all the tables around us received much better service because they had a different server."}
{"text":"One thing that I love about Emiliano's is the serving sizes. I am a pretty hefty eater, but I know that when I go here I will leave with a full stomach, and sometimes even some leftovers.

The prices are pretty good. Upon glancing at the menu one might think that they're a little high, but for the amount of food you get, it's a good price.

The food is also pretty good. I've never really had anything I didn't like, and I've tried the tacos, flautas, burritos, arroz con pollo and more. Then again, I've never had anything that's completely wowed me either, which is why I'm only giving it 4 stars instead of 5.  

Overall, Emiliano's is a nice restaurant with some buena comida."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Their fish tacos I would say are great and among the top three I've had. I've also had the enchiladas and tamales and they were also very good. The house salsa and chips that come free are excellent. Have started coming here fairly regularly when I'm in the area, for what it's worth."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! They have the best sangria margarita in town and very reasonable prices. The fajitas for two actually feed two!"}
{"text":"I love Emiliano's!  I've had everything from the vegetarian menu, and I've never had a bad meal.  I love the full bar and the specialty cocktails too.  The service is almost always great.  I highly recommend this restaurant if you like Tex Mex."}
{"text":"I gotta be honest, this place has a cool atmosphere, and is great for drinks and large groups, and I think that's why some people come here. To meet up and have drinks in a hip place.

I wouldn't call their food Mexican at all. It was very bland. I really don't care for spicy food whatsoever, but this place could use some. I ordered steak tacos with a side of beans and rice. The beans were runny, the rice was just boring. The steak tacos were literally steak in a taco. No cheese, lettuce, onion...nope. Just literally steak inside a taco shell. The steak itself was alright, but there was nothing Mexican about it. It was (again) bland and slightly dry. 

Our server was very nice, so that's a plus.

But overall, this place bored the hell out of my taste buds."}
{"text":"We went on March 12, 2011... and we were a party of 10... 6 adults and 4 kids... we had to wait like 20 min for our table... which I guess is average for a busy night....  but we had to wait a lot for our food and constantly remind our waiter for our apettizers... I asked the waiter to please bring the kids food before.. so it was like 30 min later and the rest of the food was served like 40 min later..

I had the spicy shrimp... ok.. but not wow... Rice and beans were good.. 

Overall it is ok but more like a Tex-mex restaurant not  authentic Mexican.."}
{"text":"I received a gift card for here for Christmas and got to use it for lunch with my mom.  Despite the prices on most of the menu being more than $12, the lunch versions were very well priced, and comparable with much cheaper-tasting food and atmosphere (like Qdoba, around $8 a person including soft drink). We ended up not using the entirety of my $25 gift card, which was not what I was expecting.

We both had quesadillas, and were both extremely happy with their taste, as well as the freshly made free appetizer chips and salsa. The rice was cooked well, which is something that I've never encountered at a Mexican lower-priced restaurant before.

Our waiter was actually Mexican (authentic Mexican cuisine?), and very helpful and polite. Will definitely be going back for lunch some time."}
{"text":"I had just moved to Pittsburgh and was home sick for Mexican food, so my family and I decided to visit Emilianos. I ordered beef enchiladas, my son ordered beef tacos and we both got ground beef...yuk! The food is NOT authentic Mexican food at all. The Beans are not fresh, rice is not Mexican, no mexican ingredients! !  The service was horrible.  This is not a Mexican restaurant
Just because you free chips and salsa dont mean its good!"}
{"text":"I come here once every few months and i can honestly say i have never been disappointed and i always leave happy. 

This is Tex-Mex, they have nothing that is authentic Mexican food, so if that what your are looking for you wont find it here go to Reyna's in the Strip.  That being said as far as cheaper tex mex food, i am a fan.

The service is usually good, nice enough atmosphere, especially in the summer when u can sit outside.  Great drink specials around happy hour

I almost always get the fajita and it is really good( not that it is that hard to do) but they don't mess it up.  Things are reasonably priced and and it comes out pretty quick.

Guac is meh, stick with the free chips and salsa or get the queso"}
{"text":"I really loved my meal here.  The tacos pastor were delicious and the free chips and salsa are always welcome.  The server was great and the mango mojito I ordered was perfect (although I admittedly know nothing about mojitos).  I will be back."}
{"text":"I'm not a snob; I just know what I like. I've had Mexican food all over the world. Everyone does it their own way. So while we can diss -- rightfully so -- Chipolte for just stuffing ground beef in a tortilla and calling in \"Mexican,\" people who are actually taking care make Mexican with endless variations. I love Emiliano's. It's fresh. It's tasty. It's consistent -- no bad meals, not even once. And good beer and drink specials. And awesome, friendly service, always. Pittsburgh doesn't have a ton of good Mexican. I ate at Steel Cactus on Carson today and it sucked. Awful. The BYOB Mexican joint nearby is good but it doesn't compare to Emiliano's, which is also extraordinarily clean. A+ in my book. Because I like it. Bet you will too. If you're not some foodie snob."}
{"text":"I have gone here twice at two different times and days. I've gone on the weekend around 3 and during the weekday in the evening. It was relatively good and cheap. 

The first time I went was on a Sunday during lunch with 4 other friends. We sat outside, because the weather was nice and the street view was pretty. The service was slow even though it wasn't too crowded. Our server was friendly albeit slow. We were given free chips and salsa while we waited, but there was only a small bowl of each placed on the table . The chips were good, but too small for our group. After we had about one chip each we were out of salsa and had to ask for more. When the runner finally arrived with our food the table was almost too small for all of our stuff, but we made it work. The food was hot and looked great. Two of us got the \"Build Your Own Combo\" with one of each enchilada, burrito, rice, and sweet potato fries. I remember the others ordered the Choripollo Taco Stand, Enchiladas Suizas, and Emiliano's Fajitas. We all enjoyed our food and were very full when we finished. The rice was very good, neither overcooked nor under-cooked, and my burrito and enchilada were your standard pseudo-Mexican fare (super cheesy and yummy). My friends also enjoyed their meals and the reasonably priced mojitos and fishbowl margaritas were tasty.

My second trip there wasn't so great. It was during the weekday and before the dinner time rush so my friend and I were seated outside quickly. Our waitress was not only slow, she was also very clumsy (dropping our menus twice, spilling water and salsa, and bumping into our table). She was friendly enough and repeatedly apologized so we chalked it up to her having a bad day. Again we both got the \"Build Your Own Combo.\" I got the taco, tamale, rice, and sweet potato fries. My friend chose the taco, burrito, soup, beans ,and fries. When the food arrived I swear the plate was hotter than my entree and the cheese was barely melted. The fries were over-cooked, the tamale was too mushy and hard to eat (I literally had to force it down) and my friend said that her taco was one of the grosses she has ever had. The rice was palatable and my friend really enjoyed her soup. The waitress was so slow in bringing our checks that we decided to just pay cash to avoid waiting for her to return our cards. After this experience I have avoided going back."}
{"text":"First of all I just want to iterate that the food at this establishment was pretty good.  Now that that's out of the way I would like the management at this place was absolutely horrible (that's the main reason for the lower score).  I visited this restaurant on Cinco De Mayo and obviously this place was packed (that's understandable).  The day prior a friend of mine called to see if there was any specials going on during the day of the visit and they told her there was $4 Margaritas and $1 Dos Equis bottles.  Awesome.  Upon arriving I was told that this wasn't true (by the manager) in a very condescending manner and that another special (advertised on a chalk board outside of the restaurant) was not in effect either.  At first the manager didn't even believe that the special was advertised on the chalk board until a friend of mine actually showed him at which point the manager said the only special was $4 margaritas.  There were other points of misinformation presented that I won't go into but suffice to say that I won't ever go back here again and not on the account of the food (which was excellent) but the management."}
{"text":"The service was very good. We got our meal fast and the waitress was attentive. The combo is definitely the best deal for getting your money's worth. I got a chicken salad that was just ok, but probably my own fault for ordering a salad at a Mexican restaurant. The grilled chicken was very good though. Margaritas were fairly good, a little too sweet. I much prefer mad mex margs."}
{"text":"This place has a fun atmosphere. Staff is friendly. Food is amazing. The table side made guacamole is like a party for your taste buds. There is not a bad item on their menu. The margaritas are, lets just they sure do not skimp on the liquor and there are so many options."}
{"text":"We were seated outside and our server was also helping the hostess to seat people inside. Our server was very friendly, but because he was playing two roles of it took a long time to get drinks, our order taken, the check, etc. 

We were waiting so long to pay we ended up leaving the table and searching for our server inside. 

Other tables that arrived after we sat down, and had different servers, left before us. They also weren't particularly busy. Could've been better"}
{"text":"Beautiful and spacious. Excellent food and service. I highly recommend for you and your friends as well as family."}
{"text":"Bad service! Came here on a weeknight a few weeks ago, sat at the bar to grab a margarita after a long day, and never got greeted! Sat there for ten minutes and neither of the two bartenders ever came up to serve us. We made eye contact a few separate times with the male bartender and were still ignored... So we got up and left and took our business elsewhere. Bummed because it would've been a convenient place for dinner close to our home."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely incredible. I have been here many times and am always impressed with the food. One of my all time favorite dishes is the fajitas. I was upset when they removed the Al pastor options from their menu but everything else is so good that it didn't keep me from coming back. Also, the margaritas are to die for."}
{"text":"Cheap and consistently good Mexican food. Quick and attentive staff. Never had a bad meal. Sampler is great. Love the beans."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Will always recommend it to anyone who's looking for a delicious meal that will leave you so full! 

We started with the three dip trio with guacamole, cheese dip and pico de gallo - so yummy! Endless chips and salsa only adds to the great meal! Glass of wine and raspberry margarita.

We then ordered the fajitas (steak, shrimp, and chicken). They always come out steaming hot and are completely filled with meat and tons of veggies! This meal is pricey but so worth it. We have lots of leftovers to take home since it comes with 3 tortillas and a side salad with beans and rice! 

Overall awesome restaurant. Their appetizers are all delicious and the fajitas are such a filling and tasty meal. Would definitely recommend to anyone and everyone! Our service was great and so was our waiter, it was a nice time and we will definitely be back plenty of more times!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Prices are fair and if u get a chance, make sure you get a seat in the bar area. Bollo is the best bartender/waiter."}
{"text":"We wanted to try a traditional Mexican restaurant for the first time since moving to Pittsburgh from Phoenix.  Emilianos won the lottery!  The restaurant was open and clean.  We were seated right away at around 5:30 PM on a Saturday.  The chips and salsa were tasty (we love the traditional thin tortillas).  My wife ordered a sangria and I ordered a regular margarita.  Both were tasty and strong!  Wifey ordered Camarones Vallerta - we both loved it...especially the sauce.  I had fish tacos (I'm obsessed with them).  I was hoping for baja style (avacado, cabbage, pico, etc.), but they were just fried fish on tortillas with some side fixin's.  Overall, decent experience.  We will try again some day..."}
{"text":"Wonderful friendly service, good drinks and great food! I highly recommend the table side Holy Guacamole. It's a show and absolutely the best guacamole I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Great drink menu and specials, good service, and the food was delicious. Chips and salsa were great. I had their signature burrito with chicken and chorizo, and my boyfriend had the enchiladas suizas. Both were fantastic. We will make it a regular stop."}
{"text":"Everything is so good here! The holy guacamole is the best around! Service is really great too! My friends and I go every chance we get!"}
{"text":"Excited to try it, moved back to Pittsburgh and needed to find a go to Mexican restaurant. Unfortunately I never got my food. My wife and our friend received their meals, and every time our server came out he kept assuring me it was coming. 15 minutes after everyone else was done eating I was still told it's coming. As someone with extensive restaurant work experience, to not even have a manager come talk to us was insulting. I did have some of the table side guac, but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary or warranting me giving this place another try. Oh well."}
{"text":"The food here is great, fresh and spicy and delicious. The service is also great, there's almost never a wait and the staff are quick and kind.  Specifically, the refried beans are amazing and the veggie fajitas rock.

The poor review is for their rice being made with chicken stock even though it's listed on their menu under vegetarian. It is NOT VEGETARIAN.  

Thanks to the waitress who brought it to our attention, shame on the inconsiderate kitchen manager that decided to lie to his/her clientele. We will not be visiting here again unless they update their menu or change their recipe."}
{"text":"I love Mexican cuisine, and in my opinion, Emiliano's is just \"ok.\" The food presentation is lovely, but  the flavor was lacking for the most part. 

I will rave about their Sangria Margarita's, which are delish! 

Overall, the convenience of this location is cool, but if I have the time to go elsewhere for Mexican, I would."}
{"text":"I came here for a Spanish Meetup and ordered the Vallarta Shrimp and for dessert the Tres Leches cake. The shrimp dish was pretty good but was maybe a little too sweet. The cake on the other hand was way too sweet and otherwise could have tasted very good since I did like the flavor. 

On a more positive note, the establishment is nice and seems pretty upbeat and some of the staff speak Spanish, which is good for practice.

Overall I think this is a good place but the food didn't do it for me. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't spectacular either."}
{"text":"Vegans and vegetarians beware. Chicken stock in the rice, sausage in the black beans and butter in the refried beans! Wish we woulda stuck with mad mex. Waitress is very nice though."}
{"text":"I love Emiliano's! The food is great, portions are big! Service can he a hit or miss. Sometimes you get a great server and then sometimes they aren't the best, they are kinda rude or just don't come around that often. Prices are very reasonable! The only thing I think is ridiculous is that they charge you for extra sour cream...I know multiple places do this so it's not just Emiliano's. Emiliano's alcoholic drinks are amazing! They are so good! Their margaritas are a really good deal! You get a huge margarita for a good price especially when they have a happy hour deal. Not only do they have deals on margaritas but other drinks as well. Emiliano's is definitely a place to try when you are down South Side!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since they opened .  Always a great and polite wait staff.  Food is delicious and it usually comes out without much of a wait and steaming hot.  It does get busy during dinner hours and the weekends , but usually you can get right in.  Tv's in the bar area if you just want a giant dos Equis while watching the game.  Free chips and salsa, and they are both excellent."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, usually for lunch. The food is delicious, service is attentive/quick if you're on a time budget and the staff is friendly! (I always get the tacos!). Highly recommend this place as a go-to lunch spot."}
{"text":"I love to get the combination dinner - one or two entree items with two or three sides, from 8-12$ I think.  Everything is delicious.

Drinks aren't bad either, had a couple 2 or 3$ bottles with dinner.

Boyfriend's always asking when we can go again.  Favorite mexican food in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Food is great. Drinks are great. I usually go to take advantage of half off margaritas and mojitos. My favorite appetizer is the chorizo con queso and dish would be the chori pollo. I stay away from the pick 2, 3, or 4 meal deal as I don't feel it comes with the same quality as a regular dish. The staff is great and energetic, well at least the staff members I always run into!

Updated 07/2016 - portions are smaller than they use to be. $12.99 shrimp quesadilla had about 3 shrimp diced up with peppers and cheese, it was more like a red & yellow pepper quesadilla. 
The staff has changed over time and my visits just aren't the same as they once were. 
My friend arrived shortly after me and it took more than 15 minutes for her to be greeted and her drink order taken. The wait time for the check was in the same realm probably more towards 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Can't comment on the food because we sat for 30 minutes and not one server came to address us. If I could give zero stars I would."}
{"text":"This isn't a gourmet mexican restaurant but I think the quality of food for the price is excellant. I live in the South Side and I stop by here for happy hour at least once a month. Even if you miss the happy hour bottles of wine are REALLLY reasonable ($20-25 for decent bottles)

Note: The food is ready in about 5 minutes no matter how busy it is which is a plus for me!"}
{"text":"Free warm chips and salsa at the table while you wait for your food are a nice touch. Food is plentiful and quite authentic. Nice atmosphere, but a little noisy if the \"salsa man\" is making fresh salsa in the stone bowl near your table. Food can be mild for the timid or ramped up for the bold. Very nice and friendly staff."}
{"text":"My best friend used to work at the Emiliano's in the North Hills and didn't have great things to say about the place (namely that her paychecks repeatedly bounced) so I was sort of skeptical.  I ended up being pleasantly surprised.

There was no wait for a table for 2 at 6:00 on a Friday night.  Our waiter asked us for drinks, promptly brought them, and was great about refilling them throughout the meal.  The menu is pretty extensive, as is the drinks/dessert menu.  I was not feeling any of the vegetarian options (no cheese chiles rellenos :( ) so I did a Create Your Own Combo, as did my roommate.  I got 2 cheese enchiladas with rice and refritos ($8.49); he got a chicken burrito, a chicken enchilada, and a beef quesadilla with rice and refritos ($9.49).  We were both enjoying the free chips and salsa when the food arrived.  Almost too quickly - makes me wonder if it was pre-prepared and just microwaved.

At any rate, it was good.  There's not too much to say about cheese enchiladas, rice, and beans, but they were good.  My roommate enjoyed all his food as well.  We ordered a fried ice cream for dessert, which was very good.  Total before tip was about $28.

I really enjoyed this place - it wasn't crowded, service was really quick, and it seemed like a pretty good value.  I definitely wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"Emiliano's is a great spot for all occasions: Birthdays, Date Night, Brunch, etc. Everything we have had here has been so tasty! The service is quick and super responsive. You'll never leave hungry, instead you'll be taking home a box or two of leftovers. Great Mexican food and you can't go wrong stopping here!"}
{"text":"This is a fun little restaurant , they really care about serving you a fresh food I really love the soup and he steak hummmmm yummy  they have the right seasoning . I will stop by at this place and I'm once again in the city"}
{"text":"Winding down our last night in town, our group decided that dinner was in order, and it needed to be Mexican. After doing some Yelping, and finding that it was one of the only places open that fairly cheap, and had a diverse enough menu to cater to everyone, we decided to head to Emilianos Mexican Grill & Bar. After about a ten minute cab ride from downtown, we were ready to feast.

After arriving, we were seated promptly, and given our complimentary chips and salsa. As far as the menu goes, this place has all the standard offerings you would find at any similar Mexican restaurant, not that that is a bad thing necessarily. The food itself was pretty tasty, and I made sure to clean my plate. Is it something insanely awesome? Not really, but it does the trick.

Along with the good food and service, Emilianos was exceptionally clean, which is always a plus when dining out. If I lived in the area, I could see myself dining here a lot."}
{"text":"Ok yelp nation if you read my review if The Round Corner Cantina, or Reyna Foods taco stand, then you know that I HATE HATE HATE fake Mexican food. Despite their commercials on TV with the offensive fake Mexican accent, the food here is crap. So is the service. And the decor.  Here is the story of my latest trip. 

We will start with the decor. It was bland and boring and just rang of some gringo's idea of what Mexico looks like based on a Speedy Gonzalez cartoon. Plus the tables are so small a party of four didn't have enough room for drinks and plates; we had to hijack a nearby empty table because the plates were so huge. 

On to the service now. One big note to good service: don't be strung out when working. Our server looked like she was going to dope nod at any minute at the table. She took her merry time getting drinks (15 minutes for 2 drafts) she checked in in us maybe once. The only upside was that the food came out quickly. 

The downside to food coming out quickly is that it was all reheated from a bag. I got the sampler platter figuring I could try a large variety of offerings. Big mistake. I should have gotten one crap meal instead about six. The chicken was dry and tough. The tamale corn was soggy and gritty. The tortillas were crap. The ground beef looked like Taco Bell beef. All of it was covered in a plasticky sauce that tasted like spicy nothing. The rice was hard. The refried beans were processes and puréed to the point where they resembled something to exit a dysentery riddled newborn.  If they charged Taco Bell prices I wouldn't be as upset but this wasn't cheap either. 

To finish up Emiliano's is a stain on the name of Mexico. They know most Americans wouldn't know authentic Mexican cuisine if it walked up and punched them in the face. So they buy in a bunch of processed flavorless crap, microwave it, and send it out as \"authentic\". This place is crap. Steer clear."}
{"text":"The 3 stars is for the drinks and chips.  We went on a Saturday night and they had a $6.99 sangria margarita special and $2.50 dos Equis. I went with a beer and my date choose the margarita which I keep stealing sips from! It was huge and delicious.  Most nights they seem to have drink specials.  On a Saturday night it was busy and they do not take reservations Friday or Saturday night.  We got there early and had time to grab a drink at the bar while we waited for our table. We were seated fairly quickly but I did not realize how small it is inside.  Our waitress was fantastic!  We ordered the dip trio to go with the free chips and salsa they bring out.  This contained guacamole which was not good, a white cheese dip that was fantastic and pico de gallo which was very tasty. I was so disappointed about the guacamole. I'm glad we didn't pay the extra money to have them make it fresh tableside. For my entrée I ordered the chicken quesadilla which was not good at all.  I don't like when they use shredded chicken and it had no flavor.  Others in our party ordered the enchiladas and fajitas and were happy with them."}
{"text":"The food was really good, and so was the service. I would have given them 5 stars if I hadn't gotten ridiculously sick from their food. I'm never going back here again."}
{"text":"I met a group of ladies on Monday at Emilliano's Mexican restaurant in McCandless Crossing.
I had the most delicious lunch for only $8.29.  I ordered their Arroz Con Pollo.  It consists
of a lot of marinated chicken strips and sauteed onions, bell peppers and mushrooms which
is served over rice.  It is topped with a special cheese sauce and sour cream.  There was
enough for two people.  The $8.29 also included a small salad with a lime/cilantro dressing.
The next time you go to Emilliano's for lunch, try this.  You will love it!  Can't wait to return.
J. Wenzel"}
{"text":"Emilianos's... Where to begin? The atmosphere is incredibly friendly. The staff make you feel like part of the family. Bollo, Gabriel, Nina, Melissa, Lisa, Ingrid... It doesn't matter who you have, they will make you feel at home. And the food? I've had everything on the menu, and I've never been anything less than amazed. A perfect blend of traditional Mexican food and Tex Mex, Emilianos is top of its class. Let's not forget their drinks, though. Their fabled margaritas were not declared Pittsburgh's best without reason. Their homemade mix is paired with a generous helping of silver tequila. If you're feeling particularly ambitious, try their sangria margarita (also made in house). Every day gives you the chance to try something new, with a daily drink special that undercuts most other restaurants by a few valuable dollars. Overall, 150/10!! I can't wait to go back tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day, for more!"}
{"text":"Service was pretty bad. The server never refilled our ships until we asked. And took away salsa before we were done. We ordered chili con queso and there was no queso. It was just very bad. We were never asked if food was okay or if we were okay. It just seems like we weren't wanted there and they weren't closing for two hours."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, quiet table (except for the sombrero happy birthday song at the next table) and easy $4 parking a block away at the parking garage. My Super Steak Burrito was a bit chewy at times but it was tasty and I enjoyed it.  $2.29 for a small side of refried beans seemed high but I never asked the price before ordering."}
{"text":"Had burrito rancheros. Meat was cooked perfectly. Rice was quite good. Overall it was a good meal.
 Good atmosphere. Recommended."}
{"text":"Not great. Not terrible. Honestly I thought everything about this place was just average and mostly forgettable. Pretty indifferent about it."}
{"text":"For the price, the food is bland and tasteless.  There is nothing mexican about this place.  Even the margaritas suck.  Also, they put taco loco out of business.  

Screw you emilianos."}
{"text":"I tried this location versus the one in cranberry... I can't say the food was very different which I thoroughly enjoy, however, I could've done without the hair that was in my chicken quesadilla. Blah...gross."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! They immediately bring chips with your drinks, yum! We always get California burritos- choripollo (chorizo chicken). It's probably big enough for my husband and I each get our own so we can take some home. We loooove chorizo! Staff is always friendly and we've never had any issues."}
{"text":"Best part was the cheese dip and the iced tea. Food is definitely tex-mex and needed some seasoning. Regular guac is seriously lacking -- we didn't do the table side. Beans were lacking in flavor.

We went on a Sunday night and definitely got Sunday night service -- very slow!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars. The food was terrible and the service was seriously lacking.  My order arrived missing a taco I ordered.  No one came to check on us to see how our meals were.  My husband had to hunt down the waiter to find out about the missing taco.  Suddenly, a cold taco mysteriously arrived.  Come to think of it, all of the food was lukewarm.  The ONLY thing that arrived quickly was the check.  NEVER again.  

The waiter did not come check on us until I got up to get a manager.   Needless to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Okay, so I have to say that I expected subpar generic Mexican food. However, I was happily surprised to find that there were some authentic Mexican dishes. I was also very happy with the extra spicy salsa that was given to me after I requested something hotter than the normal salsa that they give to all tables. Good salsa provides the basis for all good Mexican food in my book. Most of the other food was average American / Mexican, but with half price draft beers, appetizers, and margaritas during happy hour who can complain? Their desserts were also pretty good. I guess I would say it's better than Mad Max but not as good as Los  Cabos or Verde ."}
{"text":"Good Americanized Mexican food. Some of the best nachos in Pittsburgh (my boyfriend and I LOVE our nachos)! It's hard not to fill up on the free (bottomless) chips and salsa. We would usually split an order of the nachos and be comfortably satisfied. You will definitely have leftovers if you get an appetizer and entrees. Big portions, average entrees, decent drinks (margaritas)."}
{"text":"Located in the South Side, Emiliano's has the best Mexican food in Pittsburgh. 

If you aren't on for parallel parking you can use the garage near by in the South Side works. If you're brave try the street parking out front. You'll be greeted by friendly staff upon arrival.

The chips and salsa are complimentary, but don't forgot the guacamole. It's amazing! I always order the chorripollo tacos. Hands down the best thing on the menu. Portion sizes are huge! The drinks are also over the top with all kinds of frozen and mixed cocktails. 

You will not go wrong with a stop here!"}
{"text":"Every time I walk by this place, I see a huge crowd waiting to be seated. Out of curiosity once day I decided to give this place a try. I do love Mexican food. Emiliano's is pretty spacious inside and the service was great! They told us a 30 minute wait, but we were seated within 10 minutes. 

I started off with the Trio dip, which came with guacamole, white cheese sauce and pico de gallo. The chips were warm and crispy and the dips were fresh. For my main entrée, I ordered the Chimichanga with beef, which came with a side of rice and lettuce/pico. I wasn't very impressed with the chimichanga or the side of rice. It was pretty much pieces of beef inside a burrito that was tossed into the deep fryer. The meat was really dry and kind of lacking in flavors and spices. The side of rice was too mushy. 

Overall, I thought the food at Emiliano's was okay. I feel like I have had better Mexican food. Nothing I tasted here really captivated my taste buds. Prices are reasonable. I do have one major complaint though: SLIPPERY BATHROOM!"}
{"text":"Loved it. For more authentic cuisine choose the food marked with a star. The waiter we had was fantastic."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food for a great price! Never had anything that I didn't like. Their combo entree options allow you to get a few different types of food so you don't need to choose one. The table side guacamole is delicious and they let you add the ingredients you like and the amount you want. Also, their margaritas are fantastic and a good size for the price. Staff is attentive and nice. If you're looking for good Mexican in the city, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Cheese enchiladas, beans, and rice were good. Loved the chips and salsa. However, I've been there twice and they've messed up the order both times. They forgot to bring waters, i reminded them, and they didn't bring them until i was almost done eating. And this was all at a time when they weren't busy."}
{"text":"I LOVE Emiliano's! I have been there a handful of times and every time has been a great experience. I consider this an upscale Mexican restaurant. The food is great. Margaria's are great. Service is great. A+ in my book"}
{"text":"I find this is a chili's with a different name. Don't get me wrong it's good Tex Mex but not true Mexican. The food is good and hits the spot but it's nothing special. That being said I enjoyed my Fajita Texana. That was loaded with onions and meat. My mojito was also good. The price is fair and the food is good. The best thing about the place is that they have outdoor seating and the sun shines on that side of the street until sunset, so on a nice day it's worth just going to sit outside with chips and a beer. Worth a try if your hungry and walking around south side and not in the mood for bar food."}
{"text":"Free chips and  salsa which is always great while you wait for food and drinks. They have a special drink of the day outside of happy hour. 

We did have to wait a little bit longer to get our food; even though, the restaurant was fairly empty. 

However, the mimosa special 3 for 11 was very good ! My boyfriend had the house Marg that was on special. The food was hot and very delicious. We both had fajitas. You only get 3 tortilla but if you load them up, it works out !"}
{"text":"Food was very good and would go back if there was better service. It took forever to get our drinks we practically ate all the chips before our drinks came out. The food came out pretty quick it was just our waiter was not on it and took forever.  I can find other Mexican restaurants with food just as good but better service."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food with right choice of spices and sauces. Very helpful and courteous staff with great customer service. I would recommend to anyone who's willing to try some new mexican food. I tried their salad and sea food. Not to forget they have good ambiance. Our waitress was from Columbia and she was very sweet and helpful."}
{"text":"Pretty much what you'd expect as far as Mexican food goes. I liked their mojitos but I didn't taste any alcohol at all. Though my friend and I agreed they were delicious, we both had different ones, we felt like it was basically high end koolaid. We had 7 people and went for an early dinner on Saturday and it was relatively empty inside. Service was good, food came out fast and fresh. Place itself was clean and festive. I'd return and perhaps try the margarita for more bang for my buck, if you know what I mean!"}
{"text":"Decent food @ a decent price. Service was fast & attentive. Enjoyed the choripollo tacos w/ pico de gallo & chili/tomatilla sauce. Spicy!!! Gf ordered the chicken tortilla grilled sandwich- more of a \"loaded\" quesadilla w/ guac & cheese on top and she liked it. A nice alternative to southside chains."}
{"text":"I've been to this location multiple times and never have a complaint. The food is always good and the service is great. Bollo is my favorite bartender!! Their signature margarita are a must!"}
{"text":"I came here with my husband and some other family and was thoroughly disappointed. The 5 of us were brought 1 small bowl of chips and no refill ever came despite the fact that it was empty 60 seconds after our arrival. We ordered margaritas, which were just okay, and then our food came. I got a chimichanga with ranchero sauce, which was just disgusting. The beef inside was chopped up in little squares, which I've never seen before. The ranchero sauce tasted more like chipotle tobasco, and after one bite I decided that I couldn't take another. I told our waiter, and he took the plate away and brought me a bowl of bean soup. I thought to myself, how can you mess bean soup up!? And Emiliano's answered my question promptly. The soup was legitimately just half a can of black beans poured into a bowl with some cheese sprinkled on top. I was so shocked. This I ate without complaining merely because I didn't want to hold up the others who were eating with me. Maybe because I'm from Texas I have higher standards for tex-mex/Mexican food, but this was worse than Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Our waiter (short chubby young boy) took 20 minutes to get us our check, we were outside and we saw him inside talking and laughing socializing with guests rather than get us our checks. We're here to enjoy our dinner and have a good experience nice not waste our time so you can get dates. Terrible waiter and we will never come again."}
{"text":"One star off for not being authentic mexican food. It's like the Applebee's / Chili's of Mexican food. 
One star off for how long the food took to come out. Everyone at our table had a margarita and ate all the chips, we were too full for the actual food when it came!

They have a build your own plate option, which is cheaper than other plates, where you can get more variety, but the portions are smaller than the normal named entrees. 

They don't have shredded beef, sadly, just ground beef. 

The servers were super diligent, polite, attentive. The cooks just took forever."}
{"text":"I must say I have never had a bad meal here ever! In my expereinces with Emilliano's I do not ever remember the wait time being that long at all. Everything I have had hear was fantastic, I would certainly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I ordered sopapilla for carry out a few weeks ago. It somehow took 20 minutes for Emiliano's to make this single dish. Having paid a little over 6 dollars for a dessert you'd expect something of decent size, however we were given 7 sopapilla that appeared to be tortilla chips rather than the fried dough you might expect. That along with a small side of whipped cream left me less than satisfied. After driving home and then noticing this, I actually decided that it was worth driving back because the dessert was so poor. My money was refunded, but it still wasted an hour of my time. I'd at least avoid ordering any desserts from this restaurant, and check your carry outs before you leave!"}
{"text":"The guacamole is a must get, and pay attention to the drink specials. The blue Margarita is delicious and also killer. Split a few meals and you'll be happy with te results - the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"Don Pablos may have closed down in Monroeville and reopened on the Southside.  I don't feel or taste anything authentic.  It's just a very, very ordinary meal at an ordinary place.  I had the most ordinary taco that I have ever had."}
{"text":"The queso fundido appetizer is one of my favorite dishes on this planet. I always leave Emiliano's uncomfortably stuffed (in a good way) because the food is so flavorful and portions are generous. I usually get something off the seafood portion of the menu and I'm never disappointed. if you're with a group, get a margarita pitcher instead of individual drinks  to save a few bucks.

My servers have always been pleasant and attentive, and the free chips and salsa are obviously a bonus as well."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Didn't like enchilada sauce. Rice was toasted and pieces were very hard. Finding a hair in my dinner didn't help any either!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night with my husband. We waited for about 20 minutes for a table, which isn't bad. Our waitress was really nice and brought out our drinks right away. I had the fish bowl margarita and added a Corona to it and it was really good. The food came out quickly. We ordered carne asada and flautas and everything was delicious. I want to try going there again before I give this place another star because so far this is the best Mexican restaurant I've been to in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Mexican restaurant. Nothing really stands out about this restaurant, except the pollo con arroz (spelling?) which is a chicken, rice, and veggie dish with a cheese and sour cream sauce. Not light on calories, but it has a really good flavor and I haven't seen a similar dish at any other Mexican restaurants. Service is just ok, during busy weekend times it's difficult to get drink refills or even just the bill. Typically has a shorter wait time than the other popular restaurants in southside (cheesecake factory hofbrahaus, etc.) So it's a good place to eat before catching a movie."}
{"text":"First time I have been in the Southside Works in forever. Stopped down to see a movie and decided to stay for a ute to eat after. Roamed along and found this place. I would say typical Mexican restaurant. 
Decor looked a little like a cross between lower end dining of Chipotle and higher end restaurant. Service was friendly and quick. There is outside seating but none available when we stopped. Would be nice to sit outside. 
Beer and margarita specials.
We ordered guacamole which is made to order table side. A little on the pricey end with 9.99, but it is pretty big and chips are complimentary. Very good guacamole! I could probably have eaten this and the chips and salsa for me meal. 
I ordered the chimichanga cancun which is with shrimp and their cheese sauce. This was really good and huge. Comes with rice and fresh lettuce, pico de gallo, sour cream. I took more than half of this home. Friends had same and chicken chimichanga. All was really good. Priced fairly for portions and the service was excellent. Place was very busy. 
All in all it was decent Mexican food. Don't eat beforehand as you'll be stuffed when you are finished."}
{"text":"An authentic Mexican place. A lot like joints in el paso."}
{"text":"Emiliano's is a typical Pittsburgh Mexican restaurant. The food is mediocre and so are the drinks. It doesn't taste authentic and nothing is that impressive. Food lacks flavor and is typically disappointing. Cocktails are too sweet, but some can be purchased for $5 during happy hour.

You probably won't get sick if you eat here, but there are a lot of better options if you're in Southside. Heck, there are a lot of other Mexican options, or even American places where you could get a better quesadilla or nachos."}
{"text":"I went to Emiliano's for happy hour on Thursday. The food was good I got a quesadilla. They have good happy hour specials on drinks. We choose to sit outside because of the good weather. The serve however was pretty bad. Our waitress never came back to our table and we had to ask an server to get more drinks twice"}
{"text":"This is probably my best mexican restaurant ever in town. I love this guys and their food. There is a guy workin here name is \"Bollo\", he is the best server ever. He take care of everything and smile always. Love you guys"}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh! First of all, you get free chips and salsa at lunch and dinner, which is a huge bonus and the chips are fresh/hot with a unique and flavorful salsa (unlimited refills).

I usually ordered the steak fajitas - the meat was grilled to perfection and very tender and the fajitas exactly how they should be with the right amount of seasoning, served piping hot and in a timely fashion.

Occasionally, the service could have been a little faster and the guacamole is slightly bland but overall this was my go-to spot for a good, sit down Mexican meal in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Food!  If u like Mexican, this is about the best in the Burgh.  If u come here, ask for Edgar!"}
{"text":"I love Emilianos! I have yet to be disappointed there. Service here is always very friendly and quick. Tableside guac is always exceptional as well as the queso fundido. Regular queso is also just as yummy! Who doesn't love cheese?! 

I usually will stick to Arroz con pollo which never lets me down. Always perfectly made and comes out super quick. If I feel like dessert I will order the Tres Leches Cake which is simple phenomenal. I am usually a big chocolate girl, but this cake is unlike any other cake or dessert I have had. Sweet and creamy!"}
{"text":"I live Emiliano's. Their guacamole is among some of my favorites.  I had the carnitas street tacos last night and the house made hot sauce that comes with them is out of this world!"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous. Happy Cinco de Mayo! Come early and ready to wait. Trust me- its worth it. First and foremost the entire staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating.. Allowing us to come inside when it got dark/cold. the servers hand-make their own drinks, which are strong an delicious! We sampled the margarita, sangria, daiquiri, and mojitos. 

As soon as we sat down, they delivered homemade nachos and perfect salsa- fresh & spicy!! Our server, Edgar, recommended the enchilada suiza which was amazing and cheesy and oh, so, good! Truly authentic and great-tasting food. And a very enjoyable experience. We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Emiliano's is a place I can see myself going a lot. I needed a relatively cheap, laid-back restaurant to take my date, and it fit the criteria perfectly. 

The good: 

Free chips and salsa, keeps your mind off waiting for your food, and the fresh chips and salsa were excellent. 

Excellent service. My waiter was always bringing me more tea, without asking, and kept out chip basket filled. We also were just conversing about an unidentified yellow cube on my date's plate, and a passing waitress let us know that it was mango, asked us if we needed anything, and let us be again.

Portions were more than enough. I missed lunch, and between the chips and my entree I left stuffed, and I'm a bigger guy. Also, entrees are around $12-15, appetizers are about $4 for bean dip, cheese dip, or guacamole (which was very good) and $6-8 for other typical appetizers. The price was definitely fair, but I wouldn't say it was a steal either.

I had an excellent chicken and veggies over rice dish (something con pollo), and would recommend it. Very crisp vegetable tastes that still blended with the cheese sauce and sour cream. I loved every bite. My date got the appetizer quesadillas, and said they weren't anything special, and the bite I took of them confirmed this. 

The bad: 

The atmosphere is laid back, especially for the two seat tables. The booths looked cozy though. It's a nice place to take a girl if you're not looking for anything too serious, just a quick bite and a movie.

The menu seems kind of inaccessible, so if you're bringing a group or date that's not up to snuff on the cuisine terms, you'll have to do a bit of explaining.

The prices were right on, expect to get what to pay for, but not much more.

Overall a good place to grab a bite, and I'd recommend it to a friend, so it's gotten my nod of approval."}
{"text":"I've now been to Emiliano's twice, and have yet to be seriously disappointed.  It's no Mad Mex, but the food is decent, the atmosphere festive and the service friendly.    We arrived to a packed house at 6:45 on Saturday night and began the meal with Emilianos' signature chips and salsa - really decent and a nice way to start the evening.  Between our group of four we tried seafood fajitas, a pork burrito with sweet potato fries, the chicken quesadilla and something I forget and/or can't identify with red sauce. Personally, I think my fajitas were the best choice of the night, but that's just me.  A little on the oily side, but generally hot, fresh and plentiful with a full complement of mexican rice and guacamole salad.  3 stars, since I think \"decent\" isn't an ideal way to feel about food and the price is higher than Mad Mex for lesser quality.  But hey, Emiliano's truly is A-OK and I'll probably go back again.  Olé!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican-American restaurants with consistent salsa and complimentary chips. Try the chori-queso in addition to your complimentary salsa."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for Mexican food! I've never been disappointed with anything...food, drinks, service...it's always fantastic! 
The Holy Guacamole can't be beat,  and they will make it as hot or mild as you want it at your table. Everything is fresh and cooked perfectly! 
I also love that they have more than one kind of Dos Equis on draft!"}
{"text":"I ordered Shrimp fajitas. The shrimp were plump and juicy and the dish had a lot of kick to it.  The food is fun and festive and the margaritas are served blended. They have a huge margarita machine cranking behind the bar. Emilianos has an upbeat and festive atmosphere. I think it fits perfectly in the South Side works.The menu is your standard Mexican fair, enchiladas, burritos, Chimichangas. One of the more creative dishes I've tried was the Camarones Cobijados seasoned shrimp wrapped in bacon
This place is fun for dates the wait staff is personable and they also have a full bar."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are good here, but I'd give the food a solid \"meh.\""}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday and was promptly seated.

It's a spacious restaurant with good drink and lunch specials. You can't go wrong with complimentary fresh chips and salsa!

I had the fish tacos lunch special and it was pretty good! Their margaritas frozen or on the rocks are delish and reasonably priced as well. 

It's decent mexican food but not the best i've had but a great lunch option for work!"}
{"text":"We had a great night here! The prices are really reasonable, good service, and delicious food. We really enjoyed the fundido queso dip, it was made table side and really yummy!"}
{"text":"Pretty average except for the guacamole. I would come here for that in a heartbeat. As for the tacos? I'll go to Qdoba instead."}
{"text":"Emiliano's was authentic Mexican food to me when I was 16 and didn't know any better. Now, 9 years & a lot of tacos, quesadillas & fajitas later- I can tell you that this place is pretty mediocre. Sure, it's not terrible- but it's not going to blow you away. On my most recent trip, my family and I all order a margarita to start. It was good- but nothing different or special. The presentation wasn't anything different & I had no desire to order another. The chips & salsa were good- Probably my favorite item of the evening. I ordered the steak fajitas for dinner. The chicken & steak fajitas were both $14, so I figured I would go for the steak. They were good- but not great. Nothing memorable. If I want Mexican, this is the absolute last place in Southside that I am going to visit- there are more authentic & less commercial places on East Carson & their prices are a lot better as well."}
{"text":"We are still looking for a favorite Mexican restaurant here Pittsburgh. We think we may have found it at Emilliano's. They serve a red tortilla soup with lots of chicken it's very delicious. And the lunch service here is fast and the plates are served very hot. The shrimp Chimichanga was great. The enchiladas supreme are also good. We will be coming here often."}
{"text":"Their guacamole will leave you speechless! I ordered the full size portion and they brought out all the fresh ingredients and made it right in front of me.

Overall their food is pretty standard and what you expect from a Mexican restaurant. 

They have great drink specials around happy hour so I definitely recommend taking advantage of them to unwind from work. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yeeeeah. This place was okay. Unfortunately for them, I loooove Mexican food and this was my first fix in months. So from lack of delicious Mexican food, my standards had risen. Sure, they have free chips and salsa. That's standard, right? I though the service was a little slow once the check was dropped, but will say, for lunch, the price and quickness of the food was decent. It may have had something to do with the fact that there was only 2 other people in the place. I've had better, but don't know where in Pittsburgh. Anyone? Hello? Is this thing on?"}
{"text":"Went with a friend for a late lunch because we were shopping in the area. Very convenient to a great shopping area (we were hitting up REI and Sur La Table).

Although the location is great, the food was mediocre. We both got the Enchiladas Supreme, which we read were good. Basically, you get two small enchiladas (one chicken, one beef), rice, and a \"salad.\" I put salad in quotation marks because it was basically iceberg lettuce with a little tomato salsa and some shredded cheese sprinkled on top. They could definitely work on making that more of a side dish and not an afterthought. The rice was good though, and there are free chips with salsa, which I thought was the best tasting part of the meal. The lunch was about $10, including tax and tip, so not a bad deal. Since they had good (and free) chips and salsa, I'm giving this place three stars, but probably will not be going back."}
{"text":"I love emilianos. They offer great food and fast processional service. I really like chips and salsa. And their queso is good to! I always go for the arroz con pollo dish. I've never been dissatisfied when I go in. They also offer takeout and usually have your food ready in 10 minutes. Take out comes with chips and salsa to! I have noticed however when I order take out the food has consistently been sub par to when I eat in  by a conderiable amount. Idk what it is but the chicken just has so much less flavor then the delicious dish I get when I eat in."}
{"text":"Great food and drink! Had the Holy Guacamole as an appetizer, Flautas for main meal and Classic Mojito to drink . Our waiter, Carlos, was pleasant and very helpful. My husband , children and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and will definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"Giant margaritas for happy hour. Everything else lacking in quality. Slushy machine behind the bar. Horrible to tequila selection. No mescal selection. Terrible beer selection. Old salsa and brown giacca.  Empty at lunch time..... I can see why"}
{"text":"This place is great. The service is always excellent. It can get pretty busy and there could be a wait, however it's well worth it. We eat here probably once or more a month. They have authentic Mexican food. The holy guacamole is amazing. The queso is amazing especially if you add something to it. Drinks flow and the meal portions are large. I highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"I've been for both lunch and dinner multiple times because of the location in the South Side. It has really delicious food, but the atmosphere is a little more corporate than most other Mexican restaurants. I think this fits the vibe of South Side Works, so it's in a good place. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely not your top of the line, quality mexican food. Being a big fan of Mexican food, I was pretty disappointed, as my craving was not fully met. It was served cool, warm at best, and the flavors were just ok. The service, however, was good. I would not go out of my way to make a trip back here."}
{"text":"I had a pretty nice time here. I live only a few blocks away, but never visited until I had a coupon for a free appetizer.

My roommate and I came later in the evening, and there was no wait to be seated. The margaritas were on special for happy hour, and even though it was only lime & rocks for the special, I got one and was pleasantly surprised. I'm not usually a fan of lime margaritas OR margaritas on the rocks, but this one was tasty, for only $3.00.

The chips and salsa were really good--the salsa was thick but not chunky--the kind I love, and the chips were crisp but not oily how they can sometimes be at restaurants.

For our free appetizer we got queso con carne. I just thought it was so-so. It tasted too much like ground beef--I guess I was expecting something that tasted more like cheesy chili. Oh well, it was free.

I got the chimichangas for my entree, and I thought they were good, nothing special, but good. I really liked the rice and beans on the side though.

Since I only live a few blocks away, I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"My Emiliano's experience was, in one word: horrific. Upon bringing the salsa and chips to our table, the waiter proceeded to dump the dish of salsa all over me, and my down jacket (it got on my suede shoes, jeans and other members of my party as well). The server was very apologetic, and I like to think that my party was understanding. After all, accidents happen to all of us. 

The waiter helped to mop the floor, and wipe down my jacket (albeit with a questionably sanitary dish rag) and apologized profusely. We asked to see the manager and explained the scenario to him. I asked that they comp the dry cleaning on my jacket, and he begrudgingly agreed. 

Our food came promptly, and was delivered by the manager. Upon handing my sister her plate, he said (under his breath): \"Don't touch the plate, it's hot. I wouldn't want to have to pay for your hospital bill too.\"  We found this a little off-putting, but tucked into our meals anyway. 

The food was mediocre at best, and both me and my sister found the retried beans to be inedible. They tasted as if they had been burnt, or had liquid smoke added to them. The flavor was overpowering, and even a healthy dose of Cholula couldn't help. As we were leaving, another waiter made a snide comment about my request to comp my dry cleaning. 

Overall, our experience at Emiliano's was disappointing. The food was just mediocre, and wasn't nearly enough to make up for the treatment of the managers and waitstaff. (For clarity's sake: our personal waiter was very apologetic and understanding of the situation). I will never return."}
{"text":"Delicious! I love everything about emillianos! The service is always so friendly and fast. The food is always fresh and yummy. The dip trio (salsa, queso, quac) is amazing. The queso is creamy and delicious, the quac as fresh as it gets. Chips and salsa are free and bottomless as well. I like that you can build your own meals, choosing the entrees and sides. The California burrito is delicious, as for the chicken burrito. The rice is my favorite, and sort of random but delicious sweet potato fries as well. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is I'm absolute hands down favorite Mexican restaurant. They have a wide variety of different tequilas and flavored margaritas. Tonight I am drinking a cucumber Hornitos marg, AMAZE I love it!! Everyone needs to eat here at least once in their life!! I have also used them for catering for parties. It was a HIT!! #goemilianos"}
{"text":"Been here with two of my friends for a dinner before getting back home towards Philly. The ambience is definitely good for either families or groups of people. I did find some seating that would've entertained single folks too - though not a lot of them.

The chips and salsa were totally a class apart. They were so freshly made and with every bite of it, I was just wanting more. To their credit, it was not overly salted.

They had a potato dish whose name I forgot. That went down well too.

My friends ordered their regular fajitas and were pretty happy about it as well. 

All in all - a highly recommended place to stop in!"}
{"text":"My friends and I met here last Friday for drinks and dinner.  The food, service and atmosphere were excellent!  We all got different dishes and everyone loved what they ordered.  Even on a busy Friday night, our food was ready in record time!  Our waiter was great, he was very attentive and kept the sangria flowing.  I loved this place so much I considered going back a few days later.  This will definitely be added to my list of favorites in the South Side."}
{"text":"Have been going there for a few years and have never had a bad meal. The servers may change but the food and drinks are always great. Love the 1/2 price margaritas on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"First time here I'm from Nashville but when I make a return trip I will come back. Presidente margarita on point Charipollo tacos on point. It's a Monday night and the bar tender is busy but attentive. I would tell my friends to visit for sure"}
{"text":"Loud most of the time.

It's annoying to go to a Mexican place and see sports channels blaring. I think the staff likes sports

The chips have no taste, flat, unsalted.....

Salsa has no color from jalapeños, cilantro or anything. Tasteless

The chicken in enchiladas is not flavored with cooked onion or tomatoes, it is just tasteless blobs of chicken. They can do much better!

You won't hear Mexican music here. Just Loud sports which ruins the food and dining for me


Frozen margaritas are ok, but their mix needs some changes. There
Is a funny taste to it. Texans wouldn't appreciate this"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch b/c we were craving Mexican food. We were seated immediately. I ordered a vegetarian quesadilla with rice and guacamole salad on the side. The food was pretty good, but it wasn't anything amazing. A few things that brought my review down from 4 stars to 3 stars are the lack of service and the dirty restrooms. 

We asked for ketchup and the server never came back to us. We asked the bar tender for ketchup and he finally got back to us. It was also difficult to get water refills. I wanted more salsa, but didn't want to bother with flagging down a server so I just finished my meal without it. 

I don't know if I would go back with the current service situation. I feel like they need to hire additional servers. I have to give them credit for having a giant sign outside saying 'We're hiring'.

NOTE: The refried beans are vegetarian."}
{"text":"This is the only restaraunt my family ever wants to go to satisfy our mexican cravings. My favorite are by far the fajitas that are impressively served on a steaming skillet!  Create your own combinations are always a great option too to try a couple of different things. Highly recommend the fajitas and enchiladas though."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. The service is so friendly and attentive. The pulled chicken tacos and chimichanga are my favorites. Queso is also good. Horchata is probably my favorite thing here! The ground beef taco was ok but I wouldn't get it again- the pulled chicken was just so much better."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Texas and was on a mission to find some good Mexican food and after several failed attempts, I finally found a great place! The fajitas were great, tortillas soft and warm, and the chicken chimichanga was delicious! I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Top notch margaritas frozen and regular make your own with top shelf tequila margaritas and great chips and salsa and queso.  Who cares about the food.  Although I had the guacamole salad and suiza enchiladas and they were good.  It's a little on the high end $ for the quality of entree, but again who cares.  Did I mention chilled shot glasses."}
{"text":"All I have to say is--Chi-Chi's LIVES!
If you like middle-of-the-road Tex-Mex, prepared for the tastes of white people in
Northern Rust Belt cities (and I am not embarrassed to say that, once in a while, I do)...then this place is for you.  Just check your expectations before you enter...

It really reminded me of eating at Chi-Chi's back in the day.
I had some nachos with refried beans that tasted like the beans came right out of the Ortega can.  It was topped with shredded iceberg lettuce and the dish was lined with American cheese.  Like the kind that comes wrapped in plastic.  No queso Oaxaca or nopales here, but the chips were good and I ate it all.  And it was good.

I had fish tacos for my entree, which were OK as well, though the sauce was a little bland.  (I think it was French dressing).   The margaritas tasted like they came straight from some prepared bottled mix.

It was kinda what I was in the mood for....and judging by the Southside Works area, which is filled with crappy chain experiences of every shape and size, it is what I was expecting."}
{"text":"They are only getting 1 star because I cannot leave it blank!  

Emiliano's, even though I love your Sangria Margarita (and truthfully that is the only think I love at your place), it is not worth more than the 1 star I am posting.  Why, you may ask?  Well here it goes-  so it was a busier Friday night and I had a friend in from out of town and since I live right there, we wanted something quick and within walking distance, so we figured, hey, the food is mediocre, but it is super close, so lets just do this.  There were a few open seats at the bar, so we take them as we enjoy eating at the bar and were not up for waiting.  The bartender who is not as busy as you would think since the restaurant was quite packed, made eye contact and even cleaned up right near us but seemed to not want to wait on us.  After that, and then the fact that she waited on a guy who came up after us and then another group of girls, I had to say something to someone as she was clearly not waiting on for whatever reason (we are nice people and good tippers so I do not know WTF her problem was).  Since she behaved as she did, I went to the host and asked him if there was someone who could wait on us at the bar because she was not doing so but waiting on everyone who came after us.  He got one of the serves to handle us who was FABULOUS... BUT he did not even apologize about his B*tchy bartender who was making our evening quite obnoxious when all we wanted was a quick bite to eat.  

The food is bland, the service can suck (if you get this nasty bartender that I am referring to), and it leaves me unimpressed.  I will never go back because of the service mishap and the fact that not one person apologized for her behavior and the lack of service that we had received.  If Chi Chi's still existed, I would go there before Emiliano's."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Pittsburgh! I highly recommend the veg burrito, which I request to be made extra spicy. Every time I go, it is pretty crowded and I have had to wait a long wait several of the times... but it is always worth it!"}
{"text":"My friends and I received terrible service at the south side location. We waited at least 30 minutes for the waiter to come over and ask what we wanted to drink. Then ANOTHER 15 min for him to take our order. I complained to the manager and he did not handle it the right way. He didn't compensate us for our poor service or anything. Horrible service. Don't recommend going to the south side location."}
{"text":"It is nice that they offer outdoor dining. They do make a good mixed drink. The portions are large and you won't be hungry."}
{"text":"Emiliano's is just an a-okay in my book.

The happy hour is great ($4 fishbowl margaritas on Fridays from 4-6) They also have happy hour specials all days of the week. The staff is extremely friendly, seriously! Our server was nice and the manager let us switch tables after we were seated in front of a long table of wasted men discussing/arguing about football. Its moderately priced and the theme inside is cute.

 However, I feel like for a Mexican restaurant it's lacking flavor (bland, tasteless, unmemorable). I ordered the Cabo Chicken which is advertised as this chicken dish with a pineapple sauce (it sounded delish) The chicken was barely seasoned at all and had pineapple on top. There was a sauce on the veggies, but it was dark.. I'm not sure in a pineapple glaze/sauce is dark. The rice reminded me of Uncle Bens (I'm eating clean so I can spot pre-packaged food easily now.. It might have been packaged, it might not have been.. who knows) The refried beans were yummy!! Bobby ordered the faita plate. He said it was good, but again could have had better flavor for it being a Mexican restrauant. Honestly it tasted similar to something from Applebees. I'm just saying.

BUT the service is super friendly, the free chips and salsa rock & the drink menu + happy hour is great :) We will come back for drinks and maybe an appetizer."}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectations! I love all the delicious options they have on the menu and they have a vegetarian section! Had an amazing margarita that the server helped me custom make! Really enjoyed my meal and the great service!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Lunch margaritas are my favorite. I now crave their fish tacos and taco salads ALL THE TIME. Remodeled their bar a while back, looks amazing...lots of TVs. Tableside guac is also another must-have."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican Restaurant in Pittsburgh. Our server, Melissa, was really nice. :) I also really like that the servers' name tags say what country they are from!

It's standard Mexican food but when I'm in the mood for Mexican food, it fits the bill. Their menu has good variety, the portions are filling, and I like the decor/atmosphere  of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Mexican food may be my favorite.  There are a lot of options around the area, but I always seem to gravitate toward Emiliano's....because they are awesome!

The atmosphere is very fun, without being over the top.  I can hold a conversation with my fellow diners without having to lose my voice.  And the food is amazing too!

Every meal starts with chips and salsa.  I usually judge a Mexican restaurant on their salsa, and Emiliano's definitely hits the nail on the head.  Not to mention, the chips are warm when they bring them to your table.  Warm chips and salsa?  Sign me up!

I always get a margarita, on the rocks, no salt, with a coronita in it.  They are not too sweet, which is something that I often notice about restaurant margaritas (so much SUGAR).  When it comes times to order food, most recently I got Flautas.  There was MORE than enough food to feed my belly, and I had leftovers for the next day.  Emiliano's also makes a killer guacamole... Seriously, try it!"}
{"text":"I've never drank here, so I can't comment on that, but their food menu is fairly priced and expansive.  The chimichangas are really delicious and taste fresh.  Service has always been good.  Chips and salsa always refilled."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was one of the best. Thanks to our server Melisa."}
{"text":"Reviews seem a bit mixed for Emiliano's, although having been here twice I found my experience to be pretty consistent so far. Came both times on a weekend night, and it was at least 85% or so full. There was about a 5 minute wait each time, which was very reasonable. Chips (warm!) and salsa were provided as soon as we got the table, and our orders were promptly taken. 

The fajitas were definitely the stand-outs in the menu and just looking around the restaurant, with savory sizzling plates being brought out to the tables every so often. The thing was that you could smell them from across the room, a huge motivation for ordering one. The sampler was perfect to share, with so much food that no appetizer or side was needed. The plate came loaded with different meats and shrimp, plus a lot of sweet onions and bell peppers on the base. The carnitas and shrimp were done pretty nicely both times, while the chicken might have been a bit on the dry side (but still very tasty). The steak was definitely a highlight--oftentimes, fajitas are ruined with the steak being too well-done, but this was not the case here. Instead it ended being juicy with a bit of tenderness and lots of flavor.

The standard sides of rice, refried beans, salad, and tortillas also came with the fajitas. They're probably more of a one-person serving, but that was fine with us seeing how many things were on the fajita plate. While this is not Texas, I do think that this is the go-to place for Tex Mex in the city."}
{"text":"I stopped in on the cold snap last January. i parked in front and was planning on going somewhere else, but it was so cold I didn't want to walk outside.

They serve totally standard Mexican fare. Don't expect a huge beer selection. There are free chips and salsa to start. The food I did order was pretty good and the margarita was good as well.

I will definitely keep it in mind to try again sometime!"}
{"text":"The best guacamole will be made in front of you if you order the 'Holy Mole Guacamole'. Their lunch specials come with awesome rice and you can mix and match items. The beef tacos are to die for! The service is always great, too!! Their margaritas are quite tasty!"}
{"text":"One of the best places for Mexican food in Pittsburgh. Arroz con pollo is my favorite but today I got the chicken tacos. My husband loves the steak tacos and he is pretty picky about everything."}
{"text":"Another trip to the south side made us wonder in for some MEXICAN food. 

This Place is very Nice . Very Clean & friendly. Not too loud and plenty of seating available.

I ordered the Emilianos SPECIAL combo.

 DAMN You better be hungry to finish these TWO FULL plates of really good food. A taste of just about everything on the menu. Our Waiter was very helpful and made sure that everyone's drinks never empty. Including my Dos Equis .

As usual the parking sucks in South Side , But , there is a garage across the street.  just plan to spend an extra $5.00 to park."}
{"text":"If I could do 3.5 I would! It is a good restaurant. Huge portions; you definitely won't leave hungry. A good selection of menu items for everyone, including vegetarians which was nice. It was actually a bit smaller on the inside than it seems from the outside. The booths, however, are huge. You can easily fit six people in each booth.

I ordered the Veggie Fajitas. It came as a steaming pot of vegetables with rice, beans and salad on the side. It was a make your own. It had a TON of peppers. I do agree that it all was a bit tasteless, but that is easily fixable with your preferred salsa or hot sauce and some salt. It didn't explode in my mouth, but it wasn't disappointing either. I think that some people who do not enjoy the normal natural spicy tendency of mexican food would rejoice to have the option of opting out. I would come again and try some brunch."}
{"text":"My friends and I tried Emiliano's restaurant last night and we really enjoyed the atmosphere and food. Portions were perfect, the food fresh, tasty, and hot! The only positive criticism, the  service, although polite and courteous, very slow. 
   I would still recommend people to go, just give yourself extra time for the wait. The food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Despite entering the restaurant 30 minutes prior to closing, we were warmly welcomed by the staff! The waitress was awesome and our appetizers came fast. The food was good and everything was reasonably priced. We also liked the ambiance."}
{"text":"I stopped in for an after work Margarita with some work friends.
It was huge, strong, and def yummy!  :)

i wish that I would have stayed for dinner, but after reading the reviews, I KNOW that I need to go back and check out the eats!  ;)

So far, so good... my curiosity is def piqued!  :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is good and it's priced right. The staff is extremely friendly! It's a clean, newer restaurant, which goes extremely far in my book. So happy to have them in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"2 months ago we had a poor business lunch experience. We ordered the Queso Fundido as a starter. It took over 20 minutes to come to our table after ordering and the skillet was too hot when the cheese was poured on. It instantly started burning. Awful... Servers took very long to attend to our table especially on lunch hour."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with this place. We went for lunch. My son loved the complimentary chips and salsa. I ordered the chicken and rice soup for him but ended up eating it myself (he was more interested in the chips). The soup was awesome. I love the avocado, Spanish rice and tomatoes in it. For our meal, I ordered steak fajitas. It came with refried beans, lettuce, rice, tomato, and guacamole. All together it was a tasty meal  After having the soup, I took half of my meal home. Not a bad lunch for less than $10."}
{"text":"Emilianos doesn't always have a good rep which I don't get. Living/working in the area and loving Mexican food I've been going here for years. The food and service is consistent and delicious. One star deducted because sometimes the lunch can be downright slow. I love their veggie burritos, fajitas, chicken chimichangas, chicken soup, guac...did I mention the sangria? If you're not an alcohol drink their cheese sauce is pretty drinkable too. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and was very happy with the menu. I liked the flavor of the salsa but I have had better chips. I ordered a small side of guacamole and it was good but too creamy. I am sure the table side order is much better and fresher. I then ordered the steak tacos. The portion was perfect! The meat was tender and bite size. I really liked the tomatillo salsa and the red was a little too hot for me. The refried beans were creamy and topped with cheese. I did not try the rice because I'm not a fan. The interior is colorful and inviting with lots of room for small or large parties. If I am back in town I will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. Food is always good. Ate outside and watched all those interesting Carson Street people walk by."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food. I could live off of tacos, burritos, enchiladas, etc. From awful (not even close to real Mexican) Taco Bell bean burritos, to some of the most amazing food (Mexican or otherwise) that I had in a variety of restaurants in San Diego... GIVE ME TACOS NOW.

Yesterday in the full on miserable chaos of Pittsburgh's Southside St. Patrick's Day celebration, we decided to go for Mexican rather than bar food. I could not have been happier. This was, without a doubt in my mind, the highlight of a rainy obnoxious holiday that the majority uses as an excuse to be poorly mannered. 

Walking into the establishment in an area of the Southside that I rarely venture to (Not a big fan of gentrification of most city's neighborhoods.) was a pleasant surprise. The hosting staff was friendly and attentive even on a very busy day like Saturday was. We were immediately seated and our drink orders were taken. Truth be told, I'm a beer girl at heart. I can no pass up a decent margarita on the rocks. While $9 was a little steep for me as far as drinks go (mainly because I rarely want to have just ONE margarita), the pomegranate margarita on the rocks was delicious. Served the first time with a slice of lime and the second time with a slice of orange, I preferred the pomegranate with orange slice combo best.

The menu is a little pricey but this isn't Taco Bell. They have a lot of authentic Mexican choices and I honestly had a difficult time choosing. The complimentary chips and salsa were delicious, fresh, and quickly refilled. In the end I kept it simple and went with the grilled carne asada tacos. The meat was delicious and the salsa and beans/rice/etc was really well cooked.

In all the service was great, the food was delicious if a bit pricey, and the drinks were spectacular. While not an \"all the time\" place for me, it's a great once in a while dinner."}
{"text":"Randomly driving through bloomfield, my wife and I saw our friend chuck at a bus stop and picked him up. Chuck was heading towards the Beehive in south side so we gave him a lift and on the way stopped for a quick bite at Emiliano's. Needless to say, I was pretty surprised with everything.

 Decently priced, and Delicious. I ordered the Enchiladas Poblanas, and the mole sauce was amazing. At only $9.99, it was definately on par with what I would expect to pay. My wife's fish tacos were also really good, and with the sides it came with was way too much food, always a good thing.

 The only complaint was our waitress, she was not very involved with our table aside from the occasional refill. She kind of disappeared til it was time to pay. Other then that everything was great!"}
{"text":"This place is A-Ok in my book.  Very clean interior and friendly restaurant staff meet you upon entering Emilianos.  Pretty extensive options on the menu food wise.  As soon as you sit down, you're given some pretty amazing chips and salsa, which are FREE!

Next,  I ordered the tacos de carne asada.  Pretty good steak, but I've had better in the Pittsburgh area.  The salsa that came with the carne asada tacos was very good, but I spiced it up even more with some habanero hot sauce.  

Overall, I would come back, because I like the ambiance here and the servers are extra friendly.  Not a bad place to grab a drink either."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I love this place or if I just love cheesy Mexican and drinks with tequila... but I'm going with I love this place.

Best thing hands down on the menu are the chorizo tacos.  They are in the back of the menu marked \"grilled tacos\" and you will most likely miss it.  Don't.  And get these.  They are spicy and simple (two corn taco shells - authentic and soft - for each of the three tacos you get filled simply with their spicy and yummy chorizo).  They give you two sauces and a fresh lime to jazz them up.

Friends got the fajitas and seemed to really like them and I would also recommend the Queso Fundito and Chicken Nachos for group munching.

If you leave here hungry and completely sober, you have not done your job properly.

PS - Nothing screams authenticity like misspellings on an \"ethnic\" menu.  CHARMING.

PPS - When I found out this was a chain - local, but still a chain - I cried a little inside.  I stick to the Southside location and try to forget there's one on McNightmare.  Makes me feel better."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Salsa was average. We shared some tacos (Carne Asada and Carnitas) and both were over cooked and dried out. Margaritas were average as well. Will not return."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of Mexican food.  I was disappointed when I moved to Pittsburgh 5 years ago at the lack of options in the city.  Luckily that has improved over the years.  Emilianos is a place I knew existed, but for some reason I never actually made the trip to the South Side to try it out until last night.

Many of the other reviews on this site are spot on.  The one critique I saw in other reviews that I didn't experience was poor service.  We were visiting on a cold Wednesday night, so perhaps the fact that it was a slower time affected this.  Regardless, our service was excellent, if not overbearing at times.  I think our server visited our table at least 5 times during the course of our meal.  Perhaps they have read their reviews and focused on this.

The meal started promising enough.  I was happy to see free unlimited chips and salsa.  That is becoming rare these days.  In addition, the margaritas were quite good as well.  My girlfriend had the Sangria Margarita, and it bordered on too sour at times, but it was acceptable.  The food was just 'ok'.  That's the best way to put it.  I had the steak fajitas and my girlfriend had the steak fajita quesadilla.  My fajitas were fine.  Nothing spectacular, but perfectly acceptable for a fajita.  The quesadilla was another story.  First of all, it wasn't even cut, which was bizarre.  It arrived at the table as a complete folded over tortilla.  Second, one of the main components of a quesadilla is cheese, and the cheese that was in her dish was odd to say the least.  I would put it somewhere between a queso sauce and the pump cheese you get on your nachos at a ballpark.  I would have expected a melted shredded cheese of some sort.

I didn't hate my meal, but for the price (45 dollars for 2 entrees and 2 margaritas), I would probably take my service elsewhere the next time I get a craving for Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"I am so glad to have finally found good Mexican food in Pittsburgh!  This place is wonderful.  They have a large selection of authentic Mexican dishes, and many vegetarian options.  

Chips and salsa come gratis, and the pint margarita ($2.99 on Mondays) I ordered was fantastic.  This place has drink specials every day, all day--even on weekends.  

I would give them 5 stars, but the service was sloooow.  It doesn't matter, though, we'll definitely be back for the food."}
{"text":"that was awesome dinner that we had tonight!! food was delicious! actually it was amazing !!!! service was fast even they were busy ! we loved it and will back !!"}
{"text":"I have been to Emilianos 3-5 times over the past several years. The service, food, and margaritas have always been OK or good, never terrible or great. I dined here most recently on Friday night with friends and ordered a margarita and chicken quesadilla. The margarita was all right, but I believe that Mad Mex serves up a much tastier margarita. The chicken quesadilla was pretty tasty, though I personally prefer slices of chicken to the shredded chicken in these quesadillas. Our waiter was nice enough but could have offered better service. Our chips and salsa were quickly eaten but never replaced, and I was never offered a second margarita. Overall, I don't dislike this restaurant but would select to dine at a Mad Mex instead any day."}
{"text":"This place is a mess. I was told that the cooks don't understand english so any substitutions might not be correct- they weren't. When I complained the manager just kind of shrugged but was nice and took the upcharge off my meal. However, after I paid she then short-changed me 20$, which unfortunately I feel was done on purpose. Theres plenty other mexican places in South Side and this place just isn't worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Queso fundido (appetizer made at table-side on a super hot cast iron plate) and Pollo Mexicano was too much food for a 1-person lunch but EXCELLENTE!  They may have surpassed El Campesino as my favorite local Mexican place.  Very good service also.  I need to go to the gym multiple times after that lunch but I left with a smile on my face.  I have tried 3 different things on last 3 visits and all were excellent.  Who said you could not find good Mexican food in Pittsburgh?"}
{"text":"I have been eating at both the north hills location along with the one in south side since either have opened and I have to say that the food has gone down hill. My boyfriend and I really wanted good Mexican food but we both have different ideas of what that means. I like food that reminds me of what my great grandmother would make and he likes Tex-Mex (anywhere that puts cheese on their tacos) Emiliano's seemed like a good compromise. He ordered the shrimp taco salad and I got shrimp Vallarta. We also shared some guacamole. The guacamole was good and made table side. My boyfriend's salad looked pretty tasty to me but he was not impressed. The shrimp Vallarta was extremely disappointing. It tasted like a plate of shrimp covered in ketchup. I know that the sauce should have a similar taste profile because of the ancho and vinegar. But, this was almost as is if they cooked shrimp and poured a bottle of sacred Heinz all over. It was not good."}
{"text":"Bollo is the BEST bartender/server. We come specifically to see him. Love Emiliano's food. Closest to authentic I grew up with. 
Ditto one year later. Always attentive when so busy. We return because of the service"}
{"text":"Totally a great Mexican place ! Order the Aroz Con Pollo (acp) . The queso dip is a deal breaker ."}
{"text":"My fellow Yelpers reviews averaged 3  1/2 stars so I expected a decent experience.  I'll give it three stars but it really should be 2  1/2.

I showed up at Happy Hour during the week and the place was dead.  I sat at the bar and ordered the house marg with no salt and it was served as requested and tasted fine.  Later on I ordered a second one and it was served with salt.  As the place was still dead I was mildly annoyed.

The chips were warm and fresh and the salsa was bland.

Ordered Chori-Pollo and quick as a flash my entrée arrived but it was the wrong dish.  Lots of apologies and smiles and a second quick flash later the correct dish arrived.  It was mostly hot and tasty but the re-fried beans served as a side were cold.

When I asked for my check the friendly bartender promptly gave me another patron's check.  Once again, lots of apologies and smiles and the correct check was presented.

Overall there were too many bumps in the road and the meal was just average.  There are about a thousand places to eat and drink on Carson Street.  These folks gave me no reason to return."}
{"text":"I have been here so many times and NEVER have had a bad experience, one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh! Drinks, food, and staff are always on point, and wait for food is never that long even when it's busy. Recently we went and our server Tommie was awesome, she took great care of us. Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"As a South Side resident, Emiliano's has become my first-choice Mexican restaurant...BUT only if I'm craving Mexican food and I'm too lazy to drive to Rey Azteca in Monroeville.

As expected, the chips and salsa are good, and the cheese dip is on-par with most \"authentic\" Mexican eateries popping up these days, so it's easy to get settled into your meal. 

The entrées aren't going to blow you away, but if you're on a Mexican food kick, the food will definitely satiate your craving. I've tried a few of their burritos, the enchiladas rancheras, and the fajitas - all of which are pretty good. Again, not the best I've ever had, but still very good.

Service has always been hit-or-miss for us. We've ordered drinks and never had them arrive, and we've also waited for what seemed like an eternity for our check other times. Of course, we've also had really good service a few times, so if you're in a hurry, I would recommend telling your server when you sit down and hope for the best. As with most Mexican restaurants, your food will come out quickly, but you might find yourself waiting for refills and your check.

Regardless, I really enjoy Emiliano's. The food is good, the atmosphere is relaxed, and employees are very friendly. Plus, I've never had to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Decent place for some quick Mexican food on a weekday. I had the avocado salad here. Portions are huge as expected. Friendly service."}
{"text":"My wife and I went with some friends from work to the Cranberry Twp location on a Saturday night. There was a short wait, but, nothing that I would consider unusual.
We had great service, the waitress was very attentive, and the food was great. The food was seasoned well, but not over seasoned. Everything that was ordered came out hot, and quick.

Price was very reasonable for what we ordered. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if possible. Came in on a Sunday when it wasn't busy at all.  Got seated immediately but that was the extent of the service we received. We were never approached by a waiter and after 30 minutes of being ignored, we got up and left. I made sure to let the hostess know as we were leaving. I reached out immediately to the restaurant on facebook in regards to my experience and they messaged me back. They told me since it was the  weekend, it most likely wouldn't be dealt with until Monday and that they would reach out to me then.  A week later and I've heard nothing back.  Terrible customer service.  There are way better businesses on the south side with much better service than this place."}
{"text":"Dinner for four before a concert.  Bar staff was really nice.  Place is cute and roomy inside.  Waiter was nice as well.  Beware - free chips and really good salsa.  You will fill up and not be able to eat your meal.  Honestly.  Table side guacamole.  It was wonderful.  Also ordered the Cancun Enchiladas  - not a lot of shrimp but a ton of veggies.  If you really want a lot of shrimp this will not satisfy you.  It's huge but I think I only had about 5 little shrimp inside.  Got the steak fajitas.  Husband loved them.  All in all, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Emiliano's has never ever disappointed me! I have been here several times and never had a bad experience. The food has always been awesome here. My favorite drink is the coronarita and my wife's favorite drink is the margarita which is the one of the best one you can find in Pittsburgh. If you are in the South Side area and craving Mexican food, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Table.  Side.  Guacamole.  Need I say more?

This is a tasty place to visit when you're in South Side Works.  Though their food is a little bland, maybe pre-made in some cases, it's a nice treat if you're looking to satisfy your hankering for fresh made tortilla chips or a tangy margarita.

I've been here a few times thus far.  Recently I ordered a taco salad, since the weather was H-O-T and I couldn't consume anything heavy.  It wasn't the typical taco salad with the sour cream, salsa, and plop of meat.  My grilled chicken was flavorful and it was topped with delicious veggies that my stomach greatly appreciated.  I was unsure about the salad dressing, cilantro lime, but the waiter urged me to try it.  Kudos to him for that recommendation!  Sweet, tart, and LIGHT!  All of that with a crisp and tasty shell, I left one happy girl. 

OH!  I forgot to mention my Sangria Margarita - or as I call it - the Sangarita.  What a perfect combination.  Sweet, tart, tangy, with a kick of tequila - a cool summer cocktail which I will enjoy all summer long.

I rate this a 3.5 - if the food was a bit more flavorful, it would be a solid 4."}
{"text":"I've been here in the past and not had a bad experience but my most recent visit on 7/12 was not good.

So we go on an uncrowded Saturday around 4pm.  We are seated promptly and they take our order.  The whole point of going was to get a big nacho platter they have.  Well we order that and two entrees and guess what. No nachos ever appear.  

We remind our waitress of  this when our food arrives ahead of our appetizer and I gotta say she was  dismissive about it,  \"Oh I forgot.\"  Forgetting what we ordered really isn't okay and you need to try and make amends not just ask if we still want it.

The food we did get was only alright. I got one of the Pittsburgh themed burritos and wife got a California burrito.  Both were just okay.

The place is clean but the bathroom door handle for example  was broken and a staffer was in there talking on their cell phone. 

All in all I sad to see this place start to slide."}
{"text":"On saturday April 28, 2017 as group of 12, we called ahead previous day to let them know we  would be arriving at 12:30.  

As I walked in door they had a seating set up for us.  To which I say a big Thank you!

Services was fantasic.  I know dealing with a large table is not easy especially when 3 are kids.   The staff was so accommodating, professional and all around great.

Our food came out in timely manner, and there was not a single complaint.  Everyone enjoyed their food.  

Everyone at table said they will return.

Thank you to the staff for a great lunch and experience."}
{"text":"Good meal at Emiliano's!  The service was excellent, she was on top of everything.

We got the table side queso to start, definitely a splurge and loaded with calories but delicious!  Their chips and salsa are solid as well.

I always do the combo, 2 burritos, 1  with pulled chicken, 1 with steak tips.  Both of these meats are great, tender and juicy.  Burrito sauce is good as well.  My SO got the pork wings, which were AWESOME!! Perfect hint of chocolate in the sauce!

Portions are large, we had a ton to takeaway.  Emiliano's is consistently good for Tex-mex/American Mexican food."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times now and while I want to like it because I like the location and I love Mexican food, I unfortunately think it's just okay. I do think it is fairly standard for as far as Mexican restaurants in America go, but even for that I have had better. I recall having the fajita quesadilla which I swear had nacho cheese in it. The veggies fajitas are okay and I've gotten that a few times. The staff is always very friendly which is a plus. They do have a full bar and I recommend a margarita or mojito. I wouldn't be opposed to coming back if someone wanted to, but I might choose somewhere else on my own."}
{"text":"A nice way to start a quick (18 hour) visit to Pittsburgh, with what was probably the best queso fundido (with chorizo) we've ever had, prepared tableside. I had the California burrito, which was grilled before serving, a nice touch!  Friendly staff, good drinks, check it out if you're on the South Side!"}
{"text":"I was seriously disappointed with my experience here. Everything from the food to the service was poor. Our waitress acted like we were bothering her and never even made an effort to check in on us throughout our meal. This might be somewhat acceptable if you're absolutely slammed and running around like crazy trying to serve everyone, but that wasn't the case. They weren't even busy at all!

On top of really poor service, the food was very underwhelming. Margaritas tasted like overpriced fruit juice. The queso dip was unusually small. The other order of chili con queso was just beef, no queso. My friend ordered double rice and her portion looked like mine which was only a single order. 

It could have been an off night and our server could have been having a rough day, but that's no reason to make customers feel like a bother. I wouldn't go back and I wouldn't recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"I really like Emilianos.  The chile relleno is great as is the tortilla soup and I LOVE the sangria!!!"}
{"text":"My criteria for a good Mexican restaurant is strong margs, delicious queso and tasty tacos and Emiliano's has all 3!  If you are getting margaritas there, I would order the pitcher!  I think we were able to get about 5-6 glasses out of the pitcher which was more than enough!  The steak tacos were perfectly seasoned and the combination of flavors was perfect! If you're looking for a good Mexican place in the Southside then definitely give Emilliano's a try!"}
{"text":"It's pretty good. I enjoy eating here. I just only had an issue with the chicken being too salty. It was not very flavorful, just extremely salty. I love the salsa and chips...I could eat that all day! And the margaritas are delicious as well!!!!"}
{"text":"I would eat here everyday if it were possible.  Is this a short review, yes.  But it's honest."}
{"text":"Terrible service, all 3 orders came out wrong and waitress proceeded to argue with us that we ordered it wrong instead of getting new orders. Will never come back. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Probably favorite Mexican food in Pittsburgh that isn't tacos or tapas strictly. Welcoming atmosphere, good food, and attentive staff make the experience worth it. We've never been disappointed coming here, never having anything less than a stellar meal. If this place can't make you something you enjoy the problem is with you not emilianos. Juan is absolutely awesome."}
{"text":"4 of us decided to stop here for lunch on Saturday.   We ordered cocktails and it took about 20 minutes to get them.  They were awful.  We ordered guac and never got it.  Finally, an hour later we got our food.  Mine looked nothing like the picture.  It was an egg on top of tortilla chips.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Our server, Kaitlyn, was more of a friend than a server. She made everything super casual and answered questions perfectly. Looking for a beer recommendation, she suggested the Modelo Negra and it was a huge hit with us. Thanks Kaitlyn!!!!"}
{"text":"The menu seemed to imply that the tacos were very good, so I decided to order a plate of fish tacos for myself and some fresh guacamole to share with my friends. The guacamole was good, but a small portion (especially for the price). The tacos were good too, but a bit smelly. My biggest critique was that they were over-priced; if I'm paying $12 for three tacos, then they better be some incredible tacos.

On a positive note, Emiliano's had a nice atmosphere. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves with their giant margaritas. Overall, it's a nice restaurant but simply over-priced."}
{"text":"Decided to try because of the great reviews. I ordered takeout and decided on the Arroz con Camarones (grilled shrimp with mixed veggies over rice). My meal was hot, excellent and came with nachos and salsa. The price is hard to beat ~$14.99 and the portion size is perfect. The shrimp were large (notch below jumbo compared to grocery store sizes) and well cooked without being overdone. Perfect plumpness. The one thing that could have been better is the spice level. There was none. A dash of hot sauce or more pepper would have been appreciated. I definitely will return and make this particular meal a go-to."}
{"text":"As far as the food goes, it's mediocre, fairly bland, odd textures at times, overcooked, and what is this red stuff? Where is the queso? 

But the big issue, SERVICE..

We walked in early one friday afternoon, only one other table besides ours was occupied. There were 3 waitresses on staff that day yet we waited to be seated. We ordered one beer each and finished it before our meal came. Someone from the kitchen brought it, and our waitress was over at the bar wiping the same spot for 15 minutes and zoning out. Never came to check on us or get us refills until I flagged her down about 10 minutes after we finished to ask for our bill. THEN she asks if we would like a refill. But let's not forget the stink eye she gave when she saw her tip. Sorry sweetie, maybe you should have tried earning it. You're lucky you got anything at all."}
{"text":"Carne asada is good here!"}
{"text":"So I see a lot of people saying that this place had bland food, but I ordered the Camarones a la Mexicana (Grilled shrimp covered in a delicious, medium-hot chipotle pepper sauce. 14.99). The shrimp was EXCELLENT. It had tons of flavor.The rice was okay, it wasn't nasty and it wasn't the best. The guacamole was most likely fresh and pretty tasty. Their salsa was good and the chips were GREAT. I also ordered a side a beans ( which I think should MOST DEFINITELY come with the meal) and they were actually pretty decent, I liked them. I also asked if the restaurant had horchata (if you don't know what that is please get hip) and that horchata was comforting! In Los Angeles it's easy to walk into a Mexican restaurant in get horchata, but in Pittsburgh... Nahhhh. So I was super excited when the man made me some horchata (with no ice... God bless his soul). But this restaurant is definitely good, and it is a huge upgrade from Gran Agave at the Waterfront."}
{"text":"If you know me, you know I love Pittsburgh's Emiliano's Mexican restaurant. This obsession dates back half a decade when I discovered the Southside location via my college friends. If someone had a birthday we probably we're getting out of the dirty South Oakland (Pitt's off-campus housing area) and venturing to the Southside for divine margaritas and delicious food.

Post-college I moved about 2 blocks away from the Southside location. I used to joke that the SouthSide Works was the \"most dangerous part of town\" for me to live; since I was within 2 blocks of Emiliano's, as in close enough to be dangerous to my waistline and bank account.

My whole love affair with a Mexican restaurant is actually unexpected because I don't love tequila, nor do I eat beans, peppers, or anything at all remotely spicy. What I do love are chips. cheese, chorizo, and avocado, which Emiliano's dishes are filled with.

I have two favorite dishes at Emiliano's, the grilled shrimp quesadilla and the Choripollo. Emilian's grilled shrimp quesadilla is unlike any I've had elsewhere. The shrimp are sweet, tasty & meaty for a $12.99 appetizer, but the best part to me is the cheese. I'm unsure what type of cheese Emiliano's uses (it's yellow) but it is delicious and sweet as well. This dish is perfect for me since it's not an overwhelming amount of food. I can indulge in my margaritas chips & salsa too without feeling too guilty.

My other favorite dish is the Choripollo, a marinated chicken breast topped with chorizo sausage and a delicious white cheese sauce. For 14.99 this dish is amazing. It's a huge chicken breasts doused in the cheese & sausage mixture, served with rice, tortillas, guacamole salad and more taco cheese. I always have plenty of leftovers with this order.

Their margaritas on the rocks with a salt rim are my all time favorite drink, besides Moscato. I crave them, ask my BF. These margaritas are smooth and refreshing not sickly sweet like many bar versions can be. It is a good deal to get the pitcher of margarita on the rocks, if you are with at least one other person and you each plan on having more than 1 margarita. Think of it as an investment. 

My boyfriend explores the menu more than I do. His recent favorite dish is the Chipotle Pork Wings, three  slow-smoked pork ribs basted in a sweet and spicy chipotle-bbq sauce, served over a bed of rice and black beans. For 14.99 this is another amazing quality meal full of flavor.

I truly love this place, it might be my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant. Anytime we are going to splurge and go out I always petition for Emiliano's. Since we now live in the North Hills of Pittsburgh we will even visit the Cranberry Emiliano's location.  Which makes me even more excited that Emiliano's has announced they're opening a location in McCandless Crossing! Now Emiliano's will be all but 10 minuets away from me. I better start saving my meals out budget to prepare! I've already told everyone I know how excited I am haha 

I wrote more about my Emiliano's Mexican, A Love Affair  & posted pictures of my fave margaritas on my blog at http://moscatoismymantra.com/emlianos-love-affair/"}
{"text":"Easily my wife and my favorite Mexican in the city. The table side Holy Guacamole is fantastic. The Enchiladas Suizas, Fajitas Texanas, and the Burrito Cancun are a few of our favorites! Service is always fantastic. Stop at the bar for an awesome drink from Bollo. He won't disappoint! 10 out of 10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. We started w/fresh chips @ great salsa, along w/steak quesadilla. My companions enjoyed Chimichanga and Fajitas. I had the Jalesimo Special which included a very tender & mouth watering slice of chicken and steak w/onions & mushrooms topped by a light cheese sauce. Oh yes, did I mention the Mango Jalapeño margarita -----great! Priced reasonably given the quality."}
{"text":"Great value
Good food
Good service
Salsa good
Pork wings great--ask for sauce on side"}
{"text":"If you love Mexican you should give this place a try!!  Came for lunch got the combo platter with 3 items plus 2 sides!!  Chips and salsa are fantastic!!  Our server Kaitlyn was awesome we never wanted or asked for anything she was great!!"}
{"text":"Cinco de Mayo was chaotic but kuddos to the staff for handling it like a boss! I showed up for the pitchers of margaritas and ended up nibbling on my friend's refried beans and I tried mole for the first time. I wasn't a fan of mole and that's okay it wasn't mine to like but when I ordered churros I half expected to just get plain churros with cinnamon and sugar and was happily surprised with something else! I try churros every time I'm not hungry but want something to nibble on at a Mexican restaurant and these are by far the best I've ever had. I usually don't like churros that are filled but this is the exception.  I felt like I was in a churro inception because the more I bit into the churro dessert the more churro I discovered swimming in a pool of the creamiest of ice cream. It all made me feel like a big kid and all the noise surrounding me was gone. I didn't even notice the other people at the bar eyeing this decadent dessert but I did share it with my best friend who discovered that I really like churros since I order them everywhere I go. This dessert and the two and half hour wait sealed the deal for me. I will be back to try the rest of their menu and to conquer the churro delight."}
{"text":"Mom's birthday was belatedly observed this evening, and since she's a lifelong Mexicophile (even though she's not at all Mexican), it was takeout for her from her choice, Emiliano's. 

Mom, Dad, and Sis all ordered Emiliano's Special, a platter with one of each of the following: burrito, tostada, enchilada, chile relleno, taco, plus one serving of rice and beans. 

Dad and Sis didn't comment, but Mom claims her food was blandsville aside from the chile relleno, which I also found to be a pretty potent, parched, ground beef-packed, poblano upon partaking of it. 

The tamale I got to taste was fairly harmless, starchy, and had some dry chicken inside. 

Being born in February will always make one the square peg in the family, particularly when your father, mother, and sister have natal days in July, August, and September respectively. 

I, The Aquarian ordered the Burrito Cancun, a jumble of scallops (you can also choose shrimp), beans, sauteed onions, tomatoes, and bell peppers bound up in a flour tortilla. The only thing I didn't like about it was that it didn't have a twin; I wanted more! The scallops were meaty, plentiful, spicy, and luscious. The tortilla was a blanket used to swaddle infant angels. The veggies complimented everything, and I didn't mind the beans, even though I'm not a fan of them. The burrito came with sour cream and an adequate example of guacamole. 

The Queso Con Carne was also a winner, its milky consistency and delicate flavor serving as a fine coating for what were the apex of fried corn tortilla chips. They were so ideally esculent, not to mention a radiant shade of yellow, I ate half of them plain, until I came across that fruity, minty, dandy picosa salsa of theirs. We've still got a bagful of chips and two styrofoam cups of that salsa left, and my midnight snack is past due...

Spicy food is something I do  like, but for me, it's certainly not a necessity, even for Mexican food, so perhaps that colors my rating a bit. My favorite Mexican foods are rich and filling; my burrito was just that and more. 

I liked most of what I had from the obviously polemical Emiliano's. Un cuatro es lo que obtiene.

*shrugs shoulders*"}
{"text":"Love it here! The queso is our favorite! The chips are always fresh and warm, the service is always awesome! Before our bowl of chips is gone, another one is brought. Our drinks are never empty. The staff is always friendly and pleasant and working really hard. The food has been consistently delicious! As a vegetarian, I appreciate having several options to choose from. My favorite are the potato taquitos."}
{"text":"The service is hit or miss, but the food is almost always great. The staff was all eating lunch at the same time one day when we came in. They had to fight over who was going to get up to seat and serve us."}
{"text":"Fantastic all around. We sat on the outdoor patio and enjoyed every minute.

Great food selection. Great service. Great food presentation and taste. Great service. And fair pricing to boot.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My first experience was great I had a margarita and steak tacos.. the best tacos I had in my life :) and its my first dinner in Pittsburgh, many more to come :)"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  I always pass by it on my way to and from work....heard a lot of good things about it.  I saw a lot of great looking things on the menu.  As soon as we sat down, on came the disappointments.  The waiter/bartender was lazy as heck.  The only time that he came to check on us was when we complained to the manager about the horrible food and service we were experiencing.  I ordered Tamales, Burrito and Chicken taco....It took forever for the food to arrive (over 30 minutes, which the manager/staff got an earfull about) and then when the food arrived, they forgot to bring the taco!  And then when they finally brought the taco, it was ice cold.  The entire experience was a complete let down.  When we went to complain and ask for the manager, it was as if the manager didn't even want to cop to being the manager...as if he was afraid of us.  Sheesh...Lots of great reviews I'm seeing on Yelp from this place so maybe the staff thought that my wife and I just deserved \"Special Treatment?\"  If you go to this place, just beware that maybe you'll be the next one to be singled out.  LOL...  Guess I'll jsut stick to Patron's"}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 star experience, but I am rounding up.

Many choices and very generous portions. Prices are fair and the tableside guac is great.  The food is generally very good.

Can be very busy during lunch and Friday and Saturday nights."}
{"text":"I have really became a big fan of this place over the past couple months. I get the same entree (veggie quesadilla) every time and it is consistently really really yummy! Whether you get your food to go or dine in, it always is really good. Their drinks are pretty decent and they really have a nice selection overall. The chips and salsa the servers greet you with are perfect to munch on while you sit and relax, ask for some cheese dip :) Usually the service is on point and we always enjoy our selves! 

After my recent visit this past weekend, it seemed like they got super busy and the server got weeded pretty quickly. The manager did a really nice job of zooming around and helping her out.  When he realized we had been sitting there for over 20 minutes just waiting for her to come back, he was so sincere and apologized. I appreciate he took the time to realize what was wrong and and even took care of our dessert! CHURROS = amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with a lot of the reviews - most of what Emilianos has to offer is unremarkable - however: 

- The service is very fast and very friendly;
- The chips and salsa are free - and table-side guac is at least fresh and cheaper than whatever godawful price avocados are selling for these days; and,
- If you remember that this is Tex-Mex, not authentic Mexican food (go to Reyna's in the Strip), then you will find a decent, inexpensive lunch or dinner.

I'm happy with my experiences at Emiliano's and typically make it my go-to option for lunch when I'm at the SouthSide Works."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night with friends. We were given tortilla chips and salsa to start off with. I had the street style chorri pollo tacos. The tacos were delicious! I loved the corn tortillas with cilantro, onion, and sauces given. There were three tacos, so I was stuffed by the end. The tacos also came with a side of rice and beans. My friend who had the quesadilla said it was delicious and huge. Their mojitos were also excellent, light and refreshing. Overall, a great place to grab Mexican in the southside."}
{"text":"My Dad and I frequent the Emiliano's located in the North Hills once a week - I would go every day if I could but that would be horrible for the diet/figure. That being said, this is 1 of the BEST Mexican restaurants that has graced itself upon the Pittsburgh area!!! It is authentic as it gets, delicious every time, great service (we get the same wonderful waitress every week, Natasha), beautiful decor, great drinks & just a relaxed ambiance. I've been to them all, a lot of 5 star restaurants in and around the area and nothing compares to Emiliano's! I would chose this place over Morton's, Ruth Chris or Monterey Bay almost any day! This is in my honest opinion a true Pittsburgh Gem and is 1 of the only true Mexican Restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. Mad Mex is a bunch of tex mex garbage, El Campesino's is unsanitary (look for annual write ups in the Post Gazette on El Campy's). The only other Mexican Restaurants that can hold a match to Emiliano's would be Patrons in Wexford or the Franklin Inn on Rochester Road (North Hills) (although is not authentic Mexican by any means but still very good!). So, please disregard the nay sayers or the Debbie downers and check this place out - I have never been disappointed in all my years and I believe you won't be either : ) Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came in on Sunday at 12 noon with a party of 8.   Ordered off the menu, nothing too special.   Food took an hour to come out, while many other newer customers got fajitas and other food items.   

When the food came out, cooked wrong, missing sides and difficult staff to deal with.   When many items were pointed out, staff did not respond with much care.    The manager in the blue shirt is clueless and seems to just stand at the front door and greet customers.   

To the Manager, your restaurant is failing because of you.  You are clueless to what is going on.   Would give zero stars if possible."}
{"text":"Service was nice, prices okay... I just wasn't that impressed with the food.
I found it to be somewhat bland, nothing I would ever crave again, but portions were large and made for pretty good leftovers. I would come again but not necessarily want to."}
{"text":"This is a good Mexican place. It's pretty typical Mexican food but it gets pretty busy on the weekends and they have strong Margaritas. They have a little outdoor patio and it is always busy in the summer."}
{"text":"EVERYTHING HERE IS GOOD! The fishbowl size margaritas are bound to get any night started on a good note. Their fajitas are my favorite. I think I have had em all. If you are nearby you MUST stop in and have a bite or a drink. The staff is always welcoming!"}
{"text":"It's a lazy Saturday afternoon. We have tickets to an show at City Theatre at 2pm, so we stopped at Emiliano's for lunch. My mom and I both got enchilada entrees. I got Suiza (mild green sauce) and Mom got the supreme (red mole sauce).  I've had other dishes here, but Mom usually sticks with what she knows she likes. I've never been disappointed with the quality our service here; today was no different. We sat in the bar area and our server was the always amazing Bollo. If you make it out to Emiliano's in the south side, ask for Bollo by name!"}
{"text":"This is my son's favorite Mexican restaurant so I decided to give it a try. I got there shortly after it opened and was able to order from the lunch menu. The decor is superb!  The staff was very attentive to my needs.

As is always the case you can get lunch entrees for way less than you would for dinner. This is the first time I saw an entree which I haven't seen in years. \"Arroz con pollo\" AKA chicken with rice. I have not seen this entree in some of the other Mexican restaurants I visited so I ordered that.

I was given complementary chips and salsa and had my food fairly quickly. The chips were very crunchy and I didn't want to eat to many of them so I could eat my lunch. When I got my meal I was amazed at the size!  For a lunch portion it was very generous! The chicken with mushrooms,onions, sour cream and everything else lay on top of a plate of rice. It was very filling to say the least. Since these are chicken strips cut  into the entree there were a couple of occasions where I found it just a little tough to chew but didn't feel the need to send it back. For the most part it was very good.

I was glancing at the folks at the next table who had ordered a dessert. They had ordered fried ice cream in a taco shell and I was literally blown away but the size of it. They told me it was indeed very good. It should be noted that they do offer vegetarian selections.

Since this week is Cinco de Mayo, Emiliano's is offering daily specials. Some of those specials are contingent on what location you are dining at. Today's is \"drop your business card\" and if you win they give you a meal for 25 people. Not my idea of a special but I came to try it out.

Note they have a birthday club you can sign up for so you get a free meal on your birthday. I did this and got a bounce back coupon for $5.00 off my meal which is good till June 1st.

Emiliano's has 3 locations with the other two being in Cranberry and Gibsonsia. Tres Rios down the street is an offshoot of this restaurant. They have a full bar and is more family oriented. Off street parking is available and I am grateful to be able to try a Mexican dish I hadn't seen for years.

If you are a fan of this restaurant I just learned they are building a 4th location in McCandless Crossing."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to try this place out because of the word of mouth. Well, wishing we didn't waste our time.

The owner or manager was very nice and sat us as soon as we walked in. After a few short minutes our waitress came over and took our drink orders. Was pretty shocked she didn't card us at all! That is a huge violation and I know from being in the food industry before that you need to card everyone!

After we got our drinks we sat there for nearly 25 minutes and order was never taken. I went to tell the manager/order because we just wanted to pay for our drinks and leave. We were told it was okay, didn't have to pay. 

If it was possible to give a zero I would. Service like this is really uncalled for. I will never give this place another shot again. We wasted our time for nothing. Everyone should know how bad this service is."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I haven't explored much of the Mexican cuisine in Pittsburgh, so I don't have much to compare to but I would definitely go back! The wait was kind of long and the place was crowded, but it was a Friday night so that's to be expected. I got one of their combinations and I was pleasantly surprised by the portion size. The chips and salsa were a good starter, the margarita was good, and even with all of the busy-ness we still had great service!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend came here before our movie starts on a Friday night. It was busy but not busy enough to ignore me for ten minutes :/ I did not have a good first impression, and after they finally greeted me, they told me the credit card machine is down. I was very disappointed but me and my boyfriend was so hungry at this point we are willing to just share a plate and pay cash. We sat at the bar because the wait was fifteen minutes for a table. The bartender was very friendly and professional. Ooh their chips and salsa are so good! We had two bowls of them, they're very addictive! Afterwards we shared a entree which is a good size, we are surprisingly full. Since we saved some money by sharing entree, we ordered their dessert. We pick churros! Omg guys their churros are the best I've had in a restaurant. Just look at the picture man! Wow after the dinner I was so happy that I forgot about all my complaints when I first walked in. I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre, service is mediocre, atmosphere is mediocre, everything is just mediocre. Not bad, not good, nothing memorable but a nice go-to."}
{"text":"Mexican food has gotta give you a kick in the butt...and I mean that in the nicest way possible.  You have to have that special pizazz in your pico, zest in your mex, taste in your taco....you get the point!  

Coming here there's no kick, no punch, not even a wimpy slap in the face.  I agree with Beth M, it's just bland.  I ordered a chicken burrito and the chicken was that stringy kind you get in a can.  They had to have stuffed the whole can in because all I could really taste was bland chicken with a little bit of lettuce, tomato, etc.  The rice and re-fried beans were exactly the same.  No real taste.  I was pretty disappointed in everything BUT....

FREE CHIPS AND SALSA!  

I get pretty bitter when chips and salsa aren't offered for free, so this was the only plus.  I scarfed down enough to make myself not as bitter about the food.  So maybe stop in for the chips and salsa....you'll potentially look cheap...but hey, the food should be better!"}
{"text":"Magnificent Mexican restaurant in the South Side of Pittsburgh. Fantastic fajitas, terrific tacos and burritos. All delicious! The staff is friendly and attentive. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Emiliano's never ceases to amaze me with their portions in... everything! I got a pitcher of lime margarita on the rocks to split with my friend and it was enough to gracefully put, get you plastered gloriously. The food has always been quite yummy, although I do wish they do a little better job with their presentation. Overall, very happy with this place and would come back always! 

One small recommendation: I think it would be awesome to have some TVs put in the dining area showing Telemundo Spanish soap operas. I cannot get enough of the drama."}
{"text":"All in all, it was pretty good. The service was good, the margaritas were good, but the food was just okay. Starting with the service - we were greeted immediately by a friendly hostess. The could have seated us immediately, but we choose to sit at the bar. The bartender was also very friendly and attentive. I ordered whichever margarita was on special, and although it was pre-mixed, it was delicious. The food on the other hand was a little disappointing. I thought my quesadillas were a bit bland, but my friend loved her carnitas nachos, so maybe it was an off-night for quasadillas.

I'll be back for more margaritas, and will update my review if I change my mind about the food."}
{"text":"Emilano's is a great place to come for drinks, it's a cozy atmosphere with excellent service.  The prices are very reasonable and you can get a 32 oz dos equus for $8 or a tasty olympic swimming pool sized margarita fishbowl for just a little more.  I'd come here for drinks any time, but I'd save my appetite for somewhere more deserving.

It's reasonably priced, but very processed and definitely not made from scratch.  Everything is very salty, but lacking in any other kick or flavor.  We got the sampler platter, and despite the fact that it had 6 different things including burritos, tacos, enchiladas, and tamales on it, they all tasted bland, processed and virtually identical.  Nothing here was bad, but it never ventured into the great zone either.  

Bland food, great service and drinks.  Come thirsty, not hungry, and you'll have a wonderful night at Emilianos!"}
{"text":"Stopped here today to have a happy hour Marg and snack, but turned out they changed their happy menu. Suffice to say, it's sad."}
{"text":"Of the local Mexican chains, it's right thurr with Patrón and El Campesino...maybe even a hair better. There are daily lunch + drink specials and with its location in the 'Sahside,' I guess it should be expected that happy hour can get extra rowdy in the bar area. I'd go so far as to say celebrating-birthdays-at-Chi-Chi's distracting. It's the usual, broad assortment of value burritos, enchiladas, quesadillas and fajitas. Even the vegetarian can find a happy place with their choice of fillings. Service has always been pleasant and you get your food muy rápido! You can always ask for more chips 'n salsa so there's no excuse for leaving hungry."}
{"text":"I haven't been to the Emiliano's in the North Side (that many people have recommended to me), but the one on Carson in the South Side was very good. A step up in quality and taste, I have gotten take out from them several times, and have never been disappointed. The tamales in particular were moist and tasty - something that is easily and often overcooked. My chile rellenos were also very good. I recomment the Emiliano's Special which is huge with many different typical mexican dishes, and will satisfy just about anyones appetite."}
{"text":"It's hard to pick a favorite server, they are all outstanding, the experience is always great, we have been going down the south side location for 7 years, we enjoy it so much that we are there 2-3 times a week and we bring them a cookie platter about 4 times a year. We enjoy Bollo, Martin, Lisa, Nina, etc. we also Miss Melissa and Gabriel. They all know us down there, the food is always great.

{"text":"This is really Americanized, tex-mex style food but it's really good, nonetheless.  I stopped in with two friends on a Saturday night and had a few minute wait, so we grabbed drinks at the bar.  I ordered the sangria margarita which was delicious, strong, and priced well at $6.99.  I would definitely go back for more of those yummy drinks!  A few minutes after sitting down, our table was ready.  I had the taco salad clasico with chicken.  It was very tasty, loved the tender shredded chicken in the salad.  Service was decent and the food was very good!  I would definitely return to Emiliano's!"}
{"text":"Came here with a huuuuge group of 18 people, and we were seated instantly, orders taken, served, bam, bam, bam. Our waiter was incredibly friendly, if a tad on the demure side. Free chips and salsa for all, did anyone mention that? OF COURSE THEY DID because it is very nearly a phenomenon in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. (Can we get the Mexican Restaurant League of Carbohydrate Advocates on this? What is the deal?) I myself was seduced by their incredibly sensuous (yes) guacamole, which goes for only 2.99 a bowl, as opposed to the national mean of 4.99 (Christine-generated statistics. I've been to Texas. And California. Hey!). It was amazing. I almost ordered it again, but then I saw churros sticking out of a martini glass filled with ice cream and was intrigued...but then I ordered flan with ice cream because I wanted to try the homemade flan instead. The flan itself was not the texture I am used to...it was more like extra firm tofu, but the caramel sauce was caramel-y? I had a chicken fajita from my neighbor's plate and it was good, but I thought perhaps they could benefit by making their own flour tortillas? Always fluffier, always impress in a Mexican restaurant. Prices are on the steeper end, but, once again, must be a Pittsburgh thing (what is the DEAL?). Next time I will be going straight for the sangria margarita I've heard so much about, and laying waste to more chips."}
{"text":"I would give Emiliano's 15 stars if I could! I can't say enough good things about this establishment.  To start, their staff is the best around. Exceptionally personable. Not many places are enthusiastic about serving a table of 7 that include 3 toddlers and a three year old- Emiliano's always is! Yep. Not just nice. Enthusiastic about our presence and light hearted about the kids being kids. We've gone more than once for lunch with our crew and they're always happy to see us. And laugh whenever our kids do something ridiculous and I assure you, they do. 

As for the food.  And drinks. Oh. My. Goodness. It is delicious. It's hard to review Emiliano's because the menu has so many amazing things happening. 

To start. The fajitas.  They're filling. This is a real fajita.  An abundant amount of meat is served with grilled veggies of your choice. My personal order is chicken with peppers. No onion. 
My dad orders the Emiliano's specialty fajita. This is when you add bacon and cheese to your fajita. I haven't tried it but he swears by it. 

Platters- so good. Filling. It's hard to choose which is best. The Mexican chicken is a spicy chicken that's extraordinary. Serves with beans and tortilla it's a meal everyone should order once if you enjoy heat. 

Make your own combination- yay! Always a favorite. Deciding what to order at Emiliano's is almost impossible. Especially after you've sampled multiple items. How can one decide what to get? Well order the combination meal and you can put together your own combination. Oh the endless choices. 

I could write a 20 chapter novel just on Emiliano's Combination strategies and reviews. Here would be my highlights- to start. The staff is patient and will answer questions. So ask away.  I always order chicken options. So I love the tacos! All of the Enchiladas are awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed with this place. The cucumber margarita was excellent! My friend ordered a steak burrito and I had the Arroz con Camarones. We were both very pleased with our dinner and will definitely be back in the near future!"}
