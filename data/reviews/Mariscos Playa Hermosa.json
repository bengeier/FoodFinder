{"text":"Great flavor and service. Excellent fish dishes. Clean and friendly."}
{"text":"One of my favorite mariscos (seafood) places in the valley. Their avocado salsa is amazing. They make incredible micheladas (which is surprisingly difficult for a lot of Mexican restaurants). Their cocktails are delicious. The restaurant is very clean. My only complaint is that parking can be difficult to find, but still, if you're craving refreshing sea food, I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"A fun place to eat! We had so much fun dining her on a Friday night. Live Marachi music, friendly staff and great seafood. The Pulpo with Ranchero sauce is a killer. The seafood cocktail is a Soup of wonderful ingredients. Definitely worth a rerun!"}
{"text":"Three of us dined here Saturday. Their parking lot is small, the neighbor is not upscale, but it seemed ok. We all agreed the ceviche is great. The whole grilled fish was very good as was the breaded fish fillet. The crab enchiladas were horrible. The sauce tasted burnt and the crab meat had a very fishy taste. The side dishes were all the same: rice and beans and small salad. The rice and beans were tasteless and bland. The salad was iceberg lettuce and not much more. We may come back for the ceviche and to try some of their other entrees. The cost of most of the entrees is around $13-$14. The best part of the evening was the large supermarket we discovered , just before I -10, it has a large food court, ceviche bar, Mexican bakery and all sorts of specialty items used in Mexican, Carribean, and Latino cooking. The staff is friendly, the place is well organized, clean,and it was a  fun place to browse and shop."}
{"text":"Good place. Ceviche was okay.. The last time I had ceviche was at senior frog .. This did not come upto those levels.. Passable in any case.. The whole fish dish was  good..."}
{"text":"Great place! Excellent service..was in town visiting family and decided to get a bite to eat ..very happy with my choice! Had tostada de ceviche and tacos... definitely coming back."}
{"text":"If I lived near this restaurant I would be there all the time. They make the most refined yet homey sauces (especially the camarones culichi, or shrimp in green poblano sauce is addictive), serve freshly fried puffy tortilla chips, delicious ceviche tostadas on the house, and perfect shrimp tacos. The atmosphere is warm, festive and neighborly, no pretensions and the prices reflect this. There is a full bar, huge draft beers with lots of lime, and very hospitable service. I haven't enjoyed such a wide array of flavors, amazing Mexican style seafood outside of Mexico, even in San Diego which comes close."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the fish dish I ordered. I would definitely come again. I want to try their shrimp cocktails, I spoke to the waiter and he assured me that they don't put ketchup in their cocktails.  That to me is a sign of good taste. The waiter also gave me a free ceviche tostada to try. I also received a free slice of cake compliments of yelp. The taste was fantastic so far."}
{"text":"Good food but terrible waitresses. I had to get up two times to ask for more drinks and tortillas. I know it was a busy Sunday but that doesn't excuse the terrible customer service.  It ruined my entire meal with the family.  I don't think I'll be back.  Buena comida, pero muy mal meseras. Me tuve que levantar dos veces para pedir más bebidas y tortillas.Tengo en cuenta que era un domingo ocupado pero eso no es una excusa para un servicio al cliente tan terrible. No vuelvo a regresar a este lugar.  Owners of this place please hire more competent waitresses. I think you need it."}
{"text":"The food isn't anything special. It's not bad food either  It could be way better food for the  prices your paying. I really do like the decor very colorful and so many stuff to look at on the walls. The Mariachi guys are Loud!!! And funny definitely make you smile. Come here for a good time don't expect much from the food."}
{"text":"Well worth trying!    Great unique tastes in the heart of Phoenix.   Chips and salsa -- solid Ceviche -- really good Carmarones Culchi -- this is the dish to order.  Sauce is incredible.  Generous portions, reasonable prices.  Nice staff.  Will definitely return when in AZ."}
{"text":"Great food, great service...  Ate outside on a warm and balmy evening. The waitresses checked on us regularly and no request was too much. They love to cook seafood and they are great at it.  Wonderful evening"}
{"text":"Wow, from the street it looks a little rough. But I noticed that the parking lot had been freshly hosed down and was spotless. As soon as we entered I knew we were in for a treat. A wonderful friendly atmosphere and all of the chairs and tables were hand painted in Mexican folk art. The place was immaculate.  We had called for a reservation for 12 people and our table was ready for us and we were immediately offered chips, 2 types of salsa and waters.  There were so many wonderful things to try on the menu that we all ordered something different. After we ordered we were given some of the best cevichi I have ever as an appetizer (no charge)!  Even though the kitchen had to prepare 12 different plates, they all came out together.  EVERYTHING was very carefully made and delicious. By far some of the finest Mexican food in the valley. We travel in Mexico often and have had many wonderful meals there. Imagine going to 16th street and Roosevelt for something even better.  The service was VERY friendly and timely. It felt like we were eating at my Grandmother's house!  Hands down, my new favorite Mexican Restaurant"}
{"text":"First time tonight...and was extremely pleased. Excellent service, fun decor and outstanding food. I had the mix grilled fish/chicken/meat that had a wonderful creamy tomatillo sauce in the middle filled with octopus..this was like a mexican pupu platter!! Enough for 2, have leftovers. I love the complimentary cerviche taco they bring after ordering our margaritas...definitely a will go again soon..."}
{"text":"The service was pretty fast. I was not too impressed with food. Ordered the culichi shrimp and a consume. My rice was undercooked, there was literally 5 shrimps in the green sauce. The sauce was very watered down. My consume was pretty flavorless, I added salt and limes sadly it didn't help. It was not the best I had but not the worst. Would not come here again."}
{"text":"Mariscos on a Friday night is awesome! Our waitress, Brenda, was super cool to tres gringos! Molcajete was amazing, as well as the shrimp caliche and BACON WRAPPED SHRIMP! Their flan is also good, if they happen to have it."}
{"text":"After the fish tacos here, I feel like I haven't had them anywhere else. So good. The ceviche tostada and crab enchiladas--packed with crabmeat--were absolutely delicious.   The ambience was bright, draft beer was deep, and service perfect. The owner even comped us tostadas. This place deserves another star!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and just finally got the time to tell everyone about the delicious food this place has to offer.   I have eaten a variety of their plates and everything has been amazing. Their cocktail shrimp is great. Shrimp and Pescado ceviche is clutch! I enjoyed every bite. Camarones a la crema de broccoli is amazing. I thought it sounded weird at first, but once I digged in I wanted more after each bite. I really want to try every plate!  My 5 year old nephew is a VERY picky eater. I don't think he's ever tried seafood and liked it, but I somehow got him (okay forced him) to have camarones a la plancha once. Whabam! He LOVED the camarones a la plancha. He refuses to eat any other shrimp if it isn't like how playa hermosa prepares them.  Went during happy hour and got SUPER CHEAP Negra Modelo. They have soccer games playing, so enjoy a nice michelada or beer watching your favorite team.   The service is great too. The owners are super nice. They really care about their customers.   The place is in shady looking area, but don't let that frighten you. The place is a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"SO GOOD!  Ceviche was amazing., seriously. Incredibly fresh and simple. The hot shrimp?  Hot as hell and perfect. Even the Bloody Mary was ridiculously good. We got there at the crack of 5:00pm and it was packed (that's how you know it's good) and were seated right away. It's no fuss, no muss service. No BS, just great food, helpful service and frequent check backs. That's it. And that's all you need."}
{"text":"Cannot love this place more. It does not look nice outside but the inside is amazing. A full Mexican experience. We had two fishes. One is whole fish and one is fish with salsa topped. Both are good! If you like crispy, the whole fish is what you want; if you like spicy, the salsa one is your choice!Just the service needs to be better, we wait for 15m to get water and drinks. A great place the hang out with friends. Also, the chips are bomb! They are served warm!! I love this place! Besides, it is near the ranch market. If you want to buy some grocery after a lunch or dinner, go there!!"}
{"text":"The bright decor soon gives way to best mariscos I have had in Phoenix; you have a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Took my in-laws yesterday because they were willing to be adventurous, they were very impressed.  The place is always packed, it's noisy but so welcoming.  As soon as you sit down, a waiter comes to take your drinks order and then come the green and red salsa with chips.  The green salsa is delicious.  A few minutes later, your server brings you a ceviche tostada which is complimentary, what a great way to make a customer feel welcomed and wanting to come back for more.  We have tried several dishes and none have disappointed so far.  My husband usually has the \"mojarra frita\" it is absolutely delicious.  Their \"seven seas\" soups is excellent.  Wonderful staff, very friendly and they continuously check on us without being annoying.  Even though some feel it's not located in a nice area, we have always felt safe.  It seems that they will be expanding their restaurant, I'm sure that is due to the fact that their service and food is amazing.  Good luck, Mariscos Playa Hermosa!"}
{"text":"Had the Grande Mix Cocktail, Shrimp wrapped in Bacon, and the famous 7 Sea Soup.  One of the ingredient in the cocktail probably has seen its better days, cause it was unpleasantly fishy and bitter. Shrimp wrapped in Bacon (Shrimp Fantasia) was decent, but I had better at other places. 7 Sea soup was average, thought I think I will like it a lot more if the soup is served warmer than room temperature.   One last thing, Mexican cuisine usually pairs with tons of lime as garnish and flavoring especially when it comes to seafood. And almost all Mexican restaurants (or taco trucks) i been to seem to shared the talents of picking out the juiciest limes  that's ever grown. Well, not this place. One interesting I encountered today after decades of Mexican food experience was how dry their lime were. Most of them won't even budge one drop of juice for me. Wonder if that would make the difference for the cocktail or the soup?"}
{"text":"Awesome place. After landing in Phoenix and having a craving for Mexican food, we drove to Mariscos Playa Hermosa. The restaurant was packed, but we had no problem getting a table. There was also a mariachi band that was playing music from 7-8pm, which was a pleasant surprise. I got an horchata to start off, which was amazing! Not too sweet, which a nice, but not overpowering kick of cinnamon. Highly recommend if you're a fan of horchata.  We ordered the Ceviche de Pescado as an appetizer, which was delicious and had a nice flavor from the fresh fish mixing with the cilantro and salsa. The fish was a little rubbery, but all the flavors still melded together well.  For our main courses, we ordered the Camarones culichi and Pescado a la veracruzana. Both came with a side of salad, homemade beans, rice, and fresh corn or flour tortillas. The shrimp was absolutely delicious, and the green sauce had a nice cilantro flavor to it. The only complaint we had was that the portion size was a little small for 3 people, and it was so good that we really wanted more. The fish was lightly breaded and sauteed, and was moist and succulent. The vegetables complemented the dish well too.   If you're in Phoenix and have a craving for Mexican seafood, I highly recommend Mariscos Playa Hermosa!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great atmosphere and food .  Always bring my guests here when they visit.  Imagine fresh authentic seafood in the desert."}
{"text":"I stuffed my face here and it was great. Had a blue colored fish taco and a giant seafood dish. All fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food......a great  place to go with the family and friends....not a doubt they have the best molcajete in town!!!!"}
{"text":"Authentic food, friendly service and the best mariscos! Must try and bring some friends! Their Margaritas and Micheladas are great!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The decor was great! The service was very good.  The food was good, but not exceptional. We expected the prices to be much lower than they were.  Overall, it is good and we would eat there again, but we wouldn't go out of our way."}
{"text":"So my husband and I were looking for someplace to celebrate our anniversary. We both love seafood and found this place. It reminded us of the first time we went to Mexico together so many years ago. The chips and salsa, especially the green salsa (in my opinion) were very good. We shared the molcajete and it was so very delicious. The green salsa in the middle is extremely tasty. I have no idea what is in it, but I would eat it again. The hubby had the $5 mug of Tecate and I had a Corona margarita. We definitely plan to come back!! The service was attentive and helpful, since it was our first visit I asked a lot of questions and our waitress was patient! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ditto to all the positive reviews out there.  This place rocks.  The outside actually isn't THAT bad, but yes, I would hesitate to go in if it weren't for all the fantastic reviews on yelp.  Once inside, it is just as all the pretty yelp pictures depict: a clean and bright dining room with colorful tables and chairs.  My friend and I ordered the mixed seafood cocktail and the shrimp culichi.  Both were super tasty, as were the complimentary ceviche tostadas.  The culichi sauce was so good that I had to stop myself from drinking it.  The seafood cocktail was very refreshing - just what is needed during the Phoenix summer.  It had shrimp, oysters, clams, abalone, calamari, and octopus.  Almost all the seafood was fresh and sweet, and the dish was huge.  The only critique is I can do without the clams.  They are the tiny canned ones instead of the fresh ones like I had in the cocktails in Mexico.  Service was really good as well.  Overall, this was a very pleasant experience.  I will be back and I am telling everyone I know about this new find."}
{"text":"Very good food. Very good atmosphere!!! We will definitely come back!!! The tostadas and the fried fish were excellent. The fish was very moisture."}
{"text":"This place is the best Mexican seafood I've found in Phoenix! Delicious chips with two kinds of salsas, plus they bring complimentary shrimp ceviche tostadas that are superb! The Camarones Culichi, one of their specialty dishes, is OUTRAGEOUSLY good! You'll finish all the shrimp and then want to sop up the rest of the sauce with their fresh homemade tortillas! My only complaint is that the beans served with the dish were cold. If you go for lunch and aren't a huge eater, be sure to ask for the lunch portions, which are half the price listed on the menu! The atmosphere is wonderfully festive, much nicer than you'd expect from the outside, and the service is prompt and friendly. There's good reason for the numerous plaques and articles of praise adorning the walls (including a 5 star review from Seftel back in '04)!"}
{"text":"Awesome - lunch back for dinner the same week - fish is fresh and great variety of seafood!"}
{"text":"This is a small place that specializes in authentic Mexican seafood dishes.  The draft beer Negra Modella can be had in a full pint (now that's a heavy mug!),  The chips and salsa are top notch.  The staff is friendly and does not look at you funny for being gringo.  The decor is over the top mexican loud colors down to the painted wooden chairs.  Not too loud inside, can have a conversation without raising ones voice.  You might need a reservation on the weekend but I have never had a problem at lunch after 1pm."}
{"text":"Best tortillas I have ever had! I can go to this place and just order tortillas lol. They also have the nicest waiters, always checking on us even though it was crowded. First time visiting AZ, I had high expectations on their Mexican food, they did not disappoint! Their prices a bit higher than what I'm use to but nevertheless the food was good."}
{"text":"Expected a lot with all the hype. Was good, but probably won't go back.  Parking very limited.  Margaritas all ice! Food was tasty but not anything that made us say wow. Good service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Excellent service!! Quick and tasty, one of the best places in Phoenix. Came on a busy Sunday afternoon and offered a complimentary tostada de ceviche which was delicious! Two thimbs up"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that the people who I dealt with here were very polite and hospitable. But, they seated us and forgot about us. We sat for about 10-12 min before we asked someone if we could order (after looking the menus over and deciding on a plate), so we ordered our drinks and food at the same time. The wait for the food was long as well.  Our plates were expensive for what we got in return. I ordered Pescado a la Diabla, which is a fish filet in spicy sauce. The sauce was not at all spicy, not to my standards anyway, and it was salty. It came with beans, rice & salad, but a very small portion of each. There were four of us who dined here and everyone said their food was just okay. The chips were stale and the salsa tasted too much like tomato, there was no spice to it. Our table had no napkins and we had to ask for our silverware after we were given our food.  The location is not very big and feels crowded inside. It was so loud it was hard to hear the waitress or the people at my table.  There are no baby changing stations in the restroom. Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Pinch me I have died an gone to heaven...!!! Going to the Circus found  this treasure on yelp and I'm a better person for it...!! Cant wait to come back..."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing! I had never been to a Mexican restaurant that specializes in seafood, but I'm glad I checked it out.  We got the house speciality, which is a pot with chicken, steak, tilapia, shrimp and octopus in a tomato based sauce with cheese.  It also came with rice, beans and a little salad. I would order it diabla, as it is spicy but not too spicy.  Also the drinks are super cheap! A 24oz beer was only $6. Wow. You need to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Typical \"hole in the wall\" mexican restaurant. Usually packed during lunch/dinner hours. The food is delicious! If you love seafood and mexican food, this is a great place. Their ceviche is fantastic and entrees Are great too. Large selection of drinks including margaritas. If you don't mind waiting, this is a great find."}
{"text":"Excellent decor, very small with a great \"Mom n Pop\" feel, beautifully painted and warm, and the food trumps all those compliments.  AMAZING SEAFOOD!!!!! Try everything, I loved the oysters and the Crab Enchilada. I grew up in Maryland and I am a picky crab lover there is, this seafood gets 5 stars easily.  UPDATE JAN 2018: The quality has deteriorated and this place is not what it used to be. The food was not good on my last visit, the entrees were COVERED in cheese(never used to be) and the taste was nothing like it was a year ago. Nothing left to say, will not be returning here. Sad."}
{"text":"We were surprised of how clean and nicely decorated this place was after seeing the neighborhood it's in. The food is delish, tastes homemade but a little too salty, so only 4 stars. Service was great and very affordable. The menu has dinner prices so lunch was about 60% of the dinner cost.   We found this place for lunch after arriving at Phoenix airport."}
{"text":"I went to many Mexican restaurants and this one is a gem! The service is awesome. They have really good ceviche de pescado and molcajete caliente. We ordered the house margarita and mango diablo. They are really good!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place!!  I've been here so many times, you know I love my mariscos.  Playa Hermosa has never disappointed me.  There quality is very consistent and I would be soooo sad if they ever stop their business.  Let me give them 10 stars out of 5.  They are that good!  Please don't be discouraged because of the area it's in.  I know some people would never come to this part of town...they are missing out!    I love walking into the restaurant to their colorful decors.  Once you are seated, you will get a generous portion of freshly made warm tortilla chips with a red and a green salsa, no questions asked.  They don't care if you're going to order later on...here, have some chips and salsa!  They have a full bar and a TV with sports playing all the time.  Now you can have some drinks with free chips and salsa while watching a game.  Once you order, they will bring you a tostada with ceviche.  It's on the house.  Their ceviche is fresh and flavorful without being overpowered by excessive lime.  As for entrees, I would recommend.... - shrimp culichi - fish tacos - grilled shrimp - fried fish in garlic sauce - molcajete - any types of ceviche  Most dishes come with a side of beans, rice, salad, and flour/corn tortillas.  Be prepared to walk out with a full belly plus some to take home."}
{"text":"Food very mediocre and service was very slow. Although only few tables were filled, took forever for drinks and food.   Nice environment though."}
{"text":"To start off \"best in town\" that is definitely a big statement to back up.. \"Best of Phoenix\" is an even bigger one.  Typically yelpers are not from the Hispanic community.   Because of my Hispanic palette I would say that this place has very bland food.  Watered down shrimp cocktail, and al pastor tacos that were really not flavorful.  The restaurant itself is nice and cozy. Decorated very well and Mexico City looking with lots of color..  Staff is very nice.  But there are definitely better Mexican sea food places."}
{"text":"This place is wondrous. It's in the hood but that makes the experience all that better. Walking in you're greeted with a burst of colorful decor in a cozy little space.  It was pretty quiet for a Thursday evening which was fine by me. Margs were yummy, food was spendid and reminded me of being in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. I ordered the fish, shrimp combo. To die for. The shrimp was seasoned to perfection. I will definitely be back with a group so we can spread the word on this hidden gem. I also will add that they do have a patio that is dog friendly (I'm dog obsessed). Go here. You will not be dissapointed. This place is authentic. Buenos dias."}
{"text":"Sometimes you have to explore and try those hole in the places. Sometimes you get junk and other times, if your lucky. You get a place like this. I was astounded yes I said it ASTOUNDED. By how authentic and delicious this place is. If you haven't come here you haven't had real Mexican seafood. Trust me you have to come here. Chase out"}
{"text":"Fish tacos were perfect. Crispy. Flavorful. Excellent salsa. Didn't like the margaritas otr. Had an odd taste. Service was slow and didn't get guacamole after 2 requests. But the topper was the outrageously loud mariachi band, amped up to really kill your ear drums."}
{"text":"I thought that the Ceviche was amazing, so fresh and delightful!  I also loved the beans!  Excellent quality and so so fresh!"}
{"text":"First, let me say, this is the first real authentic Mexican restaurant I've experienced since I've moved to Phoenix.  The only reason I'm giving a 4 is because I didn't love the salsas but everything else was amazing!  we ordered the shrimp ceviche to start (fresh and very tasty) and chorizo queso.   Came out still bubbling from kitchen on a cast iron grill...soooo good with their tortilla chips!  Because we ordered 2 apps, we split an entree (didn't want to leave with leftovers as we were going shopping for a few hours after).  We ordered the shrimp caramon culichi with a mix of corn and flour tortillas.  I usually don't order flour tortillas but glad I did (based on another yelper rec), soft and not too thick or doughy.  Everything was fresh and came out super fast!!  We also received a free coconut cake slice for checking in on Yelp....Their cake is probably the best white cake I've ever had!! It ended the meal perfectly and was a good size portion to split! I will definitely be back! Thanks so much for an amazing, authentic Mexican meal! Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"OH man, you can't go wrong here. The food is always so good, fresh and served hot. The service is delightful. My favorites are the crab enchiladas (that red sauce is bananas good, almost as good as my mom makes it) and the shrimp culichi. This place is an institution for a reason!"}
{"text":"This a great restaurant.  In Phoenix in business and found this place on Yelp.  It was pretty close to The Crowne Plaza at the airport.  Huge portions and truly authentic!!  Couldn't finish everything.  Had the Tostada with shrimp & octopus, followed by some great enchiladas!!!!"}
{"text":"My in laws dragged us here and let me just say I'm so happy they did!! Everything was great the moment we walked in, the service, the food and especially the alcoholic drinks! Being very picky when it comes to sea food, this place reached all my high standards. My mother in law got a cheese and chorizo dip, which I never had anywhere else before and that was amazing, probably because it came out with crispy edges and a melted to perfection middle. If you are a fan of seafood/spicey this is the place to go! Only thing they could change is possibly adding more space for all these satisfied customers. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend during the week and it was a nice surprise. The service was excellent and we had margaritas made to order. I had the tacos gobernador (shrimp and cheese) and they were excellent."}
{"text":"Wow!! Talk about good food and mariachis.  Would recommend and definitely coming back here again"}
{"text":"It's like Jesus himself came down from heaven and brought the freshest sea food he could find. The shrimp, crab, pulpo and the carne asada are Aaaaamazing!   My favs: Mar y Tierra, Carne Asada burrito in red enchilada sauce.   The wife favs: Crab enchilada with red sauce"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time with my fiance and the food was delicious. I liked that the mariachi was there serenading everyone. The servers were also very attentive and kept checking on us. Great place to eat seafood"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers for such honest reviews.  We came here today hoping reviews were true and we are very pleased.  The food here is Delicious!!!! Service was great, very family friendly environment, clean with a nice patio dining area.  Very authentic favors...we will definitely be back with the rest of the family.  Thanks for the free ceviche tostada and check-in slice of chocolate cake...you made a fan of my picky eating 6yr old son."}
{"text":"This is a great Mexican restaurant. Big portion sizes, very tasty dishes! Awesome margaritas! Our waitress Brenda was super helpful. A+"}
{"text":"There is no complaining. Parking..Just find a spot even if it's on the street. Seating..Pick a color and your table will await. Staff is friendly and happy to make you happy. The food here is joyous! If you want good seafood melded in authentic Mexican flavors, just come and explore. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place had great seafood. I had the mixed cocktail and my husband had the shrimp cocktail. My husband said he had tons of shrimp in his. The place is small and cozy. The neighborhood doesn't look all that great but the food was good. The prices seem to be very reasonable, but then we are used to paying California prices. The parking lot was a little small but we have a large truck. Loved the decor. We were leaving as the mariachis were arriving, too bad. Definitely check this place out if you are near Downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Friendly and knowledgable servers, great food, music and ambiance. Do not be put off by the mostly fish menu, it's super fresh and you can try something new. Good prices and great fun."}
{"text":"There are a lot of really good Mexican restaurants in the valley of the sun, but this place stands out in my opinion.  When you walk in you'll notice the vibrant colors and beautiful decor.  They have couple of TV's in the place.  The place was very clean, and had a good vibe in the area.  The food was fresh and service was top notch.  Food-A Service-A Cleanliness-A Prices-Moderate   ."}
{"text":"I was disappointed. The crab enchiladas were watery and unimpressive, and the whole fried fish, while very crisp, was dry and tasteless. I would probably not go back."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am Mexican so I don't eat at 'Mexican restaurants' often but Im glad I stopped here. This is true Mexican seafood with great taste and very nice ambience. The waitresses were very nice and attentive but not to an annoying level. I would definitely go back with family and friends and 0lan on doing so."}
{"text":"Great find on my way to airport.  Outdoor patio is beautiful, service was great, fish tacos and a corona made it a perfect early lunch.  Great homemade chips and salsa to start, with 5 hot sauces in each table to choose from.  Bonus is a friendly cat hanging around the patio."}
{"text":"If your love seafood and are craving mexican food, this place is it! Don't let the outside or surrounding buildings intimidate you. The food is well worth the trip!  With free chips and salsa and also a delicious free bit of their ceviche while you order and wait, ya really can't go wrong! Its a bit small inside but perfectly sized for a nice peaceful meal without the room full of loud customes that normally comes with a great restaurant. The staff is friendly, and the mood is colorfully relaxing. I live in E. Mesa and its even worth the drive! :-)"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place I want to go back again and again. There are so many amazing things on the menu. Fish of all kinds, prepared in all sorts of traditions. Shrimps, etc.. And Modello Negro on TAP. yeah man. And the people were really friendly - clearly a family run place. LOVE IT."}
{"text":"We really enjoy the seafood here.  Our favorites are fried fish with diabla sauce (really hot!) and fried fish with culichi sauce.  The ceviche tostada is great too!  Our sons like the fajitas.  I have recommended it to my sister and family when they travel to phoenix.  We have been coming here for years."}
{"text":"We came here for cinco de mayo.  This place was amazing with great service.  Our server Milsha was great.  I'd recommend the breaded shrimp plate and shrimp tostadas.  Don't forget to check in so you can get a free piece of cake for dessert."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant!  The food is simply too wonderful to describe.  Our goal is to sample every item on the menu.  They all sound wonderful.  If you love seafood prepared with style and imagination, you should check out this place."}
{"text":"I only know about one dish here, but it is my favorite dish in all of Phoenix.  I always order the calamari, shrimp, and octopus in a garlic sauce, and it is the best thing I've ever eaten.  $18.00 and worth every penny.  It comes with beans, rice, and salad, and these too are amazing.  I don't usually eat rice or beans, but I'm never able to stop myself from eating these because they're so delicious.    I'm not a big fan of the interior or exterior of the restaurant -- it's very colorful, and extremely detailed (almost the sort of detail that hurts my eyes).  But I come here for the food."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot. Thanks Yelp! We ordered the molcajete  with diablo sauce - be warned! it really is spicy. Not called diablo for nothing. The flavor was still there and I love spicy, but next time I'll try the tomatillo. Bit too painful for me. ( I ordered a horchata to try and help numb my swollen tongue) I really love the side of beans,salad and rice. Beans are perfectly seasoned, salad is tangy and refreshing, and the rice has texture. Not the pink puffy rice with minimal flavor that is served at so many mexican restaurants. They also have strong margaritas and huge mugs of draft beer.  Just seeing the pictures makes me want to go there now!"}
{"text":"I've been trying out variety of seafood places, this location is cozy, clean. We had oisters \"preparados\" which means they add a slice of avocado and a large raw shrimp and thin slice of purple onion. We also tried the shrimp and cucumber appetizer with a special sauce that tasted good with a hint of soy sauce. The garlic shrimp came with a decent portion of shrimp and rice and beans on the side. The shrimp was swimming in garlic butter,bell pepper, onion and seasoning. The ceviche tostada was tasty and the micheladas were ok, I prefer to have them with lots of lime chili seasoning and plenty of Clamato. The salsa and chips are good the beans and rice we're great. I love the variety of options they have available and I would definitely come for more."}
{"text":"I was in Arizona for the weekend visiting my cousin and this was the best last meal we could have together! I can honestly say those are the best fish tacos I've ever had plus their cilantro/lemon/guac salsa is amazing! The waitresses went out of their way to make sure we where comfortable and that my cousins kids where happy. Plus, the place wasnt packed at all and the atmosphere was wonderful with all the bright fun colors."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican seafood restaurant I've been to.  Yum, yum, yum.  I loved the chips and green salsa.  The draft beer comes in a huge margarita-like glass, enough for two people to share if you don't want too much to drink.    The Camarones Culichi was heavenly.  The service is friendly and prompt.  The atmosphere is warm and cozy, yet also festive.  The prices are extremely reasonable, especially given the quality of the food and the complimentary ceviche before the main entree.  Absolutely everything was delicious.  This place should be packed on a Saturday night, although it's okay with me if just a few people know about this culinary gem.  I want to try their tequila have my next birthday celebration here--drinks, awesome food, friendly staff--sounds like the perfect place for a party."}
{"text":"This place is INCREDIBLE! I stumbled upon this restaurant through Yelp and it's raving reviews - well everything the hundreds have said before me is true...you MUST try this place out!"}
{"text":"I was kinda disappointed after reading all the great yelping on this restaurant.  We were in two weeks ago on a Sunday.  The inside is nice with a comfortable ambiance.  I ordered the Camarones al Mojo de ajo...sad to say, nothing special nor did a I get that great garlicy flavor.  If anything there was mostly bell pepper as filler, I didn't dam order fajita style so what's with so much bell pepper and onion???  Rice and beans were good, but just a doppling of both, really??!!  I also ordered the shrimp ceviche as an appetizer, again it was just meh.  Nothing really stood out, other than the limey juice and again, it was more of pico de gallo all mixed in that was another filler.  Maybe it was just an off day, but nothing special.  I still love San Carlos Bay on McDowell Road.  I have been going there since the early 90's and the have the best tasting seafood dishes.  Only down side is that they are cash only.  My daughter ordered a shrimp cocktail, hoping it would taste similar to those in Rocky Point, she told me that it was nothing special.  My niece ordered chicken enchiladas and nothing seafood, but said they were the best enchiladas she's had.  Go figure!!"}
{"text":"The outside of this restaurant does not look like much, but the inside of the restaurant feels very festive and exciting. Our waiter was quiet nice. Right after you are seated, you get a bowl of chips with 2 dips: a red spicy one and a green, sort of mild one (it is not guacamole, by the way). Then, after you order, you are served a complementary fish cerviche, which is quiet tasty. We ordered the fried Tilapia,  the shrimp in green sauce, and the shrimp with peppers. All came with beans, rice, and a salad on the side. The fried Tilapia was quite large, it could feed at least 2 people. The outside was very crisp and the inside tender and steamy. The shrimp in green sauce was like a soup, and it was very good, creamy and the shrimp was tender, The shrimp with peppers were excellent also and were served with tortillas (wheat tortillas or corn tortillas, your choice.)"}
{"text":"We ordered the molcajete caliente it was very good had lots of flavor to all the food that was in it ,the horchata was very good to they put some fruit in it ,the waiter was very nice and we got a free 3 leches cake"}
{"text":"The best restaurant in phx! We landed in airport, we were not sure where to go so we decided to choose this one and wow the waiter was so friendly especially with communication method. We use sign language. She's learning as she is serving us! Brenda, the waiter, had made our day already! The food was beyond delicious! Just like my mom's homemade Mexican food."}
{"text":"Although I'm from the midwest, I consider myself well traveled. This was the best Mexican I've ever had. You know you are off to a good start when the salsa is amazing. They gave a complementary salmon ceviche as well to start. I ordered the fish with two sauces, half cilantro sauce the other half chipotle sauce. Huge portion. The fish was fried and cooked to perfection. With my one night in Phoenix I'm so happy I went here."}
{"text":"We went to this quaint little place for the first time and were very pleased.  We started with two different types of cerviche, shrimp and fish, both with a nice mix of veggies and spices.  We then asked for a split bowl of the seven seas soup, which they willingly split. The two split bowls were almost as much soup as one regular bowl.  As advertised, there were seven types of seafood combined with a few vegetables and was delicious.  After almost having a full meal already we opted  for a the fish with poblano.  We also requested double salad  instead of beans and rice, and again were accommodated.  The base was very lightly breaded and topped with a mixture of poblano pepper, tomato, and onion, which blend nicely with the fish.  The server was very pleasant, helpful, and checked with us at the right times.  When the bill was presented we were amazed by the low total.     The atmosphere, service and food were all top notch.  We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Everything was DELICIOUS!  We're from out of town and found this little gem through Yelp.  They give you complimentary chips and salsa and ceviche and tostada with your entree order.  Service was great as well, very attentive and accommodating.  Great restaurant!  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"the food was delicious!!! drove all the way from casa grande just to eat here!! service was great !!! our waitress was prompt and met all our food needs !! will definitely come back !!!"}
{"text":"I've tried several of their dishes. It's ok.  I did like their cocktail de camaron but nothing special."}
{"text":"Amazing! The food is fantastic, the service is  spot on and the live mariachi is the cherry on top. I would highly recommend making a stop here. We will definitely be coming back... and ordering the camarones culichi every single time we come!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Mexican food, but this place changed my mind!!!  The food was UNBELIEVABLE, the service was fantastic, and the staff was very friendly...  DEFINITELY try this place if you are in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"Really like this place for Mariscos. The restaurant isn't in the best part of town, the location is a bit sketchy, however, the the food is very good! Some of my favs are the shrimp cocktail and cerviché. Oysters and Mexican beer...Yum! The restaurant is comfortable, inviting, nice and clean. The staff has always been friendly and it's never been crowded when we've gone. Prices are a tad on the pricier side considering there are a few other restaurants down the street, but this is my first choice."}
{"text":"Going to Mariscos Playa Hermosa is like taking a quick vacation to Rocky Point. The seafood was fresh, the service friendly and the atmosphere authentic. I went with the advice of a previous yelper and ordered the molcajete. And she was right, it truly was a volcano of food. Chicken, steak, fish and shrimp all surrounding a bubbling green sauce that's so good you want to drink it. Beans, rice, salads and fresh tortillas were served on the side, perfect for making your own little burritos. The complimentary ceviche tostadas were a nice touch and the green salsa was BUENO. The margaritas were really good too, although they were pretty small. All in all, it was well worth the drive and I can't wait to go back.   Note to late diners: they close at 8:00 :("}
{"text":"We have been to Playa Hermosa two times this week and have been completely impressed with both food and service! Ask for either Carla or Brenda for an authentic experience!! We will definitely be back for more. Bad to the bone!!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican seafood restaurant available, the aguachile is crazy good, molcajete dish is awesome, overall. Everything's great!"}
{"text":"This place was good, just not as good as I had hoped based on the reviews.  I would have given the place 3 1/2.  Since I can't, I decided to balance out another reviewer who gave the place 4 stars but also thought it deserved 3 1/2.  Positive notes:  Hot sauce had some bite to it, chips were good, Camarones culichi had a wonderful sauce.  Lots of fresh limes served with the meal.  Full bar.  Not-so-positive notes:  Shrimp in the Camarones culichi was overcooked (cardinal sin for a seafood place).  The shrimp coctail was just ok - good sized boiled shrimp, but not too much flavor.    If driving by and hungry I would stop in again, but not if I have to drive too far out of the way."}
{"text":"LOCATION:  This restaurant is indeed in a part of Phoenix  (south of I-10) known to be a \"bad\" neighborhood.  This is no easy badge to earn, because, unlike most other cities, there aren't good neighborhood separated from bad ones:  Phoenix is one of the few cities I've ever been to, where you can have a million dollar home and two doors down from it is a crack house.  Bizarre, but true.  Having said that, I personally would not want to come here when the sun is down, but when we arrived at 6pm, it was quiet and I didn't feel uneasy about the surroundings.  PARKING LOT:  The entrance to the restaurant is off of Garfield and not 16th Street, which you'll be taking to get here.  This is important, because you'd think it would have an entrance to the parking lot from the main road; it doesn't.  The parking lot, like the restaurant, is small and they share it with a barber shop, which threatens to tow if you park in their spots.  Obviously, this is no problem after they close; but during business hours, I imagine it can be hard to find spots which \"belong\" to the restaurant.  THE RESTAURANT:  And, like the parking lot, the restaurant is small inside.  There aren't a lot of tables, so it wouldn't take much to fill up the place.  The decor is typical \"Mexican\":  lots of colors, nature motifs, sombreros, etc.  It may be jarring for some conservative Anglo types, but they more than likely wouldn't come here anyway.  The pinks, blues, greens, yellows and other colors so typical of the Mexican Pacific seem to blend nicely and don't seem garrish at all.  Now, as I said, the place is small.  So, for example, someone sitting at the table behind me actually had to pass next to my table to get to their seat.  Not a big deal and she politely excused herself twice.  This might be unacceptable in a 3 or 4 star restaurant or even something simply \"formal\".  But the atmosphere in this place is far from formal.  It's friendly, loud, noisy and familiar.  If you don't like people and if you're uptight about someone walking past you while you're eating, you won't like this place.  If you're there to enjoy the food, have a good time with friends, or don't mind a lively atmosphere, you'll do fine here.  That being said, I believe, I read somewhere that they have live Mariachi music on Fridays.  I'm not a fan of the genre, but even if I were, as small as that place is, I have a strong feeling it would be very LOUD while the music was being performed.  There are two TVs in the place, which, typical for this kind of venue, were playing soccer.  They were not loud and did not intrude on personal conversations.  The place also seems to have a full bar and a number of beer specials.  THE FOOD:  Being older and having to bring in my reading glasses, one of the things I very much appreciated about the menu was each item being listed in Spanish and English, with Spanish written in blue and English in yellow ink.  This made it much easier to separate the two and quickly see what was what.  I ordered a fish combo which was supposed to come with octopus and shrimp and with a creamy mushroom sauce.  It was not a \"combo\" in the sense that most Americans would be used to.  I expected there to be some fish filet, some shrimp and some octopus.  What came was a fish filet covered in mushroom sauce with some shrimp and very tiny pieces of octopus mixed in.  My companion had a less expensive fish filet with garlic sauce.  Outside of the different price and the cream sauce, they looked exactly the same.  Nevertheless, while this might sound negative, I was not at all disappointed with my plate.  My companion thought his fish greasy; I think it was the garlic sauce.  My fish was not at all greasy and tasted wonderful.  The food was served hot, but not so hot as to burn you.  The rice served with the fish was plain and nothing exciting; and yet, it complimented the fish perfectly.  The portions look huge and they are; but I didn't feel stuffed when I was done; just contented.  It was just the right amount of food.  I had oysters as an appetizer.  If you like oysters, they were good with the lime juice I squeezed on them.  If you don't, well, then it doesn't matter, does it?  The ceviche was okay; a lot of reviewers made a big deal about them in their reviews.  There was nothing bad about them; just nothing special.  Overall, we were both VERY happy with the food, the portion size, the temperature they were served at, and the taste ... and my partner usually complains about everything!  So this is a BIG endorsement!  THE SERVICE:  *sigh* ... Not everything can be perfect and this was the pebble amidst the pearls in the evening.  The service staff is friendly.  But the place is too small, has too many people  (on a Thursday night, no less ... can you imagine it on a Friday?!?); and not enough servers to be as attentive as they have to be.  Food and drinks were served promptly.  But when it came time to pay, I had to track them down."}
{"text":"While passing through Phoenix we had a wide-selection of restaurant options to choose from. So glad we picked Playa Hermosa! All I can say is: WOW!! Our food was delicious and SO incredibly fresh!! A surprise from a non-coastal region. I ordered the Seven Seas Soup and in addition to it being chocked-full of seafood, the broth was flavored to perfection! The ambiance was festive and nicely decorated, very clean, and the staff, friendly, attentive and professional. Great place - don't miss it if you are looking for an unusually nice, casual and very reasonably priced dining experience!"}
{"text":"This place was a little out of the way but not far from my hotel.  I arrived late on a Wednesday, and was the only one there.  But the place was clean and colorful, and I was cheerfully greeted.  Throughout, I was not rushed, even when they were closing at 8PM.  Based on some of the reviews on Yelp, I wanted to try it out.  The chips and salsa were very good, although I didn't care for a somewhat smoky flavor of the salsa roja.  The verde was much better!  I went with the camarones salad to start.  Really tasty, LOADS of shrimp (maybe they had to get rid of them), but for me a bit too many onions.  However, the mixture, topped with cilantro was very tasty. In addition to the chips, a big basket of crackers accompanied the dish.  The entree I selected was the camarones culichi.  It was very tasty, with the sauce light, but delicious.  The flour tortillas were fresh and warm.  The meal was accompanied but a Negra Modelo (in the bottle, but they had it on tap as well.)  All in all, it was a great experience.  I don't think I will be able to make it back on this trip (and don't really know if I will ever - it's a long way from Alaska) but highly recommend stopping by.  Don't let the neighborhood or outside appearances deceive..."}
{"text":"Very Mexican atmoshere, lots of tiles and decorations. Food was good, the waitresses were very nice. I normally not much for ceviche stuff, but the hot meals I enjoyed. Great salsa!"}
{"text":"Good music, good chips and salsa.... Staff was friendly but  food took a lonng time to come out. I had to take it to go."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Nice setting. Good service. Especially like the fish tacos, and Crab Tostada."}
{"text":"This restaurant is decorated super cute, a little crowed but looks very clean!! As soon as I walked in I was helped. Everyone working was very kind to me. I ordered shrimp cocktail and it was delicious I definitely recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"The service is awesome, the food was out fast, and best of all everything we had was delicious. I definitely recommend the 7 mares caldo and their Micheladas, so delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious!  We had margaritas, fish ceviche, fish tacos and crab enchiladas. I would prefer the shrimp, but my grandpa was having shrimp so wanted fish. The verde sauce with the chips is really flavorful.   Fish tacos were great, packed with fish and so were the enchiladas (but with crab meat). The red sauce was a little on the sweet side. Paired with some of their many hot sauces, it was perfect. Large potions and good prices.   We made reservations for 6 on a Saturday and it was picked when we arrived but cleared up shortly after. I love the bright colors and there's a patio.   The service was excellent, staff working together and very friendly. I used the Yelp free cake offer and had the chocolate cake. Really good, giant piece.   If I've ever in town again, I'll come back. May have made a regular of my grandpa!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing. Ceviche tostada was awesome as will as the shrimp tacos.  Even the rice and salads on the plates were really appetizing. Hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican Seafood I have ever had.  And, I must add that I live in Los Angeles area and we have tons of Mexican Seafood Places, but this place is by far the best!!!!  They also have a very friendly staff as well... I travel to Phoenix all the time for business and I'm not having another trip w/o eating here.."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Clean and colorful, with excellent service, and the place was full on a Labor Day afternoon.   We had the shrimp with the green sauce and fish tacos.  Super tasty.  Ice cold Negro Modela on tap, 24 oz for $5 is unbeatable!   Wish the bar area was bigger but overall this place rocks."}
{"text":"All the Mexican seafood favorites - shrimp cocktail, ceviche, fish tacos, etc... The shrimp in hot red sauce are fantastic! All around good stuff. Good selection of Mexican beers as well. I went for the 24 ounce Modelo. Reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"The ceviche is the best I've tried in phoenix. Draft Mexican beer selection is great. Fair pricing on drinks and food. Have not tried anything here that's disappointed."}
{"text":"We are visiting from SF.  This was one of the best Mexican food we ever had. Chicken fajita and grilled fish was the best along with fish ceviche. Margarita are amazing."}
{"text":"This relatively small 12-table restaurant packs a nice mexican punch. The decor is a mexican coastal theme with a small bar and impressive wine selection. They have around 5 draft beers of standard mexican brews (Tecate, Dos, Corona, etc.).  To start the meal I ordered a $4.00 24 oz draft and the waitress brought out complementary (homemade) chips with two types of tasty salsa. A gratis talapia ceviche tostata (also pictured) followed, which was impressive.  I had an excellent shredded beef taco and carne asada enchaladas with red sauce (photo posted). The carne had a great grilled flavor that came through the bold taste of the red sauce. The salad was fresh and the rice contained lima beans, carrots, peas and corn - not your uninspired rice you typically get.   My waitress was helpful and attentive, the remaining staff was busy cleaning and organizing - a sign of a well run business. The deserts looked great (coconut cake, a chocolate cake and a stawberry merange pie looking thing) but was too full to partake.   It's close to the airport so I hit this after my business trip. Same experience! I'll return here when in Phonix again."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, this is the best mariscos in Phoenix! They were very accommodating to my shrimp allergy and assured that dishes I ordered would be made without. Service was prompt, friendly and attentive. We ordered oysters preparado, ceviche, seafood cocktail and al pastor. All were divine! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This was my second time in today and both visits have been excellent. I had the camarones culichi, and it was the most delicious thing in the entire world! Service was excellent as well. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Most of the menu specializes in seafood and it's great. I highly recommend this restaurant!! I frequent this place every time I'm in Phoenix at least once. Last visit I made it back a second time in one week. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Don't let the location turn you off. Just go in and enjoy. Oh yeah - 22 oz. beers on tap."}
{"text":"Micheladas are on point! Hospitality is amazing, the people are very friendly and very attentive to your needs. If I ever find myself in Phoenix I would definitely come eat here again."}
{"text":"Heading to this restaurant in downtown Phoenix from far north Scottsdale was definitely worth the trip! This is one of the best, authentic Mexican restaurants we've eaten at in the Valley. The place is small but they do take reservations and it's noisy. The atmosphere brings you back to a vacation in Mexico. The menu is mostly fish with lots of choices to choose from. Everything smells great and is very favorable with reasonable pricing. My brother and I shared the Molcajete Caliente which was so tasty and not spicy, I don't do spicy. They give you their homemade tortilla chips with a red and green salsa the green is the mild but to me that was spicy! My mom had the shrimp with caramelized onions and peppers basically a shrimp fajita, which she thoroughly enjoyed, Everything is fresh and handmade even the corn and flour tortillas. We were given a complimentary dessert by checking in on Yelp and we shared the Chocolate layer cake which was rich and decadent. The only disappointment was the Margaritas, we have had better. Great service and on Fridays they have Mariachis. We will certainly return again."}
{"text":"This place is a must try!! The Best service and Best Mariscos in town! We just relocated to AZ from South San Diego and its hard to find a decent place for mexican food/mariscos and we got lucky to find this awesome place. Ingrid is the best waitress but everyone is friendly and knowledgeable. Whatever dish or drink you order I'm sure you won't be disappointed as its all so amazing!"}
{"text":"Service food drinks ambiance ! If you're looking for a seafood place in the area you have to stop here ! I'm super picky with my food and this place exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"The best meal (camarones veracruzanos) I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant. And I've had plenty. Also the camarones diablos were devilishly spicy. Great sauces, salsas, guacamole, and margaritas.  Highly recommend. Great service too."}
{"text":"Man this place is so good. The food is fresh and tasty. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious change in Mexican food. Fantastic service followed by a great vibe for a seafood restaurant unlike others that make you feel uncomfortable. Make your way!"}
{"text":"Were here now.  Wife ordered the fryed fish.. I ordered the fried shrimp plate. There's a couple next to us,I guess on there lunch break. The lady next to me is losing it.   Lol  As soon as she left.. Her date.  Is like. Plz.   Just shut up!!!! Lol.  The food is good.  But still the best tasting Mariscos in phx.  Is still Mariscos Sinaloa off bell on cave creek.. Across McDonalds."}
{"text":"Was back again on business trip to Phoenix. Disappointed on reservation/wait time.  Ordered same entree as before ...not as good.  Disappointed"}
{"text":"Very good food, great service--the staff was extremely attentive and polite. All of the other customers were Latino, mostly families and couples, which speaks to authenticity of the food. The location is a bit out of the way but worth going to if you are looking for good Mexican food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited MPH last night after reading some great reviews on Yelp. This place did not disappoint.  The decor inside MPH is colorful and welcoming. Nothing to special, but nice. We were sat immediately and our drink orders taken. The reviews of the chips and salsa have not been exaggerated. The chips are thicker, almost softer and deliciously warm and salty. The red salsa has a nice rich, spicy flavor, but the green salsa, oh, the green salsa. The green salsa is avocado and cilantro based. It has a wonderful fresh, almost tangy flavor that is complimented well by the creaminess the avocado brings to the dish. When our drinks arrived my husband was delighted by the icy mexican coca-cola, as was I. Our waiter also brought out a fish ceviche tostada. Though it was a surprising treat the ceviche was not a flavorful as we had hoped.   While we enjoyed the chips and salsa we could hear and smell our entree being freshly prepared. With out waiter suggestion we ordered the Molcajete. Which is essentially a sampler of grilled sea bass, shrimp, chicken, beef and octopus all swimming and sizzling in a tasty tomatillo based sauce. All the meats were fresh, tender and very flavorful. The rich green sauce was delightful. The bubbling cauldron of flavor was accompanied by flour tortillas that were tasty, but most importantly had a great texture for sopping up all the sauce, yum. Also included were some decent creamy pinto beans and fluffly white rice with what seemed to be veg-all mixed in. Mu husband loved the rice, I was less impressed and opted to fill up on everything else.  I can not leave this review with out mentioning the amazing guacamole. Freshly made, and the perfect amount of chunkiness. Some of the best gauc I have had recently.   Our bill was an even 40 after tax and tip and we left with some delicious left overs.   Overall this place is great, delicious, fresh, and affordable with very friendly service."}
{"text":"Mariscos Playa Hermosa, or I like to call MPH, hands down the best authentic Mexican seafood restaurant in the Valley!  I have written couple of reviews on this place and every time I come here, I walk away extremely happy!  It really doesn't get better than this.  They recently remodeled their restaurant, they now have more seating, re-did the bathrooms, and they now include a full bar!  This place is awesome!  Ambiance-  Once you walk into this restaurant you are taken away by the bright colors, vibrant atmosphere and the great smelling food!  You will notice how clean the place is and how friendly the staff is.  This place is a family owned restaurant and the owners are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet.  Jose and Maria are wonderful people and will always welcome you.  Food-  This is what it's all about right?  The food is the main attraction and they have some of the most delicious food I've ever tasted.  I am a huge fan of seafood and this place has some of the best!  I have sampled many dishes here, but what has me always coming back is the fresh oysters, fried fish, ceviche, and their amazing sauces that they make.   Give this place a try if come to Phoenix, cause trust me, this is where all the locals go to eat.  Hands down, one of the best establishments I've been to!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!  Please don't let the surrounding area deter you from this fine establishment!   Staff: unbelievably friendly from beginning to end! Hector, our waiter, was patient throughout the many questions we had and even have us a complimentary ceviche dish to start!   Food: O.M.G! In order of our favorites: 1) molcajete. GET THIS!!! It is basically a volcano of saucy lava that is erupting with steak, chicken, shrimp, and fish. It is served with rice, beans, and tortillas and is made for two or three people to share. It is made in either a green tomatillo (mild) sauce or a red diablo (spicy) sauce. I liked the diablo more bc it had such amazing flavor.  2) guacamole: best ive ever had!! 3) Shrimp in cream sauce: yummmm. Great flavor! 4) Shrimp and octopus in garlic sauce - also good 5) shrimp tacos - just okay. Would choose the above over these  Finally, don't forget to check in on yelp!! Show your waiter and you get a big free slice of cake!!"}
{"text":"Wait time was a bit long, but they do provide a menu and water when you are waiting for a table. Food was delicious, I just wished the Diablo Sauce was Spicy. Me and the fam enjoyed our time here and our food. Now whenever I'm in the mood for mariscos, this will most likely be the place I will visit!"}
{"text":"Why doesn't this restaurant come up when you search for Mexican Seafood or restaurants near Sky Harbor? Don't they pay Yelp enough graft? Anyway that's beside the point. Bottom line is this place is very clean and has very friendly service, but the food is boring and unimpressive.  Even the chips and salsa are lacking. Chips should be thin and crispy, but their chips appear baked and puffy!"}
{"text":"The food ambiance and customer service has always been great here! The food is always fresh and the flavors are amazing! I have tried different items on the menu and I have not been disappointed. Quality is something you will find here!"}
{"text":"Wow!! I'm so glad we decided to give this place a try while we're visiting. The ceviche was amazingly refreshing and flavorful, everyone loved their food. We got the Chile verde, ranchero steak, enchilada style burrito, and enchiladas.  Also, very friendly staff and good service. We'll likely come back again before we leave to try other new things, maybe even a margarita! :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot! I have lunch here a few days a week due to the short distance from my corporate job. The servers are just wonderful and are always eager to offer one of their specialties or new items. My favorite is any dish with shrimp. The prepared oysters are DELICIOUS, you can't stop eating them! I usually sit in the outdoor patio and enjoy the mexican music or anywhere in the colorful restaurant inside with a delicious margarita or a cold beer in their frozen mugs! My fave in Phoenix! Must try!"}
{"text":"If you live in Phoenix and you have never been to this place, shame on you.  You have been missing out.  My husband and I were in PHX for a short vacay and after standing in the Hertz rental car line for 40 freaking minutes, I told him we are not going to Chino Bandido but the closest Mexican restaurant we can find on Yelp with the highest ratings.  Lo' and behold, it was Mariscos Playa Hermosa!  Literally 2 miles from the airport and easy to find.    We are so glad that we were able to find the best Mexican food we've ever had while in PHX, but it was hard having this as our first meal of the trip.  Every meal after this was just not cutting it.  Therefore, we planned the last day of our trip around the fact that Mariscos Playa Hermosa closed at 8pm on Sundays.   You really can't go wrong with the menu.  The first time, I ordered Fish Enchiladas and my husband ordered the Garlic Fish platter.  Both were amazing.  Their complimentary ceviche tostada was also delicious, as well as their salsas.   The 2nd time we went, I ordered the Camarones Culichi and my husband ordered another fish dish w/ vegetables.  Both were amazing again.  However, if you go here I would highly recommend the Camarones Culichi.....just because it's not something you find  at any mexican restaurant.  It was so delicious that I licked the plate of sauce clean after eating all of the shrimp, and I don't care how uncouth that might have looked because you will probably end up doing the same.  (Now, if you cannot handle spicy foods, you may want to be very cautious.  Maybe order an Horchata drink to go with the meal, or a side of sour cream to buffer the spiciness.)  Anyway, I don't want to hype it up too much or you might be disappointed."}
{"text":"Word to the wise, do not sit at the bar area. You can tell they're not used to having people sit there. It was messy and cluttered when we got up there and the servers had to clear it all out when we got up there. They didn't know how to ring up our order, since I mentioned earlier that they really don't seem to get a lot of people sitting at the bar. But overall the food had good flavor. A little skimpy on the seafood though. I ordered a Cameron y pulpo tostada and it was rather tiny."}
{"text":"We have eaten at this restaurant for at least 15 years. We love the seafood dishes and the the Mexican specialties. We usually have the poblano Fish filet dish, it comes with tuna ceviche served on a crispy taco, the poblano fish is served with lettuce, rice and beans.. We have eaten a number of different dishes here, but this is our favorite. The food, the prices and service are terrific!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to get great seafood!  Restaurant and Food:  The restaurant is nice and cozy.  At max, there are maybe 15 tables in the entire joint.  However, don't let the size, location, and lack of flashy chain-like display fool you.  The menu has a wide array of choices from fish tacos to different styled fish plates.  I had a fish plate prepared with garlic and a lemon pepper seasoning (Pescado Ajo Mojo I think) as well as an horchata for my beverages.  The food was impeccable!  In my experience, coming across fresh seafood in Phoenix is hard.  The seafood was well prepared and fresh (no gamy-fishy taste).   Additionally, the menu has pictures of almost every dish so you can gauge your interest in a choice (Visual examples appeal to me).  Service:  Spot on along with the food!  As mentioned previously, the restaurant is not that big.  Our server was always on top of her game and frequently stopped in to check on us.    Atmosphere:  The restaurant has a bright decor that is very fun and fitting for the type of restaurant.  Not to sound cliche, but you will feel almost as if you are at mom's kitchen (I'm Hispanic and my parent's house has similar decor).    Overall, this place wowed me with the food and the service.  For the price and quality you will receive at Mariscos Playa Hermosa, I doubt you can find many places in the neighborhood that will compete with this place.  Try it and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of state and this is one of my favorite places to visit while I'm in Phoenix area. It's a great time for the whole family. The food and music make it a wonderful experience. Staff is very friendly and the food is wonderful."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. The balance of quality, quantity and cost is perfected. This particular Mariscos location is a great date spot. It is right off the freeway, and very close to Cityscape for a night out. The interior is very colorful. Every once in a while you can even catch a mariachi band playing some live music."}
{"text":"Warm and inviting atmosphere.Authentic food, best ceviché in phoenix hands down. Friendly staff, family owned restataunt that has earned my repeat business. Very pleasent experience. Thank you MPH!"}
{"text":"The best mariscos in Phoenix! Molcajete best dish to share!!"}
{"text":"Food was good. I loved the fried whole fish. Burrito left my daughter desiring more so she ate 1/2 my fish. Rice and beans cane out cold and they charged for every extra little thing we asked for. Example the Pico de Gallo. Nearly $5 really?!? For Arizona, we out of town era expected better flavors, food options etc than we'd find in Washington."}
{"text":"First time I came here I did not like it one bit! I decided to give it a second try and order something different, I'm glad I did! I ordered the molcajete caliente and I can't explain how good the green sauce was! Spicy but with flavor and the chicken was well cooked and seasoned! Service could be better though."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was in Arizona for the A's spring training and yelped local places and found this place.  It was delicious!!! It was truly the highlight of my trip!  You'd be crazy not to go and try it!!!"}
{"text":"A family member referred me to this spot and I was not disappointed.  The food is always great and so is the service.  Obviously, weekends will always be busy. So suggest going early."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  I moved to Phoenix from Tucson recently and have been looking for a high-quality Mariscos (Tucson has a ton of these restaurants).  The food was absolutely delicious.  My partner and I enjoyed the seafood soup as well as the abalone cocktail.  We also each had a michelada.  The food was exceptional and the micheladas were not as spicy as I've had, but I prefer them less spicy anyway.  I'm sure they would spice it up more if you asked for it.  The place is really cute too--super funky tables and chairs and lots of color.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"2nd visit.  1st visit had seafood soup.  A bit heavy on cilantro for me, not a cilantro fan.  2nd visit had fish and shrimp with poblano sauce.   Would have been 5 stars but the only 4 shrimp came with it and they looked a bit lost on the large plate. Draft beer at $3 is a real bargain.  Service was helpful and quick.  HOW do they get the food out so quickly?  Place was nearly empty both nights. If this place was in a suburban strip mall, the line would be out the door.  Do yourself a favor and go.  I certainly plan on returning often."}
{"text":"This place is seafood heaven. Everything was DELICIOUS and flavorful. Right amount of heat with exceptional flavor and spice. They also gave us free seafood tostadas as an appetizer (in addition to chips and salsa). The prices were really reasonable too, which is sometimes a concern with seafood dishes. We are absolutely going back when our next seafood craving kicks in!!"}
{"text":"A hole-in-the-wall on Calle 16, best known for an entirely different class of south-of-the-border fare at Barrio Cafe, Mariscos Playa Hermosa does Mexican-style seafood better than anyone in the Valley. Each meal starts with not only the customary chips and salsa, but an outstanding complimentary ceviche tostada. Favorites include Seven Seas Soup, Camarones Culichi, and of course their ceviche, which comes in several varieties. Most dishes come with beans and rice, but these are not the typical refried pintos and tomato-heavy rice typical of Mexican restaurants. Lovers of scorch-your-mouth spices should try the guacamole, which is heavy on the jalapeno. Portions are huge and service is outstanding."}
{"text":"Just plain fantastic. About 70% of the menu is not your typical Mexican fare... Excellent seafood options. Tried the shrimp peppers and wrapped in bacon. It was pretty darned good, but will try other items when I come back because there are literally 12+ must try dishes in their menu. The michalades (spelling) drink with tomato sauce and beer was super fantastic. Way better than a Bloody Mary and I love Bloody Mary's!!!"}
{"text":"Nice authentic Mexican joint. I don't remember the name of what I ordered but it was basically a bucket of meat and spicy sauce. It was excellent."}
{"text":"I only had the mixed seafood cocktail. It was not as cold as I expected it to be. The temperature and watered down flavor made me cautious about eating it. Not the best I've had. The michelada was amazing and my husbands carne asada tacos were flavorful. I would go back and try something different."}
{"text":"Best Mexican I've ever had!, fast, friendly service and the decor is very colourful and fun! Highly recommend trying!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Everything here is amazing. The food, the service, the atmosphere, the prices.   The food tastes SO fresh. The seafood, the veggies, all of it. It is so great. And if you like spicy foods, try the Diablo sauce.... boy, is it hot (but tasty).   The service really is unbelievably amazing. We had a couple of questions that our sever couldn't answer so she grabbed someone who could. They were also great about working with my wheat allergy (they definitely have a number of gluten free options).  I had the jalapeño margarita and sucked it down so quick I was actually amazed how good it was. I could barely taste the alcohol for a few minutes then quickly realized that it was, in fact, kind of potent... it had great flavor and a little bit of a kick (nothing too bad). We also got a Cadillac margarita, which was also tasty.   Our bill ended up being about $100 for three people (with six drinks). You can't beat that price anywhere.   Come here if you like great food, drinks and prices."}
{"text":"This was the most authentic Mexican Restaurant I have been in outside of Mexico.  The Guacamole was out of this world!  I sat at the bar and the bartender (Bella) recommended a \"Mexican Mule\" made with Ginger beer and Tequila which really went well with the Shrimp dish (Camarones Rancheros) that I ordered.  I liked it so much that I am going back tonight for more.  They even had a real Mariachi band that was awesome!  Don't be surprised by the meager look from the outside of this place!  It is truly remarkable."}
{"text":"I have been here three times and each time I have not been disappointed! The ceviche here is De-LOY-coius! Great place to eat in this hot Arizona summer weather! Also, the Micheladas they make here are by far the best in this state! Great atmosphere, the only downside is the parking, they have extra parking across the street, but that doesn't bother me, the food here well makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican. The best I've had in years. Great selection of Mexican beers and some unique liquor concoctions...check out the michelada...a spicy bloody Mary with a bottle of dos xx upside down on top.   Did I mention the food is INCREDIBLE!!!"}
{"text":"Pescado a la planca is excellent!! We were a party of 10 when my parents were in town and the food was excellent. Unfortunately they confused some of the order and wouldn't fix it, which put a slight dent in my opinion of their customer service.  Love the place."}
{"text":"Okay, so first I have to mention the decor is so nice it took me back to Mexico!  It goes downhill from here. We waited an hour for our meal of fish tacos and shrimp cocktail. In their defense, they did have a large group in the back. However, when we finally received our food, my hubby's tacos were steaming hot and his beans and rice were barely warm. Also, my shrimp was a tiny bit fishy tasting which was very surprising for a place that specializes in seafood!  Overall, not bad but a disappointment."}
{"text":"Raised in Arizona, I have spent the last 13 years in Michigan, where salsa often consists of ketchup with cut tomato in it. I craved fresh chips and salsa, and I am in heaven. I ordered the Cameron Ranchero, and it was excellent. A great place to get reacquainted with good Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Food was good,Oysters were small and a little understaffed when we went this past January (2014). The restaurant is not in the best part of town but has a lovely ambiance, I would definitely go back and try some of their other dishes!"}
{"text":"I have finally made it down to Mariscos Playa Hermosa.  The restaurant is a tiny building on the SE corner of 16th St and Garfield.  Just south of a ran down liquor store.  The parking lot is very small so be prepared to park on the street.  The inside is colorful but smelled very strongly of bleach.    The waitress took our drink order but never came back.  Another girl came out to take our food order and asked if we wanted drinks.  We let her know that the other girl already took them and then she came back to ask us again what we wanted.  Shotty service from the jump and a knockout of bleach to the nose wasn't a very good start for me.  We ordered a medium shrimp cocktail, shrimp ceviche, and camarones culichi to share.  Our drinks made it out with some chips and green and red salsa.  Both salsas were plain and non noteworthy.  The other food came out next.  The culichi had a zesty green sauce that was a blend of tomatillos, cilantro, and spices.  Very tasty and went pretty well with the shrimp and even better poured on the rice and beans.  The ceviche was also tasty.  Lots of tiny pieces of shrimp with a nice lime flavor and pico de gallo mixed together.  The shrimp cocktail was boring uninspired and didn't belong on the same table as the other two dishes.  The green culichi sauce was unique and creative and the ceviche was on point.  The shrimp cocktail and rest of the experience fell flat.  The service wasn't great (forgot drinks, no refill offered), the price was ok (13.99 for 8 shrimp in a tomatillo sauce is about right), and the ambiance was weakened withe the smell (no cleaning solvent should overpower the smell of your cuisine)."}
{"text":"5 stars for food!  but minus 2 stars for the unnecessary note on the check.. booooo  Came here w/ my inlaws and their friends. Total 5 people.  I'm in my 30s and the other folks in their 60s retired.  I did most of the ordering and talking w/ the server and I handed the card to the server even before I got the check to show the staff that I am taking care of the bill.  However, once I got the final bill for about $160 (which was fine by me), written In big words and highlighted, they wrote:  TIP IS NOT INCLUDED - and highlighted the suggested amounts.  I find this rather offensive to write this.  I am already picking up the tab for the entire party and it was not necessary to write that on the check.  I always tip at least 20% even as high as 35%.  Nevertheless, I still tipped a little over 20%, but why they needed to highlight tip is not included is beyond me.  Maybe its because we are asian and my group consisted of seniors - but I hate to throw the race card in this review.. Oh wait.. I just did! haha!  Food is great and even the server was great  but this note on bill ruined the experience.    I just hope this does not happen to any other diner... I care about the people!"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST Mexican Seafood I've had in a really long time! We come to Phoenix often, I guarantee we'll be back.   Oyster appetizer was delicious -- very fresh and clean. Had two micheladas and to be honest I usually don't order micheladas as I don't like them. I tried my husbands and I was impressed.   We shared a mocajete that was more than enough for the both us. It has beef, chicken, shrimp, and oysters inside, as well as fish. Also ordered the \"Toritos\" which are jalapeños (not regular jalapeños, not sure what it was) stuffed with shrimp and wrapped in bacon. Cooked to perfection!!  For dessert: the flan -- this wasn't my favorite but it was still good."}
{"text":"In my never ending quest to find the best mexican food in the universe I came across this lovely little colorful gem in central Phoenix. Warning, the color scheme in this place may cause seizures, minor heart explosions, massive weight gain, restless torso syndrome and restless leg syndrome. First off you know you're in the right place where you wonder if you're car is safe to park there. You walk in and a complete array of colors hit you, leaving you breathless, speechless and eventually i'm sure sightless. The food and margeritas were amazing. Shrimp Cerviche was to die for. It was delicious and I have to honestly say that although my quest to find the best mexican food in the universe will never be complete, this is my favorite place for shrimp Cerviche so far."}
{"text":"You scare me, but I like it!!! Scary delicious that is!   So it doesn't matter what cartel you roll with, this place kicks ass all around. So leave your chrome 45 Outside and enjoy a nice meal here with family and friends. I had some out of town peeps that may have been from Michoacán, maybe Sinaloa, maybe Nayarit. The important thing is that the chuamanta place on McDowell and 36th street was abandoned and we had no Plan B. A quick look at yelp in the surrounding area revealed this little gem of a place. It was Saturday at 10:00 am and they opened about 15 mins late. It was tote worth it !! The service was friendly. The place was decorated in a charming colorful way and food was really good. This place came highly rated and I trusted and was not disappointed. Hear me know and believe me later after you scarf! Cheap this place is not. You want cheap seafood go get a Mc Fish which during Lent. Lunch for me and my compadres set me back @ $70 with a couple of beers. Great experience. They brought out some botanas on the House little tostadas with fish. They had a black sauce akin to hoisin sauce that was sooo good. La Negra brand on the table. Anyway I don't roll in the hood often but when I do this place is a 10.   Muy sabroso !! Buenisimo !   Also don't fall for a scam involving bus fare with a lady and some kid that looks like he's 12 cruising the parking lot. Save your money for beers inside!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place.  Excellent Mexican seafood and superb service.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Molcajete WHOA. This place is really fun and delicious! It does get pretty loud when the mariachi band comes in on Friday nights, so beware. The décor is bright and vibrant, and I'd say the usual vibe of the restaurant matches how it looks. This restaurant is so good that it draws a diverse crowd.   I've been here a few times and can never get away from the molcajete. I've tried both the red and the green and I think I prefer the red, although both are absolutely delicious. It's definitely enough to share unless your dining companion is a troll. The molcajete is served with chicken, beef (carne asada), and fish. There is usually some seafood swimming around in the molcajete \"stew\" as well. It comes with tortillas on the side and you can make delicious fish/chicken/beef/molcajete tacos!   The area of town is a bit sketchy. I've been approached by homeless people for cash when I'm leaving the restaurant. I'm not put off by that but I know some people aren't into that."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Went in today for the first time. Ordered way too much food, and ate it all! Loved everything: Ceviche--crisp, fresh, delicious; stuffed peppers with shrimp--incredible; and for my entree I got the divorced fish--SO GOOD! Really great find that I'm thankful for.   I'll be back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I have never taken the time to write a review until now. I consider myself a strong critic of Mexican food, because I'm from California, and have eaten at many authentic \"hole in the walls\" This place is truly a hidden gem!  My family and I had several dishes including the whole red snapper, shrimp culuchi I and carne asada all where excellent.  This will surely be a stop of mine every time I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"The margarita was delicious, the complimentary ceviche top shelf, the camarones (shrimp) culichi was rich and almost creamy, so good I could not stop sopping it up with the tortillas until it was gone.  The sauce is complex, but I am unable to break it down by ingredients. I will take this oportunity to bash Pete's Fish and Chips once again.  You could not get any further from Pete's than by visiting Playa.  Playa Hermosa is not kidding when they claim to bring the ocean to the desert.  I had several fat shrimp that had been \"cooked\" in lemon juice.  They sat there on  cucumber slices, glossy gray and white, splayed open and bathing in the juice with wedges of avocado. They were so fresh, they looked like they had just been hauled up and dumped on the deck.  This is a mouthful of ocean, there is no mistaking that you are eating seafood!  Food like this touches parts of your brain in a powerful way.  If you were not reared on fresh seafood and the thought of sashimi makes you queasy, then I suggest you not jump in with both feet, maybe work your way up with small portions of ceviche.  The service was very attentive and professional, the feel is genuinely festive. Though Playa Hermosa is a family oriented restaurant I have never noticed any children acting out.  I've found this to be the case generally downtown, the children are well behaved in public, whereas in Chandler, Scottsdale and Mesa I have witnessed children in restaurants behaving more like pro wrestlers than diners.  I live about a mile and a half from Playa and I keep asking myself why I'm not down there more often."}
{"text":"I had quite high expectations for our meal here this weekend and to be honest, I wasn't blown away.  After further consideration, I think I perhaps ordered something that just wasn't for me.    Things that bothered me:    My house margarita was blue.  The drink menu said it had tequila and lime.  What was in there that was blue?    My shrimp had the digestive tract intact which is a turnoff for me.  The Garlic Shrimp (which I see from other reviews is very popular) just didn't work for me.  It was essentially peppers, onions and shrimp in a literal bowl of garlic butter.    Things I liked:    The chips and salsa were excellent as were the tortillas.    Loved the complimentary ceviche tostada.    The coconut cake was out of this world."}
{"text":"Not sure why the high star reviews. We went here with high hopes of a shining review. Instead I got bait and switched.  Chips were thick corn and the salsa was water but the guacamole sauce was pretty good. The 'drowning shrimp' was a nice start and I thought the rest of the meal would follow suit.  I thought I was playing it safe with garlic shrimp, but I was surprised that for $15 you get six medium (seriously the 25-40 size) shrimp. The 7 seas soup was watery with little to it...the main reason we drove 30 minutes to the ghetto...think Notorious BIG \"Juicy\" playing in the background as you roll up.  Homeless drunk lady harassing patrons as they waited for tables and the guy I told about it seemed to care less.  The mariachi band was a nice authentic touch and was fun, but a bit intense for such a small place.    Don't get me wrong. It's a good mariscos restaurant and if you are in the area it's probably the best mexican seafood option for more than a few blocks.  My apologies for some reason my phone only saved the pic of the 'drowning shrimp' (raw shrimp over cucumber and tomato drizzled with lemon juice,salt,pepper and topped with avocado and onion ---like whole shrimp ceviche.)"}
{"text":"Great small and authentic place!  Yeah, as others have said, maybe not the \"best\" neighborhood, but we had no issues.  The place is small, so plan to wait if you come in the busy time.  QUALITY food for sure and mainly seafood based but thankfully for me they have non-seafood items for folks like me who don't care for seafood. Everyone at the table loved what we got and would certainly come back again!"}
{"text":"The House Specialty is absolutely amazing. Don't let the spice keep you from ordering it! This spice is super favorable, with the perfect amount of hotness! It is served piping hot and along with a side of rice, beans and tortillas, which helps with the toning down of the spice.   We come here just for this dish, not that the thought hasn't crossed our minds of changing it up, we just keep coming back to the malcajete caliente! This Diablo sauce is addicting.   The service is always great, staff is friendly and love the Mexican music, really puts the authenticity to the whole experience!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great flavorful Mexican Seafood meal this is the place. We had the El Capitan - lots of flavors. My favorite was the culichi shrimp in the tomatillos."}
{"text":"Once again, I followed the yelp reviews and wasn't disappointed. The complementary chips were light and crisp. I don't know what the creamy, green salsa was, but it was so good I ate til I finished it!  I ordered the camarones (shrimp) with the tomatillo and cilantro sauce. It was so rich and flavorful with just a hint of heat. The sides were delicious, but I only had room to sample them. Thanks to Yelp, I got a free piece of flan which was so good that I ordered another to go for my flan-loving child.  I'm only in Phoenix for 5 more days, but I think I will be back..."}
{"text":"Definately my kind of place- Diamond in the rough... Fresh seafood... and cheap beer! The food was delicious! I can't wait to go back and try that giant seafood pot!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food and great service. The green salsa is terrific with fresh chips. I usually get one of three things: filete a la plancha (grilled fish), tacos al gobernador (shrimp tacos) or the fish ceviche. The shrimp cocktail and shrimp culiche (baked in green sauce with cheese) are also amazing. I've been coming to this place for years, and the quality is always outstanding.  I'm just a bit surprised that it isn't more crowded--with food this good, you'd think people would be flocking here!"}
{"text":"Very nice place.... inside makes you feel at ease and the colorful tables and chairs make it great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I moved to the valley a few years back and I looked up seafood online.  Well it took me about 2 years to get here, but it was well worth the trip.  I now make excuses to get near this place.  I have been more than a half dozen times with different people and we always leave satisfied.  I probably shouldn't give them 5 stars as I don't want the parking lot to be completely full when I get there."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp, I was craving some mariscos close to the hospital where I was visiting. I really wanted to love this place because unlike other Mexican mom and pops restaurants they had excellent service. We were greeted and seated quickly, the waitress quickly took our drink order and brought them right out. After she took the food order we were given complimentary tostadas de ceviche. As for the food the chips and salsa were on point. But the beans and rice were terrible. The camarones culiche were not spicey at all and just lacked flavor. I'll go back for drinks but not food."}
{"text":"We had a party of nine everyone order was done right . I order the whole red snapper fried it was very good . The carrot cake was good . Just needs more selection of teas and punches . I was also looking for the menudos soup , they didn't care it they carry seafood soup I get that at home ."}
{"text":"Great place for Mariscos! May be the best I've had yet. You sometimes get a free ceviche tostada. I still haven't figured out what triggers this.  If anyone else knows, please fill me in."}
{"text":"Amazing food, the place is beautiful and colorful. Workers doing a good job always checking up on you. Not a big fan of sea food but now I'm liking it :)  Will return!!"}
{"text":"Three trips has not disappointed yet.  the interior atmosphere is spot on to a number of places I have been to in Central America.  The decor, the service, the atmosphere.  I have had very attentive waitresses each time.    The chips and salsas are very nice(ok one humid weekend I thought the chips were a bit stale).  One dip is a darker red salsa (smoked chillis?)  the second one is my favorite it is green cilantro and avocado dip.  It is so good I have purchased some to take home for later (ask the waitress - even comes iwth chips).  The first two times I ordered a whole fried fish ajillo, covered in sauteed garlic, peppers and onions.  It was very authentic just as I had eaten many times down south.  The rice and beans are as expected, not fantastic not dry and tasteless like other places.  Note - I did not come for rice and beans ;-).  Once my wife ordered the Camarones Culichi Shrimps In A Green Sauce, Tomatill & Cilantro, which was excellent.  The waitress recommended it and she was right.  The sauce seems to have some cheese mixed/melted in that made it sinfully savory.  Another time I ordered tacos al pastor.  OK, I know it is a seafood shop but after the nice ceviche I was ready for some flesh.  The tacos were very good. I liked how their al pastor was crispier than some.  Maybe a personal preference, but they were good.  Key note for me - they offer a variety of margaritas.  I prefer the upcharged one where they mix it themselve, not the premix bottled one. (they sell both)  for me it is less sweet and has a cleaner appeal.    I am planning on going back again next week when more family come to visit.  Last note:  The neighborhood is not the greatest.  I come from a tougher city so it was no big deal to me, but some others might appreciate being warned."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem.. Scary Exterior (especially IF you aren't from the area). So we found this place on Yelp.. drove around a few times and then when we found it, we couldn't believe this place was actually where we were thinking about having dinner. The area is less than inviting and at night it feels destitute.  We decide to take a chance and the interior is warm and bright. Patrons are enjoying themselves and we are greeted with big smiles by the waitress.  We were seated and served this pretty tasty ceviche tosta on the house. We also ordered a separate order of ceviche, that wasn't as good and took forever to come out. But skipping on to the entrees, people were pleasantly surprised.. ranging from my vegan co-worker to my meat head only co-worker. I had the fish in red sauce with rice and beans which was awesome. My vegan friend had the enchiladas with green sauce which was also tasty. I did hear the drinks were not that tasty.. so be wary of the margaritas.  Good food, reasonable price. I'd give it a 2nd go."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend of mine as we wanted to try some Mexican seafood and this restaurant is supposedly one of the best options in Phoenix. I haven't been here before they remodeled the interior to fit more seating but it definitely looks really nice now and very colorful inside.  We decided on getting the Shrimp Cocktail and the Molcajete for two people. The Shrimp Cocktail was very tasty and everything we had hoped for. As for the Molcajete we were a bit disappointed that there was quite a bit of chicken and steak since we had hoped for more seafood. The sauce used was a \"Diabla\" sauce which was really good and surprisingly not as spicy as I had anticipated. I'm glad that we tried their house specialty but would probably pass on it next time that we come here.  Service was friendly and prompt. Overall this is a great place if you're looking for Mexican style seafood!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my AZ family. I'm from San Diego and know what really good Mexican food is. This place was amazing! I had these delicious shrimp stuffed, bacon wrapped yellow peppers!"}
{"text":"Not sure why so many people wrote that this is in a sketchy neighborhood unless they have never been outside of the suburbs. Just because a neighborhood is not all white does not mean it's bad. This great place is on a main road across from a church and near a senior apartment complex and a hospital. Seriously folks. Let's not be so judgy.    Also, it is not crappy from the outside. In fact it is brightly painted, inviting, and has a patio with lights strung over it. Inside is decorated just as beautifully, with colorful paintings, lush greenery, and cozy tables. We happened to stop by on a Friday night and were entertained by a mariachi band. It did mean that it was a little loud at times, but everyone in the restaurant seemed to be having a great time. It was family oriented--several groups with kids--as well as couples on date nights.   The food was excellent. Shrimp ceviche -- incredible. The waitress recommended molcajete caliente (cheesy hotpot with fish, shrimp, chicken, carne asada, and octopus). It came with beans, rice, tortillas, and a little salad. Yum yum. Chips were a little greasier than we would like but were free and came with two good salsas. If we lived in Phoenix, we would be regulars!"}
{"text":"Good, tasty. Kind people. Good seafood. Plenty of chips. Salsa is pretty decent, lacks kick though."}
{"text":"I really hate having to write this because I really was hoping that I was going to have this delicious mouth watering experience after reading the reviews.     Unfortunately this was not the case, as I stepped into the restaurant the decor was something I pictured a Mariscos restaurant would look so colorful and beautiful and my server was friendly and that is were it ends.    I ordered a water of jamica w/o ice as I took a sip to my disappointment it was warm. Now I ask myself shouldn't fresh fruit water drinks be placed in ice or the refrigerator to avoid contamination? So for my meal I had the shrimp ceviche plate and as I took a bite of my tostada all I could taste is the staleness of the tostada and saltiness of the civiche and I am one who LOVES salt. The shrimp definitely was not fresh (I wonder if it may have been canned?). So I brought it to the waitress attention that the saltine crackers and tostadas were stale. She informed me that the restaurant was aware of this. Now why would a 4 1/2 star restaurant serve stale food to their customers?    Mariscos Playa Hermosa I wish I could say my food made my taste buds dance but it did not."}
{"text":"Not in a really good area but the food was just fantastic! We knew it would be when we walked in. Wouldn't mind coming here again before we fly home. I had the Chile verde and it was great! Move over Cholos Mexican restaurant.. this place has got you beat!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite place when it comes to seafood. I have tried many things on the menu but I have to say my all time favorite are the fish tacos! I have tried the aguachile and it is good I personally would of liked it more spicy and some more avocado which traditionally comes with. The micheladas are     Pretty darn good. If your up for trying something outside the box try the camarones culichi."}
{"text":"We loved the colorful decor all around, the walls, the tables, the chairs, the murals! Truly a great feast for the eyes. We had the Molcajete Caliente Estilo Playa Hermosa for two. Four different meats - beef, chicken, fish, shrimp. Small pieces of squid in the molcajete! It was so good and we were stuffed. All for $33. Great value. The service was friendly and attentive. We could banter with the waitress. Desserts looked very good, we had to take the carrot cake home (it had cream cheese filling, studded with pecans and flakes of coconut)!!"}
{"text":"My first International Supper Club! I think we overwhelmed the kitchen - everything was just a bit off.  Granted - it's not a huge restaurant - and I think having a group of 20 something people arrive and order at once would throw any small, independent restaurant off.   Service was as friendly as could be - but it is difficult for 2 servers to handle 20 hungry and thirsty patrons. Arrival of dinners was poorly spaced - by the time the last person got her plate, the first people were done. Sides and tortillas came very late. The food itself was somewhere between decent and good. I have no complaints, but wasn't really wowed by anything I tried.  I can see the diamond in the rough quality here - and I have friends that love it - so I will be back with just a small group (4 tops) to see what a \"normal\" dinner is like."}
{"text":"The house speciality (for three) seems to have practically everything in a hot stone bowl and comes with all of the accompaniments required to turn the contents into tacos (if desired). The complementary ceviche tostadas were appreciated. The mariachi band was... enthusiastic... and a bit loud. The restaurant is fun and may be the best source of Mexican seafood in the valley, but I was not blown away by any of the items I sampled. I'll probably return, but the restaurant does not elicit irresistible cravings."}
{"text":"Everything we had was amazing. The molcajete with shrimp, fish, chicken, and steak was the best I've had. Tried the flan and michelada and they were really good too. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite favorite place now!! Everything we've had has been great but our go to dish is the Molcajete Caliente and I will probably never steer away from it. The sauce? BOMB. The tortillas? BOMB. The octopus? BOMB."}
{"text":"Whenever a friend or out of towner asks me where they can find the best Mexican food in the valley, my answer is always the same.  The more questionable the neighborhood, the better.  That's by no means an exact science (nor meant to be demeaning to the neighborhoods for which many of these establishments undoubtedly take great pride).  But with apologies to the numerous suburban Mexican food establishments that dot the valley landscape, the working class Hispanic neighborhoods of inner city Phoenix are where I've always found the best Mexican grub.  When I told my Dad I wanted to try this place and where it was, he hesitated a bit thinking we were driving into a death trap.  Fortunately my food adventurist side convinced him to make the trip with me to try this place for the first time.  And oh, what a place.  I first found out about Maria Maldonado's creation on a segment of the wildly popular PBS show Check Please Arizona (you can watch it on YouTube right now).  From the onset, you could tell this wasn't your typical Mexican establishment.  While they have all the usual Mexican staples you'd expect (burritos, tacos, fajitas, etc.), the emphasis here is decidedly on seafood.  But even the meat dishes here are completely unique to the valley (more on that in a bit).  Thanks to the Check Please segment and the fabulous Yelp reviews, we came in the door on a Sunday afternoon.  As I expected (though to the shock of my Dad), the place is a rainbow of colors from the furniture, to the walls, to the numerous photos and keepsakes on the wall.  And yet its small enough that it feels like you've walked into someone's dining room.  We got here just before the dinner rush so we got sat immediately.  My Dad and I first got a couple of Dos Equis Lagers to start.  I mention this because the beers that came out were HUGE.  The beers came in cold gigantic beer mugs to where there was at least 2 bottles worth of beer in each mug.  Did not see that coming, but a GREAT start to the evening.  Next, we (unexpectedly) each got a complementary appetizer of ceviche on a tostada.  Basically a variety of different fishes (I think I picked up octopus, shrimp and tuna) mixed with guacamole and other veggies with a hint of lime juice.  Very refreshing dish.  Then they brought out the chips and salsas (one of which was a green salsa that had a big kick to it).  All of this food and drink before we even ordered our own dishes?  Wow.  My Dad got the grilled shrimp skewers that were seasoned and wrapped in bacon and cheese.  I went with the dish this place is most famous for.  A giant molten bowl of green tomatillo sauce and cheese with shrimp, fish, chicken, and beef lining the rim of the bowl (see my photo).  This my friends is the Molcajete Caliente (even the name sounds intimidating doesn't it?).  Both of our dishes came with a side of beans and rice (though even the rice was different as it was more of a rice pilaf).  While the tomatillo and cheese is bubbling hot (and pretty much stays that way), its actually not spicy at all.  But it coated every piece of meat on the bowl beautifully.  The meats were all grilled and seasoned perfectly and with a coat of that tomatillo and cheese I was in heaven.  My Dad absolutely destroyed his bacon and cheese shrimps he loved them so much.  I was going to use the Yelp check in for the free tres leches cake (which they do honor), but we were both so stuffed full of food and beer we couldn't eat another bite.  Between the great food, festive atmosphere, friendly waitress and stuffed stomaches, our first venture here was a highly successful one.  Total tab for the 2 huge beers, chips and salsa, complimentary ceviche tostadas, main dishes, sides, tax and tip was $75.  The Molcajete is $30 by itself so that's what pushed the price a little higher (they also have a bowl for larger groups that runs around $40).  But trust me, this is $30 worth spending.  It can easily feed two or more people (though I stupidity tried to take it down myself).  I'll happily enjoy the rest for lunch tomorrow.    So like I said, if you're craving good Mexican food, look towards the inner city area.  Even though i was pretty excited about this place, even I was surprised how generous the portions were and by all the freebees.  Its no wonder the place was packed the whole time we were there and why it seemed like every customer was smiling.  The Maldonados originally created this oasis in the desert to help pay for their kids' college education and achieve the American dream for their entire family.  If their cuisine, staff and happy customers are any indication, I'd say the hard work has paid off, many many times over."}
{"text":"The service was great, the food was just as good.  I just came in from Buffalo, NY and it's been awhile since I've had good Mexican food.  the carñe asada burrito nd ceiveche tostada hit the spot."}
{"text":"Lucky that I was on time for their mariachi.. I had their tocos and their combination seafood soup.. The tocos was amazing and their soup was just average, had it's better in New Mexico.. The  service nice and the restaurant has a good environment.."}
{"text":"The reviews are spot on.  My husband and I went to this place for an early dinner.  Yes, the area looks a little rough but it was pretty early.  I followed the recommendation of other yelpers and ordered the shrimp culichi, very good choice.  My husband had the Torito de camaron, a yellow chili filled with shrimp, even better choice than mine.  The salsas were so good, the tomatillo one had enough spice for me.  I can handle spice, the red one was great too, however a bit too spicy for me this week.  Maybe another time I might enjoy it more.  My husband loved it.  We also had the shrimp meatball soup, very well seasoned and delicious. BTW I loved their corn tortillas and they told me they get them at the Sonorense.  They were fresh and cooked to perfection.  I dipped them in the green salsa, YUM. The margaritas are ok, but I was really here for the food."}
{"text":"Went once with my GF and have been back 3 times since! I always get the whole fish plate its sooo good.  I really like the mincheladas also. mmmmm."}
{"text":"One of the better Mariscos places in Phoenix. Ceviche is very fresh and goes well with some cold beer."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge seafood fan, but I'm sure if you are - this is the place to go!  Their non-seafood fare is also amazing.  Their salsas are to die for - especially the green cilantro avocado.  And their beans are divine.  Great beef & chicken, & yummy veggies."}
{"text":"Service-5 Food-5 Decor-4 Atmosphere-4 Value-4   Food was wonderful service was great. There is nothing that I would change about my experience. I had the stuffed fished. (Shrimp and octopus) I forget the exact name but I will definitely be ordering it again. Their appetizer was wonderful. You can really taste the freshness in the ingredients. No complaints, even the house margaritas were some of the best I have ever had. Yelp had a check in offer for a free slice of cake. Our waitress was so sweet that since we weren't able to decided on coconut or chocolate she gave us a small slice of each. These cakes were moist and delightful. The thing that kept me from devouring the whole thing was fact I was pretty full from my app & main course. Will definitely be back. Will definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I ate here 2 years ago and had one of the best meals. Not sure what changed, oh wait, it's the quality of the fish. I got the caldo de pescados. The sea bass was gross. So then they brought me a sea bass with ancho chiles that looked good but again, the fish was no bueno. I'm real sorry. I drove 30 minutes out of the way to come here and had 2 inedible entrees.   Crab tostada, guacamole and margarita were ok but not worth the embarrassment of not eating 2 different dinners. The staff was super nice about it and the owner didn't charge me. I wanted to pay but he refused. So nice but I felt terrible. Bad dream."}
{"text":"Go there and get the bacon wrapped shrimp with cheese. To top the meal off get a michelada with Dos XX. Coming from a Mexican I can tell you this place is legit and can get swamped on a Friday. Good service and descent prices, it is mariscos after all. Now I want to go back and it's only been two days......"}
{"text":"Excellent tasting food, very close to airport.  We had trouble with a rental car that we did not take from the lot and then accidentally leaving something in it and we were on the phone for quite some time before we can place our order. The server was very understanding and did not bother us too much. He did bring chips and salsa and water right away which were consumed while on the phone trying to straighten out our missing item.  After taking our order he brought out a free ceviche tostada. It had great fresh, seafood flavor and the tostada was very crispy.  Bass & shrimp \"divorciados\" - that means that half of the dish is covered in a spicy red/orange colored sauce and the other half is covered in a very tasty green chili sauce. A lot of Mexican places also call this Christmas because of the red and green. It was too much food along with the really creamy refried beans and a slightly different version of Spanish rice in that it had a little bit of green beans, carrots and corn in it and the rice was white, not yellow. It was moist and went well as a base for the two sauces.   Calamares & shrimp al ajo - this was a large casserole full of sautéed calamari rings and shrimp swimming, literally, in white wine, olive oil and garlic. It was just too much sauce, although fresh and flavorful.  Corn tortillas however were too processed. They need more rustic looking and more tender corn tortillas. These look, felt and tasted like a major retail brand. Not good."}
{"text":"I've been sick on my little holiday, and while I have a tendency to eat my way through a new city with an unlimited budget, good old affordable mexican sounded just right for post nasal drip and sore throat.  *Be prepared for very, very loud music. *Not a ray of sun shines into this building.   *I wanted to sit in the garden during this summer \"cold spell\" of 70 degrees - but we were denied.  (Seriously the perfect temp for al fresco dining.) *Top shelf margaritas will run you $10. Is it just me or does that seem like a lot for a hole in the wall in AZ?  Yelpers seem to love this place; we liked it just fine.  We got one fish dish and the carne asada platter with cheese enchilada.  When in doubt, stick with the fish.  The meat was very average in quality and flavor.  The grilled fish was fantastic.  A bit of a miscommunication between my husband and the waitress about being gluten free.  The serving staff and owner were very kind, apologetic, and made immediate strides to whip something else up.  All in all, a respectable time."}
{"text":"I selected this place based on all the great Yelp reviews, and all I can say is that I was very disappointed.  I'm fine with it being kind of a dive...my issue was with the food.  We both got ceviche apps, which were pretty good.  I had a fish filet & my BF had the dish with chicken, shrimp and beef (forget what it's called).  I found the food to be pretty salty, which I can't stand.  My fish was swimming in some kind of liquid, which totally turned me off & the salad it came with was drowned in some kind of yellow Italian dressing (Wish Bone out of the bottle?  not sure).  My BF's dish was ok at best...the beef was chewy & the shrimp & chicken were salty.  I hate to be so harsh, but I gotta call 'em as I see 'em.  Would def. not return."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Complimentary ceviche was fantastic and so were the shrimp tacos!!!  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Having grown up in Tucson and traveled extensively in Mexico since the 70's, I'm pretty picky about Mexican food in Arizona.  Mariscos Playa Hermosa is really good!   I definitely would drive out of my way to eat here.   We are going back tomorrow for dinner before the Arizona Coyotes game.  Can't wait.   Have not had a bad dish yet at this place.   Too bad I live all the way in North Scottsdale or I'd go more often."}
{"text":"Best seafood and service. I recommend to everyone I know or just meet. Love the soups and the ceviches. Yum!"}
{"text":"Had a great family reunion dinner for 12.  Food was excellent, service was attentive, but not overbearing and the live music was wonderful.  Thank you for a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"If I could give this place more than five stars I would. When we found this place on our way through Phoenix we found a gem. It was packed and rightly so. The food was fresh, authentic and really really delicious and the service are great too! They even had a mariachi band."}
{"text":"Wow. And OMG. If not for the stellar reviews and the tip that they have a live mariachi band on Friday and Sunday evenings, we never would have made the trip. So very glad we did! Very colorful decor. Bright and welcoming. I don't know if reservations are required but we had one and were seated immediately. Our waitress, Brenda, came right over with chips and got our drinks. She was very patient and helpful, answering all the questions we had. I don't even remember the names of the dishes we had... I think one was the Veracruz style fish. Delicious!!!! We didn't order appetizers but she brought out two small complimentary ones that whet our appetites for more. The mariachi band was excellent and very entertaining. The young lady had a wonderful voice and could hold a note forever! Finished off by forcing (only because I was already stuffed and have zero willpower) a piece of awesome carrot cake. We will be back! So very glad we found this gem! Sabor! (I don't speak Spanish. Hope I used that correctly!)"}
{"text":"Really wanted to love love love this place. The service was great and liked the decor. The food wasn't amazing though. I got the garlic shrimp, which seemed more buttery than garlicky. Husband muscled through his fish tacos. Kiddos didn't want to eat what looked like Costco chicken nuggets.  I did like my giant margarita. The amuse-bouche (ceviche) was phenomenal."}
{"text":"If you have a service dog, (legit) they'll make you sit on the patio. When we showed our papers and questioned why we had to sit outside when it's cold. They came back and said they couldn't serve us cause we're drunk! Which wasn't the case, the person who needs the dog has severe anxiety and is a little intense with a disability. We were extremely offended and upset, but gladly left."}
{"text":"Everything was so good - service, food, atmosphere.  I had the caldo siete mares (seven seas soup).  The broth was so good and the fish was so tender.  Also a huge bowl.  Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"This place has awesome seafood!! The place is small and cute, with a beach theme. They make awesome Micheladas for curing a hang over. We had a dozen oysters, which were delish! I had some fried shrimp and fish  and a shrimp ceviche tostada. It was Scrumptious!! Next time I'm in Phoenix I will be sure to visit this place."}
{"text":"Have you ever experienced molcajete? HAVE YOU?!  This is THE place to have that experience. I say \"experience\" because molcajete is more like a witch's bubbling brew than a meal. Mariscos is a cozy little restaurant in an area a lot of people won't flock to, but it stays busy. All the good stuff applies here... friendly service, great food, Mexican beers, Mariachis (on Fridays, I believe). It's just a great place. And, now that the formalities are out of the way, I can talk about the molcajete.   Molcajete is actually the name of the stone bowl that is used more traditionally as a mortar for salsas and such. As a dish though, it's a beautiful mixture of spicy/tangy sauce, grilled meats, grilled veggies, and cheese. It's one of my favorite Mexican dishes, period. Mariscos serves theirs with tons of fixins (beans, tortillas, salsas, etc.) that could probably fill two people up on their own, but their generous serving is much appreciated when ordering this dish for a small group. It's definitely one of those meals that'll impress people when it gets served. Order one for the table, and you're going to have a good time.  I could spout on all day about molcajete... But, would ya look at that, I have a decent size review already, and I haven't even talked about the restaurant's specialty, seafood. Well, I'll let you read some other reviews for that. I'll just say that I love their tostadas de ceviche de camaron!   Go to Mariscos Playa Hermosa, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came back to try more stuffs... it was kind of disappointing to be honest. This time I tried the Camarones culichi and a dozen of fresh oyster on the half shells ... Camarones culichi... the sauce is pretty good! However, it was overpriced as hell.... it was a small bowl portion with 6 shrimps in a bowl of sauce and some cheese sprinkled on top. Way too expensive for a 15.99$   Oysters came out okay but to my surprised there was no cocktail sauce nor horse radish. It was only oysters and lime..... -_- you can imagine how fishy the taste is. 16.00$   Cocktail was good as last time. $15.99  We don't get complimentary ceviche this time :( I wonder why"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, this place was absolutely delish! The fish came succulent yet fried crisp on the outside... A very hard task indeed! And the poblano sauce was phenomenal over the top. The shrimp was great. It's on the lighter side if you have a smaller appetite compared to the dishes ur still generous. The seasoning is on the saltier end of the spectrum but it tasted perfect to me for this kind of cuisine. Mmmmmm! My only regret is not having a place like this in NYC."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite spot for seafood, however they became very popular and they got more chairs and tables inside of the restaurant and some places also to eat outside however it's very crowded to sit, stand and move between other tables and the waitress coming around a lot, that you can't really enjoy your experience...maybe outside is less trouble? But then I'm not sure how often the waitress will notice you are there... Also I'm not sure if they have properly exits in case of a fire...having so many costumers inside can be a  problem without the emergency exits... I don't know I have kids so I'm always trying to figure out how to protect them. The restaurant offers a free small ceviche tostada as appetizer per person, make sure to ask to get it, a few times our waitress has forgot to bring it to our table."}
{"text":"First time here, wow this place was amazing. We had the molcajete and it was amazing. Great atmosphere and our server Brenda took great care of us :) we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A decent spot to eat at. Our waitress wasn't as fast as she could have been considering it wasn't packed. Most of the food was tasty especially the molcajete but we had three complaints that kept coming up around the table. The fish was very sub-par, over cooked, and over seasoned. The rice was a little soggy and it was very tasteless, it was almost hard to eat to be honest. To finish it off the salsa was very watery and it felt like it was missing something. All In all, it was an alright spot I doubt we will be going back considering the long drive but I wouldn't count it out for good."}
{"text":"First off I prefer Mariscos Sinaloa so we will continue to go there instead.  I was a bit afraid to park my vehicle outside in this neighborhood with all the locals walking around.  The ambiance inside the restaurant was cute and enjoyable.  The server just had a flat affect.  He was neither friendly or rude.  I thought the menu prices were a bit high.  We paid the full prices for lunch on a weekend.  We got plenty of free chips and the two salsas.  I really enjoyed the green one.  We did not receive any free tostadas like other yelpers report receiving.  The portion sizes were good and I left full with some leftovers.  My son is 12 years old and tried a half order of Oysters on the half shell.  It was his first time trying oysters and he really liked them.  I ordered a bean and cheese burrito, the cheese enchiladas and quacamole to share with my two little girls.  We really enjoyed the beans, the rice (and I am not usually a fan of rice!), and the guacamole.  The enchiladas were just okay."}
{"text":"Great food! Loved the ceviche and the different shrimp combinations! Great service and nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Went here instead of our usual San Carlos Mariscos on 18th st and McDowell because of the reviews. This place is more dressed up (despite outward appearances) but it's also more expensive for the same quality food.  We got the shrimp culichi and the shrimp veracruzano and both were solid but at almost $15/meal we definitely expected more than 6 shrimp. We wouldn't deter people from going here but I would suggest San Carlos instead if asked."}
{"text":"Everything was authentic and hit the spot. My fiance ordered the shrimp culichi and I ordered shrimp cocktail. Shrimp culichi is really a curry shrimp. We really liked the raw oyster appetizer. It was so fresh and delicious. The horxhata had little pieces of strawberry, melon, and mango that added a dimension of flavor to rice drink. The michelada was pretty awesome too. Pretty happy we found this place."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious!! The molcajete was the bomb! Waitress was very helpful and good service from all the restaurant... free complimentary fish tostada delicious.. the horchata is the best I ever try!"}
{"text":"Grilled fish tacos were pretty good. Lots of cheese in them, but I'm not complaining. Does take a bit of time to get your food, but the place was packed. Very small parking lot, you'll likely have to park on the street if you come on a busy night like we did this Saturday."}
{"text":"Great fresh sea food!  Best I have had in Phoenix, clean and great service.  Do not let the neigbor hood scare you away, this place is great.  Crab enchalads are the best.  Ceveche is as good as I have found.  I will be back soon."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an extraordinary authentic restaurant that specializes in seafood Mexican style this is your place. My wife and I went and enjoyed all the dishes that we had. It was well worth the wait. The staff was very helpful they all speak English but we speak Spanish. Would definitely make sure that you do try this place! We had live music which was another great experience to have United States. They unique...  Will be going back shortly"}
{"text":"I've tried every Marisco spot in phoenix and this place is on another level. Great staff , amazing food and good tres leches cake. Food always Is fresh and the appetizers are out of this world good. I ate here 2 times in one week when I first found out about it."}
{"text":"really great food and nice environment. Cant wait to go again and try something else. This place is definitely a must try."}
{"text":"It's very hard to find a good seafood restaurant in Phoenix.  The service was great.  Our waitress checked with us a lot making sure we had everything we needed.    Clean restaurant.  It wasn't busy but I hear that it gets packed for lunch.  Their Hibiscus juice (jugo de Jamaica) was delicious."}
{"text":"Decor is amazing in this hidden joint! My review is based only on 3 tacos and the nachos... Chicken taco, fish taco and barbacoa taco. All were very good and the nachos with green chile avocado salsa is absolutely delicious!!! Our waiter had to keep refilling our bowl - it was that good.   I will be back to try the seafood at this little gem especially the volcano (I think that was the name) which was sizzling next to us. It entailed fish, shrimp and steak - mmmmmm!"}
{"text":"This place was a lot of fun. They had a band playing in their during dinner. We will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"This place by far beats any marisco place I've been too in the city of Phoenix. It's cleanliness and attention to detail on the preparation of their food compares to any Mexican playa dish! I strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone starving for some good mariscos!"}
{"text":"I'm taking my dad here.  This place is pretty authentic- made me long for a beach in lareado.   The Hunny and I had a dozen oysters (not a good choice but not bad any means)  We downed those with tapatio and fresh lime.   Then we had ceviche.  So good! I loved it. It was hearty with great lime sauce.   I had the fish tacos and he had shrimp and fish veracruz or something.  Both were good- did it taste like the freshest fish of all time? no.  Did I eat it anyways because it tasted like Baja California. Yup.   I really like this place.  They also have the fat boy's favorite mexican beer- bohemia."}
{"text":"Great service and very friendly staff. The food was good, especially the Shrimp Albondigas."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite mariscos place ever. All of their food is tasty! I always get their cóctel de camarón which is almost as good as my dad's (can't beat home cooking). I've also had their tacos, fajitas, and camarones endiablados (super spicy). Their micheladas are some of the best and they have all the good Mexican beers (Victoria, Pacifico, and Modelo). They can also accommodate large parties. I had my bday dinner here and had about 20 people attend. On Sundays, they have mariachi starting at 4pm, so make sure to check it out during that time, but they do get busy."}
{"text":"We came for the ceviche which was not average. I it's more of a cocktail style then lime. The child replenish was okay, the cheese wasn't fully melted inside. The service was however great and food accommodations were made with no issues."}
{"text":"I would give this place 10 stars if I could. My dad was craving ceviche, so I decided to take them to Mariscos Playa Hermosa. There is a reason the reviews for this restaurant is so high - it has great food, great service, and beautiful furniture/ decorations.   Before we received our order, we were given chips + salsa/guac. The chips were very oily and I wasn't a big fan, but that initial impression was soon overcome with the best tasting ceviche on top of a crispy corn tortilla. My mom, who isn't a fan of cilantro, said that it was the highlight of her meal.   My dad and I decided to share the House Special/ Molcajete ($30 for two people), which consisted of shrimps, two tilapila pieces, two chicken slices, and two beef slices in green sauce. It came with corn tortillas, rice, beans, and salad. None of my family members can eat spicy foods, but there is also an option for the \"Diablo\" sauce, which I heard is pretty spicy. We were definitely not let down - it was just the right taste and the right temperature. My mom got the garlic shrimp (I think it was $13?) and the portion for the main piece was relatively small-medium in size, but it also came with rice, beans, and salad. She liked the clean taste.  The service was great; our waitress constantly checked in to see if we needed anything. The noise level was loud because there were constantly people coming in and out of the restaurant, but that signifies just how many people are fans of this restaurant. Also, for anyone who's curious, there are TVs (might be good for game-days).  At the end of our meal, we got a free coconut cake by checking in to Yelp, and the cream on the cake was delicious; the icing tasted like a sweeter version of coconut ice cream. When we were finished, we were way too stuffed. Dad said that we should come back again with the aunts - that's one of the rare times I've ever heard him say, \"let's come back again\".   Highly recommended! If you like seafood + Mexican food, go here."}
{"text":"So to start off, be careful coming from the south and turning right into the street cause we got a flat turning into the parking lot. You will hit the curb, we saw the person after us hit the curb also and then the guy from our insurance that came to change our tire also said he hit it too.   The place is very small feels very crowded especially with the band. WAY too loud, could barely hear the waitress or my boyfriend so didn't even bother talking much.   Food was good(had the shrimp ceviche )even though mine came out wrong at first, and I'm sure she forgot about one of my orders cause I had to ask about it.   Definitely not a place for babies/kids. They don't have changing tables!! Had to go to my car and change my baby in the hot car!! Big big negative!!  Waitress was nice, but they have them all over the place so I had to ask another worker twice to get our waitress cause she never passes by us to even be able to wave her down.  I would recommend it for couples/grownups only"}
{"text":"Today was the third time I come to this place and the first review I make. I am giving it 4 stars for the overall experience.  However,  being here 3 times now I can say that some of the reviews are correct, service is a hit and miss, the food depending on what you order will vary as well. We had the \"Molcajete\" which is a must order serves 2-4 depending on how hungry you are. And we had the \"Mojara Frita\" whole fried fish. Both come with rice, beans, and a little salad. It was all good and filling.   If you are in a hurry don't come here, this is one of those places that is meant to be enjoyed at a slow pace. Order,  eat chips and salsa, have a drink, chit chat and wait for your food. Atmosphere is great!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican sea food in Arizona! The food was 100% cooked to perfection the quality in all the flavor and salsas they offered were outstanding. The service was fast and instant very friendly staff and the bar will get you tippsy because they make the best drinks I've ever had at a restaurant.."}
{"text":"Great mariscos in Phoenix ,Arizona  Agualiches are the bomb, El Capitan platter , tostadas de ceviche . Our waitress has the best personality. The only thing with this place is that you are only going to hear Reguetton music ."}
{"text":"Mariachis on a Friday night is the perfect compliment to the fine Mexican seafood cuisine! Seriously. Try the molcajete.  Mouthwatering goodness.   Their rice and beans are delicious not bad for the basics of Mexican cuisine.  The sea bass here is fluffy and crisp of fried. Yummy all around.  Great food. Great service.  Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Located in not the nicest neighborhood of Phoenix, Mariscos Playa Hermosa seems a bit shady on the outside. Once you get pasted the secretive tinted windows, however, it's an entirely different world. Vibrant colors hit your eyes and vivacious music pleases your eardrums. It really makes you feel like you're near a playa hermosa.   To start off, we were given a complimentary hard tortilla with ceviche on it. You can taste how fresh and delectable the combination of ingredients is. I've had plenty of ceviche in Latin American countries and theirs is on par.   The selection here is ridiculous, but in a good way. I ended up going simple and ordering some shrimp tacos. You get 3 tacos with rice, beans, and salad. The tacos don't include any filler ingredients like Americans prefer. Just straight up shrimp smothered in oozing melted cheese. Can't get much more legit than that. The rice, beans, and salad were all pretty typical and were a good compliment to the meal.   Thank you Marisocs Playa Hermosa for fulfilling my friend's craving for amazing legit Mexican food after being stuck in the Romney infested part of Colorado for a year. The service is warm and friendly, decor is unexpected but awesome, and the food is as close as you can get without crossing the border."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Best Mariscos in Phoenix so far I had the fish fillet with the vegetables so flavorful. We had a few michialadas and margarita corona. Great customer service. My new spot I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Very Good Family owned Sinaloan Style Mexican SEAFOOD Restaurant that's open everyday for lunch and dinner. Prices are reasonable I'd say the average plate price runs about $13.00. Most of the menu is seafood so plan on having seafood if you come here.   I've been here several times over the years and I'd say most of the time but not always they start you off with a complimentary mini fish tostada that delicious with your chips and salsas.  I can vouch for the Fish Veracruzana and the Fish Poblano plates because I had them before and the fish was light ,fresh tasting and flaky. The sauce and toppings  is really what made these dishes good to me. They come with your usual rice and beans and tortillas. They have many choices in this kind of dish.  Last time I was here the place was packed and we were the only table in the place that didn't order the Molcajete so I wanted to order it this time.  The Molcajete is a boiling hot caldron filled with your choice of Diablo Hot Chipotle sauce or Tomatillo Sauce. The menu that we had reads Fish, Shrimp, and Beef. But what we received was Battered Fish, Shrimp, Beef, Chicken and Octopus. The Diablo sauce is very hot and spicy but also very tasty and I found myself adding it everything I ate. Over all I thought it was good and fun to share. It cost $22.00 and feeds at least two people. It also comes with rice , beans and tortillas. If you get the Molcajete you should eat the shrimp first because they get over cooked just sitting on the hot Molcajete as ours did. I'm not a beef person but I thought the beef came out prepared the best in this dish.  I do note you should view the photo of the building so you know what the outside looks like before you give this place a try."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant I've ever eaten at! Next time in Phoenix will be back! Friendly service and good prices!"}
{"text":"Drinks, chips, salsa, guacamole, and shrimp dishes were sublime.  The atmosphere is warm, pretty, and everyone we saw there was very nice, the service was great.  But, only three stars because this was just the first visit and we weren't over the moon. That said, I'll *definitely go back * to enjoy all the good stuff and retry a few dishes -- and it's about 1/2 hour drive for us across town, that is, it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"I very rarely give a restaurant 5 stars, much less a Mexican restaurant since I do not like Mexican food.  This place really does deserve all 5 stars.  I ordered the al pastor tacos with rice and beans.  I asked for them to hold the beans.  I loved the rice!  Very different than expected.  The order came with 3 al pastor tacos.  The place was only $8.99!  Perfect!  They also gave us a ceviche tostada before our meal.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love MPH. Have been here three or four times in the last year. They have never disappointed. Everything I have sampled off their menu has been delicious."}
{"text":"I'm gonna have to join all the 5-star reviewers.  This place is TOTALLY AWESOME !!  (forgive my usage of the cliched 80s standby, but this applies here !!)   Everything was just about right.  The service was prompt and helpful. The salad was fresh and crispy. The rice was filled with little chunks of green beans and carrots and I think corn too. The refried beans were not overly fatty nor were they overly salty. The guacamole was chunky and tasty, with BIG chunks of avocado. The corn tortillas were light, soft, and fresh. The Shrimp culichi sauce was so good that I was eating it with a spoon. The Negra Modelo on tap in a 28-oz glass for $3 was a super-bargain and Oh So Cold and Yummy. The chips were hot and fairly thick and a little oily - top notch. The red salsa was smokey and had a bit of kick. The green tomatillo/avocado salsa was about the best I've had in town. OH YES I ALMOST FORGOT:  They gave me an \"on the house\" Ceviche tostada, and it was the BEST Ceviche I have EVER tasted.  I don't normally like it, but this was SCRUMPTIOUS.  Can't wait for tomorrow to munch on the leftovers.  This place is not only a great Mexican SEAFOOD restaurant - it's about as good as any REGULAR Mexican restaurant in town.  Miss out on trying this place? That would be a bad move."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try the caldo siete mares at this place! Failed... it was tasteless room temperature water with a few spices and a lot of fish, a couple of shrimp and an oyster. Very disappointing! I was expecting a lot more since this place has good reviews.   Never again! Learned my lesson."}
{"text":"I am really crazy about this place, we are from Pasadena CA but find ourselves in Phoenix about twice a year. Each visit we must go to MPH to enjoy what is the best Mexican seafood in the southwest.   Where to start? Nearly the whole menu is good. Start with shrimp or mixed seafood cocktail and then move onto the seafood platters. Fried Fish, shrimp, abalone, it's very tasty and well done.   If you're not in a seafood mood they're pretty good about that too. We recently tried the \"volcano\" (sorry the Spanish names fail me) with various meet and seafood cooked in a lava pit of red or green sauce and cheese, and that was delicious.   Wash it all down with Margaritas combined with Beer: literally they serve a Margarita + Beer combo that I order every time and it's the greatest way to accompany the meal.  Service is excellent: the waitresses are skilled, knowledgeable about the menu, and happy to serve you promptly.  The decor, made up of hand-carved and hand-painted Mexican-style wooden furniture, is exquisite and really brightens up the dining area.  Overall it's a wonderful dining experience and well recommended."}
{"text":"Food is AMAZING! We've come here for date night 3 times and it never disappoints.  Love the mariachi band and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Earlier in the day we were vastly disappointed at another restaurant, but didn't want to just chuck it in so we came for drinks - and left stunned how appetizing the food coming out of the kitchen was.  Our server was attentive and answered our many questions about the food that was coming out.  I had the mango margarita and it was A REAL MANGO not the flavoring and ice that some places do.    The parking is on the more difficult side, but that isn't stopping us from coming back.  We plan on inviting my roommate to give it go.  I'm working downtown so I will be popping in to enjoy it soon.   Loved the interior."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service is very good. I always ask for Margarita. We always bring friends from California to enjoy the great food"}
{"text":"It was everything that I wanted. I don't know why I have to write out a long paragraph on this place other than it was fantastic the food was excellent and I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever. I can't believe they aren't packed. We have been there a couple times however I dont know if it's the location or poor advertising. Just give it a try."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I've been eating here for several years, from when I worked at the health dept and it was right out the back door.  It's in kind of a weird neighborhood just west of the projects, but not too horrible.  The ceviche is excellent, but my favorite by far is the Viagra Soup (yes, it really is called that) which is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Amazing and authentic food. The octopus is something I will dream about for days!! Great atmosphere and fun decor to enjoy. So busy we couldn't find parking!"}
{"text":"I live in Southern California and we came from there on Sunday and we happen to have Easter lunch it's very hard to find a good place that serves seafood especially when the ocean is nowhere to be found very glad that we found this place in the middle of the desert"}
{"text":"Food average. Horrible service. I waited 15 min before getting drinks even though there is couple of tables."}
{"text":"Very friendly service.   Ceviche tostadas (shrimp and fish) underwhelming, somewhat better with very generous application of lime but still not great. Bizarrely, supplied with a basket of saltines--in reality, much better on the complementary starter tortilla chips.   Camarones culichi too cheesy but otherwise a very nice sauce. The whole fried fish was great.   Flan was too firm in texture and not particularly remarkable in flavor."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good authentic Mexican meal before we left Phoenix and we weren't disappointed. Staff was attentive and courteous. We ordered the camerones rancheros and the baked salmon. Both of us were completely satisfied. The waitress brought out a pair of ceveche tostadas to start ant they were delicious, light and fresh. Stop by on a warm afternoon and enjoy their patio with a few friends."}
{"text":"I really likes this place. We has the Plato Capitan and it was delicious! Lots of food on the plate at a good price. Such a pretty restaurant too. Saturday nights are busy so be prepared to wait, but it is so worth it! Your date will be impressed!! The menu has a lot to choose from and will keep you coming back to try more. You gotta come here!!"}
{"text":"Wow. I'm embarassed I didn't know about this place earlier. And I call myself a Phoenician?  I came here for dinner last night after reading the review by Sabrina, who ought to be awarded the Nobel Prize for something for discovering this place. I almost don't want to write this review because it'll spoil the surprises you're in store for when you visit.   It begins when you pull into the parking lot and eye the shady looking exterior, but then step inside. The owner has gone to great lengths to decorate with a unique theme of Mexican life on the sea. I was charmed the instant I opened the door.   The menu is your next surprise. Not one item on the first three pages is anything you've ordered before at any other Mexican restaurant. The dishes are all seafood based, including crab, octopus, and lots of shrimp. What says it all is the description on the last page of the menu that offers \"Mexican food\", where you can get the standard fare of cheese enchiladas etc.   What I say next I do not say lightly. As of right now, this place serves THE BEST, #1, salsa in the state of Arizona. This is based on a lifetime growing up in this state and sampling salsas hundreds upon hundreds of times at our best Mexican restaurants from Ajo to Tucson to Springerville. When my dinner companion told the owner how much she liked the salsa he remarked to us that it was a new recipe. There are actually two salsas that come with the chips, one a reddish green variety and the other being avocado-based. The avocado based one is also excellent, but it's the reddish green one that simply blows me away with its combination of flavor and just the right amount of spiciness. We wolfed it down so quickly he brought us a second bowl within minutes of our sitting down.   Our next surprise came after we ordered our entrees. The owner walked up to our table and put down two small plates of what I can only describe as seafood tostadas. This is evidently yet another free appetizer that comes with all meals. Picture a mini-tostada shell, on top of which is a well-marinated collection of what I think were tiny pieces of salmon, tomato, onion and green peppers. Everything fresh and with just a bit of a kick to it. Again, wow.   My entree was good, though I'll definitely order something new next time. The crab enchiladas come with a unique style of preparing the rice and beans, and a fresh salad as well. I wasn't a huge fan of the crab filling to be honest, but not because of quality or preparation reasons, more so my own personal taste. I'm going for a shrimp dish next time.  The owner was serving customers himself when I was there and he's an extremely friendly and polite Mexican gentleman. He's created a gem in this part of midtown Phoenix which isn't particularly known for its restaurants."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place based on all the positive reviews.  I thought this Mexican seafood restaurant would bring me back to my favorite seafood restaurant in Playa del Carmen.  Unfortunately, this is just bad seafood, not matter the type.  I ordered the seafood ceviche and it was not fresh at all. Several of the seafood items  were soft from spoilage (as opposed to tender) and smelled fishy.  I decided to stop after a few bites because I didn't want risk getting sick since I was about to get on a plane.  I may have been fine finishing the dish but I didn't see the need to play seafood roulette."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant because of the high reviews but didn't have the same experience. Service wasn't the greatest ( ordered sour cream and guacamole as sides and had to remind waitress when my food came without them then when the sour cream finally came from a different waitress , no guacamole again, I finally gave up. The food was only okay. Loved the salsa. The mariachi band was so loud it actually hurt my ears. I'm assuming they never turned the amplifiers down from the Saturday nite before."}
{"text":"Here in Phoenix I think that we are pretty lucky to have such diversity in each neighborhood. Particularly South Phoenix where you can find great Soul Food at Lolo's Chicken and Waffles, Pizza at Amano, and of course various different types and regions of Mexican food. When I say Mexican food I'm really referring to the sort of hole in the wall, real deal family owned operations that are all over the south side of Phoenix. So many of them dot each street corner and call like the Sirens of the night. Marisco's Playa Hermosa is exactly what I mean by this.  \"We bring the sea to the desert\" is their slogan and it's so true. Stepping inside you'll feel like you were just transported to Mazatlán, Mexico, the only things missing here is the ocean. The place is just splashed with bright colors with hand carved tables and birds with a welcoming and friendly staff. With so much to take in it's hard to focus on any one thing, though with so many bird carvings hanging from the ceiling I almost felt like I was in the Tiki Room at Disneyland, less the chatter of the birds of course.   Chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant can be a very good benchmark to judge the rest of your meal, Marisco's would have to be at the top of these tests. Their chips are slightly thick, warm and a little on the oily side, this way the salt can adhere well to them. Accompanying are 2 different salsa, red and green. The red has a certain sweet and hot bitterness that is tasty and even better when washed down with a cold beer. The green is made of creamy avocado and with a warm chip is absolutely delicious. Neither were very hot but that's the thing with real deal Mexican food, its not always hot and spicy. So you'll have no reason to expect the \"burning ring of fire\" the next day!   With so many different and tasty sounding items to choose from, deciding was pretty tough as I really enjoy some good seafood. So imagine this, 8 large perfectly cooked shrimp, swimming in a creamy tomatillo and cilantro sauce, then topped with a sprinkling of cheese. If this sounds like something you would enjoy then go ahead and order the Camarones Culichi ($13.99). You will also get a basket of hot fresh corn or flour tortillas for dunking as well as rice, beans and a fresh lettuce salad dressed with lime juice. The beans have a nice texture with good flavor but the rice is nice! Well steamed and seasoned, the rice has a bright white color which might look bland, but after one bite you'll be wrapping it up in a hot tortilla and dunking it into the beans.   The Mojarra Frita ($15), a fried whole fried fish, sounds and looks good, but decided to be more like a daddy's little girl and order something less involved. Crab Enchilada's ($13) are not only the house specialty but are good to the last bite. 3 corn tortillas over stuffed with sweet crab meat, rolled together with cheese and covered in a slightly spicy red sauce. Again with the rice, beans and salad this is a pretty large plate and for the money, a great value. The enchiladas were actually featured in Gourmet Magazine at one time, who knew?  On the back of the menu you'll find a section called Camida Mexicana which are plates of regular Mexican fare such as burritos, taco's and fajitas. Not trying the Carne Asada Taco's ($6.99) would be a real shame since the meat is so tender and the flavor so beefy. A plate full of 3 tacos, double tortilla, chopped beef and onions, with rice and beans is both satisfying and ample. Douse the tacos with some of the guacamole salsa and you'll have a party on your plate! The Quesadilla ($7.99) is just cheese and a tortilla, while good it was quite ordinary. However the smell from the Fajitas De Pollo ($10.99) was amazing! I'll have those to myself next time!  For dessert you can stick with maybe a Mexican Coke ($2) made with real sugar or a large glass of over ice Horchata ($2.50). Though for something more, the Flan ($4) was different than what you normally get. More cake like and dense than silky smooth, it was decent enough and a nice finish to so many savory dishes. Otherwise there aren't any other desserts offers, like you'll have room after such good sized portions anyway.   Marisco's Playa Hermosa is a real gem and has the menu, friendliness and comfortable vibe to back it up. While the neighborhood feels a bit on the seedy side, as they say, nothing ventured, nothing gained?"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, I just moved to AZ from CA, we definitely don't have anything like this in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Good food & good ambient Try the tostada embarasada The micheladas are good too They play mariachi on sunday"}
{"text":"I love their ceviche tostada! It's so fresh and flavorful. This place is as authentic as it can get. Our server was so friendly and sweet. Thumbs up to the first restaurant we chose in Phoenix while visiting from Austin, TX!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful restaurant! Great food; the shrimp cocktail was delicious! I will be returning & highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is very authentic and SO GOOD! I have gone twice now, and the food was very tasty both times. If you are in a big group, I recommend the Fiesta Taco platter, it comes with 16 filling tacos!"}
{"text":"Over hyped and mediocre food at best, slow service on a slow night along with high prices, probably will not return. *the only high notes, the house margarita and the check."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it.  My daughter and I happened upon this place and what a pleasant surprise.  There is plenty of parking for a city location.  The decor and ambience is a perfect 10.  It's casual and interesting at the same time.  The chips are good but the salsa, while being high quality, wasn't my favorite.  The enchiladas, on the other hand, were perfect.  The sauce tasted completely homemade and delicious.  I had the red and green sauces and they couldn't have been better.  My daughter wanted her burrito done a particular way and they nailed it without any complaint.  This is just a high quality Mexican restaurant with nice people as servers and an interesting atmosphere.  Furthermore, the coke was perfect.  You know how some coke tastes more like Cherry Coke or there isn't enough fizz or there is too much fizz.  Best coke I have ever had was here.  This place is a winner!"}
{"text":"Primera ves en este lugar y estubo muy bueno mis respetos ordene un molcajete y estubo vien masiso mi esposa una campechana y mi hija 2 tostadas de ceviche y todo estubo muy bueno"}
{"text":"Food wasn't the greatest. I ordered \"ceviche de camaron\" and I got was a bowl full of veggies and some shrimp.), which cost me $11.00. The green Chile beef burrito was overcooked shreaded meat, no flavor. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm just a Bostonian who has basically been totally awed by Arizona in general, but seriously this place was totally amazing.  Not only did they give us salsa and chips (both delicious) to start our meal, but also a small serving of cerviche which was fantastic. And the meals were SO BIG. We were just two people, and after we both ordered a meal and a margharita, the waiter asked us, \"is that all?\" and we were worried we hadn't ordered enough but it turned out we ordered too much. And oh my gosh it was so good.  The server recommended shrimp in green sauce, and we also go the octopus. Amazing! As a side note, the beer serving was also huge. The atmosphere was perfect, there was copious parking, the restaurant was maybe a 7 minute drive from our car rental. Everything was for the win!  They do close early (at least when we were there) so keep that in mind. But oh my gosh, thank you for your incredible Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Seriously good food...not cheap but worth it. Quality and quantity. Place is clean, colorful and service is quick. Bacon wrapped shrimp are phenomenal as well as the crab enchilada and shrimp ceviche."}
{"text":"Food was great I had the Ceviche de camarón just the right amount of shrimp and the server was sure to bring us everything we needed the drinks were refreshing I had a michelada and a mangoniada and it was perfect for this Arizona heat. Would definitely go again everything from the food to the service was great only thing we had trouble with was with parking it is kind of tight but then again we have a truck so I can't blame restaurant."}
{"text":"I need to start off by saying this place has the best micheladas I have ever had. Great for hangovers or to start your night. The seafood is top notch they have a very different tomatillo sauce that they serve with various dishes that is awesome. Give it a chance if your looking for a seafood spot."}
{"text":"Best mex seafood in the valley.  The staff is always very welcoming and attentive.  The grilled fillet of fish and the shrimp en diablo are two of my favorites.   The meals fill you up, without leaving you feeling heavy afterwards.   The salsas are amazing as well.   This place is just a great little seafood joint.   I recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Yummy mom and pop place.  Excellent ceviche and I love ordering the molcajete.  It comes bubbling and filled to the brim with seafood goodies served in a volcanic rock container.  The chips could use a little work, but with all the plentiful Pacificos that come on out, I don't generally notice or remember by the end."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great vibe and decor, the food is to die for. I approve.  The molcajete is a must with chicken and steak and shrimp in a delicious melted cheese dip.  All the while you have great drinks and mariachi."}
{"text":"I got the Camaron culichi it was really good, but has to wait on my tortillas, husband got the shrimp/ pulpo cocktail with no onion but came with extra it seemed like, serve was extremely bad never came to our table to see how we were doing if we needed any crackers for the shrimp cocktail, I asked for a soda with a cup of ice got the soda no cup of ice had to wait 10 minutes for my ice had to ask another waitress, asked for one taco of carne Asada no onion Took another 10 minutes, asked for the bill and that came out in one minute not sure if I would be going back the service sucked."}
{"text":"This is the most fantastically delicious Mexican food I have ever had. We started out with a fish ceviche followed by a shrimp ceviche. My daughter had a sea bass grilled and my son ordered a chille relleno. My wife ordered a carne asada fajita. Then we ordered a Molcajete Caliente for 2. This comes in a stone bowl with green sauce and cheese. It has shrimps, fish, carne asada and chicken. All hung on the hot stone bowl like a shrimp coctail!! Needless to say we all were eating each others food!! It hits your taste buds from every direction!! Yum!! We thought we would finish the meal with a flaan. How wrong we were! We just had to order another one. It was so delicious. The quantity is right up there with the quality. We had to pack up the left overs to go. There is no way I was going to let one ounce of this feast go waste. The service was exceptional. Our hostess/server was there like a genie. Water glasses were filled before they got empty, hot tortias appeared by magic, lime when requested materialised. Even when we awkwardly spilled a glass of water, it was soaked dry with a smile. I wish I could have this meal more often. I know that every time I come to Phoenix, they will have to deal with me!!  :-) :-)."}
{"text":"Love it! Food was amazing. We got the molcajete for two in salsa verde (green sauce), is a delicious combination of seafood, chicken and beef, served in a hot bowl made out of rock. It was YUMMY! Place is nice, great decoration, fair prices. Service was wonderful, fast, attentive and kind. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Yelp has led me to another amazing joint for food.  I went to Mariscos Playa Hermosa with family for my brother's birthday and this place blew my socks off. The food and staff were equally responsible for why I left wishing this gem was closer to my residence. From beginning to end, our visit was great.   For the food, we started with guac. and a shrimp cocktail. The guac. was so flavorful and man, they jammed so much shrimp in the great cocktail. What a start!!! Next we ordered the Molcajete Caliente (shrimp, beef, chicken, fish, octopus in a green sauce). As we were anticipating the arrival of our dish they brought us all out a complimentary ceviche tostada. This was my first ceviche and I was impressed. Not saying much though since I have nothing to compare it to :). Now for the Molcajete, I loved it so much. Every meat was perfectly cooked and the boiling hot green sauce was perfect. To go with the meat, they provide each person with their own tortillas, beans, and rice. Okay, the tortillas were good, the beans were good, but the rice was the best I have had. I just loved everything about the dish. I would eat it for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and then do it all over again the next day.  As for service and as mentioned above, it was equally impressive. I wish I remembered the young ladies name but she provided wonderful service. She checked on us often and always did it with a smile. The staff also came in at the tail end of the meal and sang the happy birthday song to my brother. What I have never seen before is they sang it first in English and then Spanish. What a cool idea.   My family will be back again soon and you should stop in too."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous!  Why do so many people fixate on the location?  The food was super delicious, Mexican + seafood, where could things go wrong."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I get excellent service and good food!  Love this place. Great ambience, too. Great furniture."}
{"text":"The best burrito I have had in a long time and the service was great.  They gave us a complimentary ceviche tostada and it was yummy."}
{"text":"If you want to be around some amazing art, good music (Mexican and American) and great food this is where you want to go. The shrimp is soooooo good and so is the chicken. I've been here a couple of times and every time is a perfect experience! The staff is very educated and they come check up on you so that you aren't running low on drinks. You should try it !!! You won't regret it !"}
{"text":"Bomb!!!! So ever since I've been back in AZ from LA I've been on the search for a great michelada and amazing ceviche...well search is officially complete. Great Service and great food will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The real deal. My new favorite Mexican place. I had some pablano fish dish, it was excellent. Place was packed but service was fast, not expensive."}
{"text":"This place has the best mojarra frita in Arizona and the best margaritas. We drink virgen margaritas and we can taste the fruit in the drinks. Their salsa has a good kick to it, I'm picky with my salsa but this one passes the test. You should come try it if you like fish you will not be disappointed. Prices are also very reasonable. Check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"The decor and seating are by far the most interesting I've seen, hand carved tables and chairs!  The food was delicious, the margaritas were humungous, everything was simply splendid! We arrived and we had a private party table in the back room for a graduation, the decor is something to note.  It's like being in Mexico (not that we are too far away), I was thoroughly impressed with the hand crafted chairs and tables.  How did they fit them inside those tiny little rooms?  Did they build them in there?  How can I get these for my house?!  Anyways, food was great, service was at par, and the drinks were delicious.  The graduate said she went there all the time so, with fair pricing and good food.  This seems like a great place for a casual meal. Beware: Parking lot is super small, may be best to park on the street if you can't physically see parking as you pull up.  Also, make a reservation if possible, place was packed at 5:00pm on a Tuesday!"}
{"text":"For a Mexican restaurant and the area its located in it seemed really, really expensive. Our check for 2 people was $60. We both had 1 drink and 1 entree and split an appetizer.   The rating is highly influenced by the total price of the experience.  On to the food-- the ceviche was OK at best, it was comprised of 90% pico and 10% shrimp/fish. I've had ceviche from several dozen places and I'd have to rate this ceviche in the bottom 3 : /  The 'Camarones Fantasia' were very dry (over fried a little) and small for an order/the price. It came with 6 medium sized shrimps and should have been at least large or jumbo so as not to become so dry while cooking optimally. Ironically enough, I thought the actual taste was not terrible, but I could not describe them as \"succulent\" by any means.  The 'Camarones de Ajo' were very good but lacked some flavor that should have been there and that has been present in other Ajo dishes I have sampled throughout the US and Mexico.  The drinks were AWESOME! The micheladas were very great and by far the best part of the meal. However, they were the most expensive I have ever bought (40% more than the most touristy of spots in Mexico, which if you understand, is saying a lot!).   I'm quite confused how they can charge so much for the drinks and dishes here.  The experience was not \"bad\", but its certainly not a place I will return to anytime soon.  3 stars is the best I can give this place."}
{"text":"This restaurant isn't located in a very good part of town, but the food speaks for itself and is worth the travel. They serve Mexican-styled seafood but does offer non-seafood options for those seafood haters. Options are numerous and diverse. I ordered a fajita during my first visit so I couldn't attest to all their seafood dishes. However, the options I tasted were well-constructed and tasty. They were very judicious in their use of lime, which I greatly appreciate. My boyfriend ordered the chicken fajita and even the chicken was on par.  The restaurant itself is rather small and interior is vibrant. They pack a lot of people into this place. There is no wasted space. There were a lot of people there, and our wait was about 20 minutes. Most people sat on the patio as they waited for a table. To access the patio, you have to first walk through the restaurant. It's an awkward set-up. The patio itself was pretty decent. They had umbrellas and misters which kept everyone cool. The bathrooms look like they're newly renovated and were very clean. Our server was very nice and helpful, but there was definitely a language barrier. I appreciated her effort to understand and communicate with us."}
{"text":"Dine in experience   The place was pretty much dead on a early Monday afternoon so it was much appreciated the devoted attention we received from our server Veronica. We let her know we were out of town and was welcoming and helpful with the menu.   Ordered a Coctel Grande Campechana & a Carne Asada plate.  I can only go into detail regarding the Carne Asada plate seeing how this was my personal plate. The steak was tender and juicy (not dry at all). Beans & rice were good, nothing special but overall good. The Coctel was good according to my wife, not just full of juice like other places but a good amount of seafood in that cup   Friendly staff & good food makes this place a sure place to return to. Thanks to Hector (manager) for making our visit a pleasant one"}

{"text":"On a recent vacation to Mexico, my mom asked Jared and I where the best Mexican food in Phoenix was... This place immediately came to mind for us both!  When you walk into the door of Mariscos Playa Hermosa, you feel like you very well may be in Mexico.  It feels extremely authentic, with a festive atmosphere, a staff that doesn't speak too much English, and food that is delicioso!  It's nothing like the Americanized Mexican / Latin places  you've been to before.   Don't load up on the chips and salsa as the portions are big and you'll want to save room for what is to come.  Their house iced tea is very good if you want something other than a cold cerveza.  As Annie D said in her review, I highly recommend going with the Molcajete Caliente with verde sauce. You can't go wrong with that!  I ordered something else and ate off of Jared's Molcajete Caliente along with my own.  That sauce is incredible!  Note that this place closes early during the week.  We met some friends there at 7pm and at 8:20 we were the last ones in there and we could tell the staff was ready to go home.    I can't wait to return to this local gem of a restauran for another memorable meal very soon."}
{"text":"Phenomenal!  Get the molcajete, margaritas and finish with Flan.  Ok it's not in the best neighborhood but that's usually where the best food is.  I found this on YELP!  What a great find.  I love fish.  We ordered the Cerviche as an appetizer.  It was fresh and a great start.  I had a few Margaritas which were a tad weak but it's a great atmosphere with great food.  Again I recommend the Molcajete.  It's beef, pork, chicken and fish in a pot with great sauce.  Order it for 2 if you're hungry.  Otherwise, have fun and enjoy!"}
{"text":"From the moment that you walk in to the moment you leave. The service is amazing and the food is nothing short of phenomenal.  The food is fresh and the portions are quite shareable but most importantly it is authentic. The lemonade is fresh squeezed and the salsa happens to be quite delicious as well. Great job! Awesome food!"}
{"text":"Best seafood in Arizona hands down. I love this place just wish it was closer to home. The fish tacos are amazing."}
{"text":"Based on previous Reviews here, I had high hopes of something unique and different.  Felt wonderful and warm  inside with strolling Mariachis and a festive mood. Service was impeccable!  Unfortunately, the food was only okay. It seemed that much of the menu is served \"Fajitas Style\" (my words, not theirs) and the Shrimp, peppers and onions were nothing special, plus the portions I thought were small (eight medium sized shrimp). No \"knock you over\" flavors in this dish and the best thing about the meal was the wonderfully done rice.  Won't repeat as my disappointment will not go away any time soon."}
{"text":"Back for more and this place consistently serves wonderful Baja Mexican Seafood at a great price. Love it. Bonus free cake with my Yelp Check-in offer. Sweet!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurant. First word I would describe this place is authenticity. The food and drinks are unbelievably delicious. The waitresses are so friendly and it makes our dining experience amazing. Thanks Brenda, the waitress, for being so awesome. I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and they never disappoint.  The seafood is incredible, service is good and the decor is - colorful!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant countless times. Love it.  The shrimp a la plancha is so Good. Im addicted."}
{"text":"Mariscos Playa Hermosa was picked for May's International Supper Club UYE and we had a big turnout expected 14 but had around 26 to 30 and I have to say management & servers didn't blink an eye when I kept asking for another chair please.  Excellent customer service!    The parking lot is very very small, maybe can park 8 to 12 cars, but there is plenty of parking on the street, so that what I did, once inside the place is very colorful and inviting.  I ordered the 3 carne asada tacos with beans and rice. They were great street tacos perfect for what I was craving. The beans and rice were ok, over all it was a good dish and with tax included came in under 10 bucks! That's a great deal for dinner!    After everyone was done eating they brought us out 5 different types of cakes/dessert to try, chocolate cake, tres leches cake, coconut cake, cheese cake & flan. I'm a chocolate lovin fool and the chocolate cake was perfect, it was sweet, rich and full of chocolaty goodness, but my favorite I have to say was the Tres Leches Cake, that stuff was amazing! Also the coconut cake was great too!   I defiantly will be coming back to try a few other of their dishes for sure!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!!! Great food and awesome service!!! You must eat here ... The prices are great for fresh sea food."}
{"text":"The interior was very brightly decorated and beautiful service was great people are very friendly unfortunately the food was just mediocre"}
{"text":"I had the cocktail with everything. It's been 6 hours since I last ate and I am still full!! Portions are awesome and the service was great! I will be coming back very soon this place is legit!"}
{"text":"The environment is close knit and warm , authentic music and the waiters are humble and take care of their customers like their own family."}
{"text":"I found this place using Yelp. They have well-made margaritas. The chips come with red and green salsas. The service is really friendly and the food is delicious. I would go back. I recommend the ceviche tostadas. I had the crab enchiladas that were good. The best entree I tried was a fried fish entree."}
{"text":"Well worth the trip to Phoenix if you live elsewhere in the valley. We ordered several items to put'em to the test and everything was delish with the exception of the shrimp cocktail which was flavorless and watery, but the shrimp was good. We're from Chicago where authentic food is hard to compete with but Mariscos Playa Hermosa held its own. Thanks to Yelp we found this great place!"}
{"text":"I love all their seafood and other choices. Free cake with yelp deal. I would definitely recommend this place in Phoenix. Best Mexican food I ever had,  even in Mexico."}
{"text":"We arrived in Phoenix and needed lunch before heading to Flagstaff, so we found this place on Yelp. What a find! It's located not far from the airport so that is really convenient. It's small and parking is limited, but it was raining (!) and so we were able to grab the last parking spot.   Our food was nothing short of stupendous. They start you out with free ceviche on a mini tostado, and it is delicious. I got the enchilada jaiba (with crab) and it was really good, with red chile sauce. The wife got the camaron (shrimp) culichi with green chile sauce. We each ate about half of our meal and then traded because I love green chile and she loves red chile. I must say, I got the better of the trade! The green chile sauce was nothing short of orgasmic; just fantastically deliciously awe-inspiringly good. I could eat that sauce on a shoe and be happy. The rice and beans were also excellent, way above the typical non-descript flavor, and each meal also came with a salad! What a deal. We were so happy that Yelpers turned us on to this place. Whenever I am in Phoenix for whatever reason, I am heading back to this place!"}
{"text":"The best ceviche I've ever had. This place is fantastic; everything is delicious. You seriously can't go wrong with whatever you order. I ate so much it hurt, but I regret nothing! I was having dinner with a self-professed snob of Mexican food, and he was quiet the entire meal - shamelessly stuffing his face.  My server was super helpful and would tell it like it is. She made excellent recommendations and I got to try things I wouldn't normally go out on a limb to try.  I don't live anywhere near this place. I found it based on Yelp ratings; but it is now bookmarked as a destination spot the next time I'm even remotely close."}
{"text":"In my quest for the best Mexican food (somewhere in which the refried beans are not from a can).  I happened upon Mariscos!  It was fabulous and I will return often and work my way through the menu.  I had the camarone culichi, which came with rice, salad and beans.  It was a lot of food, enough to take home for a second meal.  Next time I will try a margarita....it looked very tasty.  The establishment was quaint, it looked very clean and they were very welcoming!"}
{"text":"Last min stop because I was craving Mexican food and I'm glad we stopped by.   1st the bad news- the service wasn't very good. We were seated in the back of the restaurant, all alone, like kids on a time out. And while our waitress was very lovely, I think she forgot about us a lot because service was very slow. The restaurant was slightly busy, but not crazy, so we expected a little more attention. We had to keep leaving our table to ask for water, or drinks, or the check- it was annoying.   Now the good news: the food is excellent. Super yummy and very generous portions. Had the ceviche, fish tacos, and chicken enchiladas- all excellent.   So overall, it was a great meal- but service needs work. Will definitely be back to try again. :)"}
{"text":"Delicious micheladas, amazing hospitality. Amazing food. Everything tastes so fresh! Servers are very attentive and informative. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"1st time at this restaurant and we will definitely be back! Everything was amazing! Great service + great food = Return visits"}
{"text":"Awesome food, ceviche, shrimp cocktail everything! Sometimes they are crowded and super busy but bring you out a free ceviche tostada to hold you over. Great Place"}
{"text":"Had a great meal here with great friends. I read the reviews and couldn't wait to go in. We started with the Mariscos frio, which we never got a picture of because we all dug in so fast. I had the shrimp and calamari in garlic sauce. Everyone's dishes were fantastic. I can't wait for lunch tomorrow. Leftovers are waiting. I will be going back!!!"}
{"text":"Went with the family for something new. Ordered the house special Molcajete, all I can say is WOW.  It had shrimp, octopus tomatillo sauce, beef, chicken and fried fish. Every food group you could possibly imagine! :)  We go the green sauce, the red sauce is a LOT spicier than I expected. If you want delicious Mexican food you can't beat Moriscos Play Hermosa. Don't be afraid of the location, my wife and I were a bit worried as it does seem like it's in the middle of nowhere and in a shadier area but well worth it!.  Make sure to check is as well and get that free slice of cake (we grabbed the coconut one mmmm)."}
{"text":"Great customer service and every food item was made from scratch. This is my 2nd time here. I loved it the 1st time but decided not to post until I was sure it deserved 5 stars. My 2nd visit was even better."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this gem by accident and we are so glad we did.  The food was exceptional and the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"Insanely delicious.  I don't know how else to describe my dinner there.  My husband and I were in Phoenix for a long weekend and wanted some good Mexican food.  (Thank you, fellow Yelpers, for pointing me towards Mariscos Playa Hermosa.)  This adorable little restaurant looks like absolutely nothing from the outside- just a plain looking building with a sign.  The inside, though, is cute and definitely has an authentic Mexican feel.  Upon entering the restaurant, we were warmly greeted and seated. Within a few minutes, we were offered beers and tortilla chips.  We opted for guacamole to compliment our tortillas, the former of which I was suspicious at first because of the seemingly runny consistency.  Boy, was I wrong - the guac was tangy and full of flavor. I would love to have their recipe!      Based on other review, we opted for the molcajete for our main curse.  It. Was. Off. The. Hook.  It arrived in a medium-sized, deep bowl, filled half-way with a delicious spicy cheesy gray.  Along the sides of the bowl are shrimp, chicken, beef and scallops.  We just kind of pushed all the meats into the sauce and then dug in.  And while this dish is meant to serve up to 4 persons, we totally killed it and finished every bite.  (Disclaimer:  I'm a small person and really don't eat that much.... The molcajete was JUST THAT GOOD.)    The next time I'm in Phoenix, I'll make sure to return to Mariscos!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The food and service were impeccable. A note: when something on the menu says hot, they mean HOT! My husbasnd and I had the molcajete a la diabla for 2 ($33) and we went through so many napkin wiping our eyes and noses. Neither of us are woosies when it comes to heat either. I had a michilada and my husband had a house margarita, both delicious (and strong). I'd love to have more of the device next time, also looking forward to trying the shrimp cocktail. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican seafood in Phoenix. Everything on the menu is delicious and well worth the price. If you're a first-timer fry the fish tacos w/cheese, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First visit here and we will be back! The place is so fun and bright, fast service. Chips and salsas hit the spot and the complimentary toastada got us ready for our main course. The molcajete for two with green sauce was so good we didn't need to add any extra sauce or spices, although if you like it hot I'm sure you could add some picante sauce. There was plenty of picante sauce options to choose from on the table. Fast and friendly service, the waitress helped us select what we ordered and she didn't steer us wrong. Can't wait for our next visit!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, reasonable priced and the atmosphere was relaxed. The waitress was courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"I was looking for mariscos and drove all the way from Scottsdale to come here. I was thoroughly impressed! The food tasted like what I would expect homemade Mexican seafood to taste like. I had shrimp in garlic sauce and fish ceviche. I'll be coming back as soon as possible."}
{"text":"This place is da bomb. Their Michelada is so tasty, it had me smacking my lips. The server was great, nice Mexican vibe to the whole restaurant, for sure would be a killer date night. I suggest the 7 Mares Stew, it's big enough to share. Stop reading and start driving, you've got some sea food to nom nom."}
{"text":"Omg first time here and I was NOT disappointed. I'm from San Diego so I do compare all mariscos. I always am on a hunt for a good mariscos when i travel and this place was def was comparable to San Diego. Everything we had was delicious. Service was great. Pricing wasn't to bad. It's seafood so it's not cheap. I was very content and will come back when I'm in AZ again."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and food! We ordered tostadas, tacos, margaritas and micheladas, and were not disappointed. Fish tasted fresh and Barbados flavorful. Place was also very baby-/family-friendly. Our new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"This would be three and a half but you can not do that.  A rough looking sort of neighborhood but a nice and welcoming environment once you get inside.  Great menu you with items you do not see in most mexican restaurants.  Not cheap but a good quality and quantity.  Would recommend it."}
{"text":"We have a lot of cheap Mexican food options in the valley, but this place is legit.   A clean little hole in the wall joint with outstanding service, killer food and all the details done right.   When I want real authentic Mexican food, I don't want to eat it out of a strip mall.   I want the whole experience.    The carne asada came with sauteed onions and home made tortillas.  The crab in my wifes seafood enchilada had real crab in it (most places uses imitation crab).   The chips and salsa had home made chips, and the salsa had a couple of options, and was hot and flavorful.   The chicken tacos were fresh and the whole deal was 100% on point.   I can't speak spanish, but I know home made food when I see it.     Even the decorations:   The chairs themselves were full of color and straight from Mexico.     We ate, enjoyed each others company and the waitress even comped us with some kind of free salmon corn tostada things for what clearly appeared to be for their new gringo customers.   They were delicious.   The food, the service, the everything:  I think I love you guys.  Hell yes... Ill be back."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. The authentic feel to it, the food, the ambiance is amazing. Definitely one of my go to places for mariscos!!! You can't go wrong coming here. Although the area is a little sketchy it's a good place to eat and unwind!! Trust me!!!"}
{"text":"Close to the airport and they offer a complimentary fish tostada. The grilled fish tacos are really delicious. I will come back next time I am in AZ!"}
{"text":"OK, mi madre is not prone to going out to eat unless you say the word, \"seafood\" to her. However, my aunt and I read some reviews and used our best cajoling to get her out of her mu mu and into the car to visit this little restaurant just down the way from Ranch Market.   When we walked in, I was excited by the colors and festive feel that they have. We were greeted by the owner who is very attentive, and seated straight away. Having read the Yelp! reviews, I knew I was going to aim for the camarones culichi, and gazed at their vast options anyhow. I consider myself pretty seafood savvy! They have such an array of fish dishes that I long to try! Especially their fish soup... it looked amazing. However, I stuck to my trusted reviews and ordered the camarones culichi, my mother ordered the garlic shrimp, and my aunt ordered the fried fish filet.   I know they said not to fill up on the chips and salsa-- but that green salsa made me so happy, I think I will order a pint to take home next time I go. Trust me.   First, they brought by little ceviche tostadas to try-- I was so excited that the fish tasted so fresh and delightful. Also, free ceviche? I have no idea if they do this all the time, but what a deal! It had a chipotle and citrus flavor immersed in it and was light, but very satisfying.   The culichi sauce is full of tomatillo, cilantro, garlic, and lime-- however, their combination is so magical, I cannot express it without salivating. The shrimp are cooked in the sauce and brought out separate from the salad, beans, and rice, and they have the same amazing taste. I will seriously write a poem for how that sauce tastes-- and they give you plenty of fresh tortillas that I wrapped the beans and rice with and dipped in that sauce to ensure I got every last drop. You could taste the freshness of the fish even in the fried fish, which was seasoned and fried to perfection. The \"exquisite salad\" that they offer with every meal really is exquisite, while simple and melds to the meals well since there isn't a strong dressing on it.   The point is, we left so amazingly joyful and thanked the owner about ten times. I don't know how I am expected to go to another restaurant for some time..."}
{"text":"My go to spot for a nice cold brew or yummy michelada! The micheladas are up there on my list of favorite places to grab a michelada! The waitstaff is attentive and friendly. Tried the shrimp quesadilla, which was a healthy portion that was of shareable size. Will continue to come here!"}
{"text":"This is definitely your place for Micheladas and Mariscos   The food is great! You will not be disappointed with their food or drinks.    The reason for the 3 star review is the service is very hit or miss.  I still go a couple times a month for my fix."}
{"text":"Excellent taste and service. Was craving Mexican style seafood and found this place.  Their menu is extensive, however they also have it sectioned out, in case someone in your party wants something other than seafood.  We ordered the shrimp ceviche and the aguachiles. They tasted fresh and spicy. My hubby ordered the chicken enchiladas and they were really good.  The price for the food portion is a little on the steep side, but will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST mariscos I've had in the states. Nothing compares to Mexico. I've been to plenty of mariscos places and this one is hands down the best ever. You definitely get what you're paying for. Their complimentary chips and salsas are tasty. They also throw in a complimentary tostada de ceviche. Not sure about the $4 side of avocado but besides that I recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: My margarita was perfect and I can't say for sure if that influenced my review of the food :)  Saw this place on \"Check Please, Arizona\" on channel 8 and was so excited to try it.  And wow, we were not disappointed at all!  In fact, the food far exceeded our expectations!    We had the molcajete with green sauce.  It's basically a giant hot lava bowl full of deliciousness and even though 3 of us couldn't finish all of it, I was still sad when I couldn't cram any more of it in my face.  We also shared a fish fillet with octopus and shrimp in a mushroom cream sauce.  It was also very good, but the star of the show was definitely the green sauce in that molcajete.  We are going back next weekend and looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"awesome ceviche that was fresh and full of good veggies and fish, she had tacos that were also good , great mariachi played requests all night payed by the restaurant and only accepted tips, reasonably priced all around,"}
{"text":"I drive from Gilbert to this place every week! It has to be my favorite mariscos! The staff is nice and the food is so good!! Not to mention you get complimentary fish ceviche tostada / chips salsa while waiting for your food. Also the shrimp ceviche is my favorite and I would definitely try the micheladas"}
{"text":"I love this place. It gets pretty busy so be prepared to wait if so since it is small but we have been there at least 5 times in the past 2 yrs and have had a great experience every time. I love love their ceviche very flavorful. Everythong we have tasted has been good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best Mexican I ever tasted, every dishes are super, the price and service are wonderful"}
{"text":"As a visitor in Phoenix we went with highest rated and nearby place.  Easy parking, loved the cute doorbell and liked it was full with a range of folks from couples to families.  I wish I had gone with the jug of margarita because YUM!  Food was fresh and tasty.  We had fish tacos, enchiladas, and a side of guacamole, would do again."}
{"text":"Highly recommend ceviche pescado, it was amazing! The drinks are really impressive, had the mango Diablo and I downed it because it was so good. The customer service does not match the food... Only downside was the waitress with glasses that we had did not smile once or even looked like she wanted to be there. Made things a little uncomfortable."}
{"text":"The food and service was excellent. Our waitress Sol was great. We did the \"Check in\" on yelp and got a delicious piece of chocolate cake. Micheladas also perfect.  If you are looking for a Mexican/Seafood restaurant definitely try Mariscos Playa Hermosa ."}
{"text":"Here in town from Los Angeles. We yelped a seafood restaurant. Wow far beyond what we expected. Service was amazing and food was delicious. Our waitress Karen was absolutely amazing. She was so attentive . If ever visiting again we definitely will be back! A+ all the way around!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for Mexican seafood, I'd say MPH gets the nod over other joints such as Acapulco Bay (S. Scottsdale), San Carlos Bay (CenPho), or San Diego Bay (Guadeloupe).  The place has a bit of a rep for crab enchiladas (there was a blurb in Gourmet a few years ago), but they may be one of the more bland things on the menu.   I'm going to second the idea that the shrimp dishes are a great way to fall for this place on the first visit. The camarones culichi are awesome, with a tomatillo sauce that should be distilled into bath salts. Snapper veracruz is delicious if you're looking to test one of the more typical preparations.   Oh -- This place isn't really that parking-sketchy (especially if you've experienced the Ranch Market demo derby up the street) and they have their own lot right in front."}
{"text":"Good food, and close to PHX airport, so you can eat without being rushed.  Drinks are super bright and delish!  The decor is super upbeat and nice, and so are the waitstaff.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of five is that there was an overabundance of pork and seafood options, and not many chicken dishes (or any dish with molé).    Would go back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite marisco place in town. The staff is friendly and always warm and welcoming. The molcajetete a la diabla  is my favorite, nice and spicy. And of course I cannot miss my Cardinals so I love that I can watch the game from almost every seat in the house!  Only one downside, the exhaust system may not be the best because you will smell like the spices and cooking aromas of what is cooked there. So have the Febreeze ready for your clothes!"}
{"text":"Saw the Mariscos Playa Hermosa menu photo layout in the Phoenix Mexican Food Guide (Mexican Seafood) section and we had to try it. It's almost 30 miles one way and I would do the drive a couple times a week for the food, service and friendliness We were taken care of from the time we entered right up to leaving. The \"on the house\" appetizers are are excellent. I like the red and my wife liked the green so much she had it put in our take home. We shared the Molcajete Catiente Mix and had enough take home for a late dinner. My beans and rice were the first empty plate and I know I had two loaded plates from the bubbling Mix bowl. The Mix sauce was so good I put it on my rice and could have made a meal from just that and the beans. I had a little trouble getting Yelp to come up,on my cell, but they had already taken our order for the complimentary \"Yelp  cake\". If you haven't tried a Tres Leche Cake you will want to make sure and order a slice here. My wife's chocolate cake was top notch too.  If you haven't read the Phoenix Mexican Food Guide (Mexican Seafood) article you want know how to get the cake. Here's a link to the restaurant: http://mariscosplayahermosa.com/reviews.htm and a link to the Phoenix Food Guide magazine: http://www.phoenixmag.com"}
{"text":"Authentic cuisine that is so wonderful and delicious. Good drinks and a vibrant setting. Great for families and dates. Just remember it closes at 9 pm. Wait staff is great."}
{"text":"I have forever been put off from trying mexican seafood. I am not sure why really.  Just something always tells me, don't risk it, you are too young!  So i finally did not listen to my gut feeling and I am glad i didn't. We got their special stone bowl with mocalate...I am 100% i spelled that wrong, there was different meat in it and it was delicious.... I am actually drooling thinking of this dish again.   Yes I will be back and I might just order that again, because it was so good. (i am sure there other items are good too).  I would pass on desserts though."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Colorful atmosphere. Great drinks. Parking may or may not be problematic.  Go!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were great! Complimentary ceviche tostada was very tasty and fish was fresh."}
{"text":"I moved to Phoenix 8 years ago and never gave this place a try. I decided to go in yesterday and give it a shot. Living in Arizona it is really hard to find excellent seafood but this place was incredible!!! The service was perfect and the staff was very attentive. The atmosphere was pleasant and it was packed with people which means good food. I think i will be coming back a few times a month. Keep up the great work guys and the quality of the food is perfect."}
{"text":"Hola, yep this is the place to be if you are looking for authentic Mexican dishes. Lots of seafood choices but also a large variety of chicken and beef. I had the molcajete for 3 with Diablo salsa. Simply AMAZING, very easy the salsa, hot hot spicy as I love it. The margaritas were a bit on the watery side. Service is good and a great interior decor. Dolt like I was back in Mexico. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"hmmm I must say I was a little disappointed after driving 45 minutes to eat here. I saw it reviewed on a popular local TV Show and it looked awesome so decided to give it a try.  First the parking lot was really small/tight so that made it a challenge. The place was very much smaller inside than it looked on TV as well. Your table chair up against another tables chair small. You couldn't easily get in and out without hitting other diners.  As far as service they were nice enough but after taking our order we didn't see our server very often. Had to ask for menus and after we received our food we had to ask for silverware. It was said on the show everyone get a small sample of the ceviche. We did not. We did get chips and salsa as well as a tomatillo green sauce. While not bad the chips and sales was not that good either. They did not give small plates or anything so the chip went into the sauce then straight to your mouth. Kind of sloppy.  For an app we had seafood cocktail. It was large and pretty good with lots of different kind of shrimp, octopus, fish etc. They didn't scrimp on the seafood but at $18.00 each I would hope not! It was served with saltines which I also thought is kind of weird for a Mexican restaurant.  For entrees we had a spicy shrimp dish and crab enchiladas. The spicy shrimp was good. Smothered in a red sauce it was a little hard to eat since they left the tail shell on and it was hard to remove and eat because it was smothered in the sauce. Not sure how you were expected to pull it off?  The crab enchiladas were not good to me at all and had a weird smell. I only ate two bites and was done. Overall damage approached $70 for two people and I left hungry. I love Mexican food i guess just not Mexican seafood."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great food good ambience. It was my Bday and the mariachi played me some songs!"}
{"text":"Excellent.  I was very impressed with the selection and food quality.  In fact, I will go back just for the authentic and fresh salsa.  If you are looking for Mexican food with quality seafood, this is the place.  They have an informal dinning area; although the place doesn't look like much from the outside, the inside is pretty decent.  The staff was friendly.  They also have a full service bar.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"We come here about once every month or so and love it here. I like to order the molcajete, which is basically a huge pot filled with meat and seafood, in their \"Diabla\" sauce. It is spicy as heck, but I can't stop eating it! It's my favorite sauce by far. The food is always fresh, as well as the veggies they serve on the side. The staff are all friendly and very attentive to you. The atmosphere is very chill, with different cumbias playing softly in the background and a soccer game always on TV. They just recently remodeled and now there's way more seating, so wait times are cut in half. I love Playa Hermosa and am a loyal regular. Five out of five stars."}
{"text":"This place is the best Mexican seafood I've found in Phoenix! they bring complimentary shrimp ceviche tostadas that are superb! The Camarones Culichi and Molcajete Caliente, one of their specialty dishes,  If you go for lunch and, be sure to ask for the lunch portions, which are half the price listed on the menu! The atmosphere is wonderfully festive, much nicer than you'd expect from the outside, and the service is prompt and friendly. There's good reason for the numerous plaques and articles of praise adorning the walls."}
{"text":"Awesome and authentic a must-visit. Mariachi band was on point. Get the house special with diablo sauce."}
{"text":"Tried this place out based on Yelp reviews ! Was not disappointed ! It was delicious ! Staff was friendly and the portions were big! I will come back"}
{"text":"I can finally say I have had some great seafood in Phoenix, AZ. The seafood was fresh and really good. They where so excited to it was our first time there. The waitress Brenda was Awesome she was so helpful and friendly. She check on us several time to see if everything was good and if we needed anything.   I recommend this place to anyone in Arizona who lives or visiting Arizona and you want some good seafood come here."}
{"text":"Love this place! Molcajete was outstanding although I wish they put a little more squid in the green sauce. Great chips, solid ceviche, amazing horchata! Authentic interior with bright colors, festive chairs and tables, and several televisions for watching sports or whatever."}
{"text":"I love this place. My dad and I went here about 5 months ago and I have been here almost a dozen times since. I love the fish tacos. The place seems clean and the help is really friendly. They also have this green salsa that they bring out with the chips right at first that is really good! The surrounding area is rough but this is good!"}
{"text":"Excellent food & friendly service! We will definitely be back! The guac is amazing by the way, definitely a must try starter."}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the restaurant's exterior and surrounding area, because the Mexican seafood here is very good, the service is pleasant and prompt, the servings are very large and the prices are extremely affordable. What more can I say? If you want a lot of very flavorful Mexican seafood at a great price that is backed by good service, then this is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"Nothing to brag about here but the decor.Ive had better Mexican seafood in food trucks."}
{"text":"Went here today based on great reviews. Ordered the fish tacos - the fish meat had a lot of grey pieces which I tried to pull out of each taco. I began feeling sick within an hour after leaving. I will not be visiting this restaurant again any time soon."}
{"text":"BEST MEXICAN FOOD EVER.  Do not even look at the menu, people. Just order a Dos Equis and the Molcajete Caliente with verde sauce.   My boyfriend and I found this place on the Yelp app, like most eateries we visited while in Phoenix. I cannot express how happy this place made us. We loved the restaurant, the service and the food so much that we actually came back and ate there again before heading to the airport.  The Molcajete Caliente is $22 for two people. You each get your own ceviche tostada and plate of rice, beans and salad (all delicious). They also bring a warmer with corn or flour tortillas. But the main event... a volcanic-like cast iron cauldron (a molcajete) teeming with bubbling green sauce with various kinds of grilled meats and seafood hanging around the outside. The smell alone will bring you halfway to heaven, but ZOMG, taste explosion! SO GOOD.   It comes with two breaded fish filets, two pieces of grilled steak, two of chicken and four big shrimp. Plus, there are little chunks of octopus in the sauce itself. If I had to choose a favorite, it would be the fish (or the seafood in general), but every bite of everything was honestly amazing. It may be the best sauce I've ever eaten.   The service was superb both visits---super friendly, fast and helpful. The server was the one who recommended the molcajete in the first place, actually. The prices are almost unbelievable ($22 for a VOLCANO OF FOOD??).   The restaurant itself is really clean and full ceramic tiles and colorful artwork. Some reviewers have commented about the dodgy location. The neighborhood seemed fine to me, though I don't live in Phoenix so I could be mistaken. It's mostly residential, but well-worth making a special trip (like, every single day) for this food!  Note: If you're planning on ordering the ceviche as an appetizer, just be aware that you might not get your house ceviche tostadas. We didn't get ours the second visit because my boyfriend insisted on getting a full order of ceviche. He was hoping they would bring both (because he's insane and would eat an ocean full of ceviche if left on his own), but they didn't."}
{"text":"great customer service. We reached just before closing ( 8pm on a weekday) and we were the only customers there but still got great service. The la diabla fish fillet in a red sauce and Camarones culichi were both very good. The sauce with the fish filet was yummmm. The tortillas were made fresh and just melted in the mouth. I would def. come here when I am in the area!!"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to eating here, however they seated us in what looked like a cell room with no windows and there was a party of fifteen and half of them were toddlers. That room should of only been for that party, not stick us four in with them. Now for the food, the shrimp and the fish were old not fresh at all. The salsa was like water with added spices and the rice was bland. The seven seas soup was mostly tilapia fish and one half of crab leg and two shrimp for $16. We liked the chairs and tables because they were colorful fish and ocean like. The waitress was nice but was too busy with the party table. Drove 40 minutes with our children back and forth to eat fresh seafood and were disappointed. I checked in and you are supposed to have a choice of cake, but the waitress told me that the only choice I had was chocolate or coconut, but I really wanted flan."}
{"text":"Easily 4.5 stars but I'm rounding it up to 5 just necause of the Micheladas that are pretty bland. ...but the food? A perfect 10. I came with family, a big crowd and everyone got something different and it all looks so delicious. I got the three breaded shrimp tacos and they were off the hook. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Have been coming her for years. Went back about 4 months ago after a long break away and it was still as good and fresh as ever. The little marisco joint is colorful, clean, and the staff is friendly. The chips and green salsa are phenomenal and the little ceviche tostada they bring to each customer before there main dish is served, is a lovely touch. Go!....go now!.....you will be be disappointed ;)"}
{"text":"First time here, excellent ambient, great food and great service. I had a 7 mares mariscos plate. It was bomb! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"The most amazing fish. I take all my colleagues in from out of town. Moriscos is an amazing \"hole in the wall\" secret. The fish smothered with plablano pepper is my favorite. An absolute winner."}
{"text":"The decor here is very \"interesting\". I would say it could be classified as Hollywood Mexican meet kitsch. But who really cares about that what is important is that the food is solid. I had shrimp  fajitas and they were delicious. I also drank the Jamaica , which is hibiscus tea, and it was really tasty. I can't really say anything bad about this place and I don't think that the two colleagues visiting with me could either unless you're offended by kitschy decor. Do understand that this is not a high-end surf and turf type of fish restaurant, it is a fairly authentic Mexican seafood place"}
{"text":"Mariscos Playa Hermosa is kind of in the, shall we say, less savory area of town, but don't let that deter you from trying it out! The outside pretty much looks like a crummy box but the inside is super colorful and lavishly decorated. I wasn't sure what to expect but the food sufficiently impressed me.  You get two salsas with a basket of chips--both of which are super delicious. The avocado salsa was tasty and not super watered-down like at some places. The red one, which is semi-spicy, is very tasty. I don't even know how to describe it. It was just so.... TASTY.  We received some salmon (I think?) ceviche on a crispy tortilla with our meals. Very yummy and the veggies in it tasted fresh. I ordered the enchiladas de jaiba and the others ordered fish tacos. Both were good although I think I liked the fish tacos better than my enchiladas. I thought the fish was really good and light. I noticed the rice seemed to be made with those frozen mixed veggies you get at the supermarket, which I thought was kind of funny, but it still tasted good so I guess it didn't matter.  Service was very prompt even though the server wasn't particularly engaging. I actually prefer my service to be this way, so if you prefer a waiter/waitress that likes to make conversation, then maybe this isn't the place for you. Interior of the restaurant looked relatively clean.  I definitely recommend Mariscos Playa Hermosa. Don't be scared of the rundown appearance of the area! I cannot speak on the authenticity of the food but at least it was yummy."}
{"text":"Aaah the unassuming, small restaurant in a questionable part of town. I should know these happen to be some of the BEST places for a meal.   We decided on this place after my son did a little research on Mariscos Restaurants in the area. It was in celebration of my hubs \"26th\" birthday and his craving for Mariscos.   Upon pulling up to the restaurant we gave each other questionable look due  to the size of the restaurant and neighborhood, but it quickly discipitated upon entrance. Beautifuuul, colorful decor. Very clean and plenty of seating with a full bar. We chose seats and our waitress came over for our drink order. In addition to the traditional chips and salsa we were also brought ceviche tostadas.. ON THE HOUSE. I personally liked both salsas and the chips were thin and crispy and fresh. Hubs wasn't feeling either the red or green salsa.  I ordered the fish tacos - FABULOUS. I was expecting fried fish and cream sauce but received fresh grilled fish with a sprinkling of cheese. I was a liitle doubtful but with my first bit I was in love. Sooooo good and so flavorful without the guilt that comes with eating fried food. The rice is not a tomato based rice, flavorful nonetheless, white with veggies. Very good. The beans were also very good, reminded me of grandmas.  We all tasted each others food and there was not one thing I didn't love. My daughter got the Shrimp Ranchera.. fresh, delicious shrimp and veggies in a light, lemony sauce. My son got the Molcajete Caliente.. GREAT dish to share. The meat, and the fish were the BEST. The sauce was nice and smokey and had just a full great flavor to it. Hubs got a seafood cocktail depsite my coaxing into getting a pescado frito. I wanted a taste :/ His cocktail was very good despite them using canned clams rather than fresh.   This has quickly become my new favorite Mariscos spot in AZ. Can't wait to visit again and try some of the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Enjoyable experience!  Never expected to find this little gem in downtown, but so glad I did.  I like my margaritas strong and flavorful and they did not disappoint.  Our seafood entrées were delicious. Ambience is fun, colorful. The mariachis were unexpexted and much enjoyed! Service was attentive. The complimentary ceviche tostada was the icing on the cake. Definitely will be back.  If only they offered brunch I'd give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I have had in a while!  The service was excellent and the mariachis definitely added to the experience."}
{"text":"I'm in love. The festive décor charmed me the second I walked in the door. We sat down and were immediately greeting by a sweet waitress carrying a basket of chips. The chips were light and fresh and came with two salsas, a red and a green avocado salsa.  We ordered: Camarones aguachile hot drowned shrimp, Camarones culichi shrimps in a green sauce,tomatill & cilantro, rezongue enchiladas crab enchiladas in a red sauce. I also ordered a club soda and when the waitress asked if I wanted it prepared mexi style I said yes. What she brought back was a delicious mix of club soda, salt and muddled lime. It's my new favorite drink.   We patiently waited for our meal and remarked on the little mermaid scene in front of us. I almost expected the crustaceans to come to life and start playing music.  Then to our surprise little fish tostadas were dropped on our table. What a nice touch! The dishes were excellent, all were paired with homemade tortillas, beans and white rice with vegetables.  The camarones culichi was my favorite.  Fresh seafood, fun atmosphere, great service."}
{"text":"Im here on a business trip from California and default to Yelp as hunger savior. I found Mariscos Playa Hermosa based off my location and yelp reviews.   I walked in and there were only 4 other people eating,  then again it was only 6pm. I was greeted by a friendly gal.  I picked my own seat and immediately was offered a drink.  I got agua de  Jamaica which was perfect not too sweet. I was brought chips and salsa a few minutes later. There were 2 salsas, an avocado salsa and a red salsa. The avocado one was perfect,  the red was great but OH EM GEE my mouth was on fire. I love hot sauce, but this for sure was blazing!    I really wanted shrimp and asked for recommendations.  I was recommended the bacon wrapped shrimp but decided not too because I'd feel guilty of it being too fatty. I then was recommended the A ala diabla shrimp. I usually love spicy shrimp, but at this point my mouth was on fire from the salsa.....sooo i got it anyway. Why not?     My plate arrived with about 6 shrimp and tons of sauce with rice beans and sode salad.  The beans and rice were great, but holy moly the shrimp were BLAZING SPICY holy moly. They were still good.  Overall, the service and food was great. I will def come back on my next visit."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place, especially on a Friday night when the Mariachi's are there.  I get the same plate every time and never have any complaints - Grilled Fish Culichi!  Best Micheladas in town too!  BTW, check in on Yelp and you get a FREE slice of cake!"}
{"text":"Food was great we also received a free slice of chocolate cake upon check in. Kid menu was small. Didn't care for the salsa they served with this chips. Atmosphere was intresting. The waitresses about 4 or 5 at a time were seated at a table wrapping silverware I thought that looked tacky and should have been done in the back of the house. Prices were fair. 13.9o to 16.99 for an entree. 3 stars"}
{"text":"My favorite in Phoenix, the food is fresh and tasty. My husband and I like to treat ourselves and indulge here and there and when my friend told me about this place, i had to go try it out for myself.  We started out with the ceviche yum, they have shrimp and fish, but we went with the order of fish ceviche since my husband is allergic to shrimp. We loved every bite, it comes with tostadas on the side and you can make your own.  We shared the Molcajete, holy smokes! was sooo good. it had alittle bit of everything. You can choose to have a spicy sauce or a mild green sauce we went the the mild green sauce and my husband loved it so much he took the remaining sauce to go.   We're not big drinkers but they have several special drinks i saw walking by that looked very appetizing, I think i will take have to come back with my girlfriends for happy hour. If you're still hungry, ask for the flan, the waitress let us know they make it in house, so I had to taste it out. You can tell its home made. I might even go back to take some to go next time. We're excited to find this place and look forward to try the rest of plates."}
{"text":"Worst place ever, orchatas my friends and I ordered were warm, the mariscos were also warm and watered down. Terrible servers. As soon as we got our food they brought out the bill.  Never coming here again."}
{"text":"This place is cute.  Cute!  Tables and chairs are festively colorful and it really brings out the cheer.  You won't need to order appetizers because you'll get yummy chips and salsas (red and green) and a small tortilla with ceviche.  Can't remember what fish platter we had because the menu is plentiful long, but it was a white fish served with veggies mixed in with rice.  Very delicate and pleasing.    And how, the molcajete!  Requested the waiter if we could have it served without red meat or poultry, so he brought one with seafood only.  Sizzling hot, tasty, filling.  Took home leftovers and ordered a whole fried fish to go as well."}
{"text":"We ordered shrimp in green sauce and chicken flautas. Both the shrimp and chicken were overcooked. The sides were average- nothing too special. What gives this place 3 stars was the fish I tasted from a friend's plate. It was half green sauce and half red sauce...and amazing. I'd return just for that fish. The restaurant has a fun atmosphere and is very colorful.  Service was also fairly good as we with a huge group."}
{"text":"I walked here from the Sheraton after dark - don't do this! Once inside - I was in an oasis of great food and margerhitas. The atmosphere is festive with a colorful fish motif like I've experienced in Mexico.  The tortilla chips were fresh made as we're the tortillas that came with my meal. A complimentary ceviche was provided. I had the fish filet with shrimp and octopus in mushroom sauce. The plate was huge with sides of salad, rice, and beans. The food was delicious. I was alone so my review can only consider one visit and one dish - but, I've been trying to minimize calories yet cleaned the plate.  Another great seafood dinner in Phoenix - who'd have thunk it. Mission accomplished."}
{"text":"It actually has been a year since I visited and it was great! I went with a party of 7 and we tried and shared a little of everything. It can be pricey but then again it is seafood. It satisfied my craving for mariscos."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for the amount of seafood you get. Don't think I'll be going back to this spot."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the location, this place would have been 5.  The shrimp dishes are absolutely wonderful, the service is great and decor is certainly interesting. I will be back. Only wish it was closer to my usual haunts"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican restaurant. The warm chips & quac were good. I had the breaded shrimp platter, my partner had the whole fish. The said it was talapia but it was kinda hard to tell! The fish was very good, however. My shrimp platter was just average."}
{"text":"Drove almost an hour to come here and will never come back.   I took my mom here because of the rating and for her birthday. As soon as you walk in you'll see frames and frames of how they were on the newspaper. The place is cute and We were greeted by friendly staff members as soon as we walked in.  We went ahead and ordered their shrimp cocktail, shrimp tostada and oysters. When the oysters came out, right off the bat we knew it wasn't fresh. My mom ate one oyster and immediately said \"I'm not going to eat anymore\" and had a disgusted look on her face. She said when she swallowed it it wasn't cold but tasted warm so I touched one of them and she was right. We told the waitress and she got the manager. He stuck his thumb in one of them and said \"it's cold\" then says \"do you guys still want it?\" We told him \"no\". After that incident my moms cocktail came out and I had a bite from it. That was also warm and so I told my mom to put ice in it from her water. The only thing that was good was my little dish. It had a lot of chopped up shrimp and pico de gallo on top of a tostada.   Man I'm surprised of their ratings.. I've had better Mexican food elsewhere."}
{"text":"This a very good restaurant. We ate Molcajete and choriqueso and it was amazing.  The service was extremely good and the mariachi music was the best."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. They're seafood is always fresh which is something I've had trouble finding. The Molcajete dish is one of my favorites. The place is very clean and the servers always very friendly."}
{"text":"Anytime I'm in Phoenix I try to make a trip to MPH. I've brought friends and relatives who in turn have brought other friends. No one has ever had anything but good things to say about their meals.  The food here is the real deal and made with a lot of love. Where else do you get peas, carrots and green beans in your rice (unless your Mom made it). You get plenty of chips, fresh made salsa and complimentary ceviche tostada with your entree. My sister who will not eat Sushi even enjoyed her ceviche. I've ordered it to go many times.    My favorite is the Pescado Ala Talla (pronounced Taiya). If you're on a diet, skip it. But if you love fresh, lightly fried fish with a wonderful white sauce that has mushrooms, shrimp and octopus, then this dish is for you! Portions are very generous. The octopus is tender and cooked to perfection, never rubbery. Sorry, I was hungry and forgot to take a photo. You will have to try for yourself.  I keep meaning to try the shrimp cocktail which looks like a Bloody Mary with shrimp but never have room for it. Next time...  The moon and stars would have to be out of alignment for you to have a bad experience at MPH. Wait staff is very friendly and accommodating every single visit. Often times I come alone and never treated any different than a larger party. They know how to run a restaurant!  Even tho I was stuffed I had a bite of the carrot cake. Delish!!!"}
{"text":"Im only giving 1 star because I can't give 0 stars. We come here often and have never been treated the way we were treated tonight. We got there at 8:30pm, waited for 20 minutes, we were never acknowledged, then at 8:50pm the gentleman with the glasses walks over to give another waiting customer their to go order and on his way back to the kitchen stops and tells us that he doesn't think there's room for us and they close at 9...basically telling us to leave. We are extremely disappointed because we really enjoyed this place. Please coach your staff on the proper way to treat paying customers."}
{"text":"Great location, sea food is fresh, I enjoy the end of the week.  Garlic Shrimp dish blew me away.  One of those places when you finally eat there you were thinking why it took so long.  Real Food is here, Look for their three locations in the Valley"}
{"text":"This is the best place for real authentic Mexican food. Not a fancy place but the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love it, but couldn't.  The food was good, but it didn't pop.  I had the garlic shrimp which had some nice flavor, but it wasn't unique and it didn't speak to me.  The guacamole was good.  The shrimp in garlic sauce was pretty good.  Service was solid.  I might need to come back because the menu was extensive and it could only take one or two excellent items to change my mind on the place."}
{"text":"We went to this place based on the yelp reviews and it did not disappoint. Portions are huge, but delicious."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to this location. The first time I did not bother with a review however, I must speak up. This place is delicious. My girlfriend and I stopped in for a quick, light bite in between programs. I had the shrimp cocktail with avocado and she enjoyed a fish tostada. Both were delicious and quite filling. The service was timely and our server was friendly and attentive. Great food, great service you can't beat that."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  I have had fish tacos all over the country and further.  These were the best ever.  Just happened to pick this place out of a app and so happy I did.  The atmosphere is awesome. Middle of the work day so couldn't try their drinks but now wishing I would have.  Service is awesome too.  We will be back again for sure.  Don't forget to get the guacamole too.  Love the pico."}
{"text":"So good, MX coke, the pescado frita es  Muy sabroso!! They even gave each person at our table a free ceviche tostada. Will be back A.S.A.P."}
{"text":"Yum!! Everything here is delicious!! 1 star less because it's sadly a little too pricey :/ But you must try the molcajete here!!"}
{"text":"Once upon a time, a guy selling Mexican food out of his van at my workplace sold me on the perfection of ceviche on my palate. Ever since changing jobs, I've search wide and far for the same perfect mixture of tomatoes, cilantro, lime and shrimp to no avail. Besides stalking the Mexican food van at my old job, I think this restaurant has come the closest to that perfection I first tasted in ceviche.  Besides their great selection of seafood (I haven't order a bad dish yet), their margarita is one of the best."}
{"text":"Magnifico!  Great little place tucked away in a semi-residential area of town.  Felt like I was part of the family after being seated.  Bright cheerful atmosphere like a fiesta!  Food was very flavoful even the white rice.  Crab enchiladas full of white crab meat and smothered in your choice of red or green sauce.  Salsa you get red (Spicy) and green (mild) with chips and I got a complimentary Cerviche.  The red salsa had a nice smoky flavor and just the right kick of heat.  Can't wait to try other dishes when I return to Phoenix in a couple of weeks!"}
{"text":"A-MA-ZING. LOVED the complimentary ceviche! we ordered the fish taco platter (5 stars) and burrito (3 stars, this is a SEAFOOD place folks). i would come here again when i visit phx next time. it's only 4 ish miles from the airport and there's a gas station right next to the restaurant! we filled up our rental and drove off, stomachs full of happiness."}
{"text":"It's another beautiful sunny Arizona morning after an evening of birthday festivities...which after seeing \"Check Please\" was celebrated here at  Mariscos Playa Hermosa.  We were a party of 10 with a reservation and ready to sample what appeared to be some great seafood!  The restaurant is small with lots of beautiful colors and wooded tables with authentic chairs and I felt like I was in Mexico!  The atmosphere was a bit chaotic ... Although they were not super busy they were running around like chickens with their heads cut off... BTW... Today's special.... Chicken! ... NOT!   In reading previous reviews... The biggest complaint is the service... Or lack of it!  Boy oh boy... They were not kidding!  Why o why do they not have ample employees?  Or at least experienced ones?   HEY OWNER... Do yourself a favor... HIRE SOME EMPLOYEES!!  Moving right along... The place is small so you can imagine it would be loud... Which it was... but that's ok.. Made it feel more festive!  It took forever to just get water and for 10 people they gave only 2 bowls of chips and tiny saucers of hot sauce... Water glasses and drink refills RARELY happened!  We tried many item between all of us.  The larger whole fish was moist and delicious! This was the best part of the evening!  They served their complimentary ceviche which was enjoyable and might I add... A nice touch!  The shrimp and fish in garlic sauce... Let's talk about that for a sec....  Ok, just the other day I cooked some shrimp on the Barbie bathed in butter/garlic. Mine was equally as good if not better because my shrimps were larger.  They use a medium shrimp that's tasty but nothing the average Joe can't make themselves... The fish part of the dish was a saturated fried piece...   Didn't try the rice simply because it looked unappetizing and did not care for the beans... I related them to baked beans... Like in hot dogs and beans... That's the initial taste.  We also tried the crab enchiladas ... Again not impressed... It was filled with crab meat but did not care for the taste ... Nor did anyone at the table.  The tortillas were tortillas nothing special.  Back to the service...I don't want to hear excuses like \" it was very busy\" because according you all those 5 star reviews( which I just don't get) you should expect it to be super busy on a Saturday night!  One end of the table was almost finished by the time the other end got their food... The servers had absolutely no idea who had what so she pretty much passed the plates and we figured it out ourselves!    I had to ask for all the dirty dishes to be taken away as nobody came to take them.  On to dessert...they knew we were there for a Birthday and we had to remind them several times.  For the birthday girl they give a piece of cake and she chose \" tres leche cake\" the cake was unlike any Tres Leche I have had.. Had a raspberry? Filling and did not taste very leche... I am no expert at this but the ones I have tried sit in the leche which absorbs into the cake making it somewhat soggy and delicious... This was different ...  I am sure there are many different kinds but it was not a hit at the table...  So, they have this other deal... Where they bribe you to YELP a reviews using names of servers and when they confirm it was posted they give you a piece of coconut cake...so one of the kids at the table did it...  I must say...the coconut cake was delish! Very moist and lots of coconut!  Getting the check was another challenge and when we did get it they charged for 3 items of which we only had 2....  Really makes me wonder... Between the REVIEW BRIBES and the mistakes on the check.... How much money they make this way?  Since we live nowhere close the chances of any of us returning are slim ...  On goes my quest to find some great Mexican food!  I imagine when a restaurant knows they are going to be on TV they make sure everything tastes great and service is great...  But on any other day you see how it really is... Don't believe everything you see on TV  It is a cute place and the fish was good... Give it a try... See what you think!  Never base a decision on one persons review... Food is a preference and I am very tough critic!    Bon Appetite'"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here on our way through Phoenix on a road trip.  The food was really good and the margarita was tasty.  We really enjoyed the shrimp ceviche as well.  On our way back to the airport we stopped again for some food for the plane. The best part, the food was good and inexpensive! This will definitely be our go to spot anytime when we fly into Phoenix! Oh yes, the staff was very friendly also :-)!"}
{"text":"The moment I entered this place it's like I'm in a giant playroom. The place is very bright and colorful. I wouldn't be surprised if Dora or the whole Sesame Street Gang suddenly showed up.  We ordered the Molcajete and fish ceviche. The Molcajete ($22) is the bomb! It's this delicious dish that has beef, chicken, shrimp, and fish lined up around on what seems like the Wicked Witch's cauldron filled with tomatillo sauce. It's enough for two people. You'd know its one of their popular dishes because all the other tables have it. One group of people even ordered three! It's like we were part of a Mexican witch convention. It was pretty amusing.  My husband got the $4 draft beer which he later regretted because there's this promo girl who gave out some freebies including a bottle of Budweiser beer for each of us. I'm not sure if they do that all the time. I guess we're just lucky. We went on a Friday night so we got a live background music from their Mariachi band.  Overall, we loved it! Can't go wrong with Mexican seafood. We'll definitely be back.  Trivia: Apparently, the Molcajete is the traditional Mexican version of mortar and pestle. Thanks Wikipedia!"}
{"text":"Super good!!! Ordered ceviche! My husband ordered shrimp cocktail and it was filled w shrimp! we got free tostadas! The mangoyada was perfect-enough tequila and chamoy! Only negative is they only have one bathroom! Service was great overall!"}
{"text":"Usually when I visit my family in Phoenix it takes what seems like a lifetime to find a place to eat that is not the tried, true, and tired.  Eating at this modest restaurant was the culinary highlight of my trip to Phoenix.  I implore all Phoenicians to frequent this establishment and your taste buds will thank you.  For starters, the chips were wonderfully light and not too oily.  The chips come with two different types of salsa.  A red salsa with a little bit of a bite and a green avocado salsa that is mild with just the right hint of avocado.   I ordered the shrimp in garlic sauce and the dish was sublime.  The shrimp were sauteed with red bell peppers and onions.  The vegetables were cooked perfectly - not too soft and not too crunchy.  The garlic sauce was wonderfully sweet and garlicky.  I couldn't get enough of it.  My dining companions both ordered the Camarones Culichi.  This dish is freaking amazing!  It consists of shrimp cooked in a green tomatillo sauce and loaded with melted Manchego cheese.  The sauce is divine and words cannot describe it properly.    The perfect accompaniments to these dishes were Mexican Coca-Colas (Yay!), creamy beans topped with cheese, and white rice with vegetables.  The tortillas were right on and looked to be homemade.  Leave behind the comfort of the fancy pants restaurants that the trendinistas like to go to and try something real.  You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"I was working in the area and was hungry for a traditional ceviche. Found this place on yelp and did not look like anything special from the outside, but WOW! Amazing ceviche, great service and great prices!! Nice and clean on the inside as well. I will make sure to come back next time I am in the area. Todo muy rico!!!"}
{"text":"Loved everything so DELICIOUS! Excellent service, finger licking food and good music :) will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Enough the shrimps in red sauce. Hot, spicy, wonderful. Bright and beautiful. Service is excellent. Amazing micheladas. Every dish is cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Great little authentic Mexican restaurant. The waitstaff are friendly and pleasant. The food was great- we started with the shrimp cocktail (so fresh and delicious) then we shared the mocajete diablo (holy hot!) featuring fish, shrimp, chicken and beef in a sizzling red sauce with an abundance of melty, gooey cheese (the cheese pull was epic). Rice and side salad weren't great (but that's coming from someone who rarely eats Mexican rice- just not enough flavor and too many carbs). The Cadillac margarita was tasty too. And, did I say it was little? Well I meant it- the interior dining room is tiny. Just something to note if you have a large party. Looking forward to dining here again!"}
{"text":"This is definitely authentic Mexican seafood. Everything was delicious! Try the \"tostada de Marlin\" and \"ceviche de camaron\" they rock! And trust me on this one, this review is coming from a Mexican"}
{"text":"Found references on Yelp and gave it a try. I gound a wonderful, colorful, small family restaurant close to Sky Harbor. It was packed with young local families. Service was pleasant and efficient. The shrimp with tomatilla, cheese and cilantro was superb. I'd heartily recommend. I will go back whenever I get the opportunity."}
{"text":"The child relleno I had was delicious! The Chile was fresh and not from a can. Chips were crisp and tomatillo salsa with avocado was very good. The rice was ok, it could have been made with a little more seasoning. The re fried beans did not taste vary good. Not sure if they were fresh or not. The inside is nice and colorful. Staff is friendly and very accommodating. Parking is small but worth coming to try. Next time I will have a seafood dish!"}
{"text":"Micheladas with Dos X on tap with a dozen oysters on the side? GAME OVER! This place is the best of the best when it comes up to mariscos."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. It's like a fancy hole in the wall with waiter service. The starter chips and guacamole salsa are very good. For an appetizer, we ordered the choriqueso which was piping hot cheese with chorizo mixed in. It was excellent! The fried shrimp came with rice and beans and was fried and seasoned very well. The refried beans were tasty. My sister let me try her carne asada taco and the meat was well done. My sister's fiancé ordered bacon wrapped shrimp with cheese and it was the best thing I tried. Must get! My cousin's fried fish in garlic sauce was also good. My dad ordered caldo de camaron (shrimp soup) and he liked it a lot. Alcohol menu was decent and they make virgin margaritas, too."}
{"text":"Great flavors and big portions. Being from SoCal I was impressed with the quality of the seafood! The shrimp ceviche and shrimp cocktail tasted fresh.  The cocktail was on point with an extra side of fresh avocados!  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"So my coworker and I had a business trip to Chandler, AZ and I had told him about my last two experiences eating seafood in the desert. Fish tacos that looked and tasted like nasty dried chunks of leather. You figure AZ shares a border with Mexico so they must share some learnings but it was nothing like the awesome fish tacos you get in San Diego. Need to avoid seafood in AZ.  We randomly drove by this place and decided, ok that looks interesting. Surprised me when I found it was another seafood joint. MMmm ok we're here and too hungry to look for another place.  So I ordered the crab enchilada plate and it was actually pretty good. Real crab meat stuffed enchiladas with rice and beans on the side. The shrimp ceviche tostada appetizer was also pretty good as well.  The exterior looks a bit sketchy but the interior decor was cute with a fishy motif straight out of the Bahamas. All in all a nice place for lunch."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Sunday and it was pretty packed. Well deserved though because excellent food and service. Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. There's so many nice touches, the experience is overall awesome.  We tried:  Molcajete Caliente: an incredible dish. Got it with the green sauce. It's so tasty but not spicy. Comes with steak, chicken, fish, and shrimp on the sides, but also octupus in the green sauce.  All the meat was perfectly cooked, but actually I enjoyed the fish the most, it was perfectly seasoned and juicy. Definitely a must try.  Guac: really fresh tasting and perfect with the chips"}
{"text":"Its Decorated very cute.  Michelada was excellent,  salsa was very good.  They have a lot of seafood options.  Food was good will go back."}
{"text":"This is my second time here at #MPH and it was a wonderful experience. The girls here are very friendly and greeted me right away. They had my food order ready, everything I requested was in the bag, and she even asked if I needed anything else. I would have loved a margarita to go but we all know that's not possible. haha.   I know I said, \"I wanted to try something new\" but I had to get the ceviche again. The shrimp was fresh, the veggies were just right and overall it was delightful. I'm a huge fan of this place and I recommend others to come here and pay them a visit. KUDDOS! I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"The place is small. The food was very delicious, the drinks are amazingly good! Our waitress was very attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"The further into the sketchier parts of Phoenix we drove, the more I knew that Mariscos Playa Hermosa was going to be legit. Its quite unassuming from the outside but the overly-enthused lobster sign out front let's you know you've arrived.  Don't judge a book by its cover.  Mariscos Playa Hermosa may appear a bit ghetto but open its doors and you've entered a tropical island paradise.  The inside reminds me of what the Chiquita Banana lady's house would look like...  blindingly bright colors, suns, moons, parrots, wooden fruit, flowers and trees.     There was one man running the show and he was superb.  Very attentive, expedient and friendly.   You won't be disappointed with the shrimp culichi or any of the cerviche menu options... not to mention the wide margarita selection."}
{"text":"Been there twice with the wife... I love the look inside, feels like you are actually in Mexico, very colorful, this is a very unique place we have here in the hood.  The service is great and the food is great."}
{"text":"I took the kids (20, 22 and 23) to Mariscos Playa Hermosa as a means of celebrating one of their birthdays.  OK, it's in a sketchy neighborhood, which for me translates into \"It's not some corporate craphole, reaking of generica\".  Fortunately I saved the receipt just for this review.  The first order was for the drunken shrimp, Camarones Ahogados, which is basically raw shrimp soaked in lime juice.  The idea was off-putting, but the execution is Awesome!  Delicious.  We next ordered the Camarones Culichi (shrimp in some sort of spicy cream sauce, I think), Filete de Pescado al Mojo (which looked good, but junior couldn't finish it.  There was too much for his stomach, already pre-filled with chips and some sort of green sauce, also awesome).  The last 2 orders were a Chile Relleno and Tacos de Pescado.  Anycase, the food was great and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Growing up in Phoenix I've tried a wide variety of Mexican restaurants. Finally a friend introduced me to Mariscos Hermosa and I fell in LOVE. Be forewarned, the location doesn't look very appealing from the outside. It isn't in the best of neighborhoods but don't let that fool you, this place is amazing! Inside it's very charming, Mexican sea life decor, the tables are very colorful and all look different. Soccer games are usually played on the televisions, it would be a good spot to come to watch your favorite team over some margaritas or delicious horchatas!   Their ceviche de pescado and camaron is my favorite dish. I'm a big seafood lover and this place knows how to do it right. If you're into oysters I also suggest ordering that to start. So good! Chips and salsa are given upon seating and their salsa verde is a bit spicy but so delicious. I wish I had a jar of it at home. Great horchata and cheap Negra Modelos! The staff has always been great and very friendly.   This place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall restaurant was the best thing for a lunch date! The food and service was amazing!"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican seafood, not as good as when I was living in Mexico (Guadalajara, Jal. primarily) but close enough to feel like as if I were there."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! My husband and I always leave satisfied! I always order the agua chile appetizer and my husband picks different things every time, but he has loved everything he has tried! They have these micheladas that are amazing! Beers on tap! Try it you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We looked for a locally owned Mexican restaurant and this one was close to our hotel (and airport). Fun atmosphere. Great patio. Food was fantastic and the service friendly and attentive. Wish they were in Denver we'd come all the time."}
{"text":"Camarones aguachile are aweeeeeeeeeeeeeesome!!!  I love this place if you like seafood and Mexican food then look no further this place is the bomb.  The service is good, they have great drinks alcoholic and non, and the food is amazing.  Plus the ceviche tostada for free at the beginning along with chips and salsa just tops off how wonderful this place is.    I admit it is pricey but the ingredients are fresh and we are in the desert so you gotta pay for good stuff and this place is for sure worth it."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Had the shrimp cocktail and molcajete with green sauce and it was so good! We went on a Sunday at around 6pm and it was very busy. We were asked to wait in the patio and we were seated within half an hour. The music is a bit loud but it's good upbeat Spanish music and I enjoyed it. It was difficult to hear my husband who was sitting right next to me and I felt like we had to yell just to have a conversation. Our waitress was very nice but since it was busy it took a little long to get drink refills and other things.  All in all it was a good experience and we'll be back."}
{"text":"First time very fresh seafood oysters platter was great  Service outstanding ! Drinks were good as well"}
{"text":"Stopped by after being let out early from a training class (I live in Tucson), based on yelp reviews. I have to agree with most of the posters. The place is small and practically hidden away, but it's clean and the staff is attentive. I ordered the shrimp fantasia which is bacon wrapped shrimp. I am not a fan of cheese on top, only because my doctor will probably have it out with me due to bacon alone, so I simply wiped it off. I must say, it was really good. Nice sized shrimp, appropriate amounts of filling and well cooked bacon. The rice and beans were typical, but I came here for the seafood and didn't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Shrimp cocktail and the 7 mares soup was great. Our server Ingrid was also awesome."}
{"text":"Ok,  this place is awesome.  If you are anywhere near the airport (or even if your not!) you must stop by here.  While listed as a seafood restaurant their menu covers the gamut.  Oysters are excellent.  If you like hot, their fish filet in diablo sauce is as good as it gets.  Look I eat Mexican all over the country and trust me when I say this place rocks.  Friday night they have a mariachis band.  Beer is cold and the margaritas are solid what more can you say.  One of the better Mexican restaurants in metro.......YES!"}
{"text":"This place was so good.  We went on a Friday night and a Mariachi band was playing, so it was crazy busy.  They offered to either seat us immediately on the patio, or let us wait outside for a table inside.  We opted to wait, and we were so glad we did.  The wait was pretty short and we ended up with an awesome table.  Awesome because of its location but also awesome because of the craftsmanship and artistry that went into the hand-carved and hand-painted table.  It was beautiful.  Then came drinks.  Our margs were a bit too sweet, but not too bad.  They need to use lime juice instead of bottled sweet-n-sour.  If they would have, we'd of ordered more drinks.  After drinks came the seafood ceviche.  SUPER GOOD.  We then got our shrimp fajitas, and those were amazing.  I think we'd go back, but we'd probably get margaritas elsewhere first."}
{"text":"Holy hell!! Lovely atmosphere, servers were nice but confused... the food seems prepackaged...like on the frozen thawed out side of things...the horchata was pink .... the salsa was hot sauce.... overpriced... never got our salads... didn't receive silverware until we were almost done with our food....the rice had your moms frozen peas and carrots mixed in it... 4.5 stars  I spent half the price for more authentic fresh food at las Gloria's and walked with left overs that I will eat now instead of my lunch.   I would give 5 stars for ambience and a nice waitstaff"}
{"text":"I was craving seafood and I'm super picking with seafood in Arizona. Yelped this place and decided to give it a try. Service and food were very good. Friendly staff and the manager even did his rounds to ask how everyones food tasted and/or if there was anything else they needed."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and great service.  We will definitely be back with friends.  The specialty dish was very good!"}
{"text":"Great place , delicious food, good music and friendly staff. I had the 7 seafood soup and its great for seafood lovers."}
{"text":"One of if not the best Mexican seafood restaurant in all of Arizona, the staff goes above and beyond to fill all your needs, the food is amazing and fresh, the drinks are a memorable part of the experience since they make sure to either add a twist in most of them or make them so good you'll remember them anywhere you go! The decorations are beautiful and make you feel like you've transported to Mexico as soon as you walk in! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service , waiting 49 minutes for a table, waitress took another 10 minuets to come and take our drink order , waitress left with our drink order (Margarita and beer) came back without drinks , took our food order , waited another 15 minutes still no drinks , but food arrived , ordered a shrimp cocktail and 2 shrimp tostadas and 3 tacos , still no drinks ... half way through our food (which was ok) waitress shows up no drinks and finally we asked we for water and she gave us another excuse as to why our drinks were not here yet, food was almost done and finally our drinks , waitress never came back another waitress delivered our drinks, and check .. will never go again , not sure why it receives 4-5 stars .... rethink about going to this place it's very small , and not organized enough , need better service ..."}
{"text":"Very festive décor with all kinds of little mermaid paintings and colorful chairs/counters. Chips are light and fresh and came with two salsas, a red and a green salsa.  Fast, friendly and attentive service.  Had the recommended crab enchiladas in a red sauce. Delicious and heavy on the crab, as it should be  BOTTOM LINE: Festive and delicious Mexican seafood in a strip-mall barrio kinda way"}
{"text":"I have to give Mariscos Playa Hermosa a really bad review. I called them at 7:45pm before driving from Scottsdale to ensure they would take us in. Their website says they close at 9pm. When I called they told me that as long as I got here at 8:30pm they would take us in. We arrived at 8:18pm & they had the doors closed. I called them from outside their door at they said they are closed. There service is horrible, they are not ethical or trustworthy. I'm really upset that they made us drive over 15 miles & not provide the service hours they advertise. I do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"How had I not been here before?!?! This place is close to my house, yet I never noticed it. I went here with the International Supper Club and was surprised at what a nice place this was. The ladies who work here were wonderful and accommodating to our ever growing party (uhh 2 more chairs please?) and managed to get most (not all) of the food out at around the same time for over 20 people... pretty good stuff. I went out on a limb, not being a fish person, and ordered the fish fillet divorciados and my risk came with great reward... this was delicious! It was a lightly fried fish fillet (that was HUGE) covered in half red sauce and half green. The red sauce was fairly good, but the green sauce was amazing... spicy, yet fresh tasting. The fish was so flaky and perfectly cooked.... it wasn't fishy at all. The plate was so huge, I shared with two other people and was still stuffed. As good as my dish was, the other couple dishes I tried weren't as delicious. I tried the fish tacos, which were very weird...like mini quesadillas with little bits of fish inside and they tasted very fishy....not my cup of tea. The al pastor tacos were alright, but nothing special. I think the key to this restaurant is to get the seafood (duhhhh). We also got to try several of their cakes which were all alright, but none were amazing. The coconut cake was my favorite. Anyway, I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"1st time here, it was great!! My husband had the crap enchiladas, very good!  I had shrimp cooked in a wonderful red sauce, spicy, loved it!!"}
{"text":"Best Michaladas in town! I really enjoyed the service, food and ambiance! I will definitely be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"It's a few short nervous blocks from the freeway.  Inside, it is a world of color, a world, of textures, a world of flavor (this is a pretty, pretty, vibrant interior - -  a complete world of fun if you weren't into the serious business of eating lunch).  I completely simpled out  when ordering and simply got the Mar Y Tierra  (surf & turf - - a stir-fry-up of strip steak and gobsmackingly richly embroidered shrimp).   The little tortilla that came as an appertizer-thingy with the meal was like tiny cubes of chunk tuna in a vinegar-like sauce.   The big plate with fine beans,  some salad accents,  and the incendiary steak&mind-blowing shrimp was super delicious.   A twenty covered it including tip.  Anytime, anywhere, take me back and please let me try some more menu items."}
{"text":"We just tried MPH for the first time. Absolutely full of color and charm, excellent service, and awesome food. Our waitress recommended the Molcajete Caliente (fish, chicken, shrimp, and beef draped over the edge of a serious bowl of boiling green sauce, with soft fresh corn tortillas, rice with vegs, and super good beans. Short story: It was amazing and we will be back."}
{"text":"The barbacoa enchiladas in red sauce were outstanding. Probably the best I've ever had. The guacamole, as a side, was unique, yet delicious in its own right. Neat atmosphere. Nice people. Easily a five star place for authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Our visit to Mariscos made us feel like we were on vacation in Mexico. The salsas (rojas and verde) and chips that we were greeted with were tasty, as was the ceviche. We started with the Mexican Shrimp Cocktail (we each had one), very nice with lots of shrimp and avocado. I had the green cheese enchiladas - LOTS of cheese and sour cream - yum! My husband had the octopus rancheros - he proclaimed it delicious. Both were served with rice, lettuce salad, and beans. The beans were much better than the usual.  We were too full for dessert, should have shared the shrimp cocktail.  House red wine was good and prices were reasonable. It's a long drive for us since we are near Pinnacle Peak, but we will be back."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! $4.00 24oz draft beers and delicious desserts rounded out an absolutely fantastic meal. We had shrimp ceviche. shrimp and fish tacos, and the Shrimp Culiche.  The shrimp ceviche had delicious spices, wonderful chunks of delicious goodness, and was definitely a 5 star dish.  My only kvetch would be that it needed about three more slices of avocado.  The shrimp tacos were good. Not 5 star--maybe 3 and a half since the shrimp tasted faintly (VERY faintly) of iodine, and I would have liked some freshness added into the taco--like shredded lettuce, or cabbage, or tomatoes, or something.  Fish tacos were bomb!  4 and a half stars.  They just miss being 5 star because they really were too salty.  HOWEVER, even with too much salt, I will order them again.  They were yummy.  The Shrimp Culiche, wow.  Amazing flavor.  My suggestion, soak up the crazy good sauce with maybe the rice, or dip your tortillas in it, but don't waste it!!!  Oh, and the restaurant is cute inside too!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for YEARS and just thought to review it?  WTF is wrong with me??????????????????????? THIS is Mexican seafood.  I've been to other places and nothing compares!  I take a book, sit in back and people watch while creaming my \"Make Me Yelp\" panties as I eat my culichi.  It's D I V I N E!  Eat the shrimp with a fork but you sure as Hell better use a spoon to destroy the rest of the bowl and leave it clean! Everything is fresh and the wait staff is loaded with recommendations.  Ask, and ye shall find.  The snapper Veracruz is so good I often order 2 and take one home.   The decor is fun - aquatic scenes that won't make you feel guilty for eating the seafood in front of you.   At Xmas they had a Santa at the door!  The people here a super-friendly!   They have their own parking lot.  You know it's a good place when yours isn't the fanciest car in the parking lot.  All kinds come here, despite the neighborhood not being the nicest in DoPho.  You can't miss it - even though I do pass it every time!  I think I'm too excited thinking of the shrimp culichi and my mouth is watering so much that I always manage to say \"Crap, passed it again!\" Go.  Just go to this place.  You won't be disappointed.  I swear.  And, you won't break the bank."}
{"text":"You can stop looking for any other Mariscos or Mexican restaurant. This place is BOMB!!! I've been here more times than I can remember and the food is absolutely amazing and fresh. The ceviche is out this world!! Here are some recommendations, the divorced fish, oysters, the mocajete, shrimp cocktail, the taquitos..yes..I'm just naming everything on the menu because everything is absolutely to die for. Oh! If you like heat, you're in the right place. If you want something spicy, just ask..just be prepared :)"}
{"text":"This place was great with lots of food! The shrimp tacos was great and the salsa is great! Would recommend and would go again if I return to Phoenix! Ignore the neighborhood the inside is great and food is worth stopping in for!!"}
{"text":"Ehhhhh the food was really expensive like reeeaaally expensive and not that amazing in my oppinion. But it was a big amount i didnt even want to finish the leftovers cuz after the meat was gone the rice and beans were just bland the decor is really pretty mariachis are cool but theres 0 space"}
{"text":"Last summer my boyfrined and I started the Summer Ceviche Project, which was to visit all the Mexican seafood places that populate the southern part of the near-east side.  This was the first place we tried.  After 13 places, we stopped trying anything else.  This is literally the gold standard.  Not to say there isn't amazing ceviche in other places, or even great ceviches at trendier spots.  This is just what all ceviche needs to start its life as: shrimp, cucumbers, onions and tomato.  Slice of avacado on top, ample selection of hot sauces if you so desire.  (He does, I don't.)      If you want to add or create away from that basic recipe.  So be it.  It's been done nicely at loads of expensive trendy spots. (Scottsdale: Seriously, $10 for a tostada?) But if you do it this good, why in the world would you mess with it?  Back to MPH:  The tomatillo-avacado salsa is one of the biggest reasons I can never leave Phoenix.  I would literally crinkle up and die if I didn't get it once a week.  Just go.   It's seafood, so the regular menu is not \"cheap mexican.\"  BUT, nine times out of ten, I just go in for a beer, a ceviche tostada.  If we go during happy hour, two beers, two ceviche tostadas and chips and salsa will set me and the boy back $12.  During scorching summers, who wants any more food than that?  When it's 115 outside, getting a lovely, air conditioned place to sit, drink a beer, eat great food....and leave for under $20 for two people makes this a true find.  Last note: the place is freaking ADORABLE, the service is amazing, and if you go more than twice, they will start to remember you.  Which is nice."}
{"text":"We started with shrimp cocktails, Modelo negro draft and Michelada. Cocktail was perfect and they provided plenty of limes, hot sauce, ketchup and crackers. Lastly we shared their Molcajete with a very savory tomatillo sauce surrounded with grilled fish, shrimp, chicken and beef. Lets not forget the sides of white rice, beans and salad. We will be back. The price was not bad either."}
{"text":"This place was ehhh...not impressed. The campechana was really small for 15.00.  The oysters were very small and dirrty. They didn't taste fresh either. 3 Carne Asada tacos plate has no flavor and it really didn't look like Carne Asada either.  I don't get all these 4-5 star reviews.  The only thing good there was the waitress, who was attentive.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here. Overall was not disappointed. I thought the service was great. The wait staff was excellent. I had their fish ceviche with an horchata. The fish ceviche was not the greatest I've ever had but it was really good. I'm always skeptical about eating ceviche at a restaurant but this place didn't disappoint. And it was on special so it was about 8 bucks. The horchata was pretty good. I checked in on Yelp and got a free piece of cake. I'm glad I tried this place out. I'll definitely come again."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and was so surprised it wasn't packed, based on all the great reviews on here.  But, it was a rainy day so that may have deterred some people from going out.  The prices here are a bit higher than you'd typically expect at a regular Mexican restaurant, but you have to keep in mind that you're ordering seafood and seafood in the desert ain't cheap.  (well, it's probably cheap at some places but it's also probably really gross at those places).  for the non-seafood entrees the prices were lower and more what you'd expect.  I ordered a fish taco entree that came with 3 tacos and beans and rice for only $8.99, so that's not bad at all.  The fish was fresh and tender and I really enjoyed the tacos.  However, I did not care for the complimentary fish ceviche tostada thing they served - the fish there tasted a little \"off\" to me.  I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Best tasting Authentic Mexican food! Great service!! Close to downtown Phoenix. Cute fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this has such great reviews...our food was terrible!! :/ I felt sick the rest of the evening...the ceviche looked like it had fish particles in it. It tasted really bad. :/"}
{"text":"Every time I come here the seafood is fresh and well prepared. My favorite is the \"Botana de Mariscos Frios \"."}
{"text":"Clean... Fresh.... Friendly.... Delicious. Hey yelpers get here and devour til your hearts content. Awesome!"}
{"text":"So we pull up and the first thing we see are 2 Phoenix police cars -- SCORE!  You know cops always know where to find good food!  LOL.    This place is fantastic!  After only one visit, I'm rating it a conservative 4-stars, but I can easily see upgrading to 5-stars after a few more visits.  The food is the star here.  We ordered the ceviche with fish and shrimp to start, and it was well-balanced and fresh!  One ingredient didn't overpower the others.  It's served with adorable tostada rounds versus chips, but you can always use your chips they automatically deliver to each table also.  Neither my BF nor I were super hungry, so we both ordered tacos -- I ordered the shrimp tacos and he ordered the fish tacos, and then of course we shared because, well, that's what we do.  I'm always hesitant to have my tacos served with cheese already served on them, but I'm so glad I didn't order cheese on the side!  My tacos were in toasted flour tortillas (they normally come with corn tortillas, but I asked for flour) and had the perfect amount of melted cheese holding the sides together.  Just thinking about them makes my mouth water.  The pinto beans served with the tacos are also really flavorful.  (They're also served with some greens, but I didn't eat them -- who has time for salad?)  With a Yelp check-in, you get a free slice of cake, so we ordered the coconut cake. OH-EM-GEEEE!  This is literally the best coconut cake I have ever had in my life!  The flavor of the coconut really shines through and is not diluted by sugar or cake.  Neither of us could believe how good it was.  Even as we were getting up to leave, my BF was scraping the plate clean of the rest of the cake. LOL, greedy self!  The only possible area for improvement are the margaritas.  I initially ordered just a house margarita and my BF ordered the mango margarita.  Although the flavor was good in both drinks, the tequila was lacking.  I'm not trying to get lit off of one margarita, but I should feel a little something. LOL.  But we both ordered the Cadillac margarita as a second drink and that one was WAY better!  Next time I'll just start with that one.   All in all, a pretty great experience, and I look forward to going back to try more items (and get some more coconut cake)!"}
{"text":"GREAT food and service from Brenda!  Tried this for the first time with my visiting family and it was a great experience.  Sat outside on the patio and enjoyed the music even though we had every intention of sitting inside and listen to the mariachi band.  Definitely will be going back"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with family and no one complained. Everyone loved what they had. They make great Margaritas, the house Margarita is wonderful and the strawberry is made with fresh fruit. They brought us a complimentary ceviche tostada, the fish so so fresh and delicious the citrus flavors were amazing. The chips are freshly baked and the salsa's are wonderful, the green is mild not sure how it is made and the red is spicier but still has manageable for someone like me that isn't into spicy and great for someone who loves spicy like my husband; wonderful flavors. My mother loved the fried shrimp said it was one of the best fried shrimp she had in a long time. My husband and I along with my father-in-law shared the earthen pot filled with steak, seafood and chicken that came with an amazing green sauce ( we choose the mild for me). Along with it is your choice, or you can get both, homemade flour or corn  tortillas. The sides of rice and beans are even very good. For dessert we had the flan and the coconut cake both were excellent but wish they would bring back the tres leche cake that I had the last time we were there which was to die for. We will definitely return and a lot sooner this time."}
{"text":"Super good seafood platters! This last visit we ordered three different shrimp entrees. Camarones culichi, camarones al mojo de ajo, and camarones fantasia. Complimentary ceviche tostadas are so good. Friendly staff and great food keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great sea food. I recommend the shrimp ceviche. The wine was poured generously which is always nice."}
{"text":"Seafood Mexican???? Really???? REALLY!!!!! This is the bomb! The best Mexican I have ever had in my life!  Funky, but good!  Go with the big seafood sampler, but share it with a friend, as it will feed you both,  Tis place is truly a hole in the wall, and I saw some people walk away from the menu looking for the traditional taco, but boy did they miss the boat!!!  If you love great food and want to be adventurous, go for it, you will never regret it.  Next time I'm in Phoenix, I will be stopping by."}
{"text":"Best Mariscos I have ever had in Arizona. everything was so fresh and delicious. I had all cold Mariscos, which included: shrimp, callos de scallops, and oysters. wife had fried fish which she loved. service was great. I will definitely keep coming back here every day I am in mood for Mariscos."}
{"text":"I'm in town for a conference and tried it because it was close to the motel.  Holy cow was I pleasantly surprised.  It was excellent.  I've had a couple of disappointing Mexican seafood restaurants, but not Mariscos Playa Hermosa! The chips and both salsas were good.  I order a bean and cheese burrito to play it safe.  They brought me a free appetizer, a fish de gallo tostado and I was hooked. This east coast gringo will be back and I'll bring a couple of friends to try authentic Mexican.  Excellent!  Service was excellent to boot.  I have a new favorite in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Excellent food!! We stopped here on our way through Phoenix to sedona and was really impressed with the food here. I ordered the chicken enchiladas and my husband got the shrimp tacos- both were super good!"}
{"text":"I came by myself on a Tuesday night hoping for a decent meal. What I got was a fantastic meal with impeccable service. First I started with a Michelada, well seasoned and just the right ratio of red, to beer. Hey oh! Just what I needed.  I was excited for the prepared Oysters which were top notch, filled with extras, and fresh. They also treated me to a fish ceviché tostada, that I would absolutely purchase again. Get the ceviché tostada.   The recommendations from staff were spot on and I wish I had gotten the fajitas because when the sizzling skillet's flavor wafted past me... I realized I should have purchased them immediately.   Still, my entree was fantastic and that rice, unique, and flavorful.   Can we talk about the ambiance here? Super duper colorful and unique (at least for Phoenix)!"}
{"text":"We've visited this place several times and it's always a great experience. Very festive vibe, friendly staff, draft beer is served super cold with lots of limes..and the food is excellent. We've never had a bad dish, but some are just outstanding. The Camaron Culichi is ridiculous how good it is, as is the Camaron Cocktail and the various enchiladas. We bring our East coast family here to get a taste of what a nice cantina in Mexico would be like without leaving the city. Always a hit."}
{"text":"The exterior and surrounding area may deter you from this place, but the food and service is excellent.  I tried one of the fish dishes and my friends tried other items on the menu and we really liked the food here.  It is conveniently located near the auto rental facility near Phoenix airport, making it a good place to grab lunch or dinner before heading out from the airport"}
{"text":"People there are super nice but the food is AMAZING! Probably the closest to a real mexican food"}
{"text":"Best Micheladas ever !!! They provide chips, salsa and fish tostada as an appetizer  yumny in my tummy... I have had the culichi shrimp  ( favorite) it's amazing... they have good hot seafood plates.. Once I ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp and it was yucky, raw.. but everything else great !"}
{"text":"The food was great, the band was excellent and the service was wonderful. First timer from Atlanta"}
{"text":"We came on Mother's Day, very busy and loud from music, it was quite the celebration here. The place was nice and clean, a lot of selections to choose from the menu. The customer service was prompt and professional. The food did take a while, but it's normal for Mother's Day. It's very hard to find a good Mexican seafood place in Phoenix. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm not from here and was looking or some authentic Mexican food.  I found this place while driving on the highway after picking up family up from airport. Based on the reviews (4+ stars), I thought it would be a good place to eat on the fly.   I should have been leery when the restaurant was empty at lunch time (12:30).   The set up was very nice with indoor and outside seating.  Service was slow.  It took a while for everything (order, drinks, appetizers, check) despite there being few diners. Margarita was weak.  Fajitas didn't sizzle.  My family thought that the food lacked flavor (added lots of extra hot sauce ) but I thought it was OK (only added a little hot sauce).    Next time I'll pull over and spend a little more time researching so I don't end up at a place like this again."}
{"text":"What a fantastic meal I had.  I've been desiring amazing Mexican restaurants in Arizona.  Since I moved here, I've been to several places that were underwhelming, at best, and generally just not good to me.  So, I'd given up on Mexican Food in AZ and I just didn't eat any.  Well, a conversation in Yelp Talk about Mexican Food inspired me to check out some different places and this one turned up in my searches on Yelp and other websites.  I'm happy to say that I was so thrilled and enjoyed my meal very much at Mariscos Playa Hermosa.  Again, another hole-in-the-wall, but still quite the find.  Mariscos is located in a pretty seedy part of town, so don't get nervous going there.  They close early, so you'd better arrive early.  You will find that there is a full bar inside this colorfully decorated resto.  Don't eat at the bar.  That things not suitable for anything except decoration as the bar itself doesn't extend out far enough to make it comfortable to sit there.  (this is a tip from a person who opted to sit at the bar)  I tasted a few items off the menu.  The shrimp in diablo sauce was my favorite.  I ordered extra diablo sauce on the side.   The sauce has a smokey taste with the heat of the peppers.  Perfect for my heat seeking taste buds.  They prepare the sauce \"fresh to order\".So there is a charge for $3 for the extra sauce on the side to go.  I used that sauce to make more shrimp diablo at home later that week.    I also enjoyed the camarones culichi... shrimp in green sauce.  Culichi is a tomatillio sauce made with some dairy product and cilantro and of course the poblano or tomatillio peppers.  The sauce is simply to die for.  I left there satisfied and happy!    I will return and take a friend for the Molcajete Caliente with verde sauce.  Can't wait.  I'm sure it will please.  They have a check-in offer too, so be sure to check-in.  Oh, that parking lot is TINY.  Be aware of that when you go."}
{"text":"So delicious! I can't wait to go back. The food was fresh and hot and the serving sizes were large. I really enjoyed this place, a definite must try!"}
{"text":"At 1 PM, we were handed large menus with several dozen interesting choices. Only one seafood entree (fish tacos) on the entire 4 pg card was less than $12, and that included soups. I didnt really want to settle for fish tacos in a lauded casa de mariscos.    Entrees come with complementary ceviche tostadas, which was a nice surprise.  My son had the house specialty,  camerones culuchi, and I tried a flash-fried whitefish, served whole with sides, for 15 bucks.  We agreed the green culuchi sauce bathing six shrimp was instantly forgettable. My fish had about 150 pin bones and less meat than a small can of tuna fish. That's not an attempt at humor. I can debone a fish and there was less meat on this crispy carcass than a standard 6 oz can of tuna, as if they extracted most of it for their own devices, leaving me with little more than skin, bones and an eyeball.    It's hardly a crummy place on the inside - the decor is cute and colorful.  Service seemed friendly, if a bit confused, and having grown up in New England,  I'm aware seafood can be pricey.  That said, after tax and tip, we spent $40 for one meh and one pretty craptastic lunch, in a hole in the wall just south of Roosevelt.   Judging from the other reviews, it sounds like we just came at a bad time, but that doesnt help me get my forty dollars back. Two stars for the ceviche."}
{"text":"Awesome! Passing through checking Yelp for dinner @6:30pm on a Saturday night and so many places were closed or closing by 7 pm good thing cause then I found #MariscosPlayaHermosa directions off I-10 had us questioning the neighborhood, but it was fine...this place was BUSY! So I knew I had found a Gem! The wall was covered with awards, and newspaper article reviews! The food, service and atmosphere was great! I wish I was in the area more often...highly recommend this restaurant! The Molcajete was super!"}
