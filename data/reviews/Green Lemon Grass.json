Awesome!"}
{"text":"Green Lemon Grass is located in Richlane Mall, where they have served the Richmond Hill neighbourhood for over a decade.  This restaurant is like a busy bee, tables always full, continuous short lineups and fast service.  In other words, table turnover rates, on average, are high.

The menu is based on comfort foods of noodles, curry, roti, rice and soups.  Do not expect fine dining here.  They built their reputation for fast convenient meals (fast food like).

BBQ Chicken & Spring Roll Vermicelli ($7.75) was a mixture of grilled chicken, fried spring rolls, topped with peanuts, carrots, cucumbers, shredded lettuce and mixed with fish sauce.  Served dry and warm, it was quite appetizing with the tangy fish sauce.  The chicken was over-grilled and very dry; rubber-like texture.  The spring roll was also over- fried, where parts of the wrapper was burnt; however, was crunchy.  But burnt food can cause cancer.

Small Rare Beef Noodle Soup ($6.75) has bean sprouts, slices of  beef and garnished with green onion and a sprig of mint leaves.  The beef was thinly sliced and lightly cooked; therefore, the texture was well maintained and easily absorbed the soup base.  It had a very standard pho soup base, therefore tasted consistent with my perception of pho.

I found both noodles were extremely salty and had too much MSG to it.  Water was being chugged down the throats for the rest of the afternoon and evening.  For the speedy service, convenience of meals, on a tight schedule, does not hurt to go.  But if you are looking for an enjoyable, savory meal, then this restaurant is not what you are looking for."}
{"text":"The service was rude.  I left a tip on the table but the waitress/owner didn't see it and loudly told us in front of all the customers that we forgot to leave a tip.  It was embarrassing and they shouldn't have done that.  Even if we didn't leave a tip, they should have swallowed that and kept their mouth shut over a tip.  Now, I will never go back to that restaurant over that experience and it's not worth losing a customer over a tip."}
{"text":"SERVICE SUCKS !
I was there to buy a take-out lunch today before the rush hour.  After I paid for the purchase, I took a seat next to the cashier and waited for 5 minutes.  Then a waitress came by and said to me: \"You have to wait outside (i.e. outside the restaurant in the hall) for your take-out.  If you sit here, people walking by our restaurant may think it is full and would not come in.\"  I looked around and there were at least 3 empty tables and no waiting customers.  I told her if there are customers waiting for the seats, I'd gladly wait outside.  So I stay put.  Moments later, a Caucasian customer walked in.  She seated him next to me and said: \"There is customer now.  You have to wait outside.\"   WTF!  I then told her I am also a customer too.  If I have to wait outside, then they can change my take-out order to dine in instead.  I told the gentleman sitting next to me about what's happening and asked if he mind I stay seated for another 5 minutes. He had no objection at all.  Then I told the waitress I already asked their customer and he doesn't mind me sitting with him.  At the end , they gave me my lunch and I left.  At the time of leaving, there were empty tables and no line up still.
DON'T THEY UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THESE DAYS?  Customers don't just buy your goods, they also buy goods along with service.  
@X%^*!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for viet in Richmond Hill
Must haves
1) House Special Beef Noodle Soup 
2) Curried Beef Brisket with Roti (portions on the smaller size but worth it)
3) House fried vermicelli noodle (I think #40 / #41) with chicken, shrimp, veggies
4) Spring Rolls

Tried almost all the viet restaurants within 15 minute drive from 16th & Bayview and this one is the best!"}
{"text":"The best pho place I have been to in my opinion!  And I love pho! Unsure about any of the other food they serve there,  as the pho is just so good I don't bother getting anything else.  
Only con I can think of,  is during summer sometimes,  may get a bit warm while eating the delicious hot pho,  since the store is open air to the rest of the mall,  which doesn't have that great air conditioning. 

Definitely would recommend to anyone,  I eat here on a weekly basis,  even twice a day sometimes."}
{"text":"I was so excited to visit Green Lemon Grass; I've worked in the area for three years but had never ventured into the Richlane Mall to see what it had. After doing some looking on yelp, I was so hopeful that maybe I had found an awesome place to get my Vietnamese fix on my lunch break. Let me tell you, I was so disappointed.

Arriving at the restaurant, I was really excited about how good it might be. The restaurant was full, clean and modern looking. Big groups of people ate from family style dishes full of spring rolls, noodles and other delicious looking fare. I prefer to eat at my desk, so I placed an order with the pleasant hostess and wandered the mall for about 5 minutes. I came back in half the time they would said it would be and it was ready.

Arriving back at work, I immediately had some concerns as I started to take my meal out of the bag. It smelled...not great. And then when I opened the box, I once again had hope. I had ordered the grilled chicken, spring roll with vermicelli (in my experience Vermicelli normally means thin little noodles, and what I was served were big thick noodles, larger than spaghetti) and it looked pretty good.  The chicken was fatty, but no big deal. 

Starting to eat, the noodles were unappetizing and tasteless, regardless of how much fish sauce I drowned them in. The chicken was mostly fat and skin, and had been drenched in lemon pepper seasoning. Underneath the noodles were a few shreds of lettuce and cucumber (nothing else to add flavour like mint or cilantro). I struggled through a few bites and then was hoping to be redeemed by the spring roll. I mean, I've never even had a bad spring roll. But there is a first time for everything. It tasted like it had been in the freezer for a year, and then fried in dirty oil.  Second bite I actually spat out. And then threw out the entire container. 

Some people seem to love this place, but after this experience I will not be able to make myself go back and try something else. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"The decor is casual but interesting.  Definitely not for formal dining, but if you are into grabbing a quick tasty bite lunch or dinner, this is one of the best ones in the area.

The one dish that stands out most here is the curry lamb rice. This is the best place you can get s.e. Asian style curry lamb in gta. The pho were generally above average, and there are better places.  The food generally is quite good.

Roti dishes, rice, sweet vermicellis, are quite delicious.  If I have one peeve its that other than their curry lamb, the other curry dishes were their weakest offering here.   

But theres is more than enough variety to make this worth a visit for casual lunch or dining."}
{"text":"We have been there recently again.  I have to agree that their service was fast and courteous. 

I enjoyed their Pho the most, big portion for the 3 times we've visited.  

Their roti and curries are A-OK.  I found roti too gressy.  I guess I am comparing against Restoran Malaysia (my fav).  But curries were above average thai places- big portions."}
{"text":"Third visit, that says something, and it keeps getting better.

Only thing is they only take debit or cash, so be prepared. BUT also be braced for big flavour. While it comes across as a Vietnamese pho joint, you really do want to venture beyond that section of the menu.

I went with my best friend at 5:20-ish for dinner, and there was hardly anyone in the usually bustling little restaurant. Hence, the server seemed to be in a better mood. We ordered the small satay beef pho ($7.50) and the curry beef brisket with roti ($12.95), both to share.

The satay beef pho arrived within 5 minutes of us placing the order. When it arrived, we knew we were going to have to spend the $0.50 for take-out containers. The portion size could hardly be considered \"small\", it was definitely a mammoth compared to any bowl I've ever seen. The satay pho was nothing I've ever imagined. The soup stock was richly layered in terms of flavor and texture. The warm spice that wafts up with the steam, then the milky sweetness of coconut, then a mild tang of pineapples are but some of the flavours I most appreciated. The soup was also creamy from coconut milk and had surprising pieces of chopped roasted peanuts here and there. All these make the super tender slices of beef and pho themselves nearly sidekicks.

Then, halfway through our pho, the brisket curry and roti arrived. Both smelled amazing (though it also made it clear that I will be washing my scarf as soon as I got home). You know how most places try to rip you off by giving you a bunch of potatoes and two itty bitty chunks of meat? Well, this was not \"most places\". There was enough of that perfectly cooked, not-yet-disintegrating brisket drowned in an abundance of liquid gold - the curry gravy. And thattipsti...oh boy that pillow of fluffy, crispy, doughy, buttery roti. Words can't describe it, you need to have that roti, tear it with your very fingers, dunk it in the curry sauce, and send it straight in your salivating mouth.

I packed most of the curry as leftovers (yeah, we tried to finish, but obviously failed by a pretty wide margin).

Including tips, our dinner came to $25 flat.

Come again? Do you even need to ask?"}
{"text":"I love roti, but I couldn't find good place in Toronto. However this restaurant's roti is great!
Pho is good too."}
{"text":"I'd passed by this place a few times before but have never actually eaten here until this week. The menu offers a variety of Southeast Asian Foods including pho and curry. I ordered the goat brisket in curry with roti while my dad ordered the Hainanese chicken rice. The portions for the roti and the curry were HUGE, I ate just a little more than half of it before having to give the rest to my dad to finish. His Hainanese chicken rice, however, was quite small in comparison. There was a lot more rice than chicken and it just didn't look very satisfying. Taste wise, the curry was all right, but not blow-your-socks-off amazing. The roti was crispier and less doughy than what I'm used to, but it wasn't bad. I didn't get a chance to try the chicken rice. I also ordered a three colour drink and it wasn't terrible but it wasn't good either. The straw was too thin to even drink the red beans from so I had to mostly use the drink spoon. 

All in all, this wouldn't be my first choice to eat at, but it wouldn't be my last either. Maybe the pho and noodles would be worth giving a try in the future."}
{"text":"I come here for their roti and curry. So good! I can never finish it though. So I hate their 25cent charge on containers."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying out this place considering it was super busy the last time I tried coming here.  Unfortunately, this will be my first and LAST time here.  Here's why you should avoid this place:
1. Take-out charge (50 cents)- although this is not much, I've never heard of a place that charges something that is part of their business expense!  No other restaurant charges this type of fee for something customers can't finish.

2. Does not accept credit card- only debit cards and cash.  However,  as I was going to pay with debit the machine wants to charge me a surcharge for using debit???!!!!  It's bad enough that they don't take credit cards and don't even tell customers in advanced but to charge customers for using debit card as well??  Here is another example of a business who indirectly just wants cash.  Probably reports only a portion of their earnings to CRA.  Honestly, I have never been to ANY restaurants that have this type of money-grabbing business practice as a way to boost their revenue.

3. Food- good but nothing to die for especially when they charge prices that are more than other places I've been to.  I ordered to Roti Curry, Curry chicken and Chicken Vermicelli.  Vermicelli isn't really authentic.  They used the 'Gui Lin' noodles instead of the true rice noodle (mei-fun) that most other places use and the chicken portion is very small. 

4. Service- average.  It is a typical Chinese business who thinks that just because they are getting business they can treat their customers badly.

Annoyed at all the above I gave them a $1 tip to show my disdain for this place the the lady has the nerve to tell me that I gave her too little and that she needs to survive on tips, etc.  I ended up giving her two bucks but am never coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"A friend originally introduced me to this place for the pho which was quite good - tried the rare beef (good) and the spicy satay (excellent). I've been back lots and times and discovered the curry was amazing; I usually go for the curry brisket. Order it with the crepe (or flatbread - I forgot what it was on the menu) as it's much better than just the rice."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday lunch and this place was packed! Waited around 10 mins for a table.

Special beef pho noodles - Beef is very high quality, unlike other vietnamese restaurants. However, the broth has a lot of msg. The noodle portion is around average. 

Satay beef pho noodles - This tastes just like curry on top of the noodles, nothing special. The type of noodles used in this is the thicker rice noodles. More noodles than the one above. 

Pad thai - This should be called tomato fried pho noodles. Much like the one at congee queen, but sweeter. The ingredients used are descent quality, but authentic pad thai should not be cooked with tomato sauce. 

Overall 2/5 stars. Quality is good, but the taste is not the best. Not very authentic vietnamese food."}
{"text":"This is my favourite vietnamese restaurant of all time! I've been to A LOT of vietnamese restaurants across the GTA and this is the only one that has stayed consistent and there's nothing here that I've tried that I wasn't good. Everyone that I've brought here LOVE their curry roti beef brisket. They give you a large portion of roti, the beef brisket is super tender and the curry flavour/texture is PERFECT. Their special beef noodle is always good too. They give you lots of soup and the flavour is always on point. Although its fairly far for me now that I've moved, my husband and I always think its worth the drive when we're craving vietnamese food. That's how good it is!!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for pho mainly because it's so close to where we live.
This place can get packed especially during the dinner rush and Sunday afternoons so try to go around these hours if you want to avoid crowds. That being said service is usually pretty prompt. 
Food is normally what you would expect of any pho place, I enjoy the vermicelli mainly because they always have good spring rolls, my wife likes the laksa noodles.
Portions are good enough to fill you up.
So if you're looking for someplace quick with decent vietnamese food this is the place to go"}
{"text":"Any dish with beef here is pretty bad. Literally too tough to chew. 

Curry is mediocre at very best. 

Definitely wouldn't recommend any of the drinks - everything tastes super watered down. 

Apparently the service here is infamous (downright rude), and I wouldn't disagree - it really is awful. 

Can't think of any reasons for me to suggest that anyone come to Green Lemon Grass, but I can come up with a whole bunch to avoid it!"}
{"text":"The pho was stale tasting or maybe it was the noodles. The meat balls were also lacklustre. Our second dish never arrived as the waitress forgot to order it. Given the taste of the pho, I had low incentive to stick around and find out. Too bad.  The waitresses are ok in terms of friendliness."}
{"text":"Tucked in Richlane Mall, this restaurant has been around for a while, serving adapted Malaysian / Viet / Thai dishes. The portions are big, but the price is not exactly cheap. A regular bowl of pho is served in huge bowls and its not uncommon to see a group of 2-3 with their tables full of plates.

My dad remembered this place serves up decent malaysian curry. The portions are huge, but the sauce lacks some spices and depth and is a little runny. I was looking for some heathier options and the only 2 veggies dishes is yu choy in oyster sauce ($9) and stir fried green beans in balachan sauce ($15). Knowing the price of my veggies, I wouldn't pay $8 for a plate of blanched veggies. The stir fried green beans did not disappoint. The balachan toppings are crispy, delicious, and the dish comes with 8 large shrimps. Much better ingredients for the price.

Also ordered the lemongrass meats (chicken and pork chop) ($12). Tastes amazing, and not expensive for the amount and quality of the meats. If you're trying to reduce carbs, consider getting this instead of the regular pho or the lemongrass meats served with rice. It is large enough to share with a small group."}
{"text":"Worse service and food, especially with the Malaysian chicken rice which came with a pain white rice!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and usually this place is fairly busy around lunch time. The good thing, however, is that the table turn around time is quick and the wait is usually short. However, if you're looking for amazing table service, you're not going to find it here. This is your typical Asian style eatery where your food will come as soon as it's ready, and often times, if you aren't dining solo, people at your table will be watching others eat. The saving grace is that food usually comes out so quick that the watching isn't very long.

I generally get the noodle soup (house special, beef satay, etc), which is usually good, but not particularly outstanding. The broth isn't overly complex in flavour, yet it's still oddly satisfying (not sure if this is because I'm usually starving around lunch), and not overly overly salty. In the past, I used to really like the satay beef noodle soup, but over time, I (and others) have found that the quality of it has declined. The roti is also pretty good and the portion size is substantial."}
{"text":"If you want good basic asian comfort food, then Green Lemon Grass is the place for you.  My friend took me here years ago and their roti canai was so memorable, I kept reminding her that we should go back for more.  I rarely go to this part of town (Leslie & 16th) plus this little complex of eateries is hidden so you won't know this place exists unless you work in the area.

We were able to get a table for 2 quickly on a Friday night. 
I got:
Beef Pho
Hot soup was perfect after a week of Arctic temps.  The small was more than enough for me, broth was just right, not too salty. Good ratio of beef, noodles and broth.
We shared:
Roti Canai
MmmmM! just as I remembered... fresh roti and flavourful curry sauce.
My friend got:
Hainanese chicken
She wasn't too thrilled with her dish, thought it would've been better.  I wouldn't know since I haven't had that dish before. Luckily, the roti canai saved the day.

Service was very fast and our water and tea was refilled without asking.
I'd give it 3.5 stars, but I do look forward to my next meal there (hopefully not in another few years) so I'll bump it up to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Ordered the House Special Beef Rice Noodles and the portion was small, especially the toppings. See the picture for the amount of tripe that they put in. Plus service was bad. Not returning to this place."}
{"text":"Really tasty Malaysian food. Curry with rotis are amazing and tasty. Belachan shrimp green beans are my favorite too.  

They serve red bean and jello ice so that's a bonus when waiting for the food. 

They also serve pho and very delightful fried rice. 

Service is super fast and efficient. Even when packed, the tables are constantly turning because of the quick service.    

Parking is ample too.  The restaurants in this little plaza are built in an old hockey arena so ceilings in the main foyer are tall. 

On the flip side:  they can do a better job washing the vegetables. Found some grit, hopefully this is a one off as they are normally not gritty. 

Nevertheless I recommend this place based on the service, parking and the quality of food."}
{"text":"Tasty pho and good portions of meat. The only thing I don't like is how the restaurant has such a strong smell of pho, and you always end up smelling like it for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Meh. Not bad, but below average pho. Didn't enjoy the fish cakes. Not a consistency that I'm used to. The lighting made us feel depressed. 
Not a bad experience, but no reason to come back."}
{"text":"Green Lemon Grass recently renovated and looks better than before.  The food itself is still the same thou.  The Rare beef noodle is okay, the soup flavouring is decent, noodles not too soggy but the beef itself was a poor cut - tasted bad and rubbery.  Also Beef to noodle ratio isn't that good.  This place gets busy on most days and do require waiting.  The service is pretty fast when the staff is not too busy watching tv.  The pricing is decent compare to all other pho places.

Rating:

Service: 3/5
Food Quality: 2/5
Comfort 2/5
Decor  4/5
Value: 3/5
Parking: 4/5"}
{"text":"I've been looking all over for decent Vietnamese food in Richmond Hill and Markham area, but been sorely disappointed with Chinese-influenced alternatives so far. I really wasn't too hopefully with Green Lemon Grass, but at the least for the price I appreciated the effort and portions. Conveniently located, there's other options in the same food plaza if so desired, which really helps it retains brownie points.

My first impression of the pho was mushy. The broth was okay, and the toppings were alright. I get that pho isn't the chewy kind of noodle and some prefer them to be quite soft, but it really didn't feel right that first bite - kind of like the bowl had been neglected for a long time before serving. By the end of it, I figured I won't be back for pho.

The curry rice looked promising, and the assorted appetizer platter with spring rolls, skewers, and other fried items was a large portion. Unfortunately the flavour palette is not diverse - if it looks like it's curry sauce, it'll be curry sauce flavored - no matter if it's your rice, a skewer, or something else. Same went for deep fried items - everything has the same spices on it. They're not bad, but you'll have to create your own diversity by ordering different items to complement each other.

So far I've been back a handful of times out of convenience - the location is really close to me and it's not the usual Chinese food but still has Chinese food prices. Décor is outdated and everything is a bit old - but you're really not here for anything fancy in terms of ambiance. Service is also short - but that's similar to many other Asian places of the same setup."}
{"text":"Great tasting curry here, and good portions. There's quite a lot of gravy as well to soak up all the rice. Good stuff. 

My wife ordered Thai style pho, which was pretty decent. Its huge as well... medium is more than enough for one person. 

I was going to give 4 stars, except they charge 50c for takeout containers!! Never seen that before. 

Cash/ debit only"}
{"text":"The Decor: Nothing special. No really, don't turn around, don't judge this book by its cover- go in and sit down and order. I'm usually the only caucasian in the place which tells me I'm in for something authentic. I do get stares from other patrons though!

The ambience: Old tables, uncomfortable chairs and a TV playing chinese soaps at lunch. If you're really brave take a peak into the kitchen which is visible from anywhere your sitting. The servers put up with me and they really do understand your order as long as you point at the numbered menu. Always smiling and welcoming. The tall, plastic, well worn, foggy green tea glasses are a nice touch.......

The food: Absolutely authentic and the best thai/vietnamese fusion anywhere. Their curried beef brisket is my absolute favourite thing on the planet- you must try it. Heat is inconsistent but most of the time my scalp is sweating!!
Their pad thai is awesome too- there's a lot of it. The vietnamese soup is served in a BUCKET. Way too much. If you finish it be careful turning corners because the sloshing is likely to throw your balance off. It shouldn't be humanly possible to eat that much soup. 
Great value. Cheap Cheap Cheap! Lunch for under $10 and you could get out of there in under 20 mins.

The funny thing is the speed at which your food comes out. I always tell people that the waitress will walk away and return with your meal in under 2 minutes. Always great, always quick. Love this place."}
{"text":"Been coming here for their roti and curry brisket for years!!! Has not changed one bit! Still amazing still delicious still the same price!"}
{"text":"I can't really say much other than my all-time favourite place to grab some awesome curry... I could eat the chicken curry every bloody day if possible!

Nice, quaint, clean little place in the plaza on the hill by Leslie/16th avenue, everything seems to be freshly made as well. I'd pay just to sit here and smell the air"}
{"text":"Just a few quick notes before the food part of the review. It's World Cup time and the servers were very preoccupied with trying to get the game on the tv. You have to ask for napkins. Compared to other Asian restaurants the service here IMO is slightly worse. They don't have a big restaurant but the service is slow so it makes it harder to overlook. 

I came here with my partner and her parents. My partner got the pig feet soup, which from my guess was their version of Bun Bo Hue. Obviously I couldn't tell because the menu is in English and Chinese and didn't obviously say Bun Bo Hue. I got the oxtail soup. First the \"Bun Bo Hue\" the soup was basically spiced water. The broth didn't retain any of the flavour of tomato that a traditional soup should have. But if we're saying it's not Bun Bo Hue the soup is still on the thin side as the flavour of spice is the only thing that you taste. 

My oxtail soup was significantly better. The flavour of the spicy blends well with the lemon grass and creates a more complex and pleasing flavours. The oxtail is tough but is sliced thin so that you're not trying to gnaw on a huge tough piece of meat. 

My overall impression is that the food is decent but not anything that's going to impress you or make you come back unless it's convenient. We got other food like spring rolls and chicken wings as well but I feel like the contrast between my partners and my noodle dish highlights the inconsistencies of the restaurant. 

Unfortunately this restaurant's food would not bring me back and the service is what it is."}
{"text":"The pad thai at Green Lemon Grass was so dank that I'd cut off my right hand to have another taste. Do not listen to the review in which the restaurant was described as being \"ghetto\"."}
{"text":"Not my go-to choice when it comes to cuisine, but the restaurant we wanted to come to was super full with a long wait, so we came here instead.

Unique decor reminiscent of the cuisine is seen here, but things do seem a little old school. Cell service is probably the best at this restaurant as it is more open than the other restaurants in the plaza. 

The food is about as good as you can get elsewhere. My family got House Special Beef Noodle Soup, and I got the Lemon Grass Pork Chop Rice. I would say the food overall is okay, absolutely nothing special about it. 

Service was quite good though, as the staff were quick on their feet and accommodating. 

Probably not my top pick to come for a meal, but wouldn't mind coming back if no other choices were given."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Pho and Curry.  Whether it's a cold winter day or I'm sick as a dog with the flu, I can always count on this place making pho that will hit the spot.  

I usually order the Large Rare Beef Pho.  Broth is flavorful and light.  A good portion of meat and noodles in every bowl they make.  Comes with bean sprouts, basil and lime on the side.  They will usually ask if you want your bean sprouts raw or cooked.  Sometimes they may not have bean sprouts if you go early, before 12 pm since that's when they usually get their delivery.

Other things I recommend, Lemon Grass Chicken, Laksa, Beef Brisket Curry with Roti, Spring Rolls and Pineapple Fried Rice.

Service is relatively quick, not a big restaurant as maximum capacity is about 50 so I don't recommend groups of more than 4."}
{"text":"Best curry sauce in GTA.    95% of the time I would order curry beef rice or roti. 
It's has a lot of flavor besides just curry.   The menu say it's Malaysian curry.
If you like curry, you should try it.

Removed 1 star because few times I went at 8:30 PM, the chef has stop cooking even though the restaurant closes at 9 PM.   And a couple of times, the curry sauce wasn't up to their usually standard (ie. the sauce wasn't thick enough or it didn't have that Malaysian curry flavor)"}
{"text":"My friends eat out a fair bit. Some might even say too much. So when it comes to reliable choices for post gym, hearty, heart warming food, I feel plenty comfortable blindly following them anywhere. Yesterday, that meant a quick lunch stop at Green Lemon Grass.

Green Lemon Grass is a small South East Asian restaurant located in a building within which there there are several other restaurants. We went on a holiday afternoon, and were lucky enough to nab the last couple of available seats. I doubt making reservations here is an option, but that being said, I doubt that you would have to wait too long if you stop by.

Hopefully they serve plenty of other good stuff, but we went purely for the curry. I couldn't tell you what the specific name is of the dish that I had, but it was probably something like pork roti with curry. The dish is pretty simple. You'll be served a warm curry with relatively no spicy heat, (which isn't a bad thing), and a several pieces of roti that sandwich pork bits, and what I assume is some sort of egg mixture. On on top of being simple in composition, the dish is relatively simple flavour wise. But don't get me wrong; simple flavours done well are often all you need for a filling meal. For under $9, you'll enjoy the freshly baked roti, and a curry recipe that they obviously have confidence in, since all the other curry dishes on the table had the same base.

Upon leaving, I was plenty satisfied. Aside from wanting some more elbow room and access to the restaurant's bathroom instead of the one down the hall, I can't complain. The food certainly won't knock your socks off, but you'll be happy."}
{"text":"Like the name implies, this place serves up a few dishes from here and there across south-east Asia. Reminds me of eating through Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam. 

Tried a Vietnamese noodle (spicy beef rice noodle soup, Bun Bo Hue) and a curry with Roti -- both are very good. 

I deducted one star for not having Singaporean pepper crab or curry crab, or curry fish head soup. Not enough Thai dishes either."}
{"text":"I'm personally not too big on pho but this place is alright, the portions are large and the food is okay. I wouldn't mind coming back. I liked that the pho noodles were thin and had a nice chewy texture to it but I thought that the rice and grilled meat dish was just mediocre. Overall, it seems that this business is doing well because of the plethora of guests waiting for seats during lunch hours."}
{"text":"Surprised! And will definitely come back! 

I have known about the Richlane plaza for awhile but never really dabbled into the food. I went on a very late night and was very hungry. They are quick with what they make. I ordered the fried chicken rice which was remarkable. One of the best rice dishes I have had in a very long time. The nuttiness and the herbs as well as the way it's grilled and fried made the chicken rice dish an excellent choice for me. It was rich in flavour and very filling. It was only eight dollars. I also got true spicy peanut and beef noodle which was another flavourful adventure. It was not too spicy but another heart warming dish with various spices. I was also surprised to find pineapple inside. Reminds me of a Thai dish. Overall very satisfying dishes both for eight dollars which usually out in downtown portion and ingredient wise would definitely cost you more."}
{"text":"I used to come here for pho normally since it is close to my house. Food came quickly and was delicious. However I stopped coming here after finding a fly in my pho."}
{"text":"Portions here are HUGE! It's normally pretty crowded - and I get why because the quality and quantity of food is pretty great for the price you're paying. My favourites are the beef brisket with roti and the lemongrass chicken/pork on rice! Their pho is great as well!"}
{"text":"Shortly after I received my order of Shredded Chicken with Sausage Pho Noodle in Soup, the same server came back to inform us that they didn't have enough fresh pho noodles to cook for my mom's portion of pho and asked if she wanted to vermicelli instead.  Um, vermicelli is not the same type of noodles as pho at all and curry would have been ideal with pho so that it could soak up the sauciness...  So, no, of course my mom didn't want vermicelli with the curry chicken.  The server asked if she wanted the dry pho noodles and since my mom doesn't like the taste of dry pho (fresh pho tastes better for her), she decided to forgo the order entirely.

Anyway, my order of Shredded Chicken with Sausage Pho Noodle in Soup was so-so.  First, I liked that the broth was tasty and steaming hot.  Hot pho soup broth is so important.  The shredded chicken were tender.  The pho noodles were decent.  However, the Vietnamese sausage was cut too thick and didn't taste good at all.  I have fond memories of eating Vietnamese sausage in soup noodles that are almost always delicious.  This one was really disappointing based on it being so thick and kind of flavourless."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on Yelp and the photos convinced me to bring my family here. We were very pleased with the food and would go back again and watch out as the portions are very big!

We ordered:

-satay beef noodle soup: very savoury, lots of beef slices very tender and fresh, lots of peanuts. 

-beef curry with roti: a few potato cubes and the entire bowl was filled with lots of beef. Do watch out though as some of the thicker pieces of beef were not fully cooked where it was real pink and I could t eat it while being pregnant. Flavour was very authentic curry. 

-chicken and beef satay skewers: chicken very tender, beef cooked to medium so again I wasn't able to eat it while being pregnant but both were flavourful with hint of curry/satay. 

-pineapple fried rice: my husband loves to order this dish wherever he goes and he was very happy with it. There were bits of peanuts, shrimps, chicken and flavourful. 

Definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to have Vietnamese food and has a big appetite as their portions are so huge."}
{"text":"Located by Leslie and 16th, this place wasn't too hard to find. The restaurant is inside a little chinese plaza. I really liked how the restaurant was open concept. There were no windows or pillars that blocked the outside view of the plaza. The only issue I have with that is people that are walking the plaza can watch you eat.

The food was good, but nothing to rave about. The soup in my Pho tasted like the pre-made soup cubes that you can find in chinese supermarkets. I wasn't expecting much, as this is my second time coming here. My coworkers got the lemon grass chicken with rice. Like the Pho, it was nothing to rave about. The chicken tasted bland, even with the fish sauce added. There wasn't enough garlic in both the chicken or the sauce, so that was a disappointment. But the food certainly LOOKED good! :)

Service was.. sub par, but passable. Lady was extremely friendly, which is why I gave 3 stars instead of two.

Don't take up my review and not try this place, though. There is definitely potential in their other foods, so make sure you try other dishes too. I come here bc it's a minute away from work, when I don't feel like driving. If I had a choice, I'd go to Kim Bo on hwy 7/leslie or Vic Hong on Bayview and major mac."}
{"text":"This is the place I always have cravings for.  My favourite is their House Special Fried Rice followed by their Curry Duo with your choice of rice or roti.  Although the inside does not look appealing but the taste, the portion of the food and the price kept me coming back for more.  During the winter I like to have their pho.  It is good for two."}
{"text":"Food is ok... but service is terrible! The waitress, could be the owner, seen just want to leave before their closing time. They suppose close at 10 but mopping with the stronge bleach around you when you eating half hour before they close! No matter how good the food they make, is no way you could finish. Anyway, I won't back there for sure."}
{"text":"my go-to for viet food in richmond hill... best pho in town .. something ppl dnt know is that the owners split off from kim po and founded this place... kim po got more expensive while this place stayed cheaper for a while... now they are about the same price ... this place still gives larger portions than kim po and better quality imo ... big fan of the curry and vermicelli dishes as well"}
{"text":"My Fiance ordered a Tom Yum soup with no flavor and my pho tasted like regular broth from a can. I didn't expect good service and was right. They don't accept credit cards and you have to pay at the front. Not a place worth trying!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Very affordable! One of the best Oriental food places I have ever been to in GTA. Strongly recommenxed."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located inside an enclosed mall and the stores/ restaurants here close early. So do not be surprised if you find this mall a bit deserted on weeknights.  

I came here after my friend gave us the recommendation.  I had the pho special large.  The soup broth is flavourful and noodles were good.  The pho here isn't bad and I consider it to be one of the better ones in Markham.  

If you ever have a craving for pho.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Been here for lunch at least 50 times with my coworkers. Satay soup and Pad Thai are awesome..."}
{"text":"Been coming to Lemon Grass for about 5 years: good food, kitchen works quickly, generous entree portions (I seldom order side dishes) and I know I can expect decent service every time I come here.  

Vietnamese pho is on target but their Laksa is not Singapore style. The Hainanese Chicken Rice is closer but still not quite the same if you are searching for the authentic Singapore version. That said, the spring onion-ginger mix that comes with the dish is sooo fragrant. Goes perfectly with the chicken but I can eat it with absolutely anything. Hmm... I think I can even eat it straight!"}
{"text":"My mom and I came here for lunch.  I swear I've had the same food at metro square at the curry spot, they both looked, smelled and tasted alike.  Anyways I ordered the curry lamb and my mom ordered the oxtail noodle soup.  They were both full of flavour.  The service was great too, they got the food out quick on a packed lunchtime.  I'd go back here for sure and recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick dinner. This place is actually always packed whenever I pass by it so I assume the pho must be good. I wasn't really feeling for pho so I got the Laksa Noodle Soup. I have never tried Laksa Noodles before so this was my first and not gonna lie, it's not too bad. Would I get it again? Maybe not. It's essentially just like a curry broth with a few shrimps & vietnamese sausage slices and two different kinds of noodles; some sort of thick egg noodle and vermicelli? Taste is not bad. I'm not really a fan of curry anymore so when I first put it in my mouth I was like aww...bummer. Noodles were fine; they were cooked just right. The shrimps and sausages were...questionable. Not a huge fan of them...(I LOVE BOTH SO YOU KNOW ITS SAD AF) 

Place is a little dirty looking LOOL SORRY BUT everything looks bleh. Our table was covered with water stains and other oily liquids. And the placement of one of the tables is like wtf? It's literally next to the hole where they bring out the food...like what if your hands slipped and it spilled on the customer? :/"}
{"text":"This place was packed on a Sunday evening and I was shocked due to the long wait. Considering this small mall was all about foods, i think there's only 5 or 6 restaurants here but this mall the only one that was packed lining up.

Having said that, we finally got a table after a half hr wait...we ordered the infamous curry, beef broth noodles, spring rolls and some appetizers.

Overall, the price is considerably good for the portion and taste. The curry was spicy enough but slightly lacking fragrance in my opinion.

We ordered a big bowl of pho and that was just average, it didn't have enough flavour for the soup base. It wasn't bold enough, considering the fact that thr soup base is one of the most important items in the pho...

All in all,  a place I would come back but may not drive out of the way to come..."}
{"text":"A local pho shop with good flavors and filling portions for cost. There's nothing very unique about it, but also nothing offensive. The pho has a good bite and the soup base works well with the various oyster and hot sauces available for consumption. When you're here, try out the laksa or curry roti if you're looking for something different from pho."}
{"text":"This place has delicious thick curry with huge chunks of beef brisket, unlike other restaurants that serve you water down curry and tiny morsel of beef. The roti is huge and is definitely enough to fill you up. Crispy on the outside and tender in the inside. The ice coffee is nice and strong and the ice didn't water down the flavour. Will be coming back again when I'm craving Malaysian curry."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by this restaurant's shabby appearance.   I will admit, I wasn't too captivated by the interior; lighting was dim, seating looked a little cramped and the table tops looked a bit dirty.  However, the food made up for this!   

I have always loved curry but was never able to handle the spiciness.  Not only was the curry here flavourful but it was mildly spicy, something I was able to handle with ease.   I ordered the curry beef brisket roti; there were generous amounts of brisket and the brisket was juicy and tender.  Was a little on the pricier side ($13.95), but I left feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"Excellent beef pho, service was fast."}
{"text":"The curry lamb was flavourful tender and true to the menu rating wasn't too spicy. It could have been more hot (as in heat) but I like my food piping hot.  The spicy beef noodle soup wasn't good at all. This is the first time I've ever seen my husband not eat his meal bc he didn't like it.  I think it was the anise but it just lacked flavour.   I'd give it resto 3.5 but since I can't do half stars IL give it a 4.  I liked my lamb and the service was attentive and fast plus we will come again to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night. This place seems pretty busy but turn over rate is quite high which is good since we only waited 10 mins for a table for 3.

The menu is considered limited, as the there's only one side of the menu and there's only a few selection in each category. 

We ordered a small spicy house pho, and 2 large house pho. Within minutes of placing our order, food came. It was the quickest pho place I have ever been to! Either because the restaurant wasn't super busy at that time (7:15pm, Friday night) or everything is premade accelerating service speed.

They gave us a small dish of bean sprouts, limes and bayleaf. You can always ask for more if you want and we did since one small dish isn't quite enough to share between 3 people. 

The sizing of the noodles were quite weird, we ordered 2 larges, but one came in a large bowl and one came in a smaller bowl, making us feel like one was a small and the other a large. The amount of food which were in both bowls looked the same, I guess maybe they ran out of the same size of bowls!?

The spicy house pho had and tasted exactly the same as the house pho just with some red, hot chilli oil in it, nothing too amazing about it.

Service was average, basically minimal and didn't pay much attention to not only our table but other tables in general. If you needed something, you basically raise your hand or attention.

The soup tasted good, but I figured out why very shortly after drinking almost half the bowl. It was FULL of MSG!! For the remaining of the night, all 3 of us felt SOOOO thirsty! I kept drinking water until my stomach wanted to explode and yet I still feel thirsty! I can't imagine how much MSG they put into that soup!!

MSG is a HUGE TURNOFF for me in foods! If you don't have the ability to make good food without adding so much crap and junk into it, then please don't trick all customers and making their body suffer!

Pricing I would consider to be average, around $8 - $9 for a small and $1 or $2 for large. 

But I wouldn't recommend this place to any of my friends/family and WOULDN'T be a choice to come back!"}
{"text":"Place is very busy during lunch and dinner but it's a quick service so not really like you need to wait forever. The food was average. I enjoyed the curry dishes but mostly i look forward to eating bun at Viet places (vermicelli and veggies with random meat toppings to choose from). This place didn't really fulfill my expectations of the noodles dishes. I ordered the chicken dish which should have a skewered meat and they gave me twice the grilled chicken and just told me they forgot the skewer so here's the chicken... But other tables were getting their skewers after... Made no sense.. the food tasted average, though their fish sauce was delicious and I'm a huge fish sauce fan :)

It was really messy there and the sauce holders were all covered in caked on spills which just really makes you not want to use it.. they seated us right next to the food window thing which was extremely annoying cause they just kept brushing right next to me with all these hot dishes. They really should not seat people there. Plus they kept screaming at each other through the window.

Honestly no real desire to come back. I've had better Viet in Markham at better prices."}
{"text":"Do you like curry,  pho and asian naan bread? Well if you haven't tried this restaurant then you definitely need to add it to your list. 

Whenever I have a bit more time and not in a rush I like to drop by and grab a bite at this restaurant. I wouldn't say their located in a difficult place to get to but its not a quick in and out restaurant. But for that extra little wait the food is worth it. 

If you come on weekends you will often see a line up outside. Today we had satay beef Noodle, traditional viet beef Noodle soup and pork chop on rice. All of them tasted great, the noodles were cooked just about right and the portion sizes are decent. We took half of two dishes home. For around $12 a person tax and tip in you are guaranteed to be full. 

We will be back again in a couple months. Till then stay warm Toronto"}
{"text":"Food 2.5 stars.  Services plus portion +0.5 star.  Overall 3 stars.

Average soup noodles, insane portion is the synopsis.  We ordered 2 small noodles.  The portion was close to the medium sized bowl of other Vietnamese noodle places.  Together they could feed 3 people.  The broth of the Shredded Chicken Rice Noodle Soup was clear, and bland.  The Spicy Beef Rice Noodle Soup was not spicy whatsoever.  I added chili sauce.  

The services was considerate and effective.  We ordered a Stirred Fried Chinese Broccoli with Salted Fish.  We asked to substitute Chinese broccoli with Chinese green, since the broccoli was too tough for my mom to chew.  Not only there was no issue, the waitress voluntarily suggested to instruct the kitchen to make the Chinese green extra soft."}
{"text":"Opened by Cantonese people. Food was just okay. We ordered Vietnamese beef noodle soup. My bf said beef was not very fresh so he just ate noodle. Fish cakes were mostly made my flour and deep fired. I had curry chicken which was fine. Service was extremely bad. Waitress have an extremely strong accent and was rude and impatience. I won't say I will go back there again. Cuz  you can have those kind of quality food  every where in town."}
{"text":"A nice simple Viet restaurant in a small food mall.  Great for all, friends and family.  They have a wide variety of items on their menu, my favourite is the chicken pho and the chicken mong.  The chicken and beef curry is also very good."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times already and I always get the same things! Can't go wrong with the curry beef brisket roti, laksa noodles or the house special noodles."}
{"text":"I like how this place was designed. If you get a window seat it feels like you are eating outside. There is no actual glass so you can hop over if you wanted to. 

#03 chicken/beef skewers @ $10.50 total 6 skewers - by far some of the largest portion skewers I've had but lacked in flavor and tenderness when compared to other restaurants like Thai Basil. Peanut sauce also lacked in flavor.

#16 chicken roti (I think it was $12.95) - once again pretty big portions but the sauce is missing the sweet coconut flavor that I like and the chicken meat was almost melting of the bone like it was sitting for a while. Also if adding extra roti its around $6 and they give you extra sauce in a bowl. A bit pricy for extra roti and the extra sauce was not even needed.

#41 fried noodles with shrimp and chicken meat( I think it was $9.95)  - a fairly simple dish that was done well.

#76 beef brisket in curry sauce with rice (I think was $12.95) - same curry sauce that came with the chicken roti. The beef was tender but not fall off the bone quality and once again the curry sauce is lacking in flavor."}
{"text":"Prices are pretty average for a Vietnamese restaurant in the GTA area. Their pho noodle soup is really good. If you are looking to eat pho in the Markham/Richmond Hill area, I recommend this place. All the dishes I have tried here are generally pretty good - Lemon Grass Chicken, Curry Chicken with Roti, Spring Rolls etc. The food comes really quick if you go right before the dinner rush so around 5-6 pm. Everything about this place is awesome except for one thing - their washrooms are not clean and not maintained well."}
{"text":"Lunch with colleagues, group of 9. Place is always busy so need to call for reservation. Frequent this place before but find it dirty this visit. The glass of water served has some leftover food sticking on the inside, service tea has floating bubbles, is it soap? Yayks! 

Servers could a add a smile or a friendlier feel 

Foodwise is ok. Ordered phad thai and lemongrass chicken wings. Both are not bad but nothing really stands out. 

Weird that their machine charge $. 25 surcharge fee for debit after adding the amount and tip.  Also they charge you extra for take out containers!"}
{"text":"Alright first things first, I always go to Pho 88 near bamburgh circle just because its been close to me forever and this was probably the first time where I ventured out to somewhere else far and have to admit, totally worth it!

At first my friend told me it was like in a plaza, and it looked like crap from the outside looking in but got damn, they are good and fast.

Large House Special Pho was dope! Only bad thing is that they have no cold air/ventilation in the restaurant... but other than that for $8.95, can't miss out on this deal!

Next time if I do visit, I will probably try other dishes, but its good!"}
{"text":"I gave this place 5 stars because it has what I care about:
-amazing food (SO DELICIOUS)
-very reasonable pricing
-fast service

No, the place is not fancy
No, i wouldn't suggest coming here on a first date
No, it's not glamorous
No, they don't offer a 4 page menu

BUT, the food is really delicious and the prices are quite cheap

The pad thai here is some of the best I've ever had; the perfect amount of sauce and it is VERY tasty
We also always get the fried beef with lemon grass; \"Fried\" to them means stir fried not deep fried
This is some of the best beef I've ever had, any where
Very tasty, juicy and great
For under $8, you get a plate of beef and steamed rice and a small side of pickled veggies ... (I think a McDonald's big mac meal costs more than that)
I also really like the beef satay soup; a great mix of noodles, beef, thai herbs and peanuts; nice broth too

My family and I always enjoy it here
And usually have leftovers for the next day
And it usually ends up costs $10-$15 a person

You can't go wrong
(it's in a mall - Richlane Plaza I think it's called)"}
{"text":"We ordered: 
-fried chicken vermicelli (8.95) 
-chicken curry roti (12.95) 

This place is okay. The price is too high though. Better curry and wayy better roti at Gourmet Malaysia for a better price. There was a big chunk of coconut undissolved in the curry. The chicken was nice and tender. The roti didn't have that baked goodness on both sides, only one side was baked. The flavour and freshness wasn't there. The vermicelli is bun, I got confused and thought I was getting chinese vermicelli (soup noodles) since they were serving fusion of items inclusing curry and pho lol, but oh well. Flavour of that dish was not bad. Nothing I would come back for. Can't believe they charge for takeout containers... and they don't take credit card. Atmisphere is like a food court - wall is not closed so you can hear everything from the hall outside the restaurant in the mall... and there happened to be 2 small undisciplined children hooting and hollering. All I want for Toronto is adult-only restaurants..."}
{"text":"Located in the Richlane Plaza, Green Lemon Grass serves mostly Vietnamese, Thai and other South East Asian dishes.  The menu is actually quite extensive and covers a variety of dishes from noodles, rice, curries amongst others.

I ended up getting the large Pho special which was the sliced rare and well done beef, tripe, tendon and meat balls.   The broth was good and flavourful but didn't really stand out.   The tendon was underdone and a bit too chewy for my taste.  

Some of the other dishes that people ordered looked pretty good so wouldn't mind trying them out next time.

It does get busy during lunch and dinner time but food comes out fast so turnover is high.  A pretty good option if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Got rare beef noodle soup and spring roll.  Soup base tasted oily. Not amazing yummy. Beef was all stuck together and soup was not hot enough to cook beef through. and we all love a gd piping soup! Spring roll was good! And it came with white noodle.  But not worth 5.50. Roll was slightly smaller with just two pieces. Very nice and crispy. Flavourful inside too. Would come back only for their other foods. lots of choice there. ie. pad thai"}
{"text":"This was a standard place not much was special about it. 

I got the small pho and was pleasantly surprised with the broth but that was pretty much it. As for the curry, the sauce had a lot of flavor but the brisket and the potato lacked flavor."}
{"text":"We were here a couple times before for dining in. Today we decided to take out. We ordered at 7:14 and it took forever and we are still waiting at 7:59. I went to asked if the food was ready. And the staff purposely said was because we didn't give tips so I could hear their conversation, hinting for us to give tips. LOL. Are we obligated to give tips for take out when you purposely tell us to give tips?

When we got home....We realized the chicken was not very fresh and the vegetable dish we order was so tiny in terms of portion....."}
{"text":"Visited here a couple weeks ago, because I passed by and smelled the curry, it smelled really good.

Sat down and ordered a Malaysian chicken curry with Naan and a side of rice.

The curry was average, smelled better than it tasted. The potato was mostly melted into the curry already, and the Naan was too thick and moist.  Service wise.. there was only 1 person manning the entire restaurant, not that it's really big, but there were 5 tables at the time, so service wasn't the greatest either.

Doubt I will come back again."}
{"text":"I'm literally the biggest fan of pho.  If you look at all my other reviews or even go onto my IG food page, I post 80% pho restaurants.  

However, HERE at Green Lemon Grass, I always get the satay beef noodles.  I don't understand how anything can be soooo good.  It's so perfectly spicy but unspicy, there's so much noodles and beef.  I don't even care if it's a cold day or not, I can eat this in like scorching heat and still be happy.

The pho here is not bad either.  The broth doesn't seem 100% legit viet, but I have had worst and the portions here are supreme for the prices.

The curry beef brisket rice is a literal game changer.  They give you this giant ass bowl of the curry and beef separate from the rice and it's sooo creamy and delicious.

HOWEVER, do not order the chicken skewers.  They came right when I was about to pay the bill and I didn't want to ask them to take it back ... they were sooo dry and tasted a little funky.  Pass.

I haven't been back in a while and I'm kicking myself for it.  When Winter comes, I am going to be supporting this place like no other."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing! The goat curry is my all time favorite. I would recommend to get takeout instead of eating in because it is a small restaurant and is a little worn down. I wouldn't recommend this  restaurant for someone who is looking for something fancy though."}
{"text":"When I am craving vietnamese food, I think of this restaurant...but every time I come here I am DISAPPOINTED. 

Their curry and soup bases are very flavourful and tasty (and I guess that's what keeps drawing me back to them)...but every time I come here their BEEF is IMPOSSIBLE to chew. This time was the absolute worse. None of us could even BITE into the beef. It was like chewing rubber. We ordered the pho and the curry noodles which both had beef slices in them -- NONE of the slices were consumed. It SUCKED. When we told the waitress about this, she said \"oh\"...then walked away. She later came back and offered chicken but we declined -- we've become skeptical of the quality of their meats.

We also ordered their curry minced beef roti. It looked quite tasty but the roti (which was supposed to have minced beef in it) had mostly eggs and a pinch of beef. It was weird....I was expecting to dip my roti in curry but it ended up tasting/feeling like dipping scrambled egg in curry. 

I really don't want to come back here anymore (But this is not a promise). Their soups/curries are good but everything else sucks....my tastebuds feel conflicted!"}
{"text":"You will be really surprise how busy this place can be during lunch hour.

They specialized in Vietnamese beef soup noodle and curry. I always order either the small size Tom Yum beef noodle soup or if I have 2 person then we will share a medium size. The broth is really favoured, not salty. Their small size is equal to a medium at other restaurants. 

Service is fast and prompt! And the price is great!

BTW, no lunch special... is the same menu for the whole day...

Please don't sit near the little opening where the wait staff pick up the food. You will have a view of the kitchen..(which I prefer not to see).

CASH only!"}
{"text":"My colleagues brought me there and it's a good place for curry stuff at such reasonable price. Paying 8 dollars you will get a big bowl of curry beef and you can finish the rice easily with the curry soup. Big, Yummy and good price"}
{"text":"This place was recently renovated, but it's still casual and small. Service was fast and courteous. The food was delicious. I really enjoyed their roti and curries that come in large bowls. We ordered:

Belachan Shrimp and Green Beans (soft, well cooked, tasty)
Spring Rolls (yum!)
Roti Canai (a little more oily than I like, but it's Roti!)
Curry Minced Chicken Roti (tasty, spicier than the other curry dish we ordered)
Malaysian Curry Beef Brisket (very tasty)
BBQ Chicken and Spring Roll Vermicelli (I'm not usually a vermicelli fan, but this was tasty mixed with the curry)

We came here on a Wednesday night with a group of 4 and there was no wait. We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Overall 3.5 stars.
We came here for dinner with family. This place gets really busy during dinner rush; had to wait a while for a table. 
We ordered a number of dishes to share. Portions were large.
- Curry beef brisket roti: this was one of the fav dishes of the night, even my little nieces loved it. Roti was nice and fluffy and not overly greasy; we had to order a second roti. The curry was a bit too salty for my liking, but everyone else liked it.

- Spicy beef rice noodles (Bun Bo Hue). This is a popular Viet noodle soup. I am Viet and found that the noodle wasn't quite authentic. I wouldn't get this again.
 
- Beef satay noodle soup; beef satay served with soft Pho noodles and peanut. I enjoyed this, very flavourful and I loved the Pho noodles. The small size is quite large.

- Pad Thai: comes with shrimps and chicken; decent portion. It was just alright, not bad but not amazing. Very average pad Thai.

- Pineapple fried rice, comes with shrimps and  little chunks of grilled lemon grass flavoured chicken. Fried rice was quite tasty but the little chunks of pineapple could have blended in a little better. We did enjoy this dish.

Overall, decent food, large portion, affordable prices, service is typical asian standard (which means don't expect much service). I would come back"}
{"text":"I ordered the rare beef pho and roti with goat.  The pho was nice, lots of variety of beef (beef, tripe, beef ball).  The soup was not overly salty.  The roti with goat is something I don't see too often in other vietnamese restaurants and every table seemed to order it.  The roti was a bit greasy but the portions were generous.  The goat itself was easy to chew on and the curry sauce was thick but nice.  The service was great and food came quickly (less than 10mins?).  I'd come back if I'm feeling for something different from typical Vietnamese restaurants."}
