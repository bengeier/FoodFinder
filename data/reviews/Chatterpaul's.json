{"text":"I went for my first visit Saturday afternoon.  They are not usually open until 3:00 on a Saturday but they made a special concession as we were celebrating the 20th anniversary of friends.  All the wait staff were very gracious and helpful.  We had a varied menu of which I enjoyed the Caesar salad as appetizer, followed by an incredibly tender lamb shank as main.  Dessert was Creme Brulee - amazing.  Thank you one and all for a wonderful experience"}
{"text":"Went there on a restrictive diet and gave all my nuisance instructions (no butter, starchy veggies, etc). One of the wait staff told me that even their creamy sauces were good - made with coconut milk. Ended up having the mahi mahi, blackened and herb crusted, on a bed of greens (broccolini and snow peas). Sounds boring but the chef killed it! It was sooooo good. Couldn't get a table for 2 hours so we sat at the bar instead, by the computer, where the service staff enters orders for the kitchen. All of the staff engaged us without being intrusive or too personal. They were very polite and friendly. Apparently this place has a full house on most nights of the week, including Mondays and Tuesdays, which to me, speaks volumes. In most Durham restaurants the staff can hardly dress themselves. This is a whole different world when you walk in. The only place worth going to in Durham."}
{"text":"Best place around! We have been to Chatterpauls many times for various occasions and with various sizes groups (from 2 to 12) and have never left disappointed. The food is fantastic, no matter what you choose and the service is second to none.  On par with a high end downtown TO restaurant but without the drive. I would recommend Chatterpauls to anyone."}
{"text":"This place reminds of 'The Keg', but in Whitby! The food price here is good, and the portions are good as well.  Apps: Spicy Calamari - $15.95 -Simmered in plum tomato Cajun broth. - This tasted alright, not the greatest.  Shirley's Shrimp & Lobster Bisque - $10.95 -Creamy, lobster-infused, tiger shrimp, lobster meat. - Two mid-size shrimp, with a slice of lobster meat on top. - Tasted fine, a bit thick. They pour the soup for you as presentation.  Coco's & Crabcake - $18.95 -Coconut crusted tiger shrimp & crispy \"Chattercake\" on lobster influenced cream sauce. - This is the best app out of the bunch. The cakes were tasty, coming in two, and two shrimps.  Entrees: Flat Iron & Tail $37.95 rock lobster tail mounted on an 8oz flat iron steak (served med-rare) with a peppercorn, rosemary reduction and drawn butter over mash. - I was quite satisfied with this meal. I'd say this is not the flat iron I was use to eating as it was not as lean, and this was thicker, but it was still cooked right at medium for me.  Arctic Char $29.95 oven baked Arctic Char over Portobello mushroom ravioli in a pool of dill infused lobster cream. - My gf enjoyed her dish. I thought its quite a bit to pay for fish.  My bro and fellow friends got the pasta with seafood which was really good portion and the seafood portion was generous. I'd say the highlight was how surprisingly big the tiger shrimps were...  The disappointment dish I'd say were the lamb that my friend got for $39! Overall, our server was very friendly and attentive, as it was not as busy. This place is a must try in Whitby!"}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place. Food was great, menu had a good selection, seating was comfortable and quiet enough to have a conversation. The service was friendly and never rushed or delayed. Higher than an average dinner price but worth it."}
{"text":"Love it. 4.5 stars. Food is fantastic. Typical higher price smaller portion fancy restaurant but the food quality is great. Service was good, so was the atmosphere, very nice. I left full regardless. Banana bread cheesecake is WOAH, so is the lamb shank and lobster bisque. Didn't love my rainbow trout because my wife's lamb tasted better lol"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and am really impressed. I most recently had the seabass over mushroom ravioli with a lobster cream sauce. My business associates, also particular about food, had the Chatter Ribs, which looked like a giant roast on a bone but was tender and lean. We also had the ribeye at the table and it was a generous size, with lobster mac and cheese. This is our go-to place in Whitby. Not on the cheap side - each entree was $35, but they do have Mill St Organic beer on tap."}
{"text":"Very friendly, but overpriced-very much so for the portions given- and service can be spotty. You can see what they are trying to be - a fine dining restaurant with a unique flavor - but they don't quite hit the mark. You get a decent meal, but Whitby has tons better at less cost."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Durham - the food is consistently excellent.  After testing against hundreds of other restaurants, the Chatterpaul's Ceasar still reigns supreme.  The service is as good as the food, and the Banana cheesecake is awesome."}
{"text":"Probably the most delicious food that I've had at a restaurant. Everything had a lot of flavour and the atmosphere was very inviting and positive. The staff were very knowledgable about the menu and were able to help. The owner had come up to the table during our meal to welcome us since it was the first time we had gone. The only downside it most days you need a reservation to get a table. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Have come here on several occasions when traveling.  Consistently good food, especially for what else is in the area.  If you are looking for something other than a steakhouse I would definitely recommend CP's.  Lamb shank and duck are ably prepared and the amouse-bouche is a welcome change from the standard bread and butter.   It is a bit pricey for the area but on par if you are from a more populous  area.  Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"This is really as good as it gets. Only had lunch there but service was great and food was even better. Looking forward to trying dinner but expectations are already set high. It has instantly become one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to chatterpauls for our anniversary. We both found the staff to be extremely professional and the waiters are obviously career restaurant staff and not transient. We started with an amazing amuse-bouche which was curried lamb. We split the lobster bisque which was incredibly tasty with two large shrimp and lobster pieces. My wife had to 10 ounce steak and loved it. I tried it and thought it was very good. The presentation was fantastic with rapini shredded carrots and a mash potato that's probably the best I've tried. I tried the jerk pork chops. I had expected it to be very spicy but found very little heat at all. That said it was still easily the best pork chops I've ever had because it was incredibly tender and flavorful. Our waiter suggested the Petite Syrah from California and it paired nicely with everything. We finished it off with the chocolate cake which was fantastic. They also offered us a smaller creme brulee which is to die for. The only reason I did not give the restaurant 5 stars is because I am comparing it against what I believe are five star restaurants in Toronto. That being said chatterpauls is undoubtedly the best restaurant in Whitby if not the Durham region."}
{"text":"I give 4 Stars because is a restaurant in Durham. Probably one of the most refine in the area where chains restaurants reigns. This is the reason why a reservation is highly recommended. Probably not the same if it was in Toronto. The food is good and so the service. Maybe a little overpriced."}
{"text":"Mahi Mahi..the fish was dry and over cooked. Crab cake bland. Dessert cream brullee was cold and lumpy..couldn't eat it.  Huge disappointment was this dining experience."}
{"text":"We repeatedly visit this place. Amazing food every time and I love how intimate it is. We've never waited once to be seated (you are best to make a reservation)."}
{"text":"Went here a little while back with by besties and had the most pleasant experience. The environment is so welcoming and clean, the service was fantastic and the food! My goodness, where can I start? The cedar planked Brie was perfect and the duck breast over the ravioli was mouth watering. I can't wait for the next time, I would love to try everything on their well built menu. This is exactly what Whitby needs as far as quality, class and creativity with menu options! Great job! I can be close to home but feel like I have travelled far and away to explore some of the exotic options on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food , Great atmosphere and Great Service. Try the Banana Cheesecake!!!. You can't go wrong with this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is now my favourite restaurant. The food amazing! The service amazing!  We went for our anniversary and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Me and my girls came here for our secret santa exchange. You'd never expect in this strip mall that you'd find a gem like this place. The ambiance is nice but a bit outdated. Our waitress was extremely nice and pleasant. She made us feel very welcomed. The one thing about the menu that I didn't like was that there were too many seafood options, especially for the appetizers and amuse bouche. I don't eat any seafood so this kind of sucked. I ordered the beef rib and it was perfect. It melted in my mouth and was spiced perfectly. For the price it was a huge rib which was definitely worth it. For dessert we shared the creme brulee and mousse explosion cake. Wasn't a huge fan of the cake but the creme brulee was absolutely delicious. I would definitely come back and try the jerk chicken and chicken parm."}
{"text":"I left downtown years ago and was happy to find a restaurant on par with the city options out in the burbs! Actually had my wedding reception here! They're were able to accommodate out small party of 40 with ease. Food was great, and everyone was quite surprised by the quality of food coming from this 'strip mall restaurant'. In an area with limited 'non-franchise' options, Chatterpauls is a beacon!"}
{"text":"Always great food and service! Never had a bad experience and can't go wrong with their steak or seafood!"}
{"text":"Had the lamb shank for lunch, can't say enough.  Recommended by a friend and it's going on our list of favorite spots."}
{"text":"Just  moved to Pickering and googled top Durham restaurants. Chatterpaul's came up and looked like a nice venue. We went yesterday, Jan 20 2018, and were blown away by the hospitality, the food and atmosphere.  The servers were incredibly attentive and extremely nice.  The food was absolutely delicious. It was a wonderful date night!!  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service , highly recommended!! Jerk chicken with curry sauce was unbelievable!!! I had the chef special which was pork tenderloin, tasty !!  Creme brûlée is a most !!!!"}
{"text":"Part of my 'burbs dining experiences that occurs once a month with my high school English teacher, Ms. B.  Yes, I art a Nerd (with a capital N). With 6:30PM reservations in hand, we proceeded to CP.  They call you a day in advance to confirm your reservation so make sure you confirm, or you may be sans table when you arrive.  CP is located in a strip mall on Brock Street in Whitby.  I should've seen this as a prophetic sign as to what to expect.  Most restaurants located in a mall, strip or not, aren't the type that will knock your socks off or float your boat.  Parking was plentiful.   We were greeted by the hostess who proceeded to tell us \"You are aware of the 8:30PM reservation after you right?\"  Um... no.  Nobody bothered to tell us that, not at the time of reservation, nor at the time of confirmation.  Deduct 1 star.  We were promptly seated and our server for the night greeted us.  Ms. B likes her white wines, so we always order a half litre of whatever their house white is.  The house white at CP's is a bit pricier than other places, $23 for a half litre.    Instead of a bread basket, CP offers up an amuse-bouche; it was everything BUT amusing.  It was a sad, braised beef with a square of puff pastry on top.  It looked like something out of a grocery store freezer.  For me, the amuse-bouche is a teaser is a teaser, the chance to showcase creativity and culinary expertise.  But I guess when comparing it to a bread basket, it is mildly more \"amusing.\"  We ended up having a 3-course meal to share, as I try to give full reviews which encompass the entire experience.  To start, we ordered the \"Chattercake\" & Greens which is prepared with lump crab meat & vegetables blended with \"Chatterpaul's Kitchen\" spices accompanied by fennel, pineapple, celeriac & tomato salad w/ pepitas & flax seed, with pineapple, mango chutney.  Our salad didn't have any tomato in it as per the description.  It was a very flavorful salad with many different Indian spices.  Texturally, this was a very interesting salad.  What I first assumed to be pieces of Bibb Lettuce turned out to be fried rice paper (somebody turn up the lights or get me a new presecription?).  It reminded me of really really thin prawn chips that you could get at the Chinese grocery stores.  Instead of flax seed, they used Pumpkin Seeds which gave a nice nuttiness to the salad.  Overall, a great salad.  For our main, we ordered the Chilean Sea Bass served over lobster and beetroot-infused risotto.  We were informed after ordering the dish that the chef now prepares it differently than as stated.  Instead, it would be served in a tomato-cream sauce with mushroom ravioli. I guess the chef is getting lazy and mushroom ravioli is probably less time-consuming to make then \"beetroot-infused risotto.\"  For $35, I felt this dish was overpriced.  The dish, first and foremost, was only slightly warm, and had probably been sitting on a heating plate while we were finishing up our salad.  It came with 3 pieces of mushroom ravioli, and the lobster meat got drowned in the huge sea of tomato-cream sauce.  So we pretty much paid $35 for a generous serving of tomato-cream sauce.  Second star deduction.  They do not have a dessert menu, but your server will recite you the desserts.  We ended up getting the Chocolate Eruption Cake which has a brownie crust, and is a chocolate cheesecake on top served with whipped cream and berries.  I think that the whipped cream came together wonderfully with the cheesecake, and only wished that they were more generous with the serving of whipped cream.  We also ordered a decaf and cappuccino; both of which were not hot enough.  I should also mention the lack of attention to detail, as the foam from my cappuccino had overflowed onto the saucer and was served to me that way.  I guess they thought that I would deem it as some sort of \"artistic\" presentation.... NOT  Our server was pretty attentive throughout the evening.  Our water glasses were topped up, and she was always available when we needed her.  However, she seemed to always have a perplexed/stressed look on her face whenever we flagged her down; the poor girl!    There was one noteworthy occurrence tonight; which would've been that Penny (who appears to be the restaurant manager) came over to our table and greeted us.  She informed me she was the one who took my reservation over the phone and asked how everything was and thanked us for joining them for dinner tonight.  All in all, CP is trying to be the happening and fancy restaurant of Whitby. It is definitely a happening place to go for dinner with a date or friends. But for God's sakes, if you're going to try to be all high class, don't use plastic flowers anywhere!  All their flowers inside and outside the restaurant were plastic.  Just cheapens the place. If you want to pay a premium for ambiance for undersized portions and okay food, by all means, come to Chatterpaul's!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend, his parents & I went here last night to celebrate his dad's birthday. When we got there we were told our table wasn't ready (we had a reservation) but we saw 3 booths had reserved signs on them. There's nowhere to sit or stand, so we awkwardly shuffled over to the bar, which was pretty crowded. We wanted to get a drink but the bartender didn't come over to us. Someone came up to us shortly after and showed us our table. It was one of the 3 tables that were reserved.  Ambiance is nice but loud. I wouldn't go here for an anniversary or romantic night.  One appetizer didn't come out (like other reviews mentioned). The server looked at me and seemed annoyed at me. I said my boyfriend ordered both of our appetizers as we were sharing. The server even said \"those are both good\" when my boyfriend ordered the 2 apps. Everyone got an app in front of them but me. Obviously an appetizer is missing. We had the coco's & crabcake. It was good. I liked the sauce. Boyfriend's mom wanted a salad but server said the salads listed are very large. He suggested just a starter salad so she got that. It was still a good size. Boyfriend's dad got the mussels. They came with roasted almonds. Different.  Our second appetizer came out quickly. \"Here's the meat balls\" the server said as he handed it to me. I thought oh great he messed it up. We ordered the spicy calamari. We were expecting Cajun spices or something on the calamari. It was a tomato meat sauce with tons of slices of jalapeños. Very spicy. We liked it but not sure we'd order it again.  We got the steak & lobster. My lobster tail was cold. Butter wasn't even warm. The steak was a perfect square so I'm not sure what cut that was. Boyfriend's parents had lamb & salmon. The sauce from the crab cake went with the salmon. Pirogies were under the salmon. Different combination.  Presentation of all dishes was nice. Server asked how the food was after two people were already done eating.  Boyfriend's mom ordered a tea after dinner. We got Spanish coffee and B52 for his Dad. His mom asked the server for milk for her tea. He said \"yeah I'll get you milk for your green tea.\" Definite attitude in his tone and he made it clear he didn't think she should be having milk with her tea, but who cares! She's paying for it. She can have sugar in it too if she wants. I didn't appreciate his attitude. For this reason alone, I'd rather go to keg. Staff are more professional & food is hot.  Overall 2.5 stars. Missing an appetizer, drink menu was small, cold entree, attitude from our server & loud atmosphere (one table had a VERY obnoxious woman screaming & cackling from another room).  Pros: free parking, nicely decorated and lovely presentation of food.  The light fixtures were really cool.  Not sure if I'd go back. We don't live in the area so it's nothing we'd go out of our way for."}
{"text":"Food is amazing!  Plating is beautiful.  Brought my mother here at her request, I'd never been there before.  Was pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant itself is very well done, something you would expect to see in Toronto.  Service is excellent.  If you go there on your birthday your lunch is free!  Overall the place has a higher-end feel to it, including a high priced menu.  But the food and atmosphere are worth it."}
{"text":"Went here for my father in laws 60th bday party. Can't say enough about the place.  Service was incredible, they accomodated a 25 seat reservation, had it all ready, baked him a cake, moved tables around, you name it. Just stellar.  The food was top notch across the board. Everyone in the family was blown away, great food with a ton of choices, they accommodated my sister's gluten free needs, my lactose needs, didn't bat an eye.  Wine list was great... Everything was a bit pricey it seemed at first but the final bill was totally reasonable considering what we just had... The cake they made was fantastic and I don't even like cake...  My wife had to wait an extra 5 mins for her duck to be finished so the chef sent out a small plate of pasta for her to enjoy while she waited. And then when the duck showed up, they packed up the rest of the pasta for her to take home. WHAT. And the duck was amaaazzzziiing.  Holy hell.  Oh and to top it off when we left, they gave my father in law and $25 gift certificate for his bday.   Just stunning service.  Don't let the location fool you, it is one of the nicest, classiest places.... I won't even say in Whitby, I will say in all of the GTA, and this is coming from a snobby Toronto foodie.  *slow clap*"}
{"text":"I went here for my brothers birthday in summer 2012, I have the braised beef rib on mashed potatoes with au jus.   The atmosphere and presentation are A+. Intimate lighting, nicely styled, and good colors. The plate presentations on the food from what I saw are pretty good all around.   I found the food portions to be all over the place, with the pasta my father ordered to be quite large compared to my beef rib, vs the fish dish my mother ordered. The food definitely has thought and care put into it. I found it to be a little on the salty side, but I wouldn't necessarily assume this is the same for all the dishes as I only tried the beef rib.   All that being said, If I was going for a date in the area, I would consider Chatterpaul's as one of my options."}
{"text":"I found this place to be pretty dated, and the menu while trying to be \"original\"  is just overly complicated, which is overwhelming.   The spicy calamari appetizer was good, fresh and flavourful, but hardly any calamari compared to the amount of tomato/olive medley it was hiding in.    It seems as though the kitchen, in trying to be fancy,  has added two too many ingredients  to every dish. For example: \"Breast of chicken stuffed with asiago, pepper jack, roasted red peppers, asparagus (alright, sounds good)  perched on top of sundried tomato, garlic smoked chicken (more chicken?) potato cake with Kahlua cream sauce\" (?!?). Good lord.  I also don't like how they pour the sauce all over the food for you at the table. This showmanship is unnecessary, especially when the sauce isn't great. My dining companion ordered the dish mentioned above and (unsurprisingly) was not into the Kahlua cream sauce which her chicken was swimming in. Too sweet.    I ordered the beef ribs (which were good! Very meaty/tender) but was also not crazy about the sauce, which it was drowning in.   The desserts were all great. We had the banana cheesecake and creme brule.   Service was spotty, but well intended.   The music (90's R'n B) and decor could be updated. I found this place very expensive for what we got ($125 for two people).   Needs a makeover/simplified menu before I'd return for that price!"}
{"text":"There are not a lot of foodies out here in Durham (lets be honest), but for those who are looking for an awesome place to enjoy some quality fine dining out here in Whitby area and beyond, THIS IS THE PLACE. Although this is a french restaurant, some of their pasta dishes are good enough that I would consider this a place for some good Italian style food too - of course the ingredients are not as typical of a italian restaurant, but there definitely are elements of that :)  I love this restaurant. I've tried appeitzers, pasta, and desserts. They are ALL GOOD! The prices are pretty reasonable given the quality of food that you are getting.  They first gave us a bit of sausage as a \"pre-appetizer\", then i ordered the shrimp and lobster bisque, crabcake and their dessert, one of my all-time favourite (so much that one time i stopped by just to buy it as takeout for my fiance's mom) - banana cheesecake.  Shrimp and lobster bisque: - definitely super flavourful. Lots of action packed into this little bowl of soup. My only comment was that i felt the bisque was a bit too salty - yes the flavour is rich, but the salt kind of overpowered the soup just a tad bit. But otherwise i love the soup, because it taste like it's actual bisque made from scratch, not sure if people know what lobster broth taste like, but that taste is definitely there when i'm eating the soup.  Crabcake: - super flakey, and the size is HUGE! I wasn't expecting such a large portion, but i'm glad tha'ts all i ordered because it was filling! lots of flavour in the crabcake as well, battered really well, and I love how it's super flaky so it's not very dense in the breading. topped off with their sauce on the side. amazing! my only comment: next time i would like the sauce on the side, because when you put it around the crab cake in the dish, it's too much sauce for my liking - I prefer to dip mine separately. But great appetizer to have!  Banana cheesecake: - how can one go wrong on this. you can actually buy a whole cheesecake for 75 bucks lol. OR buy it by the slice. The first time i went by just to get it I felt kind of embarrassed, but the waiter there was super nice and told me that in fact the cheesecake is so well known that people buy it as take out all the time (which is also the same time i found out you can buy the whole cake lol). Anyway, I don't know about you, but this banana cheesecake is AMAZING! it's soft, moist, full of banana flavour and yet you can still taste the cheesecake!  anyway all in all, definitely a must try. I tried their pasta on other occasions as well - pasta always fresh made, you can definitely taste the difference when the pasta is freshly made. Sauce is great - in general the dish is a bit on the saltier side than I would've liked, but the composition of the pasta dishes is very well made. I've had the buttersquah ravioli and the seafood linguine.  Also - tried the sea bass. AMAZING! it was so well done, soft, moist, flaky and just melted in your mouth! if you love fish, definitely give one of their seasonal/feature fish dishes a try!  These guys also own Tetra restaurant as well in Bowmanville! Foodies out in Bowmanville probably already know about this little gem :)  They currently still have the THURSDAY PASTA NIGHT! until January of this month tho... not sure if they are gonna keep it on afterwards, but it's an amazing deal! pasta, wine and dessert for 30 bucks!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Whitby... Hands down.   Expensive, but well worth the money.  Service is fantastic too.  I've enjoyed a few great meals at Chatterpauls.  I would strongly recommend the Chatterib - which is just sooooo tasty it's unbelievable.  The steaks are great too.  Always a great restaurant for date night with the wife, and I strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"Excellent casual fine dining that's close to home. Typically if I wanted to have some upper scale food I immediately think of downtown Toronto. Well, no more downtown for me.   I had been here 3 times so far, all for celebrations. I do have to say the wait times for the actual food was a tad bit longer than I like but the food and service makes up for it.   The lamb: so melt in your mouth tender and the pairing of the potatoes was devine.  The duck: cooked med-rare, the meat was so rich and yummy. I can only describe as \"drool\"  The Chatter rib: spiced well and quite beefy. The meat is fork tender and falls right off the bone.   The service is amazing. The last time we went we ordered the mussels and requesting to be cooked with the marinara sauce and when the dish came it was sauced in the Thai curry. We brought this up to our server's attention and she immediately put in an order for a new one and had us keep the curry one as well.   Will return here again and again.   Thumbs up all the way!"}
{"text":"I am amazed and a little obsessed with this find. Lovely ambiance and great vibe. Servers and staff are super amazing and friendly. Chef's talents are wondrous. Sensational foods and tasty options in general. I had the mahi mahi on a lobster Potato cake and my hubby had the chatter ribs.  Mouth watering. They also had non alcoholic wine for me and I was thrilled. I returned the next night with 6 friends in tow to celebrate my birthday. Sat at the bar and had amazing apps. The Brie,calamari and bruschetta were to die for. My new favourite place in Whitby!"}
{"text":"Rob Dias is amazing!!!!! The food here was amazing. I feel like we tried half of the menu. The escargot is so delicious. The baked Brie is perfection. The portion sizes are large and great to share. The spicy calamari is unique and a staple at this restaurant. Great to share with a group of people. Nice ambience"}
{"text":"My wife, son and I decided to try this neighbourhood restaurant after having so many recommendations from friends and work acquaintances who live in the Durham region. Boy were we all surprised at how absolutely tasty our meal choices were at this very inconspicuous, quiet but cozy Canadian/Caribbean blended fusion cuisine restaurant situated in a North Whitby plaza at 3500 Brock St.(N).  Definitely a great place to spend with friends and/or family or both while enjoying a great meal."}
{"text":"Went there with my wife for an anniversary.  It was not cheap, but it was truly special.  If you really want to do it right....break out your wallet and enjoy some fantastic food."}
{"text":"ChatterPaul's is an exciting and vibrant Place.  Finally had a chance to try Chatterpaul's which I had heard was excellent and it certainly delivered. (I rated it as french but that isnt quite right)  Service, decor and ambiance is first rate and it is a buzzing vibrant place with full tables involved in conversations and a kitchen that is open to the restaurant which adds excitement and a connection to the food being prepared by Co-owner & Chef James (Chadman) Thomas-Chatterpaul.  The Menu is varied with a variety of fresh seafood and other meats.   After being seated we were served our drinks and offered an Amuse Bouche from the kitchen in the form of  braised beef over cous cous and a spinach leaf which was a tasty surprise and not common in many Durham Region restaurants (wish it was).  We were presented with two menu's - The standard dinner menu and the feature menu. We were also told about a couple of the features of the night as well. One was steak and lobster and the other was Chilean Sea bass which I asked about and was informed it was farm raised, which I hope was the case as our oceans are under incredible pressures and Chilean Seabass is on the edge of extinction, so I applaud their consideration of this issue.  We chose the features:  Grilled Halibut Filet of halibut crusted with tomato courgette mounded over spinach beetroot laced risotto with morels of lobster meat. This was prepared perfectly and the risotto was very creative and delicious and it looked amazing. (I got a slight bite)  My meal was an indulgence of Steak and lobster with a NY strip and a whole cooked lobster served beautifully presented with mascarpone mash potatoes and a brandy beef stock reduction. There was also a delicious cauliflower/rutabaga puree and rapini (aka broccoli rabe ) as well as a large bowl of clarified butter for the lobster.  Final thoughts - We will definitely be going back here when our budget permits as it is a a vibrant and good place to eat. The reason I did not give it 5 stars is that this is not a budget place to eat so it gets a MUCH more critical eye from my side and these include.   Negatives -  My lobster was a bit tough (might have been the lobster..) and the NY strip which cut far too thin especially for a $50 entree and this resulted in a tougher steak even though I did order it medium rare which it was in the very middle, but was a small band through the middle and I would have preferred a thicker cut steak even if smaller.  Finally - I do not like menus without prices and the dessert menu had none on it which is minor issue, but I feel put off if I have to ask. I wondered after if dessert was actually included and perhaps I missed out, but no one told us and I refused to ask. Also there were three of the five desserts had white chocolate in them and they may have been great, but I am not a fan of white chocolate (its not actually chocolate and is not to my taste).  Positives - Atmosphere, diverse menu, fresh ingredients, food quality, service, Gluten free by request.  Overall a very nice restaurant and their website is very good to show you the place, I would recommend it and yes we will be going back for another try."}
{"text":"The apps where delicious, but the mains lack the same jest. I do not recommend the steak, way over cooked and under seasoned."}
{"text":"Our meal would've been better if we didn't witness one of the slightly larger female chefs - brunette with glasses -  sneezing into her hand and continuing to cook, completely unbothered. Love the concept of seeing my food prepared from a distance, but not if its done so without proper hygeine. This occured a few weeks ago, but surely hasn't escaped my memory. 2 stars for the service and food, though."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I chose to go to Chatterpaul's for a romantic Valentines Day dinner (the day after Valentines day though) as he had been there before and I had heard great things. We were able to get a 7PM reservation and when we arrived, we were seated immediately. I will say, this place is popular, there was a crowd waiting at the door when we arrived.  After perusing their specials menu and talking to the waitress, I ended up getting the baked brie to start and the Aged New York steak from the special menu that comes with scallops and shrimp.   We were served a delicious amuse bouche, a mouthful of jerk chicken, which was incredible. Our appetizers arrived not long after. The baked brie is lightly breaded and has a nice coating on the outside and when you break into it, the brie just oozes everywhere. It was served with wonton type chips and while I looooove wonton chips, I really felt they didn't go with the brie very well. I would have preferred to see a crusty bread or something with a different texture.  My boyfriend had commented that he thought our order had come up in the window because he could see the scallops and shrimp on the side of the steak and shortly thereafter our plates arrived at the table. I didn't think to check for it when it arrived but two bites in, I noticed that a) there was no seafood on the plate and b) the steak was rather large (regular steak, 10 oz, steak I ordered, 5oz). When the waitress came by I asked her which steak it was. It looks like she ordered the wrong steak; she asked if she could fix it and get the other one but at this point, we had already started our meal and to get another steak and sides ready would have taken at least 10-15 minutes. I didnt want my boyfriend to sit awkwardly and try to not eat in order to wait for me, so I just went ahead with what I had.   While the steak was good, and the potatoes with it were as well, I didn't realize how much I was looking forward to the other steak and its accouterments. I actually ended up being very disappointed with my dinner. The steak was good and I ate almost the entire thing, but I didn't feel like there was anything special about it. Places like this that offer steak as a part of a wide menu really have to work hard to get me on board with their steak. It needs to be a cut above what I found find anywhere else and this wasn't. It wasn't bad, it just didn't live up to my expectations.  Although I was getting full, when dessert was offered and a white chocolate creme brulee was mentioned, I couldn't say no. They did mentino the carrot cake, which isn't made in house but rather is made by the owner's mother every day, but creme brulee was calling out to me. And rightly so as it was delicious. My boyfriend had never had creme brulee and wasn't interested in dessert at all but I managed to convince him to try it and he ended up eating about half of it!  The service was good and the ambiance was okay. My complaint about ambiance has NOTHING to do with the restaurant but the jackass that was seated at the table next to us who kept dropping fbombs during dinner and was being obnoxious. Moving on...  Overall, this was an okay experience. I think when you've dined in downtown Toronto at some of the best/unique places, its really hard for a suburban \"gem\" to make the cut. A lot of people highly recommend this place and its good for what it is - a sort of upscale restaurant located in the burbs where there isn't much choice to begin with. I'd rather drive the 40 minutes to Queen East and have a memorable meal I'll be talking about for months. I might come back but it's not on my list for anytime soon."}
{"text":"Excellent food , excellent service, with a great atmosphere it's pricey but worth it. If your looking for fine dining in Whitby Chatterpauls will not disappoint. Already planning our next visit."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite place to go for a cute, upscale (by Whitby standards) lunch.   I've never had anything here that I didn't like. I think I've tried almost everything on their lunch and appetizer menus and all of their desserts. If you have a sweet tooth, like me, just go and give them your money.   I could go on for days about all the good things at this place. Service, atmosphere, food, drinks...all A+. Just go."}
{"text":"This is long time due review I wanted to get out there after a recent incident!!!  We visited this restaurant a year ago and we were recommended this place by a very close Friend that makes frequent visits to this place. It was my wife and myself. The food was 45 mins late on a Sunday. It wasn't even busy. After flagging down the server couple of times our food was brought to the table. We had never eaten here before so had no idea what the specs were of our order.  I was about to dig into the food that was put In front of me and the server came by quickly and snatched the food off my table. They had set down a wrong order for me.   He did not say anything prior to grabbing the food and just took off with it.   I was hungry after waiting for 45 mins and was already breathing over the food that was left for the time it was in front of me.   The food was taken and put down in front of another guest which I thought was so unhygienic.  I complained to the manager and he comped our food and asked us to try the place again. He also took the food away from the other guest or that's what I was told.  After a year I wanted to try the place and so called in to make reservations for our anniversary.   The hostess who answered the phone was so distracted over the phone and asked if I could be placed on hold.  She came back after 5 mins and I explained my reservation details. She mentioned that they were booked but had a lounge space that we could have. I wanted to get more details so I could have something organised for my wife as it was a surprise for her, the hostess put me on hold again. This time she returned and I could hear the guests in the background but she wasn't saying anything. I kept trying to get her attention but it was a waste of 15 mins to just book a table.  I am sorry to say the food is good at this place but sometimes the servers and hostess are a bit arrogant."}
{"text":"Chatterpauls ambiance, tight knit space and good lighting makes it a great place to go on a date or a group dinner. The service was great and the servers were very knowledgable on the food and wine. The reason for my 3 stars was that my food tasted good however there was a lack of pasta, two pieces of tortillinis to be exact. I ordered the rainbow trout that was cooked well however could have been more seasoned. I tried my friends dishes and they weren't bad. I was told there are other dishes on the menu that are great. If they are great then I will try to see if I could raise the rating at Chattetpauls with a 4 star."}
