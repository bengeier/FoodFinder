{"text":"Overall this place is the definition of \"Just okay\". The food is actually pretty cheap and on the whole is not that bad, toss in free popcorn and there are worse places to eat when you want bar food. The wings are my favorite thing to get but they are only good (I.e. Not dry and overcooked) about half of the time so it's a toss up whether or not you will enjoy them.

The real draw back is the service. The waitresses are uninterested at best and downright rude at worst. They always seem like it is an inconvenience that you are there. One time a waitress just stared at us with a scowl on her face from the other room because we had sat down at a table with a group of friends on a Saturday night (at like midnight) and so she couldn't leave as long as someone was sitting at a table. We weren't there to eat, the kitchen was closed, and we found out that she didn't have to stay at all after all so she was rude to us for no reason.

The service is bad, the food is okay, avoid if you can,"}
{"text":"Not only is it slow but she never let me finish placing my food order. Horrible service takes a long time."}
{"text":"After you walk through the front doors, the place is split into two separate areas. The bar is to your right, and the dining room is to your left through another door.

Service can be sort of hit or miss here, but the food is good. They offer wraps, wings, burgers, etc. So, it's essentially your typical bar food. I ordered the chicken strips and fries, while my boyfriend ordered the buffalo chicken wrap. Everything was really good for a late night bite to eat.

I'm not entirely sure what weekend nights at the bar are like, but I have been here on a week night after work with a few friends. I don't get the vibe that it gets really busy. So if you want to get away from a crowd, it's perfect for a place to sit and have a drink with a friend."}
{"text":"I had my first experience here recently and had a great time! Ordered wings and then an appetizer sampler to go along with a few brews while waiting. The service was enjoyable and friendly and the atmosphere was welcoming. The only minor criticism would have to be the platter, I expected the batter in which everything was fried to have more flavor but sadly, it was bland. There wasn't much seasoning on any of the platter and the marinara tasted cheap and bland as well. The lack of flavor in the batter made it impossible to enjoy or really eat most of the platter but, I'd try it again in hopes that it will improve. Will definitely return to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"If you go in the day the ladies at the bar will roll their eyes at the thought of pouring you a draft or getting you soup. In the dining room at night they will roll your eyes when you come in. They will tell you how badly they want to go home and how tired they are. They will make you wait 10 minutes for menus and then complain that you're not ordering for cleanup because the kitchen is closing in half an hour. Can you order an appetizer and I'll say the cooks will kill you because they have to cut all that cheese. Other than popping in for a beer when the loan mail bartender is working, I have never had a good experience. This place has average food with bar subpar service. Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"Pretty typical bar food, some days are better than others.

Usually good, had a western burger once that was just awful, like someone dumped a whole bottle of liquid smoke on it. Couldn't eat it.

Other than that, probably been here 10 times and its typical decent bar food."}
{"text":"Completely awful.   Ordered a pizza and it took 1 hour and 15 minutes and the place was only 1/4 busy and they got it wrong TWICE.  We didn't realize the 2nd screw up until we got home.  We assumed after the 1st screw up and apology they'd get it right. The bartenders were dancing like they wanted to have fun but paid zero attention to our order.   WILL NEVER GO BACK."}
{"text":"I am a Blinky's regular. Their food is great, ice cold beer, decent prices,friendly staff, what's not to love?"}
{"text":"Service is REALLY slow, the waitresses are not very friendly and they have no clue what is going on. 

Dont expect to be in and out quick. We have gone for lunch since it is close to our office and you will see retirees sitting at the bar drinking at 11:30 AM, they allow smoking so avoid this place if it bothers you. 
Food is not worth the wait, although it is cheap...which means its not high qaulity."}
{"text":"Wait staff has a sense of urgency.  This is a good thing.  I wish, though, that there were more of a wait staff, because the timeliness was totally lacking.  We went on wing night; wing sauces were good, but the wings were lukewarm and a bit dried out.  For the price, though (dirt cheap!!).  40 cent wings and cheap Yuengling after 8!!"}
{"text":"I've lived 3 blocks from Blinky's for the last five years, and I've only been here about 6 times. So how can I give this place 5 stars when I'm never here? Well I'll tell you: smoke free, great food, CHEAP drinks, and probably my favorite part, absolutely Zero attitude. So why don't I come here more often? That's a question that I ask myself on a regular basis. The only reason that I can come up with, is because I'm 28, and most of my friends want to go to Larryville, downtown, south side, etc. I'd say the average age of the Patrons at Blinky's is probably 50, and 80% of them are men. Which I enjoy in a solid local bar, but it's hard to sell that to my friends. Anyways, if you want a great laid back bar experience, then you can't go wrong with Blinky's. No matter what age you are."}
{"text":"Moved here 3 years ago and finally decided to try out Blinky's with my father. I heard great things about the fish sandwich. Too bad the service was so horrible that after waiting for 45 minutes AFTER our food order was placed we still had no food. After inquiring a few times about our food the young waitress confirmed that our food hadn't even been started!!!  I asked for the check for our beers and I wanted to talk to the manager. Even though the bar wasn't nearly that busy, the manager was too busy to come and talk... My dad wanted the $7.50 for 2 beers comped, but instead we payed and left, NEVER to return. We went down the road to a place I frequent and should have just went there from the start... Thanks for confirming that your service is very lacking Blinky's! I gave you a chance but won't ever try Blinky's again.  Update: the owner contacted me and apologized for the poor service from the new waitress. We went back and had two fish sandwiches on the house. The owner came and personally apologized. They have earned my respect back and I will be a customer again. Kudos for correcting the issue and offering a sincere apology."}
{"text":"Well, the other comments seem to be right on target.  Good food, but service is horrible.  Waited 20 minutes for a waitress.  They even looked right at us a few times then looked away.  When we saw the couple who came in after us get food we got up and chased someone down.  Waitress finally came over and was unapologetic, basically blaming us for no service because we had bought drinks at the bar while waiting for a table.  The food did come pretty quick and was good but they never offered to refill our drinks.  Also, they were out of coleslaw and told us 3 times it would be taken off the bill.  Got home to find they charged us $3+ for coleslaw we never got."}
{"text":"Was in town for a few days and thoughts I'd pop in for a few beers.  Less than 10 people at the bar and you would have thought it was a packed house given the lack of service.  After I waited about 10 minutes the bartender decided she would finally get to me.  Sadly, on delivery she hit me with the amount of the beer instead on trying to set me up with a tab.  Maybe she just hates guys, I don't know, but I won't be back to this joint again.  In the service industry the absence of being friendly is a costly attribute..."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, clean and quick service. Parking is very limited on Wednesday nights because of a neighboring business. Other then that, you should check it out! I will come again."}
{"text":"Great little local bar with awesome and cheap drink specials. The bar splits in to two different sections when you walk in. Booths on the left if you want to grab a bit to eat and sit.  A bunch of tables/space around the bar you'd rather just hang out to the right. We love Blinky's!"}
{"text":"Went there to watch the NFL playoffs. They have an AMEX sticker on their door and when it came time to pay I handed them my AMEX card. They refused to accept it. What? The manager treated me like I was a criminal trying to skip out on a $24 tab when that was the only card I had. Super embarrassing. I was rudely told to check the door for an AMEX sticker next time I go somewhere, and sure enough it was there when I pointed it out. Once again. What? On top of that they turned off the NFL playoffs for a regular season Penguins game without warning. I guess unless you are a regular I would definitely advise you to steer clear of this establishment."}
{"text":"10 outta 10. 2.50 beers plus tax. Ya can't beet dat. You wanna have fun... come here. It's cool."}
