{"text":"Update - returned to the Great Dane in Fitchburg.  Had the Mayan chicken wrap, spinach tortilla wrap with lettuce and grilled chicken and a nice ranch-based dressing.  Asked for chipotle mayo on the side, was not needed.  New chef or just hit them on the right night.  Anyway, far superior to my last visit here.  Very nicely done."}
{"text":"Great beer. Great food. Great service.  The Speedbump IPA was really good.  I like going to places and asking what their favorite dish is. Our bartender suggested the steak salad,  and it was very good. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The Great Dane is a favorite local place for my husband and I. It has okay beers, and they tend to revise favorite dishes like the Inner Warmth Peanut Stew, and...the staff is kind of hit and miss...BUT we've had far more positive experiences than negative here. Their menu offers a lot of different options and most are very good. Their downstairs bar and beer garden are fun, interesting spaces. A familiar, comfortable place to grab some food and play casual pool."}
{"text":"Been to original, Hilldale, Wausau and Fitchburg locations many times.  My wife liking the place says a lot, but many years have passed and they're not so alone as a brew pub.   Overall a can't go too wrong place."}
{"text":"The Great Dane is a Madison standard and I would recommend it to anyone who is visiting Wisconsin. It is a staple micro brewery in a state that is becoming/is the state of micro-breweries. Even if the food is not incredible, there is still a large menu. I've run into some issues with the wait staff in terms of timeliness, but the Great Dane is a good place."}
{"text":"The Great Dane is a staple local brew pub and restaurant.  It's larger than I originally expected so even when they're busy you're usually able to get a spot quickly.  As expected for a brewery, they have a nice beer selection.  More surprisingly, the food selection is pretty good.  They do an above average job with standard bar food (burgers, sandwiches, cheese curds, etc), but also have some more up-scale items.  I've had their burgers as well as the portobello sandwich and both were very good.  On my most recent visit I got a little more adventurous with the peanut stew (a hearty vege stew in a peanut sauce) and it was excellent.  I may have to start moving beyond the standard bar food."}
{"text":"Awesome Devil's Lake Red Lager and Wings. Can't wait for the the Great Dane's Brat and Bacon Pretzel Burger. Rollin' Wisconsin-style."}
{"text":"A good place to hang out, drink, and eat. The crowd was a little older than my friend and me, but nothing wrong with it. They have a great coffee flavored beer which I recommend trying!  A bratwurst patty, a beef patty, cheddar, caramelized onions, smoked bacon, Pilsner mustard, all served on a salty pretzel bun. This thing is not a light meal, especially sided with mashed potatoes like I had. But it's delicious. The brat patty lends an unexpected flavor to the burger, and the bacon is thick cut. The mashed potatoes are actually really good, but the fried plantains are also a good side."}
{"text":"It's well enough. Smells of spilt beer but without the sticky floors. Being from out of town I didn't realize there were 5 or 6 locations. If you're from Ann Arbor, this place is basically Grizzly Peak Brewing. Everything was unexceptional but not bad. In a town with so many good options, pass it up. Dance club music in such a casual atmosphere was a bold choice."}
{"text":"Great beer, but the chefs have got to learn that medium rare is red and warm! Have been here 15-20 times, and they can't  seem to get it right. Tonight, burgers and prime rib ordered medium rare were almost well done. And that is a consistent problem here."}
{"text":"Yummy pub-style food. Beer flights so that you can sample their many wares. The place is enormous. It would be a little hard to hear if you're trying to have a serious conversation, but otherwise, it's a crowd-pleaser."}
{"text":"Delightful pub right near the Capitol. Came here when I visited Madison last weekend after a friend recommended it as a Madison must visit. Their menu was waaaaay bigger than I'd expect and had a good selection of vegetarian options as well as the usual staples. We started off with their beer bread, served with honey butter. It was good and so filling, I hardly had room for my actual dinner. Make sure to save room for the homemade sodas! I tried the root beer and the cream soda and they were both amazing.   All in all, a great place!"}
{"text":"oh great dane, how do i love thee, let me count the ways... 1. crop circle wheat...a truly delicious light beer, even better with a lemon squeezed in 2. artichoke dip in a bread bowl...need i say more 3. a burger with artichoke dip on top of it...i can die a happy girl 4. southwest tortellini...a delicious pasta dish that's large enough to enjoy some the next day 5. tomato soup...so warm and toasty...love it with 1/2 a sandwich 6. the beer garden...does summer in madison get any better? 7. somewhere to always bring my parents when i came to visit...and they actually liked the food!    highly highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The crop cirle wheat and the Noctoberfest are OK.  Most of the special beers are nothing special.  I just wish they would make a bit more effort with their beers.  Food is good and reasonably prices"}
{"text":"Average bar food at an average bar. The beer is fine. The food is fine. The wait is forever and I don't get it."}
{"text":"West African Chicken Peanut Stew... YUM!  Went with gf and family here while in Madison to attend a graduation and this is where we went the first night.  I know i've been here before, but didn't remember much. The burgers gf and I had were really good. Loved my black and tan while gf had the sustainaburger. As mentioned before, loved the chicken peanut stew... Very good. Beer bread with honey butter was also really good, but I don't think worth the price.  Gf's brother seemed to like the beers as before we left Madison he bought two growlers of beer. Good stuff here."}
{"text":"Three things I love about the Great Dane (near the square).  Pool tables: I could shoot pool for hours-I love the setup and old time feel of the pool hall area. The natural wood, classic style tables, and social feel all make it a great place to chill with some drinks and sink some pool balls.   Root beer: probably my favorite drink, and theirs is awesome. Try it. Multiple times.  Outdoor seating: in the summer, it's a great little hideaway that stays cool in the shade.   I usually just go here for a couple drinks, an app, and pool. The food is good-nothing out of the ordinary-but the setting allows it to be a good place to return to.   One critique would be that the pool tables are badly in need of re-felting. They're beginning to really show their wear, stains, and are past faded."}
{"text":"Delicious, especially the Webster Street Chicken salad (although a few times the kitchen staff has been oddly stingy with one ingredient, like the walnuts or the bleu cheese.)  Can be ber-crowded on weekends, in which case a wait of fifteen minutes for a table is not uncommon."}
{"text":"Good beer.  Good food.  Great place to take a group of people or pickier eaters as the menu has a little bit of everything.  The typical pub food is really top-notch and there is a lot of variety on the menu.  I've had all kinds of dishes here and never been disappointed.   (except when they took my favorite cajun-style haddock sandwich off the menu)"}
{"text":"For years, The Great Dane has been a place I've taken my family to or eaten at with friends.  I've never been a fan of their beer but the food used to be really good.  I ate there a month ago and was extremely disappointed.  The atmosphere is still very good, very fun and enjoyable.    The food was awful.  It was so mediocre.  I ordered a veggie burger like I have many times before but the whole burger was flavorless and the fries, which I normally love, were not at all good.  Three of us had poor meals, only one of us enjoyed her meal (some kind of spicy burger).  The past couple of times weren't so good food-wise, and this sealed the deal: Great Dane, you are no more to me!  It's really unfortunate because the back patio is one Madison's best, and this is such a homey place and great for families, right downtown.  I just expected more from the food. :("}
{"text":"The previous reviewer was right. Their Thai chicken salad is EXCELLENT. The dressing on the salad is to die for. I have been trying to come up with my own  at home but no suck luck yet. I love the huge slice of beer bread with a butter.  I always order the salad when I go. But mind you, they don't always have the salad available. Apparently, they change their menu often. The last a couple times have been great disappointment because the menu that has the salad was not out.  I don't drink so I can comment on their beer or any other food. If you like salad with a twist, try the thai salad. I love love , love it."}
{"text":"Food is pretty fucking good.  They do a decent burger, and the nachos are great.  Enough for two - easily.  Forgetting the beer part of the menu, this place is like TGI Friday's but with class, not packed with families, but with yuppies (or whatever passes for a yuppy in Madison).    Beer is pretty fucking good two.  It's a brew pub, so there are a bajillion different kinds on tap.  They've even got traditional cask ale, which is just like normal beer but served warm and flat.  Just like they did it back in the day.  You know, before fucking electricity was invented and everyone died from lame ass diseases.  The prices are not pretty fucking good.  It's $4.50 a pint.  That sucks.  And they don't have cheap ass beers on tap, so if you're a broke as student and want to mix it up a bit to save a few bucks, well - you're fucked.    Also, for that pretty fucking good burger, prepare to pay like 10 bucks."}
{"text":"The reviews clearly reflect times patrons came to the bar/restaurant when it's not busy. It took well over an hour to get our food and our waitress was rude and unapologetic while we waited. Food was average. Beer was average. Service was well below average. The grits were solid slop. If you are from the south DO NOT get grits here. I cannot emphasize how horrible the service was. Waitress was absolutely awful."}
{"text":"Great beer...  But I will not return.  They filter their juke box music too disallow any country genre..  Wow"}
{"text":"I always get the fish tacos with sweet potato fries. Best in town. I really haven't had better fish tacos anywhere else despite my many failed attempts. They have a decent brunch buffet but you literally won't be able to eat for 3 days, it is an insane amount of food and you get full just looking at it all!"}
{"text":"Had a great time.  It was a perfect summer night for beer. We ate on the patio - warm without bugs. Also a man spinning some tunes.   From Ohio and wanted to try Wisconsin beers.  The sampler was the way to go especially with cheese curds and beer bread.   My husband had the sausage plate - being German he never can resist - he like the favors.  I had the chicken pot pie - a little too thick but filling.  I think the prices were reasonable    We walked around the downtown for an enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"The Dane Burger consists of one-third pound of choice beef broiled to perfection, and then topped with lettuce, tomato, pickles, Bermuda onions and artichoke dip. The fact that this is a messy burger does not take too much thought. The Dane Burger does a good job of combining flavors with the standout topping being the artichoke dip. I found that the lettuce, tomato, and onion dressed the burger's appearance up, but did not do much for flavor or texture. Upon removing them the burger seemed more focused on the combination of the dip, beef, and bun. The beef could have been a little juicier, and I can't help but think what a really unique and tender bun that pairs perfectly with the artichoke dip could have done to make this burger a dream.   Despite my thoughts on what this burger could have been, it is still a great burger and made me rethink the typical hamburger. For taking a risk and delivering, the Dane Burger is worth a try. Add-in the Great Dane's excellent beer, fun atmosphere, and tasty sides/snack and you have the makings of one the best bars in Madison."}
{"text":"You know something is wrong when the celery sticks and ranch dip are the best part of the meal. Plus, we waited an hour for the food to arrive so we were hungry enough for anything to taste amazing. But the burger was dry and the eggs Benedict had the most tasteless hollandaise sauce I've ever experienced. The cheese curds were soggy and swimming in oil.  Beer was good but each one literally took 15 minutes to make it to our table after ordering. With all the amazing food in Madison I am sad to have wasted a meal here."}
{"text":"Wir hatten die 24-er Chicken Wings Platte und sie war absolut genial! Allerdings muss man sagen, dass die extra scharfen wirklich zu ihrem Namen stehen - nichts für schwache Gemüter."}
{"text":"I tried not to love the Dane. Really, I did.   When you say you're moving to Madison, everyone immediately gushes that you have to go to the Great Dane. So of course, we went. I sat down, immediately sure that I was going to be disappointed in the bar food. Surely, the beer will be sub-par as well.  Foiled again, as Dastardly would say. The craft beer, brewed by the Dane herself, is fantastic. The German Pilsner in particular is one of the best I've ever had. I could drink a gallon of it on a hot day. The food, much of it classic Midwest comfort food, hits the spot and leaves you wanting more.   When we don't feel like going downtown, we hit up the Fitchburg location, which is equally fantastic. If you're just visiting, make it a priority to stop here. If you're a local, you're either already a fan or a dirty, dirty liar."}
{"text":"A brew pub with a \"master brewer\" in residence. Seasonals are worth a try.  I ate my average burger at lunch while the brewer walked his latest creation around to the staff. As a brewer myself, I was 'green with envy' as every new batch is like a new baby, and the first tasting has the magic of holding that newborn baby in your arms.  The blond dining waitress was a sweet girl next door stunner and the bartender was a regular joe. My kinda pub.  Tons of unoccupied regulation pool tables (properly swept) and where else can you get a \"Wanna bone\" T-shirt and play it off as a 'big dog' innuendo.  Next time I come back I'll get a 'to-go' container and test the TSA on their 3oz policy."}
{"text":"up a hill, down a hill, up a hill, down a hill, along a lake, along another lake, up the capitol stairs, down the capitol stairs, through the arboretum (drive, trails, and all) I need a beer and some cheese curds pronto!!! Maybe this review is slightly affected by the fact that we were both starving and had been talking about all the beer we were looking forward to trying...but the cheese curds, the portabella sandwich, the sausage platter (i hear) and the four beers we tried were all phenomenal."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Craft beer was good. Did not take discover card, just an fyi. Over all good experience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Decent microbrew pub.  Beer outweighs the food, but the nachos platter is a great starter.  Hourly pool and some big screens make it a nice place to chill while you watch a game."}
{"text":"The numerous times I've been to the Great Dane have been fantastic! Their micro-brewed beers are excellent, with a range from deep dark stouts, porters, and deliciously boozy Scotch ales,  to hoppy, citrusy IPA's and lighter yet equally great pilsners and lagers. You truly can taste the care and craft in their brews! I also appreciate that though they have several locations, each one is unique unto itself, and not carbon-copies of each other. The food is also delicious, offering both tasty pub fare as well as more ethnicly styled dishes. I would recommend the fish tacos, and anything German-inspired they have to offer! The atmosphere is comfortable classic pub, without being a college bar or too stuffy. Great for fun dates, great food, and excellent beers!"}
{"text":"Came to this place on a Thursday night with a few people. I was in town, from California, visiting for a few days and had heard a lot of good things about the Great Dane. To start things off, I had the Crop Circle Wheat beer, which was pretty darn good. We also ordered some cheese curds, which were pretty amazing. For my entree, I had the Mad City meatloaf. It was probably one of the better meatloaves I've had in a long, long time. It was seasoned very well and the fried onions and peppers on top were a nice combination of flavor. Crop Circle Wheat + Mad City meatloaf + cheese curds = a full tummy. Definitely a place to check out if you're visiting. Next time I'm in town, I'm gonna have to try a few more of their brews."}
{"text":"Interesting food here! And it's across the street from the Wyndham Garden hotel, which sits on the Capital City bike trail. I was here two nights in a row. The German plate was good, but the Tandoori chicken dish was excellent. It's not like you get it at an Indian restaurant. It was Tandoori spice meets Mediterranean goodness. Didn't try the beer this trip; next time!"}
{"text":"I cannot review the food, as we simply came for pre-dinner beers. We were in town from Chicago, and this place had a great selection. Everything our table tried was excellent. Our server knew nothing about beer, but luckily my husband and uncle are brewers and could navigate our group in the right direction. They also will serve their craft beer in pitchers - god bless college students!"}
{"text":"Went to the one in Fitchburg on Sunday and - sigh - it was super crowded and the hostess was downright bitchy. They have a brunch and a limited menu (it's the late night menu) until about 2;30. Brunch is $17.....very rich food for the most part. Eggs, desserts, donuts, soup & salad, small peel & eat shrimp, chef carved meat, biscuits & gravy, hush puppies, waffles, bacon, and more. Most of the food by noon was a little past its prime but the servers and staff were definitely hustling. Save yourself attitude and make a reservation if you go on a sunday. Otherwise, the beer if solid. PS it's also a noisy place inside, my 70-year-old dad couldn't hear me above the din."}
{"text":"ALL THE GREAT DANES ARE GARBAGE...ive been to all of them and the food was absolutely horrible and mixed drinks taste like puke. They always manage to have the worst customer service and always overcook/undercook my food.....junk junk junk"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Good healthy portions and the price was just right.   However, nothing compares to their home brewed beer on tap. Not sure what beer to get, ask the staff. It almost as though they encourage the staff to drink every night to have that intimate knowledge of their  cervezas."}
{"text":"I love a good micro brew so going here was a no brainer.  Since we wanted to eat and it being a Friday night, the wait for a table was long.  It didn't help that we had to change our request from two people , then five and finally seven!  Not the restaurants fault, but it took about 90 minutes to get seated.  While we waited we were able to get drinks at the bar pretty quickly.  I stuck with the light Lager and the red Lager.  Both were very fresh and tasty to a beer snob like me. Once we got seated I was introduced to fried cheese curds (kurds?) that are standard issue in these parts.  Wow, how have I never had these before!  I don't know what if any cheese is in these things but they are delicious.  They taste very much like fried mozzarella cheese. We started with two orders for the table then quickly doubled it.   For my meal I tried the buffalo chicken fingers with asian sauce and a side of chips.  They were both great and after all the curds, filled me up.  Most of the other people got various fish, but I didn't pay much attention to anything not deep fried. This place was very busy on a Friday night but I didn't feel packed in.  I will absolutely go back to Great Dane if I ever find myself in Madison again."}
{"text":"The food (and beer!) is consistently delicious at The Great Dane. I'm always amazed at how big and diverse the menu is here... I'd say that this would be a very good destination for groups with a variety of palates.   There's a number of Great Dane locations in and around Madison, but the environment here is the best of them all. Interesting, historic building with a really rich and comfortable interior - the basement has a gorgeous fireplace and field stone hearth that makes the space really cozy in the winter."}
{"text":"The place is broken up into different and unique eating areas. So everytime you go you can have a different experience.   I enjoy going with both family and friends. The food is great and the drinks are flowing."}
{"text":"During the summer, I go to the Dane twice a week or more.  This has more to do with them being a sponsor of MUFA (Madison Ultimate Frisbee Association) leagues than anything, but off season, I go nearly once a month.  The food is great, the service usually stellar, and the beer is the best in Madison.  Try Potters Run and Texas Speedbump for pale ale's , the Stone of Scone scotch ale is spectacular, and if you like wheat beer, the Crop Circle must be okay, since even I will drink it.  Summertime will give a selection of fruit beers, which I don't consider beer, but if you dig that sort of thing you'll be good to go!  Overall, it's a great place to be, and I definitely recommend the garden during late spring, early summer unless it rained in the last 24 hours, as the garbage from the restaurant next door can get a bit rank.  If you want to eat right away, avoid Fridays and Saturdays after 7:00, you won't get a table until around 8:00."}
{"text":"This had to be the worst experience with trying to dine out of my life.  Our party of 7 was originally told that there would be a 45 minute wait.  At the 50 minute mark, we noticed a table for 8 that was being cleared and assumed it was for us.  When we inquired as to where our name was on the list, we were told that it would still be a short wait.  They then seated three people at the large table.  After waiting over an hour, we again inquired as to where we were on the list and were told they were trying to find us a table.  When we pointed out that the large table had been used for only three people, we were told that they could \"squeeze us into\" a booth.  (Why they didn't seat the three people at a booth is beyond me.)  After 90 minutes, we were told that a large table had opened up downstairs and they were clearing it for us and it would be about 5 minutes.  Ten minutes later, the manager informed us that one of the owners had just come in with a large party and was given the table we were promised.  After waiting for almost two hours, we finally just left. During every encounter we had with the hostess staff and the manager, they were rude and condescending.  The customer service was so horribly bad as to not even be believeable.  Someone suggested we write a letter to the owners, but apparently the owners are part of the problem since they were the ones who came in with a large party and just took an empty table regardless of who might be on the list waiting for it.  Even if the food were top-notch (which we wouldn't know since we never got that far), the lack of respect for customers and the horrible way we were treated wouldn't make even the best food worth it."}
{"text":"The vibe at Great Dane is really laid back and fun. The shuffleboard on the second floor, the lighting, and the taps at some tables all make this feel like a classic Madison brewpub. The drinks were pretty good, solid selection.   Food was better than expected. We stopped in mainly thinking it would be a solid pub with overpriced and bland food but the selections were very diverse, the prices reasonable, and the service fast.   The meatloaf was great, as was the Great Dane Burger and Pork buns. I'd avoid the cheese curds, despite their being an area staple. Great Dane's are not nearly as good as, say, the old fashioned. Almost look like they came from a bag. The pretzel bread; however, is excellent. It's almost a mix between a cake-bread dessert and a salty pretzel. Served with delicious honey butter!"}
{"text":"I have visited Great Dane many times and every time I leave, I am satisfied, happy with the selection and quality.   To start, they brew their own beer right on site at most if not all their locations and you can take growlers out with you before 9pm for home enjoyment of some great unique brews, many of which are exclusive to Great Dane.  Next is the menu, it always is able to hit the spot no matter your appetite for the day. The menu ranges from great starters that are veggie to fatty and delicious to the many sandwiches and entrees, all of which are to make you full, happy and satisfied. My favorite burger is the Brat and Bacon Pretzel Burger, even if it is an elbow dripper, it is worth it.   Lastly, the atmosphere... not only do you walk in to the smell of yeast and malt (indicative of a real brew pub) but you also walk into an active, happy place where you can find your space and enjoy with family and friends. Whether you are looking to just sit down at the bar, play some pool or shuffleboard, or just grab a table and be served with a smile; Great Dane is the place with many options and welcomes everyone into their \"home\" for great fun, food and drinks.  Overall, a great Madison staple and would be sorely missed by all who love a brew pub that knows what they are doing. I definitely suggest a pop on by next time you are in town. :-)"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service, thanks Zoe. Beer is awesome."}
{"text":"This is a fine brew pub. I wouldn't really actively seek it out for its food or beer but I think both are decent. If you play ultimate frisbee in Madison you find yourself in these establishments a bit too often."}
{"text":"a Madison staple! Everyone always asks \"have you gone to the Great Dane?\" Good beer - great food - impeccable service! Lots of space, beer garden, fun atmosphere, great downtown location!"}
{"text":"Nice cozy pub.  Awesome atmosphere. Everyone is extremely friendly.  Beer brewed here. First one is nice.  \"Kolsch\".  Gonna try a few.  4 pool tables to play. Very cool!"}
{"text":"The problem with the Great Dane Brewery lies in its sampler.  If you're drinking only one brew at a time, you're not likely to notice this fault.  I arrived excited by all the options so decided to try 8 samples of GD Beer.  Each beer tasted watered now and strongly sour.  This was very disappointing.  A brewery should put its efforts into brewing quality beer, Great Dane does not."}
{"text":"Great Dane (downtown) has always been a regular stop for me. Service is always great and personable. Beer is good, but I feel as if the standards have gone down a bit since I've started. Maybe just a bad batch, but it will definitely not stop me from stopping by and shoot some pool or darts. I haven't played around with much food here, but from what I've had, brunch was excellent, while I feel some of the dinner food was overpriced for the quality.  RATINGS (A+  --  F) Service: A- Food: (Brunch: B+) (Dinner: C) Drinks: B+ Price Point: B Atmosphere: B+ Overall Experience: B"}
{"text":"Was in Madison on business on a Tuesday night and stumbled upon this place. Definitely recommend it. The menu was in an adorable newspaper format. Great cheese curds (which I was told I had to try while in WI) and an interesting twist on mac 'n' cheese. The cream soda was to die for!!"}
{"text":"I have more conflicted thoughts on the Dane, than Norman Bates does on a good day.    Point: -Dane sponsors a lot of leagues/clubs around town offering free pitchers and discounts. -Always has a very sizable selection of beers with reasonable tags. -Very uniquely Madison and dares to be different. -Large space that on most weekdays can accommodate larger groups. -Garden downstairs remained a secret from me for years, but it rocks. -Nice downtown location...(*personality changing* though by Madison standards, difficult parking)  Counterpoint: -Has a lot of down nights, with annoying frat tossers and overcrowding. -The food is better than regular bar food but I wouldn't come here specifically to eat (as many unwisely do) -The beers overall tend to be more on the hoppy side (may or may not be your deal) I like hops but have never once remarked 'I love that beer!' -Busier hours, spottier bar service especially upstairs.   It's worth an occasional visit but it's not the go-to destination like the Terrace or even a more local/casual bar.  Like a famous club the original Dane is sorta played out to residents.  If you can handle the drive and less idyllic surroundings, I prefer the Ale Asylum for beer and comfort."}
{"text":"For a long time we kept going back because of that beautiful outdoor garden/patio. BUT, the food is just consistently very mediocre. Disappointing. Weird to me that it's such a madison staple. Go to the Old Fashioned instead...much better food, more fun (no garden though)."}
{"text":"The Great Dane was a place I could count on to enjoy spending time with friends. Last night they had a DJ who played house music, yet, there is no dance floor. The music was so loud we couldn't have a conversation. It appeared to be an issue for other patrons as two-thirds of the population left by 11:00 pm. We soon took our business to another \"ale house\" where we could spend time together, creating laughs and memories instead of shouting at each other while our eardrums suffered damage from the volume of the music.  That said, the servers and bartenders were very nice and quite attentive and the food was pretty good.  If we wanted to go \"clubbing\" we would have chosen to go to a club, with a dance floor. I recommend that this facility figure out its brand, atmosphere, and the clientele they serve and what will continue to draw that crowd. Last night wasn't it."}
{"text":"Meh. This pretty much sums it up. Their beers are kinda meh, the food is definitely meh, atmosphere, service, decor - meh, meh, meh."}
{"text":"Don't miss out on the beer bread and honey butter. Great variety on the menu. I could  have easily gone overboard. Shared a Margarita Pizza - the crust wasn't my favorite, kind of thick, a little doughy  -- so the pizza didn't rock my world, but there are other great entrees on the menu that I'm dying to go back and try."}
{"text":"Great service, good beer (pale ale, out of ipa), good food.   The TVs though are too high to comfortably watch a game.   They should be lowered about a foot.   Pool tables are in good condition.   Good value."}
{"text":"Good fish and chips and kids menu.  Great choice of beers,  I would have liked to try the beer garden but there was a long wait for outside so we took a booth which was a little noisey but okay.  My daughter had the Mac and cheese which was really tasty."}
{"text":"THE CHEESE CURDS. Do it. Seriously. Beer battered and awesome.  Just had to say that. But any who, a great pub it was full and there was a wait, but my sister and I didn't feel like waiting and decided just to head to the bar and order our food there. Awesome beers and I love the decorative dog heads on the tap and the variety of beers, and the dark wood. Really gives it that pub feel. I ordered a Peck's Pils which was great and wings were good too.  When I get a chance to come back to Wisconsin I am definitely coming back here! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Why? Why have you never in however many years of really good business fixed that nasty basement women's bathroom? Every toilet's stained and nicked and falling over. The doors don't lock. The stalls have all kinds of unidentifiable hardened goo. The place has been painted 13 times, like a bad omen to permanent uncleanliness.  What's so frustrating about their bathroom is that their food's actually good. But, their crappy bathrooms have kept me from going there many a time.  Why You Should Be Embarrassed to Own this Place: Business sense includes recognizing the need to maintain the upkeep of your establishment. If you can't buy new toilets and get some new stalls for the ladies, then you're a dumba-- and don't deserve my business."}
{"text":"The perfect menu and beer. This place has it all, from American to some Latin options such as enchiladas and jerk pork tacos. The chicken pot pie is delicious! Everything here is! The beer variety is great. The staff is super friendly and the food always comes out fast. I've never gotten something I didn't like. Best place in Madison for delicious food in a relaxed environment."}
{"text":"I was in the Madison area recently and in need of some good craft beer - so based off some suggestions, we decided to check out The Great Dane.  We showed up on a Saturday around lunchtime and the restaurant was about half-full.  I contemplated a few different menu options (there are many), but finally settled on the buffalo chicken mac and cheese.  Positives: -They brew their own beer!  I was only able to try the Crop Circle Wheat, but wished I had time to try them all. -Awesome menu with a wide selection and some regional items.  I passed on the brats and mash, but will have to get them next time.  Negatives: -Parking was slim in the back of the restaurant, we ended up parking on the street next to a nearby apartment building.  I guess there was parking in the front as well, but I didn't see how much room was available. -Prices are a tad high for food, but their craft beer prices are great.  A fun local place to grab some food and brews in Madison - I certainly wouldn't mind stopping again to try some more of their beer."}
{"text":"Great food and a menu that should satisfy a picky eater. With a wide range of choices I've tried everything on their menu! Everything tastes fresh and worth every dollar. The west African chicken peanut stew is amazing! Also I recommend their Reuben sandwich. OMG. Anything I've ordered has exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"I was in Madison for a 2-day business trip and decided to come here for dinner. It was the best meatloaf I've ever eaten. In fact, I liked it so much that I ate here again the next day before going off to catch my plane."}
{"text":"Best patio in town, best beer brewed in Madison (better than Capital anyway), attractive and well informed staff, hearty bar-food that's more eclectic than you're usual neighborhood bar, and a variety of atmospheres ranging from a sports bar to a pool hall to a German rathskeller (with good music on the juke to boot) to bar & grill, what's not to love about the Great Dane?  Probably the weekend night crowd, full of suburbanites and frat boys jostling you about.  Basically the typical State Street Brats crowd but give them 5 years, 25 lbs, and a job in Verona.  I love this place any other time than 10 PM or later Thursday through Sunday.  So the point is, this place is set up to be awesome and has a spot for everyone, but it's not always full of cool people.  Go for the beer, the food, the patio, the pool, etc.  But just don't go when it's full of rude ex-frat boys, alright \"brah.\""}
{"text":"Another one of Madison's staple institutions, the Great Dane is a perfect place to bring a larger group of people since they have such ample seating. Its a noisy place so be prepared to speak quite loudly to one another.   Great selection of Wisconsin beers on tap, and a variety they brew themselves. The food is very good, though nothing that will really shock you. They use fresh ingredients and will never disappoint. Large portions also guarantee you won't go home hungry!  My favorite aspect of the Great Dane is the pay by the hour pool. They have great pool tables and a selection of sticks which are suitable even for very good players. If you are looking for some of the better pool players in Madison the Great Dane is where they will be."}
{"text":"We went here because they have a gluten-free menu.  While the menu is gluten-free, it's not particularly healthy and is full of dairy and fried foods.  There were a few healthier options and I picked the salmon. It was alright. My biggest complaint is that the salad that comes with the entree came covered in croutons.  The waiter knew I ordered from the gluten-free menu but wasn't paying much attention to the details.  Oh well.  I didn't drink the beer but my friend that did said it was good."}
{"text":"The food was average... But that seems to be the MO for Madison restaurants. Everyone thought the Fish Fry, Cheese Curds, and Fish Tacos were ok, but nothing to write home about. Maybe we should have tried the burgers?  The fried plaintains were an awesome side or subtitution to fries.   Beers were ok too. The Isle Stout was very similar to Guiness, maybe a little bit more flavorful.   The highlight of the meal was the outdoor back patio/garden. It's completely secluded and beautiful. Definitely sit out there if the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Had dinner at the bar and the two bartenders had great personalities and were very attentive even while being very busy.  The beer is excellent as was the fish and chips.  Going back tonight to try the burger which looked freakin awesome! Update- Went back and had the Texarkana Burger and it was as good as it looked!"}
{"text":"Yes, their food and beer are both very yummy. I ate here with friends earlier and it was good (cheese curds as an appetizer). They also do growler fills so recently I took home a growler full of their pilsner. I sampled the wheat beer and it was also good. I am looking forward to trying more of their beers!"}
{"text":"This place by far is one of my favorite brew pubs. Leave it to Wisconsin to put beer in their Mac and Cheese. I usually get a burger here, because they are tasty, but I can't think of anything I had here that was really nasty. They have this one West African Chicken Peanut Stew or something that is really tasty, and I recommend their hot pretzels and beer bread with honey butter for an appetizer. The cheese curds were pretty yummy too, but cheese curds are cheese curds, but the mustards they give you with the pretzels is fantastic! I can't comment on their beer that they brew on site, but my parents don't complain when they drink it. I know there's a lot of places to eat in Madison, but me and my family always go out of our way to eat here at least once, if not twice when we are in town."}
{"text":"Veggie burrito is awesome and HUGE.  Kid's menu was good/kid friendly options on regular menu.  The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because the dining room lacks atmosphere.  It's very plain/generic.  The bar has much more character.  But with kids - the dining room is a much more appropriate place to eat."}
{"text":"There's so many things to love about all the Great Danes. The size, style, beers and menus. I want to make this place work, want to love the food and service I keep giving another chance but now I'm done. All my general comments refer to visits at the Cottage Grove location on Jupiter as well as this one in Fitchburg.  First of all, clean the bathrooms. I don't want to feel like I'm at a campground latrine. I've gone when it's not busy and watched the hostess, bartenders, servers and managers having a bit of downtime, and yet the bathrooms aren't touched for hours at a time. Once at the Cottage Grove location I pointed this out to the bartender, that it's dead and workers aren't busy and the bathroom has been dirty for hours. His response, \"There's an outside service we hire to clean up every night after close.... It's not as if this is like any fast food restaurant that has a schedule for checking the bathrooms periodically throughout the night.\" He said this with a straight face, with no awareness that he was actually making a case that Taco Bell has higher standards. Anyways I've never seen a clean bathroom. What other hygiene shortcuts are being taken where the customers can't see them?  Service at the bar. Once my beer seemed flatter and a bit cloudier than I wanted. Maybe my expectations were wrong for that beer? I asked the bartender. He agreed that the lager I was drinking should be more fizzy and clear, and explained that if it's from the end of an old barrel, the last pull could come out like that. I told him I ordered that style because I wanted a beer that was light, clear and crisp. He nodded in agreement, then left me hanging. Basically, letting me know, \"sorry the beer we served you was old, stale and flat. Too bad so sad. Ciao.\" Great job!  I've always found the server staff to be excellent. Not always perfect. At my last visit in Fburg my server had that annoying habit of squatting down to get at eye level with us. Would you like to slide into our booth and spoon a bit, too? Sorry, we ain't cool like that. Stand up and do your JOB.  The menu looks amazing but he food rarely lives up. A few positive points first. The pilsner cheddar sauce on the Black and Tan burger is representative of what this place is all about: upgraded pub food with their unique twist. Bratwurst is good. When hot the pub fries are very simple but excellent. The produce for their salads is really fresh, and the recipes for their salads have well balanced flavors and are surprisingly satisfying.  One of my favorite things about their menu is that you can order smaller bargain plates if the usual dinner is just too big. It's called the Pub Picnic section and you can get half of any sandwich with a couple small sides for $10 or less, for example, and other nicely sized listings.  Now the bad...  RED ALERT: AVOID THE SHREDDED PORK AT ALL COSTS. This is not the tender, juicy, flavorful carnitas you're hoping for. I have no reason to doubt that it is derived from some sort of swine species. All the fat, flavor, juice and anything 'pork' about it is processed and cooked out of it, leaving tough dry, fibrous, meat-like threads soaked with water and then whatever mediocre bbq sauce.  I asked for my burger to be medium rare it came out blood raw. For the rest of the day I couldn't shake the memory of that mushy, raw meat mouth feel. The fries on that plate were cold. The restaurant was dead at that time and every time the kitchen door swung open there appeared to be no shortage of kitchen staff.  The ahi is grocery-store-sushi grade fish, bland and limp, with an overly thick and powerful crust and a sear that goes way too deep.   One of the big problems I've consistently have no matter when I visit either location is getting all the food out in an orderly fashion, all ingredients fresh and hot. For example, it could take a long time to get an appetizer and then moments later out comes the entrees. Or the entrees don't come out all together. Or one food item will have signs that it was prepared long ago (burnt, cold, microwaved, etc) while another item on the same plate will be too hot to eat.  I always enter optimistic and hopeful. I'm not overly picky or looking for a fight. I just want a clean environment, good service and good food. Again, servers: great job; bartenders hit or miss; managers alternate between running around putting out fires or standing around looking lost. The kitchen is a disaster.  One final good note: management is always very responsive and willing to own the issues and make an offer to satisfy disappointed customers. I don't want to get comped items or coupons for a next visit, I just want things to go right. Any establishment can have a bad day and one of my pet peeves is encountering service staff or managers that are more concerned about going into cya mode or blaming others. In this respect they do a great job.  But in the end it's just empty potential"}
{"text":"Went for the Friday fish fry and opted to sit outside which was nice.  Three of us drinks which came lightning fast, then ordered fish and waited and waited and waited.  We also noticed most of the other tables had people looking like they too were wondering where the heck there dinner was.  When our dinners did come out, they were brought by servers, not our waitress.  The food wasn't warm, it was cool.  Fish should be piping hot and it was apparent this had been sitting for a long time to get this cool.  In defense of our waitress, she was working really a lot of tables and I'm not sure if it was her job to deliver the food.   When she asked how our dinner was and we told her it was cold (duh) she asked what she could do.  Well really, what could she do since we sure weren't going to wait another 40 min. for another meal.  She did take off our drinks - two root beers and a beer and while that was appreciated, it didn't make up for the lateness and cold presentation of our food.  There are so many great places to get a hot, tasty Friday fish that I would avoid the Dane.  By the way, the 2 eating next to us said their soup was also cold which they sent back and had to wait 10 min to get it returned to their table hot.  We used to come here frequently and had noticed a decline in the food and service but this time they blew it and I doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"The best use I can think of for the former Fess Hotel in Madison.  Boisterous, full of brews and good pub food, the Great Dane is a great place to fill up, either liquid or not."}
{"text":"The best service staff I have had in a long time. Overheard unhappy customers at the next table and they handled it like champs. Food was great and beer selection rocked."}
{"text":"We were seated immediately on a relatively busy afternoon.  Our food came quickly and the main reason I have for writing this review is to say how incredibly pleased I was with the smoked beef brisket guajillo.    I was expecting it to be good, but I wasn't expecting it to be so incredibly delicious.  The beef was braised to perfection and was smothered in a savory adobo-like sauce.  Rounding out the plate was a nice side of sweet potato tots that were also awesome, and 2 johnny cakes stuffed with sharp cheddar and covered with a roasted corn salsa.  Finally, you get a generous side of Great Dane's Wisconsin mac and cheese.  I recommend taking some of the sauce over the beef and mixing it in with the mac.    This, my friends, was an incredible meal.  The best I've had in recent memory and given how unique, inventive, and flavorful this dish is, it was a bargain at $14.  Bravo, Great Dane!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has 4 stars. The beer and pretzels were delicious. The fish fry was over cooked and blah. My salad was wilted. It's easy to find good beer. I can live without the pretzels. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The burger is OK. Some beers are better than others. Really more like 3.5 stars. Could be 4 stars with some improvements to the menu."}
{"text":"What makes this place great is that everything the have is good or very good. When we decide to go out to eat the default is generally the Great Dane because they have such a wide variety of food and do a good job at each dish that it doesn't matter what we are in the mood for. They also have pretty good beer. A good combo I like to get is the Oatmeal Stout and the Pot Pie they go well together especially in the wintertime. Another combo is the Crop Circle Wheat with the Fish Tacos.   Two things I would rate exceptional: The Nakoma Nachos (served all night), and the clam chowder (Fridays only).   When it is busy or a long wait just sit at the bar, there is usually available space. In conclusion: it be a mighty fine Pub."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town. Sent our son back the hotel to feed the dog. Couldn't put our name in for a table til he got there so waited an hour for a table. Margaritas suck."}
{"text":"French onion soup was really good, I also had a half turkey sandwich.  Sanchwich was ok nothing to brag about.  Also had poutine for the first time as an appetizer and it was decent, probably wouldn't get it again."}
{"text":"I have visited the Great Dane twice while in Madison on business.  I did not eat on my most recent trip, but that's OK.  I go there for the beer--and it's pretty good stuff!  I am especially a fan of their Porters.  Black Earth Porter is named well, as its taste does have an earthy quality and wonderful mouthfeel.  I know there are pool tables and food at the place, but it all seems superfluous when the beer is this solid!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice, both times accompanied by my children.  While they made sure to set us away from the younger crowd, they didn't shove us next to the kitchen or in an unheated section (which has been an issues at other restaurants).  The food was very good and the service prompt.  The menu is varied and isn't the same stuff, different bend you find in many places.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"Maybe the people who give this place a positive review are experiencing it through beer goggles? As a non-beer drinker, I am not impressed. There are plenty of better places to spend your money."}
{"text":"Had I written this review a couple of years ago, I would've given the place 5 stars, but it seems that recently the Great Dane has gone straight downhill.   This used to be my go-to place to take friends or relatives when they came to visit from out of town--the food and bar menus had varied selections that could basically please anyone, the prices were fair, the atmosphere was (and still is) great, and the service was (and still is) usually good. I've always loved that there are basically two restaurants in one here: a pool hall and lounge on one side, a sit-down restaurant on the other.  However, despite all of these positive qualities, I can't get over how much some of the stuff has changed.  The portions seem to have gotten smaller (which is fine), but the prices have not reflected this changel. Before, we were shocked at how much food we got for our money, but now, I don't feel like I'm getting the same bang for my buck.   They used to nail everything that came out of their kitchen--from classic bar foods to innovative entrees--but recently, everything that I've tasted has just been average if not worse. There are about 5 different menus, depending on what time and what day you come in, and I'm pretty sure they've changed up a lot of their selection.  On our most recent visit, I ordered the vegetable sandwich. I think it may be a new menu item, and it did NOT work for me at all. The flavors were confusing (broccolini, red peppers, mushroom puree, and microgreens???), the sandwich was poorly constructed (I ended up eating the fillings with a fork and knife because they refused to stay between the bread), and while it came out warm, the fries accompanying it were ice cold. Ditto on the fries served with my husband's burger, which was both flavorless and overcooked. Of the MANY times we've come here over the years, we have never had bad service until this visit. Our server was chatting with coworkers while we sat at our table in need of condiments, silverware, and drink refills. We also sat and waited for boxes while she checked her phone by the drink station, but at least we were entertained by the pool game going on nearby.   This place just isn't impressive anymore. It's sad to say goodbye to an old favorite, but I highly doubt we will return."}
{"text":"Good food, good beer, and good atmosphere.  What else do you need?  The basement is a cool place to hang out to have some drinks; it is kind of like being in a cellar and I mean that in a good way.  Just don't try to order a Miller Lite or something like that because all they serve is what they brew."}
{"text":"A consistent crowd-pleaser every time we go to the Great Dane, no matter the location or the occasion! Our first meal in Madison last winter, the place we take our respective parents and relatives when they visit Madison, and the place we bring picky (and non-picky, for that matter) out-of-town friends and visitors. Standard American fare made interesting and a great pub-like atmosphere. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"We went here twice during our trip to Madison, which shows you how great it was!  We started with the cheese curds. They were actually our least favorite out of the many we tried but we ate them at almost every bar so the competition was stiff. I think the cheese wasn't oozy enough. However, that did make the next restaurant's taste extra amazing! So, well done guys!  The first time there, I got the African peanut stew (I'm pretty sure peanut butter is an ingredient) which was unique and flavorful! I also tried the mac and it held up to my high mac standards nicely.   The best thing I had was at brunch on our last day! The brisket pretzel bun breakfast sandwich! I miss it, just thinking about it. To top it off, I stole a couple tastes of a vanilla bean beer stout float! Amazing.    The beer is pretty good considering they brew all their own and they are more of a restaurant. They had a great scotch ale called Scone of Stone and double wit, that were pretty tasty.   Oh wait, we actually went back again at the airport! Until next time, Great Dane!"}
{"text":"Cheese curds for appetizer were great.  I had the bratwurst and bacon burger which was unique,  tasty,  and delicious. I got the french onion soup as a side and it was great surprise as it was the best part of the meal.  It was even much better than the french onion soup that I had at the tornado room last night, which apparently was supposed to be some of the best in madison. Our server Morgan was nice and very helpful as well in helping us navigate our way around the big menu.  5 out of 5 as far as gastropubs go!"}
{"text":"Great Dane is a staple in Madison. The food is solid, and you always know what to expect."}
{"text":"Good food and drinks.  Great place to watch a game and shoot some pool.  Friendly folks."}
{"text":"This place was good.  It is the typical \"nice restraunt & brewery.\"   Similar to that of Rock Bottom for you Chicagoans or Big River for you Nashvillians.  Seeing as this is a college town, your waiting staff will most likely be an attendee of the school or one who has failed out and decided to live the rest of their life on a college campus refusung to give up the lifestyle.  Nice staff, Smiling faces.  Came in just in time to grab a beer before happy hour ended.  Got the red ale.  Very tasty,  Seeing as how this brought me out of happy hour specials, I decided to get the 10 beer flight since I am not from the area and didn't have time to dilly daly.  I strongly suggest getting flights when you are trying new beers.  It usually ends up being a deal and you can decide on a nesting beer.  Got the meatloaf for dinner.  It was awesome.  If you ever want to judge a kitchen, go for the meatloaf.  Delicious greenbeans that were steamed and mashed potatoes.  Completed me.  After this meal I pretty much instantly went to sleep.  It seemed they have an outdoor beer garden as well, Bam!  If I come back to Madison, I will probably stop in."}
{"text":"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.  The Good Very nice \"hidden\" beer garden. Well shaded for those that don't enjoy the blistering sun (like me). Chicken salad croissant and \"kohl\" slaw were very tasty! Service was very good.   The Bad Nothing!  The Ugly Nothing!"}
{"text":"Based on other reviews, it must have just been a bad day when I visited. We sat at the bar and each ordered a beer. It was a college football Saturday, but the game on the tv was a really bad one. I only assume it had stayed on that channel from the previous game. Since we were the only ones watching that particular tv, I asked the bartender if he could change the channel to the only top-25 match-up that was going on. His response was that he would if he got a minute. It didn't seem that busy and it shouldn't take that long to hit a couple buttons. I'm not a picky person, so I assumed he was busier than he looked and was ok waiting. But a half hour later, he never came back. Small thing, but we definitely left after that one drink.   So yeah, this sounds picky I know, but we were served and then mostly forgotten for the rest of the visit. Maybe they were focusing on the large groups with food. Just my experience of one visit."}
{"text":"This was an excellent \"first time to Madison\" find!  Stayed at Hilton, walked two blocks...great beers on tap. Shrimp and grits a fantastic meal for sharing. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Terrible service...even overheard our server talking shit about us to the bartender....awesome! I don't believe in being mean to servers so even when we had drinks spilled on us and wrong orders delivered, both with no apology, we still said please and thank you. Luckily, we dodged being punched in the teeth (part of the overheard conversation) because we wanted our drinks within 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I really like this location for the great dane.   Went here for my 21st birthday a couple years ago, and since then, it has been a go to place for me.  I have always had friendly interactions with the staff, and the drinks are good. I recommend  the oatmeal stout!  Beer on tap usually costs about 4 or 5 dollars.  They have indoor and outdoor seating, and 3 different bar areas. If your looking for a nice bar without all of the college party kids, the Cahill location is the place to go.  They also have great food. Price point is a bit high, but you get service with a smile and a great atmosphere to go with it.  This is a place I could take family or friends."}
{"text":"Great Madison standard. They know how to treat their regulars well and most of the bartenders are top notch, even on the busy weekend nights. Good diverse crowd on the weekends, pleasantly void of too young college kids. Very good food, with plenty of options. I'm not much of a beer drinker, but they make a great stout in house or have a few Scotch Ales if you want to stumble outta there. A Madtown favorite."}
{"text":"This is a lifetime review, having visited the Dane many times over the last twenty years, otherwise would be 3 stars.  I have enjoyed the Dane's food, beer and atmosphere for years, and this is the first time I thought, it is time to try somewhere new.  The food was sub-par.  We split several apps wings, fish tacos and cheese artichoke dip.  The wings seemed to be breaded and flavorless, and the dip/breadbowl were bad.  The fish tacos were good, but not nearly as good as the last visit when they featured a flavorful slaw.    On the other hand, this was the best beer I have ever had at GD.  The seasonals were well-above average, and Bier de Gard and Zenn Pilsner were top notch, among the best brews I've had in WI - flavorful, interesting well-balanced.    The service was awesome, as always."}
{"text":"Great food and even better beer ordered the Mango Mahi Mahi delicious will be back for more"}
{"text":"Food and beer is over priced.   Service was the worst I have had in a long time.  My wife's food was very cold and they were not happy that we sent it back."}
{"text":"Nice casual place for a good beer and average pub food."}
{"text":"Tried a flight of their draft beers (they brew their own).  I really enjoy good beers. On average their beers were just okay.  Their wheat beer was good not great. Also tried their poutine. Fries were very good but dish was light on cheese curds and heavy on gravy.   Would not get again here.  This can be a great dish if made correctly."}
{"text":"I try to go here ANY TIME I want wings.  They have the BEST wings in Madison by far.  Their wings are meaty and they come with a garganzola sauce that is out of this world.  They also have beer that is fantastic with a great amount of choices.  They also have a Ruben sandwich that is absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  Great place if you want great food and a great atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"Solid choice for lunch or dinner, great beers, their food is quite good, some of the best pub food I've had."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever seen!! Came to eat before packer game. One waitress handfull of customers and didn't get service for over 10 min plus no menu. #dontgohere!!"}
{"text":"Just don't eat at the one in the airport. Cold food."}
{"text":"Not surprisingly the beer was awesome! The service was meh...our waitress could have been a bit more cheery or even interactive. The food was okay, I did expect a bit better but I guess if the focus is on the beer, I can have a less than expected food experience. Overall I'd go again to get a better judge of the experience."}
{"text":"I came here with a girlfriend after work to chill and unwind with a good meal and a nice brew.  The atmosphere was classic brew-pub with simple wooden embelished booths, tables and bar on the inside, and a nice patio on the outside.  Great selection of seasonal drafts as well as their year round wheats and ales.  I tried the Crop Circle Wheat and a seasonal Cream Ale they had, and I must say, that wheat was on point.  I'm not a beer expert by any stretch of the imagination, but I have my tastes, and I definitely enjoyed this one.    When I go to a pub, I'm a sucker for the fish and chips every time.  It came with a choice of 2 or 3 filets with a handsome portion of seasoned fries, cole slaw and a homemade tartar and vinegar on the side.  Very nice flavor on the crip of the fish, but just a touch too breaded for me. Points for crispness and flakiness of the fish, though. Very well done. Fries and tartar were good as well; very hot and fresh, respectively.  My friend ordered a chicken salad, and we had the hummus plate for an app. Yes, hummus.  This place has a pretty varied menu, which always gives me pause. From Margarita pizzas to Tandoori Chicken to Enchiladas, it's all over the map.   Our server, Chad, was great and attentive.  Much of the wait and hostessing staff did seem pretty frazzled and curt. Perhaps they were short of folks that night.  I suppose I'll have to go back for two reasons: trying more food, and ordering the beer flights."}
{"text":"I had the day off, it was 11a.m. so I went and picked this boy (whom I occasionally make out with on a regular basis) and we randomly drove from Chicago to Madison.  We arrived in Madison and went to the Great Dane and ordered every beer they had available, cheese curds, and the mac and cheese. - They were all awesome.  People were cool, bar was fun, it was also 2pm on a Monday so it was cool and quiet.  Get the mac and cheese - its made with otter creek cheddar - enough said - oh and there is the pretzel roll that comes on the side, but that is secondary to the cheesy goodness.  Cheese and beer - way better combo than peas and carrots if you ask me."}
{"text":"Really 3.5 stars...   Beer: It varied from OK to decent. I had the Pale Ale (just OK), Pilsner (decent) and Scottish Ale (good). I like hoppy beers and they really don't offer much on that end.   Food: Large menu with options. I had decent BBQ veggie burger with Kohl slaw. Side salad was large and tasty. Kitchen seemed to have it's act together.   Overall, solid offering although it's not something I would seek out if it weren't convenient."}
{"text":"Good beer. Very good beer. If you've never been to the Great Dane, try the sampler. I like the Crop Circle Wheat or the Scotch Ale, but I've never had a bad Great Dane beer. They have three locations throughout Madison and a mini pub at the airport. All follow the upscale English pub model, and all feature their own brands of beer. I think the first location off the Square is the best. Yes, it's popular amongst students and professionals alike; so avoid it like the plague on Friday or Saturday nights."}
{"text":"I've been to the Great Dane about ten times over the last couple of years. It's been for a variety of work lunches, friends' birthday dinners, and Saturday afternoon pool.  I'm not a fan of the food -- I find it generally pretty bland, and I've never gotten the same thing twice. The burgers are okay, some of the salads are pretty good (the caprese is probably my favorite item on the menu), and I did enjoy the chicken peanut stew, if it did require a bit of hot sauce.   I've tried at least half the beers (as pints) and don't really feel the need to have any more. There aren't any that I've had that I prefer to other similar styles of Wisconsin or even Madison-area beers.  The service has varied, but is usually friendly. I think generally they try to set a relaxed pace and are knowledgeable about the menu (not easy -- it's huge!).   The best thing there is the Saturday pool specials -- $4/hr is a fantastic deal and the tables are in good shape."}
{"text":"The Great Dane Brat and Bacon pretzel burger could stun a water buffalo!  Damn, that is a lot of meat for a tofu eating Pacific Northwesterner.  Still managed to wedge in the deep fried Snicker sundae, which was a bit rich in combination with the burger.  Good, diverse menu.  Draft craft root beer was very good."}
{"text":"ok beer   food was so so.  serve left a lot to be desired.   There are a lot of great places to go in Madison.  Do your self a favor and put this low on the list."}
{"text":"I've never tried their food, I'll admit it.   I was just so psyched about the beer, and I kept trying glass after glass looking for a beer that would make me say \"wow this is great!\"  It never happened. Nothing registered as more than a \"Meh\" the whole night."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where these pictures r from. That being said, went to Mad Town for Easter weekend 'cause the kids r all home with mommy & daddy, so mainly just those of us that actually love spring on the isthmus r still chillin.  I used to love going to this place, so i went back.  Nice move on my part. I stayed on the adult side since little man is with grandparents ;-)  To much fun, no more yankkie my.... wait. Food, pool tables, bars, TVs, floor, bathrooms, bartenders all updated.  Went back for Easter brunch, lunch? not sure what time i made it back to see if I had dreamed it all.  Did I mention the bartenders?  Cypress Hill on Juke, hits from the ..... wait. I love to eat things that once moved, went for veggie selection per super loverly bartenders suggestion.  Did I mention the Bartenders? They rivaled any Downtown supper hottie, with no attitude.  I totally over tipped them all, even the dude was cool"}
{"text":"During a business trip to Madison, this place was recommended by the hotel concierge so, I came here for dinner.  Next time, I'll do my own research for places to eat rather than completely trust the concierge.  I was disappointed with this place.  It's basically a huge, spacious, and loud bar, a good thing if that's what you're looking for, but the qualify of food was the not so good thing.  I had their braised beef.  It was smothered with some overwhelming salty/sweet kind of a barbecue sauce with a side of tater tots looking things and a side of mac and cheese.  Luckily, the beer I ordered was very good enough to wash down what little of the dish I ate.  The apple crisp dish I had for dessert was also underwhelming, the apple pieces were kinda tough and chewy.  The service, however, was the saving grace.  The waitstaff and bartender were friendly and prompt.  Not a place I'd recommend, there's a lot of other good places around the neighborhood where this restaurant is."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends. Their brunch is great and food too! All locations are very nice."}
{"text":"Great local place to enjoy unique bar food and a freshly brewed ale.  I tried the Wisconsin Mac and Cheese and the Chickpea Falafle.  The mac and cheese was creamy and delicious.  The falafle was okay; I ordered it with a side of Cous Cous.  The cous cous was very good.  One side of the building is the bar/eatery; the other is a bar with some dancing.  It's in a great location, right by the Capitol.    If you only had one day in Madison, I would come here for lunch.  It's a very local eatery and worth seeing."}
{"text":"One of my favorite brew pubs in the country! The Great Dane never ceases to amaze: serving up delicious 'Sconnie style food and masterfully crafted beer in a warm, inviting atmosphere that just begs to be on your list of favorites!  I've been a few times now and never had less than extraordinary. Their burgers are awesome, with LOTS of variety in everything from the meat (choose turkey or Buffalo if you want...there's even a burger with a brat), the bun (I usually go with the pretzel), lots of toppings (try some fried onions), and of course, CHEEEESE (well duh, it's Wisconsin).  Oh, also, their fried cheese curds were among the best in Madison.  The beer. It doesn't get better than the beer. They have lots of great seasonals. This last round I indulged in a few pints of the Oktoberfest. But, I've also enjoyed many an amber, lager, pale, and porter (their porter is pretty good).  Their atmosphere is pretty cool too. In addition to their rich, wood tone dining room is also a cozy bar, a cool dark beer \"dungeon\", and a really cool outdoor biergarten.  I would give this place as many stars as Yelp allows, and will be back time after time."}
{"text":"Not crazy about their beer, so I usually get other drinks here. Food is generally ok, lots of choices so it is good for a group and/or kids."}
{"text":"Before leaving Madison for the long drive back to Minneapolis, my wife and I had lunch at the Great Dane. Truth is, we planned our weekend so that it's the last thing we'd do before leaving Mad City.   Part of our enthusiasm for this restaurant is the patio dining. So we were counting on nice weather. The weather cooperated, and we had a nice, comfortable table in the cool, shady patio. The ambiance is so pleasant that we just couldn't identify a Minneapolis restaurant that even compares. The closest would be Black Forest on Nicollet. But we don't like the food as well.   This is a brew pub. So we both ordered a midday tap. She had a Scotch ale. I had a Pilsner. Great brews! You also can get four sampler glasses for $6. Nice way to try several of their specialties.   For lunch, she had a burger and loved it. I couldn't resist the fish and chips. They were delicious. The menu is very extensive and creative. Lots of traditional pub items, plus a great selection of other specialty items.   Some reviewers have complained that the place gets over-crowded. A co-worker and her husband were in Madison the same time as my wife and me. They went for a late dinner after arriving in town on Thursday. It was crowded. But for her, the energy and ambiance was appealing. So to each his own, I guess.  The trouble with a place like this is, we can't imagine a trip to Madison without a visit to Great Dane."}
{"text":"I had babyback + coleslaw + fries. It was more than enough, I opted to finish the tasty coleslaw and wasted the fries. Tried my friend's meatloaf and was tasty too-"}
{"text":"I have visited several of the Great Danes around  Madison. The menu is very big, but I don't find anything on it to be amazing. Yes, they brew there own beer, but there is no shortage of that in Madison. If you're looking for a large selection of food (opposed to getting a great meal), a fun bar atmosphere, and good local beer selection, go here. Other alternatives would be; Sprechers, Old Chicago, or vintage."}
{"text":"What to say?   I have been to the Great Dane possibly a hundred times in the nearly 10 years that I've lived in Madison, so I feel like I should review it.   Sidenote: I played Ulitmate Frisbee with MUFA for several summers, and we went there after our twice-weekly games for beer and dinner because they are the primary sponsor.    I've been to every location in Madison, except the one in the Dane County Airport, and I even visited the Great Dane in Wausau after a funeral. No matter the location, The Great Dane has always been a solid three start experience for me. It's not knock-your-socks-off amazing, but certainly not bad, and the food is pretty consistent. In fact, my biggest gripe with the Great Dane has more to do with their customer service and some of their policies than the food or beer itself.   First of all, their reservation policy sucks. They won't accept reservations unless you have a group of 8 people or more. Then, they won't seat you unless your entire group is present. They also don't make dining with a large group easy, as my next story will illustrate:  One time, my coworkers threw an informal going-away party for me at the Hilldale Great Dane. About 15 people from work showed up, and we all ordered food and drinks. It was a weeknight, and the restaurant was not excessively busy.  At the end of the night, we had racked up quite a bill. The waitress  refused to split our check for us. We only asked for it to be split 6 ways (by couple/family), so we weren't being unreasonable in our request. She refused.  Well, not surprisingly,  none of us working stiffs was willing to pick up the entire $300+  tab for the group, so instead, we had to fumble around with the receipt and try to mark our names next to each item so it could be charged to the appropriate card. Some people, who only had cash, had to awkwardly ask for change. It was a huge hassle. I think she wouldn't split the bill so she could charge automatic gratuity...however, we would have actually tipped more than 18% had she been a good sport about it.  Because of this incident, I have never gone back to the Great Dane with a large group. I would not recommend the Great Dane for any large group events, despite the fact that they have a lot of space.   However, if you're just looking for a nice family meal, then the Great Dane is probably a good bet. Almost all of the menu items are tasty, but I especially like their chicken wings appetizer (in Habanero Hellfire) and their New Mexican nachos. Their burgers leave a little to be desired compared to other places in Madison, but the fries are delicious, when they are served hot. Their beer is not great, but it's not terrible either. I don't have children, but the restaurants seem kid and family friendly (with the exception, perhaps, of their downtown locale).  The Great Dane's recent expansions throughout the region have left it feeling a little bit \"Chotchski-esque\" in my opinion, but it's still probably better than hitting up Applebees.  In general, I  would recommend that the Great Dane become a bit more accommodating of its guests, and treat people as if they value their patronage, instead of acting like they resent having customers. I doubt the popularity of the Great Dane will last forever, and a restaurant can only get by on overpriced (albeit, still tasty) mediocre food and beer for so long..."}
{"text":"Fun place to hang out with friends for some beer. Also, must have the cheese curds."}
{"text":"I'm not particularly keen on their beer, but then again, I've not drank there in a while. However, this place serves some pretty damn tasty food and I have to say that they have the best damn Reuben sandwich I've had in Madison. Friends of mine have recommended the steak and they make them fairly decent if I remember right. Their burgers and nachos seem pretty popular around, but I've not had a chance to try them out fully yet.  The atmosphere is nice for a bar, not ridiculously noisy or trashy, yet pretty fun to be around.  Will need to go there more often before I can give a full review."}
{"text":"I love the Dane for the ambience and the beer. The food is generally decent, but nothing too exciting. There's lots of options, including lots of veggie items, but just decent bar type food. The beer is quite good, with many different kinds from light to dark."}
{"text":"I love this place! I just wish there was a Great Dane here in San Francisco.   I make it a point to eat here when I visit family & friends in Madison. The beer is incredible and so is their food. On my last trip to Madison, I was lucky to catch a Wisconsin style Friday fish-fry.  Beer battered fish with fries and a few other goodies. I drank their porter and their stout.  On another occasion I had their bratwurst with sauerkraut and some other sides that escapes me right now. I just remember the beer! :)  I look forward to revisiting Madison and eating here at the Great Dane."}
{"text":"There are a lot of things to like about the Great Dane in Fitchburg- like other GDs, the menu is varied and you can find some gems there. At the Fitchburg location, if you are seated upstairs during a slow time, it can feel a bit like outer Siberia, but when it's busy, it's not a bad place to sit. There is a regulation size shuffleboard table and a couple of billiards tables as well, and while I've not been there late in the evening, I could imagine easily spending some time hanging out with friends here. hmm..."}
{"text":"Blech.  The menu is expansive, but many of the items are simply not very good.  It's clear that some changes have been made to accomodate the drinking crowd, which is fine, but a recent visit there is most likely our last.  The beer remains the attraction, but it's not a strong enough pull, I'm afraid."}
{"text":"Great, unique burgers. Very busy - great atmosphere.   They have a good list of beers to try, although no individual descriptions. The fried plantains were very good.  Great service!  A must-stop when in Madison"}
{"text":"YUM, YUM, YUMMY! I can get whatever I want at this local bistro bub.  It's a great place to bring the kiddos, and to have a pub burger.  Beer is good too!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great atmosphere! Forgot to get an itemized receipt for work, emailed them and had it in 10 minutes. Excellent service and brew pub!"}
{"text":"Good place, staff, and food!  Don't come very often as I believe it's a little pricey. But the beer selection is amazing."}
{"text":"We celebrated New Year at the Great Dane Brew Pub. It was a wonderful experience. The food is very good. The people out there are quite friendly and the service was great. It can get crowded sometimes and tables might not always be available. Parking is not a problem. There is an adjoining parking structure with ample spots. The special New Year event was pretty good. Will always go back to the Great Dane Brew Pub."}
{"text":"We ate in the basement, and would strongly encourage others to do so.  Great food.  My husband had mac and cheese and loved it.  I had a very nice southwest salad.  Staff was efficient, but not what I would call friendly.  Would go back again.  Husband LOVED the ales on tap."}
{"text":"A big menu and most of the food is pretty solid. They brew their own beer on site, and my favorites are the Stone of Scone Scotch Ale and Crop Circle Wheat. This is a good place to take a big group of people and is in a cool historic building. I highly recommend eating on the patio, it's really nice."}
{"text":"Love this place! Traveling through, lovely beers & very tasty nachos! Thank you!  An old hotel w a lot of space."}
{"text":"We took our kids (5 and 8) here for dinner and sat in the courtyard. Awesome food. Even the \"kid food\" is good. Most places put some fries out of a bag and a microwaved burger in front of your kids. Ours had the Mac and Cheese (I tried some....wonderful!) and a brat. I love their wings, and the service was perfect. It's a great place to visit, and when we are in Madison, we always make a trip to the Dane. If you stay at the Hilton near State Street, it's a two block walk."}
{"text":"Yum! Had the buffalo burger with sweet potato fries.  I went back again the next day and had buffalo chicken with 3 alarm sauce.  Both were excellent.  The Devil's Lake Red beer is great."}
{"text":"I've been to The Great Dane dozens of times over the years  It's my number one standby every time I'm in Madison. Every menu item that I've tried from apps, soups, main courses and desserts has been consistently delicious. Ironically, the first few times I just came for the beer, which is the real draw. The food is just gravy on top - so to speak. I especially love when they have a cask conditioned draft."}
{"text":"I really like the Dane for their delicious late night menu and having a wide variety of items to choose from. However, in recent experiences, it's just hard to be excited to eat at the Great Dane anymore.  I say that with a heavy heart as the bartenders are always so friendly, we always get the 8 sampler flights when we go, which offers decently filled variety of their brews.  We sampled the New London Bridge Fish Fry, Mama's BBQ Meatloaf, Chicken Pot Pie, Carolina BBQ Pork, and Falafel.  Their sides are vast, ranging from your standard pub fries and kettle chips, to the more exotic, cous cous and sweet fried plantains. The portions for the plantains were generous, 6 chunks of brown sugar covered and slightly fried, created a nice sweet counterpart to the Pulled Pork. The cous cous was a refreshing side, albeit a rather bland one. The fries are rather passable, thick cut, but mushy in the middle, completely unremarkable.  Fond memories of the fish fry quickly dispersed, the fish was greasy, the batter coating easily sliding off to the touch of a fork. The Falafel was dry, and any hint of Mediterranean flavor were not apparent. The Meatloaf was a nice size, not as heavy as you'd think for a lunch option, an excellent deal of $12.75, served with mashed potatoes, and steamed veggies. The Chicken Pot Pie was a bit of a let down, our companion received a 4 x 4 sliver of the pot pie and found only a handful pieces of chicken in the entire meal. She managed to fill up on the large heaping of pastry crust and accompanied pretzel roll."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Fresh food, good prices.  Great Beer.  They also have a Sunday Brunch Buffet at a couple locations that is top notch!  Try this place- you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been back twice now, including another location south of downtown.  Dinner was excellent, prices are very reasonable and service was good whether there was a big crowd or not.  The only disappointing thing about this place is they haven't opened a location in my hometown, St. Louis."}
{"text":"Me:  What is the most popular dish on the menu? Waitress:  I don't know, I don't eat meat. Me:  I try NOT to eat meat also. Waitress:  I really don't eat here. Me: Ok, I'll have the poutine.  Ok, she was a bigger girl (for a vegan)  and she wasn't much help.  So, my party had the burgers...they weren't impressed.  Odd, my poutine was the star of the show and it was a $7 appetizer.  I win!  Service:  I picked off the inept waitress and blindly gave her my credit card and snaked the tab from my friends.  Only 15 minutes later, she returned to ask \"is this separate or all together?\"   Dammit!   Awkward moment insues.  Why did I tip you?  Ok, take away a star for mediocre burgers, one star for service....but damn...cool place!"}
{"text":"Ended up getting the Emerald Isle stout with the pork jerk  tacos. Both were excellent and made even better by the attentive and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I gatta say the Ruben here is really good! Stacked and piled high with shaved corned beef, on a bed of sauerkraut, lightly dressed in Thousands Island, all sandwiched between two slices of grilled, fragrant, and flavorful marble rye bread. Slices of swiss cheese were melted on both side of the bread, a plus!   It comes with a side, feeling a little heavy,  I opted with the side salad resulting in an additional $2.75.  The Ruben was $10.25, so $13 for lunch before tip may seem a bit much. However, if you get a regular side is a worthwhile lunch."}
{"text":"Yeah, that's right. The Dane only gets 3 stars. Some people swear by this place, but to me, \"not bad\" sums it up pretty well. The food is decent to good overall. The cheese curds are only okay (the curds at the Old Fashioned and Capital Tap Haus are MUCH better). The tastiest item on the menu is the smothered and covered fried chicken, which is a delightfully artery-clogging boneless fried chicken breast covered in a spicy gravy with shrimp and andouille sausage. I would also recommend the buffalo wings, those are pretty good too.   However, the beer is not good. With the exception of their porter, most are utterly flavorless. The scotch ale is nothing like I was expecting. And I actually think I like Bud Light better than their \"Landmark Light\" lager.  I will say this, though, I love the fact that they have bar shuffleboard at the Dane downtown. Such a fun game, and not something you see every day."}
{"text":"Super generic food that tastes \"meh\". Decor is \"meh.\" Nothing special in terms of cocktails or wine. Make their own beer but they aren't exceptional.  Has nice outdoor patio enclave in the summer but it doesn't add enough to make me want to come here."}
{"text":"Love the Great Dane. I've been living out of state for the past nine years and when we were looking for a place for dinner and I suggested the Dane, my husband answered with an excited, \"yes!\" I had the Daneburger, which has artichoke dip on it. Yumm-o. Though our waiter seemed vehemently bored. Yes, that's a thing, because it's the best word to qualify the level of boredom he was at. And it was a little weird that they seated us way downstairs in the bar area when 1) we had a kid and 2) the upstairs had plenty of seating. Oh well."}
{"text":"Peanut soup that everyone likes is not that great and I am a fan of dark beer so not a fan of the blue moonish beer. The darker beers were great though"}
{"text":"I don't know how I have never reviewed this place.   I also don't know how to improve upon the 147 reviews here. It is great for lunch or dinner. Beer or food. Groups or couples.   What to order? Well, I am particularly partial to the slow cooked pork sandwich. I ignore more than half the bread, but it is FAN FREAKING TASTIC. I also have seen people gorge themselves on the soup. Yes, I said it, the SOUP. It is supposedly amazing. I would not know because I am so full of pig that I have never attempted the healthier choices!   Anyway you order it, this place rocks! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I used to love this location of the Dane--great parking, good service and yummy food.  I don't know what has happened in the last two months, but it isn't good.   I have never sent food back before in my life until the Great Dane in Fitchburg.  I have now sent back 3 things (all different occasions): hiding burnt rice under the peanut stew; not putting any blue or gorgonzola on the pizza where 'blue' is in the name, and mushed up couscous that was one big gross blob.   I used to love you, Dane! What happened?"}
{"text":"In a town with dozens of brewpubs, I can't really see a reason to come back to the Great Dane. The atmosphere is spot-on of what they're trying to do, but the food and beer just aren't up to snuff.   Between the two of us, we tried 4 of the beers, none of which were good enough that I'd order them again. I wish they had at least a few guest taps at this place for those of us with different taste in beer from their brewer.   The food was also so-so. There were a lot of things on the menu that looked pretty good, and we ordered a reuben and a sustainaburger. The burger was fine, but probably not worth the price tag. The reuben was way below average. The corned beef was fine, but there wasn't enough of it. The sauerkraut was so bland I had to open up the bread and see if it was there. Also, they served the thousand island on the side, which I've NEVER experienced with reuben before, and which prevented the flavors from integrating like they needed to. At least the coleslaw on the side was good. The cheese curds seemed like they'd been poured out of a frozen sysco package.  In summary, food and beer are very mediocre. there is better to be had in every neighborhood in town."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a pint and meal. Comfort food and Craft Beer is hard to beat when it comes to Mad City."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. Rude hostess set the tone. Waitress was too busy texting on her phone to bother for refills. Cold fries to cold with the wrong sandwich but waitress never came back to check on us.  What a waste of $84."}
{"text":"The Friday Night Fish Fry is pretty gross, actually. There are much better places to go for that. I'm not a fan of their beers, either. It's probably a fine spot for an end of night drink and something to soak up the beer in your belly before you make your way home."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Saturday night for the Halloween weekend into a not too crowded place. $5 cover, Jell-O shot included, plus a mini card game for a free brewski. I'll have to come back to edit about the food and beer next time.   My group and I mainly came for drinks and music. We walked up to the second floor where the DJ was getting down! Such a good variety of music. Really nice bar, pool tables, a long shuffle board game. Flat screens with a game on and disco lights. Booth seating with brew taps in the middle.   Our group ordered mixed drinks at the bar and we danced the night away. Good tasting strong drinks.  Cool atmosphere. Definitely a sports bar feel. I really enjoyed two floor separation. Bottom floor was more of the brewery and dining area. You could walk up stairs for more entertainment. I would highly suggest this place for a drinks/dance night out, sports events, or guys night."}
{"text":"FOR SOME REASON SOME OF THE REVIEWS ON YELP GOT MIXED UP SO THE ONE I WROTE FOR THE DOWNTOWN LOCATION IS INCORRECT BUT THIS FITCHBURG LOCATION IS SPECTACULAR!!!  This is such an amazing place and Unique to the Fitchburg area. Out of the 4 Great Danes in Madison, I think this one is by far the best. It just seems to have more character and life to it. It is really warm when you walk in like you have been a customer for years and the staff treats you just the same. They have an unbelievable knack for crafting beers which are delicious and plentiful. They have a gorgeous balcony with a huge grill and of course taps within a 5ft reach. It is gated to keep those pesky kids out and the drunken fun in!  The Great Dane Fitchburg is always so well kept; it's clean and shiny like it had just opened for the first time. Their food is amazing as well! I have had countless items off the menu so there is no one thing that I like more over another. The seats are massive and envelope you and make you feel like your curled up in a big LazyBoy chair while you eat. Don't forget all the massive TV's to watch the games on! Now the 1 coolest thing about this location? Barry Alvarez people! Yeah! He is here on Thursday nights! Anyways, this location has the feeling of class, a warm Fitchburg feeling and really nice people. Especially the staff!"}
{"text":"This place was so packed on a Friday night we have to wait an hour and half for a table. No, we didn't show up at 8 p.m. we strolled in around 5:30.  We bought some drinks while we waited for our table but they were way too expensive. We played some pool while we waited but it was too crowded to get a good shot off. We finally left after two hours because our table wasn't ready and the other group we came with had been seated and started eating.  Don't go late at night."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with a small group of business travelers.  We each tried a different one of the local Great Dane beers, and they were all pretty good (I had the Landmark Lite, which was a pretty good ale).  We had the cheese curds appetizer (when in Wisconsin, right?) and they were very good - not too heavy or greasy.    I and another one of our party had the steak special, which was very flavorful with Cajun seasoning.  The meal also came with a corn and bacon succotash - wow, yum!    When it came time for dessert, I wanted just a little something sweet, so the waitress offered to get me just a single scoop of one of their ice creams.  I had the Scotch Ale Caramel Crunch ice cream and it was REALLY good - plus she only charged me the \"ala mode\" price for the scoop!"}

{"text":"Don't come here for the food. The beer is ok, standard Wisconsin bar alcohol selection. The servers are not too attentive."}
{"text":"Black Earth Porter & Stone of Scone Scotch Ale are very good.  Friendly service and nice atmosphere.  Good quality pub style food.  Always a favorite when we're in the Madison area."}
{"text":"The Great Dane's second location in Fitchburg has never disappointed me over the years.  I'll always love the downtown location and all the hazy memories I have of it from my college years.  However, I find myself in the suburbs these days and you can't always head downtown when you want to meet up with friends for a burger and a beer.  The Fitchburg location of the Dane serves this purpose exceedingly well.  Judging by the crowds that pack this place every night of the week, a lot of people feel this way.  I first graced this establishment with my presence right after the opening, for New Years Eve 2002, and I've been a semi-regular ever since.  During the summer there is not much more enjoyable than sitting out on the deck having a beer and a burger as the sun heads down on the horizon.  During the cooler months the upstairs gaming area is a great place to meet up with friends for some pool or shuffleboard, and you can get food service up there as well.  I have always really enjoyed the food here.  I put the buffalo burger at the top of my list city-wide.  The mushroom gravy that comes with this at first seemed superfluous, because the buffalo burger was so perfectly seasoned that no condiment was required.  That is not to say the gravy went to waste - it is astoundingly good with the fries.  It is so good I have a hard time ordering anything else off the menu.  However, I've branched out on occasion, and I can safely say that the Capital falafel, Mayan chicken wrap and Cajun chicken sandwich are all delicious.  I used to always get the fries, and don't get me wrong I enjoyed them (especially with that gravy), but earlier this year I tried the Israeli cous cous side and this is now my go-to.  The cous cous grains are larger than the traditional style, or at least the kind I make at home, but the seasoning is perfect.  As good as the food is, I really like the Fitchburg Dane because of the beer.  The Great Dane is always known for coming up with a variety of delicious brews, and this is true wherever the location.  What I like about the Fitchburg Dane is that they have several beers that are exclusive to the location.  My personal favorite is the Sugar River ESB - it goes great with a meal or as a stand-alone.  If you're looking for something more sessionable, try the Verruckte Stadt (Mad City auf Deutsch) German Pils.  And if you're going for something rich and creamy, try the Stoner Oatmeal Stout.  The beer is tapped using nitrogen, which gives it an exceptionally smooth mouthfeel.    The only drawbacks that I have with the Fitchburg Dane are almost all a result of the popularity of the place.  Sometimes it's hard to find a parking spot in the nearby garage or on the street.  Other times it's hard to even get a table, but the wait is usually not longer than the time it takes to have a beer at the bar, assuming there's room at the bar.  The service is almost always good, but I've been upstairs and been forgotten once or twice when it's busy.  The price is on the high side compared to some of the other similar places in Madison.  And above all, it can be packed, just like the downtown location.  I suppose you can chalk this up to being a victim of one's own success, and I certainly don't hold it against them."}
{"text":"I honestly have no idea why this place is only getting 3.5 stars. It's a brewery with good food. I mean I can't think of another BREWERY like it in town. Ale Asylum? no way, their food sucks. And they run heavy on pale ales. Cafe Hollander? No way, their food is average and smothered in cheese, not to mention their hard to read beer menu. Hop cat? it's SOMEONE else's beer! and they have.... (drum roll)... fries. To me this is a brewery, not a gastropub. If they got tanks, that's a brewery. And now they \"can\" 2 beers!  Damn you Great Dane! You now have an identity crisis! Is it food? or is it beer? well, I'mma \"both\" kinda gal. Have we really set our brewery standards so low that to add good food means \"average pub\"? Instead of, \"GREAT BREWERY\"?! Aside from a funny tour and an updated beer profile (IPAs and ciders nowadays), Great Dane could rival Lakefront Brewery (don't freak out, I said \"could!\"). But the Great Dane doesn't look traditional. You big ol' goofy dog.  Beer: Well balanced beer list. Not all their beer hits a homerun, but I usually find 2-3 on tap that hits the spot. And they work well with the food. Favs: German Pilsner is great in winter AND summer. Scottish Ale is a less sugary type porter, nice carmel color. Likes: Stout and Pumpkin seasonal. If you absolutely hate their beer, they have a cider + one other local company on tap and liquors.  Food: Easy: their burgers. They also have TURKEY burgers and BEAN burgers. Or you can ask for chicken. They can modify the toppings for you, but I've had Baja, Texarkana, Black and Tan (all, of course, without cheese, or cheese sauce). Their burger bun is woman enough to hold up against the burger and \"stuff.\" I love all these flavors, I just choose a different one depending on the night. (Ordered most often.) 5/5  Tara's Cajun Chicken - blackened isn't too spicy (I like mild salsa), and the sandwich is average, but it's a good size and filling. 4/5  Giant Pretzel - this thing is big! Good app for 2 small tummies or 1 big one. Honey-colored brown with good salting. I love the mustards - they use the pilsner in one and the other is cranberry-ized. Of course deli is on the table. 4/5  Hummus - good size, with kalmata olives/cucumber/tomato/feta cheese, but it's a little dry for me. I ask for olive oil, and it's perfect. They may not like it, but they've given me more pita bread to help finish. RECENT CHANGE: this item comes w/ falafel. 3.75/5  Brown Ale Onion soup - not as salty as French onion, but a deep rich color and flavor. My only complaint here is the soup does not always come out HOT. We ask them to bring it scalding. They probably nuke it, but I hope they oven heat it. (They can do this without cheese.) 4/5  Jamie's Fish Tacos - they use tilapia, in a light breading. you get 3, 4-inch white torn tortillas. Little tomato, lettuce, and the sauces. The BBQ sauce is a tangy sweet. It works for me. The other sauce is a too hot for me, but probably not enough for fire-eaters. (Frequently ordered.) 4/5  Chicken salad croissant - BEST in town. this is a perfect summer item. They have a blend of mayo-chicken ratio that suits me well, and the bacon adds a crunchy quality with good flavor. Overall, this sandwich is a great balance: hot bacon/cold salad, crunchy bacon/mushy salad. The flavor is great. I've had this with the croissant (w/Lactaid), sourdough, and marbled rye. The croissant is \"heavy\" (= buttered!) but airy and so yummy. The rye and sourdough bring their own flavors. Pick your adventure. (Frequently ordered.) 5/5  Fries - are a personal matter. Let's say we all love thin fries like McDonald's, b/c we grew up on these. So Dane fries are Mickie Ds all \"growed up.\" You put 3 McD fries together, you get one Dane fry. But it's not thick like \"crap man, is this still technically a potato?\" Add adult sized salt and flavoring, then deep fry. The golden brown ones are perfection. The golden yellow ones are pretty good too. 5/5  Sunday Brunch - $16 AYCE! Expensive for Madison but well worth it. I mean for $5 more than other brunches ONE entree, you get AYCE?! why not? Salad, salmon, meat station, mashed potatoes, bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, omelette station, diced potatoes, muffins, pancakes, etc. 5/5  Space - large space in all locations. Multiple TVs. Good bar space too. Tables around the bar are first-come-first-serve. Upstairs has games.  Tour - no tour, but you can see their tanks while eating/drinking.  Overall, it's a brewery with good food - to me."}
{"text":"I'm judicious on service, food and quality along with cleanliness, however, I'm always fair and honest.  Additionally I'm also very forgiving and understanding.  I preface this because the 1 star is accurate and with good thought. The food was mediocre at best even for bar food.  Curds were very greasy, fish fry was tasteless bland and greasy.  One positive I would say the brat burger was good and cooked as ordered.  Our server was friendly and somewhat attentive, although her knowledge of cocktails needs to be enhanced.   That was the good. Brandon, who tending bar downstairs was extremely rude, confrontational, and not very good in the service industry.   I will not return and I do not recommend this place.  I suggest the owner re-evaluate the staffs level of service as well as knowledge of easy cocktails (old fashioned)."}
{"text":"Beer is great, wings are delish, the poutine was terrible.... I was looking forward to their version but I was horribly underwhelmed by the lack of presentation and excuse for my appetizer. If you're drunk, try the poutine."}
{"text":"I'm often in Madison for training and have always been looking for a place that I wouldn't find in Chicago. This is the place.  At first glance, I expected a Goose Island experience: good brews but mediocre pub food. Fortunately, this was not the case. The menu reads like a daily newspaper and after further inspection, this place was legit. It offered typical burgers and pub fare but start throwing in entrees like Cedar Planked Chive Buttered Salmon and Tandoori Chicken and you are just sucking up to the teacher! I ordered Mad City Mama's BBQ Meatloaf as the main entree and the Beer Battered Cheese Curds for starters. The Cheese Curds were just overglorified mini mozzarella sticks and were ok. The meatloaf however? Just like Big Mama alright! Okkkaaaaay! It was very delicious.  Another reason why the place is great to visit are their sampler packs where you can choose from 4 to 10 four oz samples of their brews. I got the ten pack, which was probably bad because I must have looked like that man who had a baby with all the food and beer.  Overall, a great experience. Too legit, too legit to quit. Hay haaaayyy! (No, I am not drunk while I'm writing this)."}
{"text":"The menu has variety for many tastes in your group, and not just bar food (nice). The prices are pretty fair. Just know that if you go on a weekend evening, the wait could be long and the place is quite loud if you want to talk to your friends over a meal vs. shout at them.   Tried the Pepper Beer and was quite surprised by the green pepper flavor that was a little sweet and the lingering spice on the finish. Normally don't like pepper beers too much, but want to because I love hot food so much. I'd buy it again! I ate the turkey burger and was very satisfied with it - good flavor.   This place gets 3 stars overall because of the long wait we had and it was crazy loud. Food and beer would get a 4 star (but that's not an option here on Yelp)."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! I can't think of any reason to give Great Dane anything less than 5 stars. Traditional pub food, sprinkled with the occasional surprise- the African peanut stew is to die for. And the Big 10 Veggie burrito- the single best burrito I've ever tasted, and that's saying a lot considering I lived in Arizona for 5 years!  The Doty St. location in the summer is ideal...counting the days until I can enjoy a Cherry Ale on the patio!!"}
{"text":"Great German pilsner, pretzel brat burger, & wait staff!  Very cool beer garden & historic building."}
{"text":"How is it i have never reviewed the Great Dane? If you live in Madison, you know how great this place is. If you are visiting Madison - you need to go here."}
{"text":"I was really impressed by the menu. My husband had the pork cooked in a banana leaf, I had the curry noodle bowl. Both were very flavorful. The kids menu has typical kid stuff (nuggets, etc.). We shared the Mediterranean plate, but that was pretty typical hummus, pita, veggies.  The beer was excellent, we tried stone of scone scotch ale and devil red.  The food came out really quickly, and the service staff was attentive. Is would recommend it to anyone visiting Wisconsin looking for a great brew pub."}
{"text":"Brewpubs tend to be my first target whenever I visit a new city. Great Dane happened to be a couple blocks away from the punk rock show we descended upon Madison for. I was stoked... until their beer touched my lips.  It is very, very difficult for me NOT to finish a beer, no matter the circumstances: bodily capacity, time constraints, ore even a little Armageddon. But I actually abandoned some of my Crop Circle Wheat because it had become unpalatable 2/3 through the very generous pour. I enjoy wheat and citrus-y beers, but couldn't manage to finish a glass of it.   The fact that a pair of fruit flies kept landing and launching off my lemon slice every sip didn't earn this brewpub any favors, either.  NOM'd: Crop Circle Wheat"}
{"text":"Local restaurant chains have many of the challenges of large chains, but seem to lack the expertise to handle them well.   So the food at the Great Dane is OK. It could be much better with a little care in preparation and presentation.   The waitstaff and hosts are among the least interested people I've encountered in the service business -- which is too bad, since many of TGD's problems could be remedied by people who care a little more about the customer.  And now, with many dining options in Madison offering extensive beer selections, The Great Dane might want to pay a little more attention to improving the basics."}
{"text":"I get this place is a staple in Madison. Everyone says to go here and try it, so I did. The space is huge, maybe too big as it felt a bit lonely with all that drafty space? I sat at the bar and ordered a tasting.  Good: I like any bar that is proud to be a plain, simple, working class dive joint. I'm always comfortable in this setting, so while I found the place to be too big to be intimate, I did like the energy of the place and the other patrons there. It was a fun, young, lively crowd. The bartender was very friendly too.  Bad: food menu. Nothing remotely healthy to order. It's greasy bar food, so that means nachos, fries, etc. I wasn't feeling any of it the night I went so i did not order anything. It just didn't read appetizing to me.  Beer. Not a fan. They offer a huge tasting as they apparently brew a ton of varieties. Not sure that's such a good thing? Much like I feel about Rogue Brewery, I think offering a ton of crappy to average beers is not good business. I'd rather they focus on a small variety of beers that taste great. Quality over quantity, people. The Old Glory Pale Ale was the one I enjoyed the most but it was totally average in the grand scheme of things. The Scottish Ale needs to be taken out back and shot and should never again see the light of day. :)"}
{"text":"A micro-brewery with absolutely delicious food!  This place was an absolute must-stop restaurant whenever my parents came to visit me in Madison, and I still go nearly every time I'm back in town.  My favorites include the Wingra wings with Asian BBQ sauce, the Great Dane burger with creamy, garlicky spinach-artichoke sauce, and my absolute favorite - Thai chicken salad that comes with homemade brown beer bread.  The best drink to wash this all down is the light  Crop Circle Wheat beer, served with lemon.  Yum, yum, yum!!  If the weather's nice, enjoy your food outdoors in the ivy-walled patio/beer garden with cute black metal tables, or indoors upstairs in the spacious wooden booths if it's getting chillier outside, or if you're bar-hopping, check out the downstairs billiards bar with views of the micro-brewery at work.  The Halloween Haunted House was also a fun time. ;)  Gotta hit this place up if you're in town!"}
{"text":"Was in town for a quick business meeting.  Stopped by for lunch  I had the Cuban sandwich and thought it was one of the better ones I've had.  Would certainly come back here if I'm in town again."}
{"text":"A friend and I stumbled upon this place on a road trip through Wisconsin.  We both really liked it.  There was a good sized crowd and no one was particularly obnoxious.  We were expecting to see some crazy shit due to its proximity to UW, but it was pretty laid back.  Most college kids probably don't think about microbrews in the quest to get as plastered as possible.  Their prices were reasonable, and it was nice to be in a smoke-free environment in the heart of WI.  I can imagine if the kids decide to go here more often, the atmosphere will suffer, but in the meantime those who enjoy a nice beer or two in a fun environment will still have a place to go."}
{"text":"The beer... was underwhelming.  Ordered two different IPAs and was not impressed with either.  Cheese curds were okay.  Sauces seemed thin, but decent flavor.    Had the Texarkana burger (because the waiter said they're known for their burgers)...  the burger was okay, cooked as requested, but the beef patty could be bigger, as you could taste more bun than meat.  I'll possibly comeback, but order differently next time..."}
{"text":"Wow!  Went to the Eastside locate (the only one without on site brewing). Four (count 'em) four locations; use your GPS to find the one closet to you. A great selection of beers and an extensive menu. Wasted my time last PM at the Ale Asylum, this place beats it hands down. One reviewer stated \"loud, loud, loud\" and it is; but, it's fun. Great ambiance. Great personable service. Making me wish I never moved away from Madison."}
{"text":"I've been a frequent patron of the Great Dane for over a decade, and there is good reason.  First, the beer is brewed on location and they have an amazing menu.  Add in the fun ambience and accommodating wait staff and you have a great restaurant.    If you're in Madison long enough, you'll hear people mention Crop Circle Wheat more than a few times.  It's the best beer the Dane brews.  All the other beers are good too.  You can do a beer sampler if you want to find some other favorites.   There aren't many places that can say they have awesome meatloaf, ravioli, nachos and burgers.  Somehow, the Dane can straddle all of these different flavors and do them extremely well.  That's part of why I have come here so often; no matter what the people in your group want, they can get it here.  You can have many different types of experiences at the Dane based on where you are seated.  The front bar area is super fun and chill if you want to shoot pool, darts, play the jukebox or just watch sports.  The dining area on the top floor is casual and great for groups.  In the basement, you take your own tour of the Dane brewing process, which is fun in itself.  Eating dinner in the basement is more intimate, as its a bit darker with the stone walls.  The best place to eat though is the back beer patio.  On a sunny day or a cool night, its a fun experience that makes the Dane feel like a fancy restaurant without having to pay for it.  Staff is awesome.  Just tell them what you want, they'll help you out.  We used to rent out the Dane for large group events, and they were always helpful.    The Great Dane is an essential Madison experience."}
{"text":"Food is decent and the beer is pretty good. Setup at his Great Dane is much better than the one towards Fitchburg. If you're looking for a hangout spot for some beer and games, then this place is for you. There are also some tables in a quieter portion for a family meal. Definitely a younger demographic on the weekend evenings."}
{"text":"I had the fish fry and beer sampling here, so i can only review based on the quality of the food and not how great of a place this is to come after a couple of drinks for a late night snack. The fish here was on the greasy side and the batter was not well seasoned. All in all, this restaurant served a forgettable fish fry.  However, the beer selection here was not so bad. The atmosphere of the restaurant was also nice, with a pub type feel too it.   All in all, satisfactory beer selection with forgettable food, a place to be trashed and snack and get more trashed."}
{"text":"This won't be one of my normal long reviews. Tonight just short and sweet.  The beer is very good and they have a decent selection. The cheese curds are just like everyone says, simply amazing. The main course how ever was super impressive. I ordered the German sausages and they were very good but the sides were not so impressive and took away from the main dish.   The ambiance is nice; I can see myself coming back and trying one of the burgers I hear others raving about."}
{"text":"Another awesome experience. Went with the baja burger this time, totally amazing!"}
{"text":"The tuna salad is wonderful. The beer is hit or miss. I much prefer new glaurus beer. The outside sitting area in the garden is lovely."}
{"text":"I have been to the Great Dane for dinning and for just drinking on several occasions. I love the layout of the building and the decor. The Dane burger is great. I also enjoy the meatloaf. If you just want appetizers I recommend the nachos, soft pretzels and artichoke dip! Of course you can't forget the beer sampler!"}
{"text":"My Type of Place!  My wife and I fly into your town and we start chatting with our hotel shuttle driver. We start chatting about food, beer, etc... I tell him like pilsners and I'm not a fan of IPAs. He immediately recommends the Great Dane. I'm like cool, the Yelpers in town recommended this place on a thread I started. We check in, unpack, and off we go.  The Arrival  We walk in and the first thing I notice is the beautiful smell.  Only true beer drinkers can appreciate this smell. It's a perfume of brewers yeast and hops which is both intoxicating and delightful. A smile like the Grinch that stole Christmas creeps across my face. Is this heaven? No it's Madison, Wisconsin:)  So, we walk in the pool room area, but all the seats at the bar were taken. So we walk on the other side and plop down at the bar. We meet our bartender Jenny and she is sweet as pie. I get a flight of beers and I would say they have a pretty nice selection. For you Pilsner drinkers, this is money. They have more selections of that style that any brewery I've been too. I settle on the Landmark Lite, but I did enjoy the taste of the Pecks Pils and the Pumpkin Ale. The Landmark Lite is so smooth with no aftertaste at all. This is easy drinking at its finest and for me it's perfect.   The Food  We only had two apps, the assorted pretzel basket and the onion soup. The pretzel basket had four or five different types of fresh baked pretzels. Now the pretzels were awesome, but the show stealer was the Crop Circle Wheat Cranberry Mustard. My wife originally placed it to the side because she thought it was marinara sauce. I tasted it and said that's some sort of mustard. We both were a little shocked. I looked at the menu and yes this was truly a red looking mustard. I dip a pretzel piece into this red concoction and take a bite. WOW. The flavor profile will knock your socks off. First you taste the cranberry with it's sweet and then as it settles in your mouth you get the heat of the mustard. The heat I am talking about is compared to Hot Chinese Mustard where it reaches your sinuses. I'm not taking about that sorry ass Chinese mustard in the plastic packages, I'm taking about the one that comes in a small plastic cup. This cranberry mustard doesn't reach the sinus level of a Hot Chinese Mustard, but you can feel it. I need to shake the hand of the person who came up with this recipe. Whoever you are, you are a genius and if I could I'd have your children;) which reminds me, I need to buy some of that to take home to South Florida. Next up the Onion Soup. The cheese was melted to a prefect crust, which I love. I broke it up with my spoon and swooped in for the kill. Very tasty and not salty at all. The onions had that silky texture which is a must with this style of soup.  Ambiance   Open, inviting, and very clean. Service was very friendly and there is no doubt that this joint is popular with community. I would be a regular if I lived here.  Verdict   Listen, I know I'm a tourist and this was my first time here, but I know beer and food. This place has IT.  I feel very confident with rating this brewery a 5. I'll be back before I fly back home. Remember to tell Jenny that Dan from Ft. Lauderdale sent you and Stay Hungry!"}
{"text":"I know there's probably better options in Madison, but more often than not this Milwaukeean finds herself back at a Great Dane. There's something to be said for comfort and consistency.   This location is central, easy to meet folks at and has so many options for seating - bar, patio, basement, restaurant ...  The food is always solid and the menu is so varied that I can pretty much always find something to suit my mood, which is nice. From sandwich and soup and creamy mac and cheese to the sinfully amazing brat/burger/bacon amazingness, I really have never been unhappy with a meal here.   There's a city parking garage on the block, which is convenient.   The bar can be loud, but I love how cozy the basement is. They do shuttles to various Badger events.   The Great Dane is just solid. I know I'm going to get good beer and guood food. And the food is the yummy comfort food that fills you up and prepares you to step out into a Wisconsin winter, you know?  Great for pre- or post-game, great to meet friends and linger over extra drinks."}
{"text":"I'm laughing as I write this as I've just come from this bar and had a great time! Great Dane Pub and Brewing is the kind of bar that I would make my neighborhood joynt if it was in my neighborhood.   Great Dane has been in business since 1994 and is the first brewery to open in Madison since 1966. The building is amazing (you know me and my love for old buildings!)- it is split between a Queen Ann style and a Victorian brick both looking to be from the early to mid 1800's. There is a historic plaque outside that explains that this was once a fine hotel in Madison. The remodeling showcases the interior brick walls, a mahogany bar and a rathskeller in which the beer is made. But the coolest spot? An outdoor garden with brick pavers and up lighting makes this one of the best al fresco dining areas in the city.   The bartender took care of me until my friends arrived- offering me samples of their local brewed goodness cuz I couldn't make up my mind. He knew all along just what I would like (sorry Dave- should have listened to you from the start!)   We moved to a table with the gang arrived and had some tasty appetizers and burgers. When in Wisconsin- do as they do so everything we had was laden with cheese- deep fried cheese curds, nachos buried in cheese and meat and even a cheddar melt burger with onions and cheese. Now this was calorie worthy grub!   Like playing pool or shuffleboard? They've got your game! And there is live music (so I am told) Thursday through Sunday. The staff is friendly and quick- keeping the beers flowing and the food coming.   Dinner for 6 was around $80. Cheap, cheap cheap. But fun.   And the best news of all? Walking distance from the hotel (although there is a parking garage next door) You can bet the next time I am in Madison- the Great Dan Pub will be on my list to visit!"}
{"text":"Fast , extremely friendly and professional service, beer is awesome, last night I enjoyed the Devils lake red , and one of the best burgers I've ever eaten (texacana) , 5 stars guys.  This one was a good find! I forgot to mention the cheese curds, AMAZING , MELT IN YOUR MOUTH , BUT A CRUNCHY OUTSIDE , PERFECTION"}
{"text":"We would probably eat here again. Menu sounded good but we ended up getting everything packed up to go since my son was not having a good day and they seemed busy and I didn't want to take up a table with a tantrumming little one."}
{"text":"As brewpubs go, I think this is the best in Madison.  The food is great, and the beer is very good.  While I prefer the downtown location for its atmosphere and garden seating, the Fitchburg location is a bit more convenient for a west-sider and parking is never a problem.  All of the Great Dane standard beers are good, although I've tasted a few \"misses\" in their seasonal and special varieties (like the watermelon wheat, yuck), but favorite/stand-by is the Scotch Ale.  The Dane is on my list of \"must visits\" when friends and family come to town."}
{"text":"I went for the first time yesterday after a Badgers basketball game.  It was slow - unusual for Madison on a Saturday night, but I guess everyone was still recovering from turkey-itis.  My dinner was excellent - I had the Southwest Tortellini.  The serving was large enough that I took some home & had lunch.  Mmmmm it was so good :)  I was a little hesitant to eat there, actually, because I was expecting \"bar food,\" but it's actually a pretty classy restaurant with an excellent menu.  My boyfriend had the brat/burger/pretzel roll concoction.  It was pretty tough to actually eat, just because it's HUGE - but he expected that when he ordered it.  He liked it, though.  I don't think he was so fond of the baked beans, he mentioned that they were in a tomato sauce?  The waitress wasn't annoying - it took us a long time to decide what we wanted because there were so many things that looked good, and she wasn't back every five seconds asking if we were ready YET.  She waited til we put down our menus & then she came right over - even though by that time it had begun to get realllllly busy in there.  The food came out quickly & our drinks were great.  They don't seem to have a huge selection of liquor, and I don't drink beer - but there was enough for me to choose from.  Several of the vodkas that I later saw on the menu weren't displayed on the bar, so I ended up getting one drink when I would've preferred something else, had I known they had it - I wish they'd put ALL their boozes up on the wall ;)  My boyfriend said the beer was great.  I was really impressed & I'd definitely go back to try out all the other things that looked great on the menu."}
{"text":"Huge beer selection. We only tried a couple beers, but both were very tasty and well done. Very friendly service from the bar staff as well."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a really nice and simple lunch here at the bar,  I had a buffalo burger with \"local\" cheese served on a multigrain focaccia.  It was served medium well which is perfect for buffalo; since it's leaner than most meat many restaurants overcook it, not here! I appreciated the option to have dipping veggies instead of fries or a surcharge soup/salad; they were crisp and fresh.  I paired this with a very nice prairie fume white wine. Yes, I know they brew beer but I've just never been a beer person, give a girl a break. It's so refreshing to have a choice from more than one red and one white when choosing a none-beer beverage at a brewery restaurant!       The service was very friendly and attentive, although the server did seem a bit stressed.  I'd return here for a simple meal any day."}
{"text":"First review on Yelp!   I used to live right next to the Great Dane in Fitchburg and also have always gone to the Great Dane downtown. When I did live next to the restaurant I ate there 2-3 times a week. (about a year and a half ago) since I moved I always craved their burgers. Recently went back for the first time since and I was deeply disappointing. I rarely eat in since I am never at home I like to eat at my house. I got the Dane burger and all of it was sad. (did not even finish my food) First off I loved their old eco-friendly fiber to-go boxes since they sucked in the condensation and did not make my fries and burger bun soggy. Even tho with the fries soggy they were still good as always. Next my burger was not the same as before seemed like it was half the size and was overcooked. The bun it came with was different then before: stale, huge and gross. On top of everything the lettuce that was on my burger... rotten.  Grew up in the restaurant industry and the quality of this restaurant just went down."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The staff was incredibly rude and disrespectful. It was made very clear that customer satisfaction was the least of their concerns. I would highly recommend finding somewhere else downtown as there are many wonderful restaurants that far outshine this one."}
{"text":"Been here dozens of times over the years and was always pleased but not thrilled. Now that I've been diagnosed with diabetes I have a new appreciation of their menu.  I have many more healthy options than similar restaurants and I have relied on the manager for advice.  A new favorite."}
{"text":"The Great Dane has come to believe in its own mythmaking, I'm afraid.  Fatal to a company, in my experience, when it forgets the heart of its own purported mission.    Trying to book a party for a boy turning 13, making a once in a lifetime trip to Scotland this year - he won the trip, entirely on his merits and hard work; only group from the United States to be so honored - and we got nothing but corporate speak and rudeness from Noel, the GM.  A very short bagpiper tune - something my wife actually booked for my OWN birthday, at the SAME place, with absolutely no issues - and a party reservation for about 8; A favorite Noel quote would have to be \"Your kid isn't the only one going someplace special this year.\"  I also was especially warmed by \"market model\" and associated other corporate-speak.  Oh, to add, when I informed Noel I couldn't but post my experiences online, \"so, you're going to leave a negative review just because you didn't get your way?\"  Um, yep, that's kind of how it works, Noel.  Not only did we not \"get our way,\" but your empty corporate speak and absolute rudeness and contemptuous dismissal of something already done at your place, well, added up to \"hit the road - we're too big.\"    Got it, Big Dane.  You are not the company I knew - and knew well, when I used to sit with Rob LoBreglio sipping with him and sharing my thoughts on some of his earlier experiments (I was in the trade, Goose Island).  Some may enjoy your pub food and beer, once a nice part of living in Madison.  You've lost this person's business, for good."}
{"text":"I've been to two branches of Great Dane for lunch,Downtown And Hilldale Mall,both good.I remember lunch at Hilldale being particularly good.Surprisingly they have outstanding onion soup.I was also impressed by the steamed bratwurst .The beer is solid if not that memorable."}
{"text":"Peanut stew was delicious. Waited twenty minutes for a table on a Wednesday, but our dinner came out quickly. Only complaint was that the red lager I ordered was the worst I've ever tasted, but my parents enjoyed the Scotch ale and wheat beer they ordered."}
{"text":"Food was good and the bar tender knows how to make sure patrons are happy."}
{"text":"One of several in the GD chain.  The Dotty location is still the best. Food   Pub fair with some variety done pretty well.  The menu has quite a variety with things like a pesto pasta that's pretty good.  I've always enjoyed the Buffalo Chicken, the Poutine is pretty good although the gravy comes off as a bit generic/canned variety.    Beer   They brew some good brews and a pretty wide variety.  Last visit saw 17 different beers on tap.  A good place to grab a sampler and try something new along with the styles you already know you like.  Service   Service is average and mixed depending on my visits.  Can be a bit slow during busy periods, otherwise usually meets expectations.  Location   This place is huge with a small outdoor area that is not visible from the street, but makes for a nice quiet meal.  The basement is usually the best place to find a seat on a really busy night.  The bar is separate from the restaurant, nice for a family or those looking to not spend their time near someone elses."}
{"text":"It's good, not great.  Nothing to write home about.  Varied menu items and service was good.  I don't see why all the rave reviews and excitement over this place."}
{"text":"Great beer, great food! Right near the capitol."}
{"text":"I flat-out REFUSED to go to the Dane in college but now that I'm all grown up, I've changed my mind.  It can be over-crowded (and perhaps over-rated?) but they've got decent (or better) food (with diverse enough choices to please almost anyone) plus they serve Strongbow Hard Cider in addition to their many fine brews.  The garden, which I believed to be an urban myth in college, actually exists and is quite lovely.  And, it's a great place to bring out-of-towners for a \"taste of Madison.\"  Finally - their newer location in Fitchburg has a wonderful deck and a bit older, post-college bar crowd."}
{"text":"Not what it used to be. Went with a group Saturday night. Everyone's food was served cold (burgers) or soggy (salad). IPA was bad - they said it was their second night with a bad tap. For a brewing company that's disappointing. The wings were no good - the chicken wasn't great quality and didn't have much meat. Service was slow and wouldn't ever return."}
{"text":"If you go to Madison Wisconsin you have to stop by the Great Dane.  I think it might actually be a law in Wisconsin or something.  But seriously, the Great Dane has to be Madison's most famous bar and has been a staple there for decades.  I have been to the capitol area Great Dane location probably a half dozen times over the past 10 years.  The food is always excellent, the beer is always really good, and the atmosphere is always great.    If you go during the warmer parts of the year, I would recommend sitting outside.  They have a really cool outside eating area.  One last thing, in all the times I've been there, the staff has always been great.  College kids that don't take things too seriously so they can be fun.  Definitely visit the Great Dane when you are in Madison, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The building is beautiful inside and out. Parking can be tough but there is a garage next to it. We went for lunch on a Saturday and it was very buisy, people never stopped coming through the door. Good that they have a patio, second bar area and a bar down stairs with more seating. This place was big and old, one door still had the name of a previous hotel in old fancy letters. Old wood all over the place and it's a throw back to another time. Service was good for the crushing amount of people in the place. I had the scotch ale which was good but I was informed it's not there best choice for beer. I had the bacon cheese burger rare with the garlic mash instead of Fry's. The burger was good, see the picture. The burger was cooked perfect and had cheddar cheese, lettuce, bacon, tomatoe, red onion, pickles on a good roll. No ketchup etc and I ate it just how they served and it was a good burger. This mash potatoes were very good with some red skins left in and that wonderful garlic flavor, much better than Fry's in my opinion. The food took a little long but not that long for the massive amount of people in the placs which was ok because we had our drinks to work on. This is a nice place to get together for food and drinks and I would go back again. Bottom line it's a great place with lots of character and I can see why they have a crushing following, I would not want to work that kitchen for sure. Good job."}
{"text":"Good food for the most part, with a few issues  I have eaten at this location a lot, mostly because it is very close to my apartment. If you stick with burgers, cheese curds, wings, fries, and beer, this place is fine.   The only problem I have with the burgers is that they are consistently overcooked. Each of the six burgers I have ordered here on separate visits came out WELL done (no pink and rather dry), although I ordered medium.  I am not too picky about my burgers, so I didn't complain. I will say that I have never had this problem at the downtown location--that location always cooks it exactly medium.   I had a similar problem with the steak salad. I ordered it once to-go, and it was rare (blood on the lettuce). I assumed this was their standard, so a few weeks later I tried it again in the restaurant and asked for it medium. This, too, arrived rare. The waitress agreed it was not medium and offered to cook it further. Unfortunately when it came back it was a tough, charred mess. I ended up splitting my husband's meal.  I've had less-than-perfect experiences with other items. I recently ordered a wrap and it was so loosely wrapped that when I picked it up everything fell out. Also, instead of cutting the wrap cleanly in half they appeared to tear it, giving each end largely uneven, jagged lines and making it awkward to bite into. Also, parts of the flour tortilla were dry and crunchy, as if it had been sitting out a while. I wasn't a fan of their soups or pasta either (seemed very salty).   My advice if you go here: Order the boneless wings with Asian barbeque sauce. It comes with a blue cheese ranch dipping sauce that is very good. I have never had a bad beer here, but my personal favorite is Crop Circle Wheat. If you do order a burger, I would suggest ordering it a level rarer than you normally would."}
{"text":"I travel to Madison frequently for work.  I have eaten at several Great Dane locations, so I don't know that this is necessarily a fair representation of the location I'm reviewing.    I quite like the Great Dane at the airport.  I always make a point of arriving at the airport early for my flight, regardless, so it's good to go there and have a few (or maybe 10) drinks and a little bite while catching up on emails and such. I highly recommend the tomato basil soup as a lunch, or maybe an afternoon snack.  I visited another location with a friend--not sure which location, since I don't know the city well--and I had what must have been a daily special, because I don't see it on the menu at the web site. It was a roast beef sandwich that was really quite salty. Something has to be extremely salty for me to object, but object I had to. The side dish of white cheddar grits was really just instant grits with a few cheddar shavings on top. Not good enough. The waiter very kindly replaced my meal with a very good soup from the menu--the potato and bacon soup, which I highly recommend.   On another occasion I visited the location on Doty St., and had Mad City Mama's BBQ Meatloaf.  Although I'm not crazy about barbecue sauce per se, it was not overpowering, and the meat loaf was pretty good.  The garlic mashed potatoes could have used more garlic. I was satisfied with that meal.  My overall recommendation?  Pretty good, especially if you like beer. I'm not a beer afficionado, so much of what the restaurant offers is lost on me. Still, I'd go back for more food."}
{"text":"At the recommendation of a friend I went here for dinner. The scotch ale was pretty good, but nothing too special. I tried the poutine (fries covered in cheese curds, and chicken gravy) as an appetizer, which were pretty tasty and a at a good price ($6). For dinner, I ordered the petite cut sirloin.  It was indeed small (about 6oz), but had a good flavor. They served it with caramelized onions and sauteed mushrooms, mashed potatoes and mixed veggies were the sides. They have a section in the menu about how they cook to temperature, but my medium steak was medium well. The steak had a good taste, but wasn't incredibly tender. They have a nice outside patio which is great for nice nights in the summer.  Pros: nice outdoor patio, friendly staff Cons: food isn't anything special"}
{"text":"Just left the Great Dane in Fitchburg.  We ate on the patio.  Food was OK,  but we were in a smoker's convention.  Most people around us, and at the outside bar were smokers.  I would recommend that the hostess inform guests at the time of seating that smoking is allowed in that area.  You would at least know in advance before being seated and ordering.  We have been there several times in the past but had always sat inside until this evening.  Now we know better.  Our clothes and hair smell like smoke, and we are stuffed up.  Beth & Dave"}
{"text":"Amazing place -- really nice interior, and extraordinary big garden patio with high ivy-lined walls. The food menu is surprisingly large and eclectic -- not just pub food -- with great vegetarian options. The beers are not consistently great, but they are consistently interesting. Also great prices."}
{"text":"We started off with the poutine - it was delicious! Super good and just the right amount of gravy. The service was a little slow in the beginning (15m to get beer and waters) but service sped up halfway through. The chicken Cesar salad wrap was delicious - refreshing and not too heavy. The onion soup had lots of yummy cheese - however was a little too salty. Overall, a good family style restaurant."}
{"text":"Another of Madison's microbrewery joints.  This one is quite spacious, especially after expanding into the antique market next door and building out a huge billiards room and new bar.  The downstairs area features a secluded backyard patio surrounded by ivy-covered walls reminescent of a New Orleans cafe.  Cool place."}
{"text":"After spending a ridiculous amount of time searching for a restaurant that apparently didn't exist, we stumbled into the Great Dane exhausted, peeved and borderline crazed.   Almost like they sensed this, we were shown the way to a darling outdoor patio and brought us 2 of the Black Earth Porter, which was a super dark, rich beer that really hit the spot.   So then I order a cup of the Chicken Peanut Soup. Nice balance of peanut vs the other ingredients and enough flavour to stop my peanut craving that day. Then I went and ordered the fish tacos (which I do have one gripe about - don't list them on your menu as $2.50 each and then when I ask for 2 say \"oh its a minimum of three\". That's really stupid. At least change the menu to say \"$7.50 for three and $2.50 each additional!\")   Anyway the fish tacos were lovely, very fresh, full of cilantro and plump white fish. They also come with 2 sauces, a chipotle BBQ (which was too sweet and kind of overpowered the fish) and a habanero hellfire sauce. Can I get a \"HOT DAMN!\" for that sauce! Because, yeah, its pretty friggin hot! You have to know that I put the whole cup of sauce onto one taco, in a dimly lit area of the patio around 9 at night. Had I not been someone who eats incredibly hot peppers on a pretty regular basis, this sauce might have knocked me unconcious from the shock of how spicy it was. So bewarned! But I might come back just for that sauce, that's how freakin awesome it was.   A fantastic find - almost glad we couldnt find that other place!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"i'm a fan of the devil's lake red lager, which was surprisingly flat & bitter on my last visit. food's just okay--fried cheese curds, chicken wings & nachos were typical, burger a disappointment. that being said, i always somehow end up here, and i like it. it's probably been my most visited bar since moving to madison this past summer, so i kinda just dig it's familiarity. bartenders & staff are cute & helpful. capital square location makes the crowd less young & douchey. nice to have a new go to bar when you move, and this place will surely keep me bloated & tipsy."}
{"text":"I have eaten in the dining room of here before, however, this review is based on take out.  The parking is great as it does have a parking structure, albeit somewhat small. The staff was quite friendly upon arrival and the place has that hometown brewery feeling to it.   The hostess was not put out in the least that I was requesting take out. She politely handed me a menu and directed me to the bar to place my order. From start to finish, I was in and out in about 15 or so minutes. Not bad at all. The bartender was very nice and again not put off that I was just ordering food and not sitting down for a beverage.  The food is pretty good here. I would say a kick above pub food as there are somewhat healthy alternatives. The only complaint I have is that they did not include any place settings for the order...even though I requested them to. Not the end of the world, that is what we have fingers and hotel towels for."}
{"text":"Oh Great Dane. I've been to all of their establishments, and the service is always good and the food is good, too."}
{"text":"The Dane has the best beer in town. For that reason alone you should check it out. It also has a great outdoor area in the back when it is warm enough outside. Sometimes I believe the servers think the beer sells itself and therefore could care less about giving good service. Unfortunately they might be right. The food is good but not great."}
{"text":"Although the atmosphere of this restaurant seemed promising, my experience here was lackluster at best. Our server seemed pretty disinterested and rushed for no apparent reason since it wasn't busy at all when we were there. We got several comments like \"You guys didn't need any more water, did you?\" and had to call them back a few times as they rushed off without seeing if anyone else at our table needed anything.   When our party asked some questions about the beer selection, we were met with really generic comments that sounded like our server didn't really know much about the beer and was just trying to say anything at all. I'd rather my server admit that they weren't sure and ask someone who had a better idea. \"I dunno, it kinda has like, that... flavor to it, you know what I'm talking about?\"   When it came to ordering food, I was puzzled to see so much variety on the menu. Mixed with standard Wisconsin pub fare of burgers, brats, and cheese curds, there were random Caribbean jerk dishes? Falafel and couscous? I think there was some kind of Thai/Asian dish as well? It weirds me out to see that much variation, because in my experience that leads to weak dishes that won't really stand on their own.   I decided to play it safe and order the Mac and Cheese with Buffalo chicken. Meh. It was advertised as being garnished with a wedge of cheese (which had me sold) and a soft pretzel. The pretzel was a small, square, semi-stale, cold pretzel roll and there was no wedge of cheese. The cheese sauce was bland and thin, the pasta was overcooked and mushy, and the slices of chicken breast were clearly not slices cut from a chicken breast but were those fast-food chewy chicken slices that are spongy and don't have much flavor. Yuck.  My friends were happy about the beers they ordered though, so maybe this place stands up better as a brewery where you can order their flights, and not depend so much on the food. As it stands, this place was a waste of my money and I won't be back to give it a second chance."}
{"text":"A great place for a burger and a craft beer.  I had the pleasure of having the Texarkana burger. The atmosphere was pleasantly cool.  The only draw back was finding parking close to the restaurant. The bartender recommend the food and it was delicious. I highly recommend this place for a burger."}
{"text":"The service and food are always top notch. If you haven't tried it before, go for the Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"I've been to the downtown Great Dane, but more to the Hilldale site.  Good stuff.  Really."}
{"text":"We had a large group from out of town and called to see if we could make a reservation for 12. No, too small. We arrived before 6:00 on a Saturday and were told that it would be a 90 minute wait. Eventually, we were told that we could order in the waiting area of the bar, which worked out well. The beer curds weren't fresh or warm. My burger was edible, but nothing special. My colleagues reported that their meals were similar: edible, not particularly fresh, but not gross. A few had positive comments about the beer. I suppose this wasn't a disastrous meal, but it wasn't worth the money and wasn't very good."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place. They have a decent Bloody Mary - and it comes with a pretty good-sized beer chaser (~5oz?) My burger was cooked just right and was pretty amazing (though the pretzel bun was a little too big. I hate it when the bread overtakes the innards. Plus, because of the size of the bun it's almost impossible to get that burger+brat into your mouth. The menu is also too big for me - I just don't think that any restaurant should try to do so many things. First of all, they won't do them ALL well. Second, it's harder than hell for people to make decisions when they are hungry. BUT, the food was good, the service friendly, and the location was right next to the furniture store we came into town to check out. Overall pretty solid place to get some pub food, drinks, and good service. I'd go back if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Really, I would equate this place to a BJ's. Where they have just enough in-house beers to call themselves a brewery, but they're all run-of-the-mill. Their food is also just typical pub fare, nothing to write home about. Overall, just average."}
{"text":"The Great Dane Pub, great food, great beer, great atmosphere, great everything!  I really enjoy going to the Dane.  I went for lunch on a Friday afternoon (well, been there many times, finally got around to writing a review).  I had the Dane Burger, and wow, just as good as I had remembered it from previous times.  Juicy, fresh, tasty, and topped with the Dane's own Spinach Artichoke Dip.  I paired it with the Kohl Slaw, so tasty and fresh as well.  As an appetizer, my friends and I split the cheese curds, which are a must when you are in Madison! The beer, so good!  I had the seasonal Oktoberfest which was on tap, and this beer has a great caramel maltiness balanced nicely by the hops.  If you are in Madison and need some food and beer, go to the Great Dane, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I stopped here while on a trip to Wisconsin.  The food was absolutely delicious!  The black and tan brownie was well worth the calories; I could not believe how amazingly good it was.  I may drive the two hours from where I'm working to visit this restaurant again before heading back home....it's that good"}
{"text":"Each Great Dane location consistently has the worst service in Madison. On a recent trip, we waited 45 minutes for a table (which is typical, so we didn't mind) but then once we were seated, the waiter didn't come over and great us for nearly 20 minutes. This is after we had asked the hostess if we even had a waiter. On a different occasion, our appetizer was forgotten. The slowest service ever as well.  They're lucky their food is so good and beer excellent. But don't come hungry because you will be waiting for awhile."}
{"text":"Both the beer and solid pub food make this Madison brewpub a go-to for casual bites after work or golf. The burgers are great. Vegetarians can find many choices on the menu."}
{"text":"I really really want to give this place more than 2 stars because I have been to other locations and liked them quite a bit. And truthfully the food was quite good. However the service was severely, SEVERELY lacking.  Positives: Like I said, food was good. Drinks were brought promptly, etc. etc.  Negatives: Our waitress. She said she was new, so maybe the blame should ultimately be placed on the management for lack of adequate training. First off, we had a table of 7 and she said for tables of 8 or more they don't do separate checks. So when we repeated that we only had 7 at our table, she still gave us attitude about having to split checks. I know it's a pain in the butt but no one in our party had cash.... Then she forgot a few of our drinks. They were brought promptly but when you forget a few, and also forget the waters we ordered and never come back to check on us again until you bring our food out, we may have a problem. So 2 people we were with went about 20 minutes without drinks while the rest of us were sipping our beer and wine (and missing our waters.) When we went to order our food, a guy we were with asked what came on his sandwich and she replied \"well you can read can't you?\" Um. Ok. Then our food came out. We ate it, liked it, and then sat there for about a half hour after we had all finished eating. We were upstairs and there was almost nobody else up there so I'm not sure why it took so long for her to come back and pick up our plates (or ask us if we wanted more drinks?) She finally came back and we asked for the checks, she brought them and we paid. And then sat there again for about a half hour. At this point we were all super frustrated. It took a bartender to realize how long we'd been sitting there and he finally came and took care of our checks. UGH.  All in all, I love there food and that they cater so well to us gluten free folk. But I probably won't be back to this location for a while."}
{"text":"I've been to the Great Dane multiple times, and have to say it's one of the more diverse menus for a restaurant Madison. If I have a group from out of town that has different dietary needs I will take them here as I know they'll be something on the menu for each person . That said, I am not overly impressed with any one item on the menu. They do offer several self brewed beers.  These are nice, and I would suggest anyone looking for a local Madison Beer stop here."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch today and probably the best I can give this place is an ok ... I am a middle of the road wheat to lighter beer girl minus the hoppy flavor. I was very disappointed when they only had one beer I could stand. Had the french dip sandwich and fries... It was way better than the beer ever thought about being."}
{"text":"I was so surprised at the level of food quality.  The clam chowder rivaled the chowder I had on the wharf in Seattle, WA.  Cheese curds were great.  Fish and chips, great.  It was all good."}
{"text":"I frequent this Great Dane location often because it's closest to my house.  The things I like: 1) Outdoor seating when it's warm 2) Everything I've had on their menu is decent. I like their burgers, the chicken pot pie, and the soup/sandwich combo is awesome. It's good old fashioned Midwest comfort food. 3) Awesome beer - scotch ale is my favorite.  Environment: Casual, usually relatively crowded, but it's a big space so you don't feel cramped. Service: It's never bad, but I'm never walk away with an amazing experience either."}
{"text":"Service was quick and very friendly. Pork tacos were incredible and the unique beer exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Great Dane was a solid 4 stars for the food and an average 3 stars for the beer.  (Especially compared to other breweries and brewpubs in the area).  I will say...they do get some bonus points for being HUGE and having a ton of seating options (P.S. If you are debating sitting outside, know that the outdoor patio is what my partner lovingly dubbed \"the stifling courtyard\" and it was only around 80 degrees that day), for having an awesome menu (everything from delicious pub food to exotic Asian, African, and Indian dishes), and having some seriously fantastic Wisconsin favorites (food made with local beer, cheese curds, and sausage products, duh.).  I ended up getting the Madtown Mountie burger (topped with french fries, garlic dill cheese curds, gravy, and a fried egg) which even overcooked (no one REALLY gives you medium when you ask for it.  Bah.) was freaking divine.  My man got the Texarkana burger and seemed pretty pleased too, but was obviously jealous of my superior choice of basically eating poutine on a burger.  The best of both worlds.  The beer, on the other hand, was just OK.  The server actually chose my sampler based on my extreme indecisiveness and the fact that I pretty much only drink hoppy APAs and IPAs or strong porters and stouts.  I ended up trying all of the above plus a Belgian Pale Ale and a Belgian IPA.  Meh.  None of the beers made me want to take them home (thus adding to my growing collection of growlers I keep forgetting to bring with me on beer trips) which was kind of sad.  Everything seemed safe...not a lot of flavor or aroma in anything, really.  I would totally come back here for the food and one of their lighter beer options, but I'd skip the heavy brews if I were you."}
{"text":"It's a very large bar with some pretty good beer. Friendly service and a cool hangout."}
{"text":"A Madison institution! Great food, good prices, great atmosphere! Has a downstairs with booths, and a bar, and an upstairs with pool tables, shuffleboards, another bar, and some tables have your own private tap, how cool!"}
{"text":"The Great Dane has some excellent beers.  They have several of there own brews.  My favorites are their seasonal winter beers.  The food and device can be a bit hit or miss.  I'm generally satisfied by the food, sometimes it is amazing.  Overall the food is generally well season.  Sometimes a bit salty and sometimes not very fresh tasting.  I think my biggest complaints have been items over cooked, under cooked or having sat under a heat lamp too long.   So, basically it is pretty good even when it isn't at it's best.  One of my other favorite things is that the wait times are too long for a table."}
{"text":"Love it!! My food was fantastic!!! My beet salad was the best ever!! Atmosphere was fun and full of energy."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, great atmosphere. I have not been disappointed by the Great Dane in the five or so times I've been there. Always a go-to restaurant for when I want a good meal."}
{"text":"NOT HAPPY: I used to LOVE this place, but i am a principled type of person.  I love the garden/balcony and there is no other place i know of in Madison that has this.   Food:  My Curry bowl was the BEST i have ever had anywhere.  Seriously loved it...Hat off to the cook.  Wait Staff:  Kevin-he made me laugh many times, was very nice, and timely.  I would not complain about him because he must not be given the power to adjust things on the bill when it doesn't seem right.  I have worked for many companies including the food/beverages industry and was always told,  \"the customer is always right\" or at least \"you give them the extra pickle\". The caveat to this was, i didn't want the pickle.  I wanted to be right....for futures sake, and taking $2 off my $88 bills was actually insulting.  I will tell you why.  Manager KIM:  Since Kevin was not able to handle the bill, Kim came to the table and asked how she could help.  I explained to her that i didn't understand the bill.  She said, \"it's right.\"  I didn't ask her if the bill was right, i asked her to explain it to me.  Ok, so first thought (maybe she didn't know what i meant or maybe......yeah).  I explain to her my story about traveling the world, ordering margaritas wherever i go, and NEVER paying $16.50 for a 3 shot margarita unless you call it and know you are going to pay more, but then with that kind of Tequila you usually just shoot it. After she was done rolling her eyes at me like she wanted to shove me off the balcony she said, i took a couple of dollars off your bill.  I replied, \"I don't need or want any money off my bill, i need you to hear me.  She rolled her eyes and tried to explain alcohol and the prices of consumption in the Madison Area.  Well, first of all, i grew up in \"Madison Area\" so you can step off, second, Like i said before, i traveled around the world.  In Vegas my margarita was 12/drink (same drink but way better). In Boscobel, WI $10 (amazing margarita too, who would've known). Where's Boscobel??? Lol   I just about lost it on her when I realized, she is not where i am at, she is not a good manager, and she has not been trained properly in customer service and maybe she had no power to do anything either, so she decided not to listen and basically insult me.  I understand being in a college town....who knows where people come from, but people please.  I wanted two things at that point......i wanted her to HEAR me (without insulting my intelligence or patronizing) because she has no idea what my level of understanding is...Zero knowledge on her part.  TWO, at that point I wanted all my drinks for free because i was pissed at her lack of leadership and understanding.  I did not get either of what i wanted.  I left there paying the large bill of $88.  Now, this was for two people, but i added up what my drinks cost were, $16.50 for one 20 oz (beer glass). You can buy a whole 750mL for $19.99.  Backstory:  my friends give me crap all the time because i always order a margarita where ever i go and that includes high class, low class, out of state margaritas, multiple states.  I recently had a triple shot Margarita at the Frog Pond near Arlington, WI.  That was awesome and $6.  Why, because she charged at $2/shot.  I have been places where they charge $10 for a margarita (already has two shots) and they up charge for the extra shot $3.50/shot.  So, that would be the highest I have paid $13.50  for a 3 shot margarita.  Another example.  Thursday night i went to Aranda's in Deforest and had a 3 shot Margarita with Jose $10.50 total.  So to break this down more.  What she was telling me.....the GREAT DANE must over charge for tequila shots because??? Crickets......???? Waiting for it???? Nah   Hope the GD does something about it!!"}
{"text":"A group of my friends and I stopped in for Sunday Brunch and it was fantastic! We sat outside on the patio, and had a great time laughing, eating, drinking, and soaking up the sun. I do somewhat wish that they had a little more area that was uncovered for the people who want more vitamin D.  I loved the large variety offered at the buffet, especially the carving and omelette station -- the quality of the food for all you can eat was worth the $18. They offered everything sweet and savory and we couldn't get enough of the cheesy potatoes. I paired my brunch with a bloody mary, which was a bit of a let down honestly. The other people in the group enjoyed mimosas and a refreshing tequila grapefruit drink, which made me fiercely regret my decision even more.  In general, I'm a big fan of The Great Dane, brunch, lunch, and dinner."}
{"text":"I came here while in town for work and this seemed to be a place I would love, but not really business friendly.  So when I found myself staying a day earlier and on my own, I came down.  As it would turn out, a friend was also in town and ended up here.  The bar was my type of place, laid back, great food, good beer, solid service, and a nice atmosphere.  I had the cheese curds bc when in Rome, and a burger with a brat and on a pretzel roll??? YUM.  All their local beers were nice and there was SO much room to spread out.  I am so glad I got to come."}
{"text":"Fish tacos were very good. Cheese curds were alright but other places in town have better. Pretty good beer selection with great taste but a little weak/watered down for my liking."}
{"text":"So good all around!  Beer: I ordered 7 out of the 16 brews they had on tap for a flight. Based on my order, they pulled out the BIG flight container. All were delicious. I even went back and ordered a pint of their stout.   Food: Yummers! Only thing I wish I'd ordered was the cheese curds. Looks like I'm going to have to come back. Because life isn't worth living without cheese curds.   Waitstaff: Nicest/friendliest staff ever. I came up alone, so was obviously eating alone. They happily sat me in a booth. And the waitress, Chloe, was super nice. She was attentive. Let me hang out and do my thing...eat, drink, and listen to book on tape.   Highly recommend this joint! Plus so many brews!"}
{"text":"This place is legit.  It was open on a Sunday night when Madison was closed across the street.  Come here instead!  There are sweet leather couches to sit on, a long bar, pool tables and i believe there are regular tables as well.  There are big screen TVs to watch games on.  The music and sound system are solid.  Played mostly hits from the nineties.  Real nice.  The atmosphere is laid back cool.  The service is attentive and not pushy.    I order their Oktoberfest beer.  It was good.  I also ordered fries and they were hot and crispy and delicious.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDATIONS."}
{"text":"The special was chicken and steak fajita's.The chicken was so dry you needed the wonderful beer to swallow it. The rice was bland and the black beans were straight from the can... No sizzling hot steak on a metal plate here... Pub burger came as ordered medium rare... But the bun was crumbly, reminded me of freezer burn. Why not a good roll toasted??? Asked for my onions to be fried,,, they were not freshly fried all I can say.... Hands down worst bun in my life ever....Loved the view from the east side looking at the Capital, the beer excellent, but still can not make up for the food"}
{"text":"Downtown Location has the absolute best secret Patio!   I could stay all day surrounded by the green ivy walls, 2 stories high that make you feel like you are in a hidden jungle.    Tip: Just tried the tri-pepper beer, which I would give a thumbs up.  Light and spicy aftertaste, but not for everyone."}
{"text":"My family and I came here last week for dinner. We were pleased that we didn't  have to wait for a table and were seated right away.  The service was terrible. We waited a quite a while before we were greeted. She took our drink orders and we ordered an appetizer right away (Nachos, which are my fav here!) It took about 20 minutes before our drinks came.  We got the appetizer..since when did they start putting black beans on the Nachos!?  ugh, they were kind of gross. The black beans were mushy (from the bottom of the can?) and there were a LOT all over them - disappointment. I ordered their steak, which was cooked perfectly. The mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus were yummy too.  I have been to other Great Dane locations and have really enjoyed the food. If this would have been my first time dining - I probably would not have been interested in going back."}
{"text":"Always fun to come by! I haven't been to dinner here for a while but came for some late night hanging out.  My buddies and I like to come here when we're just looking to have some beers and pool. They had a renovation over the summer, it doesn't look that different but it definitely feels newer.  If it's crowded, which I can be during prime hours at night, you just leave your name/ID with them and when you're up, they ring a bell. For less than $10 an hour, it's def worth it!  Clean and fun place to hang out! The wheat beer is awesome."}
{"text":"My visit here was delicious and great. The servers know their beer selection well, and have great recommendations to help you with your decision making. They are patient with picky eaters like myself & quick on getting in orders. Thomas had the Great Dane Pub Burger- which he pretty much inhaled. I had the Veggie P-L-T. I even requested some cooked caramelized onions on the side to put on my sandwich, which was a great idea on my part.  Everything came out quickly even on a busy game night. Though it was a little loud, which is to be expected during a packer game, it was a great spot for dinner and I recommend it to anyone looking for some great brew and food."}
{"text":"Since I'd moved away, I hadn't been to the Great Dane in yeeears. Until last weekend.  On the busy Saturday of Art Fair on the Square weekend, I stopped in with my godmother, my sister and her sleeping baby-in-a-stroller. The hostess was really great and found a table where we could wheel the aforementioned sleeping baby next to without having to wake her up. And when she did later wake up? A high chair was brought over pronto by our fab waitress.   The food was delicious. My godmother maintains that the mussels were among the best ever, my sister enjoyed her burger, and I couldn't even finish the mound o' jerk pork I had. Yum!  Superbly attentive service and everything was fast and fresh - particularly notable as the place was packed.   I remember why I used to like going there. And will take up the habit again now that I'm back in WI!"}
{"text":"I was recommended this place by friends  whom lived in Fitchburg, WI and it was relatively nearby. I was staying in the Sheraton Madison that was off the Hwy 12-14 aka the Beltway, so it was quick and easy to get into Fitchburg without much of anything major at all.  My friend's husband says that it's really popular and I just gotta try it, so off we went.  Located in the Hatchery Hill shopping plaza on Fish Hatchery Road in Fitchburg, the Great Dane Pub is very much like a Buffalo Wild Wings type of restaurant. Loud and plenty of televisions for the masses who come here for good food and liquor. We were seated quickly and that was good. We got a booth and quickly ordered. I guess my hosts knew what they wanted. It was my first time I have tried cheese curds from Wisconsin, but it tasted like hot cheese sticks you may have seen from Pizza Hut, just made into balls and from Wisconsin cheese. I was not impressed, but it was good.  I ordered the $17 Argentinian steak that night, which came with a cheese soup thingy and a scoop of mashed potatoes. I ordered the steak medium, but it looked like the steak was grilled and somewhat dry, but still moist. Guess this is not a real steakhouse, so I just wanted real meat. The steak turned out ok, could be better. The garlic mash hit the spot and the cheesy soup thing was pretty good too. Not sure if that meal costed $17, but it certainly did. I opted out of any alcohol with my meal, since we ended up going to Michael's Frozen Yogurt for dessert, which was cool and desired.   The overall service was decent and good, so that was promising. The ambiance was loud and forgettable. I had a good time with my Wisconsin Fitchburg friends that night, so my overall experience was good. The prices was on par with the restaurants/bars I have been to, most notably Chili's and Buffalo Wild Wings. They take major credit cards and cash, so that's a plus.  Tip generously if the server was great. I know I did.  Support local!  B"}
{"text":"Gr time last night at the pub. Crowded but great drinks and food. Home made root beer was a definite plus."}
{"text":"Open late, a lot of options for everyone, elevated bar food, great BEER, win-win situation.  Please introduce desserts, a wider range then I won't have to go elsewhere to satisfy my sweet tooth."}
{"text":"The Great Dane isn't a terrible place to go for dinner, but the reason you should really be there is for the drinks. They're housed in a massive, beautiful building on Capitol Square. It genuinely has that unique Wisconsin supper club feel, and they've achieved local infamy for it. But the food is somewhat average; while The Dane certainly doesn't have the worst cheese curds I've ever had, they're not at all memorable. I would describe all the food I had as good, but just that. Good, not amazing.  Most of the beer on the menu is brewed in-house, and isn't available anywhere else. There are some misses, but they do feature some excellent beer as well as a decent but limited selection of local brands. Drinks can be dirt-cheap, and given the ambiance, I could drink here all day. This is definitely one place you'll want to show to your friends from out of town."}
{"text":"Long overdue...but here it is folks. Great beer all brewed in house. Great burgers, you can't go wrong with the original Dane burger (my favorite) and some beer bread with honey butter, YUM! Great atmosphere, pool tables, darts, shuffleboards upstairs and dining area downstairs. Their Sunday brunch is one of the best in the area.   On my last visit, I went with the fish fry which I was not impressed with. You can find better in the area. I also tried a new item on the menu, poutine which my French Canadian friends are also raving about. The poutine was delicious!  Overall, a great place for a casual dining experience with great beer and burgers."}
{"text":"This is a great go-to everytime I'm in Madison. Great brews and solid food.  This time we got the case of wings with all 4 sauces which were delicious.  African soup also good Cajun chicken sammy yum  They have a great outdoor seating area which is great during the Summer as well."}
{"text":"Really good food. The Walleye Sandwich and Salad w. door county cherries are special favourites.  But and it's a big but for me, they tend to be really packed and loud."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now and it will be our go to place every time we visit Madison. Excellent menu choices and fresh made food. The court yard area is a very nice place to have Sunday brunch. They have a gluten free menu for those that have to abstain from wheat protein. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Brought my husband for his birthday dinner while in town.  The space is huge with indoor and outdoor sitting. Plenty of space for large groups. The food menu had a little bit of everything for everyone to pick from. They have good beer selection."}
{"text":"Good... not mind blowing. Beer was probably the best part of it, and it's cool you could get it at Mallards games.  Not overwhelmingly amazing, though. I once won a $40 gift certificate and forgot to redeem it. Was not disappointed. Might be a sign."}
{"text":"After my first trip to \"The Dane\" I came away pretty impressed. I went there for a friend's birthday and we got to sit in the beer garden. It was a nice escape from the usual Madison outdoor eating experience.   Despite the fly population, I thought the food was top notch.   I got the Smothered and Covered Fried Chicken. Let's just say the description fit the bill. That chicken was smothered and covered in delicious gluttony.  I'm a creature of habit, so it will be tough for me to get something else the next time I go, but I hear the burgers are the bees-knees as well."}
{"text":"This place is probably my favorite pub to go to in Madison.  Let's start with the beer, because no one goes to pubs for their Shirley temples. The Great Dane has a wide selection of both local and imported beer. Now I'm by no means a beer connoisseur, but I actually enjoy their beer. Considering how I use beer as an avenue to get drunk, and not a source of enjoyment, I'd say their beer is pretty damn good. I'd highly recommend their Peck's Pilsner, as it actually tastes like something I had in Prague.  Now on to their food... My god their food is absolutely delicious. It's like paradise in my mouth. Their cheese curds are fried perfectly, and is a must have if you're not from the area. Their Baja burger can feed a man for a week, with its giant, juicy and delightfully spicy beef. I've also had their mango mahi mahi, which is just as good.   Finally, if you have a friend that's been annoying you recently, you should tell them to get the hellfire wings. Then just kick back and enjoy the show, as their mouth burns off. My point? Don't order the hellfire wings unless you really want to know what it feels like to set your inner organs on fire."}
{"text":"I've had a bad experience with this place and no new experiences that really put it above the bar. Everytime I go I get disappointed. I've been to both the Fitchburg  and the downtown Madison locations and pretty much had the same or worse experience. One time me and a group of people came in a little late in the night for food the waitress had a severe attitude problem right off the bat would not split the check forced us to have a 30% tip which I understand since it was kind of late and we were large group. What really made it bad though is the fact of waitress kept sighing, rolling her eyes making exasperated gasps at everything we would say ask or do. The manager came out at one point checked on how everything was we complained, some of our food was cold since it wasn't cooked to order and on top of that the manager seemef to smile sarcastically. So aside from that bad experience which set the bar for this entire place, the other experience I had was extremely mediocre. When I went with a friend who I hadn't seen a long time just to get a pitcher of beer asking any question about what beers they had or if they had a certain beer visibly pissed off the lady behind the counter or frustrated her. Seems they only hire women with good looks for their waitstaff and ignore anything about customer service personality or general manners. Do yourself a favor go to one of the actual local places around Madison support them, their friendly staff, their less questionable hiring practices and avoid the generic trap that is all Great Danes in Madison."}
{"text":"A group of 10 of us visited the Great Dane Brew Pub for a late lunch Saturday. What a great experience! Lucky for us, they were able to accommodate our group even though we had no reservations. (There are a lot of tables at the Great Dane.) Our waitress was friendly, knowledgeable, and patient (we had 3 children and a baby.)  There is an extensive selection of beverages available. The Emerald Island Stout was particularly smooth and creamy. The menu consists of a wide variety of pub foods such as burgers, sandwiches, salads, and appetizers with a lot of special twists thrown in. For example, I had the brat & pretzel bacon burger which had both a brat burger, a beef burger, bacon, cheese, and was served on a pretzel bun. This may have been one of the best burgers I have ever eaten! It was seriously that good. The home-made chips are also great. Crunchy, thick, salty, not particularly greasy. A very good chip. There are also some less traditional dishes such as the chicken-pot pie, mac & cheese adn peanut stew. Everrthing we tried was tasty and well-prepared.  I am definitely a convert to the Great Dane Brew Pub. I plan to go back often!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, amazing beer, and a perfect place to start a night or grab a post-farmers' market/pregame/afterwork meal in Madison.  My ideal Dane dinner features the chicken nachos, big ten burrito, and an APA on the side."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here after having noshed at the Taste of Madison earlier in the day. Being that we showed up around 7PM on a Saturday night, we figured that we would have to wait a while before getting a table and were prepared to do so. We were seated right away and had beer in our hands shortly afterward.   ATMOSPHERE: While the basement and back of the restaurant are a maze, the lighting, layout and circulation through the dining area were done well. While filled with alot of people, it didn't seem at all crowded. Being a Chicago White Sox fan it was also nice to see good baseball being played on television much to the delight of the local fans.   DRINKS: ROUND 1: Devils Lake Red Lager for me and Black Earth Porter for my wife. I enjoyed the Red Lager but it seemed a slightly subdued version of a standard red rye ale. As a self-proclaimed beer connoisseur I had to sample some of my wife's selection. The Black Earth Porter was very bold and full flavored and proved to be my refuge when my Round 2 choice was not available.   FOOD: We both enjoyed our brews while splitting an order of Nakoma Nachos. The nachos were standard pub style and were good but nothing out of the ordinary. We were not expecting much but our entrees would blow us away. My wife had the Tandoori Chicken, which she thoroughly enjoyed and I had the Inner Warmth Peanut Stew. As a vegetarian I am often stuck with minimal options as far as entrees go; this was not the case at Great Dane. I spent a while wrestling with what I actually wanted for dinner given that I had many options to choose from. The stew was almost too good, as each spoonful found me focusing on some different aspect of it's flavor. I can say with certainty that I have never had a hearty veggie stew that I didn't make myself, until that night. I left nothing on my plate and felt comfortably full from this dish.   DRINKS: ROUND 2: Black Earth Porter for me and Crop Circle Wheat for my wife. My only gripe comes at this point. I had asked for The Stone of Scone Scotch Ale, which was unavailable. That it was unavailable was not a problem, but the fact that it was not mentioned or noted anywhere was. That aside, we were both happy with our drink choices.   SERVICE: Our server was swamped yet still managed to stay on top of our every need, which seemed an impossible feat. She was well-versed in the menu and had a very pleasant demeanor despite her hectic pace.   PRICE: The price tag for 2 rounds of drinks, 2 entrees, and an appetizer was far less than we would have thought. Maybe we are used to the inflated prices of the Chicago metro area but all of that for under $50 almost sent us into shock. Good food paired with good beer and above average service is worth quite a bit more than that."}
{"text":"Love the Great Dane, but prefer the one downtown, normally.  We've had some meals here that just aren't as good as the one downtown.   That said, they've redeemed themselves.  We went recently for the fish and it was excellent!!  Got the pan fried walleye--so good.  And the kids meals are decent, too.  Love that you can get fruit or veggies for .50!    The parking lot and garage were full so I expected a long wait, but we were seated right away."}
{"text":"I've been hitting up the GDP for years. Always great beer and pretty solid food. The calamari is awesome! The Nakoma nachos and the beer bread are other favorites. For the entree, burgers are the way to go. I've found that when I try to get a more unique dish, like the tandoori chicken or drunken jerk, I end up disappointed. They used to have a beer can chicken, which was super good... I really wish they would bring that back!"}
{"text":"I love me a turkey burger and this was a good one. I recommend getting it with the pretzel bun. Good food, good beer, great times in the bar after dinner."}
{"text":"Things I love in life: beautiful outdoor seating, good food and delicious beer. The Great Dane has all this in spades. We tried a bunch of cocktails and food. Things we loved: mixed berry mojito, passion fruit beer, Bloody Mary, Texas roadkill (or something) beer. Food wise, the Pretzel and Brat burger was to die for. Delicious homemade pretzel bun, a Wisconsin brat, caramelized onions and a delicious patty served with their homemade Pilsner mustard. I mean, WOW. I also tried their Mediterranean chicken sandwich which was decent but nothing great.   The service is excellent, the location can't be beat and the food is so, so good. This location is full of history - highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I like The Great Dane a lot, we've been to several of the locations around Madison. They have great beers and always good service. We usually go to the one on Jupiter Dr. and no complaints. We stopped into this location in Fitchburg after running errands to have some drinks and appetizers. We were told they had tables upstairs with beer tappers on the tables. We loved that idea so we sat at one of those. We were immediately told that one of the 4 beers currently offered at the tap tables wasn't working, so that was disappointing but not a huge deal because it wasn't one of the main ones we were wanting to drink. The waitress came over and told us she didn't know how to use the tapper at the table and we were given plastic pitchers to run the lines. After several pitchers of foam, we finally started getting one of the three beers to come out nice. The other two \"working\" ones remained foamy. So we drank the one that appeared to be working. We continued running the lines into pitchers but it wasn't much use. The table keeps track of how much liquid comes out to decide how you pay, and therefore shouldn't count foam but it began to count the foam the longer we tried. We also ordered mixed drinks which were great. We got cheese curds and poutine fries with fried chicken. They were both good, but the curd breading was too floury for my taste. Like I said, this chain is usually awesome but the beer tap table was disappointing so I took off a star. The staff was awesome and didn't make us pay for any of the beer we kept running through the line to see if the foam dissipated. So overall great place, just don't sit at the tap tables."}
{"text":"Beer is okay. Food is absolutely phenomenal! Green curry mussels, fried cheese curds, & fish tacos. Their brandy old fashioned was also delicious. A great place to grab food/drinks and watch the game."}
{"text":"The Great Dane has a fantastic atmosphere, an incredible set pool tables, and some pleasantly decent food; that being said, their beer is just plain bad. In fact, it's probably -4 stars bad, detracting from the 5 star everything else. The $6.00 minimum price tag aside, I've had something like 8 of their 15 \"signature\" beers and I'm borderline scared to try the remaining 7. Just bad. Come here for food and friends, but save yourself the money and hydrate yourself with water to last longer for the 10 better beer establishments near the square."}
{"text":"The Dane is one of my local hangouts. Where I go for a good meal when I have nowhere new to go. I almost always get a burger (they cook it to the actual mediumness that you want!).   Their beer is good, although with many microbrews, it is a little grainy. Love the crop circle wheat though.   Their fries are a little lacking. They over pepper/salt/spice them always and they typically aren't done too well. (I like'em crispy.)   Wait staff is pleasant, but the actual wait that it took to get a table is typically longer than i normally would wait.   My only real complaint (and the reason I gave it 4 stars) is that smoking is allowed there."}
{"text":"For pub food, this place is excellent, with a very impressive and extensive menu. If I were ranking just pub style restaurants, the Dane would get 4 stars but it is hard to do that with the likes of True and L'Etoile around. Many of the choices are very unique as well to the typical bar and reasonably priced. The beer, of course, is delish with a standard range from the German Pils to its Stout.  They also have cask seasonals which are very tasty. I have been patronizing the Dane for years and will continue to do so. A bonus is the wait staff and bartenders are generally beautiful."}
{"text":"the beer is definitely the saving grace here. we tried a good chunk of the beers on the menu including the crop circle wheat, one of the porters, the landmark lite and a seasonal gingerbready ale called merry isthmus (clever, eh?). i thought all of the beers were great; i even liked the cask conditioned ale despite my affinity for ice cold beer. i'm pretty sure all the beers were in 'higher octane' category because all 3 of us seemed to leave fairly tipsy.  the place is huge, and though i didn't explore every room, i am fairly certain this is someplace i do NOT want to be when school is in session. it was already a little louder than i might have liked."}
{"text":"I've mistakenly walked into the Great Dane downtown Madison once before, I've eaten at the Great Dane on Midvale, and now I've enjoyed their brew at their location in Fitchburg. I still need to stop in to the one on the Eastside (and technically the one in Wausau - but let's be honest, I'm not driving 2 hours to see it) before I can say with all of my confidence that the Fitchburg location is the best one.  Sure, now that I've had a great experience here, I need to give the other locations just as much attention to make a clear decision. But as it stands, this is a great bar. Dining downstairs and fun upstairs. Not saying you can't (or shouldn't) enjoy a good time downstairs, but the shuffleboard is located upstairs for a reason! Plus two pool tables and plenty of comfy booths surrounding the activity. This place is a keeper and I can't wait to come back with a large group and self-serve with the tappers at the booths. That just sounds like a big kid party to me! I have never seen tappers outside of the bar before, and I wonder why there aren't more establishments doing it?!  I am a sucker for a good, flavorful dark beer these days (my taste-buds have gotten more sophisticated, what can I say). I had a few of their Oatmeal Stouts, and I enjoyed it, though it had a little bit of that unwanted 'burnt' flavor that so many complain about. It wasn't overpowering, but it existed - and without an alternative, I was stuck. Oh well.  I'm not a smoker, but I thought it was important to note that they do have a patio section available year round for those that indulge to go out and get their nicotine on. The patio area looks like it would be a lot of fun come summer time, I shall return when the snow is gone and the locals are wearing shorts again! Though, I expect to return much sooner as well!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been there in the last three years and had a VERY BAD experience.  We went two years ago because it was a great meeting spot after the Great Taste of the Midwest.  The waitstaff and bouncers were incredibly rude, though, and the manager was not to be found/bothered.  It was so bad, we avoided it last year while in town for the festival.   This year we went back, hoping that things had changed.  While the company has apparently gotten bigger, they are no better.  After keeping us waiting for more than an hour, they had trouble accommodating a party of seven (with two children), even though there was more than enough room at the tables.  The hostess for the biergarten (who was not more than 22 and certainly was embarrassing to her UW education if she was attending there) was very condescending and unhelpful.  She offered to  get her manager, but he or she never bothered to come by.  Then, the waitress, who did not come to our table for 15 minutes after we had been sitting there, refused to get us a round of beers, proclaiming in the most condescending manner,  \"I think you need a round of waters first.\"  Notwithstanding that this 22-year old was probably an expert in binge drinking, we were not out of control. Or, to the extent that we were, it was only because we were famished and irate from having to wait so long for food and service.  So, we left, leaving me unable to satisfy my anger at being so disrespected by leaving a few pennies for a tip.  Let me explain something to you, Great Dane:  your beer is not that great.  I put it at a three out of ten.  I cannot remember anybody ever being excited about your food.  And, as has now been demonstrated twice, your service is awful.  What you do have is an excellent location for the beer festival.  But that is all.  We ended up having a great rest of our night, free of incidents, at your competitor, the Old Fashioned.  Unless you like being disrespected. I highly recommend nobody be tricked by this bar's location and go back to this place.  I certainly will never go back."}
{"text":"Love the Great Dane. Celebrated many fun occasions there. I'm not a huge fan of the local brews they offer, but the atmosphere and great food are so worth it. A Madison must."}
{"text":"I was originally going to give this place a 4, but the more I thought about it, I think a 3 is more appropriate. First off, I was not impressed with the beer. They all had a fairly watered down taste and were lacking a full flavor profile.  The food was good, but not much better than I could get at another non chain restaurant. My burger was good, not great. I got the one with the cream cheese and I was expecting a nice shmear on there. But it was really more of a light spread. All in all, not a bad place, but not great either.  And yes, the courtyard was stifling."}
{"text":"This was the first place I ate at in Madison and it was so great I went back the follow day. They have an eclectic menu to say the least and the first meal I had there was the Black & Tan burger with melted cheese sauce which melted in my mouth. A big plus about this place is they have sweet potato tater tots which are amazing and more healthy than regular tater tots/fries. The following day I had the New Mexico soup which had green chili in it which I thought was so random but it was very good. I had the Cajun chicken sandwich the following day which was amazing as well. The service was fast and very friendly. I asked one of the waiters directions that did not have the answer to but I literally watched him ask 2 other people to get the information he did and go out of his way. Great Dane's prices I felt the strength of their food was extremely reasonable and not overpriced at all. I would very much go back here if I visited Madison again, actually it would be the first step I make."}
{"text":"Great place! Came here twice in two days- once for happy hour, once for a wedding reception.  All my beer drinking companions had great things to say about their beer (especially the polar vortex) and I loved the appetizers. The boneless chicken wings are gigantic chunks of chicken and the sweet sauce was very flavorful. Being in Wisconsin, it's only fair to judge a place based on its cheese curds, and the Great Dane delivers on those as well.  At the wedding reception the brewhouse steak was good. I was skeptical about the chimichurri sauce, but it was a perfect partner to the steak. I also may have sampled some mixed drinks at this time, and their bartenders were all top notch. I have nothing but good things to say about this place. Very well worth your time if you're in Madtown."}
{"text":"Everytime I come to Madison for work, The Great Dane is the place to be when it comes to post-meeting hangout and food. I came here several times over the course of 10 days! I think I came here at least 4 times. The outdoor biergarten is pretty great on summer days.  A few notes:  - two words: HONEY BUTTER. try it on their beer bread... it is very good. - the portions for lunch are very large! and very fried! mmm.... - the cheese curds here are a-ok. Word on the street is that the old fashioned's is much better. - they have tiny sampler sizes for the beer -- perfect for me since I have an allergy. I really like their dark brews. - service here is pretty attentive and very accommodating to large groups - large appetizers for groups - yummy pile of nachos   I'm currently wearing my dad's vintage Bucky the Badger shirt that says \"it's hard to be humble when you're from wisconsin.\" go big red!"}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant at which I've eaten in Madison, and it was a great way to start! I went with two friends who live here because it's their favorite restaurant downtown, and wasn't disappointed. We started with the cheese curds appetizer, which was tasty and awesome, and then I had a burger that was cooked perfectly and full of flavor.  I'm sure I'll be eating here again."}
{"text":"We  visited the Great Dane on a Sunday approximately at 1 PM.  We were greeted by a hostess who told us that we were not allowed to order off of the main menu, and that we could only order off of the late night menu on account of the fact that they have a Sunday Buffet (she didn't bother to try to sell the buffet).  The place looks great and the Great Dane seems to have some cachet in the greater Madison area.  We were seated and promptly served by a capable waitress, Michelle.  She took my beer order, and promptly returned with the beer in a dirty glass.  She was cheerful about replacing it.  She then took our order, which consisted mostly of pub burgers and deep fried cheese.  The fried cheese was fairly obviously some frozen product, and was mediocre at best for about 8 DOLLARS!  The pub burgers came shortly thereafter.  It was pointless of Michelle to ask how we wanted our burgers, because they all arrived well done (I wanted mine medium rare).  The fries were good, but not great.  The beer (German Pils), although made on site, was stale and flat.    The place is nice, clean, and the waitress was good.  Unfortunately for the waitress, she was the only server in the entire section and was quite frazzled.  Further, we had to climb a huge flight of stairs to get to the door - which wouldn't be bad in the summer, but the stairs were not shoveled and VERY dangerous.  DON\"T TAKE ELDERLY PEOPLE ON THESE STAIRS!  The food seemed to be right out of the Sysco food service catalog, the management was obviously poor, and the beer wasn't good enough to make the trip another time.  Don't bother.  Go somewhere else.  Food was very pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Solid.  Lots of people.  Good beer.  I actually like the wheat, which is weird...  No complaints, would come back anytime."}
{"text":"I probably will not return to this restaurant.. My husband and I came in a couple weeks ago and I was not impressed. He liked the beer choices, but that's about it. The food was mediocre, we ordered the soft pretzel, it took forever to get out to us and it, along with the cheese dip, was cold. I've had better pretzels from a store bought em box honestly. The burgers we got were not that good, again, I've had way better elsewhere. All very bland food! Service wasn't anything special but wasn't bad either, needs better food/cooks! I'm glad the prices weren't higher because I would have complained then. Won't be returning"}
{"text":"The brunch here is really good! 15 dollars gets you lots of choices from biscuits and gravy to omelets to ice cream. Service was good and they removed plates and filled drinks regularly. It would have gotten 5 stars but some of the food was cold on the buffet line. Also, they don't take discover."}
{"text":"Ordered a 4 sampler of dark beer and a soup/half sandwich.  Enjoyed the beer.  I ordered  African chicken soup and the alpine grilled cheese sandwich for lunch.  Both were great!  Sat outside in their patio area.  Restaurant has a great atmosphere.  Only negative was hostess was more concerned about seating us in a location that they wanted us to sit and not a location in the sun where we wanted to sit.  It was a cold day and a bit of sun would have been nice.  Restaurant was not crowded."}
{"text":"I like the Dane because it can accommodate a lot of people, the food is quite good, (especially for late night), the patio is pretty great and there are plenty of pool tables.   That said, the beer's nothing to write home about which is a problem for a brew pub.  Good place to take the folks or out of towners though."}
{"text":"We had a large crowd so the service was pretty slow and they ended up messing up on a couple of the bills but the food here is phenomenal so we'll definitely come back. Andy & i shared the ahi poke and wish we each would've gotten one. It was so delicious we devoured it in no time. The tuna was just slightly seared and the seasonings and marinade were delectable. Never would've imagined a brew pub having such awesome seafood. Their cocktails are also inventive and delicious. For dessert andy had the black & tan brownie which he says is also amazing. Cant wait to go back and try some of their other items that the rest of the group seemed to enjoy."}
{"text":"The Great Dane Pub in downtown Madison was only a short walk from my hotel.  I don't know what it would be like to find parking if I had driven here.  The place is huge.  I didn't realize it at first, but it is like three bars in one.  There is the small pub with bar and some high tables, a large game room pub with another bar and pool tables, and then there is the \"cave\" in the basement with yet another dimly lit bar and booths.  (This would have been more my style, but I didn't discover it until I went looking for the men's room which is also in the basement.)  As usual we camped at the bar and ordered a sampler.  The bartender served us with a smile.  The ten samples were presented on a large wooden dog bone shaped  tray.  The beers were all drinkable, but there were too many lites, pilsners and other \"safe\" versions of beer styles for my taste.  (Unfortunately for the Dane, I had spent several hours earlier in the day at a pub with a much tastier selection.) I didn't settle in for a long session at the Great Dane, but if I was going to, then I might have had a pint of the Crop Circle Wheat, Devils Lake Red Lager  or the Black Earth Porter.   The food that we had was tasty.  The Drunken Jerk wasn't me for a change, but it was what I ate.  The marinade, with a mix of sweet and spice nicely complemented the meat.  It would have been perfect if the meat was more tender.  They really should have taken the time to cook it until it was falling apart.  My wife's Sustain-A-burger was juicy and delicious.  I spent about two hours at the Great Dane on a Thursday evening and it was hopping the whole time.  One thing that I noticed both in this pub and on the street, is that downtown Madison seems to have a high density of attractive young women.  I am a happily married man, but I thought I would add that to my review for all you eligible bachelors out there.  Overall, I enjoyed my visit to the Great Dane Pub in downtown Madison.  The food was tasty, the atmosphere was fun.  The beer was OK, but not great.  If this place was in my neighborhood, I would definitely be a regular.  The beer is the deciding factor for me though.  I wish I could give this place a 3.5, but I cannot justify a 4 until the beer ranks up there with other fine Madison area breweries."}
{"text":"Holy Beer Selection!  I'm still in shock the bartender was willing to play the game 'what do you recommend' even more in shock that he made great selections 3 out of 3 times.  Great array of tvs and lots of games. - just a great all around bar to grab a beer and watch a game."}
{"text":"Very average food.  Their brews are also quite average and unremarkable.  There are better places to eat and drink  in town, but the location is good and you are unlikely to get poisoned or stabbed so..."}
{"text":"This is a great pub in downtown Madison. They brew several of their own beverages, including ginger ale and cream soda. The soda is pretty good; I left with a growler my first time here. They also offer poutine as an appetizer, which I once thought sounded disgusting and would tease my Canadian friends about; I've seen the error of my ways.  Best part about this specific location is the great outdoor garden seating. If you stop in when the garden is open, take advantage."}
{"text":"Dropped by for a late night dinner last Friday.  Not really sure what the bar scene is like here, but I can vouch for a number of things on the menu.    I split an order of chicken tenders and pretzels.  Yes.  This place has pretzels offered as a menu item.  While these were really good, the highlight of the dinner was the macaroni and cheese that was being eaten across the table from me.  When I think of mac and cheese, I have the typical habit of imagining a blue box of processed foodstuff.  This mac and chseese couldn't be further from that stuff.  It's hard to explain if that is what you picture.  But trust me and just try it.  And yes, that wedge of goodness served up on top of the dish IS a hunk of cheese.  MMM...cheese...Wisconsin...cholesterol...car ride back to Minneapolis.    In all fairness to the pretzels, I may be selling them a little short because I am not a huge fan of pretzels in general.  Nevertheless, they were good."}
{"text":"My wife and I joke that I think the only times we eat at the Great Dane is when we have company from out of town.  When we think about a good local place to take our friends and family, this is the first place that comes to mind.    That's for a good reason.  It's probably the best representation of the Madison culture you can find out in the \"suburbs\".  Microbrew, good food, good atmosphere.  You won't leave disappointed.  I still haven't found a menu item I don't like.  My wife loves the Wisconsin Mac & Cheese (do we just call it Mac and Cheese here?).   I'm a fan of the \"Big 10 veggie burrito\" and their buffalo burger, while a little dry because it's so lean, comes with enough of a sauce that it makes up for it.    Ever try their Sunday brunch?  Good heavens.  I was in a food coma for the rest of the day.  Everything is so good, and so filling.  Just remember to get there as soon as they open, or else you'll end up with a long wait for a table.    Oh yes, the beer.  My wife loves the Crop Circle Wheat, which blows the name brands like Blue Moon out of the water.  I'm a fan of the Peck's Pilsner and the Devil's Lake Red Lager..  The Red Lager is on par with what you'd get from a Killians.   The Landmark Lite is just that, light.  Like Miller Lite light.  If that's your thing, that's cool.  But why would you come to a microbrew for a Lite beer?    I've never left disappointed, and neither have our out-of-town friends."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. First, the beer is amazing and never disappoints... the scotch ale and sugar river esb are my faves and the oatmeal stout gets rid of a hangover immediately! The food is sooooo good, especially for how inexpensive it is.  I am a vegetarian and i never run out of options... my faves.. the tomato bisque soup, grilled cheese, portabello quesadilla, veggie burrito (HUGE) and the wisconsin style cheddar mac. This place has a great atmosphere as well.  The downstairs dining room is nice and quiet (usually) with dark wood and roomy booths.  the bar downstairs has a ton of seating with a tv in every corner.  The upstairs has a Wii, pool tables, video games, and shuffle board.  And and Fridays and Saturdays they have popular djs from the Madison area. The Sunday brunch is also fantastic, with a full salad bar, nacho bar, omelet station, fresh fruit, patries, prime rib and anything else you could think of!"}
{"text":"Really good pub food and great craft beer. The location is right by the Capitol and its a historic building. Staff was quick and helpful. I was coming through town on my way home and saw the reviews on Yelp which were really good. I'm glad I stopped."}
{"text":"Fuck. This growler from last week's jaunt is really great. I guess if you get a growler of Crop Circle Wheat and let it sit in your fridge for a week it gains potency."}
{"text":"Great service, awesome beers, and the food was delicious. Highly recommend if you are in the Madison area! Bloody Mary was one of the best I've had in awhile. I had the Spicy Black Bean Burger, and you could tell it was made with fresh ingredients. Super delicious!"}
{"text":"My first trip to Wisconsin, a good friend of mine picked me up from the airport and took me straight here.  She knows what I like!  It's right in the middle of downtown Madison, great spot, the building has alot of character.  As soon as we walked in I was hit full in the face with the overwhelming smell of hops.  I immediately knew I would like it here!  We were sat right away and I went straight for their Octoberfest.  This was just how it should taste.  Well balanced with malt and hops, good clean finish, I had to have 2.  My friend introduced me to fried cheese curds, and the only thing that stopped me from finishing them off was the arrival of my entree.  On our servers suggestion, I went with the brat plate. Mashed potatoes, house-made slaw, no buns, just the most tender, juiciest brats I have ever had!  The slaw had raisens in it, which I religiously avoid, so I couldn't eat too much of it.  I don't hold that against them.  After lunch, I went ahead and tried a scottish ale, this was also great, but the Octoberfest was the better beer.  I ended up buying two growlers, one for my friend and one for my hotel room. :)  The service was fast and friendly, and the place was very warm and inviting.  I don't know when I'll be back in Madison, but when I do, I will be making another trip here!"}
{"text":"I had pretty high hopes coming here but left feeling rather unimpressed. I ordered a burger and fries and was really disappointed with my meal. Even though I ordered medium rare the burger was really dry and the fries were just not very good either.   Aside from my main dish, everything was pretty positive about the experience. We had an order of cheese curds to share. Nice crisp batter on the outside and fresh tasting cheese on the inside. They have a wide selection of in-house brews. We had the Scotch Ale, which was not bad. The staff were really friendly, even offering us generous samples of their brews. Of our samples, I really liked the porter, which I would definitely order if I came back here.  Atmosphere-wise, there is a lot of seating available. The booths are nice for a group of four to have a nice dinner, drink, and conversation. Overall it is a place I really want to like, but I just couldn't get past a subpar main dish."}
{"text":"This place was average. Average beer. Average food. We were absolutely NOT blown away in any way. My husband liked his quesadilla but the \"highly recommended\" fish fry was just ok.   On top of \"meh\" food and drink, in the middle of our meal, our server actually LEFT for the day. She was polite about it but it was honestly the most awkward thing and made us feel like we were in the way - especially since our second server was basically the restaurant equivalent of a babysitter."}
{"text":"im almost sad that i found this place, because now i have a difficult time choosing between this place and the old fashioned when i visit madison...   all of the food that i put into my mouth here was great. i also had a good amount of great beer so i dont fully remember what all the food was that i put into my mouth... just trust that its all good.   i was equally as impressed with the beer though, if not more. they brew all their own beer, at least from what i remember. i am a pretty harsh judge of beer, just ask the horny goat, this place does it right. it was clear that they actually care about the quality of the beer they put out, which is sometimes not the case with gastropub sort of places.  basically id definitely recommend trying this place out. youll be happy you did."}
{"text":"Great Dane in a strip mall.  Place is huge.  Food is acceptable but undifferentiated.  House beer is acceptable.  Outdoor seating available but not much of a view.  Decent place to grab grub if in area but not a destination."}
{"text":"Decent bar food, but nothing to write home about.   Brewpub thing alone was cool 20 years ago when there weren't a lot of folks doing it, but they need to pick up their game on their in house  brews if they want to compete with the other great brewpubs that have opened in Madison."}
{"text":"The Great Dane on the square is my go-to place to take people when we are up near the Capitol - here are the reasons why:  1) When we have visitors, there are almost always kids. LOTS of kids.  Today we had four adults and six kids.  The downtown Dane has a nice basement area with large tables that is perfect for big parties with children because, not only is there room, it's usually less busy so our rowdy kids won't bother nearly as many people.  2) They have a humongous selection of food. If you can't find something you like at The Great Dane, you should probably just stay home. They have everything, including good options for kids and vegetarian meals that are marked with a little carrot to easily identify them.  3) Beer is good for you. Especially beer that is not made by a big beverage company.  My favorite is the Crop Circle Wheat, but I'm a wheat beer girl, so anything with wheat makes me happy.  4) The food is good. It's not the best food you are going to find in Madison, but it's good.  The Mac and Cheese (which I've probably eaten 10 times) can be really hit or miss. Sometimes it's amazing. Sometimes it needs more sauce.  Today I had the grilled cheese, which is really more of a vegetable sandwich with cheese.  This is the second time I've had this, and it was substantially better than the first.  I really don't have anything bad to say about The Great Dane. Our server today seemed a little annoyed at having to serve a giant party of kids 5 and under, but one slightly peeved server does not a bad restaurant make...I think I said that right. ;)    We will keep coming back to the Dane...it's a bit like a Madison institution at this point. ;)"}
{"text":"\"Largely excellent brew pub with a delicious variety of beer and extensive menu, but its venue lacks distinctiveness.\"  Several occasions over the past year, I have strolled over to the Great Dane. The 1st item sought is the beverage. They are gracious enough to provide sampler platters for their beer (four ounce glasses). I am more than nourished with the sixer for $7.50. They offer an eclectic assortment of micro brews, but their standouts are: Stone of Scone Scotch Ale; India Pale Ale; Cask Conditioned Ale; Old Glory American Pale Ale; Emerald Island Stout and Devil's Lake Red Lager. It's extremely fun to drink from light to dark.   The menu is exciting blend of tradition and culinary wizardry. For starters: go for the Nakoma Nachos with beef, Wingra Wings; Bard's Sampler or Jaime's Mahi Tacos. The sandwiches and salads are large and mouth, but the absolute \"must have\" is the Great Dane Brat and Bacon Pretzel Burger! The other dinner that consistently requires indulgence is Brats and Mash plate.   it the perfect setting for a large gathering, but the venue has overwhelming aire of industrial and impersonal, so it loses its appeal (for the 1st few beers) with smaller / more cozy crowds."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Great Dane locations.  I have been here a number of times.  The service and food is consistently some of the best in Madison.  They also have some of the best cheese curds in the state.  The beer here isn't my favorite, but they usually have at least one or two good beers on tap.  The bartenders are pretty good too, so mixed drinks are always an option when the beer selection isn't at its best."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  It was busy, but not crazy busy.  We got seated right away in the beer garden....which was beautiful.  They restaurant as a whole has a nice vibe, and the bathrooms are super clean....which is a big deal for me!    They have a lot of different food and beer to choose from.  I'll definitely have to come back, because there is a lot I want to try.    I'll start with the beer.  They have a nice variety of house brewed beer.  I had the crop circle wheat...wheat beers are my fave, and this was a good one!  They have a very extensive menu with all sorts of food.  They have typical bar food, Mexican, pasta, Indian...needless to say, they have a lot to choose from.   I really like bar food, so I went with the burger.  They also had quite a few sides to choose from...I got the sweet potato tots.  They don't give you anything to dip them in though.  My friend got the quesadilla which came with a great chipotle bbq sauce.  Next time, I'm going for the brat and bacon burger.  Oh yes...you read that right.  That's a lot of meat!    Great place...can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Dane, even though I often don't drink while there. Their food is always made with fresh, quality ingredients. It's a great place for vegetarians and people who are healthy eaters in general, while still appealing to those who prefer typical pub fare.  Tonight I ordered the salad with sashimi grade tuna. The tuna was truly excellent, which may be a surprise coming from a brewery. I am on a clean eating bender for a couple weeks so I requested a few modifications to the salad, to which they gladly obliged. This included replacing the soy-peanut dressing with their basil vinaigrette. What a great decision that was!  My husband had the Cuban sandwich, which is something he often orders. It was huge and he said it tasted great.  The staff are friendly and our waitress was prompt and took good care of us (and wasn't annoyed when I asked for modifications to my meal).  We visit Fitchburg and Cottage Grove Dane locations quite often with our cycling group, and we have found all locations to have consistent food quality and service."}
{"text":"Great Dane sits along the corner of a few streets and the space spans a traditional dining room, bar, and pool/darts section with tables.   We came here later on a Thursday evening and the place was hopping. Despite giving our number and getting a confirmation text with a wait time of 15 minutes, after 30 we'd heard nothing. I checked in with the hostess and said they had no wait list and must have missed up. I generally like this system of text/calling, but it has to work. Fortunately, this was the only misstep we encountered.   The menu is eclectic. Burgers, local favorites, pub food, Indian, and African fare to mention a few categories. I had the African Peanut Stew and a pretzel. Both were great. The pretzel was awesome! It reminded me of being in Bavaria!  Others in my party enjoyed the cheese steak with jalapeno sauce and the burger with sausage. Clean plates and compliments all around.   While the place was big and busy, our service was quick, efficient, and impressive. I'd come back if I was ever in town again. I don't think you can get tired of their menu options!"}
{"text":"Great fish fry! I love the beer! It's usually packed enough to have a healthy buzz, but it's never too packed. In nice weather, there's a patio where you can sit outside. While the view isn't of anything more than a mall, it's still nice to sit out in the sun...especially since I am writing this in January! The beer bread is always a favorite of mine too :)"}
{"text":"It's....pretty good.   The Great Dane is a solid option if you're looking for seating/hang-out space for a group with various tastes. They can accommodate parties of all sizes pretty well. Came here with a very large group last week and they did allow us to reserve  - plus.  For me, the food is pretty decent - nothing extravagant or out-of-ordinary, but usually, as the 3-star rating indicates, \"A-OK.\" I've been here a few times and have tried various options - fish tacos, mac and cheese, cheese curds, etc. Not bad food by any means, but again - not great. It's a good and easy choice when you're with a group, however, as the menu is eclectic (peanut stew to falafel to wings - huh?) and the prices are affordable.  I DO really enjoy the root beer here (they brew it!). Try some!"}
{"text":"Wow! My sisters and I are from vegas visiting our older sister who lives in Wisconsin. Came here twice and loved it each time! Omg great beer great food! What more can you ask for? Can't wait to go to next years beer Fest and visit this place again."}
{"text":"This is a pretty solid place with decent beer.  I used to get growlers here once in awhile and we like to gather here if we're back in town for a football game or something.  The back patio area is cool.  Overall a nice brew pub in a good location."}
{"text":"Wisconsin is known for beer - years ago my dad worked for Heilman Brewery in LaCrosse.  The tradition continues at the four Great Dane Brewery locations.  I had to try the cheese curds. I was so stuffed I could only order another starter.  I went for the Juicy Brewskies - bratwurst and cheedar sliders with carmelized onions, dill pickle slice and horseradish mustard on a pretzel bun.  It was so big, it didn't ever fit in MY big mouth!  When I tried to squeeze it down, the cheese oozed out of the bratwurst patty!  The other food item I ordered was BEEF JERKY.  They have a jar of homemade beef jerky sitting behind the bar.  For $3 per piece, it was very fresh and tasty, albeit a tad bit salty.  Overall was perfect to go with the IPA I enjoyed.  The place was crowded for a snowy January Tuesday night in Madison... lots of different age groups and types of patrons.  In the other room were pool tables, and I didn't look around much beyond where we sat in the bar area and watched (then) #3 UW lose their first game of the 2014 season to unranked Indiana (boo!)  Despite the loss, the mood of the bar was lifted by the good beer and food."}
{"text":"My son loves this place and goes to all 3 locations in Madison. I found it noisy, crowded, and noticed the sticky floors on the way to the bathroom. My food here was beer can chicken, much less tasty (skin was slimy wet) than we make ourselves at home. This place was less than I expected based on the many good reviews, and especially my son's otherwise good taste."}
{"text":"This is a great go-to spot for my friends and I. There's a great patio for warm weather and some cool seating on the second floor (in one area, there are two pour-your-own tap tables that charge by the ounce). The asian noodle salad is delicious and not over dressed. It's hearty, too - I never finish it, but it's a great leftover dish, too. My husband and I are obsessed over the inner warmth peanut stew, and the pretzel roll is perfect to sop up every drop of the slightly spicy and peanutty sauce. I tried the almond infused cous cous, and will make that my side from now on- yum!   This is also the perfect place to go for a Badger game, and their Sunday brunch has pretty much everything you would ever want and more! The only reason I'm giving them 4 out of 5 is that sometimes parking is a huge hassle, and it's never fun to walk a long way in bad/cold weather. It's worth it, though."}
{"text":"The beer was *amazing*, and the nachos are both huge and delicious. Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"The Dane (all locations) is a great staple in Madison that never disappoints. For the food, the Inner Warmth Peanut Stew is a very tasty and filling entree that lives up to the title's promise. If you like peanut, I also recommend the soba noodle and tuna salad.  If you really like to have a great brunch buffet to indulge yourself in on a Sunday, theirs is the best I have ever been to and I definitely recommend going with friends (expect to want a nap afterward, though).   Also, at least at the Fitchburg location, you can sit at a table that has its own taps that you can just pay for your beer after it adds up the ounces you poured yourself - SUCH a great idea!  The Dane is a brewpub, but it's noise level is definitely family friendly and includes a great mix of a sports bar ambiance with areas of more intimacy."}
{"text":"Great Dane has to be the first brew pub I've been in that has outstanding food.  Everything I've ever ordered has exceeded my expectations.  My favorite is the big 10 burrito, not something I would expect to be so good outside of a Mexican restaurant but it has a wonderful variety of ingredients.  A bonus is the beer is great and you can even get a jug to go!  Yippee!"}
{"text":"Great Dane was my first meal in Madison. It's a large-menu pub style restaurant: you can get any kind of meat, any kind of cheese, and any kind of potato, cooked any which way, with a beer, at this restaurant. I've also been told it has many Madison locations. They have enough vegetarian options too, but you better like cheese. My friend and I were visiting town, and ended up meeting a few people for dinner here.  I had the old glory cheese curds and the Wisconsin style cheddar mac. I'm disappointed in myself because I didn't take pictures. The cheese curds were okay: this was my first taste of fried cheese curds, and Great Dane's tasted mostly like a premium mozzarella stick, but without the marinara dipping sauce. Only later did I discover that you could buy bags of fresh cheese curds at Saturday farmer's market for much cheaper, and that this method of consuming dairy products was much more delicious. The mac and cheese was a bit disappointing. There's really not that much cheese, and it's quite plain. Next time, I ought to add hot sauce on my own, or copious amounts of salt and pepper.  The server we had was very friendly. When I asked him if he could charge my phone for me, he was helpful and said even though there's a \"pay to charge\" kiosk on the bar side of Great Dane, he could do it for me.  I'd come back if I were meeting up with a larger group of friends in Madison, but there are plenty of pub-like American, traditional, blah blah blah places to eat in Madison to try, so it could be a while."}
{"text":"Hmmm...wanted to try a place other than Old Fashioned and a friend that used to go to Wisconsin-Madison recommend this place.  I gotta say, the ambiance is nice and I bet this would be a great place to throw some drinks down, but I was here for food.  I did have 1 beer which they brew onsite and it was decent.  The food however, was mediocre.  The Cheese Curds were average, definitely not Old Fashioned quality and you get far fewer for more money.  Just FYI, cheese curds here are $9 for about 12 pieces versus like 30 pieces at Old Fashioned for $6.95.  We also ordered the Poutine which I have to say brought this place from 2 stars to 3 stars.  It was the hit.  Order this here if you come!! It was so good.  I only wish the cheese was melted just a little bit more on the fries.  For my entree I ordered the most expensive sandwich at $12 versus the rest of them at 9-10.  It was the French Dip which the menu made sound like fresh prime rib sliced on a heavenly bun.  It was none of that...what a jip.  I bet it was Boar's Head sliced roast beef stacked on a baguette, cut in half and served with Au Jus.  Not a fan, and would be hard pressed to return."}
{"text":"Love the great dane, the food and beer is amazing!"}
{"text":"We walked in and where greeted by a very nice hostess yesterday. It was kind of weird after that. We sat inside and as we walked towards the back she told us the table she was seating us at was reserved at 5:30 so we had to be done by that time. It was 4:00 so I said I didn't think that would be a problem. There was only one other table occupied so I wondered if all the tables were reserved at 5:30. It just seemed strange since I've had reservations at other restaurants and have waited up to 2 hours. Anyway it made me feel uncomfortable and like I had to watch the time.  I had the pub burger with fresh vegetables and dip and a side of frys. The vegetables were fresh and the burger was good and lean. My friend had the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and green beans. The meatloaf was not good. You can't over mix the meat it gets mushy and it had too much seasoning. It was actually terrible. It had bbq sauce on it that didn't help. The potatoes were just ok and the green beans were the best part of the meal.  Our waitress was very nice and attentive. She refilled our water which I really liked. I wish she would have cleared our dirty dishes though.  It just wasn't a good experience"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a early lunch.  In and out in 30 minutes.  Be aware it can get crowded here quickly.  Great service.  Had the jerk pork tacos.  Amazing is all I can say!  Full on $15 including my drink."}
{"text":"As it turns out there are a lot of great places in Madison for beer. This place used to be one of them but it has rested far too much on its laurels and has declined precipitously in its service. I find that the service in Madison is routinely excellent. Perhaps servers aren't as knowledgable as in some big cities but they are generally very friendly and care about the customer. Not at Great Dane anymore. Last time I was in here I was treated like garbage by one of the clueless bartenders. Shocked by how rudely I was treated I spoke with another worker (unable to find a manager). She was a little less rude but tremendously more condescending. Needles to say I won't be back. There are dozens of place that have great beer AND great service in Madison. Don't need to be talked down to by a bunch of sadly soon-to-be unemployed college students."}
{"text":"Had a nice gluten free menu. Ordered the rootbeer and ginger ale which were tasty but lost flavor after first drink. Ordered the peanut stew over chili rice which was a mushy and more or less flavorless dish served over what appeared to be a zatarain rice. Also had the blackened mango mahi mahi with garlic mash potatoes. Blackened seasoning was tasty but fish didn't have much flavor. Garlic potatoes were the best part of the dish"}
{"text":"Sir -   I am a fan of your hefeweizen. I don't know its name, nor do I have any recollection of how much it cost.  But I could care less about the latter issue because it was amazing and worth however many pennies I spent on it.  Please send me a case of it at your earliest convenience.   Best, Cadence"}
{"text":"Cheese curds?  Outstanding!  Old school ambiance?  Check!  Brew quality?  Fab!  Pub burger?  OMG!!!  Nom nom.  Definitely a good spot to experience Madison vibe and famous fried cheese curds.  Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I love looking at a menu and seeing plenty of vegetarian options.  These were even marked with a carrot - even better!  The group of us came for the beer, and weren't disappointed.  Many choices available.    Of course we started with the cheese curds, which to me seemed like mozzerella sticks but whatever, they were delicious and served with ranch.  The mozzerella salad was pretty good - but I've had better.  It came with tomatoes, red peppers, and asparagus and was a good size, but I prefer mine with less veggies.  I also had to try the mac and cheese, which wasn't as creamy as homemade should be and served with a pretzel - talk about carb on carb overload!    The service was great and fast, especially for our table of 6 on Homecoming weekend."}
{"text":"There are a number of greats places to eat & drink in Madison... so stay away from the cookie cutter franchise places.  I would definitely start with the Great Dane.  They have a great beer garden for summertime & a great atmosphere inside with many pool tables & other forms of entertainment.  They serve up their own microbrew of which Crop Circle is may absolute favorite beer.  They also have three other locations  (four if you count the airport) in Dane County that are nice... but the original near the capital is the best!"}
{"text":"A group of nine of us were lucky enough to get a table here at 8:30 on a Thursday evening. Thursday nights appear to be quite popular with the teams from the Madison Ultimate Frisbee Association (I think they get free beer or something) and practically all of the tables in the place were full. Even with a full house our server was attentive, the food and drinks came out quickly, and the manager stopped by our table to check on us.  Everyone had positive reactions to their food and beer. We had two orders of cheese curds - tasty, crispy coating on the outside and gooey cheese on the inside. I ordered the chicken potpie and loved it. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=KaAXj7XkVXk6YrR_jYyGUg&userid=eqeIvuHRTp8ezyfqWPVxlw Perfect size for a single serving with a light flaky crust on top and vegetables that were cooked perfectly. My friend sitting next to me had the bacon and brat pretzel burger which he loved. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=XjhuLVYnk9Gp8dGr-5kIEw&userid=eqeIvuHRTp8ezyfqWPVxlw Then again what isn't there to love about a burger that consists of a hamburger patty, a bratwurst patty topped with applewood smoked bacon?  The Great Dane was the perfect fit for a group as large as we had - there was something for everyone on the menu and the restaurant is obviously accustomed to dealing with large groups."}
{"text":"Cool pub right in downtown Madison with dual bars plus plenty of pool tables to keep you entertained for a night out with friends. They have a good selection of local beers on tap along with cocktails. Our group came here after a wedding at the Madison Club after midnight. This place was still busy with decent amount of people at the bar and playing pool. My boyfriend got some really delicious drinks made by the manager for only $6 each! Overall, this is a hot spot in downtown Madison for a fun night out with friends and good beers!"}
{"text":"This past Saturday evening I made my way out to Fitchburg after having read some online reviews on Yelp.com and Urbanspoon.com and several of the hit items the Great Dane serves up. I even found some images on the net that really sold me on making a stop this past weekend to indulge myself in a classic burger that offered something different at the same time. Lets not forget that el fresco dining options never hurts either. At the Great Dane in Fitchburg, you get all that and then some. So let me walk you through the descriptive, visual and sensory pathway that was my \"eat feat\" for this weekend.  Arriving at around 7pm I took the option to sit out at the bar in the \"Garden Dining\" section of the restaurant which I found fairly busy but not overcrowded either. I grabbed a seat and was quickly given attention by one of the bartenders who then kept close tabs on me during my whole stay. Having already seen the online menu I was pretty sure on what I was going to get for an app and entree but dessert still escaped me as no dessert menu was or is listed on the main menu. That I would have to wait and see on.  Brown Ale French Onion Soup $5  This is the real deal when it comes to French Onion Soup! Great flavor, amazing aroma, a thick slice of melted bubbly cheese and then a thick slice of french bread underneath with ample soft, moist, chopped onions to seal the deal. Comes with 2 small whole wheat rolls to dip in and soak up the broth to!  Burger Entree $10.50 + $1.00 for sweet potato fries The Great Dane's Brat and Bacon Pretzel Burger  This burger is certainly what I needed. A classic burger yet something a bit different and not so basic. The pretzel bun all on its own may be to blame for this as its my first exposure to it but even the brat-burger dynamic may have played in, or maybe the bacon-burger-brat did it, or maybe the cheddar cheese-bacon-burger-brat combo to blame?? Who knows and who cares! It was darn good either way! It comes with Pecks Pilsner Mustard which I was quite liberal with to say the least as its a personal favorite condiment of mine so I was sure to see that nothing here was going to waste. Others should be forewarned....this burger is big and despite the bun and its hard pretzel covering to help support the mass of goodness inside, your going to get a little messy trying to eat this whole, even with two hands. Cut this monster in half and then you stand a fighting chance of keeping your hands from the onslaught I encountered (but so worth it!) The additional $1 for sweet potato fries was very well worth it! Warm, crisp and fresh with that smell and taste of real cut sweet potatoes is what I wanted and that is just what I got. A great companion to go with the taste of the burger! I shall note that sweet tater fries are my all time favorite side dish to any burger period, kudos to The Great Dane for offering this option!  Not despite my initial feelings of being full, my curiosity for the dessert menu was still getting the best of me. At about that time my peppy, friendly and very attentive bartender (female who's name I never did catch) asked me if I would like to see the dessert menu.....I instantly obliged!  It took me all but 10 seconds to see the very first item listed was Carrot Cake. My #1 pick for any dessert item anywhere. That said I never even looked at the other 4-5 items listed on the menu, it was a sealed deal when I saw my go-to items listed at the top. More so when it says \"4 layer\" within the subtitle. I took a chance in hopes this would be a spot on hit as many places in the past have sub par versions of \"homemade\" carrot cake which leaves me not so happy to say the least. On this occasion, my taste buds nor my stomach left displeased as this was a pure HIT on all levels.  Carrot Cake: $5.25  Authentic cream cheese frosting, moist layers of cake with real carrot flakes and walnuts. I really took my time to let my taste buds bask in the depth, the richness, the melding flavors of what each bite of real carrot cake is supposed to offer its consumer. Its a darn good thing they serve this by the slice because people like me would have the whole cake gone otherwise.  So in summary, my bill which totaled just over $26 (with drink) was well worth the food quality, quantity, the service, the outdoor dining atmosphere (even took in 5 innings of the sox/brewers game). I have to admit that during my hour stay I really got the feeling that the waitstaff enjoyed working there. They all seemed happy, energetic, lively and social to each other and the customers at all times. Makes you think its not only a good place to eat but also a all round good place to be on any occasion as well.  In my case I come for the food, tonight I was very pleased and must give a strong recommendation for others to give a go with these food items and any others like it. If you find yourself bored and hungry on a Saturday evening, I found"}
{"text":"In for dinner tonight with a large group of 20. Food was great as usual for The Great Dane. Real standout was our server Molly. Big group to deal with on her own. Friendly and professional. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat.  If I could afford to I'd eat there 7 days a week!  My favorites are the Brats N Mash, Chicken Pot Pie, Pan seared Buffalo wings, there Cuban and Reuban sandwhiches and the Brat N Pretzel Bacon Burger which might kill you but it's to die for so it's worth it and boy could I go on and pretty much list the entire menu minus salads and wraps and that stuff.  I went with my brothers kids and tasted their chicken nuggets and even those were excellent.  Top it off with one of their amazing beers and it's the perfect place to eat. Why in the world would someone review a restaruant and pub when they only visited it at closing hour?  NOT ALL BEERS ARE EQUAL!  Great Dane follows the German purity law for brewing and you can tell.  The Pecks Pilsner is 100% better than Heineken."}
{"text":"The food is good, one of the better places to get Great Dane food in the area.  The service, however, is only ok.  I went in one night to after work and was looking for food and a beer after a long day.  The bar wasn't full.  I was seated, along with two other people, and two college girls at the end of the bar.  That night, while I sat down, ordered a beer, mentioned that I was interested in food, ordered food, sat there and ate, paid, and finally left, the bartender said NINE words to me.  \"Maybe he was just keeping it professional?\"  No.  I work in the service industry.  You cannot have a quality or in any form good customer experience without saying more than 9 words the entire night.  \"Maybe he just wasn't a chatty person?\"  No.  He was talking up the two college girls at the end of the bar the entire night, conversations, hitting on them, giving them free drinks left and right.  They were there before I sat down, but while I was there, they didn't pay for a single drink, and the alcohol was flowing.  It was clear that this bartender was using the Great Dane resources to try and get into these girls' pants, and was ignoring other customers to get to his desired destination.  Now to explain how this could happen and The Great Dane could still get 3 stars.  I have been in the service industry long enough to know that one sleezeball does not reflect on the ENTIRE restaurant, or restaurant group.  The food at this location is pretty good.  I'm sure the entire staff does not share this one douche of a bartender's customer service philosophy.  So I won't punish the entire restaurant for one ass of a bartender."}
{"text":"Decent brew pub food.  Really good beer.  I'm a big fan of dark, porter's or Scotch ale. Every one I've tried has been excellent."}
{"text":"Stopping at The Great Dane is a must when I am visiting Madison. On my last visit, we were seated downstairs for dinner. I did not care for the atmosphere at all! It was extremely loud because we were seated right near a bar.  Our server appeared more like a cocktail waitress and wasn't very friendly or helpful.  If I was grabbing a drink, I wouldn't mind. However, when I am having dinner, I need some peace! Nonetheless, great beer and food. I love  the Mac n Cheese with a pretzel! I will be back on my next trip to Madison but will be sure to sit upstairs!"}
{"text":"Overall a good place to have a meal and enjoy some beers.  The atmosphere here is pretty fun. However they do have multiple different sections that can fit the vibe you are looking for, whether it be more casual and fun at the bar, or more private dining.   Their menu does not make me do back flips with excitement, but I can't say anything bad about it either.  It is decent food that I have enjoyed multiple times.   The Great Dane does do a good job of brewing their own beer, and so it is a must to try some of their own beers.   Favorite Menu Item:  Poutine  - Honestly the best poutine in town. Perfect combo of that gravy, fry, cheese-curd goodness."}
{"text":"This place was bumpin!!! Cheese curds were incredible. Chiangmai curry was the best thing I've ever eaten. Beet salad was ok. Grass-fed burger was so-so. Excellent service, cool vibe!"}
{"text":"Was here last night as it was close to our hotel and we were in town for the game. It was very nice inside, clean and definitely my type of atmosphere. We were exhausted after the game, so didn't head back out until almost 9 to grab something to eat.  It was a little louder than I usually like it to be when I'm tired and out for dinner, but it was 9 pm on a Saturday night, so should definitely be expected. Other than that, the place was great.  I loved the menu, there were about 10 things I wanted to try. But what I did have was great, the hot buffalo wings were AWESOME.  and the Macaroni and Cheese Pizza (I was super curious, as this isn't generally something found on a pizza) was very good as well.   Beer - great and the service was very good as well. I will definitely go back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"In short, Great Staff, Great Food, Great Beers!! This was an unusual family gathering due to the fact that we all got together for a funeral.   Our bartender and waitress were Absolutely AWESOME!! Too bad the Tuscany Grill messed up because our business went straight to the Great Dane Pub, spent almost 2k between the 40 of us... the tips were very handsome!!  Thanks Gals @ the Great Dane Pub!!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: kinda had the English pub thing going on Beverages: I don't drink so the rootbeer was the highlight for me, but if you are a beer drinker they have a ton to choose from Food: I had the chicken pot pie... it was pretty good... my wife had the beer can chicken, not too impressed there Service: good"}
{"text":"If you live in or around Madison you'll end up eating in a Great Dane a couple of times a year like it or not. It's kind of a default restaurant for many people. Maybe the beer is so good that people just have to go there... but the food is at best average. I wouldn't make a special point of going to this or any of the other GD locations because I'm local and there are so many better options .... unless it's for their Sunday brunch which is better than most."}
{"text":"My wife and I go out for \"date night\" in Madison every couple of months. When we go, we usually either eat at Great Dane or AJ Bombers. We like the food better at AJ Bombers, but you can't beat the beer at Great Dane.   Great Dane has an enormous menu selection and most of the food is terrific. The burgers are great and the soups are delicious. However, I DO NOT recommend the fish fry. The fish is overcooked, over breaded and thin. It's like you're eating an over-fried piece of breading.   We like going to brew pubs, and as far as the beer goes, Great Dane is top notch. In my opinion, it is even better than Water Street Brewery in Milwaukee and the Capital Brewery in Madison.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The Great Dane encompases most of the things I miss about Wisconsin..  1) Great \"homebrew\" style beer (particularly of the wheat variety) 2) Good ole midwestern food...Beer Can Chicken anyone?? 3) Cheap Cheap Cheap. Of course I will stuff my face silly with 2 beers, an appetizer, and a huge meal all for $13 :) 4) AMAZING company and welcoming atmosphere....  Madison, I would move back to you in a heartbeat if it wasnt for those 6+ month long winters and below zero temperatures :("}
{"text":"This is the first place I ate at after moving to Madison, and it's definitely a Madisonian staple! My favorite thing to order is their steak salad!   The Dane is a huge restaurant. In the summer, the beer garden is perfect to grab a drink and hang out at. I also frequent here late night as well. Pool tables, shuffle board, darts, beer, and cheese curds what more can I ask for?!"}
{"text":"Wonderful pub restaurant in Madison, WI A great view of the capital is close by. Great selection of beer and excellent pub food, with a varied selection. We came with a large party and were given a beautiful large table by a window. The Great Dane mascot was an impressive addition."}
{"text":"Date of my visit: 24-March-2018 Time of my visit: Late night, after dinner  My girlfriend really liked the great dane beer handle.  After calling several locations, this was the only one that had one available for sale.  So we decided to stop by and pick one up.  The manager, we've spoken to, was extremely courteous and helpful.  The process was streamlined and we were in and out, very quickly.  Overall an A experience!"}
{"text":"We did not eat here, so this review is only for the beer/bar and service.  My boyfriend and I came here to watch the IU homecoming football game (yes, it was pathetic), and grab a couple of beers.  We sat at the only two seats open at the main (?) bar.  The TV on our end was showing some sports documentary without sound, and the IU game was on at the far end.  Once a few people moved from the other end, we asked the bartender if we could move down to see the game.  She said that was fine and didn't offer to change this TV that clearly nobody was watching.  OK, no big deal so we moved.  I had two pints of the IPA while I was here and they tasted totally different from one end of the bar to the other (came from different taps).  I'm still not really sure it was the same beer ; I really enjoyed the first one but not the second.  My boyfriend tried a sampler with 4 beers then ended up getting two other ones in pints, and wasn't really a fan of any of them.  The biggest part of the two stars is the service.  We were sitting at the bar for at least two hours, and I think we got asked once if we needed anything.  The rest of the time was us flagging down the bartender.  At first it was busy, and then at one point an entire wedding part bride and all stopped by, so I definitely understand them being prioritized.  However, for at least half the time we were there, the bar was mostly empty and we still had to flag people down.  Once we moved to the far end of the bar to watch the game, we were right next to the area were waiters use the computer to put in orders and get drinks from the bartender.  It was basically like watching reality TV.  They snapped at each, complained to a manager about each other, etc.  It was actually really amusing for me, but not the best portrayal of a business.  Their menu did look really good, and if I lived in the area I would give it another chance for dining.  However, if you are just visiting, there are lots of other amazing places I would recommend before this one."}
{"text":"My online boyfriend, now husband, took me here when I visited him in Madison. The pub was cozy and nicer than I expected. I loved their cheese-curds! Why aren't they available nation wide??"}
{"text":"This is definitely a meat, potatos, and beer type of pub. The portions are generous, the staff is friendly, and they have all the local beers to get you started for the evening. On game days, it can get a bit crowded, but that's part of the appeal. This definitely has a slight college bar feel to it, and the crowd seems to be younger.   Evenings, this place is a good place to grab few drinks and apps to pregame. It is within walking distance of the capital and all of the other \"get wasted\" bars. Drop by for a quick lunch at this iconic bar or meet up with your bros here before heading out to Paul's Club for a wild night."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE The Great Dane! I live a few blocks away from their Fitchburg location but have only been there 3 times. The downtown Madison brewery is where it's at! They have wonderful staff that are incredibly friendly, bubbly and nice! Management is hands on and that in and of itself is quite refreshing.   Food menu choices are varied and eclectic which is quite lovely. I'm sure most patrons expect the standard pub fare and yes those staples are there but vegetarian options and twists on the traditional are mouth watering!   Saving the best for last... the beers. Their selections are pretty incredible! They have seasonal and gluten free options so no one is left out! They now can! You can get your favorite beer in a growler that is an alternative to the glass ones that everyone has. Also! They have 6 packs!   There is something for EVERYONE at The Great Dane! Even history buffs will love it since the building used to be a furniture store and hotel in the early 1900's! Go enjoy a cold one downstairs or the patio and you'll be immersed in Madison history!   It'll be a great time and being that close  to the capitol you just can't go wrong!  CHEERS!"}
{"text":"Will be back to try other things. The wrap was \"Okay\" and the beer I had was \"okay\" I will just have to try something new next time. The place itself is really cute inside."}
{"text":"Yeah I'm a fan. For a local chain this place is good. Be prepared to get packed in like cattle during games but that should be expected. Plus, game days are always fun when it is busy and boozy"}
{"text":"I wasn't totally looking forward to eating here because I thought it was typical Americana fare but I did enjoy it. We sat in the outdoor area and it was a great place to talk and eat. The drinks were good and the service was better than expected. I had a muffuletta which was more of a ham sandwich with some olive spread -- not a traditionally made muffuletta. The others I ate with had food that looked much better, including the kids meals my kids had!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite bars in Madison. My girlfriend took me to a couple of bars and restaurants around the Capital building, and I enjoyed my time in the Great Dane the most out of any of them.  The atmosphere is very laid back during the weekdays, which is a nice change of pace from the nights filled with drunken stupor whilst stumbling around State Street with all of my fellow inebriated, tuition paying colleagues.   They brew their own beers here, and I think that they are all fantastic. My personal favorites are the Devil Lakes Red Lager, Crop Circle Wheat (seems to be their best seller), and the Pecks Pilsner.   I've never had the chance to eat at this place before, but they seem to get their cliental to frequently order food (most everyone in here was eating), and the other people looked like they frequented the Great Dane quite a bit (a lot of businessmen stop by here during their lunch hour for a beer and a sandwich it appears).   My favorite thing about this place is how nice their \"bar games\" setup is. I'm the stereotypical jock that obnoxiously ALWAYS has to be winning and thinks everything is a competition. Because of this, I'm an atrocious bar games snob. If bar games were the equivalent to being addicted to crack cocaine, this place would be my drug dealer on speed dial (just go with it?).  For starters, the thing that keeps me and my arm candy coming back for more is the shuffleboard. Not too many places have a shuffleboard, let alone a nice one like they have. Second, they have two nice electronic dartboards. The dartboards are located where dartboards should be; in the corner where no one walks by. I've been to too many bars where I fear that I might accidentally throw a dart into someone's jugular because people are constantly walking in front of me during a throw, but not here. Every time that I've been to this watering hole, I have always seen the dart boards in use. Lastly, but certainly not least, their beloved pool tables. I'm almost certain The Great Dane Pub on E Doty has been voted \"The best place to shoot pool in Madison\" two years running - and for good reason. They have four, count em' FOUR, sweet pool tables. They are very classy tables, and to take it a step further, some of the nicest pool table setups I've seen in a public establishment. The felt stretching over them is clean and crisp, the balls always seem to be in top notch shape, and their pool cue are sweetness. It's no wonder that they are perpetually busy.  Free pool and shuffleboard after 9PM on Sunday's!! But if I'm in town, I better not see your face around these parts because I'll have to hustle you in shuffleboard.  Overall, this place is the cat's pajamas in my opinion. If you are looking for somewhere to have a beer or two while you take your buddies lunch money in a game of pool, shuffleboard, or darts; I would come here without a doubt."}
{"text":"Food is very good but service is rarely anything above average. Overall a nice place to hang out"}
{"text":"The Great Dane is somewhere fun to go with a group of friends. They have a large selection of food, which is usually pretty good. They brew their own beers, which are always quite popular among the guys (I am not a beer drinker...) In the lower lever they have pool tables, shuffle board and other various games to keep you entertained. Overall a fun spot to go to."}
{"text":"Excellent beers, and definitely the very best cheese curds I've ever enjoyed. Wife says the Beet Salad is worth the trip.   But, they need more presentation information about the beers on tap, especially the specials. Barmaid was unable to conjure up anything about the specials except that \"it's the only IPA we serve\".   Not a rousing endorsement.   But nice place - we sat upstairs and could actually hear each other talking.   !!why do restaurants think they need so much noise in the background ???  This was a nice place to spend an afternoon and would recommend it."}
{"text":"Great beer? Check. Excellent cheese curds? Check. Standout service? Check. All I have to say is this place delivers. And Dan the bartender is as good as they get. Give that man a raise!"}
{"text":"Standard. Their beers aren't the best, but you can count on consistency in the meal."}
{"text":"The service was very discombobulated and they seemed very understaffed. Everyone was very nice- but it was just kind of frustrating. The food was pretty good. The place is huge and in an old building. I think with more help it'd be 4 stars."}
{"text":"Went here for a date with the hubby on a Thursday night. First impressions: it was PACKED! We were seated promptly. We could smell the beer brewing. Love the menu's (they are folded like a newspaper.  We got a 6-beer flight and nachos to start with. The menu is pretty eclectic - reminded us of one of our fave St. Louis brewery (Schlafly's). The food - the nacho's were fantastic!! My grilled cheese with onion beer jam was very good. The pub fries were kind of disappointing. The beer selection was very good."}
{"text":"You must try the meatloaf, it's the ONLY reason I head to this restaurant when I am in town! The drinks are tasty and the apps are also good, but the meatloaf, it's amazing!!"}
{"text":"Picked because of proximity to hotel. Made a good choice! Great varied menu for a pub place. Loved the meatloaf on a cold rainy day after a long car ride."}
{"text":"I have been to The Great Dane many times over the years. It is always great. They only serve their beer, but I enjoy their beer. I went there last night for dinner and had the American Pale Ale. It was great.   We sat outside on the patio in back. It is a great atmosphere. Service was great. Our server was very friendly and attentive. We started with the poutine and some wings. They were both great. The gravy on the poutine was great and the garlic cheese curds were delicious with the gravy and fries. I also really enjoyed the wings. They had great flavor and sauce.  I had the Mandarin Chicken Salad. The salad was very fresh and the teriyaki chicken on top was great.   I look forward to my next visit to The Great Dane."}
{"text":"My only complaint about the Great Dane Brewing company is that it made me miss my college days.  This is a wonderful little eatery that has nice, laid back vibe to it. Our server was wonderful and made sure that our beer glasses were full.  There is a beautiful outdoor seating area in the back and a beautifully decoded indoor area.  We had the boneless wing appetizer. The portions were generous and the sauce (while not hot) was quite tasty.  The burger that I had was juicy and delicious. The next time we are in Madison, we will be sure to stop back in."}
{"text":"I had a great burger here. I met up with some friends and their family and had a nice dinner. Sadly I didn't get a beer."}
{"text":"I'll make this short and sweet.   My first time for cheese curds, oh yes.   Red Ale on Nitro, love it love it love it.  Oktoberfest German meal special, are you kidding me... amazing.  Cute & friendly waitress... does it get any better?"}
{"text":"I love the Great Dane.  Here's the thing - the food is ok.  Actually even good.  But the beers are spectacular.  Absolutely top notch.  They should start giving a nobel prize for beer, and this brewmaster should get it.    And in a world where we waste European water by drinking Belgian beer in San Francisco, and deplete all our natural resources by shipping crates full of heavy beer bottles all over the globe, I think one of the most thoughtful environmental steps any beer-drinker can take is to drink local brews.    Think Globally - Drink Locally!  It's my mantra. The Great Dane makes that more than easy.  Out in San Francisco we've got Trumer, Anchor, Lagunitas, Big Daddy, Boont, Biersch, Magnolia - heck, even Budweiser is brewed only 90 miles away.  We've got lots of options.  And Madison, Wisconsin?  What are its options?  Well, Great Dane isn't the *only* local beer in Madison (this is Wisconsin after all - we know from beer in Wisconsin) - but it's the best.  Think Globally - Drink Great Dane!"}
{"text":"I had driven up from Chicago for business and was in Madison for the day.  The pub was right next to my hotel (Candlewood Suites) and I was looking to grab a bite to eat back in my hotel room.  I drove over (but could actually walk) to the place.  I had to look for the entrance since I drove over and parked in the strip mall parking lot.  The pub was up two flights of stairs if you park in the strip mall parking lot therefore you had to look for the entrance.  (After going up the stairs I realized there was a parking lot in the back that led right into the restaurant.  A little stair climbing is good if you don't have any medical issues.)  I ordered a Southwestern Cobb salad it was pretty good.  I didn't like the roasted peppers and the guacamole dressing but it was fresh and big.  I ended up buying some ranch at the grocery store and used that.  It was tasty, usually I like balsamic vinaigrette but the salad did not have Gorgonzola cheese (WI Cheddar) so I had to go with it.  The place was clean, inviting and had late hours which is welcomed on a Sunday night.  They even had free games/Wii and happy hour.  I would come back and get beer and one of the heartier dishes when I return for business."}
{"text":"Great Dane has good pub food, including chicken pot pie (seasonal), burgers, beer cheese soup. Their beer selection is good and I'm forgiving them for the one time I had the chills and vomited after drinking only one beer (clean your taps more often!). Caters to your average joe and the baseball cap wearing crowd, so I wouldn't normally go just to drink."}
{"text":"We were extremely impressed with this brewpub, our experience clearly putting this at or near the top of the class amongst all the ones to which we have been.  The steak chimichurri salad was huge and prepared excellently, the lettuce and other vegetables all fresh and good quality, the steak tender and beautifully cooked rare to medium rare, and the dressing flavourful yet delicate.  Kids' meals were great also, especially the nice, crisp and flavourful happy-face tater-tot-type fries.  Beer that we had was excellent and they have a wide selection with a good cask range, as well.  The place itself is nice inside with a traditional old-fashioned pub character plus patio seating in the back.  It also has a great location downtown about a block from the capitol."}
{"text":"I dined at this establishment for a wedding rehearsal dinner, which facilitated a relaxing and unwinding atmosphere to meet everyone. Service was good for the three-table party I was a part of. Their half pound Atlantic cod fillet baked with a lemon herb crust was so well cooked and flavorful that I didn't feel the need to eat it with the side of drawn butter. The cod fillet was moist and flaked off easily with a fork, and its golden-brown lemon herb crust was light, crumbly and crispy. The couscous, though light and airy and with the almond slivers providing a nice crunch, could use some broth to give it moisture. The steamed green beans dressed simply in oil gave the whole meal homeliness. The salad preceding the main course was served with choice of balsamic vinaigrette, French or ranch dressing, all of which were quite thin and not overwhelming on the taste palate."}
{"text":"A perfect place to gorge on a plethora of deep fried appetizers. I just moved back here from Massachusetts and had a HUGE hankering for some unhealthy grub. It was fed well here. Order the cheese curds (A-, could be gooey-er), giant pretzel (b+, put the butter on the pretzel. Mustards are interesting but not great. I was looking forward to a cheese or honey mustard and had neither), and poutine (c+/b-, little cheese, novelty dill curds melted on top but not near enough cheese to fulfill the ratio. We also had to flip the dish upside down in order to get gravy everywhere).  However, it was all fulfilling. The service was speedy. The rootbeer and ginger ale brewed fresh and refills so fast your head will spin."}
{"text":"Great burgers, great beers. Never disappointed. & if you get a chance to try their black & tan cheddar burger . And if you're a mustard fan you must try their pilsner mustard. Ask for a side... You'll want to dip your fries in it! Believe it or not, root beer isn't very good there-too syrupy with no root beer \"bite\"."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite and a beer at this Madison staple. We had the giant pretzel as an appetizer. It was served with homemade mustards which were really tasty, but the pretzel itself was dry and looked and tasted frozen.   For the main course, I tried the Texarkana burger, which was a burger with onion rings and barbecue sauce. I asked for it medium, but the burger's texture was somewhere between a hockey puck and a door mat. I'm not afraid to complain in restaurants, but the food took a while to arrive and I didn't want to keep my entire group waiting (and the waitress's attitude left much to be desired).   The rest of the burger wasn't bad; the ingredients were reasonably fresh, and the sweet potato fries were crisp without the grease.   Their beer selection was decent (don't be prepared to find any Miller Lite on tap). I tried a light Czech pilsner and an amber beer, both of which were above average.   At the end of the day, The Great Dane is a fine place to grab a beer (hence the 3 stars), but I'd go elsewhere to actually eat something."}
{"text":"Went here when I was in Madison for a few days. I was greatly impressed by the size of TGD--three upstairs areas plus a beer garden below.  The major downside was the lack of respect for dining patrons. Some party of 6-7 adults showed up with their bad ass caravan of 12+ kids and let their rowdiness neign. Instead of a manager politely informing them to quiet down or gtfo, two waitstaff were stuck serving them. Honestly,  I'm 1000% from children being banned from places that serve copious amounts of alcohol. BUT, the food was alright and I had some lovely beer flights, so it wasn't a total loss."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Love this place.  Great selection on house beers.  Has several pool tables.  A shuffle board table.  Very open place but also pool and shuffle board have there own area open but separate.  I was at the bar 2 hours and never even noticed them until I left."}
{"text":"Solid beer menu and a good spot for groups for dinner/drinks. The wait was longer than expected when we stopped by for an early dinner on a Friday afternoon. Menu is extensive - we tried the pub burger and it was a decent meal.  Very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for lunch on the way to a bike race in Minnesota.  Sometimes in gastropubs that serve their own beer the food or beer can be kind of lacking.  It is hard to do both well, mainly because it requires a major investment in two separate areas and not everybody is willing or able to do that.  Great Dane did very well in both areas.  The food was down right superb.  I had the curry noodle dish made with fresh pasta and it was a great choice.  The other guy ordered the fish and chips along with the cheese curds and I was jealous.  I had their porter with the meal and it was everything a porter should be - smoky and in your face grain.  I would hit this place again if it wasn't so far from home."}
{"text":"+ The best beer-battered cheese curds ever + Wonderful house beer + Reasonable prices + Peppered salmon with Pico de gallo wasn't overcooked, quite the feat for a brewpub + Waitress was pleasant and attentive + Beer bread and honey butter? Yes, please.  - The music was AWFUL and LOUD (I do not want to listen to generic, crappy club electronica while I eat, thanks) - The place was a bit drafty"}
{"text":"My wife and I had some friends and thier children visit us from Rockford, IL.  So we decieded to take them downtown Madison for a tour and some good eats.  My buddy and I both love craft beer so I thought Great Dane would be a cool place to go.  The kids could play pool, darts, shuffle board and so much more.   We did flights of beers so we could try everything.  Very tasty!  As for the food this place is always great.  I had the best dish ever.....  Smotherd fried Chicken cutlets with all types of goodoes on it.  Andoullie sausage, artichoke hearts, a delicous sauce served with jalepeno mashed potatos topped with cheese and a side of fresh green beans.  Oh my..... a top ten best dish i've ever had!  Our friends had some amazing fish tacos and a plate licking burger.  Everything was served looking beautiful.  Well crafted and plated.  My wife had a California turkey club which she said was wonderful.  Always happy when all four people, plus our kids enjoy thier meals.  Kids had bowl of baked potato soup, a great burger, and a rueben!  Well done Great Dane!  We will be back again with another large group!"}
{"text":"This is always a good place to grab a bite and a brew! Friendly staff, great atmosphere. The Dane burger is my go to but the rest of the menu is good as well. My over all favorite is the brown ale soup."}
{"text":"One of the best brew pubs in Wisconsin. Great food. Very Good Beer. Sit out back in the garden in the summer."}
{"text":"Ambience in the garden is magnificent with attention given to the landscaping. Staffing by management was less than adequate. Pleasant server was overwhelmed and lacked support. Manager was oblivious when this was brought to their attention."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last night with a group for drinks, the great Dane is a alright bar. It was crowded and loud, but interesting. It wasn't quit my cup of tea, it was pricey and a little uppity."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start. Amazing service, amazing food, and amazing beer. Our server was so friendly! I ended up going with one of his recommendations and couldn't have been happier. Our beers were all soo good! I love trying new places but it will be hard to go anywhere but here anytime I'm in Madison. I highly recommend this place to anyone in then area. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great Dane is the classic can't go wrong place to take any group  to Dinner in Madison and anyone will find something they would like.  The beer is solid, they have an amazing patio in the summer, and you can always find a group of 20-something's hanging out in the bar... there are some good things, but on to the updates.  Last week, I went for dinner and the food was inexcusable. The cheese curds were very greasy and almost all breading (no cheese). A friend and I got the sustain-a-burger and it was one of the worst burgers I had in a while. Not sure if they are getting complaisant or it was just a fluke, but I've lost all confidence in the Great Dane's food."}
{"text":"We stopped for a late night dinner at the Great Dane Brew Pub on our way to Chicago. It had a nice atmosphere; I could definitely see us spending a lot of time here if we lived in the area. I am not a beer drinker but I did love their root beer. My husband *loves* beer and really enjoyed all of the ones that he tried.  My pot pie was delicious and my husband's burger was really good. If we ever find ourselves in the area again we would go back for sure."}
{"text":"I love the Great Dane and have been here many times. A few of my fave's include, the mac and cheese, the black and tan burger and the nachos. All three are great, and I usually have a hard time deciding!"}
{"text":"Visited on my last visit home from Hawaii.  The beer sampler was great and the nachos were huge and tasty.  We really enjoyed the atmosphere in the back garden area.  Service was also very good.  Only complaint was that they didn't have a t-shirt we wanted for a souvenir."}
{"text":"This is a great place that I just keep going back to.  Love their California wrap with avocado...if it isn't on the menu I can usually convince the waiter to get a cook to make it for me...it's worth asking for.  I don't have much experience with the beers...but my guy friends have only the best things to say about the beer on tap.  I love the brew-pub atmosphere and the mized crown you can find there. 5 Stars"}
{"text":"Pretty good macaroni and cheese as well as the tomato panzanella salad. They make their own beer as well as soda (red cream soda, ginger ale, and cola maybe?). The service is pretty good. It can get really loud here, but they are accommodating of larger groups."}
{"text":"The Great Dane probably deserves about 3.5 stars. I have been to both the downtown and Hilldale locations and my experiences have been very mixed. The food seems to be consistently good downtown, I especially enjoyed the chipotle bbq sauce served with the quesadillas (I should also say that I don't normally enjoy the flavor of chipotle peppers). I went to the Hilldale location shortly after it opened and was surprised to find out that they weren't even serving their own beers! This may have been changed since, as it was due to a stupid Madison law, but the Great Dane's beers are generally delicious and it was a big downer to have to settle for a crappy Miller Lite. While I was there I tried the brat and burger combo served on a pretzel roll. It was inedible. In the past I have had the combo using a red brat, which works quite well, but what I got was an overdone burger topped with a black (originally white), completely burned sausage. I tossed it aside and choked down the rest of the burger, but the salt on the pretzel roll was overwhelming. I'd recommend this restaurant if you want very good pub food, just stick to the downtown location."}
{"text":"A microbrewery with good food - had a memorable meal here with friends and our kids.  Nice service despite the vast space, which was packed to the gills by the time we were done with dinner.  Good beer, and you don't need a lot of it to enjoy the food.  I had a pot pie....ohwow.  Sit outside and enjoy the ivy-covered walls."}
{"text":"Solid 4/5. Classic Madison, good ole reliable standby, can't go wrong with the Dane. Nice little home brew selection (especially the Verruct). Good food, good enough where it makes you say, every so often, let's go to the Dane! Went there (downtown Madison location) for NYE 2012 and 2013 and had a blast! Pool tables suck compared to Brass Ring (if you are looking for billiards). Overall quality, lasting experience that brings you there multiple times."}
{"text":"this pub was across the street from our hotel so we decided to give it a shot---we were pleased.  went at Oktoberfest time, and they had some special meals for the season--very good.  their Oktoberfest beer was good also.  went back a second night and had some items from their regular menu---again very good---meatloaf was tasty and mashed potatos were excellent!!!  nice atmosphere also---A+++++"}
{"text":"I LOOOOOOOVED THIS PUB! We ate there on a warm summer night and had the pleasure of dining outside in the ridiculously romantic patio area. It was perfect. We ordered beers all around and an order of beer-steamed mussels to start. I have been day-dreaming about the mussels ever since. They came in a big pot full of steam and their own deliciousness, and each mussel was a bundle of joy. For dinner I ordered an Asian-style salad, and I enjoyed every bite. I ate at the Great Dane Pub several weeks ago, and ever since then I have been aching to go back.   In short: I know that there are a lot of pubs in Madison, but the Great Dane Pub & Brewing Company stands out among them!"}
{"text":"With a name like Great Dane, I was expecting a big ass Viking Thor lookalike with a hammer greets me by the door; or, ...a big huge dog. However, it was a tiny young woman who welcomed us. Nevertheless, the name sounds awesome  Two coworkers of mine who are a Swede and a Dane used to argue all the time on who's better. The Dane said it is the happiest country in the world. The Swede said Danes are happy because when they wake up they can see Sweden. The Swede guy used to say too that there's only one great Dane, and it is a dog. They would go on and on and I really want to take the two here! Look! Another Great Dane!! It's a restaurant!!  I saw the brew kettles as we entered the dining area. Then, I saw on the board.. Pumpkin Ale. Oh, that sounded good! Too bad, we were at business lunch.   Perusing through the menu that looked like a tabloid newspaper, it didn't take me long to identify what I wanted though the menu was a sizable one. I just surrendered to Haddock fish fry. I've been trying to avoid fried foods; but, it was haddock. I love haddock. I love fish fry. I can't help myself.  I also tried their tomato and mushroom soup. My customer who was dining with me opted for Reuben and the potato soup.  My soup was interesting and very savory. I loved it. It was more like a minestrone than a Campbell Tomato soup. The potato soup looked good too but it looked heavy to me. It was a meal on its own. However, my dining companion seemed to enjoy it.  The fish fry was excellent! I must say I am not a fan of beer battered fish fry that looked like a long balloon. It looked puffed out and smooth. I usually like it lightly battered and it forms to the fish shape. However, this one was good. The haddock also tasted delicious with the malt vinegar. The fries were a bit spicy as they tossed it in a mixed spice type salt. The Reuben was filled with corned beef and krauts. It was huge!  The service was super fast and our server did a great job during the lunch rush. I didn't get the Great Dane name even after I ate there. I knew it was named after the dog breed, but why. Next time, I will have to really look for clues. Oh yeah, I am coming back. Hopefully for dinner. Maybe their Ale is as good as the one served to Odin in Valhalla."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place.  There were a lot of choices in Madison, but we chose to go here our first night and subsequently the following day for lunch because the meal we had in the first place was THAT good.  The first night, I decided to branch out and I got meatloaf.  My dining partner ordered the steak and we both loved our meals.  Thank goodness there was a fridge in our room, because we went home with a lot of leftovers.  Their drinks were really good, too, and my friend went home with two bombers from there that he enjoyed thoroughly.  I would definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place has a great patio in the back to enjoy the great weather outdoors! That was probably my favorite part.  My boyfriend and I ordered the falafel sandwich and the Inner Warmth Peanut stew (off their house special list). Both were okay, but nothing wow'ed me. The peanut stew especially just tasted like marinara sauce. I barely tasted peanuts, and even that was a stretch. I'm not a huge fan of marinara sauce in the first place, so this dish was definitely not the right one for me."}
{"text":"Came from out of town for an afternoon tasting and it took forever to get flights even though it wasn't that crowded.  They do have a good selection and the beer was tasty, just wish the place had more of an ambiance and had something unique to it.  We did not try the food but when we are back in the Madison area we will probably try someplace different."}
{"text":"These beers are impressive. Most get above average ratings on Beer Advocate, including the two I sampled: Potter's Run IPA and the Devil's Lake Reed Lager. And they offer a ton on draft, including staples, seasonal and specialty brews.  The space is fun. Plenty of pool tables (by the hour!) and shuffleboard.   We didn't eat, so this rating is for the beer and bar only."}
{"text":"In town for a couple of nights (not long enough!) with my fiancé. We agreed on rounding up to 5 stars. Atmosphere was amazing--we sat outside in the beer garden. Service was excellent. Menu options were vast and well priced. Beer and selection was great--try a flight to sample a bunch. The food was good, but not outstanding. The poutine appetizer was the best thing we had--pretty tasty."}
{"text":"It's cool to enter into a brewery right next to the capitol. The place is iconic with average food but good beers. I had the side of Mac and cheese and was disappointed specially while I was in the dairy state. Reuben sandwich was good but nothing to return"}
{"text":"Can't believe this place is still around!  I've always liked the building, and when we returned recently, we found it pretty much the way I last remember it in the late 1990s (yes, I've been around a while).  Decent (not great) beer and solid food, though nothing spectacular.  I see they've added some new locations; downtown, this would be a good choice for midnight snacking."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 6 on Dec. 1 for lunch.   Service was slow. Some at the table ordered non-alcoholic drinks made in the restaurant. I believe they enjoyed them.   I ordered a chicken wrap ... and some soup. The soup was African? -- and gross. It was thick with a sauce and a LOT of rice, slightly spicy, and with no particular flavor. The chicken wrap (I believe it was called the Mayan) was one of the worst \"wraps\" I've ever eaten. Ever. What flavor it had was off-putting and it contained about 2-3 ounces of chicken. It was primarily a spinach \"wrap.\" It was about $8. A terrible value. Everything for that matter seemed a bit expensive for lunch.  The waiter never asked how things were going, just kept bringing drinks and quickly disappearing.  Another at the table also did not like what he had -- a steak wrap of some sort. Complained it had no taste, and the dipping sauce that came with it was like a salt-lick. He also asked for a tiny side of ranch dressing -- which they happily charged him $.25 for. It would have been nice if the waiter had mentioned it was going to cost extra.  One other had mac and cheese, which he liked, but it was extremely expensive at $10 (again, lunch), and wasn't a very large serving considering it was pasta (which is cheap to make and cook).  Thankfully, it was clean.   I won't return, and definitely wouldn't recommend it. There are lots of other great places to eat in the Madison area."}
{"text":"I was a frequent customer of this place back when I was an undergrad at UW Madison in the late 1990s. It was great then and it's great now. When in Madison I always make a point to visit, and not just for the warm and fuzzy nostaIgia of my college years.   In my experience, microbrewery/restaurants usually have great beer and mediorcre food, or mediocre beer and great food. The Great Dane has both great beer AND great food. The beer is always superb, with a great selection, and the menu is rather varied for a brewpub. The food is always excellent, and at times has even risen to the level of fine dining. It's a fun, congenial atmosphere, perfect for groups. Great service. All around a wonderful Brew Pub experience."}
{"text":"We sat in the garden out back. Nice escape from the busy streets of the farmers market.  Beer was good. The cheese on the poutine was so flavourful... but between that and the flight we were too full to eat our delicious meals!   Wisconsin mac & cheese and some amazing bacon burger."}
{"text":"Always up for a good pint of Great Dane beer.  However, I haven't been to this location in a couple years.  I was looking forward to trying it again.    Last night, I met a good friend for after-work drinks.  I started with the Black Earth Porter (which is always a personal favorite) at the downstairs bar.  When my friend arrived, we moved upstairs since the space was lacking with the happy hour crowd.  Next drink choice was a brandy old-fashioned sweet, and it was just what I expected.  We finished up the night with pints of Oatmeal Stout.  We had not ordered food but I have eaten at other Great Dane locations around town and hadn't ever been disappointed.   The service was impeccable.  When I had first arrived, despite the downstairs bar being impressively packed for a Tuesday night, I was greeted by the bartender and reassured that she would get my order shortly.  The bartenders were equally attentive when we moved upstairs.    The space is large and accommodating but still has the rich, dark wood that is indicative of that warm pub atmosphere.  This location will always be an option when in the area for a drink or dinner.  I've also heard they have a pretty amazing weekend brunch."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here, and I was a bit disappointed.  I got a \"Wisconsin Mac and Cheese,\" and I might have been a bit optimistic when I ordered it.  I've never really had an above-average Mac and Cheese at a restaurant, and this fit right into that experience.  Last time I was here, I had gotten a a sausage platter that was a bit better.    Service was sort of slow and awkward.  This might have been a fluke, but I wouldn't bet on it.  The beer was on the good side of the normal range, so I have no complaints about that.  I got their red lager, which was satisfying enough for a lunch drink.  I'd like to go again, since I had a better experience last time, and I feel like this might have been a bad combination of choice and timing on my part."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I ate here. But I've drank here many times. I like the basement (rathskellar) and I like the outside patio. And the crowd is a nice mix. I don't feel like a geezer here when I stop in."}
{"text":"I have to disagree with some other reviews and state that i think the food is better than the beer. I guess going to madison in the summer means the town is at least half shut down, but Great Dane was open and busy. Unfortunately, most of the beers we wanted to try, they were out of. And of the ones we did try, the red was more of a light brown, the cream ale was as thin and flavorless as a pilsner, and the wheat wasn't very good either. I love most brewpubs, but this was subpar beer - at least the few they had on tap and weren't out of."}
{"text":"Since I was eating for lunch after drinking lots the night before, the smell of hopps (sp?) was very strong and I knew that I needed to make this lunch quick. The menu has samplers for cheap which was good fro the hair of the dog. The burger was good and many Wisconsin beers to choose from. My friend and I arrived just a few minutes after 11 and this place gets busy quickly. When I came back from the bathroom (which is downstairs) all the tables were filled just before noon. So, get here early. The fact that it was so busy so quickly with so many places to eat in the Capitol tells me that many things are good at this place."}
{"text":"Good location, Good food with big portions.  If that is what you want, then this is your place.  They have a good selection of beer and appetizers as well.  The beer bread and honey butter were good, but the bread seemed a bit dry.   I could have eaten the whole container of butter though... glad I didn't.  I wish I had the self control to not order the burger with a brat patty on top, and bacon on top, on a pretzel bun.   It was delicious on so many levels... but my stomach was angry with me for that."}
{"text":"For a pub, the Dane has some pretty good vegetarian options, clearly marked on their menu.  I enjoy the falafel sandwich and the peanut stew.  The mac and cheese, hot pretzels, and beer bread are also great comfort food options on those Wisconsin winter evenings. The veggie burgers USED to be great, but they've been replaced by Boca patties; the buns have similarly gone downhill from fresh to a more commercial substitute.   My beer-loving friends praise the Dane's beers, but I am not a beer drinker so I can't appreciate it.  The cocktails are mediocre.  I've also heard good things about the Sustain-a-burger (I think that's what it's called), but being vegetarian, I haven't tried it myself.  The desserts are tasty, but I'm usually too full after my meal to have them.  The Dane's patio garden in back is beautiful.  Ask to sit outside if the weather is pleasant."}
{"text":"A classic Madison institution. Food is decent, beer is super here. This is a great place to meet with friends for drinks. If you want a table, especially on the weekend, make a reservation or be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place in Madison! The Great Dane embodies Wisconsin's best (and cheesiest) qualities. It's a perfect balance of American classics with a Wisconsin pub twist. My boyfriend and I have dinner here 2-3 times a month and we are self-proclaimed Dane menu experts. He has a gluten allergy, which typically means he can't have burgers, but The Great Dane offers a delicious gluten-free bun that, half the time, he has to clarify is gluten-free with the server because it tastes so good. The servers are always friendly and happy to help you decide what to order. Their menu is always evolving and they offer amazing seasonal dishes that are unique but not so out there that you worry if you'll like it. There's something for everyone at The Great Dane with a wide variety of options and, of course, an endless list of beer on tap to choose from so you'll always leave feeling like you've had the true Wisconsin experience."}
{"text":"This place has not held up well!!  Worn and tired interior with chipped wood and cheesey bar signs. Typical Wisconsin menu burgers, sandwiches, fish and chips etc. the server, Serena was excellent, hence the three stars.  The food mediocre at best.  Extra charges for extra mayo, salad dressing, flimsy napkins. Might as well be on campus."}
{"text":"Crop Circle Wheat. This beer is to DIE for. If only they sold this commercially, I'd have my fridge stocked at all times.  Their entrees are okay, but they have surprising diversity for a brewpub.  I've tried the Curry Noodle Bowl, Shrimp & Pork Belly Pasta, Dane Burger, cheese curds and poutine. All are pretty solid.  This is a good place for a weekend night out."}
{"text":"impressive food fare for a bar  and the micro-brews were pretty dang yummy  more than anything else, this place is HUGE!  it's like 5 rooms and a huge patio. i've heard it's especially nice at night when you can't see the paint cracking :)"}
{"text":"The Great Dane seems to be one of those places you stumble upon while on vacation and you say to yourself, \"I want something like this place close to my town\".  It is in an older building (Downtown Madison location) and the service was excellent.   First off the beer is really very tasty. My brother in law had the Scottish, I had the Crop Circle Wheat and the specialty Whit (I think it was passion fruit but I can't remember) just get the whit! All the beer was great.   The menu is so very good that I truly believe you could literally close your eyes and point and you would love it. I had the Cuban, I was very happy with the Cuban. My Sister in law had the tandoori chicken and liked it as well.   Fried cheese curds were superb. And pretzel sticks were awesome.   You seriously will not believe this but the show stopper was the mustard that they serve with the pretzels. A coarse ground spicy brown with a kick and a cranberry mustard that you feel like you died and went to heaven. Yes, I said cranberry mustard, and I am not a cranberry fan either!  Go here, don't forget to get a 6-pack to go also!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Beer was great. Food was good. Service was outstanding"}
{"text":"Great beer.  Great food.  Good service.  Beautiful historic building.  What more do you need?  The Great Dane is somewhere I make a habit of going to whenever I'm in Madison.  Last time I was there for five days with my wife we ended up going twice.  The food is quite good.  A simple but excellent treat is the soft pretzels.  I have yet to have a bad meal at the Dane.  The beer is good.  They have many choices that change over time.  If you are a beer fan, they will have something to match your taste.  They even make their own root beer and ginger ale.  Both are amazing."}
{"text":"We had a group of 23 (20 adults, 2 kids, 1 stuffed Grumpy Cat) come in for lunch and it went as well as it possibly could. They were ready for us with a dedicated waitress who was remarkably prompt and accurate for a party that large, and she even split our checks! (Shhh, they're not supposed to do that for large parties.) The Stone of Scone Scottish Ale is so good, I didn't even think about trying their other beers. The selection here is a bit smaller than their other locations, but you'll find something you like. I also like the atmosphere here - it's clean and simple, rustic without being campy, with plenty of wood.  Cheese curds again win my heart. They are very large with thick but crispy, lightly fried batter. Unfortunately, they're $9, which is quite a bit more than anywhere else I tried ($5 is probably par, so this is double bogey).To maximize my cheese intake while in Wisconsin, I grabbed the mac 'n' cheese, which came with a pretzel roll and a wedge of cheddar. The wedge was disappointingly small but I enjoyed the roll and there was plenty of mac to go around. If I was thinking about deducting a star for price, the food quality rounds it right back up."}
{"text":"I have been a longtime fan of Great Dane, the hamburgers and fish tacos are some of my favorites. Always find it to be a great place for lunch, dinner or to just hang out and have some appetizers."}
{"text":"I was angry at the Dane for a long time because their brew pub fare just isn't that good, especially the fries (which I consider nigh unforgivable). For the regular dependables, I honestly think Granite City in the mall delivers better.   The key to the Dane is enjoying the more diverse and/or exciting menu options. Read another way: if there's an analogous dish at Granite City, it's probably better than at the Dane.   Now, there are two big pluses: 1) You can get freaking PLANTAINS with your sandwich. 2) Free refills on house made root beer and cream soda (boy do I have a story about that)."}
{"text":"Well, I went back for the upteenth time--West African peanut stew is still delicious and top-notch. My friend got the fish tacos and the salsa is still burning hot.  Yep, food is still great. Sadly, the beer is still pretty awful. Bland, unexciting, nothing really stands out. I guess the Texas Speedbump is alright, but these guys are just so boring. Stop making my trips a snoozefest when it comes to beer, alright?"}
{"text":"The food here used to be a lot better. They've been going through a kind of McDonaldsfication the past year or so. But this is still probably the best joint in town to just sit back with a freshly brewed beer and eat some used-to-be-good-now-not-great-yet-reasonably-priced barfood.    Fries are often greasy and strangely seasoned, but you can sub mashed potatoes or salad with your sandwich. The salmon BLT is substantial if a little on the fishy side. Their best items are nachos, brats and mash, cheese curds, the pretzel burger (a brat patty on a burger), and beer bread. Some of the food items are really terrible (dry gummy prime rib, the portabella sandwich tastes microwaved, tastes-like-Ragu pasta).  The menu is simply too big and certain dishes need a lot of care, not short-order preparation. But in general, if you can find a spot in the beer garden or a nice booth this is a great place to eat and drink. Keep an eye out for their terrific seasonable barley wine. 1.5 stars for the food, 5 stars for their beer, 5 stars for the beer garden."}
{"text":"(3) A-OK...good for College Kids & Average Pool players;-)lol"}
{"text":"Average in all aspects. Crowded all the time. If you need a place for a 50 person breakfast, it is one of the only options in town. Patio decor is nice. They have some good beer and pools specials on off days."}
{"text":"Great Dane is hard to describe.  It's a brew pub that also serves tandoori chicken!  We really enjoyed the food (fish fry and Thai chicken pasta), and the service was great.  I didn't try the beer, but I would come back just for the food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner. Very good food, good beer also. I like when places have sampler platters for their beer. You could get anywhere from 4 to 10 4 oz beers as a sampler. We had their nachos with beef, a hamburger and the onion soup."}
{"text":"I'm a huge collector of things when I travel. One of the things my BF and I like to do when travelling is to collect pint glasses from various breweries we visit. Although I came to Madison sans BF for a work trip, I found Great Dane Pub and wanted to snag another glass for our modest (but growing!) collection.  My friend and I came here after dinner to grab a few drinks, try the beer, and possibly grab a glass. It all goes downhill from here.  The place was pretty crowded for a weeknight, but we found two seats at the bar. The bartenders here are literally the most blah bartenders I've ever encountered. I think workers at McDonalds are happier. There's quite a bit to choose from on tap, and there's a board showing the name of each beer they have. Since we were kind far away from the board (ugh, my granny eyes couldn't see) I asked the bartender what was on special hoping she'd be able to give us some recommendations. All I got was, \"you can read the board to see what we have\". Um, OK then.  I decided to get a sampler, which was nice because you can choose the amount of beers you try and which ones. I got 4, and honestly, all of them were so blah that none of them were particularly special to me so I don't remember the names of which ones I tried. They were sour and old tasting, and seemed very watered down which is ironic and a little embarrassing if Great Dane brews their own.   The entire ordeal was just so blah and unremarkable to me that I ultimately decided to forego buying a pint glass. It was an experience I'd rather have a momento of."}
{"text":"This updated review is really for when I hosted my finance's birthday on a busy Saturday night with about 20 guests. Kari, the event manager, was always so prompt to respond to my endless e-mails full of questions about what can/can't be done. I have to say that although I acted like a total control freak throughout the planning process, the execution was so smooth that I didn't worry a single thing throughout the night of the event.  First off, the staff was amazing: attentive and friendly, but wasn't in everyone's face. They were great enough to provide us with a separate cake table along with plates, forks, and a knife without me having to ask. Everyone paid for their own meals and appeared satisfied with the food and service. The bartender was also great with serving us along with the rest of the restaurant/bar patrons. Everyone was amazing at their jobs and we were all impressed.  I'm glad I chose this place to host an event. I will definitely consider them again in the future without hesitation."}
{"text":"Great vegan options and tasty beer!  Really, what more could you ask for?  This place will cater to your dietary needs so please don't hesitate to eat here. We split a hummus/pita plate and the inner warmth peanut stew.  We enjoyed every bite of our meal!  Our drinks did not disappoint us either:  Crop Circle Wheat and the IPA.    I was searching for vegan food downtown which was hard to find within walking distance so I started reading menus of nearby restaurants and this place was the winner. Seriously check it out!"}
{"text":"Yummmmm!!!  So delicious! I had the Mac n cheese. My boyfriend had the Texacana burger. For an appetizer we tried the Poutine which was dill cheese curds, fries and gravy. The fries and gravy were exceptional, I wasn't too crazy about the cheese curds. The whole bill came go under $40. Not too bad! One thing I noticed(this is me being picky) was the servers grabbing glasses from the top where my mouth goes instead of the bottom. Again, just me being picky :)"}
{"text":"Awesome place!! Killer brew selection, a ton of fun!!!"}
{"text":"I wish they had one in L.A. I  LOVE this place they have the best cheese curds hand down .. Great Dane has good beer and good food .... It takes comfort food from ALL around the world and slaps it onto one menu ... My favorites are the peanut stew - its AMAZING , the pretzel with that crazy horseradish mustard, their cheese curds (DUH)"}
{"text":"Loved it! We were in town and the hotel recommended this for quality pub food. It was awesome! We had two bloody Mary's and the wings to start. Best wings sauce/ dipping sauce combo ever! Super rich and tasty. Also we had the pub burger with fries and some German sausage plate with mashed potatoes and saurkraut. Both awesome. All this food and two cocktails each set us back under 60 bucks. I couldn't believe it! I'll go back next time I'm in town for sure!"}
{"text":"The beers are generic in flavor and their ferments lack true innovation/creativity  The food menu also lacks imagination, and their execution of their orders are often over sauced, over salted, under served (portion wise), or poorly done in general.  I have eaten here several times and have never been truly satisfied with my experience. I can say though that the service has been great every time! Great staff!"}
{"text":"the beers were excellent - -I brew my own and have high standards for good beer -- the food was awesome - the environment was warm and friendly, my server was really nice and offered samples of many of the unique custom beers available.  I thoroughly enjoyed the craftsmanship and the experience"}
{"text":"Ordered a drink and forgot ( strike one).  Then brought the drink after being asked.  He charged me for the one I reminded him of as well as the one I originally ordered  and was t received(strike two).  Brought me the wrong order for food. (Strike three).  When told of this, he brought me the correct order but gave me the original side order which by that time was cold.     Since he messed up more than his quota, he brought a drink chip.  Too little too late as I won't go back.    The only person catered to was the one picking up the tab.  That is poor P. R., as all should be given proper service."}
{"text":"Loved the food, the beer, and the outdoor patio.    Can't wait to be back to Madison to go for some great beer and a good time at Great Dane!"}
{"text":"This is a classic Madison establishment AND there's Buck Hunter! The bar recently got renovated so it's all jazzed up with lots of tv's for sports. This is a go to place for large groups and chill hang out nights where you just want to play some pool."}
{"text":"Excelent! This is a terrific restaraunt, good food and great service. One of the few open on Thanksgiving. Terrific fried chicken."}
{"text":"Local favorite. A tourist must. A college student's best friend.  Brew pubs tend to be either focus entirely on the \"brew\" (good beer, terrible food, even worse ambience) or on the \"pub\" (mundane/expected beer, amazing atmosphere.) The Great Dane successfully executes all factors necessary for local college students and alcoholics to call it home, including a killer patio, a traditional rathskeller, and beers to drive from Milwaukee to taste.   Tri pepper beer? Yes, please. Abrikoos, a peachy, girly brew? I'll have 3. The stout is very tasty as well as the healthiest beer according to Men's Health Sept 2010 (thanks to my boyfriend and his roommate for being inefficient and each having a subscription. )  See you next happy hour, you frisky puppy."}
{"text":"With the previous working experience in one of the restaurants one can say that I may be a bit bias. But, there is a certain sense of community in all of the Great Danes I have gone to. Though I have only seen three they seem to set a good basis and each offer something unique. The menu is wonderful and old fashioned along with the home brews that are ever so present. For whatever occasion, the restaurant can tailor and provide a wonderful space."}
{"text":"Sucks- waitress had attitude, Manager the same. Been coming 3+ yrs, made me feel stupid. Mgr Megan rocks, service today made me not want to come back- so poor."}
{"text":"We've been going to the Great Dane for years. We enjoy their food, but we encountered a hostess today that really made our experience unpleasant. We went specifically to dine in the outside garden. When we got there about half the tables were occupied. Some of the vacant tables were in the direct sun, some were either in the shade or had umbrellas. She wanted to seat us in the direct sun, and when we requested shade, she told us that because there were only two of us, those tables weren't availabe (despite at least one deuce being in the shade). She went back and studied her seating chart for awhile, like she was really being inconvenienced, and finally sat us at a table that was only partially in the sun. The food was good, our server was excellent, but when you begin the experience being told that you're not really valued because there are only two of you, it really detracts! (BTW, the vacant tables stayed vacant the entire time we were there.)"}
{"text":"Am in Madison for one night and went to the Great Dane before a wedding reception. Was great to get to try some of the local beer, but it would have been great if it wasn't brewery specific. A variety of local brews would have been good to have as well."}
{"text":"This is definitely a place that puts its makeup on and is totally presentable to mom, but underneath she's kind of just OK. The menu is fairly large and will have something for every kind of picky eater except the one that wants really good food or drinks. It's all kind of expensive, too.  The best part about the Dane is the location and the games. It's really a good place to hang out - something that downtown just doesn't have. Playing pool or darts or shuffleboard is really nice when you've finished every last episode of The League."}
{"text":"Fun! Packed bar. Very good cherry ale. We only drank, but will go back to eat soon."}
{"text":"The Dane is a regular brunch or dinner place for us. Especially in the summer. We love that we never have to wait to be seated and the food is always the same reliable standard! I only recently tried the curried mussels and loved it! And my three year old son just sits down and asks for his Mac and cheese because he's obsessed with it. His dad follows suit half the time. Burgers are fantastic. Peanut stew is my go-to on rainy/gloomy/cold days."}
{"text":"Not a fan of their beer, and they don't have other options. Large and sterile. Menu is big, but not that exciting.  Food is average. Place for college kids and young professionals to drink heavily.  Food take 30 minutes from ordering. I am only here because others invite large groups, and am always surprised how they stick around."}
{"text":"Good bar food and micro brew beer. I had a brown ale and the catfish sandwich both were delightful. Nice building."}
{"text":"When in Madison you have to go to the Great Dane, right?  The beer is great.  My Stone of Scone Scotch Ale was a winner.  The Dane burger was OK.  The artichoke dip on it was interesting.  If the weather is nice, try to get a seat on the outside back patio downstairs."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I HAVE to stop in whenever I pass through Madison.  I've tried their other locations, but only the original downtown spot is worth the stop.  The other locations in strip malls seems to suck the soul out of the experience.  For me, the beauty of this place is that everything I have tried just pops with flavor.  They truly have built a menu of foods designed to eat with beer.  And the beer!  I love it that the brews are all unique and different (too many brew pubs use the same hops blend for every style...Booo!) and all of them represent an outstanding version of the particular style.  I'm particular fond of the scotch ale."}
{"text":"Good food, not for a soft talker.  The Dane's food is great.  An excellent Ruben is to be had and I really liked their take on fish & chips.  Expect a wait if there's any sort of event going on in town or arrive early."}
{"text":"Optimistically went here for midafternoon Thanksgiving buffet, no reservations. They gave us the option of sitting at high-tops in the upstairs bar, which turned out to be ideal...we were seated, served drinks and loaded up on first plates before the reservation crowd got seated. EXCELLENT food, attentive, friendly staff (despite the overflow crowd) ,pleasant surroundings wide variety of delicious food. And they do Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!  The poutine was absolutely delicious.  The beer was tasty and the service was extra friendly.  Raquel our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and super friendly."}
{"text":"Oh My Word!!!! Get the cheese curds. Phenomenal! Ordered a beer at the bar and the bar tender was great to explain what the Crop Circle Wheat was. Brewed by Great Dane, I was. Very happy. Visit this place, great service, beer is cold, cheese curds are hot, the meat loaf was  A-maz-ing."}
{"text":"The menu for this place is fantastic. You can get everything from a delicious wrap to a full dinner. If you are a health conscious person, this restaurant offers side options at no additional charge which include fresh cut dipping vegetables.   It offers a delicious variety of food. I have been there three times, each time getting something different.   My first time, I thought I would play it safe with a burger. Delicious, well cooked and overall a filling meal. I had it with the hot applesauce. I assumed this would be like traditional applesauce but it was a warm cup of apple cooked in cinnamon. This was almost like a pie filling. Delicious but slightly out of place for dinner.   My second time I had the chicken salad on croissant with the dipping vegetables. The chicken salad had nice chunks of chicken and it was not watery. The one thing I can not stand is when my bread gets soggy from the chicken. My veggies included broccoli, celery, carrots and cucumbers.   My most recent visit, I had the pulled pork sandwich with couscous. The couscous was delicious, typical but delicious, However the sandwich was amazing. Absolutely delicious. There are so words to describe the flavor and tenderness, so I will leave it at: Just try it. Seriously.   The only thing that keeps me from giving this a \"5\" is the fact that they let loud uncontrollable children in the restaurant. I understand this is a family restaurant, but 2 of the 3 times I have been to the Great Dane, I have sat out in the patio. Each time, we have gotten one of the last available tables. We have been seated next to families with demanding children or just overall children who scream through their entire meal.   I do not dislike children, but if I wanted it to sound like a Chuck E. Cheese, I would go there. I go to the patio to have a good meal and drink a beer with my fiance. (PS Their beer is fantastic) I do not go to listen to someone threaten little Bobby that if he does not eat his vegetables he will get it when they get home.   My service and experience has not been up to par because of this. I mentioned this to the server and she did nothing. The one time I sat inside, we were seated nowhere near children and were provided the best service to date.   I wish this restaurant took the ambiance of the entire restaurant under consideration when they allow disruptions like that to continue on. After all, if it was a drunk adult, they would be asked to leave."}
{"text":"I learned pretty quickly this was a hot-spot in Madison. With multiple locations (in a four-day visit, I went to two of them)- the menu, both beer and food, will keep you coming back to try more. The food definitely didn't disappoint- and ANYTHING you might be craving, or forgot you were craving, will be on this menu. The portions are huge- but you find yourself finishing every bite. If you are going to Madison for a visit or even just driving through- I recommend this spot to get a little taste of Madison's food, beer, and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Great vibe, great decor, great location near Wisconsin State Capitol.  Excellent service by Megan.  Cheesecake dessert with raspberry sauce, served in a cup, was one of the tastiest desserts I've ever had. Perfect size for me: big enough to be satisfying; small enough that I don't need to feel guilty.  Also enjoyed the vegan stew with rice. Loved the sweet cranberry mustard served with the  hot pretzel; preferred it to the more traditional mustard both Great Dane and other restaurants offer with their hot pretzel."}
{"text":"We had just driven into Madison from Chicago, and we were starving!  Upon suggestion from a college friend of mine, we went here for dinner.  All of us were extremely excited to be in a state where cheese is an abundant ingredient, so we ordered the mac and cheese to start.  It was yummy, and perfect for sharing before our meal.  My sisters and I all got burgers and fries, which were standard -- good.  Mom got the po boy sandwich, which also tasted good, however could have used more sauce?  or something?  The sandwich was on the dry side.  But, for her side, she got fried plantains...exciting!!  They were really good (we all stole a bite).  I also had a german style beer, upon recommendation by our server, which I also enjoyed.   Even though the food was nothing to write home about, it was good, hit the spot, and the service was timely and very friendly.  This place looks like a fun happy hour spot.  I wish there was one in Chicago, because I would be going!"}
{"text":"Whenever I have someone visiting Wisconsin I have to take them to the Great Dane to check out what a Madison brew pub is like. Great menu and great execution. Their beer is also much better and smoother than most micro brews. Try their Sunday brunch. It's pricy but has more choices than most."}

{"text":"We went for the limited late night menu and I liked it! Service was good! We had a really nice waitress who was prompt and attentive. We were there at about 10:30 on a Sunday night and it wasn't busy. No Sunday drink specials.  The blackberry summer cocktail was really good! Refreshing and very seasonally appropriate.  The nachos were good but could have used more chips! The Mac and cheese was Wisconsin cheesy!!  Bathroom downstairs is really nice. There was live music downstairs on a Sunday, but may have been for a private event."}
{"text":"The Great Dane is a small chain brewery and restaurant. It is a few cuts above the rest of the standard bars with food. With pretzels that will make you melt and dips that will make you burn, I was sold immediately. Unlike many restaurants, tey clearly state what is vegetarian, I highly appreciated that.   My Mac and cheese was so creamy and tasty. It was the best one I had during my many visits to The cheese capital of the US (yes, happy cows come from Cali, but still). My portobello burger was juicy too! I'm not sure but I think you can't go wrong here. I have been to other bars with with good food, but somehow they perfected the bar foods. Great service and consistently good food. However, they are more a restaurant than a bar. I was surprised when the beers were just ok, I don't get too much satisfaction out of them."}
{"text":"Love this place, it is so adorable with the outdoor patio. But the Dane Burger - not sure what to think about it. Burger is fantastic on its own but then they add artichoke dip to it? two things I love that should be a perfect match, but it was just meh. Probably just a mismatch in ordering on my part. Service was top notch."}
{"text":"Great beer, great atmosphere, and great food.  The smothered chicken was amazing.  Also had the peanut stew which was very good as well.  A must hit on every visit to Madison."}
{"text":"We are regulars at the Dane. Their craft beers are wonderful and their food is almost always solid. We have had a few misses, cold food, and their funny tasting artichoke dip. However, some of my favorites are the hummus plate- SO MUCH DELICIOUSNESS- decent fish fry, good burgers, and yummy burritos. Service is almost always good, statistically your bound to have a few less stellar experiences. We have never had anything bad here. It's our solid go to to a quick night out or a game day."}
{"text":"I had forgotten I reviewed this place almost 5 years ago, but I had an unfortunate experience here last week.  I stopped in on Monday night, as I was meeting with a friend who was in town.    I ordered the inner warmth peanut stew.  I've had peanut stew before, and this didn't taste anything like it at all.  There was no peanut.  It tasted like a tomato base, and nothing else.  I also ordered an IPA that came out too warm.  I get that ales should be served warmer than lagers, but this was too warm.  Would have asked our server, but she was nowhere to be found."}
{"text":"I like this Great Dane's bar a lot more than the one downtown.  It's classy looking and spacious.  It doesn't tend to get overcrowded with tons of college students or Badger game-goin' sports fans, either.  I can get my coveted Great Dane beers just a few minutes from my house.  All of that is wonderful.  I am not very fond of the restaurant part of this location.  It reminds me a little bit of a hotel restaurant or something.  Plus, if you're seated near the window, you see....the grand, sweeping parking lot.  Sexy.  The food is still good, of course, but the overall ambiance leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"I had such a great time here! We were a party of 8 and they sat us almost immediately for sunday brunch. They have a huge all you can eat, self service, brunch buffet that does not lack in quality. It included such food items as: mashed potatoes, shrimp, waffles, bacon, sausage links, fresh fruit, a carvery, salad, cakes, pancakes, and much more. They were also serving their late night pub menu which we ordered a few apps and burgers off of. Their cheese curds were tasty but were not really cheese curds, they were more of mozzarella sticks in the shape of balls. The burgers were tasty and came with some cool toppings but I thought the bun could have been more dense and flavorful. The two best parts of this establishment for me was the games (I played billiards and shuffle board) and the service. Juliette was my server and she was absolutely amazing. She is incredibly sweet and made sure we had everything we needed to fully enjoy our dining experience. She even split up our bill for us which I know is a pain to do especially for a large party."}
{"text":"The Great Dane was our first and last meal during our weekend in Wisconsin, and unfortunately, both times weren't that great.   - Sunday Brunch (10am - 2:30pm): buffet with over 50 items - Happy Hour (Monday - Friday, 4pm - 6pm): $3 12oz glasses, $4 20oz pints, $10 pitchers, and $3.50 well drinks  - Old Glory Cheese Curds ($9.25): good cheese curds, but nothing mind blowing - Poutine ($6.75): fries were underseasoned, and there wasn't that much gravy - The Great Dane Pub Wings ($6.25): typical wings - Gulf Shrimp and Pork Belly Pasta ($16): way too oversauced, but the egg was a nice addition to the pasta  They also have flights from 4 sampler glasses ($6.50) to 10 sampler glasses ($15.50).   Not bad for pub food, but The Great Dane isn't a restaurant I'd be missing or craving! But since the restaurant is huge and their menu is extensive, The Great Dane is a good option if you have a big group."}
{"text":"Stopped here to have a few beers and watch football. Great selection of beers, coffee is ok, kind of expensive altogether but a fun place to hang and watch the game."}
{"text":"My sister in law had her rehearsal dinner here at The Great Dane. They set up a fixed menu since she was having such a large party. My husband and I both got the burger and it was fantastic. They quickly and efficiently served our entire party. We originally planned to sit outside, but after a rainy morning they offered to move our entire party inside.  Be sure to play shuffle board and other fun games when visiting this location. It's a great place with delicious food, drink and good company."}
{"text":"We ate here 3 nights in a row, we were staying across the street at the Wyndham and this place had a nice enough variety to try something different every night. The first 2 nights we took it to-go and we've had bad experiences with doing that but not with this place. I had the quesadilla and my hubby had the jerk tacos and we both enjoyed it. They gave us huge portions, so much so that neither of us could finish our meal. The 2nd night I had the macaroni and I forgot what he had but I loved it. 3rd night, we ate in the restaurant and  I had the tortellini and he had the cuban. Once again, we couldn't finish the portions we were given and it was so very tasty. The hubby really enjoyed the fries as well. Friendly waitress. Nice atmosphere. Cool spot."}
{"text":"I raise them one star for their stance on the micro beer issue.   People are starting to wake up that we have the power to fight back and fight we will.  Great Dane is doing the absolute right thing.  Thank you Great Dane!"}
{"text":"Wound up here for a hockey tournament team dinner and was a bit disappointed.  The group was banished to the basement of the Great Dane and the restaurant/bar only assigned one server to the group of about 50 people including children under the age of 12.  The food was all right yet my caribbean jerk tacos where not exactly what I expected.  Quite heavy on the pineapple flavor and very minimal on the cilantro and other spicy jerk flavors.  The bigger problem was the fact that the server assigned to our very large group started taking the orders of the parents versus starting with the two kids tables that the restaurant created.  The parents were all served easily and the children all waited (fortunately very patiently) for their food.  The whole time our group was there it just seemed to me that our group was pretty much an after thought versus a group that was there to spend money on both food and beverage.  Maybe The Great Dane is a decent restaurant when you're not with a large group however, I am not sure that I would be willing to give The Great Dane a second chance.  We came here based on the recommendation of some University of Wisconsin alumni yet I was somewhat disappointed by the entire experience.    When the people that inform the restaurant of a large group they are bring in and how to best handle the ordering process when the group prefers separate bills please listen to the advise being provided and make sure that you understand that a majority of the group is children and their parents with the children being 12 years of age or younger."}
{"text":"Great place, great atmosphere and very friendly staff. We stopped in here for a beer and a snack and were not disappointed. The Crop Circle Wheat beer is in the top three of wheat / hefeweizens I have ever had, it was a great beer. We also had the pretzel with cheese and it was excellent. The staff also let us try A new bourbon that was out and it was really smooth. Great place to get a beer and a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Good food and greats beers on tap. A pint was only $5.50 of any of the micro-brews offered. I tried Emerald Isle stout, which was a nitro pour. It was really good, tasted like coffee! I also had the Mediterranean plate appetizer as dinner, and it was plenty for me.  My friends got a variety of other items which they all said were delicious. The food was typical pub-grub kind of stuff with a comfort/soul food flair. They even had shrimp and grits on special. The bar area was nice and had plenty of room to congregate and watch the Packers game."}
{"text":"I find myself missing the Great Dane since I transplanted to Milwaukee post-college. However, I've found that it doesn't top my list when I go visit Madtown. Part of the reason it doesn't make the to-do list is because their beers lie in the \"OK\" range. I appreciate that they brew so many beers...some are not that great. Being a beer snob, I gravitate towards other places when I am visiting.  Still, their food remains delicious. I usually get the fish fry with slaw and fries with malt vinegar."}
{"text":"I cannot speak for the food or for the drinks, I have been here many times and only come for one reason...  Pool table rental by the hour, one of the few places in the downtown area of Madison you will find that."}
{"text":"Some friends of ours brought us here for the first time, and we really enjoyed ourselves! We have a toddler, so the efficient and friendly hostess directed us outside to a private and comfortable patio. As promised, a server came out eventually to take our order, and took excellent care of us ode several hours.  We ordered a full flight of beers, and our friends each got a pint of their favorite. While there is a huge range and variety of beer styles served up here, we enjoyed the IPAs the most. All were solid brews- Great Dane definitely knows their stuff and has something to please everyone. The great outdoor atmosphere mixed with solid, experienced service made it a great experience for all of us.   For a nice place to hang in Madison, we would definitely recommend it here."}
{"text":"I went here several times mainly to watch sport games and get a beer or cocktail. The food is okay honestly. I did not like the fish fry because to me it wasn't authentic and I have had better fish fry in a local bar. If you are new to Wisconsin or the Midwest and you have never had fish fry before, definitely don't try your first here. The fish wasn't fresh and it was too dried. Anyhow, it is a good place for hanging out, watching games and enjoying beer"}
{"text":"Awesome place to come late night for drinks.  There is a great patio outside with lots of space and pretty trees covering it.    I ordered the mac and cheese which was pretty good, rigatoni with Wisconsin cheddar and a beery Pilsner taste, served with a soft pretzel bun, and some drinks."}
{"text":"Some of the best beer I've ever had!  The service was super great (our waitress was very friendly & knew a lot about the beer & let us taste samples).  Was a perfect start to my first trip to Madison."}
{"text":"We were in from out of town and my wife and I decided on it our first night out.  Great beer sampler, some very good, some ok.  We tried 8 and enjoyed most.  The food was excellent.  Nachos were as good as they get with multi-colored chips, guacamole, jalapenos and some great spicy sauce.  We stayed for a second night and decided to bring our teenage kids who also loved it.  The first night we were inside and the second we ate in the outdoor patio.  Service was good and we had some salads and sandwiches which were also very good.  Good atmosphere, good beer, good food.  A couple great nights out for the family or adults."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the great dane.  Every time my husband and I ate in Madison we go.  Usually we end up in the one in Fitchburg, but this time we went to the one downtown near the captial.  I ordered my usual favorites, since we hadn't been there in a while.  The cheese cruds are some of the best, and the jalapeno dip was awesome.  I'm fairly picky with my burgersand I got the the one I wanted with the requests I asked for.  We did have a bit of a wait after we were seated til a waiter came, but they could have just been busy.  Any Great Dane is a good one and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to have a meal  here both before & after the Great Taste of the Midwest beer fest as they were awesome enough to offer a free shuttle to & from the fest.   We had the Cuban & turkey club which were both really good.  The French fries were crispy & tasty.  The second meal was a burger & Mac n cheese.  Both were good but we liked our first 2 choices best. We didn't have a beer this time b/c of all the beer we drank at the fest. Next time in the area we will be sure to stop by for both food & drink."}
{"text":"GD is chain similar to a Rock Bottom or BJs. Three stars for a chain is good. They brew OK beer and serve food common to pubs. The only reason we came here instead of one of the better, original places on the square is because we had too many people in our party to think we could get a table together at a better place. GD came through with an immediate table, service, beer and food.... all at adequate quality."}
{"text":"BIG fan of The Dane. All of the beers are great, but my favorite is the Devil's Lake Red. Great selection of flavors and styles for a pretty reasonable price...and shuffleboard, which is awesome. My one gripe would be that not all of the beer styles are available at every location, but there's enough variety that you can get over it pretty easily."}
{"text":"Wow...the bartender was awesome!  He was very helpful with their in-house beers and providing us with a late night menu.  They will give you some samples of their beers to find the one for you.  Both of the beers I had were great.  I had an APA and my wife had something slightly sweet which was better than the APA.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger off of the late night menu with sweet potato fries.  The late night menu may lack size, but that as made up in quality and taste.  I really liked their burger and fries.    Great beer, delicious food, and stellar service."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last night and was unimpressed with the service. Our waiter never came back to our table to check on us, see if we needed any refills on our drinks or ask if we would like dessert (assuming they have dessert.) Instead, he came back and left the bill on the table. I had the mac & cheese, which was good, but not worth returning for such poor service. The restaurant wasn't busy enough to account for it either. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Above average bar food and decent atmosphere.  Not a drinker so can't say I'd make this a return destination but wouldn't rule it out with a group."}
{"text":"This will always be my first love in Madison. The food is always very good, and I love that they have some more exotic and veggie-friendly options.  Craft beers are great here. The Rathskellar is my fav place to eat in the colder months, but as soon as it warms up, the hidden outdoor patio in the back is like a mini vacation. I've come here with large and small groups, and never been disappointed.  I also love checking out the game in the lower bar, and there's a lot of pool tables to enjoy.  I take all my out-of-town pals here first--it's the best place to whet their palates for a weekend of great food and drink in a city that has no shortage of it."}
{"text":"We are new to Madison and decided to try Great Dane as part of our welcome to Wisconsin tour. I'm glad we tried it once, though I'm not sure it will be on our go-to list.  The service was great- from the host to the servers. Our server knew a lot about the beers and the food, which I always appreciate. We sat outside in the garden (it was way too hot, I don't know what we were thinking...).   The cheese curds were OK. We had cheese curds from the Old Fashioned earlier in the week, so the bar was set pretty high.  We did a beer sampler (4 beers for $6). I won't pretend to be a beer expert - but none of the beers really stood out. We tried a pale ale, the crop circle wheat, a red ale, and a scotch ale. All fine. Nothing blew me away.   The place seems really popular. I'm sure it's just a matter of finding the beer and menu items that fit you. I will probably try it again."}
{"text":"The Great Dane is where I take visitors. It's menu is huge, so everyone can find something they want, the beer is good, and I've never been dissatisfied with the food. I'm addicted to their fish fry, which has a great breading (and the accompanying tartar sauce is delicious too!). My dad loves their wings. The Great Dane is a reliable option that has yet to disappoint."}
{"text":"Personally, I like the food at the Great Dane much better than at the Old Fashioned."}
{"text":"Cheese curds were good but don't eat too much because you'll have a tummy ache afterwards. Great Dane pub wings was ok, there wasn't anything special about it. Buffalo Mac and Cheese was way too cheesy. Overall, food was ok but staff was friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Tried the Great Dane on a whim, was not disappointed. They've got a nice selection of beers (which, if I understand correctly, are all brewed in-house) and I had the Stout. Good beer.   Had the brat & pretzel burger with fries. Enjoyed said burger greatly.  Service was good, attentive without being overbearing. Only thing that was unusual (to me) is they wanted a credit card up front to run a tab for a beer and sandwich. Not sure if that's a regular thing for this area or not, so it's not factored into my review, just mentioned.  Nice ambiance.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Great Dane is a Madison staple, with good reason. With a respectable selection of beers made exclusively by them, you know you'll get something special. Perhaps my favorite thing about all Great Dane locations is the ample room to spread out and hang out with friends. They all have a lot of space and people are always having a good time there - playing shuffle board is popular."}
{"text":"Ate here the last night of our stay in Madison, WI during the CrossFit Games.  Overall good atmosphere with good lighting. We didn't try any of the beers and were really there for the food. Wings were EXCELLENT with a good crunch. I had a burger that was good but not memorable. My boyfriend said the same thing. Overall, we left satisfied at a good price. Service was fast, but the waiters walked around the old wooden floors with heavy feet, which gave a hurried vibe.  Good food, fast service, nothing crazy."}
{"text":"I think I go here every time I visit the Madison area. Heck, I even went there twice on my most recent visit.  This place has great beer, good food and is a good deal. I took my girl friends out for a night and we got a round of drinks, two appetizers and entrees for under $75 for the 5 of us.   It's a good place for a crowd, but if it's a substantial group, go early or call ahead."}
{"text":"This is my least favorite bar on Badger days.  On all other days it's surprisingly fun and an excellent spot to please all tastes.  Excellent beer, above average bar food, a big wood bar, and by far the best beer garden.   I'm going to try the fish fry some time because Jeremy Kraft really likes it."}
{"text":"It was our first stop once we got into town on Friday! We started off with the pretzel, and it was delish! They had a great beer selection and the prices were very reasonable! For my main, I got half of a wrap and a bowl of soup and it was A LOT of food. My fiance got the grilled cheese, and it was very tasty. Not your typical grilled cheese. I would definitely recommend checking them out. We were sat quickly during the lunch hour, but we noticed as we walked past on our way to dinner they were packed!"}
{"text":"So the food's not bad -- their cheese curds are awesome, which is a big plus in my book! They have so many yummy looking menu options (vegetarian, too!!), it's hard to make any decisions on food! Everything from brats to falafels to peanut stew. You can't beat the beer, of course, but they had none of the seasonal brews listed on the menu. And the location rocks.. the old Fess Hotel off the square (old timers and natives will remember the old landmark). What did not make me happy on my first homecoming to Madtown in at least 6 years.. super cute boyfriend in tow? We were a group of 5 on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, and the place was not crazy -- yet they sat us downstairs in the basement in the furthest corner next to the loud party-table of lawyers having some kind of award ceremony for themselves. Not cool when I wanted to be able to talk to my family and impress the boyfriend. The table was filthy, which is just gross! The waitress was awkward and slow, though this can be chalked up to a newbie... and the party-table of lawyers, probably. At least we were conveniently next to the bathroom.. right? I was disappointed."}
{"text":"The Great Dane is definitely a local institution. As a result, its major downside is that at night it is terribly crowded. The food, yeah, I can take it or leave it. However, Great Dane's beers are terrific, so I find it a worthwhile place to go in spite of the crowds. There are many regular beers brewed all of the time, as well as several seasonal beers. It's always fun to try a different type every time."}
{"text":"Average food.  Cheese curds were like an archaeological dig through the breading to find the cheese.  I guess bread is cheap and cheese is expensive, but cheese curds are supposed to be all about the cheese!  Prices are a little on the high side.  House brewed beer was nothing special.  I do not understand why people love this place so much."}
{"text":"Walked over to Great Dane after moving our daughter into UW. It was a beautiful night so we dined outside. The outdoor area is a hidden gem behind the restaurant. The food was great as was the service. We ate at another location and had a fantastic Easter Brunch. This is a great go-to restaurant when you're looking for a great meal and a pleasant, fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"My gf and I stopped by the Great Dane on Saturday around 4.  We waited about 10 -15 minutes after getting seated and I had to alert the hostess that we hadn't seen our waitress (- 1 star).  I tried the Emerald Isle Stout and Black Earth Porter.  Both were very smooth but I thought the stout had more flavor so I opted for a pint.  Very good.  We had the pretzels (3 pieces) for an appetizer.  Not much to say about pretzels but watch out for the yellow mustard.  It is loaded with horse radish so it has a delayed kick to it.  Good, but a little goes a long way.  The other red mustard had a berry flavor to it and was a good compliment to the yellow mustard.  My gf had the black and tan cheddar burger and although messy to eat, was ok.  I had the meatloaf and while the meatloaf was ok, the mashed potatoes tasted like they were left over from the day before.  I liked the stout so much I picked up a growler to go (1/2 gallon).  Overall I'd say the Great Dane is worth a try if you are in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit."}
{"text":"I was in town from St. Louis. My friend brought me here knowing what a beer fan I am. I had the Brats, they were fantastic. It came with mashed potatoes and some cinnamon apples, they were equally as fantastic.   And since they are a brewery I had to have some beers as well. Excellent!!! If I lived in Madison I would be a regular here as much as I am Schlafly in St. Louis."}
{"text":"Great great place!  The most underrated part of this place is the garden in back, which is not open too often other than in the summertime.  When we eat here, I usually will get the shrimp po' boy, and follow it up with a few Great Dane Scotch Ales, my favorite Madison beer besides Capital Winter Skal."}
{"text":"We dined at The Great Dane on a busy Friday night with a group of 10 people which included our friend who is confined to a wheelchair.  We chose Great Dane because we knew the restaurant is accessible, which in our friend's case means no stairs, enough room to maneuver his wheelchair through the dining room and wide entry doors.  He had no accessibility issues with the restaurant.  Next, the staff was awesome tonight!  Not only to our friend, but they accommodated the fact we didn't know how big our group would be and it was no issue for us to take up a table and just have drinks while waiting for the rest of our group to arrive.  We run into too many situations at other restaurants where we must wait for the entire party to arrive until they will seat us.  We appreciated the flexibility they gave us in that regard.  Everyone in our group seemed to enjoy their entrees.  Since this was a Friday night, I gave their fried perch a try, and while certainly tasty, it was a very small portion especially for the price.  It consisted of 3 smallish fish filets and a small portion of fries and cole slaw.  This probably met my personal caloric requirement for this meal, but a big guy or a teenager would have walked away hungry from that meal.  Other meals on the table seemed to be of a more reasonable size.  Food came out very quickly once our entire group was there and we were able to order.  The small portion certainly won't prevent me from going back, I may just have to choose something different depending on my appetite."}
{"text":"I have been to the Great Dane many times for drinks and many times for lunch but never for brunch. I would have to say the food was pretty average.  Started out with a Bloody Mary and asked for it spicy. It was very good.  For food, I got the North Star breakfast with bacon and scrambled eggs. The homemade biscuit was awesome. The bacon and homefries (although small portion) were also both good.  My girlfriend got the eggs Benedict which I tried and the hollandaise sauce was bland.   Now we didn't get the most extravagant brunch options on the menu, and they were good, But I expected better because I love a lot of their other lunch/dinner options."}
{"text":"I debated between a three or four-star review, but when thinking about if I would be a regular if I lived in Madison, I had to go with three. It's not because of anything specific, just think there is way better beer and ambiance a elsewhere.   The bartender was super friendly and helpful, made great recommendations, and was willing to keep my water filled for the entire time I sat at the bar reading a book. In addition, he was more than happy to offer my plenty of samples while I decided which beer I wanted. He was that perfect balance of chatty and quiet that is hard to master. But the best bartender in the world doesn't help if the beer is just mediocre.  The food and ambiance were both decent. He recommended the special of the day, a meatball sub, which had delicious meatballs but wasn't as good as it could have been. The ranch dressing for the veggies is very thin and watery, so I was definitely glad it wasn't on a salad.   It also just seems kind of weird (though I know it's not their fault), that a place named after a dog doesn't allow dogs on their patio.   In other words, I wouldn't actively avoid going to Great Dane, but I might not seek  it out either."}
{"text":"Great Dane is a great place to gather with friends for some decent beer and amazing apps. The decor is open and promotes groups using the space, and the service is typically pretty fantastic. Their only downfall is that the menu is a bit hit or miss. The WISCONSIN Mac and cheese is great, the burgers were surprisingly average. They also have a DJ on Friday nights, which is awesome if you want to find a \"club\" experience in Fitchburg, but rather annoying if you are just trying to have drinks with friends. Overall decent, but there's probably better places in Madison."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, easy street parking, no problem being seated quickly.   I had the West African chicken peanut stew. It was lovely; homemade and full of large cut, fresh veggies.   The rest of the meal- ewwwww. Dudes, please change the fryer oil.   Cheese curds because it's Wisconsin. Half of them had no cheese, and the batter was bland and full of old oil and raw flour flavor. The dipping sauce was okay even if it is bizarre to have Hatch chili in Wisconsin.   The fish and chips. Super thick, flavorless batter over mild haddock- way too much for the delicate fish. The house made malt vinegar was odd and contained Worcestershire. What? Yes, seriously. The chips (fries), well, we were looking for the Sysco truck when we left. The house made coleslaw was fine, but with a tiny two ounce ramekin sized serving who can really say?   Thanks but no thanks. There are too many wonderful restaurant choices in Madison to ever eat here again."}
{"text":"Bad ass. Full bar & kitchen upstairs. Another full bar downstairs, and a beautiful beer garden.   Good beer, good food, cool staff, good crowd, you really can't go wrong.   $10 for a pack of smokes from the bar. Ha! You shouldn't be smoking anyway, you naughty person, you.  $9 for cheese curds. Yumm-o."}
{"text":"I've been to this location more times than I can count. I've sat at the bar, sat in the bar area, dined in the dining area both downstairs and upstairs. It is a large building that can get fairly noisy depending on the time of day.   The menu doesn't change that often because the food is good. They have everything from shareables, soup/sandwich combos, comfort food, and traditional bar burgers. Some of our favorites are the meatloaf, chicken pot pie, mac n cheese, and their fish. But to be honest you really can't go wrong with anything you order off their menu.   I would say 90% of the time the service is on point. There has been a few times while sitting at the bar, service has been slow. It seemed like a few bartenders focused on other people more than us.   Another reason why I love the Great Dane is for their beer. They have a decent variety of their own brews. Did you know you can get freshly tapped growlers or crowlers (a 32oz can) to go? Yeah its pretty amazing!"}
{"text":"Somehow this place gets worse, not better.  The food is institutional.  The beer is syrupy.  Survives on its laurels."}
{"text":"Excellent choice of craft beers. Always very good pub grub. These restaurants gained a reputation of offering good service and food and have expanded with more locations."}
{"text":"I visited my son and his girlfriend in Madison and he took us to The Great Dane and we had a blast. Nice crowd, nice beer very nice atmosphere. We played pool until almost 2am and the crowd was still nice. Is a place to visit in my next trip to Madison."}
{"text":"Best patio dining experience I have ever had.  Food delicious, atmosphere superb."}
{"text":"I don't consume alcohol, so this is a strange place for me to go to but the people I was with consume alcohol. This is a review for just the food.  The ribs are just ok but a little dry. The sauce is too heavy and overbearing. I can make better ribs.  The wings appetizer was better. The wings are juicy and the sauces - Chinese and jerk - are very good.  The fried cheese appetizer is pretty good but let's be frank - a blindfolded monkey can't screw up fried cheese.  If you like pubs and micro brews, this place may be for you."}
{"text":"If I was a beer drinker, this place would have five stars.  I love going to the Great Dane. Fun atmosphere(if a bit loud) and fantastic food. I haven't had a dissapointing meal here EVER. The waitstaff is friendly and know their stuff.  Great Fish Fry, delicious sandwiches(and fish tacos!), and desserts to drool over(two-spooners)."}
{"text":"I moved to Madison in October and have been to the Great Dane about 7 times since. I try to eat something new every visit (doesn't always happen that way) but I have never had a bad meal. I am also a huge fan of their Old Glory APA. Good beer, good food, helpful staff!"}
{"text":"Great beers, even better food! Came here from Chicago with a few friends and we had a great time. Cheese curds were out of this world!  *TIP!* Love their beers? Don't want to buy a full blown Growler? Get a \"Crawler\". You can get their beer canned for only $7! Definitely took a few of them with us home back to Chicago :) Will be back next time I'm around."}
{"text":"I am a beer fan.  The dog bone sampler of all the beers is great to bring friends who are visiting Madison to give them a good experience.  It's very open and has a lot of space.   All the food I've had there is fantastic and some are healthy too!"}
{"text":"When I think of Madison I think of this place. The beer is great, the food is diverse and extremely we'll made and the building is beautiful. I've heard raves about the African peanut soup(or whatever) but I opted for the brats and cheese curds."}
{"text":"Simply put, you won't find a bar that has as wide and tasty a selection of custom micro brews in all of Madison - capital of American Beer country.  This place is unique.  With a partially rotating seasonal menu, it has some unique offerings along with its exceptional beer offering.  Whether it's a meal or a night hanging with friends to catch a game, The Great Dane is a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Food: I came here right after running the Madison Marathon for my traditional post race burger and some good beer. I sat at the bar and started off with a Texas Speedbump IPA. For my burger, I ordered the Applewood Bacon Burger with sharp Cheddar and a side of mashed potatoes. It came out with fries, so they brought me some mash potatoes separately in a small bowl. It was a good burger! I had plenty of time before I had to head to the airport to catch my evening flight home, so I had the Devil's Lake Red Lager and Old Glory American Pale Ale as well to help finish off the burger.  Service: I had great service from the bartender. There was a big lunch rush, but she handled it very well. Not once did I feel neglected.  Overall: A burger and beers is a post race tradition for me, but I will definitely need to return for their cheese curds and other items on their menu. They had a somewhat small but decent selection of craft beer."}
{"text":"Super average experience... Maybe I am too picky.  (-) As huge fans of microbrews, every time we visit a new city we make a point to visit a brew pub and bring home a growler. After an entirely underwhelming experience at Great Dane, we actually sought out another brewery to bring loot home from. Try Ale Asylum instead.   (-) Food was meh. Tuna tataki was over-cooked (If it's sushi grade, it should be barely seared!), wings were good (the homemade Gorgonzola sauce was the best part of the meal), and tandoori chicken was a confusing Indian/Mediterranean fusion.  (+/-) Service was good although our server seemed a bit green, fumbling to remember the special brews.   (+/-) The scotch ale was pretty decent but the rest of the beer flight was completely unmemorable.   (+) The best part of Great Dane is their courtyard, outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Yes, it pains me to write this but it has been a long time coming.  I have been a life long fan of the 'Dane\" and have basically grew up with it...starting in college when it first opened in 1994.  It was always a place you could count on for outstanding beers and very solid food.  Unfortunately, this is no more.  The beers, once different and unique, are now pedestrian at best.  The Scotch Ale no longer has the flavor and finish that it used to.  The specials are \"special\" in name alone.  One can only conclude that cheaper ingredients and the large growth has caught up to them.  Same can be said about the food.  Always a big fan of the calamari with banana peppers, the appetizer now is overbreaded, overcooked, and lacks flavor. The same can't be said about the Texarkana burger.  Piled high with bacon, onion straws and slathered with BBQ sauce, the burger was juicy and flavorful.  A small highlight in an otherwise gloomy night.    For a visual perspective, the Fitchburg location is appealing and comfortable.  The dark wood in the bar and high ceilings make it welcoming.  I will say the dining room feels more like a Dennys that a brewpub however.  In 1994, the Dane was something new and different on the Madison restaurant scene.  Craft brews were still new and the concept of a brewpub was as well.  They did well establishing themselves and now it appears they are content to rest on their laurels.    With restaurants/bars/gastropubs sprinkled all throughout Madison that serve better beer and better fare, the Dane best wake up and improve or just locate in other cities (like Wausau) where the competition isn't as fierce."}
{"text":"The luster is slowly fading away from the brewpub.  In the years past, I would rave about the food and the quality of beer put out by the Great Dane.  I can't say that any longer.  Their beer is somewhat pedestrian and the food taste more and more like Sysco \"from a can\".  It is a shame as I have been a stalwart since they opened the original in 94/95.  Much better places to go in the area...Tipsy Cow, Old Fashioned, Coopers."}
{"text":"Best Sunday brunch around, despite the price! I tend to prefer the Hilldale location for any other meal though."}
{"text":"I'm not even sure how to feel about this place any more. So here's a quick run down. Food: Great. Beer: Great. Bar staff: Great. Wait staff: Not very good. Security: Atrocious. Management: Great. Noise for neighbors: Atrocious. Jukebox: Does not stack songs, do not attempt to recreate John Mulaney's best meal ever. (completely unrelated to security staff issues)"}
{"text":"I think the Dane is a decent place. They have good beer and decent food.   The best thing about the Great Dane is the artichoke dip. It tastes like heaven. The Dane Burger is also delicious, but that's because it has artichoke dip on it. They have very tasty fries.   I've had their root beer a couple of times and every time I drink it, it just gets worse. I don't know... maybe it's my taste buds. I really like their beers, though. They have other beers that aren't from their brewery, too, if you're like my mom and only drink Miller products out of a bottle (weird, I know).   Anyway, the Great Dane is great for groups and a good time, but their food could be better."}
{"text":"This is one of the best microbreweries in the Midwest. There are 3 \"microbreweries\" near my house, and in not a single one can you smell the malt. When you walk into the Dane, you smell the malt. They are really brewing beer, great beer in fact.  Their outside, enclosed patio garden is a splendid place to hang out. Very relaxed atmosphere, the walls covered with ivy. My brother lived in Madison for years, and this has always been one of his favorite haunts in Madison. We also love the food though of course it is typical beer bar food.  2008.07.09 update, yelper Steve D. sent me this note (see his Compliment on my profile): \"Good posts about Madison, WI. Great Dane brews very good beers. But a bill [SB 224] *allowed* it to open a third venue; but it also included language making it more difficult for other breweries to enter Wisconsin. It was stealthily passed. The Great Dane's desired language was added at the last minute as a political favor on a budget that was under pressure to be passed. \"As a result, small breweries will be severely limited in the options that they can undertake to grow their businesses. ...All because the distributors are afraid that if some brewery has a restaurant on their premises that this will somehow erode the three-tier system.\"\""}
{"text":"I've been here three times, and I've have a good time (but not great). The environment is open, very large (there's a bar, restaurant area, downstairs, AND outside seating area). Bartender is cool and gives great recommendations based on what beers you prefer (Coffee stout and dark ales for me please!), and I've never had to wait too long (even when busy).  But I'm not impressed by the food.  First of all, the menu is not made for people who cannot eat dairy, so my options were very limited. First time, I had the cajun chicken sandwich, which was definitely tasty, but nothing spectacular. I've also had the BBQ Meatloaf--again, very good, but nothing that wowed me. Best part of that meal was the tiny little fries topping the meatloaf. I've also had the Chang Mai Curry Noodle Bowl. I believe there's a little dairy in that bowl, so I ate with my discretion, and it was thick but delicious. Noodles were soft but not soggy, and the broth was salty, spiced, and tasted American-Thai. Chang Mai Curry Noodle Bowl is probably the only dish I'd be willing to repeat if I went again.  This menu is just not for me, only because I can't eat any of it. I can eat the wings and the salads, but then I'd just go to a place that specializes in wings and salads. I can see why people like coming here, and I'm always down to hang back with a beer; however, I wouldn't come back based on food alone.  Love the environment, like the food. I would come back, and hopefully I'll find a dish I can vouch for."}
{"text":"Oh, Great Dane. I want to love you, I want to give you four stars, but I really cannot do it.  The establishment is a little dimly lit, but it's got enough seats for a large group and places for two people. The menu is a \"newspaper\"--I'm a sucker for creative restaurant-fu.  The service is great, I've never had an issue with a waiter/waitress and they respond exceptionally well to food allergies. They're fast with food for the most part and they're very quick about refills on drinks.  Speaking of drinks, I don't even bother with alcoholic beverages here--I'm not a beer drinker but if you are, try it! My roommate loved his pilsner--I get their brewed root beer. I'm a rootbeer snob and theirs is just so damn good--a great sarsaparilla taste that any good root beer should taste of. I sometimes dream about bathing in it. It is really just that good.  The food--it's good. I really, honestly can't badmouth the food. However, I've never come out of this joint without having to go to the bathroom within 45 minutes of my first bite. I'm the only one this has happened to among my friends, so I'm thinking this is just how my body responds to their food--but it is solid. I've had burgers here, salads, mac & cheese, pizza--it all does it to me. But I'll keep doing it anyways because the food is just so damn good I can get over whatever pains I'll be in.  I want to love you, Great Dane, why won't you love me?"}
{"text":"I just went there for lunch today and had a heat-seeker's dream, the curry noodle bowl. All I can say is WOW! Great flavor in the curry soup and every ingredient sang from the pickled onions to the crispy fried noodles. It was so spicy sweat was rolling down my big rosy cheeks. I  pledge allegiance to Thai coconut curry noodle bowl, you got me a food win! I paired it with the Texas Speed Bump IPA, 'twas a solid brew for the undertaking."}
{"text":"I wanted to bounce around town and try as many different spots as I could.  I was in town for business and only had 2 nights.  After doing my Yelp research, Great Dane was my first stop. Its a very cool spot, just a block off the main park area of the Capital.    Beers were fantastic.  Started with their Kolsch and ended with their Cascade Mountain Porter on Cask  Quite impressed with both.   For an appetizer I had to order the Steamed Pork Buns.  They are crispy house cured pork belly glazed with an IPA hoisin sauce. Served in homemade steamed buns with radish, Bermuda onion, carrot, house pickled cucumber and scallion.  There had to be a reason steamed pork buns were on the menu, alongside so many other traditional \"pub\" options.  I found out.  They are absolutely delicious.  Thats why they are the 6th toe on the menu.  Great attentive, friendly, helpful service.    Wish I had more time in Madison.  Next trip....I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"I quite like the downtown Great Dane, and have probably been here about a dozen times.  First off, the downstairs bar is just the kind of place I like to drink: dim, cozy, a friendly barkeep and a TV I can watch soccer on.  I've always liked the Great Dane's burgers, and order them frequently. If you're going to have a burger on the menu that includes a brat patty, and bacon, there's really not much point in ordering anything else. For appetizers, the cheese curds are tasty as well as the poutine. I'm a fan of nachos and the Nakoma nachos here are delicious (and can be spicy as hell sometimes). Wings are par for the course and are tasty as well.  The Great Dane I think really shines when it comes to beer options. Their year-round offerings are very good and I find myself often saying \"this is what this style should taste like\" after having one. I'm always curious to find out what new brew has been scribbled artfully on the chalk board, so I'll often order a tasting round of them all. They don't always hit, but if you're an adventurous beer drinker you'll always leave happy."}
{"text":"The Great Dane is a go to when you want bar food. Their burgers are my favorite. I like to get the Dane burger since it has artichoke dip on it. If I'm feeling adventurous I even get the pretzel bun.  They brew their own beer and therefore you can only order beers brewed by them. They have many options so you can typically find something you like. Crop circle wheat is my personal favorite."}
{"text":"Before you make a judgement about this review, I just want to say before I'd start that I was a fan of the Great Dane before (Hilldale location)   So this start about a few day on a thursday, a few ago when I decided to go to the downtown location for lunch after meeting with a client and happen to say to myself \"let's give Great Dane a go\" and my first comeback visit was ok but not the best to say because the bartender was either talking to much to the employees off shift or friends, so I can't say but it was the best when at the time have questions. but I do not eat meat products but I only eat seafood. So yes, I'm a pescetarian and ask about IPA beers and the only one stood out was the Texas Bump and it was ok but it was the fish that had so much fish batter that it overpower the fish taste and quality. Keep in mind I used to live here as a undergrad student and after that I come back to Madison each summer but I haven't been to the G.D in such a long time. Then just yesterday, my friend from India and Chicago (native west african), we felt that we were not be taken seriously enough as customers. When I ask for a menu again to see if I wanted to start something difference, it was as if they has something against us. My friend also had questions this time around and the bartenders just walk pass us and I had to fill the role as bartender to answer this questions about beer. Now he is a light drinker from India and we got the Landmark Lite for him and that a minute if you understand what a minute is.   But when I got my food and started to eat, I felt a little light headed and didn't feel good at all and cash out and left before my friend back to the Hostel which was down the street. As soon as I step in the hostel, my staff notice my skin color and I barf and barf for about 5 minutes in the restroom and i knew what got me sick. Their fish at the Great Dane. NOTICE: I didn't eat all day because I was busy with work and laundry, therefore I want to clear the air and ask to not cross contaminated the fish and the bartender look at me as if I was either crazy or being a picky.   I will never go back to the Great Dane ever again and it was a waste of $18 dollars for a New London two piece and a beer that tasted weird but there again I did lose my sense of taste and smell in a car accident but no excuse for food like fish to get me sick. The only time this has happen when I was visit San Diego and this place call  BarleyMash that had the same results and it was due to cross contamination. So later that night I started to feel better and the staff at the hostel was checking up on me and wanted to be sure before they get off shift if they needed to call the emergency services and there was no need for that. So what a waste of money but thi experience tells me that their are not open minded or open arm to international relationships or understand what a pescetarian is. But The Hilldale was more open minded when I did visit there and explain and was a great experience. so that is why I left this review with two stars. (it should be one star) It's time for a education lesson about pescetarian. ( NO MEAT products - means No cheese, or Milk either). I should go back to filed a complaint. Just don't go there if you are pescetarian or vegan, it's not friendly at this locations"}
{"text":"What a great location--and they've made it even better with the patio, decor, seating.  Just great, along with the food.  And being from a craft beer mecca like San Diego, we really appreciate the history of the brewing here. So, why not a 5 star experience?  In a word, Eric. Unhappy, combative fellow who needs to find a job he likes. No amount of jollying the boy could make him into an even tolerable waiter.  Add that final whiff of racism and it was the complete package. Family member? Blackmailing the G Dane?  No matter. Gotta lose a guy who drives away return business."}
{"text":"This place absolutely IS super touristy, let me just say that. But  for what it is, it's pretty cute, the food's quite good, and we had a blast.   I recommend going on a Friday night- my husband and I each ordered from their Fish Fry specials, and both dishes were really excellent. They had fresh, seasonal veggies as a side option too, which was great. Most of what I tried seemed to be made from scratch, which is also a plus. Is this the pinnacle of fine dining? Nope. Is it the highlight of top local fare? Also no. But is it a decent and fun  place to go and get a  delicious dinner? Sure is! And, the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Saturday's ago with my fiance for a late lunch.  The place looked pretty busy but that wasn't a problem since we were immediately seated in a booth.   There's not really much to say about the inside of the place as there is a bar area in one half of the restaurant and then a dining area in the other half up a stair or two.  The walls are brick and the tables are a darker wooden color.  I think I also noticed a sign that talked about a beer garden although I personally did not visit it.  Since I was celebrating the completion of another marathon that morning, I decided to go with a flight of beers.  My flight came out situated in a serving dish that was in the shape of a dog bone.  I thought that was cool, especially since it fit in so well with their name.  All of the beers were pretty good and stayed true to the types that they were advertised as.  After a bit of a wait to order our appetizer, my fiance and I  went with the beer-battered cheese curds.  There was another wait (this happened quite a few times where our server disappeared for long periods of time) before we got our cheese curds.  They were delicious as the curds were gooey inside the battering.  My only complaint was that I couldn't really tell that the batter had any beer in it, yet they were still good.  For my entree I decided to go with the Wisconsin style cheddar mac and topped it off with the buffalo chicken.  It also came topped with sourdough crumbs and was served with a thick pretzel stick.  The macaroni and cheese was thick and gooey and tasted nicely while the buffalo chicken that I added was good as well.  I think that my favorite part of the meal was that after I had finished the pasta I used the pretzel stick to scoop up the rest of the cheese sauce from my dish.  Whoever thought of adding that to the meal was a genius!  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future.  I really enjoyed both the beer that I ordered and the food, now if only our server could have been a bit more attentive to us."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim as it was next door to my hotel.. But holy crap was it a lucky score. French onion soup.. Amazing. Club.. To die for. Unlike any club you could imagine. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I love their brat burger. But this time we visited their fried cheese curds were average by KANSAS standards and their beer tasted just like every other brewery out there. Worse, they only stock their own beer. So, I guess they earn three stars."}
{"text":"This place is way overrated. It is a decent pub place with good Wisconsin grub, but nothing I would wait over 15 minutes to get. Their beers are good as they brew all of the beer themselves which is cool. Yet, the Great Dane is more a big name in Madison that under delivers on quality of food."}
{"text":"Great Dane is more or less an institution in town, and I've been there many times but this review has to do with their brunch. Oy veyyyyyy!  So the location is, of course, ideal and it's a perfect meeting spot for some day drinking... i mean... bloody mary's and mimosas.... cuz I'm an adult and I wouldn't drink before noon unless it was called something classier.   Anyways, so I had the biscuits and gravy and they were SO DRY! It was kind of like doing that crazy eating competition where you eat a spoonful of cinnamon and your entire mouth, throat and nose are instantly moisture-less? I mean, I've never done that before, but I can imagine that my experience with their B&G is similar enough. It caused me to guzzle my mimosa and water.   The dining room was chock full of families and little kiddos. Now, I'm not opposed to taking your cutie-patooties out, BUT, my experience there wasn't pleasant due to the numerous screaming babies and kids with balloons frolicking about. Our server seemed about as over it as we were. We really couldn't get out fast enough.  There are better brunch locales in town."}
{"text":"You just can never go wrong with the Dane.  It's our go-to when we can't decide where to go and they never disappoint.  Something for everyone on the menu, and almost everything is excellent.    And the beer is great."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends not expecting much as I thought that this place was only for the beer. But boy was I wrong. We had a fantastic server named Jake who helped us choose the best burger called the BBQ Piedmont burger and a house brewed beer to pair it with. He was so friendly and really made us feel at home while we dined there. Overall it was a great experience and will definitely be coming back soon!!"}
{"text":"The 5 stars is 100% for their brunch buffet.  Picture this... a room full of chafing dishes, a cook making omelets in the back, and Chocolate Shoppe ice cream by the dessert table.  They literally have a version of every breakfast food that exists, a nacho bar, giant fillets of smoked salmon, and I have even seen all the fixings for a full on Thanksgiving dinner.  I will be very honest, I have ditched church on several occasions so I can be first in line at 10am on Sunday morning. I think God understands and approves.  Plan to stay at least 2 hours and wear your classiest stretchy pants (I aspire to believe that these can exist).  I've been to all the Great Dane locations in town, this one just happens to be my favorite. Their regular menu has really good items. You really can't go wrong. This place is very Wisconsin so is a great place to take out of town visitors."}
{"text":"I came with friends to celebrate their first day of work we shared a pitcher of the circle wheat with lemon. Great choice. It was enough for 5 glasses. I wish we had ordered a second pitcher!  I loved their menus which are newspapers. I thought it was an actual newspaper and started reading it and didn't realize until I opened it.  I ended up with a turkey burger and fries. It was delicious and filling. We sat outside and had great conversation. It got a bit busy.  Definitely great for groups. I'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"All the dane locations are good (ok, i haven't done wausau yet...). I've been impressed with the consistency. The food is good (get the nachos!). Pizza and burgers are also good, but i don't have a lot of faith in their ability to go too far beyond standard pub fare (skip the peanut stew, falafal, mexican, etc. IMO). The beer is good (apa!). I especially like the aged apa from the hand pump when they have it... All in all, i nice casual place with good service and outdoor dining. I don't hesitate to bring out of towners here.  update: the fish tacos are actually pretty good! beware the hot salsa.  and the hot pretzels with horseradish/cranberry dip is good too."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Beer needs to catch up. Southwest tortellini & Texarkana burger were awesome. Disappointed that there was no IPA on menu."}
{"text":"The Great Dane has been one of my go-to restaurants in Madison. It consistently has good food and a fun atmosphere. When it's warm out, I believe their garden patio is one of the best in Madison. I also find myself in there for late night fun, since they have a nice shuffleboard table and plenty of pool tables. The bar area is kind of loud, but they also have a large dining room to accommodate a more intimate & casual dining experience. Their menu is very diverse, with a great selection of salads and unique healthy options, as well as classics like burgers and Mac n cheese. I haven't made it there for brunch yet but I've heard good things!  As an appetizer I've had their calamari, which was a very generous portion for two people, and their cheese curds, which are some of the best I've had in Wisconsin! I ordered the couscous, which was just okay but my friend had their buffalo chicken Mac n cheese which was really good! We also tried out some of their specialty cocktails, they make a really good dark and stormy!  All in all, I would recommend this place to anyone. It has whatever kind of atmosphere you're looking for!"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night and got seated right away.  We ordered the cheese curds which had good flavor and 2 different cheese burgers. The burgers were awesome with a perfect medium cook! We had a great waitress who really knew the menu and was able to give us suggestions on beverages. I had the lakeshore lager which is one of their own brews.  It was enjoyable and I would be interested in trying some of their others.  I stuck to 1 due to our own time constraint.  Would love to go back and sit on their patio during the day.  It was very nice outside.  Can't wait to try some of their other food!"}
{"text":"I love not only the hand crafted beer at Great Dane,but the beer as well.  This location is great for both dinner and a night on the town."}
{"text":"I'm pretty surprised I've never reviewed this Great Dane considering I've been here dozens and dozens of times over the years. As with many people, I fall in the camp that the Dane is a great place when you have a mix of interests and backgrounds and want to go out. Whether you're with hipsters, bros, parents, or coworkers, the Dane is going to satisfy everyone, if not actually downright please them.   On the food and drink side, there are plenty of options that mostly hover in the pub food genre, but there are enough unconventional options to keep it interesting. They brew their own beer so the selection is limited in some sense - Great Dane brews aren't at the top of my list, but I truly enjoy the Stone of Scotch Ale and ordered Crop Circle Wheat for years before that. Favorite food items include the James Madison Pub Picnic in the winter, the California Turkey Club, the Webster Street Chicken salad, and the Dane Burger. I almost always order the mashed potatoes as a side. While not everything I've sampled is spectacular, I've also never had a \"bad\" meal.   The thing we end up at this Dane the most for, though, is Big Buck Hunter. I have no interest in hunting and am in general not a video/arcade gamer, but there's something my group has found addictively fun about this game. At the Dane there's plenty of room around the machine for us to play as a group, and they recently got Big Buck HD - I don't like it as much as Safari, but it's more challenging and the technology is more responsive. NERD NERD NERD.   TL;DR - the Dane's got something for everyone."}
{"text":"When my boyfriend and I moved to Madison (just 2 blocks away from the Great Dane) this past August, a family member gave us a gift card here and talked it up as the best restaurant downtown. This place is so overrated. It's basically an overpriced Perkins. Our first time there I got a burrito and my boyfriend got their chicken pot pie. He loved it, but despite my asking for the burrito to be extra spicy it tasted like bland sock full of rice. Despite this first experience, we returned a couple times for utterly forgettable meals, that is until we went last night for what will certainly be out last time. The last few times I went, I figured I might have been ordering their worst menu items, but as a WI native I figured they couldn't screw up a Friday fish fry. Boy was I wrong. My cod tasted like cafeteria food that I would get from my grandpa's assisted living facility. The fish was bland and overcooked, and came with undercooked green beans with not even a pinch if salt on them. I could have gotten the same thing from a frozen entree at the grocery store. And then there was the Philly Cheesesteak that my boyfriend got; presliced roast beef with Velveeta sauce... Philadelphians would be disgusted. Not to mention that I had 2 whiskey sours that both tasted like vodka lemonades. To top it all off we were given the wrong bill at the end of the night. Don't waste your money or your time at this place. The Old Fashioned has a much better fish fry and the bartenders know how to mix a drink. Any other night of the week Get the bangers and mash at Brocach. Just go anywhere but the Great Dane."}
{"text":"Food great and so was the beer. I had an America something pale ale and it was very drinkable and not too bitter hoppy as they can be sometimes. Cool place with big menu, lots to choose from. Our dinner party of 4 decided to just order a bunch of appetizers and graze. The african peanut soup was amazing, tuna very good and so were the chicken wings and tilapia fish tacos. Service very good, really good waitress we had. I would go here again anytime."}
{"text":"The Great Dane Pub and Brewing Company is one of the finest drinking establishments I've been to!  They have TV's galore, plenty of seating (including an area with leather couches), 4 pool tables, a shuffle board table, two dart boards and a juke box.  On top of all that fun, they make their own craft beer!  The atmosphere is great, never gets so loud that you can't hear your group talking.  They also have a full menu with TONS to choose from!  I'm not from the Madison area, but Great Dane is a place I'd go anytime I'm there."}
{"text":"So, they may as well have played \"Glory Days\" when I walked in here for dinner the other night. I have very fond memories of this place from when I was in my early 20s and used to visit friends that went to school here. Maybe I was one of those annoying people that Yelpers are complaining about being drunk and obnoxious.  However, going there in my 30's is quite a different experience, namely we went there before Midnight. That being said, no matter what the \"Dane\" does it will always have a special place in my heart.  Okay, the food.....The food is okay. I think it is the place where you just order a burger or the like because their menu is quite extensive and I am not sure they have the skill or food quality to really pull off all sorts of different genres of good. I usually stick to the Veggie burger and Portabella and they turn out great. Some of the other food ordered at our tables.....not so great.  Beer: One of the beers my husband ordered came at room temp, which would be fine if we were in England however he didn't know it came warm and when we inquired the server just said \"it came off the pull tap\" Okayyy....what the hell does that mean? Could we just get a cold beer all up in this? Thanks! The server then got him a new one, which was cold. The Circle Wheat was good/refreshing however was a little too sour for my liking.  Scene: It was a really beautiful day in Madison and we were really enjoying the patio that is covered with vines and nice and cool in the shade. The patio is where it is at and with good friends, the mediocre good can be overlooked."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  Pool tables.  Menu is barely adequate.  There's better places around the square."}
{"text":"While downtown near the capitol, my friend and I decided to check out Yelp and find a good place for lunch nearby.  The Great Dane had excellent reviews and was only a short walk away so we headed over.  This place didn't look too spacious when we walked in but they have plenty of space.  We ended up getting a table on the patio which was perfect for the September day.    Both the drink menu and the food menu looked great and I asked our server for some beer recommendations.  My friend ended up getting a sampler and I had a pint.  I tried a few of her samples and they were as awesome as my pint.    I can't actually recall what sandwich I ordered but it was delicious.  They do an awesome job here.  I will definitely stop by the next time I am back in town."}
{"text":"We like to go to the Dane from time to time and typically the food is good.  Standard each time and doesn't change much. My issue with this trip was this.  I ordered a Caesar Salad before my meal.  While eating the salad I bit into something very bitter.  No worries I think and continue to eat.  About a minute later I find a great big bug swimming in the dressing near the bottom of the bowl.   I spit out the salad in my mouth and told the waiter I was pretty disgusted and was pretty upset.  He took the salad and said a manager would be by to talk to us.  Finally the bill comes and we still hadn't seen a manager.  The waiter knocked the salad off the bill (how could he not) and my soda.  I am not looking for a freebie but in a situation like this a manager should swing by and at least offer an apology.    The server did his best to make up for the lack of management and we still left him 20% because it wasn't his fault.    Great Dane you should realize that when there is a mistake of this magnitude a manager really should stop and say something.  Heck make something up and low to me.   Anything.....Instead you left the server out to hang for the situation and had my wife not been a server for years I would have made a huge scene made sure to let the entire place know of my newly ingested snack.   Might go back, might.  But will tell anyone who mentions the Dane this story."}
{"text":"7/1 This is a really nice location.  We were seated next to a huge picture window which our son thought was a real treat.    The menu is not standard pub fare.  It's more upscale with a lot of different choices.  My husband decided to finally try poutine and that was his dinner along with a glass of their Imperial IPA.  I was eyeing their meatloaf but ended up going with a Texarkana burger.  It was good - standard bacon cheeseburger with BBQ sauce but it was tasty.  Our server could have been Chris Evans' twin brother.  Kind of cool to be waited on by the faux brother of Captain America.  :)  The growlers are cheap ($18 filled with the IPA) and the service is good.  Add in the great food and the cool location, and it was a fun night out!"}
{"text":"Ordered a gin and ginger. Bartender forgot to add the ginger syrup. Entire table sampled my drink, no one could detect a hint of ginger. When I went back up and asked for it, both bartenders made jokes about \"the guy complaining because he wants ginger ale.\" As a matter of fact, I did want ginger ale. When I ordered my drink the waitress said \"ale\" or \"beer.\" If I'd known that \"ale\" meant \"we'll put club soda in, forget the ginger syrup we use, and then mock you for asking us to make the drink correctly\" I would have just skipped out on The Great Dane entirely.  Manager came after 20 minutes, behaved in an incredibly rude and dismissive manner after hearing the events. I told him that all I wanted was for his bartender to make my drink correctly the first time or, barring that, to not be an ass after getting a request. I told him it was unacceptable, and swore because at this point I was frustrated by the awful service. He screamed \"WE'RE DONE!!!!\" Snatched the drink (my first of the evening which I'd barely sipped), and ran off. No one in my party of 4 will be visiting this establishment again. There are plenty of better bars in Madison, like Gibs on Willy St, that know how to make a drink and provide reasonable customer service."}
{"text":"I've been here more times than I can count, generally for the cheese curds and the games. Last time I was there (mid June 2015), the cheese curds weren't that great and we were told it was a new recipe. Hopefully they go back to the old recipe! The nachos are always a generous portion and delicious. It can be difficult to get a bar tender's attention, however, as they always seem to be busy."}
{"text":"This is a 3 star restaurant with a single reason for the fourth star: the beer garden. Great Dane is sort of like the Cheesecake Factory of Dane County-- a jack of all trades where the menu is broad, diverse, and mediocre. The beer leaves something to be desired. But MAN THE BEER GARDEN IS SO AWESOME. Ivy climbs up over the walls and creates an absolutely perfect atmosphere. I'd eat mediocre food and boring beer all day there."}
{"text":"I pretty much want to move to Madison to eat all of the food on the menu and drink all the beer.  My boyfriend and I came here - based on Yelp reviews - while we were in Madison for the night.  We're a big fan of local craft and microbreweries/ brew pubs and make it a point to visit them when we're out of town.    We got there around 8:30 on a Friday, and it was pretty crowded.  (Always a good sign in my mind!)  They told us it was going to be about a 40 minute wait so we each grabbed a beer.  I got the Crop Circle Wheat and he got the Double Dubbel.  The Crop Circle was one of the best wheat beers I've had in a while.  Less than 20 minutes later, they seated us.  I love the decor and over all vibe of this place.  The exposed brick walls, newsprint menus, and the dark wood.  It's huge too.  I didn't realize how crazy big it was!  There were so many tasty sounding options on the menu.  We started with the beer bread and honey butter.  The bread was good, but the butter was amazing.  I pretty much wanted to spoon it directly into my mouth... but eating straight butter is kind of gross no matter how delicious it is.  For dinner I got the Applewood Bacon Burger with the buffalo patty on a pretzel roll with the sweet plantains on the side.  I've been on a huge plantains kick lately so the fact that they had plantains pretty much make me jump for joy.  My boyfriend got the brat bacon burger which he loved but wasn't even able to finish because it was so huge.  Also, I love the fact that they focus on using a lot of local and sustainable food - local cheese, local grass-fed beef and local buffalo.  The staff was SO friendly.  I think it might just be that people in Wisconsin are the friendliest people on the planet, but everyone was just so happy and nice and well...perky.  The service was great too."}
{"text":"We heard about this place from our concierge desk at the hotel.  It's close to Madison square and easy to get to.  It must be a popular place for company meetings and parties since the private dining room was fully booked.    The experience was disappointing.  They had run out of several beer selections on our visit which made the meal less attractive.  The 3 alarm buffalo wings are supposedly the  second to the hottest with the habanero being the hottest.  Everyone at the table agreed that the wings were taco bell hot and that we made a mistake by not ordering the habanero.  The beer battered cheese curds were just ok.  Beer batter is always very heavy and you really couldn't taste the cheese through the coating.  The main courses were just ok as well.  The 16oz NY strip steak was seasoned nicely and it came with large onion rings and asparagus.  $24 seemed a bit pricey for brew pub food though.    While it was busy, we feel we didn't get the attention from our server that we should have.  This was a business dinner where we were required to get separate checks and that added more confusion to the situation. It took our server three trips to get everyone taken care of.  I get that this is a college town and that you will have high turnover, but the experience for the prices this establishment charges is just not worth it."}
{"text":"Fuck waiting for food bruh I didn't even sit down here because it took them so long to seat me had a reservation lul why the fuck even make reservations now a days if they're gonna seat you 45 min"}
{"text":"I love the Great Dane!  The man and I come here often for brunch and it never disappoints.  For $15 you get a really great spread of food that ranges from fried fish and shrimp, to waffles and an array of desserts.  Everything is really fresh and delicious.  They even have an omelet and prime rib bar that the man always partakes in.    Outside of their brunch, I've tried their peanut stew which is so good I can't even put words to it!  The man loves their wings and he claims they may be some of the best wings in Madison.  I recently tried this rice dish they have that is wrapped in banana leaves and served with fried plantain that again was just wonderful.  And though they do not have popular beers brands, because they brew their own, their selection of beer is expansive and good.  The service whether for the brunch or any other meal is always stand out!  The servers are always polite, friendly, and attentive.     At times we visit on weekend nights and have found that this is a great place to watch the game or chill with a large group of people.  The most surprising thing about this place is that it seems like such a unique place but has several locations.  Despite that though this place is great and has easily become one of my favorite places to eat in Madison."}
{"text":"Have always loved the Dane. Even after moving away for more than 6 years now, it's hard to pass up when I'm in town. Favorites: drunken jerk pork, Texarkana burger, hot soft pretzels, enchiladas, tomato soup. Beer favorites: stone of scone and the hand drawn cask ales (though all are good)."}
{"text":"The craft beer here is excellent.  We enjoyed the scotch ale and a light lager, both of which were smooth, creamy perfection.  Food is good but...come here to drink."}
{"text":"Two paths diverged into a wood, and be one traveller, long I stood...ok I took the path that offered really great craft beer and eats.  Great Dane delivered this very weary, strung out traveller one of the best interpretations of a German pilsner out there.  Two 16oz'ers disappeared like water in the desert (and for all practical purposes it is a desert here in Madison...about 100 deg F.).  Rarely has the confluence of thirst, heat, 18 hrs of driving, mental and physical fatigue, and just overall feeling beat been better medicated.  Livingstone would've been well advised to pack some cold ones from GD on his epic trek.  Food was solid.  The Wisconsin fried cheddar cheese balls were like mozzarella sticks for cheese-heads, and the Dane burger, served char broiled with artichoke sauce, was delish.  Atmosphere was typical high end pub, and service was spot-on.  I suspect that, like the traveller in Frost's poem, GD has and will continue to make all the difference...at least with regard to my sobriety."}
{"text":"I was here for a business trip and decided to try the local pubs around town. The Great Dane has a great vibe when you walk in. It looks like an old school pub, but very clean and classy.   I would suggest to go here for the beer, the food isn't anything to write home about. My party ordered the poutine fries. The fries were fresh and the gravy wasn't too bad. I ordered a burger, which wasn't particularly memorable. The service was okay. Our waitress was polite, but not particularly attentive or warm."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Madison, I make a point of having the buffalo burger... YUM!  I haven't had a pint here that I didn't like yet!"}
{"text":"Took our family on a Thursday afternoon. Kids meals are good and are very reasonably priced.  DH thoroughly enjoyed the burger brat on a pretzel bun. I loved the Chicken Peanut Stew. Falafel wrap I got was tasty but dry.  We had beer sampler and agreed that Black Earth porter, Stout, and Crop Circle Wheat were best.  Waiter was very uncharismatic, but the place has a character of its own."}
{"text":"Eat on the patio, grab a burger and brew.  Best beer, the verucht stadt."}
{"text":"This review is more for our server than the restaurant. I don't know her name, but she had a mocha colored complexion, shoulder length wavy/curly dark brown hair, and honey colored eyes. Maybe around 23-27.   We went in for Friday night fish fry after a gallery reception at my work and needless to say, she was perfect. She was fast and got us refills with out even asking. She was attentive, but not too much. But on top of being a good server, she was incredibly nice and very real. A great smile and clearly very good at her job. As a server I know some tables make I hard to be natural, but she was effortless.  I don't know her name, but please let this lady know she was incredible. Just for being natural and attentive."}
{"text":"i go back and forth on this place. sometimes i love it, sometimes i hate it. the food is consistently decent and the beer is good.  the downtown location is hands down my favorite of all three because it has the most character, not to mention one of the coolest beer gardens i've ever seen. but despite how huge this place is, it gets packed, usually with unsavory characters (read: brahs and trixies).   we made the mistake of making this our new year's eve 2009 destination because of the central location. we got there early enough to snag a table, eat and not pay a cover, so that was cool. the dj set up and started playing an eclectic mix of stuff. so far so good, right?   then things went downhill fast. suddenly the place was packed beyond capacity, and the dj started playing lady gaga. a friend and i went outside for a cigarette and were assured by the bouncer that we would get back in... and then couldn't. because they were past capacity. even though we were wearing wrist bands and had been sitting at a table for hours. after enough bitching to the right people, the manager let us in the back door.  moral of the story: don't go here late, and don't go here to celebrate a party holiday. otherwise it's mostly alright."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of food and I have enjoyed everything I have tried. The conserve-a-berger optioned as a buffalo burger is heavenly. There draft selection is also varied and vast. Often very busy so plan to wait a bit for a table on weekends."}
{"text":"These 5 stars are all for WILL. Will was an exceptional server, and I'm pretty sure he and Elise hit it off. True love. Dylan really liked the ice cream! Whoa! Way to go Will! What a treat!  u byeeeeeeee"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places downtown to go.  Never had a bad experience here.  Very comfortable, fun, casual atmosphere.  Love all of their beers. The Cropped Circle Wheat and Stone of Scone Scotch Ale are my two favorites.   Typically when my roommate and I come here we just order beer and nachos and whip out our cribbage board. Then we'll just drink and play for like three hours.  Fun fun!"}
{"text":"My first time in Wisconsin so you know I had to try some cheese curds. Started off with the fried variety, as well as poutine. The cheese curds were very addictive and not too greasy. The gravy with the poutine was excellent, and we got pork on top for some extra calories that we obviously desperately needed.   For my dinner I got the Wisconsin style cheddar Mac and cheese with buffalo chicken. The pasta was rigatoni, which made for a perfect vessel to contain large quantities of gooey cheese sauce. The Gorgonzola was slightly overpowering for my tastes, I would have liked to have tasted the cheddar more clearly. There was no scarcity of chicken. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"The beers are solid, the tap lineup is quite expansive for a brewpub (most have 6 to 10 tops online at any given time while I've never seen fewer than a dozen at the Dane), the food ranges from good to very good, the building is cool, and it has probably the best biergarten in all of the Midwest. So this really should be at least a 4-star joint. But when the wife and I run up an $80 food and drink tab and you bring us a bill that includes a 50-cent line-item for extra pickles on a burger, you lose a star. Seriously? We drop 8 sawbucks here and you upcharge us for extra fucking pickles? That is some serious skinflintery, not to mention just plain bad form."}
{"text":"visited this \"original\" location with friends from work.  atmosphere was decent.  if u are of \"darker\" complection, u get weird looks from other patrons.  i mean, we \"stood out\" a bit, but folks here are a bit obvious with their \"weird\" looks.  anyhow, I'm giving this place 3 stars and here's the breakdown:  food:  4 stars good portion size. that's if you stick to anything \"american\".  Example was a friend ordered the Tandoori Chicken plate... well, there's nothing Tandoori about it.  The chicken looked like they came off the grill (which is not how tandoori's are done) and had some spices thrown on top of it.  She didn't like it.  the bback ribs were excellent however.  Again if you stick to the \"american\" grub you'll be fine.  Another friend ordered the rib eye medium-well, it was a bit over done.  atmosphere:  3 stars.  decent typical bar scene in a college town/business district.  nothing spectacular but then again, you wouldn't expect anything more or anything less.  service:  1 star.  we had an extremely rude server who gave us attitude as soon as we sat down.  it appeared he was not happy about having out-of-town business type people because as soon as we asked for separate checks, he threw an attitude and was quite rude.  rolled his eyes a couple times!!! he was \"special\" and if you do visit this joint and get Eric as ur server, look out!!!  This place could have been better but again, if you can look pass the annoyances and focus on the food, you'll definitely like this place.  BTW, the microbrew was not too shabby.  the beer sampler was pretty good.  \"Piece\" out!!!"}
{"text":"Ok lunch, I guess, not really a chain gang kind of person. I know they have great beer and if you want to play pool this could be a good spot for you..."}
{"text":"A great place to hang out, especially after an Ultimate Frisbee game. They have a menu that's printed like a newsletter because it changes every season, I'm told. All of the things on the menu are what you might find at a typical pub: meatloaf, burgers, cheese curds, sandwiches, salads, fries, etc. I recommend the fish tacos, which are under 'Appetizers' for some reason. They're not quite the same as fish tacos you might have in Austin or California, but for Wisconsin they are alright. Beware the mango habanero sauce though. It will kick your ass. Each plate comes with three tacos and additional tacos are $2.50 each. A taco is comprised of a piece of fried cod (whitefish?) topped with pico de gallo and lettuce with a \"touch of mayonnaise.\" And there's a wedge of lime, chipotle BBQ sauce (weird, right?? Who eats their taco with BBQ sauce?) and the aforementioned mango habanero sauce. They also have a delicious looking buffalo chicken mac & cheese which I might try on a future, post-Frisbee game visit.  A few notes about The Great Dane: if you want separate checks, you have to let the server know in advance. Also, they bring the check(s) all at once.  [Edit: don't get the New Mexico Green Chili. It is nothing close to what the menu description says. 1) there are no chunks of tender pork, just chunks of dry, tasteless chicken and beef. 2) I did not find any sour cream or green chilis. I am disappoint.]"}
{"text":"A Madison staple! Beer brewed on site, a large menu of of a mix of traditional pub fare and American. Sometimes the wait gets long as it is one of the more popular restaurants in town, but it is worth every minute!"}
{"text":"The Dane is always a great fall back when every other restaurant is packed; or when you crave some delicious pub grub! The food is typical Wisconsin cuisine but definitely above average. They brew their own beers, so depending on the season can differ, but are equally delicious. not to mention you can buy a jug of it to take home with you. As with all restaurant around/near the square The Dane can fill up quickly on Friday/Saturday evenings. But the wait isn't terribly bad, especially if you can muscle up to the bar and satisfy your thirst while waiting."}
{"text":"My sister and I were in Madison and went to Great Dane twice in one week!! Beer, food,,service and atmosphere were all good. Cheese curds were delicious, pretzel basket was tasty try the spicy mustard dip. Our favorite is the tomato mushrooms soup it was hot and enjoyed each time on our cold fall visit."}
{"text":"I came here with a co-worker for a quick dinner when I was in Madison on business.  The food, drinks, and service was all good!  We enjoyed our Great Dane-brewed beers, the cheese curds were delicious, and our burgers were good too!  The service was polite and prompt, and the ambiance was very \"old school\" pub-like.  Good spot!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner while in town to see The Lion King and our visit was fantastic.   For starters, the service was excellent. We were seated right away despite it being pretty busy and very loud when we arrived. Our server was very attentive and quick. We also had two other waiters stop by our table to pick up dishes; seems like they all like to help each other.  Now the food. I got the Texarkana Burger which came with the works: bacon, haystack onions, and a spicy cream cheese sauce on the side. I usually never eat anything spicy, but this stuff was the bomb. I ended up using most of it for my fries. Keep some water near if you're like me and you like everything on the mild side!  Tl;dr: One of the BEST burgers I've ever had. We were all very pleased with the food and speedy service. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Some of their menu items are clear misses for me, like their calamari appetizer (very oily) and their Buffalo chicken style mac and cheese (the pasta is too large and it doesn't feel like a cohesive dish), but most of their dishes are very good. A few things are a bit pricey but the portion sizes make up for that. And the service every time I've come here has been friendly and prompt. I don't think there's one particular thing here that I'd recommend you try but this place is a pretty good bet if you're looking for a pub to go to in the area."}
{"text":"First time back to this place in several years.  Also one of the first times I've had a beer that was essentially undrinkable.  Fun environment, but I wouldn't go back again for the beer alone."}
{"text":"This pub lives up to the hype of a local landmark. Pleasant with charm and a menu diverse enough for any college town.  But the airport version/franchise is overpriced and the service is rude, just like most airport bars."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch. Fabulous beer \"crop circle wheat\" cloudy with lemon and went down like a treat. We ate outside in the lovely patio which reminded me of being in Italy, the creeping ivy up the brick walls looks amazing. Had the california turkey club and fries, very tasty! My wife had the grilled cheese and raw vegetables also delicious. Service was really good. Can't wait to return when we go back to Madison."}
{"text":"Interesting menu with great bears.  There are multiple locations, I picked the one nearest the capitol.  The place was huge, complete with billiards downstairs.  I had their soup and salad option with their creamy bacon potato soup and their caesar salad.  The caesar dressing was pleasantly creamy without that strong vinegary taste some have.  Pricing was more than fair.  My lady and I ordered two sampler bones (four 4oz pours brought to you on a wooden dog bone that has numbers under the glasses that correlate to with a name board they give you, simple but very helpful!).  The majority of the beer tasted great and very fresh, like beers from a brew pub should.  My lady got the fried plantains and they were amazing!  Not chalky, rather creamy and sweet!"}
{"text":"Every time I have gone to Great Dane the food has been excellent. The first time I went I had the Portabella mushroom sandwich, and more recently I had the Paoli Vegetable sandwich with fried plantains. Both are excellent and besides the food they have a great beer selection since they are also a brewery."}
{"text":"Brunch was good with lots of options to choose from.  The staff is friendly and even with being busy they are able to keep drinks full and the table clear of dishes.  Bloody Mary's along with craft beers make this a great place to start any Sunday."}
{"text":"After an entire day of drinking, my friends and I ended up at Great Dane for dinner. After an entire day of drinking, I needed something hearty, filling, and delicious to soak up all of the liquor. I had the Chicken Pot Pie from here and loved it."}
{"text":"A local favorite of mine This is a great place to grab a drink after work, or to meet friends.   an interesting crowd... but good food, nice waiting staff and a pool tables!"}
{"text":"Typical university campus microbrewery. I tried a couple of the beers (IPA and American Pale Ale) and they were ok, definitely not extraordinary by any means.   On to the food! I bypassed the special, half rack of ribs and chicken for a full rack. Mistake #1. By the time I got done with the first half rack, of the full rack mind you, I was tired of chewing on cold bbq baby back ribs. It would have been nice to switch to some chicken. damn. regrets. Bottom line, the food was ok keeping this one at 3 stars still. I will not fault the restaurant for my ordering blunders.   Well the staff is nice enough to keep this at 3 stars. More typical. But they are just hip enough for a midwestern kid to get starry eyes.   The pool tables are nice quality. $8 an hour after 6pm."}
{"text":"Wish we wouldn't have chosen to eat/drink here on our first visit to Madison. IPA was horrible. Not even close to hoppy. Very flat and malty tasting. Food was also horrible. I had a burger and fries. Burger was dry and the bun reminded me of a bun you would get on a mcdouble from mcdonalds. Fries were bland. Service was okay! Will not be back."}
{"text":"Solid time, every time.  Have never had bad food or bad service.  Appreciate they seem to switch things up on the menu occasionally, keeps things interesting!"}
{"text":"I guess you could say we made the mistake of going at a time they offered Sunday brunch which none of us wanted. We had to order off the section of a menu I like to call only eat this when your drunk. While tasty the food sat in my stomach all afternoon like a sack of bricks. We three opted to order a few \"fun\" items and share. I chose the poutine (so effing good), another mate ordered a cheese burger (average gastro burger imo), and a plate of boneless wings with hot buffalo (pretty darn good but way over priced as per usual). All in all tasty indulgences that were worth the tummy ache of poor nutrition. Maybe next time we will try the brunch buffet."}
{"text":"Very good Beer!  The food is not to bad either however lets be honest you are going there for the beer."}
{"text":"I dined in the beer garden (downstairs) and it was beautiful! I decided to be a piggy and ordered the cheese curds, poutine, steak, side salad and 4 beer sampler. I allowed my waitress to pick my beers ( I told her I liked light and ambers) and she did a decent job. I ended up enjoying the beer that came with a lemon slice.  The cheese curds were delicious, you can really taste the beer in the batter, and the poutine was ok. The gravy on the poutine was. Little chilled, but I stirred up the dish and it was good.  The steak was amazing - the only problem was that a million flies/gnats tried attacking my food when the steak came out (I highly doubt this would happen inside). Overall pretty delicious! I couldn't tell if it was wheelchair accessible because the only bathrooms I found were downstairs."}
{"text":"I dig the Dane.  It isn't necessarily a place to absolutely rave about, but when I'm downtown, I gladly eat & drink here.    Good brews, and good food.  Mainly I like the Dane for providing a comfortable atmosphere where I can have some high-end pub food, some Wisconsin suds, and play pool.    There is a burger here, topped with bratwurst, topped with bacon & served on pretzel bread.  For that reason alone the Dane is getting 4 stars."}
{"text":"A very nice brew pub indeed. I was able to try two of their beers on my visit. The scotch ale was delicious. The IPA on the other hand was an empty shell with no depth in flavor or complexity. I asked for a description like a real beer snob before I ordered and the bar tender was unable to speak to it, wish I would have taken that as a sign.   The worst part about our experience was while we were waiting for a table for dinner. The hostess tried several different buzzing notification thingys before she found one that \"worked\" and said it would be about 30 minutes. 45 later I go up to check on the table to which she says my thing must have been broken, I'll seat you right away. I glanced down at the list to see a good 5 or so tables seated before us. Wish they would have tried at least walking around the waiting area once to see if we were still waiting. Didn't even get an apology.  Now that I'm finished with my rant, I must say the food was great. We had the Imperial Fish Fry on recommendation from a friend, and it was awesome. It was cheaper than their Friday fry specials and they serve it daily."}
{"text":"What a great brewpub! I was in Madison for 10 days, and I somehow became the Duke, ha.   My favorites included the Scotch Ale (surprisingly very drinkable), Double Dubbel (comes in a bomber, MY FAVORITE over all of them), and their Kolsch. Fantastic stuff. If you're fan of lighter, wheat beers, the Hefeweizen and Crop Circle Wheat are good choices - many of my friends enjoyed those.   In general, the beers and alcoholic drinks are reasonably priced. I got a pretty tasty Long Island here as well. The food is yum, and there's loads of seating indoors and out.   Until next time, Dane."}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night and there was definitely an afterwork crowd getting together for some drinks.  It was pretty loud inside, but when you are eating with a 2-year old that isn't all that bad.  For once our son wasnt the loudest person in the place.  the wait staff was extremely nice.  I really liked the decor, great old-time bar feel.   Like many in here, I would say the beers were great.  They had something like 12 beers on tap!!  The food was pretty good too.  My wife and I both had burgers, texecana and the applewood smoked bacon cheeseburger.  They were decent, nothing extraordinary.  A little on the expensive side at $9.   I probably would have given Great Dane 3 1/2 stars, but alas, Yelp likes whole numbers!  If you are looking for a place to go and drink some beers this would be a great option.  I would also recommend it if you are going for a bite to eat and a beer, but I think that there are better burger options in Madison."}
{"text":"The Great Dane is always a solid, consistent spot to grab bar food when in Madison.   I went on Saturday night around 8 and was told there would be a 30 minute wait. I put my name in and gave the hostess my phone number. By the time I had ordered my drinks at the bar, my table was ready! Talk about fast service.   When we got to the table our waiter informed us that they were unfortunately out of mac and cheese for the night. I LOVE the mac and cheese at The Great Dane so I was somewhat bummed by this news, but this restaurant has so many delicious options so I knew I could find something else that I would enjoy.   I ended up going with the Mayan Chicken Wrap and my friend got the Cajun Chicken Sandwich. We both had out sandwiches with fries and enjoyed each bite. Each sandwich was about $10 each. So to be up by the Capitol in Madison on a Saturday night, this is a very affordable place to dine. In addition, during the summer they have a back patio/beer garden opened for guests. If you are headed to The Great Dane earlier in the evening, I recommend asking for a spot back there!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location now on two separate occasions and have been pleasantly surprised both times. The restaurant itself is very large and has a great atmosphere and engaging staff. The most recent visit was during a very busy lunch hour where we were seated immediately and had a great view of the extensive beers available.    For food I had the grilled vegetable sandwich with a side of fries. The sandwich was spectacular consisting of multiple grilled veggies with cheese on a large gourmet crispy bread. The side of fries was also well seasoned and just the right amount to go with the sandwich. My wife had a vegetarian soup which she thoroughly enjoyed.  Although we didn't get to enjoy any beverages the beer list was extensive and we look forward to going back for dinner. For vegetarians the menu is clearly demarcated with vegetarian options which are extensive and we look forward to trying more in the future."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and had the pub burger with sweet potato fries. The fries were okay (I prefer them a little less well done) and the burger was medium-rare, which is exactly what I ordered. We sat in a booth by the brewing equipment. It was an easy place to stop for a quick dinner after a long day in a party of 4."}
{"text":"Had the most amazing and bizarre grilled cheese here with gouda cheese, avocado and tomato on a tasty tomato basil roll. Delectable! Their 4 beer sampler was just right too since I wanted to try more than one craft brew. Very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Came here with my SO and our friend that was visiting. I have never been here although I live just around the block, so we decided to finally try it. We came on a game day so it was packed at the bar area and around it. We did have to wait a bit to get seated because it was the dinner rush, but once we did our waitress was very courteous. I can't remember specifically which burger I ordered for the life of me, but it came with a creamy sauce that was to die for. My SO ordered a bacon burger and both of them were great, no complaints here. The only downside is that the food took a while to come out and I had finished more than half my drink by the time it arrived. Our waitress was also rushing around so much that I never got a drink refill until I was done with my burger."}
{"text":"Always fun at the Great Dane! Nice laid back crowd with very friendly hosts, waitstaff and bartenders. Great place to play pool or watch a game. So many beers to chose from. The Great Dane also has excellent food. (FYI: each location has some different food options so you have to try each location to experience it all!) Most recently I got the spinach artichoke bread bowl and asked for all veggies instead of chips. They hooked me up!"}
{"text":"This place deserves a response to a lowly two-star review from my dad, Michael H.  The only part of his review to take note of is my good taste.  Yes, it might be crowded, and yes it WILL be noisy.  The floors will probably be sticky.  BUT, this is a Wisconsin micro-brew pub!!!  I'd be shocked if it wasn't ever crowded and noisy.  The beer is great, and they add new seasonal offerings enough to keep even the regulars trying new beers.  Try the crop circle wheat or their porter.  Growlers to go is also a nice way to save some cash.  The food is actually pretty diverse and satisfying.  The fish fry and burger served on a pretzel roll are both well-done and remind you that you're in Wisconsin.  The beer bread is fresh, and the honey butter it comes with is tasty.  Yet another thing I like about the great dane is the entertainment it offers.  Shuffleboard.  Where else can you play shuffleboard?!  I love that game.  They also have pool, darts, and some deer hunting games for those pure-bred wisconsonites that can't go 20 minutes without shooting an animal.  All games are free on sundays.  Happy hour deals are nice as well.  Enjoy the homemade beer with some friends over a game."}
{"text":"Have always been a fan. My go-to whenever I go to eat dinner with a family member or friend, and now my go-to whenever I come back to visit. I like the one by Hilldale Mall a lot better than the one on the Capitol Square because there's a lot more space.   Comfort food is what you'll find here...and comfort in general - you'll get more comfortable with the more beers you try. :)  My favorite dishes are the meat loaf and the smothered and covered chicken. (both fairly salty by the way - but the good salty...the kind of salty that makes sense). And if I'm feeling ambitious, the beer sampler. Sometimes it's a hit or miss with the meat loaf - most of the times I've ordered it it's been perfect and juicy. A few times it was a little dry, but just let them know and they fix it for you - how they fix it I do not know...."}
{"text":"Great Dane is a great pub if you're looking for a good variety of custom brews and good atmosphere, however, I was a little oversold on this place based on the other Yelp reviews and personal recommendations from friends.   I did a sampler of several of their custom brews, including the County Cherry, Peck's IPA, Old Glory APA, Super Red, Speedway IPA and the Crop Circle Wheat.  Loved being able to do a sampler flight and try and bunch of the beers, so this is the way to go in my opinion.  Double vote for the County Cherry if you're looking for something different.  The food was pretty average.  I thought it was going to be way better, so this is really the reason for the 3 star review.  The food was good, not great, and the frustrating part was that it would only take a tiny bit of effort to really make the food stand out.    I ordered the Wisconsin mac and cheese, and it was good.  Wish they had loaded up a ton of extra cheese on top, then baked it for a few minutes - then it would have been killer.  My friend ordered the Great Dane burger, which has artichoke dip on it instead of cheese, and he said it tasted like cream cheese on top and wasn't very flavorful.   The bottom line is that this is a great place for atmosphere and beer, but has pretty average pub fare.  I'd recommend going elsewhere for dinner, then spending the latter part of your night sampling the delicious brews of Great Dane."}
{"text":"For me, my visit to The Great Dane was sort of like going to a movie and enjoying the popcorn more than the film. I enjoyed the ever loving christ out of my bratburger. I could taste slight char on the brat patty and the burger patty and it was fan-freakin'-tastic.   Of course, the only thing better than a great burger is washing down that great burger with a beer right?  And that's where I caught the Dane woofin'. I first ordered a bitter on cask, which is not only one of my favorite beer styles but my favorite way to serve just about any style. Though I was happy that the beer was served at the proper temperature, it tasted sour ... as if it was either infected, or brewed with a sour mash. Whatever the case, it completely ruined the beer for me.  I tried a sip of my girlfriend's Mild ale and was saddened to see that it too was not free of blemish. The finish had quite a bit of diacetyl, and I'm definitely not a fan of buttery beers.   Fortunately the service was great. But as I implied before, I don't go to the movies for just the popcorn. In this case, I call the Great Dane's beer a flop."}
{"text":"I've always been to the Hilldale location and I love it - I've heard the downtown one is even better. Great pub-food. The chicken potpie is amazing. Nice outdoor seating at the Hilldale location"}
{"text":"this place is excellent! there is sometimes a long wait on the weekends, but it is well worth it. my husband and i have been here multiple times since our first time there, and it's taken me a long time to get anything but the mac and cheese. it's so damn good! and comes with a pretzel roll that is absolutely fantastic.   the last few times we went though, i've been trying some other menu items and the cajun chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries really knocks it out of the park too. highly recommended on even just the food menu, but the beer selections are also really good. overall, a great place with a great atmosphere. i especially love eating out in the garden in back! :)"}
{"text":"Food wise, I have had better. Nothing I've had on the menu across all the locations, including this \"flagship\" one, has impressed me in the least. I would equate the food to overpriced bar food trying way too hard to be more upscale than it actually is.  Beers on the other hand, that's a different story as I have yet to not like any of their brews. From seasonal to regulars, if you like beer, you should at least stop by a Great Dane location for beer alone. Sure, it's a bigger operation, but it's definitely better than the local brewpub in my hometown which seems to have a beer which is absolute crap every fourth or fifth brew on the list.   Basically: go for the beers, eat the food out of convenience."}
{"text":"Fabulous! The quality of the food and the service was exceptional! I was happily surprised to find vegetarian options on the menu--not just your run-of-the-mill fettuccine alfredo or house salad, but tasty Italian and Mexican dishes! I highly recommend the vegetarian portobello bake...and the crop circle wheat beer! :)"}
{"text":"Kitchen's open till 1am (?) on a Friday night. I came here to satisfy my late night food craving after a night at Merchant. Got the fried cheese curds which were of course delicious and unhealthy. I also ordered the pork belly bun which I was pretty surprised to see featured on the menu. They were no momofuku, but good enough for a joint in Wisconsin at 1 am! My food took a while to come, but I am a patient man, even when hungry -- I think they just had a barrage of food orders right before the kitchen closed."}
{"text":"Nice pub, great beer, nowhere to sit and the band was noisy. Food was ok for pub food."}
{"text":"The Mac n Cheese with sourdough breadcrumbs is out of this world. So creamy and warm and giant portions. Their in-house porter was also yummy. Big space and it was easy to grab a spot for four, even on a Saturday night. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I've been coming to the Great Dane for the last 17 years... since I turned 21. Always wonderful beer and my favorite appetizer, Tuna Tataki. Went in today after a little while and I heard they removed it after all this time. Why oh why?? It was sooo good! They have a Tuna Poke bowl with some other stuff but it's definitely not as good. Hopefully they bring it back :("}
{"text":"Their beer sampler is fun way to sample their good beers and have fun at the same time. I thought their fish fry was really good, too.  If you're going to dine there during warm month, try the pretty outside garden seating and make sure to share appetizer with friends for start of a nice evening to ensue."}
{"text":"My husband and a couple of family members ended up at The Great Dane for Thanksgiving. We were on the waitlist and we were delighted to get in. We have gone to the Hildale location numerous times for the Thanksgiving buffet but we never had the chance to try the Fitchburg location. It was amazing! We got in quickly and our server was very friendly even though it was a holiday and the place was packed to the gills.   The buffet itself is large. Several tables with anything you could ask for to eat. The prime rib was especially delicious? and the pie was wonderful too. Our server kept returning to check on us and refill our drinks. I was impressed with how friendly and upbeat all of the staff was. It was kind of a madhouse? in there but everyone kept their cool and good attitudes. They had a good selection of holiday favorites as well as some unexpected things. There was a delightful salad bar and many sides to choose from. We will be back for another holiday buffet!"}
{"text":"The West African Peanut Stew is absolutely delicious. I order it every time I dine here. The service is very good with attentive servers and bartenders."}
{"text":"Huge menu, huge beer list. This was our second visit here and it's a great stop if you are visiting Madison. We were in Wisconsin, so hit up a couple spots looking to beer flights. I love that you can create your own and add as many as you want. We decided to go crazy and try every singe beer, and had a really fun line-up of 14 or so beers on our table to go through. The food was solid, reasonably priced, decent service. It was super crazy on a Saturday afternoon with a long wait. If you can visit in warmer weather the beer garden in the back is also wonderful."}
{"text":"While you can't argue with the delicious brews, the service and comfort has lacked at this Dane location for several years now.  A few years ago, some friends and I made our first New Year's Eve stop at this downtown Dane. Not only was it ridiculously crowded, there was absolutely no additional seating available nor barely any standing room save right up next to the dj. Understandable, it was New Year's. But the service was worse. Two young, female bartenders were the only staffers available around 9pm. They were slow, to the extent of several beers taking almost fifteen minutes to be served. Shortly afterward, we noticed the only customers being served were handsome young men. Thankfully, we had a few of those with us, which is the only reason I'm certain we ever received our second round. We left shortly thereafter.  I gave it another few go's the past several years, but again, each time served disappointment. The beer was fantastic. The food was great. The service and setting were less than adequate. One summer evening last year, I met a friend for a drink in the basement, which was so hot and humid we had to leave. Another time more recently, the young waitress took so long my friends and I left after one drink.  The beer is the draw to the downtown Dane, but if you're able to hit another location, I recommend it. Hilldale or Fitchburg are bigger, better staffed, and haven't failed me yet."}
{"text":"Great time!!  It was packed so full on Friday night (nearly 2 hour wait) that we came back a bit earlier on Saturday night and waited a very pleasant chat-with-others-waiting 45 minuts...and well worth it.  Very nice selection of beer.  Friendly staff at every turn.  And for a bar-pub the food was very good.  Nice salad...spetacular chicken-pot-pie...delicious mac-n-cheese...nice price.  Not sure how often we'll have the pleasure of popping into Madison, but the Great Dane is on the \"do again\" list!"}
{"text":"I love getting small tastes of beer before committing to ordering a whole pint, so I really liked the option to get pretty much any number of 3 oz tastes for a reasonable price. They came out in a tray with numbered slots for the beer and a card that said which beer was which number, which I appreciated. I was impressed that they accommodated our group of ten on a Friday night pretty easily. I enjoyed the fried walleye - if anything, the only problem was that there was far too much food."}
{"text":"GD always is a good place to take (no more than 6) people. Super crowded place and if you have a huge party, good luck getting a seat without a reservation! Beer is pretty good too- a good variety available."}
{"text":"Good bites and good beer. A consistently good time. A great place to take visitors, as they have something for everyone."}
{"text":"This place is close to my friend's house, so I've ended up here a couple of times during visits to Madison.  It's a great neighborhood American joint- good house brews and decent food. Service has always been between ok and good, which is good enough for a place like this. The outside patio is comfortable and has a good atmosphere. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"My favorite time of year, here, is summer. You can sit outside at their beer garden and enjoy the Wisconsin warmth. Now, I'm checking-in in January and still pleased- only dreaming of warmer weather. Lol The service today was great and I'm trying the quesadillas for the first time. They are a little spicier than I'd prefer, but I'm also a wimp to spicy food. Like, Taco Bell mild sauce is spicy to me. Ha! Other than my mouth a little peppery, the food is good! A definite stop if your a local or tourist visiting from out of town!"}
{"text":"It's only ok for me. I've had better beers and better food. People look at this place as a Madison staple, but if you are going to go, I would only go fro drinks. The food is fine if you go in with low expectations, it's just nothing special and there are plenty of better dining options that are a short walk from this place."}
{"text":"I'd a given it 5 stars but there were a lot of peeps in there wearing hideous Badger crap!  Just kidding, its a great Brew pub with really good food.  Huge selection of beers.  I actually tried the full sampler and let me tell you 18-20 different kinds to try (I can't remember exactly how many :p) mostly all good and a few damn good (Texas IPA was great).  Stay away from the pepper beer, horrid horrid heartburn!  plenty of space as there is a great patio out back that has a great garden ambiance too it.  A must visit if ever in Madison."}
{"text":"Fantastic bar. Great beer selection. Best wings in town hands down. Service is friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Dear God. Whatever you do, do not order the Habenero buffalo wings. I've never seen four grown men get their asses kicked so bad. It was painful to watch.   Our waitress was a sweetheart though and bought the \"winner\" of their lame, lame wing-eating contest a pint of beer. Seriously? He finished one full Habenero wing."}
{"text":"Delicious wings (3-alarm is reasonably spicy, and i didn't dare venture into Habanero Hellfire) and the service was truly remarkable. Eleanor anticipated all of our needs, dealt with our large group well, and was funny to boot. I also liked all the beers I tried, especially the Red."}
{"text":"This place is great for sports. Our waitress was awesome. She was super attentive and accurate. This place also has a beer tab on the table. So many things to choose from on the menu. I wasn't able to decide what was good. I ended up going with the smothered fried chicken. It was soooooo good. Great flavor at a great price. I'm going to go back this week."}
{"text":"Yummy ass food and a great patio. The burger had a too much bun to burger ratio, but everything else we've ever gotten here are awesome. Love the environment Ps, did I mention the awesome patio.   Keep it up"}
{"text":"My first experience in Madison, WI. Okay, so it was a very snowy and very, very cold day in Madison when I had arrived. My flight was delayed due to the fact that the airport was still plowing the runways. I checked into my garbage hotel and asked where I could get something to eat. The Great Dane was still open, he exclaimed. Whatever. I walked into the loneliest looking bar I had ever seen. Granted it was after midnight, but still, no one was there, the bartender was already cleaning up and the place didn't close for a couple more hours.  I asked for a menu. He said only the late night menu was available. I discovered that meant an assortment of cheeses done various ways. Do you like fried cheese balls? How about boiled cheese curds? Mac and Cheese? Get the idea? I didn't realize this was Wisconsin, cheese, dairyland, etc. Okay, so I am slow sometimes, it was cold. Anyway, I ordered the Mac and Cheese. They must have felt that the carb quotient was not high enough, so they threw a soft pretzel on top. ??? The pretzel was the best part of the dish. This is a brewery. So I figured, I needed a beer. I told the bartender to surprise me. He was not in the mood. He wanted to know what kind of beer did I like. I told him Heinekin. He presented me a shot glass of something, asked me to taste it. Oh yeah, beer. Let's be honest, beer is beer. I know, there are some that claim to know differences, like wine, sure. Beer is beer and wine is wine. You might swirl that stuff in your mouth and tell me about the oaky flavor, but that is as believable as the person who smokes a cigar and talks about the chocolate undertones. Eat a chocolate cigar, there are chocolate undertones. If you want a runny bowl of garlicky macaroni and cheese topped with a pretzel, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Love the GD. Food is always good, service is fast. Beer is hit or miss but the Oktoberfest is awesome! The ginger ale is too!"}
{"text":"Went here for Easter Dinner with our family, we picked up our daughter and bf in Madison after 3 hour drive from Chicago. Had the $15 lamb dinner, my wife and I ordered this after having the last two years and loving the lamb....But all stopped here !..This year some braniac decided to serve cut up sliced lamb medallions instead of the usual nice slab of lamb filet that we used to compare to being served a great piece of prime rib!....Needless to say we were both still hungry after eating,( my wife is 120 lbs/5'7\" & me 165 lbb- 5'9\") the teasponful of caulifower and two potato medallians didn't cut the mustard....The filler roll doesn't count either....Note to mgnt: Please return to the standard way you used to serve lamb, If you have to, charge me an extra $3 more and serve us an Easter lamb meal....especially if you are going to charge $15 per plate for a tasting.....We will be back!!!!!...Please no more lamb medallions!.....Say CHEAP! CHEAP!!!.....Not cool....Sorry because we really love this place...still left 20% tip...server was terrific!!!......fodd was still tasty but please go back to way Easter lamb was meant to be!!!......Also my son loved his bacon burger and I thought mashed potatoes were amazing,.....that is the side I would I gave you with the lamb...WOW....flavor!!!....and the others had a good meal with their heouvos eggs and some brais sandwich"}
{"text":"I love the friggin Great Dane.   I adore the tuna burger (which is not available at their Fitchburg location).  I have tried absolutely everything a pesco-vegetarian can eat here, and I can safely say 80% of the fare available is quite memorable and wonderful.   I also must mention the spinach and artichoke dip which is heavenly.  For the past few summers they have featured a watermelon beer (garnished with a slice of watermelon) which is both unique and thirst quenching.  I'm a huge fan of the Crop Circle Wheat and Devil's Lake Red Lager. (I'm also a huge fan of getting a flight of beers when I go here, as I can never decide exactly what I want.)   Expect crowds and waits for tables on weekends during regular dining hours. During those times, expect large crowds by the bar too as everyone else is thirsty while waiting for their table."}
{"text":"Great place to eat after a long drive. They have a few rotating taps which was also nice. The food was good but the best part was definitely the tomato mushroom bisque. It was delicious. Our waiter was very friendly and pointed out his favorites on the menu when we had questions."}
{"text":"Went to the Great Dane on a weeknight with a friend. It was excellent. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was laid back and easygoing. We sat out in the patio, and it was cute. We were surrounded by ivy and flowers and it made the meal a little more cozy. The prices were very inexpensive but the food is still delicious. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great meal, great service, and great atmosphere in the outdoor cafe, under the ivy.  Everyone in my group enjoyed their meal.  The specialty beers were excellent."}
{"text":"Your typical brew pub with a respectable beer selection and a solid pub food menu (burgers, nachos, cheese curds, etc).  Service was receptive and always made sure our glasses were full.  What more can one ask for when in need of beer and a burger?"}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks and a appetizer.  The boneless chicken wings with honey spice sauce were amazing.  Some of the best cheese curds you can get in Madison.  Bartender was on point with service and mixed some great drinks.  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great brewery with great food. Great beer to choose from with a large menu. Staff was very pleasant, restaurant wasn't too loud and thereis a billiard hall connected with tv's, a bar, games and pool.    Great place to go and hang out."}
{"text":"Looked good had lots of bar games but service was sub par and food did not taste fresh at all. Friend got cubana and tasted really stale. I got the burger and looked awesome but no flavor on the burger. Sad part is my friend that got the cubana only had one bite and because we had 4 different servers coming to us no one even noticed to ask what was wrong. Great view but probably won't be back. They weren't even that busy we went around 8 pm last night :(. Other friend got the sausage plate and he liked that"}
{"text":"Cheese curds and poutine w/ pork belly were amazing! I got the steak and i thought it was very good for a more casual, prewbub-type place. I went with a group of six and everyone was very pleased with what they ordered. Definitely recommend this place if you are stopping by Madison."}
{"text":"Love the selection of beers and bartenders. Food is typical bar food but always comes out fresh and hot."}
{"text":"We had fun here late Sunday night of Memorial Day Weekend. Played pool and drank some beers. Very spacious place, really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I would consider this place to be one of my favorite places to go in Madison. The food is great, the service is probably the fastest I have ever seen in Madison (which is saying something for a town with some of the best service I have seen in many places)  and the beer is delicious. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good, safe restaurant with predictably excellent food and beer."}
{"text":"Oh hey Great Dane.  Some people call me a Great Dane! I like your space! Your rooms! Your games! Haven't yet found a beer I dig but I'm still exploring, still leaning about your hoppy offerings. The fact that you were the only place one Saturday night had a deck of cards in the Capitol means you have a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, great service! Andrew was our server and was excellent! Food and beer were amazing, as well. Will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"I fucking love this place so much I had my damn wedding reception here (well, their Fitchburg location--but this is the one I usually frequent).  The food is pretty impressive across the board, especially for the price point.  This place is Husband's and my typical date night.  The waitresses are super cute.  The bartenders are super nice.  There's a walled-in outdoor patio that's swimming in low-lit ambiance in the warmer months (which basically means any time it's not snowing--this is Wisconsin, after all).  The only time I've *ever* had anything resembling bad service here (with ~monthly visits for the last couple years) is the one time some waiter refused to get my buddy a bloody Mary sans horseradish because \"it's a mix.\"  Bro.  Seriously.  Someone makes that mix--this is a freakin' brewpub, it doesn't come out of a bottle.  Buddy's girlfriend went to the bar and the bartender made him the aforementioned horseradish-free bloody without batting an eye.  I've never seen that waiter again.  Good.  Five stars, hands down."}
{"text":"I'm trying to catch up on yelping places that I've been to so many times that they clearly rate very high in my estimation.  \"The Dane\" is surely one of those.  In my twelve years serving as a city commissioner for Madison, I spend many a Monday night with friends hanging out at the Dane for a few beers and some conversation, spend at the end of the bar where a special fold-down table was installed for my friend Dave Schaefer.  Rest in Peace, Schaefy!  The Dane offers (IMHO) the best in-house brewed beers in Madison, though the competition is constantly on the increase.  What they've really got going for them, beside the beer, is very decent pub food, something some of the competition simply misses the mark on.  Conveniently located just a block off the capitol square, this is a great place for a great pint of beer, a sandwich or meal, and it is also easy to find some good conversation.  Last I knew, they also offer free WiFi to customers, and the bartenders have always been easy-on-the-eye regardless of your orientation.  Dane, I love you, and your great people too!"}
{"text":"I was in Madison last weekend for a Wednesday.  On Friday night there was a welcome reception, and afterwards a large group of out of town people wanted to go out.  Our of the locals in the group was an awesome guide and managed to get 20 so strangers to 2 cool bars.  We walked from the Hilton to the bar next door for a coffee shot, then came here to chill.  Upstairs has a bunch of games and feels like a fun sports bar.  Downstairs is more quiet and chill and has a bunch of seating.  They have a lot of beer on tap.  Other people loved he beer, and enjoyed trying a lot of different good house made brews.  I don't drink beer, so I got a cider which wasn't house made.  I got a plate of fries, which was a good size and very tasty and not expensive.  I liked that you can see the tanks where they are brewing.  (I don't like to drink beer, but I love to see it being made).  I like that different rooms here have completely different vibes."}
{"text":"I figured it was time for an update...to report on the consistently high quality of service, food, and ambiance delivered by the folks here.  My most frequent form of visit is to treat myself to an occasional work lunch, usually eaten in the bar area, and do some reading.  I have always received friendly, warm, and attentive service from the folks.  It's a really nice refreshing escape from a stressful workday....my menu/food selections vary but, some of my favorites are the Tuna Rolls, green chili, spicy peanut stew, Reuben, or the fallafal.  But, be still my beating heart...I've ignored the menu too long...and failed to notice/forgot about the meatloaf....until.....  and it was SO YUMMY on such a cold day....a very generous slab of meatloaf, first baked, then heated on the grill....a generous serving or baby red mashed potatoes, green beans, and a mountain of onion strings....who knew you could get all four food groups in such a delicious package...meat, vegetable, carbs, and deep fried :)  HUGE portion....I have left overs  hint:  If you do come in a group, at lunch time, expect to wait, especially on Thursday or Friday....come a little earlier, and consider sitting in the bar.  Also, check the upstairs bad...it's a little different but, same great menu and service!"}
{"text":"So...time for an update.  I work near this location, so I come here often for lunch or dinner.  In addition, I travel a lot, and have been to numerous other types of establishments.  Take home messages:  - the staff are GREAT at the Great Dane.  Whether spending 30 minutes talking shop with the brew meister, or just chatting with the bartenders and staff....the folks here are so friendly, laid back, and frankly, fun to talk to.  There have been many a day, bad at work, come for lunch and a beer, end up socializing, and leave feeling rejuvenated and upbeat.  - the beers?  good to great.  I do NOT expect GREAT beer with every batch, variety, or brew.  Beer is a living thing, subject to temperature, climates, humidity, weather...even going back to the conditions under which the hops and malt were grown, as well as how sensitive the yeast is.  These guys brew really damn good beer, and true to how beer should be brewed...GREAT ingredients, with true yeasts.  Cheers!  - ambiance - what more is there to say?  this is THE place to be.  From wacky, to straight laced, from old school woodwork and bar, fun games, great sports selection on TV, and, dare I say, the prettiest and most friendly wait staff around!  Just.  Plain.  Nice.  :)  - Food:  The menus change, and go through rotation.  Classic pub fare, to healthy choices (try the tuna sushi roll salad..it's new, and damn, home made rolls...maybe not THE BEST...but, damn good for home made!)  always something nice.  Hey guys, if you read this, bring back the lamb....just saying  :P  - dedication to what is \"Wisconsin\"....hell yeah.  from work ethic, to ownership, to local brews, to everything wonderful about our state....this IS Wisconsin.  There is a reason this place is SO CONSISTENTLY busy busy busy....  hint:  it is busy during dinner and weekends....accept it, and roll with it...either plan on waiting or...jaunt upstairs...there is plenty of seating there, too."}
{"text":"I am always on the lookout for good local beers, and on a recent trip to Madison I learned about the Great Dane Pub & Brewing Company so I decided at some point during my trip I was going to have to make a stop.   I arrived one evening with a coworker and we decided that we wanted to sample some local beer and have a good meal. This place was pretty busy for a week night, which is usually a pretty good sign, however we didn't have to wait long for a table. Once seated we looked over the menu and immediately decided on starting off with an order of Cheese Curds, however these curds were somewhat of a disappointment. There really wasn't too much taste, and I almost felt like they came out of a box from the freezer.  For my main entree, I decided to go with the New London Fish Fry, which was haddock fillets dipped in the a Pilsner batter served with tartar sauce, lemon, Kohl slaw and fries. Overall the fish was great, crispy, flakey, and delicious. I paired my meal with one of their own beers, the Crop Circle Wheat which was very good and had a great taste.  Overall I was pleased with my visit to the Great Dane Pub, the staff was nice and friendly. The food was good, nothing exceptional, The beer was cold and delicious, however I wasn't as impressed with this place as I had hoped. If you are looking for a decent meal, with a locally made craft been then I recommend making the stop. Otherwise I actually prefer The Old Fashioned just down the street."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Better than average service. Outstanding beer!  I love going to the Great Dane when in Madison!"}
{"text":"The Great Dane is one of my go-to's whenever I'm in Madison.  This place is a great brew pub right near the Capitol building, and it gives off quite the 'college town pub' vibe without being obnoxious.  As one might expect, their brews are excellent: they always have a good variety for whatever type of beer you like, and they always have different things to try.  Most of the food (again, typical college town/Wisconsin vibe), is full of cheese and other things that aren't good for you, which makes them incredibly delicious.  On my last visit I tried the honey pepper salmon club, which was a bit disappointing (perhaps that's my fault for not getting something fried and/or cheesy, lol).  The salmon, despite being advertised as coming with a mayonnaise, was quite dry.  The bun seemed overly large for the piece of salmon, which didn't help with the dryness issue, either.  The service was also a little on the slow side, but we did go during a Badger game so I know our server was quite busy.  Overall, I'm willing to overlook what I'm guessing was an outlier experience, and I'd go back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of brewery restaurants... they always have the best food. This place was no exception. My boss and I came here for dinner during our business trip, and we wanted to try a place that was unique and unlike what we could try back home.  While we waited for a table, we sat in the bar area and had a beer. He and I both ordered the Crop Circle Wheat, which the waitress said was like Blue Moon. I'm pretty picky when it comes to beer, but it was quite good. Once we were seated, we saw just how huge the menu was. It took us a while to decide what to order. We knew we wanted to try fried cheese curds... I mean, when are we ever going to be able to try them again except in a place like this? And holy cow they were yummy. They were super crunchy and rather addictive. I'm not a fan of ranch dressing, but apparently it's a pretty popular dip. They were perfectly fine on their own.  My boss ordered the prime rib with cheddar mashed potatoes (which were great, by the way), while I decided to get their Wisconsin style cheddar mac n' cheese. Noticing a pattern with our ordering yet? When in Rome... My mac n' cheese was absolutely delicious. The sauce was thick and creamy, and it was topped with sourdough bread crumbs. It was a ton of food, so I couldn't finish it (even with my boss helping me).  Needless to say, I'm a huge fan of this place. I guess it's a good thing they don't have a location in Florida, because I'd gain a lot of weight if I ate like this all the time :)"}
{"text":"We came here with no expectations as we have been to other locations in Madison, but wow... we really enjoyed ourselves here.  First off, we noticed a TON of families here with their kids. For us, that is a good sign.  Secondly, the beer selection was pretty nice and I was able to find a few beers that I could really enjoy. Third, the food was outstanding!! The portion sizes were just right and so darn tasty!!  Our daughter enjoyed her grilled cheese sandwich and fries. We liked it so much we had take out from there the next day. Although the food was good we questioned the containers they put the food in.  The previous day we took leftovers back to the hotel and they gave us a nice sturdy paper/cardboard based packaging.  For the carry out they put the food in flimsy clear plastic containers best suited for salads, not hot meals.    Regardless of that hiccup with the carry out (I only hope it was anyway!), we will definitiely go back if we are in the area."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this brew pub. I had a burger and it was great and the beer selections is fantatsic.  I would eat here again!"}
{"text":"I stopped here because I heard a lot of great things about their beer. I have to say I was a bit disappointed, I wasn't a fan of heir style of beer."}
{"text":"At least they improved their menu, but it's some place, if I was by myself, would never go out of my way to go to. The food is good, but the employees seem very cliquey, I guess if you're type of the histper kind, I can see it."}
{"text":"Having just flown into town for the first time, we wanted to try some typical Wisconsin food, specifically brats.  The Great Dane was a good place for this.  It has a good atmosphere inside, perfect for a brew pub- lots of wood and traditional design elements. First, I really regret not having a beer.  What kind of person goes to a brew pub to have a brat and doesn't get a beer!  That dumb move aside, the food was pretty good.  The pretzel rolls had some great mustard dips to accompany them, and the brats and mashed potatoes were very well done- exactly what i was looking for.  Some of the other menu items seem a bit more eclectic as far as brew pub sandwiches go, but I i would guess that has a lot to do with catering to the nearby college population."}
{"text":"Adorable atmosphere, some of the best chest curds ever, and the most amazing ranch Ive ever had in my life! I could bathe in it!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a staple restaurant that we bring friends to who do not live in Madison. I've been to this particular location for Sunday Brunch and for dinner. It's an unusually long wait time to get a table here, but that's my own lesson learned to utilize their reservation tool online!   3 stars because the food is sub par and I'll probably return to try something else out.  Tip: Get a sample of any beer in a 4 oz glass for under $2!"}
{"text":"Two words: Fish Fry.  Okay, maybe it's not so special for Midwesterners, but for a SoCal girl like me it was a thing of beauty.  The same cannot be said of my boyfriend's burger that featured a brat patty, bacon and cheese on a pretzel bread bun.  It was comical to look at but the same cannot be said of the aftermath."}
{"text":"Tried the pub burger with sweet potato fries and shared 2 orders of cheese curds. Great, comfy vibe and really quick service. Cheese curds were delicious and not too greasy, and the burger was thick and fresh. I like my sweet potato fries to be crispier, but overall they were fine!"}
{"text":"We're in town for a college roomie's wedding, so we stopped in for some dinner, drinks, catching-up. Had a great time.  The buffalo burger, sweet potato fries, and hot applesauce hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I'd say that the restaurant proper has above standard pub food. Burgers, sandwiches, and some pretty upscale dinner options for a reasonable price.   The reason for 3 stars is that I have yet to recieve reliable service. Most recently, a friend and I went for dinner on a Wednesday. It was a little busy, there was some kind of party upstairs. You'd think with a loud party going on they'd sit us downstairs, but you'd be wrong. So, it was loud and for some reason they had exactly one server for the entire section, so part of it wasn't even her fault, it's poor management. So, understandably it was slow service. The problem came with the food. My friend's food was so over seasoned that neither of us could have more than a bite. It wasn't spicy as in hot, it was spicy in that it felt like someone just dumped a couple of season bottles on it and called it a day. Our server was busy, so we couldn't really flag them down. I went to the bar to get someone's attention. Someone else came, and just took her plate without actually finding out what was wrong, or what the fix was. Eventually our actual server came back, and my friend got a meal that was better, and what she wanted. At no point did a manager come by. On our way out the door, we tried to tell the hosts what had happened, and again it went pretty not great. A manager even walked by in the middle of our talk, and completely ignored us.   So, I won't say don't eat here, because the food is good, but maybe go to a different location if you have the time."}
{"text":"Don't miss this gem of a \"beer garden\" in Madison. The best seat in the house takes a  little effort to find. Skip the bar and pool hall, go downstairs and through the rathskellar...you'll pop out into a Wonderland.  The menu rocks, service is way friendly with a smile (we loved Elise and Joel)...the beer bread and honey butter is delish."}
{"text":"Of the places we visited in Madison, this was my favorite.  Everything here was so darned good.  The ladies serving up the tasty food were so nice.  I had the sausage plate and it was wonderful.  The sausages were very well made and spiced.  The kraut and potatoes were savory goodness.  I wish I had a beer, but I was traveling on business and so did not partake.  My traveling companion had the chicken pot pie and said that it was delicious.  I will come back again when I am in town and maybe I will try the beer."}
{"text":"My friend took me here after I flew in.  We shared the fried cheese curds, calamari, and crab raviolis.  The fried cheese curds hit the spot.    The staff was friendly and provided good service."}
{"text":"The food was a cut above. You can really tell they are allowing the culinary team to be creative with the ingredients and recipes and it is paying off. Beer of course was spot on and I look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and it seems like they tend to screw up my order about 50% of the time.  I was just there with a few people, and everyone else got their food then our waitress walked away, and I had to ask about my food.  Which she didn't come around until everyone was nearly done eating, I politely suggested that I would like something quick so I could eat my meal, but they brought the wrap anyways (Which was a small amount of chicken in it), after everyone else was done.  I just asked for a box, the check and paid full price.  Not pleased at all with this experience, I'm sure this will be the last time I have dinner there."}
{"text":"A brew pub with good beer and consistently good food."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided that we wanted to get some nachos and beer last night because we haven't seen each other in a while.   First, with many open tables available, the hostess put the three of us in the very back of the giant seating place by the windows. It would have been fine, but being the cold rainy day it was; it made our dining experience a little worse.   Secondly, we felt our server needed a little more training when it came to beer and mixed drinks she didn't know a lot about it. We specifically came to the Great Dane for their beer selection, and it was slightly discouraging. In addition, all the beers we tried tasted extremely water downed and could not get the full flavors of them. Since I love beer so much, I felt like I was getting cheated out of a quality beer experience.   But some positive aspects of the restaurant was the fact their large nachos were fantastic. It was able to fill 3 people up without anything else. There was plenty of cheese, beans, olives, and other goodies on there. Also, there's also an option for chicken on top of it.  Finally, there are bounty of parking spots around the area."}
{"text":"It's a great large space to go with a lot of people. The outdoor patio is amazing. However I don't particularly like the beer, it isn't very flavorful. But the service has always been great and I've never had a bad experience in that regard. The food a mediocre but I've only eaten the vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Thoroughly mediocre. Beer: mediocre. I got cheese curds and I don't know how they managed to make them so bland--they tasted like nothing. Even the side of Gorgonzola sauce I asked for was bland. How is this accomplished? Damn. This town sure serves up a whole lot of bland. I don't know what would motivate me to go here again. Maybe Geeks Who Drink trivia on Monday nights? Maybe."}
{"text":"A Madison classic.   Great beer, yummy food, a huge menu. Not a huge fan of the brunch, but they make up for it in everything else. Love that this location has lots of pool tables, bar space, and darts. Love that the menu has so many different things on it - and really yummy, high quality dishes for being a Wisconsin bar!   My favorites: Nachos, Sesame Tuna Salad, Curry Noodle Bowl, and of course, filling up a Growler!  EDIT: Not a fan of their brunch at all. Went to the Great Dane for New Years. So fun!"}
{"text":"How do you get excited about a dinner salad?  Tomatoes that taste like tomatoes, cucumbers that are firm, carrot & radish slices, & a great blue cheese dressing. The Texas Speed Bump IPA pours like an Irish Cream Ale. Great place - I will be back!"}
{"text":"General Thoughts: Good food, but a little pricey for what you get.  Some people may also be thrown off by the fact that they ONLY have Great Dane beer. No other beer. None. But hey there are LOTS to choose from and they have wine so that appeases me.  I've ordered the meatloaf and mashed potatoes there twice and it is always delightful and delectable. The service is always fantastic and they are usually pretty quick to bring out the food no matter how busy it is, and it does get busy.  The last time we ate there, I was SO pleased because the waiter sat us at least a table away on either side from other people. I just think that is so courteous. When it's not busy, I'd rather not be jammed in a corner with all 10 groups that are eating there at that moment. Our waiter was also super attentive, funny, and just all around awesome. I wish I could remember his name.  I would say the food is good. Not AMAZING but good. The bill is always a little more than I think the food was worth, but for a downtown destination with lots of seating, great service, and tons of beer I still think it's worth going there.  Definitely recommend especially to those Madisonites who are entertaining out of town guests.  Lastly - they have shuffleboard so... two thumbs up for that."}
{"text":"Beer, beer and more beer.  Eating?  What is that all about?  Eating just ruins the flavor of the beer.  I love the Emerald Isle Stout.  Not too hoppy with just the right IBU's to get a slight bitterness, but to allow the malt and barley to come right through."}
{"text":"We visited here while we were in town for a football game.  We met up with some local friends and had a great time!  They handled our large group very well and there was plenty of space for us to spread out and enjoy ourselves.    The beer was good, which you come to take for granted in Madison, and the food was good as well.  We tried the cheese curds which were good (can't say they were our favorites of the trip but a close second). My husband and I split the Sustaina-burger buffalo burger and side of mashed potatoes that was really delicious!  The bun for the burger was a multigrain ciabatta that really withstood the burger and toppings.  All the ingredients were fresh, locally sourced and you could really taste the difference.  Our waitress was very attentive even though it was a very busy day and was very pleasant.   Overall great spot for food, drinks and fun!"}
{"text":"We were here for a post rehearsal dinner party, great beer, delish mixed drinks, great for groups."}
{"text":"Is my favorite restaurant really a brewpub in Madison? YES!  I have never had something I don't like (the artichoke and cheese dip is a must).  I also love the dark wood atmosphere and the house brewed beers.  And the fact that it is in one of my favorite cities in America.  I always come here when in Wisconsin."}
{"text":"Went to Great Dane in Fitchburg for a brunch Sunday, not impress at all, way to expensive for the food they have on the menu and the buffet. Very standard quality and options. Then we tried the one by Hilldale hoping it would be better, but same thing, nothing special about their food and the buffet. Only good for a place to drink."}
{"text":"This was a good meal for a Saturday afternoon. It was a good family atmosphere. The service was slightly slow at the beginning of the meal, but once we got our food it made up for it. The poutine was very tasty, reminds me of trips to Canada."}
{"text":"The big ups: POUTINE. Not great poutine....but still poutine. Big space. They take your cell number if there is a wait and text you when you are up. Good idea.  The not so ups: Bones in my perch. Dim lighting provides and \"atmosphere,\" but everyone at the table, no matter their age, needed to use the flashlight capability on their phones to read the menu.  I ain't mad at it, but the company I was with was what made my visit here enjoyable."}
{"text":"I really liked the beer and patio seating here! Right when I got there, we got seated fairly quickly (for 4 people) and were able to order our drinks soon after. Our waiter recommended some beers to us, which was very well liked by my friends. It did take awhile to get our orders in, but our waiter was very apologetic and helpful for what we all wanted to order. I ordered their Baja turkey burger with mashed potatoes--the mashed potatoes weren't as good as I thought they would be, but over all the meal was good. I can definitely see myself coming back here to have drinks!"}
{"text":"First time at the downtown Madison locations. I've reviewed the Wausau WI location and have tried the other location in Madison but was excited to try out the downtown Madison Brew Pub. This location is set up to party. One bar faces several table games featuring full size pool tables and shuffleboard. It seems to have a more open layout that would better accommodate big crowds of people without troubling couples. If your looking to avoid a crowd the hidden basement bar is perfect. The next thing I noticed is that the beer menu was exactly the same as the other locations. I almost hoped that Mad Town would have a signature brew only found here. The menu seemed to also be incredibly similar and didn't feature noticeable differences. Still a fun place that brews a few great craft beers and some good old fashioned German plates that are worth trying."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Everything. I had oatmeal stout, bean and ham soup, and fish fry (haddock!). Simply superb."}
{"text":"The Great Dane is a solid, consistent, easy place to go for beer or food. I've been a few times since moving to Madison and I'm always pleased with the service and the meals.  The cheese curds are delish. I love the sauce that comes with. This is the place we take out-of-towners to introduce them to our new Wisconsin culinary delight. :) As others have said, it's kid- and family-friendly, which is also great when looking for a place for a group to eat. It's also nice for big groups or small events.   I really like the options on the menu here. I can pretend to be healthy by ordering a giant salad or wrap, or I can go all out and get wings or a burger. It really doesn't matter in the end anyway because I always get a beer or two! I'm never amazed by the food, but I'm also not disappointed. For me, that is ok when the Great Dane is the option that makes finding \"something for everyone\" so easy. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped here with a group of seven people after a recent Badger football game. Considering it was a game day, our wait was shorter than I expected.  Like most Brewpubs I've been to, The Great Dane has a HUGE menu. Everything from Soups, Sandwiches and Salads, to Burgers, to Mexican and even Cuban and African. I always fear that places that do this won't be able have consistently good food across the board. That is the exact situation here. Some of our food was good, some was great and some was (to use a Yelp term) just Meh.   The Great category would include both Soups I tried. My order of Tomato and Mushroom Bisque was a wonderfully unique combination with the flavors of Cream of Mushroom and Tomato Soup both coming through and nice texture from the Pretzel Croutons and Parmesan Crisps. The West African Chicken Peanut Stew was a flavorful combination of Chicken, Rice, Tomato and Spices with a savory hint of Peanut. The Brat and Bacon Pretzel Burger is basically Wisconsin on a plate, with a Burger, a Brat Patty, Bacon, Cheese and Mustard all on one Sandwich!  The Good Category would include my Mojo Cubano which had good flavor from the Pulled Pork, but wasn't pressed enough to create the wonderful texture of a traditional Cuban.  The Meh Category would include the Jerk Pork Tacos and The Mayan Chicken Wrap, both of which were described as, \"dry and flavorless\".  Service was friendly and efficient and The Great Dane is easily wheelchair accessible."}
{"text":"Let's just say, my mouth is watering from all these reviews.  Especially about the Brats and mash. Last time I went, my brother ordered just that and it was delicious. I ordered the fish (it was Friday, i had to!)   This place is great for the typical college student or older adult. Don't be fooled by this place and think you just have to order a hamburger, because after all, isn't that what brew pubs are all about...bar food? some beer and a burger? NO. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure the burgers are delicious! But open the menu and you will be surprised by all your choices. Try something new, go for it! (Vegetarian options too!)  Relaxing, comfortable environment (and large, but snug at the same time). Friendly staff. Great food (not to mention, large portions). I'll be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Service is great  Beer selection and quality of beer is wonderful  Food is ok.  Breakfast buffet is wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a sit down meal.... And eating outdoors was fun .... Wisconsin was great"}
{"text":"We stopped in for brunch on our way back home from the Dells after searching for good brunch spots along our route and reading the many positive Yelp reviews.  We were not disappointed!  The items offered on the brunch were diverse, amazing, and so fresh.  I was highly impressed with the quality of the salad bar and the seafood options that were available to pair it with.  My group enjoyed the typical breakfast fare of eggs, potatoes, french toast sticks, eggs benedict and bacon as well as the non-traditional taco/nacho station and oysters.  The pastries were great as well!  We were too full to try them, but the desserts offered looked delicious - ice cream, cookies, cake, pies!  We had a nice table outside, which was perfect for the hot, sunny day."}
{"text":"Average beer, average food. Their cheese curds sounded amazing on paper, but were very disappointing. Bad cheese curds in Wisconsin is kind of impressive. Also, they seem to advertise their root beer/cream soda/ginger ale as though it's house made, but they were all watered down and void of any real flavor. Our server mentioned the sodas are from a mix. Decent service at least."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Beer was a meh.  Service was not great and our order was not correct. There are better places."}
{"text":"Great Dane has average beer and average food... But the bars and the beer garden are awesome.  If you're looking for an outdoor place to have some beers, their beer garden is perfect.  They have amazing wings with some really good flavor options. The rest of their menu is just ok - it's not offensive, but I'd rather eat somewhere else downtown."}
{"text":"The Great Dane is definitely a place to check out in Madison (with multiple locations). They offer excellent options that you probably won't find elsewhere. The low country shrimp/andouille sausage/ham and cheddar grits is amazing! I also love their fried plantains! I've only had one entree that I didn't care for, the grilled cheese sandwich. However, they were more than happy to bring me a different dish. The two downfalls of their restaurant are that they can be very busy and the atmosphere very loud (people and music). Otherwise, definitely check it out for some great American and internationally-inspired food."}
{"text":"4 stars for the beer and patio.  Some beer incould drink all day. I especially liked the sessional tri-pepper Pilsner that has a robust meaty green pepper flavor...and I don't even like pilsners. This was unique and worth taking home. Next was the crop circle wheat with a lemon garnish. So good and refreshing for the summer. I also had the black earth porter and the Emerald Isle stout but nothing to write home about. I then had the hard Ginger ale and it was way too sweet.   Service is friendly but just ok - patio seems to get the short end of the stick on the weekends I guess. And we didn't try the good but it smelled excellent and noticed that it had a grass fed option.   Would come back to try more beer out in the patio  for sure."}
{"text":"The Dane may have great beer and a good atmosphere, but the food is borderline inedible.    The menu is far too large, first of all.  They have burgers...and hummus.  They serve Italian \"specialties\"...and beer and cheese soup.  No restaurant can pull this off and pull it off well.    During the Badgers game yesterday, we ordered chicken nachos.  I think that the chicken must have run through the nachos, because I couldn't detect a single piece of chicken in the mix.  The nachos were not good.    We also ordered hummus.  Three of us ate roughly 10% of the platter, it was that bad.    The waitress made no effort to ask us how things were--and it was not a busy time.    Service is generally okay, but wasn't yesterday at all.    Drinks and beer are fine here, but if you want to eat, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"First time patron of The Great Dane and I was super impressed with the service, servers and food. We were in a hurry (had tickets to a play) and they were accommodating and friendly! I was traveling on business to the area and everybody raved about this place. I was not disappointed.  I loved the cheese curds as they were not just fried string cheese.  When I'm back in Madison, I'll be here for sure!"}
{"text":"I love this place for many reasons: -Great memories -Eclectic menu -Good social gathering place -Cheese curds  Even before I lived in Madison, my Epic interviewer took me and the rest of the interviewees to the downtown location where we welcomed the warm, lively atmosphere and wide-ranging selections. The burgers/sandwiches, entrees, fried plantains, cheese curds have a delicious taste and no complaints. I've ordered that pork shoulder wrapped in banana leaf like 5 times before moving onto the brats and sauerkrat dish 3 more times. All the locations are pretty consistent in taste and service but the Fitchburg one was my favorite because of the ample parking lot and the roomy upstairs.   I will always recommend this place over The Old Fashioned. Sometimes you just don't have 2 hours to wait for a plate of food."}
{"text":"The quality of food & drink at this location has not decreased; however, other restaurants of this style in Madison (brewpub) have improved.  GD's rating goes down accordingly.  Overall, I would say their house beers are enjoyable, but none are knock your socks off.  The sustain-a-burger (local beef, greens) is my favorite menu item.  Go to the biergarten  (outdoor patio) if it's nice out.  Points for the shuffleboard and pool tables.  It's good, but GD has lost its status as \"great\" due to a continuing influx of breweries that are really innovative."}
{"text":"I really wish every town had a Great Dane!! For someone who doesn't always love the limited, greasy options that most bars and pubs tend to have, The Great Dane is a godsend. The menu is FULL of great food, beer, and cocktail options.   I ordered the African Peanut Stew and the fish tacos, while a friend got the shrimp and grits and poutine. Do yourself a favor and order that peanut stew!! The fish tacos were okay, the habanero-lime salsa that came with it was way too spicy but PRO TIP: ask for the milder salsa that comes with the other taco dish and they'll give it to you! I tried my friend's grits and poutine, both were delicious. The passion fruit beer I had didn't really taste like passion fruit but was good nonetheless. Our server was literally the sweetest in the world and food/drinks came out fast enough! I was very impressed by the variety of options on the menu and how they were \"culturally diverse\" (tacos, southern fare, etc). Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The Great Dane is a tried and true Madison favorite. My husband and I love the Great Dane downtown for its convenience and great atmosphere. Their food is always delicious and their menu has so much variety! My personal favorite side they offer is their fried plantains - pretty unique. We usually go for dinner but more recently just tried their fish fry and brunch. Their fish fry was incredible and had both comforting (fried of course) and healthy (broiled) options. Portions are very generous and all entrees are reasonably priced. Their brunch menu is also phenomenal. My husband had the Belgian waffles - huge portion and very fluffy and flavorful - while I had the huevos rancheros - so yummy! We also did not have to wait for a table unlike the specialty brunch spots in Madison. Give it a try especially if you're not wanting to wait for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Crowded but not overly loud.  We didn't try the food as we had dinner plans elsewhere but a nice place to have an informal gathering and enjoy some beverages.  We could still hold conversations, which was nice.  I didn't try any of the beers but the husband rather liked the Crop Circle Wheat, which came in a huge glass, and he also tried the Tri Pepper, of which I did have a sip.  A bit weird but not the worst thing I've ever had.  Good location, kind of odd layout as there are spots where it was hard to get around, and the bartender kept giving me diet cokes (yay for being the designated driver) so I was happy with the service.  Somewhere we would seek out again if we are back in the area!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Great Dane. I cannot speak for the beers since I do drink beer but I am very familiar with the food.  Appetizers:  The artichoke dip, fish tacos and tuna tataki are some of my favorites.  I often order either the tuna or the fish tacos as my lunch instead of as an app Food:  The brown ale onion soup is to die for!  Seriously, I have cravings for this soup!!!  I DREAM if this soup!  I also really enjoy the Texarkana burger (and I'm not even a burger person). My favorite sandwich has to be the salmon BLT-it is delicious!  My only disappointments have been the mac and cheese and the chicken pot pie.  Not because they were bad but because I can make them a lot better at home. The staff is always friendly and efficient.  The Hilldale Great Dane is also very accommodating for children. The hosts tend to put all the families with small children in the same section.  Good for the families with children and good for the diners who don't want to see/hear young kids.  As a side note:  the Great Dane brunch, while a bit pricey, is very good. It is also very busy so don't forget to make a reservation.  ;)"}
{"text":"I love the variety of beers and food. Great, friendly and helpful bartenders. Reasonable prices and fun ambiance make this a fav when I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"This place was busier than hell on a Saturday night, but we still managed to get seated at a booth pretty quickly. They've got an awesome beer selection with great variety. The food was tasty, with a nice combo of your general bar-food fare and fancier items. I really wish I had tried the Thai peanut stew, but I ended up getting the Black and Tan burger with a Boca patty. We also had fried cheese curds as an appetizer, and they didn't disappoint.  We also had our infant daughter with us, and instead of a high chair that would sit at the end of the table (there would be no room here for that), they had a special seat that clipped onto the table that we situated between us, and it worked wonderfully! I wish more restaurants would do this!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I was on the way home from a work trip and I had just napped in a parking lot nearby. I would have eaten the soles off of your shoes. Met a friend at the Great Dane, and upon walking through the door my perception changed. I had always pictured it as a generic brew pub along the lines of Rock Bottom, but this place is gorgeous. And HUGE. Sat at the bar, had the mac n cheese and exchanged barbs with the bartender (she was the best kind of snarky.). Had their imperial IPA and liked it a lot.  I'm really glad I took my friend's advice on this place and I'm sure I'll be back in the near future."}
{"text":"Huge variety, always well executed.  Good beers, good cheese curds, good price."}
{"text":"Had a 4 sampler of their beers and the peanut stew. The beers were good. The stew wasn't what I expected - basically spaghetti sauce over rice - could hardly  taste peanut at all. It was good, just not what I was looking for.   Tasted everyone else's dishes and the pot pie, shrimp & grits and apple pie were very good. Seated right away during the Saturday farmer's market. Laid back atmosphere and nice patio.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Run of the mill pub.  Consistent and simple. Great Dane's got a decent selection of drinks and food. Doesn't disappoint. You'll know because the place is almost always packed.  Their bagel/bacon/sausage burger is amazingly tasty and one of a kind. I've also tried their Asian pork belly bun, which was surprisingly good given how Asian food goes in Madison."}
{"text":"Professional installers; fixed any problems; prompt; thoroughly cleaned up"}
{"text":"You'll enjoy your time here but definitely not a \"must see\" for Madison. The menu has something for everyone. The beer is mediocre. I've been coming here for the past 7 years and they haven't improved the beer... common guys, you gotta keep up with the Joneses. Good for large groups or to shoot some pool in a casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"A crushing disappointment.   I'm not gonna complain about the wait time before we sat down. It's a busy place and that's to be expected.   What I am going to complain about is everything else.  An almost hour wait at the table for two burgers? Two burgers, that may I mention, were lukewarm when we finally got our hands on them. Why did we have to wait so long for these burgers? I'd ask my server, but he was constantly busy with other tables. He came to our table precisely 4 times. To order drinks, to drop off the drinks, to intercept someone else dropping off our food and for the check. That's it.   Some manager looking type cleared our plates and asked how everything was. We told her it was just \"ok.' No followup questions, nothing.  I understand it's a busy place. But come on, letting burgers sit under the heat lamp for who knows how long is just not right. Our sustain-a-burgers, which are supposed to highlight local farms, just ended up being dry pucks of meat.  I almost forgot! When the server brought back our check to sign, he told us our bill was less than originally shown because he charged us for another couples bill. So this unassuming couple got stuck with a slightly higher bill than expected. Not cool.  Don't buy the hype for this place, and definitely don't buy the burgers."}
{"text":"The food here is a little inconsistent. Sometimes it's great and sometimes it's thoroughly mediocre. The cheese curds are the most varied. The first time I had them (some years ago) they were absolutely perfect, and sometimes I've gone back to fine them very good, but usually they are just good. The cheese is fine, but the coating is not the perfect consistency - maybe it's a little too thick or not light enough. The beer and cocktails are ok. On this last visit, I had a blackberry cocktail of some kind that was way too hard and limey for my taste. I used to always order their mac and cheese, but it's way too inconsistent. Usually it just tastes like cheese product instead of cheese. Every so often the mac and cheese is delicious, though. On this last visit I had a mozzarella and tomato salad with grilled asparagus and red peppers. It was very good. But it was too big and when I took it home in their decomposable togo box, the wetness of the mozzarella meant that the mozzarella balls stuck to the paper container and came away with lots of paper. I'm glad that they are trying to be environmentally friendly with their take out containers, but it wasn't an ideal experience. The only thing that's consistently good here is the atmosphere - it's pretty noisy, but not overly so. It's always pretty busy which is fun. One last comment is that our table was very sticky, and that's been true for the last couple of times we've been there."}
{"text":"Fun place with a huge menu of options to choose from. HUGE portions, and this is coming from a Chicagoan! Very nice, would definitely be back here again!"}
{"text":"I went to Madison for training and had to get out into the city a little bit and see what Madison is all about.  My original plan was to go to some Irish pub down the street from the hotel until I got in the van with 3 others going to Great Dane.  Couldn't have been happier to be a follower.  The service was decent enough.  It was really busy and we could have been tended too a bit more but the waitress was ridiculously cute so i'll let it slide.  The brats and mash (pictured) are to die for.  The sauerkraut was interestingly sweet, the brats and mash potatoes perfect.  I had to slow my eating so i could drag it out as long as possible.  Being a microbrewery they also had some very passable beer.  I'd suggest the nut brown.  Ambiance was nice, pick your poison, open bar side or dining room.  The cellar bathroom route gives you a nice view of the brew setup and sort of gives the place character.  Great location down by the capitol building.  Get out and walk around and take it in.  Remember to steal a menu.  They are really unique newspaper read all about it brats and mash style.  I ganked one for myself and a beer coaster for the collection."}
{"text":"This a great place to stop for a drink while you are visiting Madison. After walking this beautiful city stop and have a drink here. Very friendly and family atmosphere. Big windows to watch the world go by."}
{"text":"Service is incredibly well mannered, knowledgeable, and attentive! Food is average but good for overall bar food! I did live the lite lager! You get a free beer in your birthday!!"}
{"text":"Good typical American restaurant brewery. Good place for a good time in town, not so much for the good food, but that wasn't bad neither."}
{"text":"Outdoor garden is awesome! Very good food & service was very efficient. Will be back next time we are in Madison."}
{"text":"What a great place to enjoy a meal and a couple of beers.  I went with my girlfriend for an evening after visiting Madison for the first time.   She is from the area and this was one of her old hang out's in her college days.  She had talked about it and my thoughts were that she probably remembered it as being better than it really was.  I have to admit though, the food was great and the beer was yummy.  To start we had a couple beers at the bar (Landmark Lite Lagers).  It was a Saturday night and busy for them.   We waited for around a half hour but were able to find a place to sit in the area of the bar.  The waitress was quick and it was a nice atmosphere as far as being lively but still being able to hold a conversation.     We sat in the downstairs area, which was cozy.   Some other reviews complained about it being dark or dingy but I didn't find that at all.    We ordered a flight of 11 beers so we could try the remaining one's on the menu and made a game out of how much of them we would drink .  We also did our amateur critique on all of them and tried to describe what they tasted like.... it was a lot of fun and a great way to experience all the varieties that Great Dane had to offer.   My personal favorites were: Black Earth Porter, Devils Lake Red, Old Glory American and the Scotch Ale.   But again, they have a wide variety for any pallet.  For dinner I had a Great Dane brat and pretzel burger which was simply AWESOME.  I mean, how can you beat a hamburger with a bratwurst on top of it?    She had the Sesame Seared Tuna salad which is one of her favorites.  I kept meaning to try a bite but never got to it between having my mouth full of burger and her enjoying her salad.  The waitress was very good.  She was attentive and friendly and quick to serve us but not hoovering or a pest.  She was a good mix.  The clientele was a good mix of families, adults and college students.  It wasn't overly party oriented but at the same time was a casual environment for everyone there.  After dinner I realized that in addition to the restaurant side of the bar there was also a pool hall portion.  This was more filled with college students and I suspect could get pretty lively later in the night.  Overall it was a great experience and I would certainly go there again next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Your typical pub grub with a solid selection of local brews. Ate there a few times and service was always fast and friendly. Wait staff was always knowledgeable in beer selection and very patient with us. The one time I had the hot wings they were fantastic. The perfect amount of spiciness, they were meaty and portion was very generous. Had a few other dishes and all were solid in flavor and serving size."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for a meal, so I can't say anything about the dining experience offered here.  However, the billiard area upstairs is always fun and the patio outside is a nice place to enjoy one of their many tasty beers when the weather is cooperative.  It's also great to have a Dane closer to home, so I don't have to go all the way downtown just to have a pint with my mates."}
{"text":"For what seemed like hours or days in the car with stopped into  this lovely place on a suggestion from a friend who goes to college here. I'm totally famished so I quickly order a Devil Lake Red lager and a flight of beers to warm this southerners cold dead body. After that I ordered a cup of West African peanut stew and an assorted pretzel basket with beer cheese sauce and cranberry mustard. Once my appetite was wet I order the German sausage plate w hot apple sauce a great choice in the middle of winter. I polished off my flight and had yet another great beer called Potters IPA. I really enjoyed my meal here and all the beers I had to wash it down, I may have forgotten a few items but that only means I had a great time here in Madison, Wisconsin. After eating I was quite full and warmed up. 5 stars easy!"}
{"text":"Stuffing!  I visit this Great Dane location for two main reasons - my mom lives a block away and their Sunday brunch buffet! The brunch is stocked with just about everything you can imagine eating. There is a full salad and fruit bar (plus smoked salmon), all usual breakfast foods, fried fish of some type, taco bar, omelette station, meat carving station (prime rib and ham), dessert table (cheesecakes, french silk pie, etc.), and numerous lunch and dinner dishes. My favorites are the stuffing (I'm a stuffing addict) and the cheesy hash browns (basically scalloped potatoes in hash brown form).  On the occasions I come here for other meals, I usually get the Tara's Cajun Chicken Sandwich, a cajun seasoned butterflied chicken breast on a kaiser roll with lettuce, tomato, and red onion. It is accompanied by the most delicious chipotle mayo you'll ever taste. I usually substitute fries for the West African Peanut Stew - chicken, peanuts, and rice in a tangy tomato gravy.  Servers are usually attentive and efficient, and drinks are usually strong if not slightly overpriced. If you are planning on watching sporting events, there are plenty of TVs scattered about."}
{"text":"Good food, solid drinks, and cheerful service are hallmarks of all Great Dane locations, and this is no exception.  I have enjoyed many an evening playing pool, having a few cocktails (I'm not a big beer drinker), and sampling the various items on the menu. Drinks are mixed just strong enough that you don't feel like they are overpriced.  Some of my favorites on the menu include the West African peanut stew (get a cup or bowl of this with any meal and you won't be sorry), the Tara's cajun chicken sandwich, and the filibuster burger. The Tara's Cajun is a blackened cajun chicken breast served with a chipotle mayo on a kaiser roll. This is simply one of my favorite sandwiches on the planet.  The West African is a tomato based rice soup with tender chicken and spices. Give me a cup of this and the cajun chicken, and I am a happy man.  One other item that I enjoy is the pretzel appetizer, which is three old style pretzel rolls served with some spicy mustard and horseradish dip. The dip and the mustard will certainly clean out your sinuses!"}
{"text":"When I'm looking for comfort food the Mac and cheese always makes me feel better.. And washes down well with their own light beer yum!! The staff was friendly and the place was clean. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great food, and good beer!!!   The service leaves something to be desired, but the menu is loaded with great options and the beer always hits the spot.  Try their American Pale Ale, it'll get on whatever's ailing you with a quickness!"}
{"text":"My son-in-law chose this restaurant for dinner and I'm glad that he did.  We had a group of 7 and they sat us in approximately 20 min., which considering everything that was going on in Madison at the time, was fast.  The staff was very friendly and made us feel more like guest than customers.  They have a good selection of beers, most of which they brew. I had the Emerald Isle Stout which is one of the smoothest and flavorful stout beers I have had.  If you like dark beers, I would recommend that you try this beer when you are in Madison.  For appetizers we shared their  Old Glory Cheese Curds (1/2 lb) and their Giant Pretzel.  Both were delicious.  I had a bowl of their Brown Ale Onion Soup which was fantastic. They describe it as: A rich chicken and beef broth filled with pretzel croutons and beer-simmered onions, then baked with Swiss cheese until bubbling. Served in a twelve-ounce crock.  It ranks up there with some of the best  onion soups that I have ever had.  For the main course, I had the German Sausage Plate which contained a Bavaria Sausage Kitchen knockwurst and a bratwurst, garlic mashed potatoes, sauerkraut, Pilsner mustard, gherkins and homemade pretzel roll.  Delicious.  Everyone including the kids enjoyed their meals, this is a rarity, as anyone with more than one kid knows.    Because of the good food all around, fast service and friendly staff I have to give them  a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"I went straight to the downtown Great Dane when my flight arrived, since I had been up since 4am and they don't feed you on the airplane anymore.  The airport location of Great Dane might as well have a different name, because the food at the downtown location is WAY better.  I was feeling like some comfort food, and the chicken pot pie hit the spot.  It's an interesting preparation, and one that I am becoming more fond of.  Instead of pie crust all the way around, it's just the top that has puff pastry, and the sides & bottom are a ramekin.  Wisely, I took a small bite of the applesauce because it's served hot, not cold.  Maybe everyone in Wisconsin knows this, but you can't really tell just by looking at it.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great scenery and a great bartender.  The basement was something special, but I preferred it upstairs."}
{"text":"A lot of people in Madison will tell you to come here, but the food isn't that impressive. The beer is what really draws people in. Definitely a lot more fun when you come in a big 6-8 person group and share a ton of appetizers and have some beers."}
{"text":"CHACH.  As in this place is full of them.  I don't know how the Great Dane ended up getting the way it is now, but it's really tiring everytime I go there and encounter the same idiocy.  As usual, I'll start out with what's good.  The Great Dane has a downstairs outside seating area that is enclosed from the nearby streets which is absolutely fantastic in the summertime.  If you do decide to make a visit to the Dane based on the reviews here, please sit down in the grotto.  The environment is very relaxing and I love how it's downtown yet sequestered away from the noise.  Some of the food choices on the menu will further your palate, and you may even find one you consider \"appealing.\"  But that's all the good news you'll hear from me about the Dane.  Onto the bleak.  First off, the clientele and staff couldn't be more annoying.  Generally on a weekend night the bar is packed, usually with a ton of frat or ex-frat looking college kids, dressed up preppy and filling the place with conversation that nobody wants to hear.  The beer is highly overrated; they might make their own but it's all the same thick, bland, overpriced garbage IMO.  The staff is generally inattentive and getting a spot at the shuffleboard or pool tables can sometimes require an arduously long wait.   I'm not someone who's a one-and-done type, so trust me I've been to the Dane enough times to have a researched opinion of the place.  While my review might sound biased or close-minded, I can say there's at least 2-3 other friends of mine that share similar dislikes.  If your an ex-frat boy/girl or you happen to stumble across a dish you can't live without, then by all means go nuts.  Otherwise pass on this severely overrated restaurant.  The Fitchburg and Hilldale locations aren't any better IMO, but they at least have a slightly different clientele."}
{"text":"Their Applewood Bacon Burger is one of the best burgers I've had.   The seven ounces of local grass-fed beef is where it's at. Just the right thickness and perfectly griddled.  The thick-cut smokehouse applewood bacon is not just there to tag along; its meatiness stands out and holds its own in spite of the wow quality of the beef.  The slightly melted sharp cheddar rounds it all out and reaffirms that you in fact are enjoying this burger in America's Dairyland.   The French fries are just the way I like em. Minimally seasoned and balanced as far as actual substance and overall crunch.  I appreciate how I can count on Great Dane for no frills, classic American deliciousness."}
{"text":"New Mexico Chile soup, salad and beer bread - yum! German sausage plate - yes! Chocolate paired with beer ( you can't leave without tasting the tri -pepper pairing), what's not to like? Pub food does not have to be greasy frat food. Thank you, Great Dane, for a fabulous lunch!"}
{"text":"love it at first sight, even though i'm not a pub fan myself.  the atmosphere is warm and home-y, the place was bustling on a sunday noon but not excessively noisy.  loved their menu that's printed like a newspaper; pretty unique (and relatively environmentally friendly...?).  had a french toast for brunch; it was loaded with the creme thingee, syrup, sliced almond, and confectioner's sugar--too sweet for my taste.  but it wasn't bad per se.  friend has the aphrodite's omelette's (which i thought of ordering previously) which might have had some sort of veggies inside, looked good.  the other friend ordered a sampler of 4 beers, for $6!!!!  no wonder he's drinking even if at noon.  in short, while food and service was not particularly memorable there (typical diner/pub stuff), i had a pretty good time regardless.  the staff was very laid-back (in a way), added to the environment, made me feel very... at home. maybe that's why i enjoyed this place even though the food wasn't award-winningly fantastic. and that goes to prove my point that a great restaurant serves more than just food."}
{"text":"While visiting Madison we had dinner at the Great Dane.  Ended up with a little theme.  Fried calamari app...it was very good served with a tomato based dipping sauce which I did not like.   I had the \"Jaime's\" fish tacos (which I had to get for my namesake) and they were light and fresh but the BBQ sauce and hot sauce that came with them were WAY to hot.   I split the tacos with a girlfriend and she got the salmon club on a pretzel roll.  That was great too.   I actually used the tarter sauce it came with on my fish tacos.   We had an enjoyable dinner.  We sat in the ivy covered beer garden.  Very pretty but the birds were a little loud and having a party in the Ivy."}
{"text":"I love Great Dane. They have an awesome, fun yet also chill atmosphere, great beer, great cheese curds, and great cheeseburgers.  I go there for the bar and also for dinner with my friends. They only have their own brewed beer and it is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Thus, the home of good food. Not only is this place praised for its beer, but it also has amazing food. I would recommend the Jamaican jerk hot wings."}
{"text":"Food is usually good but it's nothing to write home about. Customer service could be improved. Common courtesy and politeness go a long way in the service industry... Some of the Fitchburg's Great Dane staff need to be reminded of this."}
{"text":"Got to love this place. Relaxed enviornment and a very eclectic and diverse menus. Great local beers and burgers.   My husband had a burger and said it was good.  I had a Ruben that's was excellent.  I would recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Stopped in the other day during a recent visit to Madison. Thought we would check out Great Dane after quite a bit of praise. Ended up trying five of their house brews, none of which rocked our socks off. Out of the bunch the porter was top dog.Grabbed an order of their fish tacos too. Much like the beer...nothing to write home about. Way too much breading, hardly any fish. Tortillas and accoutrements were well enough, but not even their hellfire salsa could save this fried fiasco. I'd definitely stop in again to check out a little bit more of their menu, as service was hospitable and friendly, and ticket times were above average. Cool vibe and plenty of space inside, just sad that the food and drink didn't meet expectations on our first go around."}
{"text":"A local favorite.  Fantastic selection of beer on tap all brewed on premises.  Try the Scotch Ale, the American Pale Ale, and the Crop Circle Wheat or just get the sampler.  Also, above average bar food,  pretty decent Friday night fish fry, and six high quality pool tables.  Be warned: the Great Dane can sometimes be a victim of its own success.  On a Friday or Saturday night, the place can be packed and very loud.  Check out the rathskaller or the beer garden to avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"Good food and service.  I have sampled much of the menu and everything has been pretty good.  We always end up bringing friends and family here when they are in town.  There's a wide variety of food selections to choose from, so it's easy to please everyone.  It's a good place for big groups.  In the summer, the outdoor patio and bar is really nice.    This is also a great place to watch a game.  There is a big projector screen, and there are lots of TVs upstairs."}
{"text":"I've been to Great Dane several times at its various locations.  The food is always pretty good...it doesn't \"wow\" but it doesn't disappoint.  It's one of the more reasonably priced \"sit down\" restaurants.  It's also a good place to get takeout if you don't feel like cooking.  The burgers are always good, and the quesadilla is really good if ordered without the sweet BBQ sauce.  I recently discovered the basement area of this Great Dane location. It has a really cool atmosphere...kind of has a Prohibition era feel to it.  It's a nice place to sit and have drinks, and the bartender was very friendly and helpful.  I agree with other yelpers that it's not the best beer I've ever had, but it's pretty good, and I'd much rather have a microbrew than a Miller Lite."}
{"text":"Yummy food and friendly, attentive servers. It's neat that they brew their own beer and their menu is set up like a newspaper.  The outdoor patio is also neat, doesn't feel like you're downtown because it's secluded and below street level  Sometimes I eat myself sick here because it's tasty and the servings are huge. I like the beers, and it's a fun place to play darts or pool too. Once in a while they have live music which is always a bonus. This location does not have brunch, but otherwise the menu is identical to other locations."}
{"text":"Sunday buffet is excellent. Kinda pricey but good food. Not a fan of their beers but decent drinks. Also had a small work event here and everything ran smoothly! Family friendly for Sunday/lunch/dinner"}
{"text":"I had to score right down the middle because first, I love their food. Quite a big menu that makes decision making a bit difficult but I have never had a complaint with any selection I made. The turkey burger (whichever way you want it) is my favorite. Their poutine appetizer is pretty much as good as it gets, which makes it something I most always get upon visit.   The loss of stars is for the beer. I'm not particularly fond of any of their brews, but that doesn't mean they aren't something I'll drink while I'm there (no other choice if you want beer). Though the beer isn't terrible I'm just not impressed. Wisconsin has so many better beer choices it is a let down to have such an uninspiring selection to go with such fantastic food."}
{"text":"Im giving this great dane a 1 star. If I could give it no stars I would. One star is to good for this place. If you like awful over priced food and waiters who try to boost their tip by raising your bill by pushing apps and deserts that your not interested in instead of just being good servers then the Great Dane is for you. I have reluctantly eaten at this particular Great Dane atleast 5 times. Not because I've wanted too (not since the first visit anyway) but because the people I'm  with have no idea what good food is and always insist it's so good! My last visit was on a Saturday around 3. The restaurant was almost empty as it usually is and they're was 3 of us. So of course they give us the worst table in the restaurant. Which in any restraunt is as with this one is any table right in front of the servers station or closest table to the bathrooms. In this case it was the server station. There was a whole row of tables open next to the windows that we could have been seated at, granted the view isn't great as it just over looks a parking lot but hey I rather look out at the parking lot then having to watch the servers stand around. Anyway on to the food. I ordered the Texarkana Burger Seven-ounces of choice beef broiled to perfection topped with sharp cheddar, BBQ sauce, Applewood bacon, haystack onions, and chipotle cream cheese. That's what it said on the menu anyway. $10.75 Now for an extra dollar I could upgrade my burger for an all natural grass fed beef so naturally I did. I should add here that the atmosphere here is nothing special either. It's dark kind of dreary. Oh and the table was sticky. My burger arrives I got the fries as my side. Fries were nothing special obviously frozen probably from cisco. The burger was the real star here. I can't stress enough how terrible it was! The bun was dry and tasted old like it had been sitting out for a week. The haystack onions were completely tasteless. The cheese? I didn't even notice the cheese actually. Processed garbage. The bacon? Tasted old n fake. My grass-fed beef tasted nothing like grass-fed beef. Tasted more like the worst lowest ground beef you can buy but worse. Absolutely no seasoning! It was bland and tasteless. Felt like I was eating a tennis shoe. It probably was hands down the worst most expensive burger I've ever had. The rest of my parties food was just as bad. And this is not an isolated incident. It's always thus bad. I've never had a good meal here. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this place. I'm completely baffled by the numerous 4 and 5 star reviews for this place? My only guess is that these reviewers have either never had a good meal in their life or are drunk when they are eating here?"}
{"text":"I'm happy that Great Dane has four stars as I see a lot of people bashing on it. Why? What are you looking for that isn't here?? They have a great, imaginative menu that knows what and where it is - a bar menu, in a bar. They have FIFTEEN handcrafted brews that are all done to perfection... if you can't find a beer out of these FIFTEEN, you just plain don't like beers, so get the heck out of a MICROBREWERY.   Right when we sat down and saw the newspaper for a menu, we were in love. There were several items on the menu that I was absolutely pumped to try... but my boyfriend and I both wanted burgers. We had been driving all day and just wanted to sit down and have some good beer and a burger and relax. Before I get to the beer, lets just talk about these burgers....and how they made me want to move to Madison. My burger (Texarcana Burger) was amazing! It not only had BBQ sauce on it, but a bleu cheese sauce as well...plus bacon..shoestring onion rings...plus cheddar cheese (but that's a given in WI). And on the side? French fries? No. Chips? Nope. FRIED PLANTAINS! yuuuummm! What a great idea, Great Dane! Put these all together on a jalapeno bun and you get one delish and satisfying burger.  My boyfriend was brave enough to get not only a hamburger, but a hamburger topped with a brat burger..and bacon..and cheese (yes, I may have sent a picture of this to my vegan sister, just for laughs...). This was all on a pretzel roll...which I found interesting, actually had the pretzel salt on it, which most don't. This was an interesting and yummy decision on Great Dane's part. It sounds like (and is) a monstrosity, but it was a darn delicious one. My boyfriend opted for the fries and was not disappointed with those either.   On to the beer...as this is a brewing company.... We started with a sampler. The Texas IPA was the best ..flavorful and bitter but somehow smooth.Stone of scone scotch ale was very yummy as was the organic brown and the crop circle wheat (which is saying a lot because I'm not a wheat beer drinker!). The American Pale Ale was bitter but still very drinkable and refreshing. The only beer I was disappointed in was the Red. It seemed watered down and was not my favorite (and I LOVE Red Ales). I would definitely say to skip the Red if you go try this out. There were several more beers I would have loved to sample if we didn't have more driving to do that day!   My last note is that they have shuffleboard. Ah, shuffleboard. I've said this before and I'll say it again, shuffleboard is great and fun and all bars should have it! We stopped to play a round before we left (and snuck in another American Pale Ale). It wasn't free, but it was cheap (only $2)!  This place was huge with a nice sit down area (with wonderful air conditioning for those humid days), a great pool/shuffleboard/more bar-y area, and a really cool looking beer garden as well!   So, to recap, great atmosphere, good service, GREAT beer and food! You can't go wrong at Great Dane...and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great place to get dinner, drinks or watch a game any day of the week. The menu is HUGE and you are bound to find something you like. They have a nice gluten free menu that includes some salads, a thai pasta, nachos and a few other options. The downtown location is really big an has 3 bars and lots of TVs. Even on a crowded weekend night you still feel like you have room to breathe unlike some of the other Madison bars."}
{"text":"Always surprised how good this place is! We went with work, but the service was great, the apps were outstanding. We had the pretzels, which was the best I've ever had. We also had the cheese curds, again, very good.  A bunch of us had the meatloaf, and again, outstanding!!  Good stop for all yelpers!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun and authentic. The good was very good and exactly what I thought a pub should offer. The beer selection was superb if you are a real beer drinker. If your favor beer is PBR or Miller lite you won't notice a difference. Anyways the energy is incredible and for as packed as it was on a Friday night it still only took 15 minutes to be seated. Staff is very friendly and the service is quick."}
{"text":"I like this pub with some reservations. It's a downtown staple with a huge footprint, they have a billiards room, a dining area and a basement. They have a pretty long list of brewed-on-site beers; most of them are mediocre. The food suffers the same fate; extensive menu but nothing is terribly inspired. The best thing the Dane has going for it is the outdoor seating; it's a beautiful courtyard surrounded on all sides by a two-story tall brick wall. It creates a quiet and pastoral setting which is nearly impossible to find anywhere else in downtown Madison."}
{"text":"Occassion: After dinner drinks and snack with friends, touring Madison Food: cheese curds, red lager Thoughts: Accommodations of environment was great - there is a lively section with pool, TV's etc, and a portion that is quieter and appropriate for sitting down and talking. Cheese curds tasted fine, but tasted like the other cheese curds in the area (i.e. tipsy cow, old fashion). Beer was great."}
{"text":"I came here for my very first dinner in Madison. It's definitely a really \"sconnie\" spot, and they serve some local staples, like curds, pretzels, and the like.  We started with the giant pretzel, which was......... a giant pretzel. I debated for a long time between the Wisconsin cheddar mac and the chicken pot pie, but ultimately went with the cheddar mac because it had Wisconsin in the name (and because I'm pretty sure the pot pie had mushrooms, which I am deathly afraid of). The mac and cheese came with another pretzel and tasted like mac and cheese tastes... maybe a little better.   I feel bad for giving three stars, because my experience here wasn't bad, but wasn't memorable either. It was also at a work event, so unfortunately couldn't drink. I think I'll need to give this place another try sometime soon and order something a little more exciting with a side of wisco beer. This is another one where I'd take someone who was visiting for the weekend to have a real Wisconsin experience."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now, and both times were fantastic. The beer is delicious, and the pub fair is top-notch. Both times, we had great wait staff too. In some spots around the establishment, you can see one of any number of sporting events on their tv screens."}
{"text":"Popped in to the GD tonight before heading to a Yelp Elite event. It was about quarter to six and the place was buzzing, but definitely not crazy busy. No wait and a table right away. Nice!   This GD is probably my favorite of all of them. The outdoor seating area is really a hidden gem and definitely where you should always try and sit, weather permitting. For us, it was about 85-90° degrees outside with a hefty helping of Wisconsin humidity so we passed and sat inside. Womp womp. If the weather was cooler, or even just less humid, we would have been outside.   The building is SO COOL and has a very interesting history behind it, too. It's huge, with the bar area and dining areas nicely separated and several different areas to keep it less packed feeling, even when it's full.  Now for the food. They recently switched up the menu and I am a fan! Lots of interesting new dishes and of course all the classic favorites to choose from.   We started with the Brussels sprouts and cauliflower appetizer. This is a newer addition to the menu and it is good! The cauliflower was my fav, but the Brussels were extremely tasty too. It had two sauces, one with some heat and one creamier, they paired perfectly.   For my main, I went with the Fresh Grilled Salmon. It came with roasted new potatoes, green beans, and a carrot curry purée. The salmon had a beer mustard glaze and the whole dish worked together very well. The carrot curry purée - OMG I can't even describe how good this was. It was so creamy and smooth, like velvet. Yum. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the beans were good covered in the purée. The potatoes were fine, but maybe could have used a little seasoning. Really, I have no complaints at all though.   Other fantastic dishes GD offers are the mac and cheese, the tandoori chicken, the MEATLOAF (this stuff is seriously great), the cheese curds, among others.   And obviously the beer selection is wonderful!   Check this place out! All the locations are fantastic, but the downtown spot is truly a must."}
{"text":"I had lunch there this week and got a buffalo burger with pub fries.  The food was good and the service was fine.  There was nothing that struck me as amazing.  I at lunch for during work hours so I didn't want to try a beer, which depending on the taste altered the rating.  I do enjoy a good stout."}
{"text":"I've been to Madison 3 times for work and each time I've gone, I've been recommended to try Great Dane. Unfortunately, my visit didn't live up to the hype. However, I would give them a second try if I am in the area. I ordered their Brat & Bacon Pretzel Burger. Sounds amazing, right? However, I thought the brat was decent and the pretzel bun was too dry for me. The fried cheese curds on the side tasted stale. If you're looking for great fried cheese curds, stop by the Old Fashioned (I Yelped them in my other review). The only satisfying part of my meal was their beer. Their service is great...very attentive. My server stopped by many times to check up on me and kept my glass of water full at all times. As I mention, I would give them a second chance just because many other people have recommended this place."}
{"text":"I went here over Memorial Day weekend and had a lovely time.  I use a scooter and they were VERY able to accommodate so that was great.  We were a party of six with a couple different dietary needs and the server remained unphased.  I had the Mac and Cheese which arrived creamy and warm and delicious.  My partner had the fish and chips which he says were in the upper tier of his experience but not the pinnacle.  All in all a pleasant and easy dining experience"}
{"text":"Because of the high Yelp rating I was really looking forward to GDP&B, but was disappointed.  Large portions, but quality was underwhelming.   Agree with other reviewers about the beer - too sweet - often the case for brew pubs.  Still, I'll give GDP&B another chance."}
{"text":"aaah the great dane.   So many warm memories sitting outside in the humid summer nights, with fireflies flying about, sipping on a pint of...   ...well, here's where my imagination can go anywhere! A nice refreshing crop circle wheat... or a hoppy imperial IPA... or an emerald isle stout... or my favorite, the stone of scone scotch ale! All wonderful choices!  The only regrettable thing is that the late night menu is so limited! I wish I could have this with poutine! instead, I have to settle for gringo nachos... which isn't bad when you're in your happy beer place... but man, the only other share-able thing on the menu, really, is the beer bread. And while I enjoy the honey butter and bread... please more shareable late night menu items!"}
{"text":"Went last Sunday for the brunch again.  Was all pretty good.  Not great, but good.   Don't know if we'll be back again, I guess I have a problem with paying $50 for brunch for two.  It's pretty pricey."}
