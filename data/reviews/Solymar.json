{"text":"Very disappointed in the price hike and changes in portion size and content of the meals. My jalea had hardly any fish and was mostly fried cassava. The price no longer justifies the food and even the taste has changed. I will no longer come here."}
{"text":"I wasn't messing around with appetizers because we needed to save room for this thing - the aroz con mariscos (rice with seafood). A large plate of Peruvian aji amarillo (yellow chili) rice mixed with fresh seafood. When I say large, I'm talking large... like huge. The platter was the size James Van der Beek's head, gigantic... like an Elvis Stojko sized gourd."}
{"text":"Food: For first time Peruvian food, I'm actually pleasantly surprised. The cerviche is excellent! So fresh and tasty, and no I did not get sick after (VERY important)! And the appetizer chips are so addictive!  Service: Attentive but a little \"too\" much, can you please me space to enjoy my food?  Price: Good food quality/price ratio  Ambiance: Honestly, from outside, the place looked so shabby and once inside, it was kind of dark, I thought the building was going to fall apart. NO fancy decor here for sure, just good food."}
{"text":"Avoid.. Parilla de 75 solo trajo 2 tiras d asado y otras cosas nada interesantes como corazon, panza, todo para rellenar. Malisimo  Las tiras de asado realmente chicas y finas, no el corte tradicional.  Avoid.."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends (3 total) to get some Peruvian food. Had heard it was good. It is located near Jean talon metro, about a ten minute walk. The atmosphere is unique among Latin American because it is a lot more upscale looking then a lot of other places I have been. There is a small bar and a nice wine cellar.  The food was very good and the portions are huge. We shared three platters, which were enormous. The ceviche mix to was really good, a bit salty, but there was lots of fish, calamari, octopus, and other seafood as a part of it.  We also got the jalea, which is a typical Peruvian platter, which had fried cassava and calamari and fish complete with lots of onions all over the place.  The last dish was a pot of mussels, calamari and other seafood in a pot of sauce.  Everything was good and more than enough to satisfy us all, definitely one of the better Latin places in Montreal."}
{"text":"Really love their ceviche plate. A bit expensive but it's worth once in a while. If you love sour stuffs and seafood I'd recommend that plate. :) Staffs are usually super friendly and fast. However on one night I came there with friends where there was a group of mexican musician, we didn't expect our food to come out after almost an hour. That was the only disappointment and I think they have that festive on a certain date of the week, so make sure to call before hand if you want to have a good experience!"}
{"text":"C'est bon et l'ambiance superbe, les prix un peu élevés. Mais c'est parfait pour les dimanches soirs !"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. The anticuchos and trout dish. Honestly, I never order fish in restaurants, let alone delivery but I needed a hearty lean protein after a good workout.   The fish was perfect, maybe 8oz with rice and a garlic butter and lemon. It was cooked nicely, somehow kept its crispness with the delivery and still tender. Rice was cooked to perfection and seasoned perfectly. It was exactly what I needed! The anticuchos were very good but overpriced. Working as a peruvian chef, I love anticuchos and know that hearts are cheap. But nonetheless, they were good.  I will definitely have their food again, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Une expérience à vivre! Un endroit chaleureux avec des serveurs typique! Un gros 5/5 sur le manger et 3/5 pour le prix ;)"}
{"text":"Great to be surrounded by Peruvians! Shows authenticity.  Very fresh fish, good ceviche.  The ambiance was very loud on a Saturday night, with salsa playing loud, and big video screens.  Fried grouper was overlooked...  Good, but not great."}
{"text":"Super flavourful food, great wine prices. The ceviche is absolutely amazing. Service can be a liiiitle on the slower side but the food is really tasty so that's forgivable. The portions are quite large. One of us got the mussels and the entire table was able to dig in with lots to spare. A great little spot! Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Solymar, a name that used to bring joy and excitement upon hearing of this truly unique Peruvian establishment. Full of Latino vibe accompanied with good service and above all, the highlight, flawless food that's like no other. Deliciousness oozing out from eye candy presentation to really really, emphasis on \"really\" to incredible taste in every bite. Have that mixed seafood ceviche once here and bam! If you could dare saying something was wrong about it, chances are it's you who had some serious taste issues. Food here was top notch with reasonable prices that kept us coming back over and over.   Sadly, on our last visit yesterday and after an absence of almost 3 years, my small usual group of 4, found out the king of Latino food lost his way. Everything that this place offered, seemed like still being offered and which their full house is a living proof of that. Just as it used to be in the past. Except for the wrong turn they took on the food part.   What set us aback upon checking our regular food item prices was the 35% price hike. Compared to what we used to pay 3 years ago and now, we found it to be exaggerated. Cost of living adjustment on my paycheque goes up by 2-3% per year and here by about 11.5%? Not fair amigo, not fair.   I can't say the hike was all across the menu because we became accustomed and selective in our choices of food here over the years so can't recall the prices of the rest of the items 7-8 years back. Besides this, I wished the issue stopped at pricing. No, it kept on going yet on another and even worse level: THE QUALITY AND TASTE! Now that is something that makes you fume. If you're going to charge extravagant prices, at least give  extravagant food. We all at the table found this crucial element went down. It's fair to notice that prices went up by 35% but quality down by equally the same percentage.   I am saddened to take this restaurant off my list. It used to be THE place for amazing food. Letting my anger control the stars, I was very close giving them 2 only but since I'm still in love with Peruvian food, 3 it is. My next venture would be to find out for myself the best Peruvian restaurant with best price/quality ratio. Who knows, I might get lucky at my first try and become a loyal customer for a long time and the quest stops there. Until then, if anyone reading this and not familiar with Peruvian food, you have to try, it's a must!"}
{"text":"We've visited Solymar twice on separate visits to Montreal. The first time because a friend in Ottawa recommended their jalea and the second time because we enjoyed it so much the first time. Our first experience was a four-star experience, but the second visit would have only gotten them two stars, so I've averaged it out at three.   On our first time the two of us went for dinner. Our server was very accomodating and helpful in choosing portion sizes and dishes. There was a band playing which did make it rather loud but I thought it was fun. On the table are plantain chips and fried or roasted corn, both of which are addictive. We ordered the small Solymar jalea and a small Solymar ceviche and a bottle of Alsatian white to pair with them. We ordered this combination on both visits because they really complement one another well.  Just so you know - the jalea and the ceviche come in HUGE portions. We were able to finish them mostly because they were seafood and not too heavy (even though the jalea is fried), but we would have been fine with 2/3 the food.   On our second visit we went for lunch on a Sunday afternoon because the boyfriend had been itching to go back with a third person to add some of the barbecued meat to our meal, so we brought his mum. All three of us are anglophones, but we can get by in French if we need to. Our server came to the table and greeted us in French, and when we asked if he spoke English he looked embarassed, said he would find someone who did (also in French, which is fine) and disappeared. From that moment on the staff avoided our table like the plague. Although everyone who came to our table from then on did speak a bit of English (we felt as though we were communicating with them just fine), they were obviously uncomfortable dealing with us and so the service was extremely slow and inattentive. (Luckily we ordered a bottle of wine, so we could pour for ourselves.) We really wouldn't have minded accomodating the staff by making our best attempt at French, but once they found out we spoke English they never gave us a chance. It was realy disappointing.   We ordered the jalaea and the ceviche again (still \"small\" plates) and added on beef short ribs from the grill. The jalea and ceviche were as delicious together as we remembered - the lime in the ceviche cuts the fat from the fried seafood just perfectly and the vegetables that come with both are different and delicious.   The beef short ribs had a great smoky flavour, but they were very tough. They came with rice and a salad that we didn't end up eating, but only because we had too much food. It's worth noting that while the jalea and ceviche are great for sharing and the portions of all three meals are huge, the way the rice and salad came with the short ribs made it pretty obvious that it's intended to be a meal for one.   I always decide to bump a restaurant up to four stars based on whether or not I would go back given that there are lots of other great places to eat. Obviously we felt that way after our first visit, but based on our last visit alone I wouldn't go back to Solymar unless I was with someone who spoke fluent French. There are other Peruvian restaurants in the city, we'll try them out next time we're in the mood."}
{"text":"This restaurant is easily amongst the top 5 in Montreal in my opinion. Even though the service can be a bit slow, the food is incredibly delicious, the seafood is fresh, and well seasoned. Even the appetizers taste good! The waiter was really nice and very patient with us. I loved the environment and the musicians! Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Perfect for a cocktail and some snacks; don't head here for dinner, because fish is not so fresh (especially the shrimps) and the ceviche is ok, but not as spicy as it should. Try their Pisco Sour and just enjoy calamaros fritos."}
{"text":"This is the best peruvian food you can eat in Montreal.   My Girlfriend is peruvian and she have tried the best peruvian restaurant in Montreal so she said it's the best you can  taste in Montreal !   I went to this restaurant several times and taste the ceviche and the Roasted chicken  and it's always excellent and the service is also very good.   So if you want a taste from Peru you can surely have a good idea of what it is to feel the sun on your skin and the nice food in your mouth in this excellent restaurant !    If you hesitate between pizzelicoq and this restaurant( they are just beside), just choose the one that are less full as it's the same owner and the food are the same !  C'est tout simplement le meilleur restaurant de nourriture Péruvienne à Montréal !  Ma copine est péruvienne, elle a essayé les meilleurs restaurants péruviens et elle affirme que c'est les meilleur restaurant Péruvien que vous pouvez déguster à Montréal !   Je suis aller plusieurs fois dans ce restaurant et le ceviche (poisson cuit avec la lime) et le poulet cuit sur le charbon de bois sont excellent, le service est aussi très bon !  Si vous voulez avoir une idée de la nourriture Péruvienne typique, vous pouvez utiliser votre imagination et ressentir le soleil sur votre peau ainsi que l'excellente nourriture péruvienne sur vos papilles gustatives dans cet excellent restaurant !       Si jamais vous hésitez entre pizzellicoq  et ce restaurant choisissez le moins plein car c'est le même propriétaire et la même excellente nourriture Lol !"}
{"text":"Last summer we enjoyed a delicious dinner here so we went back this year to find we we're not disappointed.  Alex, our server, was wonderful and the food was not only delicious but savory.   The Jalea Solymar was an abundant portion as well as the Arroz con Mariscos.   We had the Pisco Sours and they were on point!   Overall, a great night out!"}
{"text":"Es el mejor restaurante peruano que he probado en Montreal, el arroz chaufa es mi preferido, el pisco sour es delicioso... Y los platanitos que dan al inicio son muy ricos!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this one with a Peruvian friend who was able to confirm that the food was A-OK and the Pisco Sour cocktails quite good, enough to remind her of her native country. I liked the food and the overall ambience.  The service was spotty, but quick to correct mistakes. However the main drag of this place is the painful noise level, driven by the in-house band singing Happy Birthday songs at just about every table, with wireless mikes and amplified guitars... And they can go on for two hours straight without a pause :)  So, be warned: don't go there if a meaningful conversation needs to take place."}
{"text":"We tried out this restaurant with a grouo of foodie friends and truly enjoyed it! This cozy resto has been around on St-hubert Street for many years and now know why this Peruvian resto is so popular and loved by many. The resto itself is quite cozy and has two floors which can accomodate large groups. Once you enter the resto , the ambiance quickly transports you to South America with great latin music playing in the background. The service is super-friendly and helpful in suggested great dishes for those who have not yet tasted Peruvian food dishes before. Now for the menu..one word...Wow! So many great dishes to choose from, from mussels, to seafood , grilled meats and ceviches. All their plates are huge portions so I recommennd sharing. I ordered their grilled ribs which were brought to the table in this really cute grilling dish which had charcoal underneath....the ribs were trully amazing!  We also tried the grilled pork chops which were perfectly tender and tasty.  The ceviches dishes were so beautifully plated and wonderful.  This resto is perfect for birthday celebrations, family gatherings and friends get together. Will definately go back to try some of their other great dishes!"}
{"text":"Mon ami péruvien m'a fait découvrir les délices de son pays à cet restaurant. Le pisco sour, la boisson traditionnelle est vraiment à essayer! Si vous aimez le Amaretto Sour vous allez adorer.  Le ceviche est un classique à essayer aussi. Les plats sont immenses et savoureux.  Si vous voulez mangez quelque chose de différent et ne pas être déçus... allez à Solymar!"}
{"text":"Ate here in a group of 7 on a busy Saturday night. Ordered the Chicharron Solymar, choros y Maricos, pescado mero frito - Fried Grouper with french fries, ceviche, salmon and the jalea solymar. Great food, big servings, great ambiance!"}
{"text":"Aussi drôle que celà puisse paraître, c'était mon premier essai de mets péruvien. J'en revenais pas moi même. Un soir d'hiver alors que la rue St-Hubert était morte, nous avons difficilement trouver la porte d'entrée. Pourtant une fois à l'intérieur le restaurant est immense et sur deux étages. Grand choix de vins à très bas prix (prix de la SAQ, quoi demander de plus). J'ai commandé le plat de Choros y mariscos, soit des moules, crevettes et palourdes dans une sauce rosée servi dans une chaudière. Portion GÉNÉREUSE. La cuisson des fruits de mer était parfaite. L'ensemble des invités étaient satisfaits. La facture est plus que raisonnable mais le service était lent et laissait à désirer. Tout de même, à essayer sans faute!!!!! Plus de place pour le dessert mais j'y retourne pour les beignets!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service. Plenty of seating for our large party. Great variety of meats and seafood! And the ceviche was delicious. Warning- LARGE PORTIONS  We had every other person oder a dish and we shared. Really enjoyed our time here."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant once before with better results.  Unfortunately I needed a place to eat on Valentines Day.    My colleague and I shared the Valentines Special Fixed Prixe of Filet Mignon and Lobster tail for $63. The restaurant was jam packed with Valentines and therefore extremely busy.  There was a live trio serenading each table which I enjoyed.    There was a language problem with the waiter as I don't speak French and it was quite noisy.  The food was good even tho the Filet was a tiny bit overcooked (wasn't consulted how I wanted it cooked but it was good nonetheless.)  The meal was served on a dish with live coals under it - kinda neat.  Side dishes were rice, grilled veg and a pureed potato spinach side dish.  Very good and so different.  All in all a good meal.  Service was slow which is to be expected.  We ordered 2 decaf coffee and got 1 decaf 1 tea no milk.    The cheesecake was sadly not house made and my first bite tasted hard and freezer burned hence the 3 rating.  A fun place I would go again."}
{"text":"Had pollo a la brasa with my family and it was good! Staff is super friendly, although that one time the server was Mexican, not Peruvian. Never had a problem with them language-wise because we speak Spanish obviously, but they really try to accommodate everyone.  The fact that some people in the reviews are upset because of the English situation seems very ungrateful; these people try their best to speak three languages at work! Meanwhile, we always have to hear you butcher the name of all our dishes... Hmm..."}
{"text":"lots of locals, delicious food, friendly service. Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Les plats sont bons, mais sans plus. Comparé à d'autres resto péruviens, j'ai été quelque peu déçu. Les nets semblent un peu fade."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the most authentic Peruvian restaurant in town. They've been here awhile and have been constant in their food and service. The wine list is good and you pay at the price of the SAQ. They will only charge you a bottle fee of 5,95$ per bottle. Not too bad if you ask me!   Some might be surprised by the prices on the menu. Do not be fooled. The portions are HUGE!!! We always have leftover and end up with a meal the next day ;). The food is very well seasoned and well cooked. The only thing was the food was a on the little salty side for me. My husband thought so too but it wasn't anything that stopped us from enjoying our meal. Their papas huancaina is out of this world delicious and they do master their seafood dishes! I've never been disappointed.  The service can sometimes be on the slow side but again, nothing too bad. You just have to flag them once in awhile to get their attention. Nothing against the customers, just the way it is because they are very nice and attentive ONCE you get their attention!"}
