{"text":"we have been here 3 times and it has progressively gone downhill. the service sucks. if you want to be ignored in an empty bar, this is your place! the bartender was downright surly and rude and was as ungracious as he could be when he served a beer. the first time we came here we really enjoyed the whole experience. the second time things were getting a tad shaky. this last time IS the last time. we had to get up twice to ask (it is 5:10 pm, by the way, on a Thursday with 4 servers standing around) for beer and food. the food was barely acceptable and the burger I took home and ate later on actually made me seriously sick. the tuna salad is listed as 6 ounces, but in reality was only 2 ounces. the bathroom was like a walk-in freezer, and is dingy, like the rest of the place. low lights everywhere except in the \"kitchen\", if you drop something, kiss it goodbye, unless you have a flashlight. employees have a \"chain-gang\" ambience which really makes it a tempting place to be in the historical cleveland heights cavalcade of restaurants. we left 15 per cent because we respect working people but this is one bunch that really did not deserve a penny. our advice glance once and keep on driving!"}
{"text":"A bar with an \"around the corner\", \"family on a Friday night\" feel that has a menu ranging from the familiar to surprisingly upscale offerings. Have never been dissapointed."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and service but burger cold and flavorless.  Fries were hot but not at all crispy.  Jambalaya tasty but we reeked of garlic for a day."}
{"text":"This is the best bar food on the East side of Cleveland, hands down. I suggest the wings, which are the best I have ever had (and I eat a lot of wings). Also try the all world burger.  It didn't get five stars for two reasons. First, the staff is extremely surly. The bar staff can be condescending and rude, which is puzzling for a neighborhood joint. Second, no happy hour or daily specials. As a result your bill can be too high for a pub."}
{"text":"Ok, I admit it's been several years since I've been here for \"bar\" time.  This review is pretty strictly about lunch.  Not the best service I've ever had, but it did seem quite busy for weekday lunch at a semi-divey East-side bar.    I had one of the specials, a grilled cheese with provolone, tomato, portabella and balsamic aioli.  It was quite tasty, but also probably the greasiest grilled cheese I've ever eaten.  Some fries or chips would have been a nice a accompaniment, but none were included I guess.  I did order a side salad, which I had to remind the server about after my sandwich arrived, and it was good as well.  Bottom line:  good bar food, ok service, I'll come back, but I won't rush."}
{"text":"I really like the Colony.  Nothing is spectacular, but everything is good.  It's reliable and our \"go to spot\" for a close dinner, especially if it's later in the evening.  The pub food is always good and the specials menu interesting.  The beer selection is adequate, especially since they have Dogfish Head on tap and a pretty good bottle selection.  The server are friendly and on the ball most of the time (they seemingly went through a rough patch for a little bit but are back on track now)."}
{"text":"What's not to love about a fun bar/restaurant where the people are friendly and the food is far better than average?   I thought that I would be depressed n my first visit after the death of the owner but I wasn't.   He it felt good to contribute to keeping the place going.   It is a neighborhood bar for everyone even if you aren't from the area."}
{"text":"I agree with Scott H...we were hesistant for a while about going in but I am so glad we did!  We live around the corner and it is our new favorite neighborhood spot.  Great food, and a good variety...but I cant seem to switch up my order...I always get the perch sandwich, sooo good, the buns they use are great, and my husband loves the burgers.  The salads always look good from afar as well."}
{"text":"Our family has enjoyed going to the Colony for years. It has arcade games for kids and a comfortable atmosphere for families. Our kids think the burgers are delicious and the bar food is solid. They also have strong dinner entrees and a good beer selection. Some of our favorites are the buffalo chicken wrap, meatloaf, soups, beef brisket sandwich (when available) and the salads. Overall if you want a relaxed dining experience with good American food you can't go wrong. Great patio in the summer as well."}
{"text":"We left an art fest in little Italy with amazing restaurants to drive over to colony to spread our hard earned $ & support. We passed 50 plus restaurants on our way over. The tragic death of the owner this year was the driving force to pay homage to a local favorite. We are quite familiar with the menu I can pretty much recite it. It wasn't about that..we said let's grab some ales & a quick bite to give support to them still standing strong. I've never seen the place so sad on a Saturday evening. About 6 tables & four people at the bar. Horrid 80s hair band music drowned out the Cavs game & we got a feeling from wait & bar staff that we were pulling them away from drinking at the bar to interact with us. About 15 min passed before someone approached us. When they did take our order it was like we were being punked. We just had a tragedy in our lives I should've looked like the guy & girl serving us.  Come on people...carry Jim's warm welcoming spirit forward. Represent him. Give respect to his legacy. My husband's food was over seasoned & fatty but he said the stale bread would've went down easier with a feeling that we were welcome & our business appreciated. Hope they can survive with alcohol sales until the patio reopens because over priced crappy bar food only carries a local watering hole when you have good energy circulating through the staff. People want to spend their hard earned $ at a place they feel good going too.. that's why Ohio city is packed with young families for dinner. Eastsiders too. Good energy & appreciative restaurant owners & staff pull the crowd if you don't have that you better have an awesome menu!"}
{"text":"I wish I had the experience fellow reviewers had but I unfortunately did not. The service was relatively poor given the low volume of customers, appetizer order was lost and came after my mundane burger. My waitress never came by to check on my table nor offer an apology for the delay. Maybe my expecations were high and I understand things happen but the culmination of the experience was below par. Might only be back for a beer in the distant future."}
{"text":"This is a really cool place to eat. We had a large party including two small children; were seated promptly and drink orders taken. All of our food orders were correct and everyone at our table thought their food was wonderful. I had the pork chop with mashed potatoes and spinach, all of which was perfectly prepared and elegantly presented. The pork chop was superb and the mashed potatoes were homemade and buttery. The spinach had hints of garlic and was very tasty. We also had onion rings as an appetizer which were very good and not at all greasy. Park in the back rather than on the street front to avoid traffic and parking issues. Highly recommend and will eat here again the next time I come to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"A great local Cleveland Hts. bar that has been apart of lee rd for over 20 years. They have the best patio of all the bars on lee rd! Great wings but prices are on the expensive side (food and drink) compared to similar bars down the street. Definitely a must stop on the lee rd bar crawl."}
{"text":"I've been to Brennan's twice now and I have to say I've been less than impressed with both the staff and the food. To be fair, the first time I was there, I had a hot dog. Big deal. But the second time we came, I was kind of confused about why our group didn't just go elsewhere.   We met a group of friends out on the patio and they were smoking, so they were in the smoking area. When we arrived, the waitress came to the table asked us if we wanted to order food. When we said yes, she instructed us to move out of the smoking only section, which, I obviously don't care--there's a designated section where you have to be to eat? OK, deal, I can handle that. But she didn't ask nicely or use a polite tone and that really bothered me. Like we were scolded children or something. This happened again when our new server told us we had to move because it looked like it might rain. He was snotty and demanding as well--where are the staff's manners?! As we waited for a table to open up inside, he snatched up our menus and I continued to get hangrier, while we still sat awkwardly and drinkless. We finally made it inside and got to look at menus (everything seems pretty pricey for what it is). I settled on a burger, which ended up being a surprisingly brown medium rare and the bun was like wet toilet paper. This, after starving, not being able to even order a beer to take the edge off, and the rude staff treating us like we were an inconvenience, was hugely disappointing. Needless to say we won't be back, despite being a pleasant half mile bike ride away."}
{"text":"I've been going here since it was a third of the size it is now. My parents joke that I was the first baby ever in that bar, and probably one of the reasons it expanded.  Always good company, good beer, but the service has really slipped recently.  But its still one of the places I consider a home away from home, and gives me the warm back-in-Cleveland fuzzies."}
{"text":"The food overall was wasn't very enjoyable, but the service quality was normal, and they have two arcade games for the kids. However I'm not sure if I would go back."}
{"text":"Live around the corner. Great food! Great drinks. Fair prices. Good friendly service. The best atmosphere! My favorite place in the area."}
{"text":"Basically it has delicious food, local bar feeling, good selection of drinks and amazing staff. So that description enough should make you want to check this place out. I have been going to the colony since I was little and I love it there! Its definitely a must place to visit in Cleveland Heights! In the summer the back patio is one of my favorite places to sit and spend time with friends.  It gives off the atmosphere of a neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"I come to the Colony very often when I'm in Cleveland, usually at least once a week.  They have an ok draft selection and good bottle beer selection.  The regular menu food is really good bar food, but the specials are a little fancier (I love the lobster mac, its the last meal I have listed in my profile haha).  The back patio is really nice and there's two bars back there with TVs if you want to watch a game.  They also have heating tower things that make the patio good even if it's a little chilly outside.  There is a trivia night, I think on Thursdays.  The prizes are pitchers of beer and gift cards (I once went and only bought my first drink and won the rest!)  The vibe is a neighborhood bar feel, I always know a few people when I go, which I really like!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch a few weeks back, and it was fine.  Nothing outstanding.  The food arrived hot, and fresh, but the one thing that detracted...never got a refill on my Iced Tea.  That's a big miss in my world.  Especially when I'm in a WATERING HOLE!"}
{"text":"Just made it to Brennan's Colony last night, and it was quite a treat.  Better lit than the average pub, we were greeted by a somewhat brusque smile, and eventually seated ourselves at the bar.  The bartender gave us menus which included both the usual pub fare, and a number of daily specials on an unlaminated sheet of beige paper.    I ordered a guinness, and we got a plate of fried mozerella.  Good quality, enough bread.  Sauce was standard fare, tomato based, zesty -- but nothing too special.  I got the stacked burger, my friend had salad and a amaller burger.  We consumed them with Gusto.  It makes for a mean burger, and at reasonable prices.  Service, while brusque, was by no means unpleasant.  About 10 beers on tap, but I didn't get a chance to look at the full beer menu.  Definitely warrants a second visit, provided my coronaries can handle the heat!"}
{"text":"You wouldn't think much of \"The Colony\" from the exterior, but inside it's warm, comfortable, and neighborly. The menu covers all the bases: salads, sandwiches, burgers, wraps -- and also more upscale entrees. I've had the burger and the corned beef Reuben -- both were awesome."}
{"text":"I really want to be able to give the Colony more stars, but haven't been impressed with the food, service, or the bar in general. We've visited several times, and the highlight for me is always the beautiful patio and outdoor bar. The food I've had has always been mediocre, and beers are priced a little high. But I'll go back for that patio!"}
{"text":"Brennan's is a typical pub grub kind of place except for one thing....  The BURGERS... The \"all-world\" is out of this world... But any of their burgers was good...  As Scott G. says it has a wide variety of customers... and it is surprisingly kid friendly..."}
{"text":"If you are going for a beer and to sit at a local bar with good prices, this is a good place to go.  They have a large bar with a few flat screens.  There is a good atmosphere with families, groups and sports teams at dinner time although the food is sub-par.  We went for dinner one night and I had chicken nachos and my date had buffalo chicken wrap.  The nachos were plain and the chicken in both was tough and over-cooked.  The whole meal was just unappetizing."}
{"text":"The patio of Brennan's colony is enchanting and exquisite- a summer's eve necessity. What I found to be equally enchanting was the young female bartender by the name of Meghan. She crafted my rusty nail with the same precision and delicacy only encompassed by Michaelangelo when he sculpted David's manhood."}
{"text":"Does not get any better. Real hometown feel. Great patio, great food, great drinks, great staff. JB would be proud."}
{"text":"If my husband was on Yelp, he'd give this place 5 stars. He loves the Colony. I'd give it 3. So, let's be generous and say 4 for the both of us. This is a homey place and has a nice patio for good weather. The food has been inconsistent for me - I've had amazing things (their wings are great), some satisfying things (lobster mac and cheese) and some not great things (some sub-par sandwiches and weak fries). I've never had an issue with the service. We worked with the late owner to rent out their back room for a party and he was a pleasure to work with and everyone enjoyed themselves.  I'm glad that they stayed open after the tragic death of the owner and I see that they're really trying to continue on like he would have wanted."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Brennan's Colony. The food is great and the service is always friendly. It was our go to place for dinner and drinks when we lived in Cleveland Heights. Love their wings, perch sandwich, and portabella sandwich. The place has a warm neighborhood feel."}
{"text":"I have many sides when it comes to food.  I can be that super healthy girl that's almost to the point of obnoxious (I know because I've wanted to smack people like that), but I'd much rather indulge in one of my favorite things ever: good, stick-to-your-ass-and-thighs bar food.   Oh yeah... that's what I'm talking about. Fried yummies, greasy burgers, sandwiches, finger foods--you name it, I want it. I admit, not all bar food is created equally. I do love the traditional with a little hint of fresh ingredients and creativity. And that, my friends, is why I like the Colony.  This old, east-sider bar is on Lee Rd and it attracts lots of regulars from the Heights. I see people there watching sports, hanging out with friends, sitting for a quick family dinner, all of the above. It's a multifunctional bar without the riff-raff of other pubs.   Now, back to the food. Fresh ingredients and a thorough menu full of crisp salads, entrees, bar foods, sandwiches and homey items. They do bar food well for sure--and for a damn good price too!   Might I add that the vibe is pretty nice too? I mean, it's laid back enough to feel really at home there, but you know you're also not going to see a bunch of loud, stumbling drunks either. A great, yet difficult balance to achieve, but Brennan's Colony nails it.   Bonus? Well, I thought you'd never ask! Holy awesome patio. Seriously. Summertime afternoon and nights are perfectly spent on this huge, fully furnished patio with it's own bar (under an awning, of course.) I don't mean a crappy bar either people, this is a really well-made one, to say the least.   Needless to say I quickly became a regular when I lived in Cleveland Heights. And now? Well, I actually miss this place a lot. I know... sad story, right? The 20 minute drive from Ohio City won't keep me away forever though. I'll be making another trip out soon!"}
{"text":"I would give this a lower rating based on my experience, but I haven't tried the food so I don't think that would be completely fair. The bartenders were fairly dismissive and not entirely welcoming. The drinks were priced as if this place was better than it was. It's a small to medium size place, decent atmosphere but I didn't really feel a strong desire to come back."}
{"text":"I first came here a few days ago, and was pleasantly surprised! The construction on the outside can be a bit intimidating, but the patio atmosphere in the back makes up for it entirely! The staff was so kind and made sure we had what we needed. It was definitely a relaxed, enjoyable atmosphere with great food! Go at night, and enjoy the lights and a few drinks with good friends."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in town!   Not only is it a relaxing pub, but it has wonderful food.  My suggestion (though kind of weird I realize) is to get the meatloaf.  It's amazing! They grill it, and it is honestly the best meatloaf I've ever had - sorry mom!  They also have a wonderful patio for the summer months.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"You may not understand my 4-star rating after just one trip to \"The Colony.\" But I swear this neighborhood bar is a truly special place. I think it takes at least a handful of visits to understand why.  The food isn't extraordinary, but it is solid bar food at reasonable prices. Try the All World burger if you like burgers. It's delicious, and if you order it med-rare they'll actually make it med-rare. Don't be tempted by the Mini All World burger. You'll want the thicker patty, even if it means you share with your mom, or eat it over a couple of days. Trust me!  The portobello sandwich is delicious. The marinated and grilled portobello comes topped with blue cheese, spinach, and some delicious aioli. This is my go-to order.   The salads are pretty good and some of the specials are sometimes delicious. Try the meatloaf if they have it. It'll feed you for a couple of meals.  They don't have a kids' menu, but this place is always loaded with families. Especially on Friday nights. It is hands down my kids' favorite place to eat. While not on the menu, you can order a bowl of buttered noodles (whatever pasta they're serving as a special) for a couple bucks, the chicken noodle soup (when they have it) is another fave, and they have the typical things kids order (chix fingers, hot dogs, grilled cheese, BLTs).   The patio is really quite beautiful and appropriate for family dinner or first date drinks. They have those kerosene heaters to keep it open on cooler days, so grab a sweater and sit outside. The atmosphere is great!  The best thing about The Colony is that everyone goes there. If you're from the area, you WILL see people you know. And your neighbors (or their kids) will likely be waiting your table. They sponsor softball teams and give back in countless other ways. It's kind of like your block party in there...just an extension of home."}
{"text":"I cannot believe that I've been frequenting Brennan's and it took me up until yesterday to check out their back patio. It's beautiful and offers full bar service. If it's a warm day/night, do your self a favor and ask for patio seating."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood spot that offers tasty food, good beer, and an awesome patio.  This place offers really great standard bar food, especially their burgers and ribs, as well as tasty non-standard bar food such as salads and pasta dishes.  No, it's not re-writing the rules of the culinary world, but it leaves you with a full belly and a smile on your face.  Their burgers are delicious, in particular the 1/2 lb. Old World burger with caramelized onions.  Most recently I had their Steak Romaine Salad.  Romaine lettuce with 6 oz. of steak on top cooked just the way I like it (medium).  Very juicy, tender, and overall delicious salad for $13.95. Oh yeah, that's another good point.  The prices are very good and it won't hit your wallet.   My all time favorite part of the place is the patio.  It doesn't even feel like you're in the middle of Cleveland Heights.  On a nice night, having a beer and some ribs on the patio while enjoying good conversation with friends is one of my top ten things to do in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Hmmm...where to begin.  Great place for a beer, if you want to pay for an incredibly over priced draft.  Our service was mediocre at best.  Considering no one even checked in on us after our meal was delivered, we didn't even have an opportunity to tell them how terrible our frozen processed burgers were.  Officially taking them off our favorite list."}
{"text":"Ah the Colony - used to be a heights staple.  Now a last resort for heights diners with no better options.  We used to frequent - but as food declined, service followed.  Most recently I called to place a takeout order and they said they were too busy to take any carry out orders.  The attitude of the wait staff is what I would expect of royalty.  I am sure the colony will continue to do well, because there just are not a lot of options and CH diners don't know what good food tastes like."}
{"text":"I was in town for the week for work & decided to head to a random movie theater on one of my nights off.  While driving to the movies (at a place that turned out to be one of those old-school type theaters that serves beer! separately reviewed) I drove through this neighborhood on Lee Rd that looks to have quite a few cute little restaurants & pubs.  I had to stop.  I checked on Yelp & decided to go to Brennan's based on someone's review of their meatloaf (I'm a meatloaf connoisseur).    Once in, I could see that this was a darkish sort of pub, definitely a locals place, I saw a few couples sitting around on dinner dates.  I think I threw off the staff being a single lady eating at the bar by myself, because I got my beer real quick, but had to ask someone for a menu after waiting about 5 minutes.  It took another 5+ minutes before I could get someone to take my order for the meatloaf special.  But, once the order was placed, my food came out quick.    The salad was the typical iceberg lettuce type thing which I'm okay with.  The meatloaf, however, was out of this world.  The meatloaf slice was a little crunchy.  It was as if they toasted the slice after baking the loaf & it was served on some crunchy green beans and mashed potatoes.  Everything was smothered with gravy.  Yum.  My heart thanks me, I'm sure.  On the beer side, they had the regular beers plus some Dogfish, Great Lakes and Rogue (!) on tap.  I had the Great Lakes and the Rogue Dead Guys Ale.  The Rogue was perfect with the meatloaf.  If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd go there frequently."}
{"text":"From reading what other reviewers had said, I didn't quite know what to expect when I went to The Colony.  It was far less divey than I expected.  I'd describe it as a homey bar attached to a restaurant.  While waiting for my large party to arrive, I sat down at the bar and was immediately offered a drink and/or a menu.    Being a picky vegetarian, restaurant/bars don't always have all that many options for me, but I guess that's why everyone says The Colony isn't your average restaurant/bar!  As I perused the menu, I saw lots of options for me - everything from nachos, to salads, to sandwiches, and wraps.  The daily features menu also offered some vegetarian options, including a delicious sounding portabella pasta.    Once more people in my party arrived, we were promptly seated and had our drink orders taken.  Food arrived in spurts, which left some of us hungrier than others.  I felt a little guilty chowing down on my meatless Reuben while others patiently waited for food, but no one really seemed to mind.  I really enjoyed my sandwich and the house salad I had ordered - they both were fresh and flavorful.  You can really tell that someone in the kitchen takes pride in making good quality food.    My boyfriend really enjoyed his meatloaf.  Others have raved about it in their reviews, and if you're into that kind of thing, I'm sure it is amazing.  I've never seen such a large slice of meatloaf, to be honest.  I look forward to going back to The Colony sometime soon to check out more of their food and more importantly - their booze."}
{"text":"Had a couple of beers, some chicken wings, onion rings, and a burger here last night on the patio. The patio ambiance is quite pleasant.  I was impressed with the wings. The buffalo sauce has excellent flavor. The burger had good grille flavor and generous toppings.   My tummy felt satisfied, but alas, my wallet felt a little less happy. It was a little pricey for what we got. Wings are about $1 each. There's nothing on the plate with the burger. It didn't push my food value meter into my happy place. I would not hesitate to head back when I'm craving a burger, but it won't likely become part of my weeknight rotation."}
{"text":"First, I would say that their service is terible.  (As another reviewer mentioned- I'd give it a zero if possible!). I sat down at the bar and the bartender said, \"can I help you?\" in a very puzzled way (what are you doing here kind of attitude).  Long story short- the stupid bartender put my food in a box and bag, threw it down on the bar with a receipt and walked off!  I never asked for it to go.  I also had to wait a long time to order and asked for a refill of water when my glass was empty (she was obviously ignoring the blatantly obvious).  I then spoke with the manager and indicated that she had not even asked if it was to take out.  They surely don't know how to keep you there or returning with this kind of service.  I never encountered anything like it!"}
{"text":"A solid pub with surprisingly good grub. Nice selection of beers on draft. This place takes on several different guises depending on the time of day you visit. At lunch, it's tradesmen having a beer with their meal. Early evening (full dinner service starts at 5:30), the place is a kid-friendly hangout for beleaguered parents (a bit like a traditional Irish pub in that sense -- mixed ages w/something for everyone). A bit later, more couples and groups having dinner, drinks or both.  There is now a very nice patio with its own bar out back.  Last time I dropped in the service at the bar was pretty disinterested, but I'm hoping that was a fluke."}
{"text":"We live about 2 blocks from the Colony, as it's locally called. We've been there multiple times - sometimes because it's one of only a couple of places in the area that serves a decent late-night bite.   Located in a nondescript building on Lee Rd, inside is a somewhat dim, tavern style place that is very low-key and inviting. Everything we've ever had on the menu has been pretty good. Nothing I'd rave about, but for bar food, it is well above average. They have nightly specials and a little bit of flair on the menu in addition to the standard burger/fries/nachos type stuff.   The only dig I have on this place is the service. Now, I was just there 2 nights ago and although we had a party of 12, the service was really attentive and accommodating to our desire to just sit at our (huge) table and drink and talk instead of moving to the bar. However, on pretty much every other occasion (some worse than others) the service has been slow, even annoyed when we asked for our bill after 20 min of waiting for it. Let's hope that our most recent experience is a beginning of a new trend.  A nice local spot to chill and get a good meal with yourself, a friend, or a big group. Try it out if you're in the Heights."}
{"text":"I really, really want to love this place since I live in the Heights, but I just don't.  I've been here three times and each time has just been mediocre at best.  Yesterday the hubs and I decided to stop for a quick snack and beer during the Holiday Hop.  The bar is in desperate need of an update.  I know it's an old, beloved Heights bar, but it's so rundown.  It's got a great space in a prime location on Lee, but it just seems to rest on it's reputation as a \"Cheers\" type of bar. The staff: zero personality and I overheard a few people complaining about customers.  Never a good sign. When I ordered my beer, the bartender couldn't even muster up a smile or act less annoyed that I asked for a sample of a beer I'd never had and thought I may want to order. Food: we only got appetizers.  Typical bar food which was okay.  Mozzarella sticks were pretty good.  Also ordered a large onion ring.  It is HUGE. More than enough for two. Only real complaint is zero seasoning in the batter for the onion rings. Would have even gone for some kind of dipping sauce.   Prices are decent. They do have a back patio that's pretty badass (for those warm summer nights!) Can't see myself going here with any kind of frequency. I'll keep frequenting Lee Road, just not this place. Darn!"}
{"text":"The Colony is a staple in the Lee Road lineup of food/pubs.  Solid food, great staff and drinks to please anyone.  Plus the patio with TVs and two bars is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good food. Full bar that you can order from your table. Their soups were surprisingly good. Things felt a tiny bit cramped at their bar area, but their attached main dining room was more than spacious enough for the large group I travel with. Had a few tacky arcade game at the entrance that I didn't really see the appeal to, but otherwise the place is very nice place to go, especially with groups of friends."}
{"text":"Since moving to Cleveland Heights, the Colony has become one of my favorite weekend dinner places. A friend from college was visiting the area last weekend and I took her to the Colony for Saturday night dinner. When she asked what she should expect, I found the restaurant impossible to describe! I think I said something like, \"Umm, it's a bar with really good bar food that has a friendly vibe. And tvs so it's sort of like a sports bar. But, there's families there and kids running around. And oh, they have kinda fancy specials. I don't know, you'll like it.\" That kind of sums it up for me. I can't describe it, but I like it.  I almost always get a burger or the BLT. Oh, and a side salad with Ranch dressing because for some reason their dressing is amazing. I am always a little disappointed by their draft selection as it's pretty run of the mill, but I usually get over it and enjoy whatever Great Lakes they have on tap. Overall, I always feel at home there and leave full and happy."}
{"text":"We've been here a number of times, it never disappointes, as long as your expectations are not too high.   Great vibe, Great bar, the food is generally \"good\". Yes I have been extremely happy as well as disappointed with my meal...... Last night.....extremely pleased.   In fact everyone at the table was pleased with their meals, even as busy as the place was. The Walleye and Jambalaya as well as the ribs were all good. Again, not the best I've ever had, but good.  Service can go either way...... Last night I was nicely surprised how great our service was considering how busy they were.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Such a great bar, and good food for a reasonable price.  Good outdoor patio too"}
{"text":"When I walked into Brennan's I was really impressed by the number of guests in the bar.  I wasn't expecting this place that looks like your neighborhood tavern to draw that kind of a crowd.  There were families with children as well as professionals making their way to the bar after work.  I sat down at the bar to wait for my friends and ordered a beer.  They had a pretty good selection of beers on tap as well as a well stocked bar.  The bartender immediately asked if I wanted to see a menu, which made me very happy.  He could obviously tell that I was about to start gnawing on the legs of the bar stools.  Thanks to Yelp, I thought I had to check out the meatloaf.  I asked the bartender, and he was very eager to recommend it.  It did not disappoint.  The dinner is served with a salad and break, which are good, but nothing to write home about.  The  meatloaf itself was pretty stellar.  I could see where this might have become my new favorite food ever if I had a few more beers in me.  They sear it before serving, so the outside of the meat has a really nice crust.  Great touch.  Everything was just a bit more expensive than I was hoping (the meatloaf dinner was $15), but it wasn't anything outrageous.    I enjoyed my time at Brennan's Colony.  I probably wouldn't make a special trip out from Lakewood for it, but if someone wanted to go, I wouldn't say no.  If you're in the area I would suggest giving it a shot."}
{"text":"Oh colony. How you been the location of so much awesomeness. I came as a kid with the rents and continue to come for their killer buffalo chicken salad and possibly some post dinner Coors Lights... The staff is super swell. My only recommendation is to educate the staff on the term \"frings\" which I consider to be pretty mainstream. But for those who don't know... it is a combination of fries and onion rings.  Ooh and I love the patio."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go relax and have a good dinner or night with ur friends or a date! Its not loud and it is family-friendly! The bar is small and they have little Tv's..but the food is really good here. ANYTHING from italian wedding soup to reuben to fries to onion rings...to their specials. It is a home body feel ! Definitely would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food (though a bit pricey for bar food), good service. They have an awesome patio. Recommend the grouper sandwich, great burgers, or any of the salads. Best bar on Lee road."}
{"text":"I made this account just to draft this review; in fact I'm sitting at the outdoor bar writing this review -- by the way it's beautiful. Never had worse service in my life. The bartenders are either overworked or inebriated, either way not getting waited on because we were \"too far away\" from the main bar -- whilst the group of four sitting next to us was waited on -- added insult to the injury of getting an incomplete pour, while simultaneously being scoffed at by the two highly unprofessional female bartenders. They seemed more apt to play around and joke with each other, rather than to tend to guests who weren't in their immediate vicinity.   The food has always been good, an the hostesses fantastic, but unless you're inside with experienced bartenders that care you're up a creek without a paddle.   It makes sense why no one is here in the summers. If we'd sat at a table maybe someone would care. Doubtful I'd be back anytime soon, especially with better and more serviceable options beginning to creep on to Lee Road. Maybe it's the end of the line for the Colony, but I hope not."}
{"text":"This is such a great place to get some bar grub and watch a game.  The service is great and during big Cavs games they will play sound too.  In the summer their patio bar with TV's is also really fun.  It's very large and expansive.  The food is bar fare.  It is excellent!"}
