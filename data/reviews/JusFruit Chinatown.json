{"text":"Let me make this review quick.  I'm not sure why it's getting all these positive reviews as it's just a mediocre place.  While I have not tried many items on the menu (the menu is pretty comprehensive, admittedly), I must say it's a just a typical HK style cafe.  I ordered the seasoned chicken wings and while that was super crispy and flavourful, the rest of the meal was pretty disappointing. First, the taro bubble tea is not even real taro but the fake powdered mess.  The seafood laksa noodles did not have the spicy bite you expect from a Malaysian style dish and the soup was bland.  We then ordered bubble waffle for dessert and boy was it bad.  Not airy, crispy, crunchy at all, but soggy, flat and deflated.  I was so excited when i saw that on the menu since it reminds me of the good ol' bubble waffle I've experienced so many times in that food court in Aberdeen Centre in Richmond, BC.  If this bubble waffle is anything to go by, the regular waffle is probably likely bad too.  

All in all, don't set your expectations too high.  Nothing is unique on the menu and for all the items they offer, you are probably best to go elsewhere to get better quality, such as Try Again for the bbt, Banana Leaf for the Malaysian noodles, White elephant for the Thai dishes, etc.  That being said, it is convenient as they have multiple locations and the wings were tasty."}
{"text":"Not great service and frankly the lady who served us was quite rude.The bubble tea is pretty good but I can get better service elsewhere."}
{"text":"Didnt like it at all. I had high hopes for this place but went there in disappointment!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE Service! Service was so slow when there were only 2 people waiting. My order (Green tea bingsu) was brought over to someone else who ordered Mango bingsu. The staff didn't even apologize for their delay and mistakes."}
{"text":"Greatest taro ever! The bubble tea selection is fantastic and offers a lot of flavours I have not tried before like Longan Honey Milk Tea.  The food is also amazing.  Curry fish ball is so spicy and addictive.  Chicken wings are also well done too even with wasabi flavour to choose from.  I had the traditional and the flavour was satisfying too."}
{"text":"Great place for bubble tea , lots of food options and lots of variety .. ambient is awesome and nice cozy .. defiant under staff but still alright .. egg waffle is too soft would prefer to be more crispy"}
{"text":"Haven't tried the food yet, but the bubble tea is amazing, and TONS of variety! 
I'm lactose intolerant, and their powders are made with soy, and although lots of the teas come with cow's milk, they will make you pretty much any bubble tea with no dairy...
Most of the other bubble tea places, I'm stuck with 3 or 4 flavours that I can have without dairy.  Not Quickly -- they have all kinds of variety! 
Not overly sweet, more interesting 'traditional asian flavour' to the bubble teas. 
It's my new downtown bubble tea haunt! 
;-) 
4 stars instead of 5 cause they are kinda slow...and the blenders are super noisy in that small space... 
Otherwise taste and service are awesome ;-)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, lots of varieties and delicious dessert. We didn't have to wait long."}
{"text":"There is always room for bubble tea! Especially those super sugary slush ones... I try not to think of all the sugar and carbs I'm consuming and just enjoy... now, with that said I wandered over to Quickly the other day to get my fix and it was good!

The interior is clean and modern and you are greeted the moment your foot hits the other side of the door. There are many choices of flavours and pearls/jelly too. What brought me into this location was the rumour of popping pearls.... to my excitement it was true! They stocked two different flavours (YAY!)

I ordered the Mango smoothie with the lychee popping pearls. The service was polite and friendly but it sure does take a while to get your drink so just be careful about that if you expect to be in and out \"quickly\".

Also, It would be nice to know if the smoothies were dairy free, many other places have \"slush\" and then \"smoothie\" and indicate which drinks are made with milk, they do not have this option at Quickly."}
{"text":"My go-to place whenever I want something sweet and refreshing!

Yes they do bubble tea. A heck of a lot of variations on bubble tea too. But my favourite part about Quickly is that it sells AWESOME desserts! If you're down with coconut milk, I highly recommend you go and try the Mango Coconut Sago. SO tasty and refreshing! 

They also sell food (popcorn chicken, chicken skewers, etc), but I've never actually tried any of it. To me, Quickly is a casual dessert/bubble tea place. 

It is a busy busy place, but I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group for late night bubble tea. We were served quickly and the drinks were great! Clean space and fairly quiet. Staff were friendly and efficient. Looking forward to trying out the food next time."}
{"text":"The food and Bubble tea is okay but the service is terrible. They should change the name to Slowly in order to meet expectations. I did hear they have some good food items as well as Taro bubble tea but don't  go if you want to be in and out  quickly!"}
{"text":"Still not over with the shake coma i got from there!! Love it..took d ferrero shake it was rich and thick . Economical and good quality"}
{"text":"I'm not into bubble tea but I really enjoyed the food here. I ordered the chicken laksa and the braised pork rib on rice. Both were good portions, freshly prepared and great ingredients. The prices were very reasonable. I'd return and ordered the same dishes. The fried chicken looked like it was popular choice with the other customers."}
{"text":"So I'm used to quickly in Berkeley - where the a bubble tea on a daily special is $1.25 USD. Guess I don't get that here.

But what you do get is a fast made drink that tastes pretty good. The pearls are nice and chewy. I got an oolong milk tea which was nice and strong and just sweet enough. Can't say much else about the other flavors, but the matcha was a bit watery according to the wife.

Note: the parking lot here is pretty tight to drive into and out of."}
{"text":"Don't expect service as \"Quickly\" as the name!

Overall an average place to get bubble tea but what I saw will make me never come back. Although not too big of a deal, I watched one of the ladies making a drink screw up an order and place pearls in a drink that was supposed to have jelly. In order to fix this situation, the lady scooped out the bubble tea that had been blended and then pour the pearls into a strainer so that they could be washed off for use again. Why wouldn't she just throw it out? Also it took a very long time for me to receive my order (which she didn't mess up or use the strained pearls for).

Overall, not the best location for bubble tea especially in this area."}
{"text":"Me and my friend were very excited to try out their menu. My friend ordered braised pork on the rice which she thought flavourless. When I got my chicken bento, I was super disappointed.... it looks so cheap!! I gave it 2 stars is because my friend says the bubble tea is ok and the shop actually looks clean and nice!"}
{"text":"They're in transition apparently changing to JusFruit. Anyhow I use to love this place. Very amicable environment to chat among your friends or family with a variety of drinks. 

Problem: this place use to have servers but when I went into the store again they told me to stand near the entrance (blocking people bc it's not a lrge space) to order first before being seated. THIS makes no sense. I like to be seated down comfortably to look through the menu not standing and being in other people'way. They also sell food here too which I didn't really have the time to look at the menu for so I didn't get any.

Also another annoying thing is the way they designed their menu. They name the type of drinks like mi ly, snow ly, Fru mi ly. I have no idea what these mean and there's no description of what it actually is. The menu is also strange because I know they do have certain drinks but it's not on the menu. 

The quality of the drinks itself is not bad. I might just get a drink to go but I wouldn't sit here and hang out. It would be a hassle to have a large party that gathers in the front to order anyway"}
{"text":"I went to bubble tea heaven today! I will agree with some of the comments saying thew service is slow....yes it is slow but wow the bubble tea sure made up for it.

I got the Fererror chocolate and omg this was the yummiest bubble tea ever. I almost wished I never went because now I'll be going back all the time trying other stuff!"}
{"text":"Quickly, you've got to get here!  I can't believe I haven't yelped about Quickly earlier.  This restaurant has Singapore Seafood Laksa.  The laksa broth is quite good, a little on the thin side but it's got the right flavours going. If you like coconut broth (not too spicy), this is it for you!  I've also tried their Curry Beef on rice and it's soooooo good!  Another dish I've tried is the Japanese seafood hot pot comes with rice.  Very tasty broth.  Their appys are interesting like curry fish ball, satay skewers, fried chicken wings, popcorn chicken (so yummy!).  

Their desserts and drinks add to another dimension to the restaurant.  I've had the iceflake mango dessert, their taufu fah (soya jello - cold, good enough for 2 people and so neat & delicious how they serve it in a metal bowl within a small taufu fah bucket you get at dim sum restaurants), their bubble teas.  All good. 

Quick fix restaurant for all those hunger pangs."}
{"text":"I've never been to Quickly in Calgary (with four locations and counting) but I have been to the one in Edmonton. One bud absolutely loooooooves this place while another is the complete opposite. He's ready to boycott them. That joke that Quickly should be called Slowly? Very, very justifiable.

We came to the Chinatown (OG location) after our late night dinner to grab a couple more bites to eat along with some bubble tea. The place was busy but in no way was it packed. 

Service here, not going to lie, was painful. We ate dinner faster than it took for Quickly to get our order right. Brutal! If you're in a rush/have other plans, don't come here. They only have three Vitamix's to make their drinks. Maybe get more?

- Taiwanese popcorn chicken ($8.99) - bud #1 swears by how awesome their Taiwanese popcorn chicken is. I thought they were good - hot, well seasoned and crispy but the rest of the gang said this wasn't up the the norm. 

- Salt & pepper king oyster mushroom ($8.99) - everyone seemed to enjoy this more than the popcorn chicken. Nice breading and the mushroom's inside were tasty.

- Grass jelly milk tea ($4.95 large) - one bud's bubble tea of choice for the night. I'd already had BBT earlier so I didn't bother getting one here. Plus, I wasn't a big fan of the ones we had in Edmonton so..."}
{"text":"The food is NOT worth the horrible service! Service was so slow when the restaurant was not that busy (like 30 minutes just to get the drinks, nevermind food!) and every food item we were brought was meant for another table...it felt like a game swapping dishes with all the tables near us... 
They're currently transitioning to JusFruit...hopefully the name change will also bring new staff or new protocol for current staff."}
{"text":"Just went here for a take out taro bubble tea smoothie with pearls.  Very very good bubble tea!  Didn't try the snacks though.  

Seemed very busy.  

4 stars."}
{"text":"You can't sit in their precious seats until you order and pay. Let's get that clear.
If you are a first timer like I am, and try to walk in, you'll get yelled at by the lady behind the counter. There's no clear instruction, just yelling. You know, cause if you want to spend your money here you need her to validate you first.

Once you DO get your order in, you'll realize that everything you ordered is subpar quality on top of waiting for 30 minutes. Did they have to wait for taro powder to be shipped there in order for them to make your drink? Who knows. No one knows. No one knows why this place is so slow and so horrible. But it seems to be moderately busy regardless. This place is not for me. But if people want to support horrible businesses and keep these kind of places alive, well then that's what this city will keep getting. Horrible businesses."}
{"text":"I don't think this restaurant is named appropriately. The boyfriend and I have an ongoing joke of how it should really be named \"Slowly\".
 
This is one of the many bubble tea locations in China Town. It is right at the end of the bridge and tucked inside the back corner of the building. The location is bright and welcoming, and my experiences here are all based on take out. I love the choice of size, and their integration with social media in providing discounts. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant. I love the set up even. But my love stops there.
 
Of the 8 times I've gotten take out here there has always been something wrong. Often times, I seem to order items that are not available yet, or have just \"sold out\". My go to drink has always been \"wheat germ milk tea\". Their translation of it into English has the word embryo is it (which made me lol). The drink has come out chunky and over sweetened both times I've gotten it. I've tried their other selections of tea based and milk drinks as well... still can't find one that's good.
 
The wait time for items for takeout is ridiculous. Even when it's not busy, it will take them a minimum of 20 to 30 minutes to make up one drink. During your wait time, you get to sit in front of their counter, and stare at the workers as they attempt to make your drink at turtle speed.
 
I had so much hope for this place when it first opened. I'm not going to be visiting again anytime soon, but when I do I hope it is not a disappointment."}
{"text":"I spent 20 min waiting for one milk tea at quickly!!!! 20 min!!!!! omg!!!!

I like the drinks there, the food is okay too. But seriously, it always takes forever to have my orders! And today I ordered 1/4 sweetness hot milktea and I was a second take order order, the first take out order was just two drinks. I waited for 20 mins (my hubby waited for me at our car, but he thought something happened, y took so long n came in to check) then the cashier handed me a 1/2 sweetness milktea, I told her 1/4, then she asked n said o yeah this is 1/4 but  \"1/2\" was written on the cup. well... whatever, I did not wanna wait another 20 min...."}
{"text":"Bubble tea shops are opening and closing all the time here in Calgary. Quickly is a bubble tea chain from Taiwan and and I must say WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN!!! Quickly has taken over the old K-Cup bubble tea shop that use to be there. Decided to give this place a shot since it just opened and wow the milk tea is pretty amazing. Very comparable to some of the milk teas I've had in Taiwan. Very smooth and not overwhelmingly sweet.

I didn't have a chance to try any of the food here but that will be a must next time around. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and hope it stays around compared to its previous owners!!!"}
{"text":"I got the traditional milk tea bubble tea with tapioca. It was interesting that you can choose white versus black tapioca. And regular versus mini size. I just chose the usual black regular sized tapioca. The bubble tea was great except it was too sweet! I think it would be nice if they incorporated Chatime's menu where you can choose the amount of sugar - usually I prefer minimal sugar. 

We also got the chocolate egg waffle with vanilla ice-cream. It was delicious! There are some cookie bits on top as well. It was great overall but just a bit too sweet as well."}
{"text":"Definitely not serving food \"Quickly, \" and DO NOT ORDER A BENTO!
I wanted to give it 1 star but the bubble tea and fried food was actually pretty good.

Being a former southern Californian who hung out late-night at Quickly a lot, I was super excited when we finally get one in Calgary. Had an afternoon free to have some quiet lunch by myself, so I went.

It was 3pm on Sunday. Sat down, ordered my milk tea & chicken thigh bento.
There were a total of 7 seated guests and 1 lady waiting for to-go.
15 minutes later the waitress came back to ask me what drink I ordered.  (I really should've just walked out then)
Another 5 minutes before I got my drink.

The drink is decent. But here's what really ticked me off: the \"bento.\" I chose to have fries instead of rice.
This plate consisted of:
 - 1 small handful of fries, about 1/3 the size of Costco's serving.
 - 1 fried chicken leg
 - About 1/4 cup of corn kernels, probably was canned or frozen...
 - And 2 slices of the yellow Japanese pickled radish.

2 fried items + 2 ready-to-heat items took 30 minutes to serve. 
The only time I've had something similar was at Tea Time in Panorama, where they served a similar plate with corn and green beans, apparently microwaved.

Please, PLEASE bubble tea places, I love my Taiwanese bento food. Stop disgracing it with canned or frozen vegetables!!!!!"}
{"text":"I only like bubble tea on occasion, but discovering this gem nearby may result in more frequent treats - best bubble tea I've found in Calgary yet.  Haven't tried their other food, but if it's anything like the bubble tea it's probably delicious."}
