{"text":"OMG - these cupcakes!  I had Cupsie Daisy cupcakes for a recent family get together, and the cupcakes were delicious - vegan or not!  Being the only vegan at the party, none of the guests even noticed or missed the butter, milk or eggs. The cake was moist and decadent, and the frosting was sweet and rich - a perfect cupcake with  a beautiful presentation.  Kim was a dream to work with, too - Very accommodating and helpful.  I also ordered monster cookies as a special treat for myself - they are bombbbb.  The only drawback is that you have to order a minimum of 2-dozen of the same cookie (that's a lot of cookies for one person!), but I was happy to learn from Kim that they freeze well.  I will definitely order from Cupsie Daisy again for sweet treat needs in the future."}
{"text":"Cupsie Daisy bakes the perfect vegan cupcakes!  If you are not vegan, you should still try them.  I have ordered large orders for a 40th birthday party, co-worker celebrations and family functions.  My husband has even surprised me a couple of times by ordering for Valentine's Day and Mother's Day!  The presentation is just as nice as the actual taste."}
{"text":"These are the best cupcakes I've ever had, including non-vegan! They're moist and delicious, and you won't even miss the dairy. Can't wait to have them again! :)"}
{"text":"Quite simply, some of the best cupcakes you'll ever eat, vegan or not. Kim has mastered the art of vegan baked goods in the form of her decadent cupcakes. They have nuance and flavor, rather than just being a mouthful of sugar like most vegan attempts I've tried. And the texture is perfectly moist, while having the moments of gooey goodness that most cupcake connoisseurs look for. Kim is completely accommodating, and even met me halfway from my location to conveniently deliver the cupcakes.  We will be ordering more from her in the very near future."}
{"text":"My mom ordered the peanut butter chocolate cupcakes for my birthday and they were the best cupcakes we have ever had (vegan or not vegan). The frosting was exquisite and the cake was moist. I highly recommend Cupsie Daisy to vegans or even non-vegans because it will be the best cupcakes you will ever have. Kim hand delivered the cupcakes to my Grandfather's house, and also gave us a personal note."}
