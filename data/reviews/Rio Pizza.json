{"text":"Awesome pizza! Super yummy!  Best thin crust ever!"}
{"text":"First time customer, they changed their name to Mio Pizza. On a Thursday night I made a delivery order, tried to order their whole wheat crust and was told they were out of it. Ordered the Mio Special - they take all the ingredients beef, mushroom, onions, green peppers, pineapples and grind it up into a mush. Meat is placed on the surface. The mush was tasteless! We are disappointed because we have been looking for a thin crusted whole wheat crust."}
{"text":"My favorite place to order pizza from in Calgary. If you live downtown call them up , Very friendly and will always give you a deal if you walk in. They always remembered me when i did happen to just walk in and order.  The pizza was awesome and always cooked right, crust is crispy and chewy! everything tastes fresh and the sauce is what made me love this pizza, it has huge flavor and tastes zesty , almost sweet. Great sauce . Great people that own and run the place. Very generous with the toppings.  It really isn't anything fancy but the pizza was amazing , and that is what counts in my book and wallet ."}
{"text":"My favourite pizza place in the city. Tangy sauce, good crust and fine toppings.  They know me by name now lol. I call and they know my order and address.  It's good place, fast service and good price."}
{"text":"Rio Pizza on 14th Ave SW Best thin crust in Calgary I used get pizza from Rio when they were on Centre Street NW..  But it changed hands and it was so disappointing.  I just tried the one on 14th last night and in chatting with the owner found out he left Centre Street 10 years ago.  The pizza..Hawaiian with real bacon..not the ham that every other place puts on in place of bacon.  It was hot fresh and cooked perfectly.  WOW..!  Glad to find you again..!  Keep on doing a great job.  Thanks!!!!"}
{"text":"I love their pizza! They deliver on time and their delivery guys are always pleasant."}
{"text":"I love this place, you can get two pizzas for a very low price. The salad and baked lasagna was pretty good too. I like the fact you can choose from thin to thick crusts. One of the best and inexpensive pizza places I've ever had."}
{"text":"My top leave favourite places to eat at. The pizza tasted very much like the cardboard box. I would say tasted better cold than hot. Good service at least!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite pizza shop.  Nothing fancy, just really good and affordable pizza. They're generous with the toppings and the crusts are fantastic (especially the thin).  I'd recommend it to anyone in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Ordered the Rio Special - Large. Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings also. The pizza was better than great, tasty pizza sauce, cooked well enough dough wasn't doughy which is a concern with that many toppings, plenty of cheese not skimpy on any topping. Crust was crisp and tasty not too oily. Decently priced at 21$ for the pizza and $9 for a pound of wings.  A lemon wedge should be served with the Salt and Pepper wings ;)"}
{"text":"Not a bad pizza,decent toppings and sauce. It was a little undercooked however, and there was hardly any sauce even though I asked for extra.when you combine that with a higher than average price is why I give it 3*"}
{"text":"Mmm good old Rio Pizza. If you're like me, and LOVE a good thin crust pizza. Then you MUST try one from this restaurant! The crust is perfectly crispy and has just the right amount of toppings and cheese to go with it. I used to order from Rio Pizza all the time when I lived down in Marlborough, but now that I moved up to the NW they won't deliver to me. :( lol"}
