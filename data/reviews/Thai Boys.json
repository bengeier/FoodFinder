{"text":"Pad Thai is nice, seafood and shrimp. Portions are it bad for the price. I've only walked in and ordered takeout but I don't think I'd actually eat there."}
{"text":"Certainly acceptable good food, perhaps a little expensive for what it is. Ambience is a little plain and dreary, but friendly."}
{"text":"Decided to try Thai Boys as it is in my neighbourhood. Got the vegetarian \"date night\" combo which comes with your choice of curry, veggie pad thai, rice, and 2 spring rolls. We opted for the red curry and upgraded the rice to coconut rice. I loved the curry and the rice was divine. The pad thai was decent but a touch more sour than I prefer. The spring rolls were alright. The combo is definitely a good deal if you're looking to feed two people and we even had leftovers!"}
{"text":"Big portions. Sweet&sour chicken was delicious. Green curry vegetables was also very good. They both come with a bowl of rice."}

{"text":"Really inexpensive take-out.  Ordered a dinner for 2, and we had so much food left over.  The Green curry and pad thai were both pretty good.  The cold rolls were not very good.. it was one roll cut into 6 pieces.. it wasn't rolled properly and it was just full of lettuce. 

We ordered through JustEat and it arrived quickly and still hot. We would order from there again, just would skip those cold rolls and get a different appetizer."}
{"text":"A nice Indian bazaar alternative, and they continue the tradition of quality food on the corner of Craven and Gerrard.  

Good food!  I've had tasty delivery as well as a very enjoyable meal in the restaurant.  Our server was lovely, and the decor is much nicer than the BBQ hut days."}
{"text":"So I had high hopes for this place as we've been seeking a good Thai delivery place in our area. It has potential, as the flavor of the curry was good but there were some issues. We were dissapointed because we ordered lemon chicken soup and there was not any chicken in it, only vegetables. The chicken cost more than the vegetable only, and therefore was a bad value. In addition there were big pieces of iceberg lettuce in the soup which was bizarre. Soggy iceburg lettuce is really gross. The green curry with chicken contained only 3 pieces of chicken, and the curry tasted good, but the rice seemed low-quality and had a strange taste.  One more issue is that the delivery man was difficult to communicate with on the phone and didn't have any change for a $20. We ended up digging around scrounging up change in the house to pay the bill which was inconvenient."}
