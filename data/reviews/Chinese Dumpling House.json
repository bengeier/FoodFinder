{"text":"Price, Food Size, tasting all great in here.
This restaurant is my top favourite list for the past 5 years!!!"}
{"text":"Rating 3.5 stars. A no-frills cheap restaurant for Chinese dumplings. No red vinegar (only regular white vinegar) served here which is weird for a Chinese dumpling restaurant. They don't serve soup dumplings which also surprised me.Their steamed pork and leek dumplings and pan fried pork dumplings were very good. I prefer Northern Dumplings Restaurant just down the street because they serve soup dumplings. Will return if I want only steamed and pan fried dumplings as I like them better here compared to Northern Dumplings Restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The servers don't care, the food is cheap, and cheaply done. I wasted my money here"}
{"text":"Just discovered this sweet hole in the wall in my neighbourhood. 

Delicious dumplings.  The steamed pork and celery were awesome and full of soupy flavour.  Pan friend shrimp and veg were also really tasty - try the hot mustard in the yellow tube - kind of tastes like Japanese karashi, yum :) 

Service was quick and friendly, bill came to just under 30$ for 2 plates of dumplings, egg drop soup and wood ear salad. 

Will be back."}
{"text":"IF YOU HAVE ALLERGIES, READ THIS.

Went to Chinese Dumpling House for lunch yesterday with two friends. We made it especially clear that one of us was vegetarian and very allergic to shrimp, and to please have our vegetable dumpling orders separate from our meat orders.

My vegetarian friend who's allergic to shrimp ordered mixed vegetable dumplings but they brought us shrimp & vegetable dumplings instead! That was a terrible mistake as we didn't realise until she already ate one. We called 911 right away, the ambulance came quickly and my friend is okay. However, the restaurant did not apologize once, didn't take action at all, and charged us the entire $50 worth of food we ordered, even though we had just begun our meal and essentially didn't eat any of it--most of it was left on the table when we left. We are really upset at the way they handled it and will never return."}
{"text":"Its a small place, not great in terms of deco, but the food was pretty good especially for the price. We got steamed and fried dumplings, the chive pancake ring, beef noodle soup, and the deep fried lean pork. I'd have to say the highlight of our meal was the fried dumplings. I really enjoyed the texture of it as it was partly steamed then fried and the wrapping wasnt too thick and doughy.

Good place for a dumpling craving."}
{"text":"You can enjoy seeing them making dumplings. Pan-fried dumpling is amazing. i always order it. Frozen handmade dumpling is also available and reasonable."}
{"text":"The dumplings are delicious. They're fresh, flavourful, juicy, and cheap. 

I'm writing this review after many satisfied visits because their quality/standards are going down. I started my dinner off by killing a baby longhorn beetle crawling along my table. I later had to pick off a cooked maggot from my pea shoots. Though not surprising, it is still very off-putting. 

No matter how much I crave dumplings, there are other places"}
{"text":"Dumpling Haven, a great way to fill your tummy on a chilly day. It's usually ideal to go with a group of at least 4 so that you can try different dishes and share. The food here is good and the portions are large and affordable. The dumplings are served in woodensteamer baskets and cost about $5 for a dozen pieces. 
When you step into the restaurant you get to observe 2 women making the dumplings behind a window. The dumplings are delicious and the wrappers are very soft, some of the freshest and yummiest dumplings I've had. Good place with a wide variety of meat and vegetarian options.
The service was good as they are friendly but are limited in English (the menu also has a English version, just need to ask). Give this place a try - a meal for 2 will cost you about $20 for a large amount of food. But warning, it can get kinda boring eating dumpling after dumpling."}
{"text":"Great place for a great price 
Try sweet and sour fish and the big platter of the steamed dumplings"}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap. The steam dumplings are the best homemade dumplings ever. 
Six dishes of food was only around $30"}
{"text":"Great place to get lunch! Dumplings are fresh and staff are friendly. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for lunch with my friends. Super packed but was lucky to get a table pretty quick. We ordered 3 trays of steamed dumplings with different fillings, potstickers, stir fried pea shooters, and pan fried red bean pancake. Dumplings were nice and juicy, the wrapping skin wasn't too thick. Potstickers were nice and crispy and pretty big. The pea shooter veggies which was cooked with garlic was nice to balance out all the oily dishes. Red bean pancake was perfect to finish off. 

Can't really go wrong with $5 for 15 dumplings! They are quite filling and fun to eat with friends!"}
{"text":"Not very good.  I had the steam dumplings. Not sure what it is. The dumpling skin was good. Filling ok, I think I could be the sauces that they have too salty."}
{"text":"I love the food there, they make an amazing dumpling and pop pan.

HOWEVER!! The most disgusting thing happened today. Today, I saw several rats in running around the floor. I wanted to throw up immediately, but instead just paid and walked out (I'm too nice, I know). I should have shouted on the top of my lungs \"RAT\".

Be aware, don't eat here."}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to restaurants if we need a quick and/or late dinner. This time, we ordered steamed chicken and mushroom dumplings and the lamb & wintermelon hotpot. The dumplings were delicious and best eaten when steaming hot - be careful of the soup inside each dumpling! The hotpot was served with a generous helping of lamb, wintermelon and starch noodles, but this time the hotpot seemed different than usual. It was more bland and the combination of food just seems a bit off... couldn't quite put our fingers on it. 

Nevertheless, this restaurant is great for a quick and cheap eat. We come here because we know exactly what we want to order."}
{"text":"I love this place. We live near Ossington and have long lamented the lack of decent Chinese restaurants in walking distance from our house. This is a new place and we tried it a few weeks ago. The dumplings are great and the prices are totally reasonable. I also love the hot and sour soup and look forward to going back to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Went there as part of a group of six for my birthday dinner. Fantastic food, affordable, good for both vegetarians and carnivores alike...what's not to love? And this location, unlike the original one on Spadina, serves beer! (They will get in wine for you special if you ask ahead nicely. That's what they did for me. Thanks!)

Particular standouts for me were the pork and fennel dumplings (panfried), and of COURSE the semi cooked potato threads. If you don't know what they are, just get them already. You're welcome.

Another plus is that this location delivers. Also, you can buy frozen dumplings to take home. Three bags for ten bucks, with a dozen in each bag. Yes please! I have some sitting in my freezer already

I think I have died and gone to heaven :)"}
{"text":"Nice cosy place to come. Have never been to Toronto before and there are many Asian restaurants on Bloor st to eat. However I don't imagine them tasting much better than this place. Highly recommend the General Tao's chicken!"}
{"text":"when you find a place who's name contains the word \"dumplings\", and has a sign on their window that says \"best northern chinese food\", then you give it a try.

a great place for reliable, affordable dumplings.

approx $7.50 + tax for steamed dumplings.

i chose an order of steamed dumplings (came with 15; i chose 10 with pork and cabbage, and 5 with lamb). as soon as i placed an order, two of the staff went to the front of the restaurant window and started hand-wrapping dumplings.

food was served about 12 minutes after placing my order. great dumpling skin with solid, flavorful ginger-esque meat filling.

on the table, they also include hot sauce, soy sauce, and black vinegar. the black vinegar is the key to complimenting the ginger + meat filling.

a great (quick) bite to eat during my visit to the Bloor St area. no frills, nothing fancy; just good handmade dumplings by nice people."}
{"text":"stumbled onto this place after RUNNING AWAY from the grotto noodle house across the street.  didn't look much but came out very impressed.  the place is small but the food is fresh, large portions (ie/ 1 noodle bowl is good for 2 people and then some, dumplings - an order is a steam tray), tasty and very enjoyable.  best thing of all.....prices are really reasonable.  

wished the place was slightly bigger so that you had more room and didn't feel bad for lingering as you see the line up forming.  would definitely go back over and over again!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Price is reasonable and portions are great. I always order beef and broccoli on rice (daily special) and it was big enough to fill me and my boyfriend. Their dumplings are not too doughy and one plate is enough to fill you too. I always drop by whenever I'm in koreatown ! It is clean inside and service is good enough for my liking. No complaints here."}
{"text":"I came here with my brother who was visiting from out of town. He wanted some dumplings and noodles. Unfortunately the only noodles close to vegetarian were the pork and vegetable noodles. I have to say it was flavorless. We were using salt on our food which I've never had to do with Chinese food. The dumplings were ok. I'm used to soy sauce on the table and this place doesn't have any. They say vinegar tastes better with the dumplings however I didn't like it. To each his own I guess. The Kung Pao Chicken was pretty good, but again, needed salt.
Prices were good though and the waitress started chatting with us and was very friendly."}
{"text":"This is the same restaurant as the one at Steels and Warden (Metro Square).  Amazing food! It has lots of different varieties of dumplings! They use order sheet, so it makes it easier to order for everyone. The service isn't the greatest, but okay for the price. 

If you're not sure what to order, here is my recommendation for newbies:
- pork dumplings (pick one that has veggie in it)
- fried dumplings
- fried potatoes"}
{"text":"Awful avoid. Greasy and super oily and cheap stuffings that's super overlooked"}
{"text":"The beef dumpling is a must try, juicy and tasty. It is made right at their counter, very fresh, but need a little time to wait for it's ready. Other dishes also good with very reasonable price.

But this restaurant is really small with lots of small tables, it even hard to put all the dishes on the table because of the table size. Service is average, not expecting to much any way.

All in all, a good choice for a casual dinning."}
{"text":"The cheap spot for A-OK dumplings! So juicy, so tender, freshly made right on the spot and served in a bambu dish (when eating there). There's lots of variety on the menu, but wouldn't recommend it. The place is so packed and dirty, I don't trust anything cold or raw and was disappointed with my last visit as we didn't take dumplings that time around.
If want to dine cheap and you're up North East of Toronto, grab to-go at this dumpling house. *Must pay cash!"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends 2 weekends ago and I can say that it is a really busy restaurant. To be honest, every restaurant at commerce gate is busy on the weekend... Parking took me probably 25-30 minutes to find. We also had to wait for a seat, which probably took another 10-15 minutes. The restaurant was full so it was understandable. They rushed to give us a table which was appreciated. 

We were put in a corner (technically is like a hole because there's 3 walls around us, well for half the table anyway) to fit 6 people and all I could smell when I first sat down was vinegar. It wasn't something I would want to smell throughout the dinner. Since we were in a corner, it was hard to find a server but since we were a big group and were chatting most of the time, it didn't bother us too much.

They had a large variety of dumplings and dishes on their menu for a fair price. Everything that we order tasted great. The only downside to what we ordered was the Mo Shu pork. It was $8.99 so I expected it to come with the thin pancakes (like all the other restaurants) but it didn't. The dish was also very small so it is definitely not worth the price. We had to add pancakes for an additional cost, which to be honest, we didn't want to pay, but we did anyway.

Overall experience was decent, as it was my first time going there, but it wouldn't be my first choice in Dumpling restaurants."}
{"text":"There was a line up and was very busy when we got here for dinner, but we got seated fairly quickly and food came pretty fast as well.
Dumplings were pretty good and was served really hot. 
Price was really cheap! Great place to have a quick and cheap dinner!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great prices and good , solid food.  My wife and I order a ton of dumplings and take the leftovers home for snacking later.  We usually order:

Hot and sour soup - it's hard to find a good hot and sour and this is a solid entry a a good price
Cumin beef - really like this dish, a little zing but not too much 
Vegetable dish - need some greens
3 orders of steamed dumplings and 1 order of fried - nothing more to add above what had already been written about the dumplings

Yes, an obscene amount of food but, like I said, we always order a lot as we want leftovers for snacking on."}
{"text":"Wow. The dumplings here are awesome. After going for the first time a week ago I've been back twice. Very affordable and very delicious."}
{"text":"Is exactly what is says, a dumpling house, though there were other things on the menu...

We ordered from meat, seafood and limited veggie options; both steamed and fried and shared a huge bowl of hot and sour soup and an onion pancake.

We liked that we could mix and match the types of fillings per order so we didn't have to get 12 or 15 of the same kind.

Everything was delicious and cheap. 
3 adults; 2 orders of dumplings, 1 soup, 1 pancake and the bill was just shy of $30.00 all in.

Ambience wasn't great and there is hardly any room. I would guess it seats about 20 people at any given time but it was clean enough and they were busy making the dumplings right out in the open for us to watch. 

Another patron ordered some noodle dish and it looked great. 

I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Great dumplings, and a decent green onion pancake--though, like another reviewer has mentioned, it's not the chewy kind I prefer."}
{"text":"Read all the great reviews of this place and decided to give it a try. Got take out and ordered 4 dishes (kung pow chk,  dumplings, beef and brocoli,  and chk fried noodles) . We were very disappointed in the quality of the food. The meat did not taste fresh and the other dishes were soggy and not fresh."}
{"text":"Great dumplings made fresh before your eyes. Hot, flavorful and affordable. My favourite is the pork and Chinese cabbage fried dumpling. mmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"This place I would not recommend to anyone. The food a little below average, the worse part they sit some people right next to us ending up we just sharing a table with some strangers. It is totally unacceptable to me, I don't know it is a common practice for restaurants in China to treat customers like this.
Definitely I won't be going back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my favourite dumpling place. I always come here when I get a craving for something good, fast and affordable. I come so often that I just get the same thing. My favourites are the pork and fennel steamed dumplings, crispy sweet and sour pork, and the slice beef with wrap. Actually I've tried a lot of the other steamed dumplings and they're all really good. I haven't found one I don't like. The pan fried dumplings are also delicious. The skin is nice and crispy and the juices flow right out of the dumpling as you bite into it. The service here is not bad. Not like the typical Chinese restaurants where they rush you. Instead I came one night with my friend who I haven't seen in awhile and we were so busy catching up that we were there for about 2.5 hrs and we still didn't get kick out or anything. I was quite surprised and happy they let us stick around and eat slowly. =P"}
{"text":"This location has good food and okay service. However, it doesn't accept credit cards. This information should have been disclosed to us prior to entering the restaurant. I would recommend this place for its food, but please remember they do not accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Best Dumplings I have had since moving from Australia.  Don't be put off by the look of the restaurants look.  These are made to order and they are fresh.  The restaurant may not be busy but do not misinterpret this as poor food"}
{"text":"Place is very busy and packed quickly.

Prices and quantity is better than the nearby Asian Legend."}
{"text":"Service is slow. Took 20mins to get beef brisket noodle served. When arrived, the beef was still cold inside."}
{"text":"Dumplings galore, if you want good dumplings at a reasonable price this is the place to get it. 15 dumplings start at $4.99. My favourite is their pork and cabbage dumplings, be careful when you bite into them, the juices are bound to squirt out! Their green onion pancakes ($1.99) are good. Hot and sour soup, good. My favourite thing to order here is their fried dumplings(pot stickers). A lot of selection too, I think they have over 100 items on their menu. They have a limited selection of rice and noddle dishes, they have a bunch of traditional Chinese meat and seafood dishes that are worth trying. Whenever I come here, 15 dumplings, 6 pot stickers and a green onion pancake are a must, can't go wrong with those items. 

One thing to complain about this place, it's too small! There's always a wait for a table, I don't think they take reservations either, not good for a big group of people. Also you don't come here for the ambiance, it's purely for the food."}
{"text":"We ate here this evening.  Very hard to find parking and when we got to the restaurant it was  busy, we had to wait a few minute to get seats.. The place is small but the food was good, we ordered shrimp fried rice, wonton and shrimp/pork dumplings. I would say I enjoyed the fried rice better than anything else, over all everything was good but I have had  better dumplings. The prices are cheap and the food is just good."}
{"text":"Food is average and cheap. Similar to other dumpling restaurants. However, if you don't speak mandarin, prepare to be ignored. Can't really enjoy the food with such atrocious service."}
{"text":"Love their shanghai noodles! 100% recommend. I have only ordered them for take out and the portions are quite large. 7$ worth spending. 

Service is also very good. All employees are enthusiastic and nice. 

Great location! Close to Christie Pitts (where I took my shanghai noodles to go)."}
{"text":"The food at this place is average, nothing to complain about but nothing to brag about either. However the service is horrid! We asked for an iced water and a soya milk for drinks, the soya milk came almost immediately. As the waitress brought our first dish, my water was still not here. I waited for a few more minutes and asked the waitress if she can bring me the water (by the way it's the same waitress that took our order and serving us the food), she gave a very impatient \"right away\" response. After 7 more minutes still nothing, so I asked her again and she said \"I'll bring it to you when I am free\"... so at the end I had to go to the kitchen counter and asked the people there to help me with a glass of water... I appreciate the fact that the restaurant is busy, but I'm pretty sure a glass of water wouldn't be too much out of her busy way... after all she did bring us the soya milk almost immediately.... 
Bad service, mediocre food.... really no reason for us to return to this place!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in the pmall area and we were hungry for some dumplings and we stumbled upon  CHINESE DUMPLING HOUSE, the restaurant is pretty small and cozy, the service was great. 

The food however was a hit and miss."}
{"text":"Dumplings are very good. Very well priced, $5.99  for 15 really great deal. I'll order more :)"}
{"text":"After reading the many reviews i decided to check this place out today, and i have to say that the service was something to be desired wasn't great but it wasn't the worst that I've experienced. I ordered the fried dumpling 3 kinds, the pork and chive, spinach and black mushroom and the pork and shrimp. I really liked the pork & chive it was very flavourful and it was prepared beautifully with a very moist centre surrounded by a hot bubbling liquid. The dumpling skin was fresh and not to thick, next up was the pork and shrimp the one thing i really liked was that they left the shrimp whole, and last was the spinach and mushroom , now this was a pure disappointment the filling sort of lack flavour for my liking and the dumpling had fallen apart the seal was broken so i found myself eating the filling with my chopstick and just leaving the dumpling skin so it really lack the texture and experience of eating a dumpling. Would i be in a rush to go back not really, but I will go back someday for the pork and chive dumplings and maybe try some other items off the menu."}
{"text":"Went here again today and was very disappointed. I ordered the home style tofu which was extremely salty. I also ordered the onion fry lamb dish which was just as salty and oily. In addition, the dishes came slower than usual."}
{"text":"Like most reviews, I gotta say this place makes some of the best dumplings in the GTA.

They are served in a traditional steam basket.  If you order more than one basket, they're stacked on top of each other so the dumplings stays hot until you're ready for it.  Besides the dumpling, I would recommend their pig belly.  It's fattening but it's really good.  You can skip on their fried onion dough; it's ok but it's really not their specialty.

Go in small group.  This place is like a shoe box and they squeeze their patron in a cafeteria table setting.  It really is a place for you to stuff the dumplings and get the heck out once you're done.

Cheers."}
{"text":"Needed a quick snack and bumped into this place on recommendation from my girlfriend. Decided to give it a try and was not disappointed.

Environment (4/5) - Pretty plain, but clean. Honestly, I don't expect much from these types of restaurants mainly because I'm here for one thing - the food.

Service (4/5) - Straightforward. Got my food. No attitude, but no smiles either. Again, I'm here for the food.

Food (4/5). Got both the steamed and pan fried dumplings, which were equally delicious. Got the pork and fennel for the pan fried, and the 'three choice' option for the steam (Seafood, Spinach and Mushroom, Pork and Cabbage). Ingredients were fresh, flavourful and not too greasy. 

Value (4/5) - About the same as other dumpling spots in town.

Overall, great food and pricing is reasonable. Would I come back? Yes."}
{"text":"I've bought take out and frozen dumpling here a few times.    Their dumpling is ok, not as good as a few places Chinatown.  The highlight is pan fried dumpling.  Fried noodles and vermicelli tends to be toward sweet flavour, which I don't really like but I can take it once in a while.  Wouldn't recommend their noodle soup because I tried their stewed beef brisket noodle soup once and it was so bad.  The broth is bland and I basically taste no flavour in it.  It also has too much noodle but very little meat, what a shame.  Service overall is quick and efficient as it is not a big dinning area.  Price is reasonable.  Next time if I'll just stick with pan fried dumpling."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is so cheap. For $6 you get like 15 dumplings or something ridiculous like that. And the food is good. The skin of the dumplings is very well made, not too thick. The filling is great too.

The appetizer dishes are good too (jelly fish, cold meats, etc.)

Not a huge fan of their noodles, but I come here for the dumplings anyways. 

There are a bunch of dumpling type places in the burbs, but I would count this, and the place at Steeles and Warden as my favourites. Please skip Asian Legend if you`re going to eat dumplings."}
{"text":"Friendly & welcoming staff. 
Amazing General Tao chicken, not too sweet not too spicy. Great dumplings- variety of fillings. Green onion pancake disappointed- heavy, not flaky. 
Fast take out service
Likely roomy enough for strollers - something I will be considering more and more in the coming months!
Atmosphere is simple, but the place is clean with a big front window where you can watch dumpling construction."}
{"text":"This was my first time there, I went there around 2pm yesterday and I ordered Braised Beef Noodle Soup, Pan Fried Pork Dumpling $4.99/6pcs and Steamed Pork and Leek Dumplings $5.99/15pcs.  The waiting time wasn't too long because food came fairly quick. Steamed and Fried Dumplings were juicy and tasty. They were reasonable price, food Size, tasting all great in here. I sure I will come again!!"}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about. Quick service. Good food. Good prices and clean. I come here quiet often. I've had the Kung pao chicken, various types of dumplings and seaweed cucumber salad. Yum"}
{"text":"I've been to this place time and time again, which is a first for me, since I don't typically find Chinese food salty/spicy enough. I've tried several items off the menu, of course the dumplings, as well as fried noodle dishes, fried rice, hot pot, mapo tofu, chicken, beef, etc. I've enjoyed the variety, and I find that the portions are generous. It was strange when the mapo tofu dish was different the second time I ordered it, but I guess they could have changed the recipe or ran out of certain ingredients. The service is quick and good, and they acknowledge me despite being the white person with Asian friends. The prices are good, and if you come for an early dinner on a weeknight, should have no problem getting a good table. Gets busy though!"}
{"text":"Ordered the pork and leek dumplings 5.99, vegetable dumplings (filling was leek and mushroom) 4.99, and a leek fried pancake. 

Prices were very reasonable for the quantity of the food, 15 dumplings per order, all the food was fresh and made on site. 

Only gripes,

They just have to tone down on the salt/msg, as this can give you a head rush.

Their schlack hardwood floor is like ice.. at winter time it's dangerous. I almost wiped out but fortunately have cat reflexes and regained my balance. :)

Bathrooms - I advise not using them."}
{"text":"Hit this up with a friend who has gone with family before. She and I didn't realize that the entire order sheet would be is chinese, but we made do with some handy character matching between the order sheet and the menu given!

We ordered the pork w/cabbage and the beef/w pickled radishes steamed dumplings each serving 15 pieces. two people 30 dumplings, bring it on! we tackled them with gusto, but it was still quite a challenge and we were stuffed by the time we finished lunch. in total, $13 lunch for 2!! 

Great food and a great price what more could you ask for =D."}
{"text":"Summary: slow service, food tasted burnt, floor napkin back on table, however very clean restaurant

Slow service: ordered at 6:15pm, by 7:00pm, we had received 1 dish

Food tasted burnt: I think they hadn't changed their oil in awhile because 2 of our dishes that were deep fried (shrimps and short ribs) had a burnt taste to every bite

Floor napkin: A waiter dropped my dad's napkin onto the floor.  Instead of offering him a new one, he put it right back in front of him.

Clean: For a low-end Chinese restaurant, it's very clean.  The washrooms are a lot more upgraded than the restaurant that was previously in this location."}
{"text":"I'm not used to non Cantonese Chinese food so this was a bit of a different experience for me. The food was good but unfamiliar. Prices are reasonable. Men's bathroom can be dark and scary for kids but I was happy they had soap and paper towels. I have no idea what I was eating but the pics will give you an idea. The dumplings were chicken or pork. Wouldn't come back unless I was in a weird food mood!"}
{"text":"Real eyes, Realize, Real Lies. This place is only for the first two, Real Eyes, Realize how dope this place is. I would sacrifice an unborn child to eat here for the rest of my life. 

You get an insane amount of dumpling for the right price. 10/10 this is like the McDonalds value of menu of Asian food.

Stuff to get:
- Pork and Leek Dumplings
- Shanghai Beef Noodle
- Panfried dumplings

Don't sleep on this restaurant. This is a spot that dabs on em folk. 

Technique:
Dump absurd amounts of the hot sauce and a splash of vinegar into your place. Place a dumpling in this mixture and let it cool down. The liquid will transfer the heat quicker than letting it rest in nothing. Wait 10-15 seconds and consume."}
{"text":"The name says it all.

This place is TINY, so you have to get used to eating in close quarters to other patrons.  No biggie if you're used to classic small Chinese restaurants.

Make sure you order a bunch of dumplings, because it can sometimes take awhile for the stuff to be made and brought to your table, especially during peak afternoon \"Dim Sum\" times.

Try the lamb dumplings.  It's a different item than most people are used to but is really quite tasty (if you don't mind the \"lamb\" taste).

If you have time on a weeknight, this place is a great place to go to have a \"late\" meal (meaning before 10P.M.).  Great and cheap place to hang out with some good friends and have a hot, fresh, tasty (and inexpensive) meal."}
{"text":"Horrible everything. 0/10 if I could vote with no stars. The food was disgusting, the plates/bowls were unhygienic and filthy, and the entire seating process was fumbled up in a very unprofessional manner. The place needs to reevaluate their business model."}
{"text":"Okay dumplings, nothing special.  They also weirdly happen to serve some Korean food on the menu, and maybe it's because I'm picky but there's something about Korean food cooked by Chinese people that doesn't taste quite the same.  Doesn't have that kick to it (whether the dish is spicy or not). Their gamjatang (pork bone soup) was surprisingly decent despite my initial reservations though even the most typical gamjatang at normal Korean restaurants does taste better.  

Was kind of disappointed and surprised that they didn't have my favourite type of dumplings, \"Siulongbao/Xiaolongbao\" (Shanghai soup dumplings), despite it being aptly named a \"Dumpling House\"."}
{"text":"Decor and seating: Typical Chinese \"I don't care about nice\" restaurant. It's relatively clean, small to medium size. By lunch time, most of the tables are taken.

Service: Ok and quick, can't expect too much 

Price: Fresh made dumplings ranges from $6.50 to $7.99. We also ordered a braised beef noodle soup and love that they add more than 2 vegetables and decent amount of meet for $6.99. The pan fried pork dumpling is perfectly crispy for $5.50."}
{"text":"The dumplings and sauteed soy bean sprouts in garlic are amazing at this place. They are almost always busy. Their prices are very good. The restaurant is very cramped and tiny though. I feel sorry for the two ladies who stand at the front of the restaurant making dumplings all day. The owners should get them rubber mats to stand on to lessen the shock on their feet."}
{"text":"????????????????????????? not recommended ????????????????????????? not recommended ????????????????????????? not recommended"}
{"text":"The pork and chives dumplings are great and super affordable at around $5.50 for ~15. The beef and mushroom hotpot was amazing as well, and a good size for either one person or for sharing. The fried dumplings were slightly soggy on one side, but tasted good nonetheless. 

The staff was attentive and nice, and I'd definitely come again!"}
{"text":"A nice hole in the wall that makes great food.  Pretty cheap to eat and the food is super tasty!"}
{"text":"Dumplinglicious!

I've had a hard time finding a dumpling house that was satisfying.
This place at Metro Square is definitely one of the better ones I've been too.

It's everything you'd want in a dumpling house.

* Cheap.  15 dumplings for $4.99-$6.99.  That is how much dumplings should cost!

*Tasty.

*Fresh!  Dumplings that you can see being made!

Is it just me, or it's not a real dumpling house unless it's tiny and a bit grungy.

Also, if you don't speak Chinese, you can still order easily.
They have the menu in English as well.  You just write a number besides what you want.

We ordered two types of dumplings and the onion pancake.
The pork and celery dumplings were good.  The celery added a bit of crunch and texture.  Something a bit different from the usual pork and leek.

I liked the lamb dumplings more which were flavourful, juicy, and tender!  The skin of the dumplings was a bit thick, but perfectly rubbery and not overcooked.

The onion \"pancake\" was tasty.  More doughy than onion-y.  It's also not really in the shape of a pancake.  More like a fried dough spiral with onions.

I'll definitely be back for a cheap dumplings!"}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced everything and most tried dishes were very good! And good portions. We liked this restaurant and definitely have this place on mind when we want some northern Chinese food."}
{"text":"We wanted dumplings and found ourselves here.
Back in the day, I used to eat at this plaza all the time...
If you wanted cheap food to warm you up, there were so many options.

So, we came here because you can get 15 dumplings for $4.99!
I had the pork and bok choi steamed dumplings, and I didn't hate them...
But, I didn't love them either.  The skins could have been thinner and I found that the filling was actually a bit bland.

However, the other hot dish we had wasn't bad at all.
We ordered a hot pot of veggies, eggplant, and oh-so-bad-for-you-but-delicious pork belly.  It really hit the spot on a cold night.  

This place had a good selection of North Chinese dishes and it's super cheap, but it's not a stand-out dumpling house."}
{"text":"It was pretty packed when I went here, on Easter Sunday around 1pm. A few people were sharing tables, myself included, which was okay with me as I was starving. The restuarant is relatively small.

I ordered steamed dumplings (I would recommend), pan fried dumplings (were okay, but I've had better elsewhere), fried green onion pancake (would recommend but I might be bias since its a dish I like almost anywhere)  and braised beef noodle soup (it was okay, I wouldn't order again).

The service was excellent. I believe the man there was the owner as he walked around asking how everyones food was, he even helped a table adjust their dishes after it was already placed down by another worker so that the dishes were more easily reachable for all the guests at that table."}
{"text":"|| Must Try: Pork Dumpling, Pan-fried Dumpling, Leek Dumpling, Lamb Dumpling

|| Rating: (8/10) Food, (8/10) Service, (10/10) Value, (7/10) Ambience, (7/10) Presentation, (9/10) Cleanliness

|| My Experience:  

Nestled on the side of Metro Square, this place is great value for the quality it serves. Even upon entering, you'll see into the somewhat open kitchen with the cooks wrapping up the dumplings as the orders come in. 

For non-Chinese readers, don't be put off by the menu. Ask for the English menu, which they have readily available. My personal favourite dumplings would be the lamb ones and the pork. They come in orders of 15, so beware when ordering.   

Simple, authentic and inexpensive, this place is a great spot to get your dumpling on!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm.... dumplings. This place is quite small and often packed but the homemade dumplings are worth the wait! As you walk in, you can see someone already making dumplings from scratch at the front. It is quite cramped, service is not exceptional, and the order sheet is entirely in Chinese (so bring a friend who can read Chinese!) so those are things to consider if you're used to a more Westernized dining style and service. 

From all the dumplings I've tried they are fantastic. What I'd recommend:
- Fried pork dumplings (wo tip)
- Green onion pancake
- Any of their steamed dumplings (I think lamb was good and also leek & pork)
- Hotpots (I got the one which is translated as Lion's Head hotpot which came with a nice healthy soup base with nappa and pork balls)

All-in-all the prices was very reasonable and the food was filling. I think dumplings range around $4-6, and the hotpot I got was $7.99. Food gave a very homey and warm feeling, great on a cold night.

Come here if you want to try some relatively authentic dumplings!"}
{"text":"Finally a dumpling-specific place in Mississauga! This is the same franchise as the one in uptown, so I'm excited it has finally made its way here. 

PROS:
- Good homemade dumplings to satisfy that fix
- Prices and portions are OK
- Noodle dishes were good

CONS:
- Slowww for food to come, this could be a hit or miss though
- Ordered the green onion pancake... didn't have enough green onion for me, though I did like the right amount of crispiness
- Fried dumplings were a bit on a soggier side (sad face)

Consensus: Don't expect the best dumplings ever (I've definitely tried a few better ones in Scarborough area), but they are good enough to satisfy your cravings if you are not in a rush for time. Will be back to try other options!"}
{"text":"Since it's CNY (Chinese New Year) eve and Chinese eat dumplings on that day. 
8 of us picked this place, order many food and finshed all order, each share $15 cost. Below are my input:
1. service - accommodating, but not cozy
2. only steamed dumplings, not the traditional kind (boiled)
3. dumplings - 
shell is OK, not much fillings - so, if you like only the dough, they are OK.
size - neither as Bernie C. described as huge nor same look as photos in yelp
4. could improve their fried dumpling. 
5. Hot and sour soup and hot and sour soup noodle are OK, not your typical soup thou.
6. Spicy eggplant no meat - good
7. spicy clear noodle - delicious - sesame paste on top not attractive thou."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick dinner after a long day. Noodles were chewy with a great texture and firmness to them. Food was a little on the oily side but its priced right."}
{"text":"If I could put half a star I would. Greasy dumplings , placed all three choices on the same plate, thanks. And server was rude , never brought us water, and expected a $8 tip, by not bringing our change back , I had to ask for our change. It got worse, the cooks in the back all came out and decided to eat behind us , instead of in a corner , and then stared at the tip left . If you want a terrible night go here!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years with friends and family, and this is the down home northern China restaurant that I keep coming back to.

When you walk in, you are greeted by the sight of dumplings being made right at the front counter, and you can see exactly what goes inside them.  They have about 10 different varieties of dumplings.  Recently we got the egg and vegetable (vegetarian) dumplings ($5.99 for a dozen or so),  and pork and leek.  We also got the spring onion cakes ($2.60), hot and sour soup ($5.59 for a large pot), and a Szechuan spicy lamb hot pot ($8.99 or so).

This was a veritable feast, as we gorged on bowl after bowl of goodness.  My friend commented on how in Beijing the dumplings aren't as luxurious as the Canadian versions, with more egg being used in Canada than in China.  You can also see that the staff making the dumplings are likely from northern China as well, so you're getting the straight goods."}
{"text":"This place is a nightmare. The worst service I have ever had in a restaurant. This place is constantly short staffed and the service is super slow.

Came here on a Friday night and there's only one server in the whole restaurant. The one server is running back and forth in between the crowded people waiting to pay at the front. There's a lot of shouting between the employees of the restaurant and that's how they communicate.

The restaurant is extremely tiny and uncomfortable. I can't tell you how long it's been since I ordered and until I finally got my food. I have no idea what's going on with the service here. All you hear is tons of yelling. 

Food 3/5
Service 0/5

Definitely would not be coming back here again for the traumatizing service."}
{"text":"If you're looking for dumplings in the area, this is one of the better ones. I like how they serve their dishes pretty quickly. I also like the fact that the dumplings are freshly made in house. Ambience is super casual and it's a small tiny restaurant. 

Every single time I go there, I pretty much order the same dishes (hot and sour soup, steam chive pork dumplings, pan fried chive pork dumplings, jellyfish with cucumbers) with another friend. It's yummy, filling, and definitely a good value meal overall."}
{"text":"I'm literally here two to three times a month or whenever I have a serious dumpling craving. It's a standard Chinese no frills place with solid food that's decently priced.

Food 4/5
I always order the hot and sour soup, pork and leek dumplings, jellyfish with cucumber, pan fried dumplings and sauteed snow pea tips with garlic. The dumplings always come out steaming hot in trays of 15. The skin is a little thicker than I'd prefer but all is forgiven when the juicy filling and the warm soup enters your mouth. The hot and sour soup is always satisfying and has generous amounts of ingredients. The jellyfish is a cold appetizer that is refreshing and cleanses the palate since they use soy sauce instead of dousing it in sesame oil compared to other places.

Service 2/5
As I said before, this place is no frills so it comes with the standard non-existent service. Majority of the staff speak Mandarin but generally understand English and Cantonese. The menus are English friendly and the restaurant also has photos of food lining the walls."}
{"text":"The place is small and they are trying to jam as many people in as possible, so you can barely move, feels like the seating on a budget airline. Food was average, nothing overwhelming. The servers were nice and friendly, but the owner doesn't seem to like smiling. Don't understand the hype."}
{"text":"Went here for a Father's Day lunch in 2015 and ordered the following: beef noodle soup, scallion pancake, beef pancake, and 15 pork and cabbage dumplings. The beef noodle was quite bland and lacking in taste, but I thoroughly enjoyed the dumplings. At only $7, the dumplings were well worth their value! The pancakes were both greatly delicious as well, though fairly oily. 

Came here a couple time afterwards, and I can honestly say that I love their dumplings. Always so fresh and made in-house! My mom personally loves the scallion pancake, which, I admit (though I hate most things fried) is pretty tame in oil and great on taste.
We also tried their dessert once, the deep fried red bean bun. It was super light, tasting a bit like meringue (the egg white taste is so prominent). Pretty good, though the wait is quite long for this, as it has to be served piping hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Where else can you get some made on spot dumplings, 15 for $6.99?
For $20, you can be so full, leaving like a dumpling yourself.

This place is meant for quick eat. Nothing fancy, small, very little personal space. You come for quality-quantity.  Don't come with a big party of people

Everything on the menu is pretty good. Go crazy"}
{"text":"Good quality dumpling house in the Annex. They also have a decent selection of typical Chinese dishes in addition to dumplings on the menu. Service was quick. A/C is on full blast during the summers, so you may want to wear a sweater in the restaurant."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped into CDH, based on online reviews. 

It's an unassuming place, food is visibly prepared, decor is traditional but no frills, and prices are reasonable. 

Food was very good. I've had better hot & sour soup in other establishments, but this version was okay. 

Dumplings are SUPER hot inside! My poor boyfriend burned his lip and chin from the piping hot liquid inside. I advise nipping off dumpling tip, and then allowing the steam to vent out.

The lamb dumplings were really flavorful. My son really liked the sweet and sour crispy fish and vegetable and tofu dumplings. My boyfriend really enjoyed deep onion and chive pancake.

NOTE: Establishment is CA$H only.

We would definitely return.

Cheers! Hope it helps."}
{"text":"I love the dumpling house. 
They always make great dumplings and I highly recommend the beef and green onion pancake !
The service is fast and friendly.
The price is very reasonable for the quality of the food.
U go dumpling house u go!!"}
{"text":"Service is good, food is good. My party of 4 got a jelly fish cold dish, hot&sour soup to share, 2 orders of dumplings, pan fried dumplings, and 2 orders of potstickers for about $40! Definitely recommend the hot&sour soup as well as dumplings and potstickers but might skip the pan fried dumplings next time. Also demoted one star because the bathrooms are nasty and I saw a bug on the wall when I walked into the restaurant..."}
{"text":"Chinese Dumpling House is located outside Metro square.  I seldom come to this place as I prefer other dumpling places such as Dai Tai Fung.  Menu is all in Chinese which I hate as I have limited words I can read.  Bring your parents or a friend that can read well or you will have the guess what the dish is.  

The dumpling are made fresh as you can see when you enter the place.  Pricing is cheaper than other places as well and portion is big. Place is tiny and cramped. Tables are almost touching and you will have trouble walking out the place without trying to knock into someone's chair/table.  

Service is kind of slow and food usually takes long to come especially the dumplings.  Place is quite dirty and loud as well."}
{"text":"I'm always skeptical when I hear that there is discrimination at chinese restaurants towards other asian customers.  But when you actually witness it first hand, it's a wake up call from Life saying \"Shits getting real \". 

I happen to be eating their mediocre dumplings (FYI--spinach & mushrooms=only spinach & BLAND) for lunch when a couple enters followed by a single patron. Both parties were seated by 2 separate servers however both servers were tag teaming the couple by bringing them menus, hot tea and then taking their order. And while all this was happening the poor single patron who was trying to get some service, was totally being ignored. You're probably wondering what's the problem. The couple who entered first should have their order placed first. 

So what if the single patron is Asian and the couple is interracial (Asian/Caucasian). Do you think there's discrimination? Oh hell yes!  After seeing that I can honestly say my opinion of this establishment is beyond contempt.

And btw the dynamic between the couple appears to be \"show daddy how much you want that green card\". Perhaps the 2 servers were undocumented and wanted some sugar daddy perks too. Just an obs & gross!"}
{"text":"Went here randomly the first time, and have gone back several times since. The home made dumplings are quite good. Thry seem to be made in house. The downside of that is that they, and other food, take awhile to come out to the table aftet being ordered. What this means is that this is not the place to go if you are in a rush. If you dont mind waiting 20+ minutes, the dumplings and other items arw quite good. My issue here has been that the waiters dont all speak English well, or at all. Their main menu has English translations, but  special items on the mini menus on the side of the tables are only in Chinese. This combined with the said English challenged waiters has ended badly twice when wiered dishes were ordered due to miscommunications (fried chicken cartilage, and fried chicken feet) . If you stick to the dumplings, you should not have an issue. Good place overall."}
{"text":"Freshly made to order dumpling, even the wraps were made after we placed our orders. They made everything in the front of the dinning room so you can judge/learn. 
Dumplings are amazingly fresh and flavorful. The pan fried dumplings were only fried on one side. I like the pan fried shrimp and vegetable dumpling the most. It came has nice seasoning and whole shrimp in it. The green onion pancake is more crisp and hard than the doughy version I love. Overall, the food was great and very well priced."}
{"text":"Tried the General Tao chicken, AMAZING, it's easy to tell that they use good quality meat, the sauce is carmelized to perfection and they add jalapeños instead of bell peppers for added kick.
The pan fried dumpling is amazing as well."}
{"text":"Duuuumpliiiiinnnggggssss! I think this will probably make it to my 2nd most favourite dumpling shop that's closer to home than the dt locations.

Dumplings taste great here compared to other locations I've tried since. The wrap is not too thick and the juicyness stays inside the dumpling which is great. The wrap isnt so thin where it rips when you peel it off the tissue paper in the steamer basket. The fried pancake is also delicious, crispy and chewy to the right amount! Always fresh coming out and not stale or lukewarm temperature. The pancake also comes in a different style than most others where it's literally like a circle. These ones here are made in thinner strips and spiral into what makes a full pancake which is neat. Easier to split off into pieces when sharing! Finally the jelly fish here is one of the better ones compared to several other locations. Taste great with the sauce they make it in and it's cool as it should be. Sometimes they will serve it with cucumbers which I definitely enjoy more because it makes it way more refreshing.

Service is ok. Nothing great and sometimes they just don't see you or hear you. I had to signal them a couple times but they missed me so I called to them with an indoor voice. They didn't hear me. Mind you this place is small so I didn't think there would be a need to use an OUTDOOR voice...but me giving a fair number of chances and losing my patience, I had to use an outdoor voice...THEN did they respond...I don't know what to make of it but I'm definitely aware that some asian waiters/waitresses recognize when my friends and I are born here vs. HK/China, they definitely treat us differently. But that's just how I see it, not saying they are here but I do speculate sometimes when others call to them in mando, they respond but when it's in english they dom't catch it right away? Language barrier perhaps? That's giving them an excuse.

Honestly food wise I'd give a 4 star, but to include the service it would drop to a 3. But I will leave my rating as is because overall despite the service I was more happy about the food and it balanced the ok asian service."}
{"text":"Mom wanted to go for some dumplings, so we have decided to give this place a try. In comparison to other size equivalent Chinese restaurants, I would not say that their foods are worth the price, although the price is not very high and much affordable. The restaurant is small but with a lot of customers, did not enjoy the fact that I had to share table with two other families. Although it is definitely not the place for me, I call still tell that it is a popular choice for many others. If you are in the area and are craving for some dumplings, you can give the place a try."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd be ordering dumplings at a restaurant (too used to frozen dumplings as my student-budget meals), but this place has the BEST dumplings, and it's at an incredible value! Apparently they increased the price, but whatever... I'm already an addict.

So here it is. $5.99 for 15 dumplings (some variants may cost you a little more). Dumplings are all handmade and steamed to order. My favourites are Pork & Fennel (it's actually dill), Pork & Leek and the Lamb ($7.99).

All the dumplings are SO juicy and flavourful. I find myself craving these multiple times in a week. And at this value... Why not?!

Yes, all I order here are dumplings (why waste precious stomach space for anything else?), but if you want to try something else, their Deep Fried Green Onion Fritter/Pancake (might be called something else on the menu) is super yum too."}
{"text":"Didn't try their dumplings, but judging from the only dish that I had - a very simple stir fry yet it was so disappointing. 

Chicken pieces were heavily covered by starch, which is understandable and can be commonly seen in Chinese cuisine (to give a tender taste) but boy it was way too much starch, could barely tell if that was real chicken lol. Just wondering if that's how this restaurant typically deals with (nearly) spoiled meat. 

I still left a tip, considering to be nice and didn't want to say a single thing."}
{"text":"We arrived around 9:40 PM and there were 3 tables seated. We were seated and provided with the menus and tea. We chose three kinds of dumplings, but the waiter told us that they were out of the beef and radish dumplings, so we ended up ordering the pork and cabbage, pork and chives, and pork and fennel dumplings. I wanted the beef and radish but I guess it shows that that one is a favourite for others as well!

The dumplings all came at the same time after about 15 minutes. There were 15 dumplings per steamer. They were freshly steamed and the skin was perfect. It was chewy, yet thin and soft. The filling inside was very hot. They use fatty pork like most Chinese restaurants. The fennel is the Chinese fennel, and they use the leaf portion to give a more aromatic taste. I liked it but it would not be my first pick. The cabbage was soft, and the chives had its distinct chive flavour. Be sure to eat the dumplings quickly because they get cold really fast and the skin gets harder (still good but not as good as when they are hot).

There were 4 other tables that came in after our dumplings came, so this place is definitely good for late night eats. This is my favourite Northern Chinese restaurant in Mississauga, however, the service could improve. We finished our tea but no one came to refill it. 

Overall, this is the restaurant to go to for Northern Chinese food. The dumplings are a must get!"}
{"text":"First thought when arriving: Darn it, there's a line up...Sunday dinner rush. To stay or not to stay...

Second thought when I stepped inside: Whoa, 100% Chinese crowd (including the lineup) and the main language was a mash up of mandarin/cantonese. They can't all be wrong about the food.... And they weren't.

The dumplings seemed to be the most obvious choice for any first timer and it's exactly what I chose. Apparently, the lamb or seafood ones are the most popular. There was a dedicated dumpling station with 2 full time dumpling chefs, so you can see the magic in the making.

Food: (take out)

- Hot and sour soup: not bad, not great. I'd say that it's around the middle of the pack. Could use some more \"hot\" and more \"sour\", but had a good amount of ingredients inside.

- Pork and Leek dumplings: Obviously freshly steamed but surprisingly, they travelled well too. When I opened the box 25mins later, I didn't see one giant dumpling. I think they were delicious because when I looked down, there were no more left!
The skin had a nice consistency, chewy but not gummy. The insides were well seasoned...so very tasty. My only comment is that it was served with simple soy sauce and (I think) plain siracha chili sauce (you know...the green bottle top kind)...it was a good flavor profile but perhaps they could have stepped up with an original sauce.

All said and done, it was a cheap and cheerful, simple meal :)

Cash/debit only, so don't forget or you'll be sorry!"}
{"text":"3.5
My boyfriend is from northern China and he likes this restaurant. The price is really really good. 
I love the pork and leek dumplings. They also have Chinese beef tacos.  It's like pecking duck but with beef and homemade dough. 
You can see the workers making dumplings through the glass window. Sometimes my friends look at them, as if they are animals in a zoo. But only cause they are fascinated with how quickly they make the dumplings. 

Cash or debit only. No credit card so go prepared."}
{"text":"Traditional Chinese dumpling making at the window. This restaurant has home cook style Chinese lunch or dinner. Nothing fancy but nice meal @very reasonable price. I come here at least once per week. The has simple menu and fast service. Cost less that $10 includes tax and 15% gratuity."}
{"text":"I was incredibly excited to have discovered this place on Yelp because my grandma from Beijing has always cooked some delicious northern chinese food for me. So since I haven't gotten any of those classic flavours in soooo long, I was incredibly excited to try this restaurant. Luckily this place did not disappoint, and I definitely will be returning. In terms of the positives, I would pretty much agree with everyone about their dumpling quality, and the vegetarian one (with the egg) is truly the bomb. The dumpling skin is so thin(without breaking) that you can easily see the good stuff on the inside, and all my dumplings arrived at the perfect temperature (not cold but not scathing hot)!! In addition, my grandmother was also acclaimed for her hot and sour soup, and according to my parents, the restaurant did a wonderful job with the soup, on par with grandma! (The fact that the big ass bowl of soup is only 4.99 doesn't hurt either.)

Aside from the dumplings, I was also excited for the potstickers, another grandma classic. Now I must say that having not had potstickers in foreverrrr I was incredibly excited to order this. However I was left slightly disappointed because the outer skin was not pan fried to the perfect point of crispiness. However I won't fault them too much for this, since other tables' potstickers seem to look fine, so my table might've just been unlucky.

As for the green onion pancake, it was actually kind of disappointing and I am surprised by all the hype about it. From what I noticed in my plate (and everyone's around me) there was a lack of green onion, which kind of defeats the purpose of a green onion pancake in my opinion. Going with the negatives, we also ordered a plate of fried noodles, which had a great noodle texture but was VERY greasy, and for some reason the veggies in it were kind of bitter. But I didn't really hold the noodles against them since I realize it's not their specialty.

Finally I was excited to try their dessert with the sweet potato dipped in honey, then put into cold water so the honey will form a candy coating around the sweet potato. I don't think I will be ordering this again, since they neglected to provide us with ice water, which meant the honey wasn't cold enough to become a coating and instead washed off in the water. The dessert was a great disappointment, and being the most expensive item (6.99) we ordered, it was a bad note to end the meal with.

Overall, I believe that this was a great experience if you know what to order. I feel like the items that you can find in any Northern Chinese home is done very well in this restaurant, where as the other items (more restauranty as opposed to homey) are a bit lack luster in my opinion. I'm glad I've discovered this place, and can satisfy my northern chinese cravings happily now!"}
{"text":"Steamed vegetable dumplings, shrimp and veg pan fried dumplings, Singapore style noodle, bomb bud"}
{"text":"No real reason not to give this place 5 stars I just kind of feel like five star should be reserved for the top restaurants in town. This place on the other hand is an unpretentious sparsely decorated northern Chinese spot with great food, very reasonable prices and friendly staff.  It's become my go to Chinese restaurant but I'm eating on a budget which is most of the time. I hope they're here a long long time. Favorites include the pork and fennel dumplings (fried), although my boy prefers the pork and chive, we also like the green beans for soups I love the General Tso's chicken which has a nuclear colour red sauce.   Order it with the green beans for Christmas. Thank you dumpling house!"}
{"text":"This review is for the steamed vegetable and mushroom dumplings.  They were so good and fresh ... skin wasn't too thick, a good amount of filling (napa cabbage, tofu, mushroom) and best of all, they easily came off the steamer basket and did not fall apart while eating. Each table had soy sauce, black vinegar and chili paste.  I like to combine all three for dipping dumplings. I will definitely try the egg and leek dumplings next time.  I only wish they had pan-fried vegetarian ones.  Mr Leny had the pan-fried pork dumplings and hot and sour soup.  The regular size soup is large enough for 2-4 people depending on appetites.

Food arrived fairly quickly and service was friendly and efficient.  The restaurant is clean and bright but a bit cramped as they seemed to make good use of every bit of space.  We were lucky to snag the last free table for 2, though people in line never seemed to wait too long.  You can watch the ladies make the dumplings through a glass window as you walk in.  

Lunch for 2 was about $20 with tax and tip ... one of the best deals in town."}
{"text":"Same menu as the Metro Square location.  The mushroom/veg and egg/leek dumplings were just as divine .. the perfect thickness of skin, good amount of filling and most importantly, they did not fall apart.  We also tried the green onion pancake for the first time.  It was very good ... crispy crust, and soft and onion-y goodness on the inside ... not greasy at all.  We had to doggy bag it since we also ordered both pan-fried and steamed pork/leek dumplings.

I did find it interesting that there was white vinegar alongside the black vinegar at each table.  I have not seen that before and did not think it was traditional.  I am used to black and red vinegar for dipping.  

Service was efficient and most staff seemed to understand English.  Like all Asian malls/plazas, parking can be a nightmare but we were lucky to get a spot just as someone was leaving.  The restaurant itself seemed to be the slightly larger than their other location.  Seating included 3 booths by the window as well as a small private room in the back.  Washrooms were surprisingly clean.  

So glad to have found this location as it is much closer to home.  Looking forward to trying other veg options on their menu."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. A really good cheap eats!

Recently changed owners and newly renovated as of March 13th 2016. 
I was a little afraid that the food quality would drop but it didn't. Service isn't excellent (never was), but that's to be expected of an inexpensive Chinese restaurant. 

Chinese dumpling house is starting to become a bit of franchise. There's two locations in Markham and one in Mississauga. Actually it's possible that they have a few more locations, that I don't know about. 

Dumplings here are cheap. $6.50 for 15 steamed ones. $6.99 for 12 pan fried ones. Most dishes here range from $5.99 - $ 6.99 with a few hotpot dishes that are $9.99. 

My favourites and recommendations are the steamed pork and bok choy dumplings, fried pork and bok choy dumplings, pan fried onion bread, stir fry beef noodles, braised beef noodle soup and the jellyfish appetizer. Tip: The menu says pork and cabbage in the English translation... but it's not cabbage, it's bok choy in the dish and in the Chinese literation. 

I recommend 1-2 dumpling dishes per person. They get really filling. 

The restaurant also has soya sauce if you ask for it. 

DO NOT GO TO THE LOCATION AT WARDEN AND STEELES. That location is much dirtier than this one at commerce gate. I have seen many cockroaches in the Warden and Steeles location... I'm surprised they're still open."}
{"text":"Food here is consistent and delicious. There's always a line up on the weekends. I am not sure if they take reservations but it is worth the wait regardless. 

The dumplings here are made fresh and the dough to meat portion is perfect.The dough is not overly thick and doughy or paper thin. Be careful, the steam dumplings are hot! The only thing I feel iffy about is that they reuse the parchment paper lining for the steamer. I'm sure others have probably touched it with their chopsticks....

Nonetheless, service is quick and efficient and a great place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I didn't have the greatest experience here. We got the three different steamed dumplings plate - lamb, spinach and mushrooms, and shrimp and vegetables. 

The lamb was good, the spinach and mushrooms was way too much spinach and not enough mushrooms, and there were barely any shrimp in the shrimp and veggie dumpling, or maybe it was the wrong dumplings altogether... 

We also ordered the bean curd noodles but they completely forgot about our order. 

Will prob be a while before I come back with all the dumpling places around, but when I do I'll stick to the pan fried dumplings."}
{"text":"This is newly opened in the sauga hood - with two other locations in Thornhill and Markham. We decided to visit it for Father's Day. It quickly filled up for the Sunday lunch-hour rush, but the place is spacious and clean. Single room bathrooms are large and tidy (a bonus in my books for small Chinese places).

We ordered the beef & onion pancake, chicken and mushroom dumplings, fried dumplings, and chicken fried noodles. The service is a bit slow (two people serving all the tables), but they have someone making fresh dumplings or pulling fresh noodles to distract you from your hunger. 

The pan-fried dumplings were the rockstar of the meal. The noodles ranked second due to their freshness and texture. The beef and onion pancake surprisingly was DIY, but it allowed us to see how much meat they gave you. One thing I was sad about was the XLBs. That don't exist here. Why?!.

Otherwise, the place is pretty decent, and already is pretty popular (a line out the door waiting for tables). I'll be back to try a few other things later. Hopefully some XLBs will magically appear on their menu.

Note: cash only!"}
{"text":"Average Chinese cuisine where they make the dumplings fresh on the spot. It's a good location for a quick lunch or dinner. Service isn't really the greatest but not the worse. They just come grab your ordering paper, bring out the food and stands around in case you call for something. I don't think they speak fluent English so sometimes the commutation can be a tad difficult if you do not go with a Chinese speaking companion."}
{"text":"A small little restaurant that has some of the best dumplings around! The dumplings are all made fresh in house and are amazing!

The pan fried dumplings are the best, as they are just crispy enough on the outside, but still perfectly juicy/soupy on the inside.

Service is pretty good, though servers don't really know much English. They do try and he menu has English, so its not too much trouble! The best place if your looking for good dumplings!!"}
{"text":"Same owner as the other location on Steeles, and just as good. Space is a little bit larger as well, which helps for seating. With that in mind, the table set-up is a bit odd with a large space near the door unused. 

The food is just as good as the other location, with all the dumplings handmade in house. Everything came out really quickly and was all delicious. As with the other location, I would highly recommend pretty much any of their dumplings, but the pan-fried ones are definitely my favourite!

Service is really good as well. The owner seems more active at this location, but helps out a lot overall to keep everything moving smoothly. 

Definitely recommend this (and the other) location!"}
{"text":"I suspect some of the reviews are not real because when I had it with my friend today, it was really bad. The dimplings are so sour. I thought it's just that 1 flavour is sour but no. All 3 flavours of dumplings are sour. Meat is not fresh, shrimp in the dimplings filling is not fresh, they tried to cover it up by putting vinegar in the filling so we can't taste the unfresh ingradients. Absolutely will not go back again. This is the worst dumplings place I've ever had...."}
{"text":"Uh... I get unreasonable cravings for dumplings sometimes, and I really should know better than to ever come back to this place (third time here over several years) as there are other better places in Scarborough.  I pretty much agree with everything that Jennifer K. mentions (we ate pretty much the same things too).

- Cash only
- Super cheap
- Super salty dumplings with thick, sticky skins
- Abrupt service from the one waitress, though I don't think it was meant in a rude way; just deal with it! 
- Very long wait for our food - other tables that came after us got their order first
- Super sticky condiment containers.  Ew.  Ew.  Ew.

On another note, totally unrelated, the experience was made worse because of a family of three that was sitting near us.  The son was like a caricature of an angry, aggressive 'gangsta flyboy' with dyed hair twenty-something that you would see in bad gangster movies that was loudly shouting at his mother as she kept saying things that irritated him, while the father was blithely ignoring everything that was going on (with a bluetooth in his ear too).  Sigh.  Stereotype alert.

Don't think I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Always delicious and reliable cheap eats!   I love dumplings, pot stickers and pancake wrapped with green onions and sliced beef shank.   Wait time depends on the time of day, but generally there's a lineup.   It's a very small restaurant so the table can't hold all the food you order.   Be sure to eat quick!"}
{"text":"Not the best food or service but a decent place for cheap eats. 

Came here for lunch in a group of 9 on a Friday. We were given a room at the back which was nice to have some privacy. The food was satisfactory but not outstandingly good. Their steamed pork and cabbage dumplings had little taste that I couldn't eat it without dipping sauce. The vinegar bottle was broken and we spilled as we try to get some for dipping sauce. The servers never looked after us unless we got outside of the room to request something and wasn't that helpful either. Price of dinner with tax is $10 plus tips. It's worth it if you are just looking for a quick and cheap meal but I have had better dumplings at lots of other places."}
{"text":"The dumplings here are very good, and very fresh tasting. I think they make them to order. Try the fried ones! The other dishes are just okay... but come for the dumplings! Vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5 (just okay)
Service: 2/5 (Waiter was very straight-forward which was OK, but the cashier was very rude. Service was fast though).
Note: paid at counter, order sheet photo included. 

Don't come here with high expectation about food and also service.  As soon as we sat down, waitress would give you order sheet, pencil and tea.  We ordered Shredded cucumber & pork with starch sheets, pancake with chive, dry shrimp & Egg, Pan fried meat dumplings and Stir Fried preserved veggie with pork intestines (friend wanted it). Food came really quick, they claimed in house hand made fresh dumpling, but I saw them took a bag of dumpling from freezer. My guess, pan fried dumpling used frozen dumpling instead of fresh made, but who knows.  We only liked the dumpling and chive pancake, the rest tasted decent although the starch sheet was kind of bland. 

Overall, the food was hit or miss, however the cashier was incredibly rude to us, hurting our overall experience."}
{"text":"A no-frills dumpling house. They have multitudes of different dumpling fillings and styles,from lamb to carrots, to pan-fried and steamed. You will get your dumpling fix here. The store is a bit cramped and not the cleanest, but the dumplings are definitely fresh."}
{"text":"This spot reminds me of the restaurants I used to hit with my family as a kid. No frills service and decor, amazing food.

My cousin and I have come here a couple of times to completely freak out, dumpling style. We've had beef dumplings, pork dumplings, fried and steamed. We've had the spicy lamb hot pot and the chive pancake. ALL DELICIOUS.

Get there early, the place fills up at dinner time!"}
{"text":"This place is solid. It's nothing out of the ordinary, but it's reliable. The prices are average/good, and the food comes pretty quickly. The dumplings are good, not incredible. I have also tried some of the non-dumpling meals which were, again, good. 
It's a good place where you can expect quick, cheap food."}
{"text":"Amazing value for what you pay. 

This place is pretty typical to what you'd expect from a traditional Chinese dumpling restaurant. They have a bunch of dumpling flavours to choose from and also feature some hot and cold dishes. I usually come here when I'm hungry but not wanting to pay a whole lot - you can get ~15 dumplings for roughly $6.99, which I think is pretty great! Two people can comfortably eat for under $25 for dinner. 

Note: Like most Chinese restaurants, this place only takes debit or cash."}
{"text":"It's alright, I prefer the Scarborough location more though. The interior is nicer and cleaner here but it doesn't have the Korean cuisine like its other location. Food tasted alright but the beef pancakes and potstickers are a must!!!"}
{"text":"Though it was extremely tight and packed place, food was unexpectedly great. We ordered chilli beef with rice and it was so flavourful and the meat was super tender. We also ordered pork and leak dumplings and they were extremely fresh and delicious. Food was hot and super yummy and fresh. A must try. You do have to go around on the side of the building and but it's a must try place. I guess you can tell by the amount to people coming regardless of it being cramped. Will for sure go again and try more items on their menu which by the way is quite big and many items to choose from."}
{"text":"We had fried chicken dumplings which were a bit dry, and we had vegetable dumplings and mushroom spinach dumplings. They weren't salty which was good but they tasted similar to ravioli.i enjoyed the vegetable soup which was light and simple. Service was fast, they definitely bring you the bill as soon as you put your chopsticks down, and the server was waiting and watching until we put down a tip. That experience felt a bit awkward. This place is also cash or debit only. For the price and experience, you can find juicier, and bigger dumplings at other Korean restaurants in the area with friendlier and more welcoming service."}
{"text":"We ordered the lamb dumplings, veggie and mushroom dumplings, fried rice noodles with beef, and crispy fish with rice.

We were seated promptly and the service is somewhat par for the course and typical of many Chinese restaurants.  Brisk, not always friendly, impersonal but they get the job done.  The food took awhile to come but when it came, wow.

The lamb dumplings were the star of the show.  Handmade dumplings filled with a juicy tasty ground lamb filling.  They brought the stack of steamers with the lamb dumplings in the top and the veggie ones underneath.  Freshly steamed, hot, be careful you don't bite into the lamb ones and squirt juices all over yourself!

The veggie and mushroom dumplings were also good.  The crispy fish with rice was a huge disappointment.  It looked and tasted like ground fish formed into a patty, battered and then fried and served atop a bed of raw sliced cabbage with a generous bowl of rice.

Come back for the dumplings!!"}
{"text":"Every weekend I pick a new dumpling restaurant to satisfy my discerning, and demanding, desire for dumplings.  Chinese Dumpling House won this past weekend's lottery.  Being an entirely new restaurant to me, I was sufficiently excited to trek out to north Scarborough and see what the deal is.

While their name may suggest they exclusively serve dumplings, like most of the Chinese dumpling houses in Scarborough and Markham, they have a full menu of food with the dumplings tucked into their own little category at the bottom.  The name is either a marketing ploy or an indicator of their speciality - only the food itself can decide.

The restaurant was near capacity when we arrived, but we were still seated immediately.  Only the hostess spoke English so she served us as well.

The dumplings were priced between $3.99 - $5.99 for plates of 15.  My friend and I settled with (read as: indecisively ordered everything): chive, shrimp, and egg, beef and radish, leek and pork, and chicken and mushroom dumplings.  Our order was taken promptly and we were provided all the pleasantries of efficient, but indifferent service.

While awaiting the dumplings we engaged in a conversation over the utilitarian minimalism of the restaurant.  As to be expected, the space is filled with clean plastic furniture and tables, with gifted lucky-cats and red lanterns over the counter.  Little other decoration adorns the restaurant.  We both agreed that it's better for the restaurant's interior to have no memorable presence.

The food arrived after fifteen minutes, a leaning tower of gourmet served in steamers.  The dumplings were delicious - despite being steamed, they were filled with juicy goodness.  The shrimp dumplings were salty with a nice bite of chive to them.  The chicken and mushroom dumplings leaned towards mushroom taste, with a salty burst of flavour that quickly resided to earthy.  Moving to the beef, we found it to be well spiced with starchy flavours - the radish providing a good vessel for the spicy oil and soy dipping sauce.  We were already feeling full when we pulled out the last steamer, loaded with the leek and pork, but that fullness did little to dissuade us from rapidly popping back the last 15 with smiles on our faces.

It is safe to say my dumpling experience at Chinese Dumpling House was satisfactory.  While there were no 'specialty' dumplings, or anything unexpected, what we did eat was fresh, tasty and most certainly up to par.  Plus, with a price tag of under $25 for pure gluttony (under $15 otherwise), there leaves little to complain about.

NOTE: The restaurant is a little inconspicuous.  It is not inside the mall - it is at the north end of the southern complex and is easy to miss.  If you take the northern driveway into the complex, look to the left as you drive towards the central parking lot."}
{"text":"My husband and I were drawn in from the outside by the homemade dumpling-making station that is positioned in the main window. We are very glad that we stopped! We had the pork and chive dumplings (fried) and vegetable fried rice.  Both the dumplings and fried rice were super tasty.  They were also a good value.  The decor is a little sparse, but the food is legit.  Note! They have a $10.00 minimum for credit cards, but they do not actually accept credit cards, they only accept debit cards from Canadian banks.  This threw us for a loop and we had to go to an ATM, so I wish their advertised policy was more accurate."}
{"text":"My regular go-to place for dumplings. They opens late, good option for my late night snack. Dumplings are all freshly hand made. They do offer other dishes other than dumplings. Some dishes are really good, some are so so. If I am only reviewing dumplings, I will give them a five star. You have to try their dumplings, probably one of the best in GTA, in terms of quality and price. Regular dumplings 15pcs only cost $5.99. A must try!!!!"}
{"text":"Great dumplings. Some other dishes we tried were mediocre. The thing with Chinese places is that they have a million items on their menu. The usual case is that the chefs can make some things really good, and will occasionally screw up on others. That's the case with us. I can't recall what the dish names were. They weren't terrible, just not memorable. Edible for sure. Stick with their dumplings and you won't be disappointed. There's nothing really memorable about anything here. 

Prices are very reasonable. I wouldn't mind coming again."}
{"text":"Our family of 5 went to the Dumpling House on December 31st 2015. We barely had anything to eat that day so we were all pretty hungry so we ordered 5 dishes there. We ordered a fried fish dish, dumplings, beef noodles, assortment of veggies with mushrooms dish. Little did we know it was the WORST experience our family has ever had with any restaurant by far.
(Considering my family goes out to eat 1-2 every week and we've gone to A LOT of restaurants). All 5 members of my family came down with fever which led to stomach aches and vomiting for the entire night...The food they served at Dumpling House is NOT fresh hence why all 5 of us laid in bed the whole night and could not enjoy the new years countdown. To add on, the service there was mediocre, waitress never came to our table to check up on our food or us. 

We WILL never go to the Dumpling House again. They do not serve fresh food and the prices are no better than other Chinese restaurants we've been to. Go at your own risk."}
{"text":"Still really like this place. However, the rating has dropped...
Only because every time I go, they always seem to run out of dumplings which is disappointing. 
I wanted to try the chicken and mushroom dumplings but they told me they didn't have any.
So I ended up just getting the pan fried pork dumplings, fried onion pancake and kung pao chicken. 

Pan Fried Pork Dumplings - it's an extra $1 to get it pan fried. Only one side was fried and the other wasn't (so odd).
I didn't like that one side of the dumpling was slightly crisp while the other was soggy and watery. Did not like the combination of oily and watery either. The filling was good other wise.

Fried Onion Pancake - this was absolutely delicious. A little greasy but still sooo good!

Kung Pao Chicken - I don't know what happened today but it lacked a little bit in flavour. Still good, but not as great when I first ordered it."}
{"text":"Holy moley its packed in here.  We came on a weekday during lunch and its pppaacckked.  They seated us next to strangers!  So weird.  But i guess it beats waiting.  Hahaha.  We later asked if we could move for more privacy when other table left.  They were cool with it. The prices seem pretty good. Green onion pancake was not what we expected but tastes delightful.  It looks like a donut. Place is very small and tight.  They clearly have a space issue.  They have to put dishes by the window.   The venue itself isn't ugly or anything. Granite tables and nice tile flooring. The exterior can fool you.  Exterior is quite ugly.  Dont judge a book by its cover!  

   Food was really good. Very tastey. If your a dumpling fan.  This place is a must try.

I will definitely be back.

{"text":"I have yet to find a Chinese Dumpling restaurant that lives up to my standards.  I think that the defining factor of a good dumpling lies in the dumpling wrapper.  With that said, I found the Chinese Dumpling House wrappers to be too thick.  We had the Pork & Bok Choy Dumplings, steamed.  The filling was good.  We also ordered the Beef, Shrimp & Egg Fried Rice which was pretty standard.  I liked the fact that it wasn't too oily.  Nice and light.  It came served up with a side of Sweet & Sour Soup, which was a tad on the spicy side for my liking. 

The service was terrible.  We asked for the bill, and then after 10 minutes of waiting, we asked for it again - she had totally forgotten!

If you can't even get your specialty dish right, you shouldn't call yourself a dumpling house. :p"}
{"text":"No idea what were the items ordered since my parents took the wheel for this one. I just sat and ate, teehee.

Their restaurant space is small but they made it work with marble tables and Chinese style chairs... The walkway area was really tight though. Tea was offered and there were several type of sauces to fit your taste - vinegar, soya sauce and even chili oil!

This was another version of a pancake, with leeks and green onion inside. It was pretty good and chewy. Unfortunately, the leek taste was really strong for me, so I only ate one. I saw a lot of tables ordering this dish though! So I bet it must be really popular.

These pan fried pork dumplings were a must! It tasted so good and fresh off the grill too! The last time I had really good pan fried pork dumplings was in Chinatown a few years ago. Drizzle a bit of soya sauce on this baby and you're good to chow down!

We also got the steamed dumplings or known as ??? xiao long bao in Chinese. There were many types of steamed dumplings here - different types of meat and vegetables combined.

All the steamed dumplings/??? comes in orders of 15 in one of these big Chinese steamers... so be careful when ordering or you could take the food back home and eat some more when you're hungry~
The trick with ??? is to eat it all in one bite but because it was steaming hot, it was almost impossible to do so.

Every ??? comes with a bit of soup inside the dumpling, which is why it's best to eat it in one bite. But with the dumplings being hot, I like to split the top part of the dumpling so the heat gets out and it'll cool off.

We ordered two different types of ???.
One is Pork with Mushrooms, another was either Pork or Chicken with Leek. Leek is pretty popular when it comes to dumplings... not sure why that's the case, perhaps the fragrance of the leek brings the harmony of the dumplings together.

The ??? wasn't anything spectacular but it was decent enough. I really enjoyed the pan-fried dumplings more! But the problem with every pan-fried dumpling is that you can taste the oil/grease(?) when eating them... tastes almost sinful, but it's worth it every time.

I would also recommend not coming during the dinner time on a weekend because we came here on a weekend for dinner and was lucky enough to get a big table (there weren't many). We also came earlier around 5-6pm in order to make sure we get a spot. Midway while eating, there was patrons waiting for tables already!

Tiny area, but definitely had so so many different options of dumplings and fillings, it's amazing!! Definitely a hidden gem :)"}
{"text":"Chinese Dumpling house is located in one of the oldest Asian plazas Commerce Gate in Markham among many other restaurants. I personally love Chinese dumplings so we come here quite often. Let's take a look at a few of our favourite dishes!

Sliced Pork Belly With Garlic Soy Sauce
For starters, we ordered the pork belly cold dish. This is a classic Sichuan dish that is very well known. The pork has a good distribution of fat and meat but it was not the smoothest and softest pork belly we had. The garlic and soy sauce was very flavorful but I wish the garlic was less chunky. A finer grind would give the dish a better distribution of flavour.  

Meat Balls in Hot Pot (AKA Lion's head) 
This hot pot consists of giant ground pork meat balls known as lion's head, nappa cabbage, vermicelli glass noodles, red dates and green onions in a special broth. Lion Head is another classic Eastern Chinese dish that I've always loved since I was a kid. This meat ball cooked in a savory broth was one of our favorite dish from this meal. The meatball had a perfect texture that wasn't too stiff or too mushy. We had it as if it were a soup and it was delicious!   

Spicy Grilled Fish
I am not a big fan of fish but this dish was an exception. It was fried to a crunchy coat and soft meat  and everything down to the bones were edible.

Shredded Cucumber and Pork with Starch Sheets
This appetizer is a popular classic North Eastern Chinese cold dish. It consists of a translucent starch noodle mixed with some pork, cucumber, carrot, eggs, parsley and black fungus topped with sesame/ peanut sauce and soy sauce to taste. This is one of my favourite dishes as it is very refreshing for a hot summer day. The portion was larger than I expected too, very good for sharing.

Steamed Pork and Chives Dumplings
There are many different varieties of handmade dumplings to choose from at the Dumpling House but the pork and chives dumpling is our all time favorite! They come out fresh from the steamer and hot soup oozes out once you take the first bite. I can never get enough of dumplings."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of time and it's been a place that we go back now and again. The major highlight of the place is their affordable dumplings...especially love their seafood dumplings. The rest are good but pretty forgettable. The menu is extensive but gets boring quite fast. The meat dishes are a bit pricier than typical Chinese, but it's a nice addition to the meal. The dumplings are good when they are hot but can be a bit edits to east once it cools, the skin gets tough and the texture becomes doughy. I personally like eating the dumplings with a sauce thus ask for sugar, soy sauce and add vinegar and hot chilli or satay oil. Bon appetite. Overall, I would recommend anyone woth a budget (for dumplings) or for those that wanna try northern Chinese region food."}
{"text":"Came for lunch today, some things are not as good as usual. The hot and sour soup was too salty, sour but not spicy enough. The minced pork and bean paste noodle was too salty too. Even when mixed with the plain noodle and cucumbers, it was too salty. The pan fried dumplings and chinese chive pancakes were both good. The best dish was the beef shank pancake dish. It's great how you assemble the pancakes yourself, adding your own prefered amount of beef, green onion and hoi sin sauce. 
Nice place to go but if you have high blood pressure, I wouldn't bother."}
{"text":"Finding parking spots in this plaza is a miracle! But the dumplings are worth the wait. The satay eggplant is a must try."}
{"text":"Food is cheap service is fast. Ambiance is lacking obviously since it's like a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant. But i think that was the feel they were going for in order to offer their customers cheaper prices. The food was really good and for the price that you pay it's pretty worth it. We had lots of dumplings for 4 people. Some of the noodle dishes and also the cold dishes were excellent. I have nothing but a good review for this Dumpling House because anyone can eat here without having to feel pretentious. The food is honest and fairly quick if you're super hungry.

Con:
Though this does not relate to the restaurant itself but the Plaza is really difficult to find parking space. I noticed most of the drivers coming to this Plaza can't even drive and end up honking at each other constantly LOL. Just a word of advice if you're coming during Peak dinner time then I would come a little bit early before 7 otherwise it's pretty hard to get a parking space here."}
{"text":"I was going to try Chilli Chicken House tonight (since it has such good reviews) but could not get in and takeout will be a 45min wait. :(

Finally, I walked around the plaza and stumbled upon this place. It looks decent from the outside so I went in. Menu is extensive so I ordered takeout and they said 15min! Done! 4 stars not 3

 My order:
Jelly fish + cucumber - mediocre, but large portion, jelly fish is very crunchy (Isn't it suppose to be blanched in hot water, then marinated and not completely raw? I'm more use to eating the traditional style i.e. cooked, seasoned, elastic texture.)
King mushroom + veggies - good
Spicy beef tendon - good, never seen this before
Spicy eggplant - good, no meat (love it)
Sweet & sour fish - good, fish pieces could be larger
Plain rice - standard, fresh

I actually liked this place. I didn't dine in but it was pretty roomy with lots of seating. Food was good, not too salty, not loaded with MSG, not too spicy, just flavoured for your average palate, and large portions. Service was prompt, courteous, and efficient. Price was fair value. You see a lot of different cultures dining in as a family, which is a good sign.

I will return to try other stuff on their menu and perhaps dine in."}
{"text":"$6 for 15 steamed dumplings and $5 for 6 pan fried dumplings...the dumplings are good... ive definitely had better but they are certainly very decent for the price ... the chive and egg pancake is nice and crispy... our group of 6 shared 5 orders of various steamed dumplings, 2 orders of pan fried dumplings, a noodle dish, the chive & egg pancake and scallion & leek cake roll.we all left satisfied ... final bill came to $81.00 which is good value per person...this place is worth a try if ur with a bunch of friends, super hungry and want good bang for ur buck!

final rating: 3/5 stars"}
{"text":"Good food. Traditional northern Chinese cuisine. Dumplings made fresh in house and is filled with savoury toppings and food...comes out piping hot. The stir fried udon like noodles were deliciously fresh but a bit too oily. The hot pot looks good but we did not try it. Only downside is the food took a bit longer in comparison to similar joints."}
{"text":"We just stumbled upon this restaurant. Amazing dumplings, we got the spinach, vegetable and lamb combo. Their dumplings are made fresh to order and great tasting. We also tried the general tao's chicken and vegetable shanghai noodles. Very good food :)"}
{"text":"So for those with traditional Asian parents, they probably won't like this place because your mom will think she can do better lol.  However, putting everything into perspective, it's pretty good.

Likes: 
-Dumplings are cheap and delicious. You get 15 for 5.99 and they are huge.  Some are slightly more expensive (e.g. lamb is 7.99).
-They have 20 or so different kinds of dumplings.
-Big menu with 100+ items

Dislikes:
-Dumplings are only prepared by one person so it takes around 15-20 minutes to arrive.  
-Their other non-dumpling dishes are fairly small for a Chinese restaurant
-No XLB (soup dumplings)

Verdict: overall, I still like this place and I think it's a great place for those who want traditional Chinese dumplings, great choice. If you would rather have anything but dumplings, there are better choices in Mississauga. #Dumpling love"}
{"text":"Dumplings made in house. Great dumplings, still need to try others, but saw the green onion pancake it looks quite bready... Facility is interesting, but don't look for fine dining here. During the visit, their fire alarm went off so the owner decided to cover it with cloth and tape.. and It's been taped up before too, so... other than that food is cooked well and kitchen is pretty visible. Dumplings taste homemade as well, but if you're looking for XLBs they don't offer them here. ):"}
{"text":"We always order the hot & sour soup and their pan fried dumplings. To be honest all their dumplings are amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this place, came here with my boyfriend to try something new. Went there early, 30 mins after they opened. I ordered their lamb dumplings, and loved it. It was hot, freshly made and juicy.  Took a bite of the dumpling and the juice just gushed into my mouth. The dumpling was very flavorful. I also ordered the pork & leek dumplings, and the beef & mushroom hot pot. Their pork & leek dumpling was good but not as great as their lamb dumplings. The beef & mushroom hot pot was good. The service was good. The server understands English, their menus are in Chinese and English. The place was quiet, and not too busy. So going early is good. I would be definitely me coming back. Yes, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have to agree with my buddy Kyle in the previous post. The dumplings here are really good! 

I went yesterday and I think they renovated their tables, so it looks a bit classier, but it's still as small as ever.

On top of the dumplings, we also had the pot stickers and hot and sour soup. Both were really good. The fried onion dough, like Kyle said was a miss, so skip that.

Make sure that if you are ordering something to go that you do it way beforehand. My mother decided not to place it until close to the end of our meal and we ended up having to wait a very long time for it."}
{"text":"This spot is a hidden gem. I will definitely come back! They have quite the variety of dumplings - hand made and delicious! Everything we ordered was well prepared,  and a great value. Loved the family style tofu. Recommended as cheap eats!"}
{"text":"this is the first time I've had pan fried dumplings where they were all connected together.  It looked like they were serving me a pancake except if you looked under, you'd see all this lumps which were the dumplings!!!  To get it crisp like that..you obviously need a bit of oil so they are abit greasy but that's what the vinegar is for to help cut the grease.
I ordered 1 set steamed and 1 set pan fried..no complains..good price for what you get.  Though they wanted me to pay cash instead of using the credit card even though they take credit cards. But worth going if I have a craving for old-style dumplings."}
{"text":"Their wontons, dumplings, spicy spinach is my go to! It's not the cleanest place (they've been reported before and I think it's become better), but it's cheap and their food is tasty."}
{"text":"Damn my ratings have been as generous as the food served at Chinese Dumpling House. Dishing out them 5 stars like this place dishes out dumplings.  I value two things in life: a bank account that's not in the red, and good food. My family has the same idea which is why every time we come here, we lose all sense of self control and order 2/3 of the menu. Those prices! That flavour!

My favourite things are very simple: pan fried long dumplings, and cold century eggs with soy sauce and cilantro. Fried dumplings are my vice and the ones here are juicy and delicious. I unashamedly ordered and finished a plate of these babies by myself. Multiple times. No regrets. On the other hand, cold century eggs offer the best flavour/texture contrast with everything else on the table and I always have to order these. Be warned that century eggs have a very peculiar taste/smell/look and isn't for everyone.

Honourable mentions include: 
1) Beef noodle soup - classic, comforting, noodles
2) Green onion pastry circle thing - literally a circle of delicious, flavourful dough.
3) Spicy fried fish - crispy exterior, soft interior: the fish version of tsundere.

To be honest, I haven't come here in awhile so I don't remember the rest of the menu items we've ordered but I do remember it all being pretty good. After writing this review and remembering how much I miss this place though, you can bet my broke ass that I'm coming back within the week.

{"text":"Apparently this place is a Northern Mainland Chinese eatery, different from the typical Cantonese restaurants out there in that they mainly focus on having a lot of meat, and not much vegetables on their meat dishes and dumplings. The dumplings are made in restaurant patrons' eye view.  There are fifteen dumplings per order ranging from 5 dollars to 8 dollars.  The lamb dumplings were really delicious.  They have a lot of meat dishes spiced with cumin.  They have interesting soups and hot pot.  During this occasion, I tried the herbal chicken stew which was really good.  Also tried a tofu dumpling which was interesting. This is a great place to go when you have a group so that you can sample many dishes at one time.  

If you love trying new things and love Chinese food, then check this place out.

Note: The food took a long time to come out, we ordered about fourteen dishes, but the restaurant forgot to provide two dishes, a fish dish and a pork dish.  When asked if they were coming, they stated that there were no outstanding orders.  Perhaps this is really a 3.5, as they forgot orders.  This wouldn't deter me from coming back though because I really like the variety of their menu."}
{"text":"This was me and my hubbys first time going to a Chinese dumpling house. We loved it! 

We tried the pork, shrimp and leek. The filling was so tasty and the dumpling shell was nice and doughy. 

We also tried to beef and broccoli which was so succulent and was amazing with rice.

The hot and sour soup tasted a tiny bit watered down to us but we like really fragrant and vinegar-y tasting hot and sour soup (like the one you get downtown at Hwa Sing). I just added a bit more vinegar to mine and it was good! 

The waitress was nice and food came promptly after ordering. We also brought our baby (who was a bit fussy) but we didn't feel unwelcome because of it. 

If we're in the area, we would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We showed up and they were packed so they reserved a table for us in 15 minutes time. We left and came back in less than 15 minutes and ended up giving away our table. I got the chilli beef and the flavor was bitter and boring. I ordered a water and the glass was dirty. We got dumplings as a group and the dumplings were soggy and fell apart. This place is not a good place to go for dumplings or Chinese food. Much better options nearby."}
{"text":"Nice little place in the Metro Square plaza if you're in the mood for some cheap Chinese food. There are pictures beside many of the items on the menu which helps a lot if you don't know Chinese. 

I got the fried noodles which were pretty basic. Didn't taste like much unless I added A LOT of soy sauce, vinegar sauce, or hot sauce to it. I specifically came for the dumplings because I read such great reviews about it - ordered the pan fried pork dumplings (6 pcs) and the beef and raddish dumplings (15 pcs). Very reasonable prices, as the whole bill came to $20 for my friend and I. We were full at the end with leftovers. The dumplings were okay, no complaints, but not something I would go around raving about. 

As for the service, the workers seem nice but don't talk to you much. It's really difficult to communicate if you don't know Cantonese or Mandarin. Awkward!"}
{"text":"Any kind of dumplings and their cong you bing (circular shaped) are DELICIOUS. I'd stick to their specialties ^ and not anythjng from the big menu they have. Just have those is more than enough"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best dumpling houses in the GTA. They give you a bang for your buck, 15 dumplings which you can see hand made as you walk in, and served in a traditional bamboo steamer for less than $6.99. 

2 downsides - 

1. Wait times
it's popularity combined with its tiny size results in there forever being a line-up. Plus there isn't much space to wait in in the first place. Depending on your group size, it can take forever.

2. The staff.
As you're waiting, you can see the servers working really slowly, which definitely adds up to them losing profit. The food is amazing, the staff (mostly ~30y.o. Chinese women) definitely need to step it up. Their attitude isn't too good either, but then again, the style of this restaurant isn't the equivalent to that of say Milestone's. 

However, we are regular customers when we're in the area.

Definitely order the pork/leek dumplings. They're a crowd favourite.
Also, the pan fried onion pancakes and the spring pancakes. (Though the ratio of spring onions to dough in the spring pancakes seems to be lacking the last few times I've been here..)
Oh, my family also always orders the beef brisket noodles. It's hard to find a place that does them right, and here's a restaurant that knows their noodles! The broth isn't too salty, and the noodles soak up just enough of it to (a) not be mushy (b) have a bit of flavour. The beef brisket itself is well-done, flavourful, and tender.

Hands down I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Dumplings went up to $5.99 for 15. Still a good deal. They make them fresh, so no problems there. Their hot pots are a good deal. They start around the $8.99 range (beef and mushrooms) and portion-wise, they're really good. Had the beef one today. Apparently, it's one of my bestie's go-to dishes. Lots of beef, enoki mushrooms, tomato slices, a few bunches of konnyaku (yam noodles tied in knots), bean sprouts, etc."}
{"text":"My go to dumpling place in Richmond Hill.  How can you not serve good dumplings with a name like this!       Not sure what to say but try them all!  Serving size is pretty good and the skin not overly thick or thin.  I come here lots and have never been disappointed.
You should also try the green onion cake too.
Parking may be your only challenge here!"}
{"text":"My name is Arlene and I am addicted to dumplings :( Seriously though, for me there is nothing quite like a nicely pan fried pork dumpling, or soup dumpling, especially when it is good value for what you pay. I enjoy dipping them in a mixture of soy sauce and vinegar (which I find adds interest and helps cut the greasiness). 

I've been to the Chinese Dumpling House at Steeles and Warden many times with hubby before we got married but this is the first time eating at this location. It is definitely more presentable than its sister restaurant to the south (which is a hole in the wall). 

We ordered our favourites which included snow pea tips sautéed in garlic, lean fried pieces of pork (which comes with a salt/spice mixture that I'm wary of eating too much of for fear of MSG), and pan fried pork dumplings. Oh the greasy, crunchy, chewy, porky goodness! 

We ate until we were full and still had enough leftovers for lunch. All this (including a bowl of steamed rice) for $28.30! Cash only. Would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys dumplings and cheap eats!

{"text":"I had the baked squid dish, and my wife had the cabbage and pork soup.  They were both excellent.  I looked around to see what people were eating, and their dishes look fresh, clean, and tasty.  We will be back for more for sure.  Serving staff was helpful and prompt especially considering it was a Chinese restaurant.

========================================
Went there again, and the food was mediocre;basically what this means is your experience will be based on what you order.

Disappointing dumpling for sure - Bibigo dumplings I bought at Costco, or dumplings sold at T&T market taste better than these.  I went with 12 people, and some of the people I went with are from mainland China, and they agreed that dumplings at this place are mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Impressive experience at the Chinese Dumpling House. We got take out and for the most part, only had good things to say.

Started with the pork and chive fried dumplings, which were really great. I mean the name of the place made me have high expectations in the dumpling department, but they were easily met if not exceeded by these tasty things. 

Dumplings aside: The general tso chicken was good and had sliced jalapenos in it which added a nice kick. Singapore noodles pretty standard but satisfying, and while I normally steer clear of sweet and sour chicken - in this case it wasn't sweetness overkill like most places so I did admittedly snack on my dining companions choice. Pork fried rice was the only thing that didn't really impress, but wasn't bad either.

In short: worth trying, and probably the best dumplings in Koreatown!"}
{"text":"awesome dumpling house!

cheap fresh hand-made dumplings in all flavors you can think of! you can get them steamed or panfried. the owner's super nice. you might want to go with someone that speak chinese. lots of other dishes too if you feel like having something ON THE SIDE.

fav things: garlic sauce eggplant, green onion pancake, tofu stew."}
{"text":"For a dumpling house, I thought they were just decent. Thumbing through the photos, they looked pretty appetizing, especially the pot stickers, but unfortunately, only the pot stickers lived up to my expectations.

We ordered the pork and cabbage pot stickers (1 order = 6 pieces, $6.99), lamb steamed dumplings (1 order = 15 pieces, $6.99), stir-fry bean sprouts with garlic ($7.95). 

Great flavors in the pot stickers with a little bit of \"juice\". I only wish that they were a little more crispy, but the skin texture was excellent; just the right amount of chew and spring without being too thick or thin. 

The lamb dumplings were flavorful and pungent, but it was over steamed. Some of the skins had already punctured and were a little too soft and watery, making the filling spill out. If you're not a fan of eating lamb, I'd avoid because the smell (while we absolutely love) was particularly strong for such a small dumpling. Mixed in was pickled cabbage with a good tartness. A little too meaty for the mixture, as it would have been nice if there was more cabbage mixed in. We weren't crazy when we found a piece of hair hanging off the side of the steamer, so even though we don't like to waste food, we were weary of every bite.

The bean sprouts stir fry was refreshing without being oily or salty. Loved the crisp tender bite and the small slivers of garlic throughout. It provided a good balance to the heavier dumplings.

Overall, it wasn't bad, but it certainly could have been better. Having been spoiled with the refined dumpling from Din Tai Fung in Taiwan and China, this place was comforting, but lacked a little finesse in the filling to wrapper ratio. Good service, and love the fact that as you enter the restaurant, you see two ladies making fresh wrappers and wrapping dumplings."}
{"text":"We had ordered 30 dumplings that took approximately 30 minutes to arrive. Considering they were fresh, it was a reasonable amount of time to wait. Dumplings however were just alright. $5.99 for 15 was a very price."}
{"text":"The other location shut down due to a failed health inspection... but as an asian, do we care THAT much? \"Is you dead? No? Then shut up\" is honestly the line my mother would've used on me if I refused to go somewhere because of that. This has quite a few spaces but it's usually packed, especially on the weekend. It looks like china on the inside. As in, nobody speaks english (barely even cantonese) AND there are chinese lanterns everywhere..

Service is fast and blunt. Typical, who cares? Food can come out slowly during a rush but nothing unbearable.

Dumplings are nom. Dumplings must be one of my favourite asian foods because I always crave them. They handmake them in front of you and they're fresh af as well as cheap af. WHICH IS IMPORTANT! $6-7 for 15 dumplings? Um, my stomach is happy, as well as my wallet. I always get the veggie/mushroom dumplings (both panfried and steamed.. my inner fatty tells me to, ok. DON'T JUDGE ME, YA MUGGLE) and I devour them so fast.. they're pretty large and filling! Super delicious, for all my vegan/vegetarians out there! This is a dumpling spot for you. 

Friends tell me their pork dumplings and pot stickers are hella good too, while my other friend is obsessed with their hot and sour soup because it's better than other places.. like t&t's soup bar.

Miss vegan sassqueen approved, for the most part!

Ps... the plates sometimes look a bit dirty, but I don't know ..  typical asians usually don't eat off their plate so I'm not sure if those are dishwasher stains or.."}
{"text":"My second time going was yesterday and it was equally as good as the first time. It's busy but we didn't have to wait long for the steaming hot food. 

First order:
Pork and leeks dumplings
Beef and fried pancake wraps
lamb and oyster hot pot

Second Order:
Pork and cabbage dumplings
beef and fried pancake wrap
spicy lamp hotpot
friend pork dumplings

All the food was hot, tasty and good portion sizes. The beef pancakes came with 6 pieces of pancake the first time and 4 large ones the 2nd time... would have preferred the consistency since there were 6 of us the 2nd time X_x

The dumplings had a lot of filling and they had the hot sauce and vinegar on the table for dipping. Don't be over zealous like my friend was and burn your tongue!

The 2 hot pots were jam packed full of meat but i feel like they are missing some flavor, maybe because I'm used to my dipping sauce for chinese hot pot. 

The menu is huge and I'm excited to go back and try some more rare dishes! 

Service has been good both times and there seems to be more than enough servers. Where else can you get a huge meal for less than $9 after tax and tips!"}
{"text":"This place is a favourite of my dad's and the food here is pretty good.  I think what also gets my dad through the door is the reasonable prices.

The restaurant is small and when it's full, you'll notice. Also, if you have a group of 6 or more, there is only one large round table in the whole restaurant and it is by the front door so be aware.

Other than that, the food is very tasty so no disappointment there. The food also comes out quick.  I think it also helps to have someone who can read or communicate in Chinese in your group as they seem to have a number of special items posted on the wall and they aren't written in English.

Plenty of parking in Metro Square but it does get very busy during peak times like the weekend at lunch."}
{"text":"Great steamed dumplings.
Small tables but have a couple of large tables for larger groups.
Good prices for menu items.
Large selection with good size portions."}
{"text":"Chinese Dumpling House is solid but unspectacular place for dumplings that will get it done when you're craving dumplings. I would come here for a cheap, no frills kind of Chinese meal. 

Their menu is very English friendly so those who don't know Chinese can actually get by easily! But the best part is that their menu is really comprehensive in terms of having pictures for many of their items, which corresponds to the number on the ordering sheet. Good stuff!

$6.50 for 15 dumplings in many varieties seem like a pretty good deal. We tried the beef and radish, and and some pork dumplings, and well as the larger pan-fried dumplings, and beef noodles. 

For the dumplings, the beef ones were definitely better than the pork ones and they were way juicier, not only with the soup inside them, but also in terms of the meat itself. The pan-fried dumplings were very good as well but could be a tad crispier. The beef noodles were also good, however beef and vegetables were on the skimpier side. Then again, it was only around $7 for a large portion. 

No real complaints with this place, it's not going to impress but if you're craving dumplings and are in the vicinity, Chinese Dumpling House is a safe choice to come to."}
{"text":"A really simple typical dumpling restaurant that was just what you expect from a place like this. 

I don't think I'll ever be impressed with dumplings themselves but they were probably average/below average here. We didn't exactly eat them quickly but they went stone cold and were really unpleasant to eat after a while. The pan fried dumplings could have been a bit more crisp too. I was the most impressed with the pancake with beef shank. Although it's not a wrap here and everything was deconstructed, the pancake was just so crisp and I enjoyed eating it like a pizza.There's a lot to go around too. Lastly the fried pork loin was also decent. But do beware of the spice + msg they put on the side. I like it but I know there's a few people who swear against it.

Service, menu, and the rest of the place was all what you expect from your standard chinese restaurant. Huge plus for having the entire menu in English and MOST items with a corresponding picture in another menu. Staff also spoke good English to boot."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed during my second visit. Horrible, horrible service. The server gave us cut eye and served us water in an emptied-out soy bean drink jug behind a sink (we were close enough to see where they got the water from). They also talked smack behind our backs just because we were speaking in English amongst ourselves (I spoke to them in Mandarin, the language that they were speaking in). The food was still good but with the treatment that we've received, they deserve a 1 star. There are better northern Chinese restaurants out there with better service and food."}
{"text":"This place has the best dumplings I have had so far in Toronto. I love all of their dumplings, especially the vegetarian ones. The \"Chinese leek dumpling\" is wonderful. Although it's deep fried instead of pan fried, the fillings are just so yummy that I can't stop eating them.

Contrary to what others have said in their past reviews, I think the restaurant's service has improved greatly. I went around 6 when the sun was about to set, and the owner lady proactively came over to help me close the blinds. She returned multiple times to refill our tea pot although we were done eating and there were lots of people waiting for a table. You will normally be rushed out in other Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Popular for their dumplings and Northern Chinese dishes if you are around the area but probably not worth a detour. 

You can expect several things here: relatively consistent quality, authentic northern Chinese flavours and a reasonably priced menu. So this is a good option if you are ever out of ideas of what you want to eat that day and want a no frills go to place with a ton of choices.

The dumpling skins are made in house and therefore understandably thicker than other dumplings that you may be used to. Some people like it and some don't (myself included!) so I think it just depends on your preference. 

If you are going for the dumplings I recommend trying the pork with fennel (ie. dill). I have grandparents with northern background so I've been eating dumplings since I was 2 and have never tried having dill in dumplings before.. And it was surprisingly good! Interesting flavours that is unlike the combo with chives or cabbage. 

3 stars overall may mean I am too spoiled by all the scrumptious Chinese food around Richmond Hill.. So I think it's definitely worth checking out if you manage your expectations and you may end up finding yourself a new go to resto."}
{"text":"Great stuff in my neighborhood, but just a llittle heavy handed on the salt in the General Tsao's chicken dish."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times, really enjoy the steam dumplings especially the chicken, the beef not so crazy about.  Usually can get a seat even at busy times.  The green onion pan cake and fried dumplings are great too can't go wrong with these choices."}
{"text":"I come to this Dumpling House occasionally, mainly because their dumplings are one of the best in Scarborough and Markham area.

They give you 15 FRESH dumplings for just 4.99$ which is a lot. Other than their dumplings, I usually also order their beef noodles, stir-fried eggplants and leek bun which are good, but sometimes the leek bun might be a bit greasy. I like to point out that they actually make their own noodle, thus, the noodle has this very interesting texture when you chew on it.

The only downfall here is probably their service and the environment of the restaurant. If you are into dumplings and you want to find one that is relatively cheap. This one is the one to go to!"}
{"text":"It's rather a shame that I have to write this review.  Being a lover of northern Chinese dumplings and the supporter of local mom's and pop's shop,  I was so psyched to have found this place in this first visit. I ordered 1x steamed,  1x pan fried dumplings with hot and sour soup and beef and green pepper on rice.  Food is pretty good and it's great value! Only gripe i had for what i've ordered was that for steamed dumplings, the skin was too thick that it reminded me of perogies.  Other than that, good food, great deal! By the end of my meal with a friend, we couldn't stop talking about how we will come back here again and again. 

When time came to pay the bill,  the place looked rather busy so I decided to go up to the cash register to pay to save myself some time and save the server trips to our table.  I paid by interact and upon completing the transaction,  i received the receipt from the debit machine.  Then I had asked for the original receipt from the tilt to a young lady who was working at the register. She did not respond to my request at all but thinking that she heard me,  I waited for about 2 min and then asked again.  At this point,  all hell broke loose. This young lady just lost her s**t and shouted out \"You wait! I'm busy\" x3 that literally attracted the attention of 90% filled restaurant and all its customers. I calmly told her that I wasn't sure if you heard me as I've been waiting here without any response from her for almost 2 min. And then she repeated \"I'm busy,  can't you see?\".   

They seem to do alot of deliveries thru Just Eat and during this time,  she was sorting take out orders while I was waiting patiently but such an uncalled for reaction from her literally slapped all the dumplings out of my mouth with displeasure and borderline anger.  To make the matter worse,  there seemed to be others (about 3 older ladies that were part of the staff, perhaps owner(s) or even managers) that saw the whole thing unfold and NOBODY cared to do anything what so ever...  *sigh*  

The food I'd fairly give 3.5/5 but service is 0/5 and most likely,  due to this experience,  I'd  never go back to this, what could've been my 'goto' dumpling Restaurant in the city. It truly is a sad moment as this experience reminded me of what is equivalent to Allen Iverson wasting away his career due to his crappy attitude.  What a waste...."}
{"text":"Only a day before I was at Dumpling House Restaurant on Spadina, where I was blown away.  Once I have something I really like, I tend to fixate and have the same thing over and over until I get the obsession out of my system--a rebalancing of sorts.  When I noticed the Chinese Dumpling House in Richmond Hill, I thought it was an offshoot of the same treasure on Spadina. The name is fairly similar.

I walked into the small restaurant and noticed they too had a glass booth where ladies where making fresh dumplings.  This looked right so far!  Then I noticed the menu was distinctly different than Spadina, but still, a dozen dumplings for $7 is a win.  This time I added my favourite Green Beans with Minced Pork, to make sure I had a big enough meal.

This is not the same as Spadina, but still very good.  The dumplings were fresh, hot and delicious.  The bean dish was also right up there.  Now I had to figure how I would compare the two dumpling restaurants on my decision tree.  The bottom line is that if I am not willing to make the drive into the big city, this will be  my frequent go-to.  I expect to be here often, and will hit Spadina whenever I am in the core."}
{"text":"The dumplings here are very good - you get 15 dumplings for around $7 and honestly I'm full by the 5th dumpling.. they're just so good you want to keep stuffing your face (which is really bad I know). My only complaint is that they never have vinegar for the dumplings... which is kinda ridic. They do however have a sweet/spicy chili sauce which is okay, I prefer the authentic vinegar sauce instead."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week.  You have to order the crispy sweet and sour pork.  I know I know but trust me on this.  All the dumplings are made fresh to order and really good."}
{"text":"Rating: 2.5

I have been here recently and I just can't help but notice how bad they have really gotten. Back in the day, their food tasted quite good and fresh. I'm actually not a fan of their dumplings just because I DO prefer to eat less thick-skinned dumplings, but they weren't bad and my fam really seems to like them. From our recent visit, we've noticed that the dumplings were not good anymore. The meat was red (i don't if it wasn't cooked thoroughly OR WHAT BUT IT WAS RED.) and it was very gritty? No bueno to say the very least. Their beef and mushroom hotpot thing is a staple food item I always get and wow, I just can't believe how awful the beef was. The beef meat was clearly not FRESH at all. It was so bad no joke. It was kind of equivalent to chewing on rubber. (Not that I have ever tried chewing on rubber before, but yall get me right? ;D) The only good thing about them is their red bean paste fried roll? I'm not entirely sure what it's called but yeah, it's still alright. Best eaten when piping hot ~ 

So, would I recommend this place?
No. Not at all. They have raised the prices for many of their food items and what you get is not worth it at all. Taste wise and quantity wise."}
{"text":"This is a gem of a place. Very homey with a family restaurant feel. You can watch the staff make the dumplings. The service is a bit meh but the food and prices make up for it."}
{"text":"Good neighborhood Chinese place. Good service, good quality, fast. All the dumplings are made in house up front."}
{"text":"This is a popular, busy dumpling place. Being a dumpling restaurant, their dumplings are freshly made as you can see the ladies wrapping them up near the kitchen. The steamed dumplings are yummy and there are a good selection to choose from- various pork choices, beef, lamb, chicken and vegetarian. Their pork fried dumplings  are tasty and crispy. I recommend the fried dumplings with pork and leek. The price for these items are really cheap from $3.99 to approx. $5 per dish. The value is all there since you get 15 steamed dumplings in a bamboo steamer.
The reason that this place got a 3 star is because of their noodle dish. We ordered pickled vegetables with shredded pork noodle soup. The noodles you could tell was freshly made and pretty standard and good; however the soup and topping was not at all. It was tasteless and super bland. I really expected more from this as many dumpling places also serve this item. 
Don't get me wrong, I have been here before and we do enjoy their dumplings, but for some reason the noodles do not impress...and we always order noodles..
Hope to be back for more dumplings and maybe we will try some of the spicy dishes!

Side note, be prepare to wait on weekends!"}
{"text":"I don't know why people give this place low stars. Is it the best I've ever had? No! But is it pretty darn awesome for the ONLY real option in Mississauga for Legit handmade dumplings on the spot? Heck yeah!!!!! 

I highly recommend you give them a try, totally hit the spot and I didn't have to drive all the way into the city on a Sunday night!

Keep in mind they often seek out of certain ones especially their seafood based ones :("}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday evening with some friends and family, Chinese Dumpling House focuses on traditional cuisine with some inspirations from the north and south (Cantonese).
Though the place inside isn't much to look at, locals sure know where the go-to place is for some comfort food, especially dumplings, which are made in house and fresh. 
Our party of 5 ordered an array of dishes:
Pork and Leek dumpling dumplings
Pork and pickled cabbage dumplings
Pork and celery dumplings
Fried pork dumplings
Steamed greens
Spicy Beef
Crispy beef 
Green onion pancake
House soup.
If I had to OMIT, I'd choose the crispy beef, it was overly fried with a lot of batter. 

Overall their portions are huge and their prices are reasonable (even though Markham/ Scarborough) is a tad bit cheaper and just as good :)"}
{"text":"Its my 2nd time coming here this week, and so far its good enough for me to post on YELP. 
If you love dumplings, you'll love it....over 15 types of dumplings, it's definitely cute and homey.  The place is clean, and most most MOST of all it's all home made and fresh and affordable !!! Even their noodles are homemade...you can taste the difference.  Their dumplings are made perfect, the crust/ or dough isn't thick, so you're not just eating dough.  Also the dumplings were not oily, which is a PLUS! definitely coming back here for Dumplings...great Dumpling Dive!"}
{"text":"Food was good. We had lots of different steamed and fried dumplings. They all were delicious. Fried bamboo fish was excellent. Spring onion cake was amazing. Sweet corn soup was ok. Service was ok. Cleanest of the restaurant was ok. Prices are average ."}
{"text":"Went there for a dinner Sunday evening . Small place but not too busy.  Dumplings are made fresh inside the restaurant. The fried onion pancake was dry. Dumplings were good and fresh.  The eggplant with vegetables in garlic sauce was very delicious.  Food came very fast. The service was ok. Not the cleanest place."}
{"text":"Coming here a very long time ago it was a great delight to see it still standing. I originally was very excited to come here to eat again. Although decor seemed a little more lively and tables semi shiny. It wasn't all that it used to be.

We ordered two sets of dumpling one pork and leek and lamb and then the roll dumpling fried along with beef tendon fried and pork belly with garlic. The tendon was well cooked and very tasty. The pork belly was semi ok it felt like something was missing. The dumplings were semi tasty along with the fried rolled dumpling. It wasn't as good as it used to be when I came here nearly fifteen years ago and it's only because of one reason which was there was way too much msg in the food making it too hard to eat without drinking mass amounts of water and tea. 

Would I come here again, most likely not anymore due to the fact that it's not as special as it used to be as there are a lot more new dumpling houses everywhere. Less msg maybe I would come back but time to try new places now."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Was really excited after reading all the positive reviews but I found this place to be highly overrated. Dumplings are average but service is horrible. It took them over 20minutes to serve just two bowls of dumplings and only after I finished and went to pay did I found out that they accept ONLY CASH. No signs and no mention until the last minute."}
{"text":"The chilled steamed rice noodles (??) were, unfortunately, not fully cooked this time and we had to return it. We were grateful they allowed us to replace the order with something else. The dumplings, scallion pancake, and sour/spicy soup are to die for."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years.  In fact, it's the default place that I visit for my dumpling cravings in Markham. 

Arriving at your table hot, and made fresh to order - the dumplings are delicious and consistent. The texture of the dumpling themselves, just right. Not chewy or overly thin.  I only wished they also made xiao long bao. There are quite a variety of dumplings, featuring pork, leeks, chicken, chive or a combination of those ingredients and more.  You are bound to find a dumpling that you will like.  You can have your dumplings steamed or pan fried, it's up to you. 

Another favourite of mine that they offer is the  cumin lamb, and the jellyfish salad with diced cucumber over a bed of soy sauce and sesame seed oil.  The lamb is absolutely wonderful, a fine balance between the spices that do not overpower the senses yet fragrant upon being served. A must have for all lamb lovers!

They only accept cash and there can be a bit of a wait on busier nights.  Well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. Few tables seated but certainly not crowded. Probably more people around/after 7pm.  I think value is pretty good. Ex: If I was by myself, I can order a hot pot with noddle, shrimp and few other items for $10. Would be more than enough.  Didn't get a chance to take pictures or note what we ordered, but all items was pretty good. We did not order any traditional dumplings this time though.  Wanted to try other items. To be honest, for anything related/similar to traditional dumplings, I'd prefer homemade everytime. Would certainly go back."}
{"text":"General Tao chicken= 
excellent. 
A single order feeds 2. If your eating this all alone, probably not going to feel great later! Heavy meal. But the best general Tao I've eaten."}
{"text":"We come here once a while. It gets pretty busy during rush hours. 

Services is a 2.5-3*
Food is a 4*

I gave four stars because it doesnt bother me with their poor services. Thats how most Chinese restaurants are. Lol"}
{"text":"One of my favourite dumpling restaurants in Toronto! 

Where do u get 15 fresh dumplings for $5? I also love their red bean paste puffs that are covered in sugar... SOOOOOooo good! They have some very unique dishes worth checking out too, like the glass noodle appetizer... or their green onion pancakes... hot sour soup...*drool*

The portions of this restaurant are meant to be shared. It's worth every penny.

If you ever come during peak hours, be sure to come well ahead of time or try making reservations. There is usually a 4 out of 5 times I've been here I've had to line up."}

{"text":"This is my third visit to this place. I was not satisfied with the first two times. As the name of the restaurant, the dumplings should be the signature dishes at this place. However, the ones I had in the last two times weren't impressive at all. The skin of the dumplings was way to thick and dry, and the amount of the stuffing inside was very limited. Due to the multiple requests of my partner, we decided to try it out again to see if there is any improvement made.

We had an appetizer, a dish of vegetables, and an order of seafood dumplings. The taste of the appetizer was a bit plain so we asked the server to add more spice to enhance the flavour. Overall, it tastes pretty refreshing in the summertime because of the mix of the cucumber and parsley. The dish of assorted vegetables was very favourable. The potato and eggplants were well cooked, so soft and easy to chew. The sauce was well permeated through each slice of vegetables. Last but not the least, the dumplings were better. The stuffing was made by shrimps. It at last tastes fresh. The skin was still thick but was more softener than before. 

In the past, I would've given a 1-star, but this time, I gave them an average rating."}
{"text":"I've visited this place twice so far and its a bit of a hit or miss. The good dishes are good and the bad ones are really bad.

The first time I went I ordered steamed dumplings, sliced pork hock, and stir fried lamb. The stir fry and pork hock was beyond my expectations, both tasted great and portions are big. The steamed dumplings however was dissapointing, they it did taste fresh but it wasn't anything special. I could probably buy better dumplings from the frozen section at a chinese super market.

The second time I went, I ordered pan fried pomfret, braised beef noodles, beef pancake and pan fried dumplings. The dumplings was decent, better than the steamed ones I would say. The braised beed noodles tasted very odd. The first thing I noticed when it came to our table was strange red color the beef was in. The soup also smelled a lot like dish water. The pan fried pomfret scarred me. The fish was of such poor quality. Now I know you can only get pomfret frozen here in Canada, or at least I've only had frozen ones here. But it tasted so unfresh, it was as if it was left dead in room temperature for a day before they froze it. The sweet and sour sauce did not help the taste at all, if anything it made it more prominent.
The beef pancake was great however. The beef was good, the pancake was a bit bland on its own but with the beef and sauce it tasted just right.

I would still go back tho, but I recommend ordering from the special's menu on the table. Those dished seems great so far."}
{"text":"Slow service so order in advance to pick up or expect long waits for your dumplings.. however the steamed dumplings are really yummy.  I also ordered the jellyfish ap but it wasn't very flavourful."}
{"text":"I normally don't eat chineese food, but those dumplings were good! That's the only reason to come back. Other dishes were not as good, unfortunately, and as its with other Chinese restaurants, it was hard to get our waiter to notice us. 
We paid less than 10 bucks each for a huge portion of dumplings that we didn't even finish."}
{"text":"Craving for dumplings for a few days, I decided to come to this restaurant for lunch. We ordered lamb dumplings, pan fried pork and chives dumplings and marinated beef. Beef is alright, not bad but nothing special. Dumplings are pretty good, as this place named dumpling house. Add some vinegar and hot sauce, the dumplings will taste even better. So we ended up ordering 2 lamb dumplings because they were really delicious. I think they make the dumplings fresh when you order."}
{"text":"This place I would say it's my favorite to come for dumplings and food!

Very small place that doesn't fit a lot of people inside the restaurant but even if they have a full house, don't worry, the waiting time isn't too long because food comes fairly quick and people eat and go.

The servers mostly speak Mandarin, but understands Cantonese and English. That isn't an issue at all because you don't really need to communicate with them. (sounds a bit weird)

They give you a menu full of pictures and a sheet of paper that reflects the items on the menu and you just mark the quantity that you would like to order beside that item. The sheet of paper has all the prices listed also, so you don't have to flip back and forth between the menu. If you know what the dish is, you don't even need the menu to help you. They also have pictures with English and Chinese along with prices posted up all along the walls. 

The quantity of food you're paying for are actually worth it, for 12 dumplings it's only around $4.99. We ordered the pork and leek dumplings and it was amazing. The freshly steamed dumplings, dipped in some vinegar, hits all your taste buds in your mouth. As you bite into it, the juices from the meat explodes into your mouth like a flavourful meat soup. Be careful when you try to take them apart from each other in the steam basket because the skin is thin which eliminates the doughy thick texture, thus if it pops, all the juices from inside will leak out!!

We also ordered a spicy lamb hot pot for only $9.99. They actually serve the dish on a gas stove, in a pot that allows you to control the temperature of the dish while you are eating it. If you would like to continuous keep it boiling so the spiciness never leaves or heating it up then letting it cool a bit to eat slowly, all decisions in your hands. The amount of veggies that are in the pot are unbelievable, it seemed they dumped a bunch of veggies in it until it didn't fit, then topped it off with a tons of thinly shaved lamb meat!  For $10, you can't ask for anything more!!

If I'm ever in the area, this place is always a choice on my list except maybe the weekends where the wait is a bit longer than usual. But other than that reasoning, there's no reason why I wouldn't go back again!"}
{"text":"One of my go-to spots for dumplings in Markham. They have very limited seating, and they're usually pretty busy, so on the weekends and at lunch time during the weekdays, be prepared to wait awhile. They have a variety of appetizers and dumplings (steamed or fried), noodle and rice dishes as well. 

I love their Hot & Sour Soup, as the hot and sour ratio is just perfect. I love the fact that it has tons of ingredients in it like crunchy bamboo shoots, sliced bean curd, as well as Chinese mushrooms. It went well with their Green Onion Pancake which almost every table had an order of. One of my favorites dishes here is the Fried Chive and Egg Pancake, which is loaded with vermicelli, Chive and egg and is super crispy on the outside. 

The Pan Fried Dumplings were okay, I would've like them more if the bottom had more of a crunch. The Steamed Pork and Cabbage Dumplings were good, not great, as there wasn't any soup inside and the filling was kind of dry, but then again this isn't Xiao Long Bao, which unfortunately they do not have! This place is definitely worth the try."}
{"text":"Good fried dumplings, I think it's great that you can actually see them hand making yours in the front of the restaurant and even people passing by can see it through the window.  Good service."}
{"text":"I can tell you now that one of my favourite foods is dumplings. Everything should be in a dumpling form.  I had to go to this restaurant, how could into wrong?

I took the liberty to order a giant amount of food.  Leek and pork dumplings, lamb dumplings hot and sour soup and more.  

First off, beware of giant portions.  You could probably get by with 2 dumpling orders and an app for two people.  We had a lot left over.

The soup was actually quite interesting.  The best way I can describe it is that they have their \"house\" version of a lot of stuff here.  For example, the hot and sour soup had tomatoes in it.  I guess it isn't really supposed to be in the soup, but I found that it made the \"sour\" or vinegar taste a little bit less artificial.  Good choice in my opinion.  Just... different.

The chive pancakes... OMG... ARE AMAZING!  By far, the best chive pancakes I've ever had.  Must Must Must get them here.  The reason they're so good is that they roll them out in a tube, and then fry it out into a pancake.  This keeps the middle of the \"pancake\" moist and soft.  In my experience, all the other places just flatten it out and fry it, making it really flaky and crispy.

The leek and pork dumplings were amazing.  Each one coming with mouth bursting goodness.  The cool thing is that they have a dumpling maker right beside the cash making fresh dumplings all day long.  It's neat how they emphasize the making of the dumplings.  I think it really adds to the experience.  The lamb dumplings were not so good.  I think they were a bit on the plain side.  My uncle's mother, (I have no idea how that's related) always said that you need 3 things in dumpings.  Leeks, meat and ginger.  Well... it had two out of the three; lamb and ginger.  

One thing we ordered was the pickled cabbage and spare rib stew.  Personally I hate the dish, so I can't really comment on how good or not good it was.

We also ordered the fried cabbage which was actually really good.  My parents actually said it reminded them of street vendors in china.  I've personally never been but I thought it was pretty good.

I'd say the best thing at this place is the chive dumplings.  If anything, go there for chive dumplings.  And maybe dumplings.  And maybe hot and sour soup.  Yes do that.  And tell me when you're going cause I'll come too."}
{"text":"Cheap prices (less than $20 to fill two people) and great portions; enough to fill you up (maybe and some), but not to make you want to knock out right there at your table after finishing your meal. Ordered the hot and sour soup, steamed pork and cabbage dumpling and pan fried pork dumpling. Hot and sour soup was soo good- perfect on a chilly day and a perfect flavour balance with the dumplings. The cabbage added such a nice texture to the meat of the steamed dumpling, definitely a must try. Beware of the delicious juice inside when picking it out of the basket or biting into it- eat it in one shot if you don't want any to go to waste. Pan fried dumplings were cooked just right. If you're in the area and craving, CDH is a must try at least once."}
{"text":"The dishes are all mediocre, not worth the price IMO. Service wasn't that good either. The dumplings, however, are great."}
{"text":"My hungry partner and I tried this place on a whim, drawn in by the delicious-looking menus outside...and WOW am I glad we went in!! Ordered 3 types of dumplings and a green onion pancake. We were the first diners of the day at around 11:15am, and we knew we were in for something special when the lady who took out order went to a metal counter at the front window and immediately started preparing our food: dumpling wrappers made fresh from scratch, cut from the dough and rolled out while we watched. She worked quickly and with obvious skill, and in a short time our orders arrived.

We had steamed veggie, egg and dried shrimp dumplings (15 per order), and two kinds of pan fried dumplings (12 per order): spinach and black mushroom, and fresh shrimp with veggie. The wrappers were outstanding: tender and not too thick. The pan fried dumplings were crispy on the bottom with lacy fried flour connecting them, and the steamed dumplings were juicy and well sealed to keep in the flavour. All three were delicious, but my fav was definitely the steamed egg/dried shrimp. The spinach filling was so fresh, and the whole fresh shrimp in the shrimp/veggie pan fried was juicy and perfect. Despite having three dumplings in variation of shrimp/veggie, all three each had its own unique flavour and were well-seasoned. I would order them ALL again for sure; however, the green onion pancake, while crisp, fresh and hot, was just ok next to the deliciousness of the dumplings - next time I will skip it and go straight to dumpling goodness!

Overall: outstanding in both flavour and value. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place had nice seating and the pan fried dumplings were great! However the service left much to be desired. They also forgot one of our orders after several reminders. Despite that, I would likely return for some pan fried dumplings to snack on."}
{"text":"This place is always packed and if you want takeout, definitely pre-order. They prepare their dumplings fresh, you can even see the ladies preparing them at the front. 
Service is very quick and food is delicious. They have a wide variety of dumplings and they are inexpensive as well."}
{"text":"It's all about the pan fried dumplings! We had the pork and shrimp one and the lamb pan fried dumplings and it was crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside! Everything you want in a pan fried dumpling!"}
{"text":"Overall I thunk the food is good. I came here on sunday night, pretty dead night for any business. However, this place still gets decent amount of customers. Dumpling is true north chinese taste. Good food and cheap, it's hard to find a plaxe like this in this area. But, only thing I don't like is the dishes they put on every table are not that clean. My sauce dish was little bit sticky =\. Overall, 3.5/5. I really like clean dishes. I hope i will have better experience next time."}
{"text":"I have been here about 7 times, overall the price and food are decent. My reason for 3 stars is because the service and cleanliness have forgotten worst. The lady making the dumplings kept coughing without covering her mouth into the ingredients while checking her phone!!! Took more than 30 minutes on a quiet evening for my take out because they forgot an item. Did not apologize or admit their mistake."}
{"text":"Food: The dumplings were average, noodles was ok. There was a strand of hair in the onion pancake. The cup of soy milk was so small. 

Environment: dirty and sticky chairs and sour smell

Service: bad. No greeting no thank you no nothing"}
{"text":"Get green onion pancake, chives pancake, pan fried dumplings, pork wonton. There's also a fish dish which was the highlight of the meal, similar to sweet and sour flavour, the fish was lightly battered and tossed in a slight tangy sauce... soo delicious. You could the fish is not the frozen kind.
Skip the dan dan noodle. My friend ordered it and said it wasn't the greatest"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst Chinese restaurants I've ever been to. Food was pretty terrible, the service was awful and the bathrooms were absolutely disgusting. I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like and how much care they take in food preparation."}
{"text":"Back here after a while...Dropped by during the busy lunch hour rush...
Space is a bit restricted inside with just about enough space between tables for adults to walk through...Got seated right away...
Beware if you're going in during the rush hours, seating might be a tad bit of an issue with couples and/or 2 people taking up a table of 4 to store their jackets, huge female purses, etc...

We got the Steamed Lamb Dumplings for $7.99, Stewed Sheep in Hot Pot for $9.99, and the Lunch Special - Spicy Beef with Steamed Rice for $6.99...

Since we were starving and during the rush hour, the 10min wait for the dumplings seemed like forever...

The Dumplings have 15 pieces in an order, which we devoured in just 5mins, I loved them, my girlfriend okay them...The couple seating next to us gave us a weird look...Lol

The Hot Pot & the Beef with Rice arrived together as soon we emptied the box of dumplings...

The Hot Pot had a tad too much Red Chilies, Oil & Spice for me, but my girlfriend loved it...!!!

The Spicy Fried Beef with Rice didn't feel like a Lunch Special...The quantity was way too little for it to be priced at $6.99, it'd have been fine if it was a mall food-court restaurant, but not here...

Overall, we loved it here, and we'll back...!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to eat. Pork and leek dumplings are the best! The fact that they are hand made gives it that homemade type of feel. They're Asian- service is fast but they're rude. \"You want the dumpling? Okay bye\" I also get the beef noodle soup, which you can feel the MSG run through your veins. 


It's a 3 star+1 more for nostalgia."}
{"text":"Have been looking for another good dumpling place outside of chinatown and I think I've found it. Ordered the pan fried dumplings, boiled dumplings, and shanghai stir fried noodles. They were all very good. Just the right size for the meat and dumpling skin.

Would definitely be back. Prices are also average (i.e. not high)."}
{"text":"Food was great, very flavourful. Will order again. Had dumplings, noodles and a chicken and Kale dish."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Not sure how it compares to the Chinatown location but omg, the dumplings were so damn good. The meat filling was very good, like the filling was meaty and also soupy which keeps the meat filling moist, you don't want dumpling filling that's dry (big no no). The dumpling skin itself is relatively thin but not too thin and not too thick where you feel like you're just eating dumpling skin. We also got a plate of General Tao's Chicken, that was also extremely good. Their version was made with jalapeno peppers...I was deceived and thought it was regular green bell pepper but whatever it was delicious! Definitely will come back for more dumplings ^^"}
{"text":"A friend of mine chose this restaurant for a simple late dinner. It's a small, unassuming place in a plaza full of restaurants. They have a very large selection of Northern Chinese cuisine. The menu has pages of pictures and descriptions of each dish. Orders are place by filling in quantities on a separate sheet of paper that also has descriptions but no pictures.

Three of us ordered six dishes. Big mistake. The portions were very generous and we took home half of it. The prices are very reasonable and the service was very good. We didn't realize how late it was and we were encouraged to order while waiting for our friend because the kitchen was closing in five minutes. Despite this, we were not refused service and never felt rushed during our meal. We ended up being the last diners in the restaurant.

Our dishes included steamed lamb dumplings, braised ribs noodle soup, beef shank with pan fried pancakes, twice cooked pork with vegetables, fried egg with bitter melon, and green onion pancakes. Hmmm, it didn't seem like that much when we ordered it.

All the food was very tasty, even better than we expected. The pancakes had a nice crispy texture. The lamb dumplings came with 15 in the order and they were very good. I will most definitely order that again, along with the pork and beef shank dishes."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for dumplings. 15 freshly made dumplings right in front of the place for 4.99 is a deal. The place is small and you would often find a line up at peak hours. We were seated sharing another table. We were starving so we didn't really care but it can get uncomfortable specially when you have to share the side sauces.  Ordered pork and leek dumplings with the green onion pancake, garlic vegetables and pork bone stew. Gotta have the pancake along with you dumplings. Dumplings were nice and juicy. You have to be careful though as they do come out streaming. Have burned my mouth a couple of times before. The dumplings and pancake were on point as always. The veggies were good too but the pork bone was not much to be desired. It was a little tough and taste was too rich and fatty."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to this restaurant for lunch today.  We ordered three dishes for the two of us: jellyfish & cucumber salad; green onion pancake, and 15 steamed pork dumplings.

The jellyfish & cucumber salad was absolutely delicious for a cold appetizer.  Their green onion pancake seemed to be missing a bit of flavour to it, but if you add a tinge of soya sauce, it was good.  The pork dumplings was amazing!  Lots of juices in them.  

All together, it cost about $15 - which is quite worth it!  I was really full in the end.

However, the only difficulty is that the servers are not very fluent in English, so that was just one difficulty.  However, great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"After heading to the Chinese Dumpling House at Metro Square, I decided to try the other location out, because I heard the place is much better.

The decor was much nicer than the other one, and much larger as well.  However, the air conditioning seemed to be turned on like crazy there.  I was not impressed.

Anyhow, my parents and I decided to order the following: jellyfish, bokchoy + pork dumplings (15), and this dish of noodles (I forgot what they were called in English).  The jellyfish dish was much less than the one in Metro Square, the dumplings weren't as good (however, I think I liked the leek kind better), and the noodles were really oily.

I would recommend the Chinese Dumpling House at Metro Square a lot more!"}
{"text":"As an American, I'm always looking for American style Chinese food in Toronto and this is the best place I've found in my years of looking. Love the beef with broccoli and beef in black bean sauce. They give a pretty big portion for the price, too. And the servers are nice. I also appreciate that it's usually pretty empty so it's not awkward to eat lunch here alone lol."}
{"text":"The lineups at this sausa location speaks volume for the food. Its solid northern style chinese food. Surprisingly the service was very good when I went. The guy who served me was really good! Spoke good english and was fast and efficient. Food took awhile to come but it all came out at the same time.

The lamb with cumin dish is to die for. LOVE LAMB. The dumplings (pork and leeks) came in 15s and were soft pockets of goodness. They are so easy to eat. Trust me, 15 is nothing for two people. The bean sprout veggie dish was also on point. 

Price is decent too. All the qualities you could ask for. Just one knock is the lineups and not having that many tables for being a smaller resto. Cant hold that against them though. 5 stars *****"}
{"text":"So I first saw the sign for this place (interestingly enough, in Koreatown) and was grateful that it's not yet another Japanese restaurant in this area. 

Then I saw an eager girl giving out take-out menus that advertised Opening Special 20% off. I walked past this location and saw a young girl making Chinese dumplings in the front window. 

I figured I'd give it a shot. I've been there 4 times now since they opened in the past month. The first time, I was greeted by a sweaty, frazzled waitress (there were only 4 occupied tables), one girl was making dumplings in the window, one cook was in the kitchen, a woman was coming upstairs (from where other rooms, prep, probably) and the bathrooms are situated) with bowls of rice. Every time I'm here, there's a frantic server yelling downstairs to someone to bring something up. I'd really like it if there were napkin dispensers on the tables. I'm a messy eater and get tired of asking for more each time. 

The bathroom is located down a long set of stairs, round a corner, past a prep room..the bathroom is sorely in need of an update/upgrade. The stall on the left (when you come in) doesn't close properly, it flew open twice after I had tried securing it both times,  there is no garbage bin for paper towels outside of the two stalls - the paint is a horrible, leftover, 90s peach. It makes me question the cleanliness of the kitchen when I see a bathroom in this kind of condition.

So back upstairs, my pan fried (get these if you want crispy!) shrimp dumplings arrived. They arrive in one connected circle (12 dumplings for pan fried) and you break the crispy dough to eat each dumpling separately. Hot and tasty! I always convince myself that I'll only eat half and get the rest to go. Hasn't happened yet. 

Second visit I ordered the pan fried seafood dumplings, they were good. As well the pork and chive. Also, every table was full and there was only ONE waitress for the entire restaurant. I waitressed for years and that's not cool. Staff get overworked and frazzled and customers get frustrated and don't come back. 

Yesterday's order of pork and chive were a bit more greasy than other times, but that's my only complaint about the food. Maybe next time I'll try the steamed dumplings. But only half an order.
: 0 )"}
{"text":"Food only, 3 stars.  Overall value, 3.5 stars.

We visited for lunch today.  We shared an order of pork and leek dumpling ($6 for 15 - as of Sept 2014), a soup noodle ($5) and a bean pancake dessert ($3).  Everything tasted decent.  Nothing was particularly bad.  If I must be picky, it would be that the dumplings had no soup inside.  The services was friendly and quick.  The pricing was exceptionally good.  The seating was simple  

Chinese Dumpling Houes reminds me of a neighbourhood restaurant that courts its customers by food, value and friendliness instead of nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Okay, I love this place. Actually, ever since I came to eat here, I've been dreaming about coming back.. so good. I came here with two friends and we ordered a bunch of dishes to share. We started with hot & sour soup.. it comes in two sizes, regular and large. I thought the regular would be a single-person serving so that's why I ordered it. It actually is a huge bowl of soup, so I can't imagine how big the large is! We ended up having enough to split between three people, two servings each. The hot & sour here is also really good, broth has nice tartness and is not too spicy (my friend that doesn't like spicy food was able to eat it and enjoy it) and has all the standard ingredients plus tomato slices, which I thought was interesting.

Next, we ordered the sweet & sour crispy pork and the pan fried green onion cake. The sweet & sour crispy pork is SO GOOD. Just order it, okay? The onion cake is nice too, but pretty plain. It doesn't need to be more complex though; tasty just the way it is!

We then got four different kinds of dumpling, since that's what we came here for: steamed pork and leek, steamed pork and fennel, steamed vegetable and mushroom, and pan fried pork and chive. They were all amazing. My favourites were the fennel and veggie dumplings. The pan fried ones were great but I could have done without them because they tasted so heavy and oily after eating the steamed ones. We couldn't even finish everything, so I took the leftovers home with me and had them for lunch at work the next day and they were still amazing!

Can't wait to come back here, seriously.. yum."}
{"text":"They've got great dumpling for its price. Maybe not suitable for people who absolutely cannot stand greasy food, but just a heads up, the filling and juicy is quite oily.

Overall, the taste is authentic Chinese dumpling (which includes the greasiness).

Recommend to dip a lot of vinegar to neutralize the greasiness though."}
{"text":"Dumplings:
First and foremost - This place is called Chinese Dumpling House - so the best thing on their menu are their dumplings - dumplings are a must order if you come here! 

Right when you walk in, there are ladies rolling dumpling wrappers by hand and filling the wrappers as orders come in. There's a consistant flow of bamboo steamers coming out of the kitchen. This is as fresh as you get! 

The menu boasts the standard variety of fillings: pork, shrimp, lamb with different kinds of veggies ranging from $6.99 - $4.99 for the steamed dumplings (15 pieces). There are pan-fried and soup ones as well, with the same price range. 

The dumplings itself are spot on, nice thin wrapper - a little chewy, and holds all the delicious and juicy filling. Also, a good test to a good dumpling is that the wrapper doesn't break when you pick it up. These are solid dumplings!

Other menu Items:
- includes noodles (soup and fried - soup noodles are decent sized bowl - ideal for sharing for 2 or 3 people), rice, chinese veggies, chicken, beef and pork dishes. They also have cold appetizers like cucumber garlic, thousand year old egg and tofu and others. Pan fried breads, pancakes, etc.  

Decor / ambiance. 
It's not very well laid out - space is tight!
there can be a bit of a wait sometimes, but turnover is pretty quick though. 
Not a lot of room for large gatherings 
wait staff are quick - and efficient - not the friendliest - but not rude 

Misc:
Parking is the metro square parking lot - always space there. 
Menu is a piece of paper w/ english and chinese and prices all laid out - so you mark off what you want- easy peasy! Wait staff circle your order paper in front of you  just make sure they don't overlook anything. 

Want good dumplings? Go here."}
{"text":"Food: good value for price. Lots of variety. Dumplings are freshly made to order, but ultimately nothing special IMO. Steamed and fried varieties available (I only tried the steamed). Personally I am also not really a fan of the Chinese-style dumpling wrap, which tends to be a bit on the thicker side. Green onion pancakes are unique and quite good. I also like the shredded potato (appetizer).

Service: spotty at best, but it gets the job done. Could be a challenge for non-Chinese speakers (they did have both Cantonese and Mandarin-speaking servers when I was there). You just order everything by ticking off a paper menu anyways, so server interaction is minimal.

Space: very limited, tight seating. Come during a busy night (e.g. weekends) and you'll most likely have to wait 30 minutes for a table."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the diner-esque vibe this no-frills Chinese joint gives off, especially because their food is darn delicious!

We ordered for two and ATE a lot! The portion sizes are very generous! Here's what we ordered:

Braised Pomfret- Going back for this one! Perfectly cooked, tender, meaty, flaky fish bathed in a spicy -sweet sauce

Lamb Dumplings- YES PLEASE! I couldn't stop popping these juicy, tasty morsels in my mouth!

Green Onion Pancake- Light, fluffy, stretchy dough... We said, we should save some... yeah right!

Sichuan Pepper Spinach- Packed with flavour and a great accompaniment to the fish, plus it made me feel healthy with ALL the food I was eating I would definitely order it again.

Wonton Noodle Soup- This was good, super authentic, but not a personal fave.

 I'm ready for some more dumplings and Pomfret... but I think I'll let myself digest!"}
{"text":"We think that this location in Mississauga was much better in terms of the quality of food and customer service. We ordered the lamb dumplings, spicy lamb with cumin and seafood fried rice. The dumplings were reasonably stuffed with meat and just the right amount of seasonings that highlighted the flavor of the meat. There was also a little soup inside each dumpling. My favorite was the spicy lamb with cumin. It was really nicely prepared.. The meat was tender and spiced to my preference. And off course, the rice, that completed my meal:) The servers were attentive. They seemed professional as they were not talking loudly amongst themselves while people were dining.
We would go back next time. We had a happy meal."}
{"text":"$5 for 15 dumplings? You really can't go wrong here!

Whenever I'm craving dumplings, I always come here!! The green onion pancake is delicious here but only if you like the crispy kind! My boyfriend is more partial towards the flat, chewy green onion pancake so he was not a fan.

Note: Their lamb dumplings are wonderful!

Will be back for more :)"}
{"text":"I've often passed the Chinese Dumpling House on my way to other restaurants in this plaza; yesterday was my first visit, for an early lunch (a plus, right off the bat, is that they open at 11.00).  It's very unassuming in terms of decor, and no ambiance to speak of, but the three dishes we sampled all were excellent: pan fried pork dumplings, steamed pork/shrimp/chive, and a red bean pancake.  The wrappers on the first set of dumplings were very delicate, with nice crispy edges -- the filling was beautiful with a hint of coriander in the pork.  The steamed ones (15 to an order) were splendid too, with a great coarse blend that contained plenty of shrimp pieces.  The sweet pancake (fried) made for a great finish to a small meal.  There are many many other dumplings on the menu, and the restaurant does serve other dishes as well.   My only complaint, and it's a small one, is that the chili sauce on the table isn't oil based and was a tad salty.  Certainly a place to return to!"}
{"text":"I am a regular here for lunch with my colleagues.  Apparently my colleague's family knows the owner, and mentioned that he used to have a restaurant in China and was famous for his dumplings. 

Located in a sea of bubble tea stores at Commerce Gate, you can find the restaurant close to Donburi. There is a large picture menu posted on the outside, and the photos depict delicious dishes at affordable prices.  The restaurant is mid-size, but can get busy during peak lunch hour. We've never had to wait because we usually arrive after 1 pm, although the restaurant is usually more than 50% packed.

Today, between the two of us we ordered their sweet and sour fried fish lunch combo, regular hot and sour soup, and an order of chive, egg, shrimp, and pork dumplings.  This was more than enough food and we still had leftovers.  The dumplings were simple and good. The filling and dumpling wrap ratio was superb.  The hot and sour soup was spicy.  I can't handle a lot of spicy, so I started sniffling. The lunch combo alone could have easily filled one person, the portion was a good size for the price ($6.99). 

Other dishes I've enjoyed in the past here are: sliced beef with beef pancake, pan-fried dumplings and the beef brisket noodle."}
{"text":"Love their dumplings and very reasonably priced. Can't beat dumplings for just $5. Most of their dishes are fairly good. But when we come here we always order the steamed and pan fried dumplings and hot and sour soup (with or without the noodle). It's a small restaurant so on weekends it can get filled up very quickly and don't expect to come with a large group. They only have a few tables that can accommodate 5+ people. Cash only. Will I come back again? Definitely!"}
{"text":"bf and i always love coming here! theyre always packed but the wait is never crazy.

nothing fancy in regards to the look of the restaurant but everything is delicious and homemade.

hot and sour soup, yum check
tomato lamb hot pot, yum check
soup filled dumplings, yum check
pan fried dumplings, yum check

we havent gotten a bad dish and doubt we ever will! theyre quick, delicious and fairly priced! i like that theyre open late too :)"}
{"text":"My go to dumpling house. Love the dumplings here, the green onion pancake, jellyfish appetizer, hot and soup soup is full of ingredients they don't skimp out!  Pea sprout dish is refreshing and tried the sweet and sour fish for the first time and it is a must try! The fish is lightly battered and still crispy even with sauce on top!  Will return regularly!"}
{"text":"Came here with my Po Po (Canto for Grandma) for Northern Chinese for lunch today. Asked the server for the specialties and she said all of the steamed dumplings (there's a woman on show in the front making it for passerbys to see) and the green onion pancake. Not feeling too hungry for a whole pancake, we got the Cabbage and Pork Dumplings ($5), the Shrimp, Leek and Pork Dumplings ($6), and the fried '9th vegetable' dumpling ($4). The steamed dumplings were great value (15 per batch), and fresh out of the steamer. The fried dumpling (see photo) had veg and eggs, and was also freshly friend and thus crunchily delicious. As others have mentioned, it's cozy, basically a typical Chinese 'fast food' restaurant. 

As others also have mentioned, the order sheet is in Chinese (didn't ask for an English one as I had my Po Po) but the menu is in English and has some pictures. All in all, simple steamed and fried dumplings at a way better value than some other places *cough the overpriced Asian Legend*"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for northern Chinese-style dumplings. It is well-priced and we always end for with more than we can actually finish

We usually always order - one order of their onion coil, their stir-fried snow pea shoots with garlic, and one of the potsticker dumplings. 

Service is more or less hit or miss and advanced English speaking skills are hard to come by as well. Should mention if you grab one of the younger looking guys - they do understand english. - otherwise pointing and miming what you need will get the job done."}
{"text":"This tiny dumpling house is amazing! The prices are quite cheap and the portions are large which makes this place even more awesome. I haven't tried some of the other dishes since it's called dumpling house so obviously you got to get the dumplings! Although I've tried other foods there and it's quite good. 

The service is very friendly I don't think I've ever had bad service. Rest assured if you can't speak mandarin or Cantonese the menu is I'm English and you mark how many servings you want. There is also take out!

My main go to is probably the pan fried dumplings!! $6 for like 12 and I usually combo that with chicken and mushroom dumplings $5 for 15 which is amazeballs.

The place is small so depending when you go it can be super packed, which kind of suck sometimes. Recommend not to go around dinner time or weekends for lunch and dinner. Parking nearby is decent. The lot can be filled since there are other stores and another plaza beside. Also they only take cash and if you don't have any there's an atm inside the plaza otherwise you'll be washing dishes."}
{"text":"This place isn't necessarily the best dumplings, but still good. 

The spring onion pancake is the BEST THING on the menu. The crispy fried pork is DELICIOUS; lightly battered thin strips of pork in a sweet and sour sauce. The steamed dumpings are good, but not great as are the fried ones. The baby baby dow-miow with garlic is super good, and still taste like veggies even after it's been cooked! 

Service is fast and efficient, but they are cash only, so come prepared!"}
{"text":"If nothing else, this place is super cheap! 

Dumplings were pretty good. The fried ones are better (we got pork and veggie, but once it's friend you can't tell what is inside). Boiled ones were okay, we got pork and shrimp (shrimp pieces were bigger than usual). 

The egg drop soup is delicious and a great deal for how much you get. And the chive pancake is light and hot, but not the chewy kind I like...more just flakey. 

This is a great place for students and other (almost) student types."}
{"text":"Chineses dumpling house, Chineses not Chinese, is an authentic Chinese restaurant. We have the cabbage with vermicelli, shredder pork and shrimp with veggies. The food was a little greasy but tasted really good. 

I went with a friend who has spent many years in China and this was the first place he was able to find that had food that reminded him of the food he had in China. There are a lot of other Asian cuisines near by so if they are really busy you can try one of the other ones."}
{"text":"This is a great dumpling house that's good for young crowds or for family. Prices are super-slightly more expensive than regular dumplings restaurants.

Service is speedy. Table space is good. Decor is not the highlight here but rather the variety of awesome Asian cuisine.

My dish recommendation: Lamb Dumplings. Nice starter meal and comes in crowd-quantity."}
{"text":"It is good to have something new in Mississauga, so we will have more competitions.

We ordered 2 kinds of dumpling, steam and pan fried. Both of their dumplings were pretty good, and they were very juicy inside.

We also ordered spicy pig ear, but it turned out to be very tasteless and not spicy at all.

The spicy beef tendon was the best dish so far for the night. It was spicy, and very tasty. It just make my mouth watery even thinking of it again.

We also had some of their noodle soup and pork wonton, and I have to say its pretty good as well.

The bad part about this restaurant were:
1. Maybe they are new or maybe business is pretty good. We had to change 2 of the dishes because they told us they don't have it.
2. Half of our dishes we ordered were kind of tasteless, maybe they wanted to be on the healthy side but I had many China style food before and this restaurant was the tasteless one I found. We ordered around 10 dishes, and 4 of the dishes were pretty bland.
3. The tea that they gave us are \"watery\". You guys know how tea has this tanned color in them but their tea was like clear boiled water with few tea leafs inside. I looked inside the tea pot but there was no tea leafs inside. I assumed the tea came out from a central machine and they didn't change the old tea leafs to a new one and used that batch all day long. Also, the \"watery tea\" was warm and not hot.

Price was alright. I might go back but probably will just eat their dumplings...."}
{"text":"Had dumplings here a while ago when I visited Toronto a few years ago...they have very authentic Dongbei dumplings. Very affordable and the staff is great. If you wanna grab a bite with friends and family, I will recommend to eat here. Today I am back here again and order a takeout;)"}
{"text":"The food was ok, not too oily so that's a bonus. The veggies was over salted. Dumplings were juicy and dumpling dough was not too thick. so that was perfect. Price was decent.. service was so so."}
{"text":"This place is my go-to dumpling place in Richmond Hill. If you're looking for quick service and a wallet friendly meal, this is definitely a place to try! 

There are various steamed pork + vegetable dumplings, such as cabbage, zucchini, celery and watercress. If you don't like pork, you can always choose either lamb, beef and chicken but the vegetable is limited. I usually order the steam pork with cabbage dumplings. They are $6.50 for 15 dumplings now - very juicy meat and I love their thicker dumpling skin. 

I also enjoy their minced pork and soya paste noodles at $5.99. It comes with cucumbers to mix in. Their noodles here are extremely chewy, and the soya paste is not too salty!"}
{"text":"The dumplings are fresh and tasty, even better with a side of sriracha. You can watch them make the dumplings at the front window. The other Chinese food is good as well, and they have a pretty big selection of traditional and western Chinese food (ex general tao). Note that they only take debit or cash, as most Chinese places do."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem in Metro Square. At first, you would think this restaurant is sketch by looking at it's exterior sign BUT do not let that fool you! This place actually has really good food and the food is so cheap! Went with a group of 6 people and ordered more than 90 dumplings and a couple of other dishes and the bill was just at $60. That's unbelievable. Highly recommended. Probably the best place for dumplings/northern Chinese food in Markham. However, you should come either earlier or later as this place gets crowded at the door easily. Restaurant is not big either so waiting times can be long. 

This is another Asian establishment that only accepts cash so remember to bring cash!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was a bad day for the chef or it was in a shitty mood but I have to say their fried pork dumplings were terrible, wasn't pan cooked enough and the meat look like crap, I rather eat pan fried dumplings from the frozen ones at the supermarket

We were also dumb enough to order the Singapore fried rice noodle which was generous in portion but it was overly spicy and the toppings they used were shit...didn't even have shrimp in it, a lot of the noodles didn't seem to be mixed properly....

Stay far far away"}
{"text":"cheap prices and food, what do you expect, not a fancy place but good to get your tummy full of dumplings. I advise to not get any of the noodles,  didnt taste too good especially the dan dan noodles. Food is medicore
Pancakes and that fried dough stuff are pretty good though"}
{"text":"Very good Chinese dumplings and related foods. Small location.

Anything on menu is good. Glad they have photos of items. I like their dumplings and pancakes. Also good is hot n sour soup."}
{"text":"Good taste and good portion. Price is reasonable as well. However last week I went there, the plates they used to put the food on was soooo dirty. It was  super oily on the top and at the bottom. I don't even think they washed it."}
{"text":"Here's a little background before I begin - my dad's family was from Beijing and I lived in Beijing for a while. Having been spoiled by my grandma'a delicious home made dumplings, I can be pretty harsh in my criticisms. 
I only tried their dumplings (all of the flavours) and some of their cold dishes. I really like the pork belly with vinegar and soy sauce dish. It reminded me of food I had in childhood. A little bit too salty though.
As for the dumplings, I can only say it's standard. The flavours are nothing impressive, and can be a little bland at times (especially after a very salty appetizer). In Toronto standards, it's probably 4/5 or even better. It's just not that plump. Juice wasn't that abundant. And the dumpling sizes varied a bit in each tray. I guess that's what you get from hand made.
Anyways let's not be harsh with them. This is so far my fave dumpling place in Markham. Food is cheap and very filling. 
Some young girls working there got bad attitudes. But that's usually the case at cheap eats."}
{"text":"Pros:
Great dumpllings
Good value

Cons:
Seats are a little cramped

Chinese Dumpling house is a place I would totally recommend to any dumpling lover.  THey have a good amount of selection here and the value can't be beaten.

I love me some good dumpling and Chinese Dumpling house really delivers well when it comes to dumplings.  Walking in, you see the dumplings are freshly being made as the day goes.  This place is mad busy so the chances the dumplings you get served were made just recently are very high.

I love the value this place gives.  For $6.50 you get 15(!!!) dumplings.  That's probably the best value in town right now.  They've got a good assortment of dumplings to choose from.  There's also a ton of other Chinese dishes at pretty good prices.  Dinner for 4 here can be done for under $40 and you will be full after!  

The only thing I don't like about this place is the seating arrangement.  The place is on the small side and they cram as many tables and chairs into this place as possible.  Couple this with the fact that this place is crazy good and there's plenty of people here all the time, it's a bit chaotic at times.  You feel really crammed at times.  I have two little ones with me as well so that doesn't help at all either.

I would so recommend this place for people who want authentic Chinese dumplings.  You can't go wrong here.  I see lists of best dumplings in Toronto, it's a crime this place is not on those lists if you ask me."}
{"text":"I came here with my parents for an early dinner and it was surprisingly busy.

There was a variety to choose from the menu and we definitely had some issues narrowing down our dishes. In the end, we ordered a fish dish, dumplings, beef with noodles and chive pancakes.

I thought the fish dish was ok, my mom's complaint was that the fish separated too easily so it was hard to pick up. The beef with noodles tasted like it's from any other dumpling restaurant so I didn't have any complaints. The chive pancakes were on par with my favourite restaurant, New Northern Dumplings. However, it's the actual dumpling dish where I was slightly disappointed. I found the skin to be a bit thicker than my favourite restaurant. They're not made fresh to order (I saw them getting the dumplings out of the fridge) but it's probably because it can get really busy so it'll be difficult to handle the order volume.

Overall, I think I'm going to stick to my Scarborough restaurant with its slightly cheaper price."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a Thursday evening and the place is quite busy. By 7, it was completely filled but there wasn't any obvious lineups.
I was impressed by their variety of traditional dumplings (pork/chicken with choices all common types of veggie combinations like chives, bak choy etc) but would have loved some unique or creative specials.
I ordered pork potstickers, chicken and mushroom steamed dumplings and a beef noodle.
Both dumplings were quite delicious but I preferred the pork filling more. The potstickers had some soup inside and most were intact when you pull them apart. The chicken steamed dumplings came in a steamer like you would see soup filled dumplings. Some of the wrapper would dry up towards the last couple, but was still tasty.
The beef noodle I would suggest everyone to skip, the soup was like water and some bites every had a mild soapy taste. The beef and noodle was average and definitely cannot make up for the nasty soup.
The prices were good, the two of us only spent $21 on dinner before tip. The server gave me the wrong change but was apologetic once I pointed it out.
I would come again to try the other dumplings."}
{"text":"Several years later, this place is still going strong and continues to be popular for dumplings.

Chinese Dumpling House recently underwent renovations. It is clean and well-lit. You can still see the ladies making dumplings just a few meters away. As well, there seem to be more staff who speak Cantonese now.

Nice to see that their recipe for success continues to be consistent!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for a cheap dinner that isn't too heavy. Located in Commerce Gate, parking outside can be quite difficult to find during lunch and dinner hours any day of the week; park underground to save time (and so that your car doesn't smell like Korean bbq).

This restaurant offers a lot of staple northern Chinese dishes, including tons of steamed/pan fried dumpling varieties. The steamed dumplings are priced at about $6 for 15 and are freshly made, along with a mix of the vinegar and chili paste; its delicious!

Other dishes I regularly get is the deep fried green onion pancake, braised beef noodles in soup, and red bean pancake (sweet). The menu is in both Chinese and English and you mark everything yourself; there is also a menu book which has pictures of all the menu items!

My only complaint would be the cleanliness of this restaurant as I often have to wipe down the tables, bowls and chopsticks..but it's no big deal for the price you pay and the quick turnover of tables."}
{"text":"Decent food, great price, but disastrous service. I do not recommend dining in. 

Went here on a Tuesday evening with 3 friends for a late night dinner. We wanted two separate bills so we asked for a second sheet of paper to order our food and it took our server 10 minutes to get us another sheet and another menu. To top that off, she was extremely rude and basically threw our food on the table. There was two other tables in the restaurant, yet all the servers seemed to disappear. Another table had to walk up to the front desk and call to the kitchen for someone to give them their bill. 

Also, when my boyfriend went up to pay our bill, our server gave us wrong change back, and when he turned around to return to the table, she yelled at him for not tipping. She already took 10% and tipped herself and has the audacity to ask why we didn't tip. Girl you just took our money and tipped yourself. We usually leave the tip on the table before we leave. We didn't even notice she gave us the wrong change until this morning. 

FYI, tip is not mandatory. I've been a server for 5 years and I have NEVER asked a table why they didn't tip or why they tipped so little. Tip is an OPTION; it's a courtesy.. it also depends on your quality of service. You do not yell at your customers for not tipping, ESPECIALLY if the service was terrible. I understand servers depend on tips and all but if it takes 10 minutes for us to get a menu and us to walk up to the counter to find a server, you can't expect to receive a 20% tip."}
{"text":"Shanghai fried noodles shouldn't be sweet! I guess they have adjusted the traditional taste to suit the customer base but it left me unsatisfied :("}
{"text":"- not too much traffic, no need to reserve
- booths are terribly worn through with rips. They could at least patch it up with tape so it doesn't rip more and we aren't sitting on sponge
- servers were not attentive. We needed more tea and they didn't refill despite the restaurant being quite empty (around 7pm)
- one of our dishes did not come at all. 

My friend had been before and said the food was tasty so we let her order a few items she got last time including:
Cold Pork belly with ginger - thin slices topped with chopped garlic in a light soya sauce
Beef brisket noodles - noodles were quite fresh tasting and well cooked
Vegetables with mushroom - Choi with sliced white/brown mushrooms werent greasy or heavy but dressed in a flavourful sauce
Some spicy chicken + rice dish I believe from their lunch menu. This was my favourite dish. I didn't eat the dry chilies but the spice level was very good and the chicken was delicious. I also live when red Peppers and carrots are paired with stir fried chicken. Thick, glaze like sauce.
Pan fried pork and leek dumplings - large with a nice thick wrapper that leaves a bit of chew

Price is very good so I would come again but would choose to order and pickup the takeout instead!"}
{"text":"After hearing so many good things about this restaurant in Markham, I happened to drive by found out they opened a new location here. After a long day of sightseeing in Niagara Falls, I was so looking forward to this meal. I ordered the pickled cabbage and leek pork dumplings. All I have to say, disappointment. The restaurant should be Northeastern Chinese style where pickled cabbage is an essential dish for every family. The dish tasted nothing like home. Instead of natural sour, the taste came from vinegar. There was way too much garlic in the dish too. Leek dumplings had way too much pork and there was barely any leek taste. I truly hope the Markham one is better. :("}
{"text":"Excellent taste and excellent price! I have been here before and it was so good and so cheap I'm back for more. I choose not to cook, so make a habit of finding cool restaurants on yelp and once I validate them, stocking my fridge with tasty ethnic cuisine. Just ordered a bunch of dumplings - pork with cabbage, pork with celery, pork with fennel, pork with shrimp and minced beef. Some shanghai noodles and General Tao chicken."}
{"text":"I really like coming here. I'm a big fan of steamed dumplings and I love the generous portions for the meal that you get. The service isn't entirely the best buy I expect that for the kind of restaurant that it is and the price that you pay.

I love the fact that they have a wide variety of steamed dumplings to try. Each serving has 15 dumplings and range from $9-15. They could seek to improve on their fried dumpling selection. 

They also have delicious appetizers and mains. We tried the Singapore style noodles and it was spicy enough but not too spicy. My favourite was their fish skewer appetizer. The fish was gigantic and it was almost like a full meal! It was seasoned well and was something different to try that I had never seen before. 

Dumplings are standard but they are generous with the fillings and steamed perfectly - not too soggy or sticky. Mmm dumplings!"}
{"text":"Depends what you come here for. 

Green onion cake - 5 stars 

Clams and leek vegetable fish - 5 stars

beef brisket noodle soup - 2 stars no flavour noodles a bit chewy beef had no flavour 

fried fish - 2stars i had high hopes for this dish but it turned out way too chewy.. like almost beef jerky chewy!! reminded me of canned salted fish texture.. could only eat it by drowning sauce

Dumplings - 3 stars nothing special we got chicken and mushroom and the filling was pulverized rather than in pieces flavour was okay

Very small place."}
{"text":"I ordered the Pan-Fried Pork and Chive dumplings and the General Tao Chicken for take out. The food was ready in 10 minutes and I was greeted the minute I walked in the door. The best part was that even after my walk home the dumplings were still crispy and hadn't gotten soggy.

Overall the meal was delicious and a great option if you live in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"3-3.5*  

Cheap(ish), as cheerful as Chinese waitstaff can be, with decent food.  Again, not the best dumplings that I've ever had, but then again, how can you possible go wrong with dumplings??  I've never had terrible ones and dunno how you can screw that up!

I can also vouch that dumplings were handmade as opposed to picked up from the freezer section of T&T, down the road.

Portions were quite generous.  Steamed dumplings were cheaper than pan fried.  Pan fried are  $1/dumpling, but also larger.  You can easily feed 3 people for ~$20, no problem!  I would not be opposed to going back.

P.S.  What's up with the name...seriously??"}
{"text":"Came in here for lunch the other day with my sister. We decided to share 12 fried dumplings and got the variety plate. We ordered mixed vegetables, mixed vegetables and shrimp, and spinach and black mushroom. They were fried perfectly and were generously stuffed with ingredients. There are two reasons why they didn't get a perfect rating was: 
1. I am vegetarian and they did not tell us which dumplings had the shrimp in them, so we had to do process of elimination, hoping I wouldn't bite into a shrimp.
2. The washrooms were gross. 

Other then that they prices were very good and the dumplings were delicious. I will be back again."}
{"text":"We'll start with what's good.  The food.  You get 15 dumplings for $7.99 so that's an amazing deal in itself.  They're very juicy inside so I'd recommend them for sure.  I also got a hotpot dish with meat and some veggies.  It wasn't amazing and I wasn't the fan of the soup at all but the meat was tasty enough.  Outside of the food and prices, the restaurant itself is pretty clean.  I also went on a Sunday morning (on one of my multiple visits) and the wait was for 10 minutes, tops.  Just be warned that you're still better off going earlier if you're one of those people that don't like waiting, especially considering the place is pretty small and there's no real place to wait outside of at the door.  The parking's not awful either.  The lot is for a large plaza and a few other restaurants.  Overall, while you may be parking far-ish away, there is always a spot there.

What's not good?  The service can be pretty horrendous.  Multiple waitresses didn't know how to speak much English at all.  The start of it was that we ordered something that wasn't available, unknown to us, and the waitress had the hardest time communicating this to us.  After we told her that we didn't speak Mandarin, she kind of stared at the menu for a while, pointed, then said \"no\".  After half a minute of us going \"what?\", she finally said \"we no have\".  The second point was that they forgot to bring a few items that we ordered.  We ordered three orders of dumplings and they only brought two of them so we had to somehow communicate this and wait a while to get the third one.  Why they didn't come with the other two, I don't know.  They also forgot our two bowls of rice and water another time.. which I feel should be the easiest thing to get right.  The third problem is that they didn't really get the concept of splitting a bill... that took another several minutes to figure out.

If you're reading this, take cash!  This is the only form of payment they accept.  Not a huge fan of this.

The good: Food, price, wait time.
The weird: Payment options.
The awful:  Service, service, service.

I love what they do and the food is good but my second visit was such a needless struggle that it's hard to recommend this as a 'for sure' option to someone else."}
{"text":"Got the green onion pancake and whole bunch of dumplings. Would recommend the pancake, lamb dumplings and deep fried dumplings."}
{"text":"I came here for a casual lunch and was pleasantly surprised by everything... Everything except for the dumplings. I tried them steamed and pan fried, but I found the skin too soggy for my liking. The dumplings were actually pretty decent, but short of my expectations for a restaurant named after dumplings.

The dish you need in your life is the garlic pork belly. It's a cold appetizer of thinly sliced, juicy pork belly topped with spicy garlic sauce. Definitely worth the bad breath you'll get afterwards.

Their beef veggie rice brought out a satisfying ratio of rice to toppings, and the beef in their beef noodle soup held a surprisingly good amount of flavour. The green onion pancakes were much thicker than I imagined them to be, but still enjoyable. 

This is definitely a winner for delicious cheap eats, but there are better spots if you're looking to satisfy a dumpling craving."}
{"text":"I can't stop going here. Freshly made dumplings are delicious. Everything is very good. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great low key place for hand made dumplings.

You see the mom like figure in the window making dumplings and think, this is such a front. But it's not. I was so wrong. 

We're talking homey and delicious and cheap. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The food is average here but it is close to my home. Thus, I come here occasionally. But the food is good enough for me to come back. And the service is fast.

However, I don't like the service. I still don't know if they take credit card, since when I asked the waitress, she said \"you do what ever you like....... Cash is better\". 

Furthermore, I still don't know the operating hours, there is no sign indication for that."}
{"text":"Although it's been bookmarked for some time now, my experience with Chinese Dumpling House was the result of a friend questioning my dumpling knowledge on the basis of my European ethnicity. After a fair shake, I still stand by my faithful dumpling purveyor.
Worked my way across the menu and made sure to hit all the quintessential dumpling house classics. Standouts included the pan-fried pork dumplings, cold sliced pork with soy and garlic, and the crispy sweet and sour pork. Heads up on the sliced pork belly, it's sliced thick, and it's covered in almost a full head of garlic, so make sure you're ready to commit to that dish. The crispy pork was out of left-field for me, but it would be a wasted visit if you didn't check this off the menu. Crispy, tender, sweet and savoury - I shamefully admit it was my favourite dish ordered.
We also tried the pancake with shrimp, egg and chives, pork and chive dumplings, lamb dumplings, pork wontons, and shanghai noodles. I was a little disappointing with the stuffed pancake, it fell a little short for me, wasn't that tasty and didn't hit the spot. The dumplings were fine, but not my absolute favourite. The wraps were fairly thick, and had a distinctly floury flavor and the filling on the pork and drive was a little dry. The noodles were fine, but again didn't really standout to me.
Definitely worth a try, the food was fine but just not good enough to steal my fidelity. Surprisingly low prices compared to what I was expecting."}
{"text":"This restaurant also has a location on Creditview in Mississauga. Same menu but the difference is that you don't get to see the dumplings being prepared. On the negative side, there are too many tables for the size of this restaurant. 
  Choices are steamed or fried dumplings as well as a few soups and noodle dishes. Overall, I much preferred the fried dumplings- a little more flavour than the steamed ones. A regular size hot and sour soup provided me with 2 full bowls and another 3 for takeout. Service was efficient but not exactly friendly- perhaps a language barrier issue as a few of he servers seemed to have a limited knowledge of English, but then again my Mandarin is non existent!
 Would I go back? Most likely, but my first choice for lunch remains traditional Cantonese dim sum so this will remain a secondary option."}
{"text":"My first time at this restaurant and honestly, my first experience with Northern Chinese food. We had fried noodles with chicken, fried pork dumplings and steamed pork and leek dumplings. The fried dumplings we're absolutely amazing, the steamed were good but not great. The noodle dish looked unappealing but it did taste better than it looked. More than enough food for two and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Dumplings are freshly made to order so they can take a while.  For the price you can't beat these dumplings the dough is nice and chewy but not rubbery.  Everything else is sort of mediocre though stick with the dumplings"}
{"text":"If you want to save yourself the embarrassment of walking to the nearest ATM machine, bring cash as they don't accept any other kinds of payments. 

Great dumplings at a reasonable price. I ordered the steamed pork chives egg shrimp dumpling and also the pan fried pork and chives dumplings, both were quit good and fresh but I like the the pork and chives better. It's simple and delicious. 

The resto is relative clean and service is quick so a solid 4 star."}
{"text":"We were in commerce court for some Chatime and decided we can fit a light snack in before dinner. Looking around at the choices available, dumplings caught our eyes. 

Its not the best dumplings I've ever had but it's decent. The prices are fair and the restaurant is relatively clean. Service was kinda slow but it could be that we were there at an awkward time, 4:30pm and there was only one waitress serving 4 tables."}
{"text":"This place served us UNCOOKED pan fried pork dumplings ($6.99) Sooooo disappointed. It was not even busy. 

Came here for the second time, first visit was actually great. I still liked their panfried pancake with beef shanks. and steamed dumplings. But this time, UNCOOKED PANFRIED DUMPLINGS.. just no."}
{"text":"Very fresh dumplings. We usually order the steam dumplings, beef hotpot, onion roll cake, and fried dumplings. I notice they raised $1 to all the dishes, but it is very reasonable price for the quality of food they offer."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner one night and ordered scallion pancake, pork and leek dumplings, braised pomfret, and Korean cold noodles. The scallion pancakes and dumplings were great. Fish was pretty good and the Korean noodles were cold but good. It was a little strange eating cold noodles but it was great because of the heat wave in Canada! Barely saw the waitress. She only took our order and served it and gave us our check. But, we still love the place. Will definitely return when in the area!"}
{"text":"I like to come here for some quick chinese eats! This place specializes in dumplings but I actually prefer to eat their dishes. They have a variety of traditional Chinese dishes and also many types of dumplings. Prices are another big reason I come here because they offer many dishes for very affordable prices! Do not expect much service wise. Just your average quick serving chinese restaurant. 

Food is not out of this world but I do enjoy coming here once in a while because they have a lot of food options. I'm not too big of a fan of their dumplings as the dumpling skin is too thick for my liking. Their chicken and other meat dishes are quite flavorful, but their food is generally on the oily side.

Overall not the best place for Chinese food but also not the worst. It's a good spot for some quick authentic Chinese cuisine where waiting is usually at a minimum!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't taste as good as I remembered it to be.
I ordered the steamed chives pork dumpling. I remember the dumpling skin to be slightly thinner (not as thick) and more meat inside. But then again, can't complain, it was $6 for 15 dumplings.
The pan fried dumplings were still really good thought. Greasy, but pan seared really nicely that the dumpling skin was nice and crispy.
I also tried their ja jang mian (minced pork noodles in peking sauce) - at first i thought they didn't give enough sauce so I asked for more, but actually after adding more it tasted a bit too salty. I remember the sauce supposedly to be more sweet than salty.

It's a nice quick lunch spot."}
{"text":"My family loves the pan fried dumplings from here, juicy and well flavoured. Steam dumplings are also okay but fresh. Wish they had better dipping sauces than just hot sauce, soy sauce and vinegar. They ran out of mustard and tea today. Also good to try are: Shanghai noodles, general Tao chicken, and cucumber garlic salad. Can skip the zia Jang noodles."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I want everyone to get their heads out of their asses.
People are on here complaining about the place being cheap and the service not being top notch. Well, no shit. You wouldn't buy a bag of rocks and expect to pull out diamonds.

Most of the steamed dumplings here are about $6 for 15 pieces. The most noticeable item to this exception is the xiao long bao; I think you only get 8 pieces.

Yes this place does have flaws but it's an understaffed mom and pops shop. I, personally, would've found it easier to have an English speaking server but these are things you have to learn to expect in the GTA.

Chinese dumpling house was renovated since the last time I came here. Still the same layout, but all the tacky chinese paper strips with things u can order are no longer on the walls. and the seats and booths have been reupholstered. The place seems brighter and feels cleaner.

At this time of the year, if you go, hope that you don't get seating at the booths by the entrance. When people come in and out, it gets really cold.

Anyways, onto the food.
For 5 people, we ordered 8 dishes. 4 dumplings, 1 soup, 1 appetizer, and 2 entrees.
The server misread one of our dishes and served us a shrimp entree. Thinking that he served it to the wrong table we let the server know, and he just apologized for his mistake and gave us the dish free of charge. Free shrimp is always a bonus. So for a total of 9 items, our bill came to $65 and change. Think about the price, you're not going to strike gold.

Most people complain about the skin on the dumplings being too thick. Personally, I prefer the thicker skin on my dumplings. Every time I come here, I have to order the pan fried dumplings. I like it a lot for some reason.

Other things to try are of course, the xiao long bao, the beef pancake is alright and, if they still have the deal, the $1 chicken/lamb skewers.

I'm not the pickiest eater, so I do enjoy coming to this place. If you're expecting high class dumpling cuisine, this is not the place for you. You wouldn't go to McDonald's for a gourmet hamburger. You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I asked a server if they make Shanghai Soup Dumplings, and his response was \" no, we only do dumplings\" ..... All the food there was just ok. We are not going back there."}
{"text":"It's been so long since I've been here and this place has completely changed. When it first opened, I had some dumplings here. The place was almost always empty and the food was barely a pass. My mother suggested to eat here the other night when i was craving the leek boxes and i agreed reluctantly. I'm glad she made that suggestion. 

We got there and the place was filled with people; some were waiting in line. We were lucky that a table opened up for 3 people right away and we quickly sat and ordered. The appetizer with pig's ear and cucumber was a bit on the salty side, but delicious. I wasn't crazy about the dough for the leek box (too crispy) but the stuffing is delicious. The water cooked beef was great too. I already told my mother that i need to come back again before I leave Toronto after Christmas. Yum!

**EDIT: I did come back here and we re-ordered the water cooked beef, leek box pancake, and then added the stir fried peapods leaves, a beef and enoki mushroom hotpot dish, and steamed leek and egg dumplings. The stir fried peapod leaves all the small kind but everything else was amazing.  The service here by the owner is phenomenal. My mother told the server that the hot pot was too salty, the girl added a cup of water into the pot, the owner saw this and told us this was not acceptable, brought the pot back in and added chicken broth instead. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant brings with it a super friendly service in addition to their hand-made dumplings. They have a remarkable selection of northern Chinese cuisine to choose from, and I am definitely coming back to try more!!"}
{"text":"Good food that's fresh at a cheap price. You can't go wrong. Steamed dumplings hand made to order. I usually get the pork and leek dumplings. I also really like their pan fried pork dumplings and the red bean pancake, as a dessert. Those are items I always get but I'm definitely trying to slowly test out other items on their menu. I'm always stuffed after coming here. I come here pretty often and it is usually really packed with very tight seating close together. Also, I think they only accept cash."}
{"text":"Service was quick, waitress was kind and attentive. Dumplings were delicious and a great price. It was all home-made and still came out very quickly out of the kitchen.

Recommend."}
{"text":"Last night was my second time there in one week. It really is great value for money. The first night was a little rushed, they closed at 11pm but we sat down at 10:30pm. We were still served but the selection was limited which was understandable because it was so late.  We had just the pork dumplings. I couldn't believe how cheap it was, $4.99 for 15 pieces. We had one to share with my friend.

The second time was last night. We planned on ordering the same thing but we had a few other people with us and we tried out a combination of things. Some different kinds of dumplings, I never really made reviews before so I don't know exactly what was ordered. But overall, this establishment is definately one I would go back to."}
{"text":"I came to Chineae Dumpling House because it fit my criteria: a Chinese restaurant near my house with a four star review average. I'm sitting in front of my take out right now and here's how it is:

The Food: we ordered veggie fried rice, Kung pao chicken and pork and chive dumplings. The dumplings were meaty, the wrapper not too thick not too thin, a little soupy and really flavourful. Kung pao was perfect and yummy, and the veggie fried rice had a nice amount of veg.

Service: ordered take out and both phone and walk in was very friendly and welcoming. 

I've had a lot of problems finding good Chinese in the past. I have enjoyed both Mothers and yummy yummy dumplings but both are a little inconvenient for take out (and mothers doesn't deliver). 

All in all I'm very happy and I think Chinese Dumplings house is my new go-to. Finally!"}
{"text":"Really a 3.5

The dumplings here are good, as one might expect for the namesake of this restaurant.  Their pan fried dumplings are probably some of the best in the area, and the steamed dumplings are all pretty tasty regardless of which filling you pick.  The restaurant has a little windowed area where you can watch the ladies make your dumplings fresh.  Their fried and soup noodles are average, and you can find much better else where.  The cold dishes and hot and sour soup are also fairly average.  The best part about this place, the prices - it's cheap.  However, the place isn't very large so it can fill up pretty quickly.  Having said that, the food comes out quick so turn over is pretty fast too.  If you're looking to satisfy a dumpling craving you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I have yet to try good dumplings in all of Toronto.. judging by the Chinese population in Richmond hill, Scarborough and Markham alone, I would say it's quite disappointing.

To me, a GOOD dumpling must have thin wrap that's not doughy, stuffed with meat AND the juice inside that burns your tongue from slurpping too fast. Chinese Dumpling House has failed to impress me. No juice in dumpling, and the ingredients stuffed inside the dumpling does not seem like it's anything fresher than 2 days in the fridge. MEH"}
{"text":"I was utterly disappointed. Trusting my fellow yelper friends the concrete 4 star reviews along with raving fans.... As a Markham Chinese foodie, my expectations for dumplings may be a tad higher than the downtown Caucasians who reviewed this place.

We ordered some pretty standard Northern Chinese dishes
1) Green onion pancake - it was  a thick chewy dough which resembles a naan bread.. and where's that green onion?
2) Dumpings - skin of the dumping was thick and the juice still managed to leak all over. 
3) Shredded potatoes - basically just potatoes and carrots in watered down vinegar. 

Will i come back? Heck no."}
{"text":"Dumplings! Dumplings! I love Dumplings!

Arrived on a Sunday early evening for dinner.. The place is small and packed! We waited around 20 minute for a table for 2. The waitstaffs are really efficient to let us order our food while we were waiting so our food just appeared right away when we got seated!!

I found the prices here are really reasonable. We ordered a Pork and Chives dumplings ($4.99), Cold Noodles ($5.99),  Beef Brisket Noodles ($5.99) and Garlic vegetables ($6.99).

It is fun to watch those ladies making the dumplings right in front of my eyes! Even they make the wrapping skin! The dumplings tasted really good! Not Salty! with a lot of soup inside and the skin is nice and thin... (YUMMMMMMY)

The Cold Noodles is just average! The soup based not sweet and sour enough. However, it is so nice and refreshing to have it on a Hot Summer Day!

The Veggie dish is excellent value! It taste as good as the $9.99 one that charged at 369 Shanghai Restaurant! 

I will definitely skip the Beef Brisket Noodle! Don't order it! You will be so disappointed! The little piece of brisket and the soup both does not have a lot of flavour! OK! It is more like no flavour! And no amount of hot sauce can ever save this! It is one of the time, I wish the food is smaller, since we hate it! 

I will definitely be back again for some more dumplings!!

The service is fast and efficient! Just get your food and eat it fast and get out quick!

Cash Only!"}
{"text":"The menu here is identical to the other Chinese Dumpling House at Metro Square. 

Since I am with a vegetarian friend, I ended up ordering the mushroom/cabbage dumplings ($4.99) and the Green Onion Pancake ($1.99). 

I am surprise how good that mushroom/cabbage dumplings taste! Though may not as juicy as a meat variety but think about it, I feel a lot healthier and I did not feel I am missing something. You can see how the dumplings are made freshly for you from scratch through the see through divider.

I found the dumplings smaller in size than the one at Metro Square. I don't know because I ordered the vegetarian version here VS the meat version, it might affect the size though...

However, the Green Onion Pancake.. is way too oily! There are oil dripping down each piece and another puddle on the dish! I know it is call \"Green Onion oil cake\" but it is the most oily thing I ever ate!

We were so full even with 2 items.. $5 each with tips and taxes.

It does get busy during lunch hour, even without any lunch specials.
They accepts Mastercard."}
{"text":"This Chinese Dumpling House has no relation with the 2 other Chinese Dumpling House http://www.yelp.ca/biz/chinese-dumpling-house-markham and http://www.yelp.ca/biz/chinese-dumpling-house-markham-2. Though they have the same name in English but their Chinese names are different!

Chinese Dumpling House is located in the Finch Midland Centre. Where over 80% of the business are restaurants. The price here for sure is really good! Cheap Cheap Cheap! $4.99 for 15 dumplings!

We ordered the Pork and Chives Dumplings and the sweet and spicy eggplant. I found the dumplings are really salty! The most salty ones I ever ate and the skin are really thick! They remind me of the ones I got from frozen sections in the Supermarket! The eggplant though is ok... average tasting!

Service is so so.. but if you can speak Mandarin, you will get what you want! I was lucky my dinner mate speaks Mandarin!

I don't think I will be back! There are so many better dumpling places in the Scarborough area!

{"text":"Dinner with Lisa. Loved the steamed/ fried dumplings here. The hot pot lamb was okay. Good for the price"}
{"text":"Waited more than 30mins for two dishes, the other table that came after us got their food, as well as the take out customers. Ridiculously slow, the server was not knowledgable on what customer service is."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and I absolutely love the dumplings!!! I go here with my brother just to eat the dumplings but I have tried their other items as well and it is pretty decent. If you're right on budget I would suggest getting any type of the dumplings and fried rice and you're good to go!! Would definitely come back again :) the dumplings costs $5.99 for 15 piece and the fried rice is in the 10$ range."}
{"text":"This place is Asian dumpling heaven! Be prepared to load up on tons of carb goodness. They have almost every kind of dumpling and fried doughy goodness. You can get a tray of dumplings (15) pieces for 6.50, which to me is such a decent price, I feel one is enough for a person already. Of course you could get dumplings from the T&T nearby but it just doesn't seem as fresh. You can see some Asian ladies at the front making the dumplings on the spot. I haven't tried their other entree dishes but everyone just seems to eat their dumplings 

I really recommend the pan fried pork dumplings, in the picture it is the long one that has a golden crisp on it. Remember They only accept cash and there's two ATMs in the plaza one of which is HSBC."}
{"text":"We were looking for a yummy dumpling option, and boy have we found it! We ordered the General Tao, pork and chive fried dumplings, vegetable fried noodles and the green onion pancake. 
The General Tao and the dumplings were the highlights of the meal. Really flavourful and well made.  The vegetable fried noodles are more like vegetable shanghai noodles and not the crispy thin egg noodles that I thought they would be. It was still a yummy dish but just not what I was expecting. The Green onion pancake was probably my least favourite item, kinda doughy and not the flaky pancake that I was looking forward to. The pancake could have used more green onion.

All in all I will be returning again to get those delicious dumplings!"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of this place. We go here regularly for take out because the seating area is small and always busy. The vegetarian dumplings are always delicious, the beef brisket noodle is meh (the brisket is small, not very tasty) and they have excellent pan-fried beef sandwich. In Cantonese it's called \"Beef Big Cracker\", but it's basically a pan-fried chive pancake with hoisin sauce and sliced beef. 

Cash only."}
{"text":"This is 100% a review for the green onion pancake. 

I've had delicious dumplings at the Chinese Dumpling House, too, but I'm really logging in to Yelp to commit the following to text:

GREEN ONION PANCAKE OMFG IT IS BOMB DOT COM GEDDIT GEDDIT

Um, right. 

So, in a few more words:

the green onion pancake here is warm, and thick, and flavourful, and chock-a-block full of bright green onions. It is crisp on the outside, doughy on the inside and a most affordable $2.99/per. The pancake comes as a ring, cut into pieces. It is delectable. You will want to share with no one. 

Pro tip: I drive up to Markham and buy these to-go, cut them up at home, wrap them in foil and Ziplock 'em, and then freeze them. They are so, so delicious (instead of toast with scrambled eggs! As a side for soup! Just 'cuz!).

Yelp note: cash only for orders under $10."}
{"text":"Ok 3 1/2 out 5 stars is a lie. I've been going to this place for years and it's the bomb.

First off the homemade dumplings are great.  Who doesn't love homemade dumplings? 

Also they have other stuff on the menu that's a fave such as the braised eggplant, the Chinese pancakes with meat, little pork strips and too many more to mention. 

Plus it's cheap!! A must place to go for sure."}
{"text":"I went to Dumpling house and ordered chicken hot pot , spicy beef and two rice. It took maybe 15 minutes to hot pot serve on table then beef and rices. The chicken hot pot I not see much chicken meat in it ..little meat on bone. I think lot mushroom ...is not easy to eat ..is almost choke from that. The spicy beef is moist and I can feel spicy on it. 
For all of that almost cost $30. I think is bit much cuz the hot pot chicken I mean hot pot chicken bone that cost almost $10 , rice for 2 cost almost $4 I think to expansive for price for rice and spicy beef around $11 . I'm sure I will not ordered chicken hot pot anymore $10 for chicken bone and some mushroom which nearly choke me."}
{"text":"Was oddly craving dumplings and this Chinese restaurant has a whole section for dumplings. This replaced Deluxe Noodle and this was first time going here to eat. Their way of ordering food is sort of like a normal Dim Sum place (sheet of paper with the items on it and you write the number of dishes you want on it) they also give you a book menu that has pictures of the dish associated with the number on the menu. As it was our first time here, we didn't know what was good/top thing to eat but I was craving dumplings so went with the pan fried pork dumplings and steamed pork/leek dumplings. My favourite between the both was prob the pan fried pork dumplings because there was a lot more flavour. Both dishes were juicy and they are made in house we also got a beef hot pot dish and I thought that for the $ it's pretty worth and there's a lot of stuff in it.. though I wouldhv preferred the spicy hot pot over the regular. Got 3 dishes for 2 people and it was a LOT of food for $31 after tax and tips. We were satisfied. I would come here again.

Update: went here again and tried the green onion spiral pancake () also got a spicy hot pot with lamb and it was also really good!!"}
{"text":"We love getting dumplings here. Fresh delicious dumplings at a great price. You can see the ladies wrapping dumplings non-stop in the kitchen.

We love the steamed pork and leek dumplings ($5.99 for 15), giant pan fried pork & chive dumplings ($4.99 for 6), braised beef noodle soup ($6.99)
Dumplings were great. 
Noodle soup was a bit on the salty side, broth wasn't flavourful enough, however the beef was very soft and delish.
Their chili oil is not spicy at all. They need to make better chilli oil which will definitely enhance the experience. I love the chili oil at Jim Chai Kee wonton house across the street, that will go amazingly well with these dumplings.
Overall we had a pleasant visit and will definitely come back again and again for more dumplings"}
{"text":"I'm not a local, rather just a tourist from Texas, but I found this restaurant to be quite enjoyable! I checked out all the reviews before I left and I seemed to have had a very different experience. 

First of all, I expected the service to be terrible, as that seems to be the major complaint from other yelpers who've visited this small restaurant. But the waitress we had was very friendly and helpful (not exactly sure if she was the owner or just a waitress). Perhaps it's also because my family speaks fluent Cantonese so ordering and dealing with our waitress was no problem at all. 

Secondly, food was fresh and delicious! It's better than another similar restaurant that sells dumplings in Houston's Chinatown and our Chinatown is known for authentic Chinese food. You can actually catch them making dumplings in the glass window towards the front. The food came out pretty quickly as well. 

We ordered:
- pork and leek dumplings (both the seamed and fried ones/I personally prefer the fried ones) 
- fried noodles with mixed vegetables and pork (very fresh noodles)
- sautéed snow pea leaf in garlic (it was actually called soybean sprouts on the menu i believe)
- pancake with chive and egg
- pan fried spring onion cake 

I would recommend trying all of those besides the noodles. Could be because I'm not a bug noodles fan or we ordered one I just didn't happen to like. 

But the restaurant isn't super clean nor dirty. I didn't check out the bathroom though. If it helps, I found that the tea was great. Just normal tea but very strong in flavor and not bland like other Chinese restaurants.  And I can't help but commend this place for their inexpensive prices!"}
{"text":"Lately, as the weather is getting frosty, I've been eating a lot of dumplings... and I mean a lot! For me, dumplings are the perfect remedy for a cold, cold night. My go-to dumpling place in Richmond Hill is Chinese Dumpling House. 

I tried sliced pork belly with garlic soy sauce ($5.99), a cold dish that I've loved since childhood. This one was a bit salty even though the meat was quite tasty on its own. I wished the soy sauce had been served on the side instead. 

My usual order is a basketful of pork and leek dumplings ($4.99 for 15). Cheap and delicious, you can't go wrong with the dumplings here! If leek isn't your cup of tea, there are 12 other kinds of dumplings to choose from, ranging from lamb to vegetable fillings. 

Pan-fried pork dumpling ($3.99 for 6) are also among my favourites. These are incredibly juicy and flavourful, and I swear I crave them every other week. 

For dessert, I wasn't very impressed with their red bean paste cake ($2.99). The portion was pretty big for the price, but it was extremely doughy and lacking in red bean paste. I personally prefer Asian Legend's version a lot more. 

But nevertheless, I'm thankful that Chinese Dumpling House is always there to satisfy my dumpling cravings when I'm in Richmond Hill!"}
{"text":"Get the leek dumplings -- they're amazing. The dumplings here are made fresh right before your eyes. This is a great cozy restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried this out on a whim and relative proximity to the hotel.  I was not disappointed and it was refreshing to have some real Chinese food rather than the normal New York style Chinese I get in the states.  I had pork and fennel dumplings, rice, and tried the hot and sour soup.  The dumplings were obviously hand made and steamed to order.  Very good but I've had better in Seattle - again this is not a complaint just a comparison.  The service was excellent but I did go after 8:30pm so maybe past peak.  Cost was extremely reasonable and the portions were very large.  I would definitely recommend and likely will be returning to try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Ok just went there again because the default dimsum place was packed and the Grotto Noodle House was not open for at least another 30 minutes and I was hungry.

Went in to get a seat, as expected from a low end Chinese restaurant I was just overhand pointed to my seat by the waitress.  Is it just me or the more attractive physically the Chinese waitresses are the more unattractive their personalities tend to become when they are working at a restaurant.

Anyhoo, after doing the pattern matching between the Chinese order checklist and the menu which had English; I couldn't get someone to provide me the English checklist and their menu does not have numbers to correspond to the checklist.

So just a fair warning to potential customers, don't expect good service from here, at least unless the one that looks like the owner (some middle aged Chinese guy) is around.

I ordered two dishes for myself.  An stir fry eggplant with ground meat dish.  The dish itself was quite good, though it was a bit on the salty side, I think they can do with less, the taste is quite good already and masked with the salt they had put in.

The other disk I got was the pork/leek dumpling.  The wrapper is good again (or at least better than what I had tasted last time) otherwise this would've gotten them one star less.  The dish itself was good except for the high salt content.

I think they may want to to get some rice in order to buffer the salty taste, but I am not a big rice fan so I just had to drink more tea to flush the salt down.

If they fix the salt level, make it more non-Chinese friendly and get rid of those waitresses that do not really want to be there, they may end up with another star or two from me."}
{"text":"Not the greatest variety for us who don't eat pork and would have liked more vegetarian alternatives but you can't beat the prices!"}
{"text":"There should be an option for 0 stars. 
Will not be coming here again - there are far better places for dumplings. This has got to be the most inconsistent restaurant that I have ever been to (been here three times - the third time being the last). 
My friend and I came here on a Saturday night around 8PM. This was a typical worn down restaurant with broken seats, black flys, dirty floor and dirty cutlery that you'd have to clean after. It honestly needs a make over. 
We ordered the beef and mushroom hot pot, pan fried pork and chive potstickers, green onion pancake, and their fried cabbage w/ pork and glass noodles (big mistake!). 
After waiting 15 mins for our food, the hot pot came out first. It came with a very rusty and dirty gas stove and the pot didn't even stay still evenly on the stove top... it was super dangerous. The hotpot itself tasted decent, but the beef was super chewy (we didn't even over cook it..).. 
Nothing to complain about the pot sticker - pretty normal/can get anywhere else.  
Green onion pancake, the last time I was here, it was delicious, but this time... what was this?! Fried dough with burnt onion and absolutely no taste... where was the salt?! It literally tasted like deep fried cardboard.. 
Last but not least, glass noodles... as you can see (my picture), we basically took the whole plate home. This had absolutely no taste - and I am someone who would comment on the saltiness of food items... but this plate needed some adjustments of our own, so we took it home to recook... worst decision ever. 
I regret coming here.. maybe it's just me , but it really sucked.  
The service? That also sucked. They threw our plates down, basically stood there to watch us pay cash, brought the change back and stood here waiting for tips. 

Well, what's my verdict? You can decide ;P
(If you really like this chain, go to the one in Markham)."}
{"text":"Next to office buildings and high rise condos, a small biz mall has become a collection of restaurants. You can miss these places over and over as they can not be seen from the main road.
After needing to turn the car around to go elsewhere, I went past the strip mall which is behind a multi-story building. My wife and I spotted a non-descript red sign and changed our mind from Sushi to Dumplings.
The restaurant is small in size with tight tables and some booths. A small cash register area is next to the fresh dumpling production line of two to three women creating fresh treats.
We ordered the pork and leek steamed dumplings, the pan fried dumpling, the won ton soup, the fried eggplant, and the onion pancake.
The steamed and pan fried dumplings were great. I'd hazard to say that they were on par or better than Ding Tai Fung (another review I wrote.) However, I wish they would have served us the obligatory red vinegar and ginger.
The eggplant was a bit too sweet and overfried - still better than some places that specialize in this dish. The onion pancake was very good - the best so far.
I over-ate! Ouch!
The bill for our meal plus take-out for my kids was very economical. It would have been twice that at the other place.

Hard to find, small place, obvious name, non-descript signage - but what a gem of a find!"}
{"text":"Location :
 It's located in the commerce gate plaza at highway 7 and commerce valley drive west.

Parking;
 A large parking lot and underground parking. Lots of spaces. That being said, ive been here when there have been no parking spots available. Usually between 7 and 9 on or 11am to 2 pm in the weekend. 

Seating:
So we came as a group of 10. Sat at a big round table in the back. We came on a Monday at six for dinner. There was only one other table occupied.

Impressios:
When I first came in I was assaulted by the smell of seafood. It was off putting, made me wonder where the heck my friend suggested. The scent changed in the restaurant itself, smelled like cooking food. Much better

Funny, about 20 minutes in, I looked up and the place was full. Literally no empty chairs!

Service:
Service was fast and the tables turned over really quick. Also, they do a big takeout business. People were coming in and out like crazy

Food:
Prices are pretty inexpensive you get a lot of really good food for the price. I was really impressed! We ordered so much food. There was a point where all the dumpling trays were stacked on top of each other and we had to stand to serve. Everything tasted great. There was nothing we didn't like (yay).

Overall:
This place is called the Chinese dumpling house but its not just dumplings, there are salads, noodles, soups, meat dishes. Yum. But their specialty is Dumplings. Tens of fillings. Lots and lots of choice. Steamed or fried, both were fantastic. I will be back!!"}
