{"text":"Great place for drop in or scheduled classes. Staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. Introduced themselves moments after I walked in for my first class and watched my little one while I went for a bathroom break. Fantastic addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've been to oaks n' acorns both for classes and just to enjoy the cafe/stay n' play. My 3 yr old daughter loved the fairy tale dance class and was so comfortable with the instructor that she did the class without me which is a bonus because I was able to enjoy a nice cappuccino while chatting with some of the other moms there. The space is clean, comfortable and inviting and the owners are very friendly."}
{"text":"This review is for the Early Explorers class only in the Winter term at the Junction location.  I am sooooo disappointed with this place.  I had heard such good things about the Junction location and classes.  The place and class has potential which is why I am giving it two stars instead of one star.  The manager also seems to care, but I don't think she has a good grasp of what is going on in the classes.    Early Explorers is essentially a series of stations set up in the downstairs gym for crawlers and early walkers to explore (think sensory toys, balls, cars, beads, etc.).  The main teacher basically sets up the stations, starts the class with a song and then spends the remainder of the class until bubble time chatting with the parents or sitting silently with the occasional hi to the children.  She will sometimes hand a child a toy or engage them otherwise.  Now I would have though this was the way the class was supposed to be run until we had a teacher one week from the Danforth location.  This woman was AMAZING - she spent the WHOLE time engaging the babies by encouraging them to crawl after toys, climb the blocks and she was \"resetting\" the stations.  You could see that she genuinely enjoyed her work which was such a breath of fresh air after the other instructor.  It is even harder to attend the remainder of the classes after having such an excellent experience with her, because the main teacher at the Junction location frankly seems bored out of her mind and very uncomfortable with the babies during the class.  The other thing that I need to mention is cleanliness.  The class takes place midday and the floor is filthy - there are long hairs everywhere and quite a bit of dust and hair in the corners of the room.  Now this is a class for CRAWLERS.  The teacher has set-up time - it would not take a long time to vacuum or even sweep the area of long hairs which are all over.  The only time that the foam mats and floor were relatively clean was when the supply teacher was there.  Speaking of cleanliness, the supply teacher wiped down all of the toys after class.  I have never seen the main teacher wipe down the toys - she puts them in a box and then puts them in the back room.  I am really hoping that they are cleaned at some point after the center closes.....  In any event I find that the expense of the class is not worth what Oaks n' Acorns actually delivers.  Which is a shame as this class could really be something great with the right instructor."}
{"text":"I'm so excited that Oaks 'n Acorns has opened just down the street from me. I have a 6 month old that will certainly enjoy this place during the winter months.   We came for the Grand Opening and demo classes today, and met the rest of my mommy group here. Not only do kids get to play in this indoor space, but also mommies can get lunch, and coffee.   The upstairs play space has something for kids of all ages. For little infants, there is a mat with toys to discover, and books to read. All toys are sanitized, just place them in a little bin at the end of play time. There is a lego table and magnet board for older ones and a craft table.  Downstairs is the gym. Covered in nice foam tiling, this is the perfect place for little crawlers and walkers to play. There's tunnels and toys and lots of things to discover. My little girl isn't old enough yet, but looking forward to enjoying this space.   Upstairs is another studio, used for music classes. We joined (and signed up for) Stories, Puppets and Songs. It was pretty awesome. A combination of songs and interaction with baby, playtime with a parachute, and puppets. Breanne was great, and the small class allowed for some one on one interaction. I liked how the activities focused on specific cognitive development. It's for 5months old to walkers, but I think younger infants would get the most from it.   In addition to infant classes, there are also kids and toddler programs, camps and you can even rent the space out for birthday parties.   Drop in play is available for $6 a time, or $3 if you get a yearly membership ($59/yr and has some other perks).  Stollers need to be left outside, but they will provide locks if you don't have one."}
{"text":"We visited Oaks 'n Acorns on a rainy spring afternoon after a long walk in the stroller. We were ready for some food and room to stretch our legs. Oaks did not disappoint. On the menu at this inviting play café are sandwiches, soups, pizzas, hot beverages, and baby portions. When you arrive, leave the stroller outside on the sidewalk. (Bring a lock or just babywear.) The front entrance offers coat-racks and boot-mats (you are asked to leave shoes at the door). The entrance with cafe counter opens to a bright space with tables for eating and creative play areas for little ones to enjoy. Because of the no-shoe policy, the floor are relatively clean for little crawlers.  We chose to pay six dollars for a drop-in playtime for our first visit. We ran up a tab, paying for our sandwich and play fee at the end of our visit. The staff were welcoming and friendly, eager to go over and above to help us out!   Downstairs, in addition to washrooms and changing area, is one of two program rooms. Be sure to check out the schedule of programming offered. We've tried the Lil Explorers class which offers crawlers or early walkers a chance to engage with semi-structured play, music, bubbles, parachute, painting, and more!"}
{"text":"Oaks and Acorns is a great place for kids and their caretakers to hang out and have fun. The pricing for play is incredibly reasonable ($6), and that gives you access to the entire space for as long as you want to use it. The cafe is also quite good for basic food and drinks, though it can be hard to find a place to sit at times. The staff are very friendly and will make you and your little one feel welcome. They have an interesting assortment of classes that I'd like to try out, and it seems like there's always something social going on."}
{"text":"I just moved to Toronto and as a newbie to the city, I couldn't be happier to have found this place! My lo is 7mo and I just started bringing him here for music melody classes. Our first experience was so much fun! There are lots of babies around his age and he loves to play with them. They also accept walk-ins for play area which can get quite a bit crowded. They have some coffee, soft drinks and sandwiches for moms, some snacks for little ones. They have high chairs, feeding tables, changing tables and all the other equipment you can need while enjoying your time. Briefly, this place is perfect for new mothers!  Note: not so many toddlers, mostly crawlers and walkers."}
{"text":"As a mom on mat leave, there are really not enough places like these or they are not easily found.  Oaks 'n Acorns is a place where parents can have coffee and light snacks while their children play in a large indoor playground.  There are two levels for indoor play.  For $5 your child can go in to the area and play.  There are also various programs geared towards children of various ages from babies to pre-schoolers.    Here are some things I love about the place: 1. The area is perfect because it is walking distance for me, and there is plenty of side street parking for friends who aren't from the neighbourhood. 2. The service was decent and the place was spotless.  The owners are constantly cleaning up so you're not stepping on any dropped food, etc. 3. You can bring your own food for your kids if you are making it, which is a plus. 4. There is a huge space where you can roam around with your kids and for now it looks really clean.  Those are the things I love about the place.  Here are some things I'm not too crazy about: 1. stroller parking is outside.  It's the first time I've encountered this, but if you don't have a lock they have some for you, or have cable ties that will keep it locked.  Otherwise, you can bring your own.  I know they do this to maximize space but I still don't feel 100% comfortable with that, and boy would it suck if it rained. 2. You must pay $5 for your child even if he/she isn't at an age that can play.  I brought in my 4 month old who spent most of the time sleeping or in my lap.  Granted, she didn't charge me that time, but that was because when I had initially asked about the charge I had a really surprised look on my face.  As he gets older I understand but I thought it was a bit annoying if your child can't really sit up and play with anything you'd still have to pay. 3. Food menu is really limited for adults.  They have some basic sandwiches (i.e. grilled cheese on a panini grill), but it would be great to see some more local baked goods from maybe some bakeries nearby.  I can't comment on the programs they have but they do have a lot and the kids can play free before or after.  I do hope that they stay in the neighbourhood as there are lots of families in the area that would benefit."}
{"text":"We celebrated my 3 year old and 1 year olds birthday here yesterday.  The space was so neat clean and organized.   We were greeted by Iryna, and she helped throughout the party in terms of set up coffee and tea and clean up.  I don't have words to describe how helpful and kind she was.   Additionally,  we held a gym class for the kids  (10-15 kids ranging from ages 2.5-8).   The kids really enjoyed he class and were all really engaged.  The instructor, Sierra,  was so kind and very playful with the children.  We had babies there as well,  they really enjoyed the toy and dance area upstairs.   If I could rate oaks n acorns more than 5 stars I would!"}
{"text":"What a lovely idea for a space devoted to children and family. Unfortunately, their business practices are sub par.The staff is widely under-payed and not treated very well, rather then discuss issues with staff, management takes an iron fist approach of firing people willy-nilly. There are constant Indeed postings for job openings there because the turn-around rate is so high. If you are the sort of person who believes what makes a business successful is the how customers AND employees are treated then I would strongly suggest steering clear of here, There are so many wonderful activity options for children Toronto and many of them treat their employees more ethically then Oaks and Acorns."}
{"text":"As a first time mom this place has been great since my LO started moving around. My house ain't large, y'all. The first floor has a cafe where you can buy drinks or sandwiches. I haven't tried any of the offerings myself but I do see other parents enjoying the food there and it looks pretty good. Behind the café there is a station with Legos, magnets, dolls, a baby carriage, and a little play kitchen amongst other things. We spend some of our time here but generally we go downstairs and hang out in the basement area, which is just a big open space with the foam padded floor and soft foam blocks for babies to crawl on and slide down. There are blocks that are shaped like stairs so the baby can have the experience of crawling up some stairs and then a triangle shape block so that they can practice crawling up an incline or sliding down, there is an area with hula hoops and rainbow coloured balls that my child also enjoys there is also a hammock swing that they have as well as a circular swing that can fit about 3 to 4 babies. They also have bouncy balls that the child can hold onto and practice don't think up-and-down, along with the trampoline. My one year-old getting very excited this place! $6 and u can stay as long as you want!  They also have a membership as well I think it's 50 bucks and then each time you go you pay $3. This location is located also near Tim Hortons so you can grab a coffee on your walk home as well"}
