{"text":"Okay now I think this place is not too bad if you need simple stuff - e.x. a few items to prepare your dinner. The store interior looks quite outdated with small grocery selection so we don't usually get all the groceries here but the produce price is good and it can actually be fresher than M2M. Therefore I am bumping the rating to 3 stars.  Service varies - some checkout staff are friendlier than others."}
{"text":"They have been in business for years!  Have a great selection of foods from meats and vegetables.  Lots of ethnic foods at reasonable prices.  Friendly staff, you can't go wrong at this place."}
{"text":"Bad customer service, went to get some side dish mixed veggie,  the package has no price tag on, ask price from the cashier , instead of telling me the price, the lady mumbling in her language and went back to change a package apparently to be day old instead of what I have picked up,  just a package of kimchi and mixed green side dish cost me 12 cad, in h mart even a chain store ,the price is much lower, will never buy food from there again"}
{"text":"Tucked away off the Yonge street strip, you might not even know this was here. Definitely, a local Korean market that pretends to be nothing else. Much appreciate a well stocked Korean snacks aisle. All your favorites including matdongsan and Ace crackers. Do not confuse these with saltines. One little \"snack\" package has as many calories as a Big Mac. I think these things are made from solidified butter."}
{"text":"Writeoff: Bad selection and any purchase under $10 they will try to charge you a $1 addition to your debit or credit charge."}
{"text":"I have gone to this place for years, and never had a problem.  This place changed hands a few years ago and the service now SUCKS!  Not as busy a store as it used to be (no surprise).  I will never, ever go back there again.  Ever!!  They had better start adjusting their attitude if they want to remain in business.  I went there for years under the old management and since it changed hands, less frequently due to some less than pleasant experiences with the check out staff.  I went back again today and this was the worst experience, to date.  The check out staff person treated me very disrespectfully and I will never go back to that store again.  I can understand now why the store appeared to be not as busy as it used to be on a Saturday and why it rates so low on Yelp.  It just goes to prove how poor service can determine where people decide to spend their money (or not)."}
{"text":"P. A. T. Spring Garden Market is small compare to all those Mega Korean Supermarket that has been opening up lately!   Good if you just want to pick up something small.. like you want something last minute and does not bother to go to Galleria or H Mart up Yonge Street...  Selections here is really limited! But curiously they do carries some Chinese and Vietnamese groceries.... (dried noodles, hot sauces and others)"}
