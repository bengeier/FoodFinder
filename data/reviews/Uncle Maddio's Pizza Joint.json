{"text":"BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!  STAFF RUDE! 

Sunday night (02/26/2017 6:14 pm) at your store.


Order a 6 inch pizza; after seeing customers who came in after me. Leave out with their order; ask cashier what happen to me order. The responds, \" I don't know.\"  Oh, your pizza was dropped.  Ok, when were they going to tell me????  WOW!!!!  Then you think they would have made my pizza first, right???  NO!!! WOOW.......and still was not making my order.  Well, I sat down thinking they would make make my order.  After another person left out; I just ask for my money back.  When trying to get the money back; the person who was taking the pizza out of the oven....................did not have a clue what was going on with the order!!!! Guess what....still have not make my pizza!!!  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!     That was a big fail with your staff on customer service; may be if the pizza maker was not joking around and laughing he would not have dropped the pizza.

Served with Love......NOT AT THIS LOCATION!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh, Hot, and Fast is how I would describe our new pizza place.  And the friendly staff was an added bonus.  The salads were of generous size and the pizza was made right in front of us. Our youngest enjoyed watching the pizza's creation. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Ordered the BBQ chicken pizza during my 1st visit for lunch. It was ok. Unfortunately the server was rude when I ask for to-go box and directed to go get the paper to-go plate myself at the self serve area even though I just witness her gave a box to another patron."}
{"text":"LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! MADE WITH LOVE! Did you know that I LOVE this place?? If you are uptown and walking through the Overstreet Mall, you HAVE to eat here. It's small, but they they fit a lot of tables in there. All pizzas are cooked to order, but you only have to wait a few minutes. I did the 'pick your own' where you pick your crust, sauce, and anything 3 toppings. I tried the gluten free crust with red sauce and grilled chicken on top. LOVE! The gluten free is delicious. They have a couple of desserts at the register. I tried the gluten free one, don't bother. Go straight to the chocolate cola cake slice. Yum. I thought about sprinkling it on my pizza then controlled myself. Why can't Uncle Maddio be my uncle? 

As for the staff, it's a place where people actually like to work! They smile and tell you that your pizza was make with LOVE. When was the last time someone told you they made something for you with love? Anyone? That's what I thought. :)"}
{"text":"Wow, what a nice experience. The pizza is fantastic, as is the healthier fare served (salads, etc.). Gluten free and Vegan options available too if that's your thing. The best pizza in the area in my opinion!"}
{"text":"I have Celiac Disease, so I love a place that I can rely upon not to get me sick. The gluten free pizza here is delicious! My only complaint is that it only comes in a small size."}
{"text":"I had the Big Max pizza very delicious. But what earned them the the 5 stars was the exceptional friendly fast service. I love southern hospitality."}
{"text":"I come to eat here during my lunch break. Maddios pizza is amazing. I dream the whole workday about this pizza, until I get it. Almost every time, I order a pepperoni and sausage pizza... yes I'm gonna try to be more creative with my pizza toppings in the future lol. Definitely worth the walk in heels from the Duke Energy Center. Tip: Don't go there during the 12:00 lunch rush hour... the place is very popular and you will wait a while."}
{"text":"I got a build your own (garlic olive oil, tomato, spinach, feta, balsamic glaze). My new favorite. Yummmm."}
{"text":"I really LOVEEEE this pizza joint! I love how you can stand in front and make your own pizza (like subway lol) and I love the thin crunchy crust! I always get cheese pizza because I'm a vegetarian! I love the love rewards as well, good way to get customers in! I've already had my Free pizza there on to my second one! It's a great family pizza restaurant! The only thing I do not like is the deserts ( brownie didn't taste so great tasted like it hAd no sugar) it was homemade of course but store bought are better! That does not stop me from eating there! 8) I LOVE UNCLE MADDIOS!"}
{"text":"$14 for a medium cheese pizza??? I'm sorry, what??!!  Honestly I never review but need to after this experience. I'm not even a pizza snob and I would rather eat a frozen pizza. Had heard great things but very disappointed."}
{"text":"The salads are tasty and the pizza is just ok. Zablongs is much better, especially for the price. 

The main reason I am giving this place two stars is because the cashier, Angel is extremely inappropriate with female customers. I have not been able to buy a salad or pizza once from this place without being harassed from him. Further, their customer service during promotions (such as Pi day) is terrible. The service was slow, you are refused the promotion price for fine print, and to top it off you get sexually harassed when trying to pay.

I will not be going back and I hope Angel gets a lesson in how to speak to women."}
{"text":"Ordered my Spicy Italian pizza with green pepper instead of banana peppers (Cannot eat them) - Check. Watched them make the pizza correctly - Check. Payed for my pizza - Check. Realized I had waited for over 20 minutes when some kind of veggie with mayo pizza is brought out to me. I return to the register where I explain what I had ordered and the girl turns and shouts \"Here's the Spicy!\". Another worker grabs a box from on top of the oven (No longer hot) and switches it with mine. But wait - This one has banana peppers, not even the one I watched being prepared. They now want to remake a pizza for me. I opted for a refund and ended up with a quick Big Mac in order to make it back to my office for a meeting. I understand mistakes, but the situation was handled so very nonchalantly.No doubt the food is (smelled) good and I may try it again but I'll keep a closer eye on them to thwart a screw-up.

UPDATE - I gave them a second and third try and both times they were spot-on. The ingredients are balanced out nicely with a nice, crisp crust. I did try the eggplant on my last visit and wonder why they wouldn't warm it up if not make it fresh? It was rather soggy so I'd pass on that. Otherwise, worth a visit."}
{"text":"Being from NYC I did not expect to find decent pizza here in NC. Boy, was I wrong. This is the business!!"}
{"text":"This is another go to pizza joint in Charlotte! I got two different pies delivered to me using the DoorDash app and it was worth every penny. I was worried about the size but the pizzas, but they were very filling and tasted amazing. If your a cheese lover I recommend getting the fresh mozzarella, it will take your pizza to another level. Each bite is loaded with toppings, just how pizza is supposed be."}
{"text":"I had a poor experience on two take out pizza's last week as did a few other quests, one just asked for his money back because it was taking too long and another was visibly angry because she was shorted on a take out.

My problem was I ordered two pizzas and when they told me my order was ready they only had one, I pointed this out and the employee stared at the receipt  clueless for a minute then said \"sorry your second pizza is coming out now\", but it wasn't coming out now.  The employee then proceeded to go make it and put it in the oven.

I wish he would have been honest and told me they forgot the second pie.  I would have just paid for the one and not waited for the second.

Staff deer in headlights and medicore pizza."}
{"text":"Fourth time at Maddio's and still loving it!  Everything is fresh and the staff members are very pleasant.  Although the line is long and can seem intimidating, it goes by pretty quick.  Total time is about 10-12 minutes.  Not bad for great and fresh pizza!  At Maddio's you don't have to wonder how long the pies have been sitting on the counter or how many times it's been warmed up! It's made fresh every time.  

Other positive notes:
- The pesto sauce (instead of traditional tomato sauce) is amazing! I love the option of different sauces.  There's something for everyone. 

- A woman behind me ordered a gluten-free pizza so the dough handler made sure he changed his gloves before handling her pizza! Very considerate of cross-contamination for gluten sensitive customers.

- Crispy thin crust that holds up with every bite. 

And as always, it's \"made with lots of love\"!"}
{"text":"Great fast pizza! Whole wheat and  gluten free crust options. Love the quality of the ingredients they use too. Definitely a must try, will be going again!"}
{"text":"Not what we expected (it's a chain, not family owned?) the serving sizes are really big so we were able to split an individual pizza between the two of us. Since it was Monday it was a special and came with a drink. The pizza was surprisingly really good! They have a lot of options that most pizza places don't offer and a large dining area."}
{"text":"A star among the otherwise limited options available in the Overstreet Mall, Uncle Maddio's serves delicious pizza, at a decent price, quickly and with a smile.

Pizzas, sandwiches and salads are made to order right out in front of customers so you can see everything that's going on. Maddios uses a modern conveyor style oven for their pizzas, so once yours is on the belt it's probably 8-10 minutes before it's coming out, piping hot and then straight to you.

I tried the Steak & Blue pizza on my first visit, and it was so delicious I haven't been able to convince myself to order anything different on subsequent visits. You have a choice of white, wheat or gluten free crusts. Some people might get a little nervous about Blue Cheese on a pizza, but it's not overpowering and the balsamic glaze drizzled on after the pizza comes out of the oven creates a perfect flavor profile.

The line forms quickly at lunch, and for good reason. From my desk in a nearby office building to Maddios and back with my carryout order it takes roughly 20 or so minutes, which gives me plenty of time to enjoy my pizza before my next meeting.

The staff is incredibly friendly and efficient. They move fast and they have smiles on their faces. I've never seen a sullen person working at Uncle Maddios. 

The only downside is that the restaurant gets very crowded and there is almost never a table available, but I can't really fault the restaurant for being so popular."}
{"text":"Extremely happy with my visit to Uncle Maddio's in the Overstreet Mall.  The line can be a little long during the lunch rush, but what place in Overstreet isn't?  I thought it moved quick enough that I wasn't pressed for time during a \"normal\" lunch break.

Love the options you have for the pizza.  I did a wheat crust (also has regular and gluten free), then got to pick my own sauce and toppings.  Price isn't too bad for a personal pizza made fresh for lunch.

Could use some more seating to the intense lunch rush, but other than that I didn't have anything negative to say about it. 

Also, if you like their facebook page you can get a coupon for a free pizza with three toppings."}
{"text":"This review is really not for the pizza, because it's delicious.
I am real disappointed in this Uncle Maddio's franchise. I signed up for the member rewards program. I was excited last week to get a text and email from them about a 10\" special they had (2 for $9.50). I hopped in my car to take advantage of it. I wasted my time and gas coming here. As soon as I pulled up, I saw a sign in a window that said this location is not participating in this particular special. Then I went inside and there was another sign with the same notification. I talked to a young lady behind the counter and she confirmed, telling me the owner wasn't going to honor this special. Dammit I want my gas money back and time! If you are going to text me and email me, at least put a clause in there that says all franchises do not participate and you may want to call and confirm before wasting your time. I'm pulling my rewards membership and not going back."}
{"text":"I love Maddios pizza DEFINTLY my favorite and the reg employees r always nice. But at this location we went last night and a female manager was working at around 9pm. Just had horrible attitude towards customers and her employees. Needs to be retrained everyone else was amazing. Food was fast and awesome as always."}
{"text":"Their pizza is \"made with love\"!! Such amazing service and makes you feel good to hear that every time you order food!

This is a great lunch spot that is conveniently located in Overstreet Mall (basically the connecting area of BB&T, Wells, and Bank of America) and I love treating myself to pizza every once in a while for lunch, since it is right downstairs!

I usually get the BBQ chicken pizza on wheat bread. Pretty large portion for around $8. They also have gluten free bread!

It gets pretty crazy busy at lunch but I have never waited more than 15 minutes or so....which is pretty amazing considering they cook your pizza right on the spot."}
{"text":"My mgr was planning on a team pizza happy hour kind of celebration after work & chose Maddio's as her place

Not sure exactly what made her choose here over Libretto's - who in my opinion has awesome pizza PLUS they deliver.....Maddio's doesn't!

So ordering 7 pizzas required several of us to walk over & schlep it all back to the office

The pies were all of the thin variety & the crusts were pretty flimsy-floppy.  And I'll admit I'm a thick crust fan but I can definitely appreciate a thin crust ...but at least give me something that will stand on it's own & not drop the toppings all over the plate

Flavor was okay - had better, had worse.  The sauce to cheese ratio was average as well - nothing remarkable

We had a lot of leftovers, ranging from the standard pepperoni, to meat-lovers, to veggie & the team was happy to finish up the bunch, the following day for lunches - but I didn't partake.  Happy Hour tastings were enough for me

So overall, this was a decent assortment of pizzas but I'd personally seek elsewhere before coming back"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! So many options. I tried the BBQ and Portobello Pesto and both were fantastic. Crust is great. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I was really surprised at how good this place is.  Especially for being in a food court type area, and they have lots of seating.  They offer made to order pizzas where you see them cutting up the dough in front of you, and you get to select your fresh toppings, before they place in the over and then deliver to your table.  The individual pizza is perfect size for lunch and you can choose between 3 different crust types (original, wheat or gluten free).  The staff are super friendly staff too.  I would give them more stars, but as you can see in my other reviews, I really am a pizza connoisseur."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch so needless to say I didn't have too much time to spare.  I ordered the BBQ chicken chef made pizza and it was not what I expected.  I have been craving this type of pizza for a while and really anticipated it but I when I saw it I was so disappointed on seeing onions on my pizza which was NOT advertised.  I HATE onions and If i would've saw it I would've left it out as I did the corn.  I did not have time to get another pizza made so I didn't say anything.  Not sure if I'll try them again."}
{"text":"We were hoping to have pizza at Mama Ricotta's, but there was a king waiting list to be seated.  So, we decided to try Uncle Maddio's which we passed on our way to Mana Ricotta's.

We were a bit apprehensive about going in since there were only a few people in the restaurant.

Once we had ordered our pizza we were showered with attention and a welcome from all the staff.

We ordered The Big Max.  It was delicious and the sausage was especially tasty,

The assistant manager was very kind and checked in with us to see if everything was okay.

We also enjoyed the local beer that was on tap.

We hope to go back again soon."}
{"text":"I love pizza first off. The uptown area does not offer that many pizza options IMO, so at times I'm wandering into other 'hoods for pizza. Uncle Maddio's is the latest food option at Overstreet Mall (a very bland building to me). It's unique because you can see your pizza being built in front of you. Within ten minutes, your order arrives ready to be consumed. Staff is very friendly. It's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and amazing options. One can go healthy with the whole wheat crust. Their marinara has a nice mix of tangy with herb. Excellent choice of toppings. Super friendly staff and the place is clean and inviting. My favorite is pepperoni, green peppers and red onions cooked extra crispy."}
{"text":"The pizza here is really good, as are the canolis. The flavor, the sauce, the cheese, the crust...just took me way back to Brooklyn. My daughter and I really enjoyed the pizza and have had pleasant experiences each time we've been here. I have no complaints, only compliments. Keep it up Maddio's! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered an individual sized pizza with three toppings. I love that they have so many options, you are limited to how many you get before you get charged extra. I thought the price was fair for the location. It took around 10 minutes, the staff were super friendly. I got my pizza carry out but the restaurant looked cleaned! The pizza was decent - it wasn't my favorite. I have had better, but I still give it four stars. I would go back if I didn't have many options to choose from, but it wouldn't be my first choice!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday it was very good. I had steak and black olives pizza. Staff very helpful. Will definitely go again"}
{"text":"Awesome \"breadsticks\" ... They're actually garlic pita triangles. I think $1.50 for 8... Definitely recommend these bad boys anytime you go. Pizzas are delicious, and you watch them make it so you know it's freak and everything is clean! They also have great breakfast calzones, but they are a little messy. Two thumbs up for this pizza joint!"}
{"text":"A nice variety of different kinds of pizza. You can also make your own. 2 choices of crusts. 

Overall the buffalo chicken pizza and peachy kean pizza were both pretty good. Service was good. Food was hot and came out quick. Worth going again!"}
{"text":"I just visited Uncle Maddios for the first time and I am very pleased. There gluten-free pizza is delicious! You never think you'll enjoy good pizza again when you are told to go gluten-free, but here you can enjoy safe gluten-free fast pizza with local ingredients. I ordered a GF pizza and the employee immediately changed his gloves for me (I always feel weird asking and here I didn't have to), he called out that there was an allergy coming down the line, and got my sauce from what looked to be a different container and ladle so no cross contamination!

I will definitely be back, and bringing friends."}
{"text":"For 2 9\" pizzas and drinks we paid $17. Pizzas were thin and crispy, how an authentic pizza should be, in my opinion. I love the 'create your own' pizza option and they have a large range of toppings to choose from. Unfortunately the Monday deal only limits you to 3 toppings but don't fret the additional toppings are .50. The guys making our pizza were extremely helpful, as this was our first time. He recommended some toppings and even helped save us a few bucks. All in all we'll definitely be back for more pizza. Go Maddio's!!"}
{"text":"I loved having the option to make a healthy pizza. Thin wheat crust and lots of veggies - yum. They also have crushed ice for drinks - my favorite to chomp."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm saddened to even have to post this but other consumers should be aware. I ordered pizza from this location through an online app, as I have done on numerous occasions. Due to no fault of the business or myself, the order appeared on the company's end a little odd...for example there were essentially no toppings for a create your own pizza. Upon following up to investigate this issue, the lady who answered the phone indicated that it did seem weird. If the order seemed weird, why not call the consumer? Irregardless a pizza was delivered...a pizza that did not match what was ordered nor did it match the order the company actually received! Where then did they come up with what to put on my pizza?  Again, a simple call to the consumer could have avoided this issue. Upon discussing the matter further with the person who answered my call, I asked if I could get a replacement pizza (ie what I had originally ordered). Initially she said yes but then indicated that I could purchase another pizza and would have to resolve the refund issues with the delivery service separately. This seemed so confusing...especially since they made an incorrect pizza irregardless of the system error on the part of the delivery service. It's my understanding, the company gets money for the food ordered since a separate fee applies to the delivery. If a company gets your money for a pizza, I don't think it's too much to ask for the pizza you ordered."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure why this place has 3 1/2 stars. Sure, it's cheaper so it's not the same as a full restaurant. For a cheap restaurant, it is really great. The service is very friendly and fast. The deals they have, like the 1/2 off alcohol on Wednesday's makes it very affordable. The pizza creation process is fast and friendly, and let's everyone enjoy what they personally prefer. I would definitely return and recommend."}
{"text":"The newest addition to uptown decided to make their opening 'free pizza' day....which was fine by me since I love anything free:-).  The staff was very energetic and worked pretty fast despite the opening crowd. I ordered a wheat crust pizza with garlic infused olive oil, spinach, mushrooms, and tomatoes.  The veggie toppings are endless and all garden fresh. The crust is thin and crisp, but lacks in flavor.  Overall a good pizza but I think I may opt for a salad on my next visit."}
{"text":"Love their pizzas, kinda of a jump in price from individuals to the next size but totally worth it. They give free birthday individual pizzas if you sign up for an account with them and they don't spam you with emails or anything just specials that are really worth it. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We wanted to get a local pizza, and fell in love with this place! We popped in on a Tuesday, and was delighted to see the staff wearing football jerseys! It's awesome when businesses let their employees do this during football season. 

The food was amazing! I ordered the 9in chicken pizza, and it was delicious! I was surprised at how much food I got! My wife had a salad, and it was HUGE! When they delivered it to our table, her eyes went big! That's when you know you got a good portion! Definitely stop in on Wednesdays as they have half price beer and wine! 

Needless to say, we will totally be back!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I don't work uptown anymore but I miss Maddio's and I think I underrated them at a 3 before, so I'm upping it to 4."}
{"text":"So, I was at Petco and decided to drop in here to grab a 'take and bake' pizza. I was told they did this by a friend. I walked in and they guy at the pizza line had no clue what I was talking about and then he decided he had heard of it but had to go ask how to do it. So, he walks into the back area and comes back and says that they DO do this. Then I asked him a question about reheating at home and he had to walk back and ask again. So, then a girl comes out and I go through all the questions again. She had the answers and started to prepare my pizza. There was no line so I figured it would be fast because they said they only half bake it. Well, when I finally got it, I just grabbed it and left to run my next errand... 45 min later I am at home and am ready to pop the pizza in the oven and low and behold, it was fully cooked! I ended up eating cold pizza and it wasn't very good. Especially for the price. Won't be back."}
{"text":"They offer gluten free pizza. When you tell the servers you need gluten free, they change their gloves and let the other servers know there is a gluten free order coming. That's nice. I appreciate the effort. The pizza itself is delicious. It's a pretty big pie, maybe medium sized, for a single person."}
{"text":"Our first visit. It's a nice addition to the neighborhood. The assortment and variety of toppings is vast - my kids even found their own winning combinations. Didn't take too long to cook and we dove right into our pizza. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Good, reliable pizza that's served quickly with most any topping you'd ever want.  My kids love the \"Moe's like\" approach to customizing their pizzas.  Only real con is size of restaurant .. It's a tad small but not a big deal.  Good local beers on tap as well."}
{"text":"Love this place for so many reasons. It is so close to where I live and the staff is so very friendly. The food is fresh and prepared right in front of you. You can have fresh pizzas and fresh salads anyway you want them. The service is excellent. The establishment is clean and bright. I am a regular here now!"}
{"text":"Very fresh ingredients. Staff is very friendly. Their pizzas are delicious. I love the steak and bleu."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! I wasn't too excited to see another pizza place in Charlotte but this is my new favorite. They assemble the pizza in front of you and then bake it there. The pizza is really tasty and my stomach is growling as I write this review! Tons of options for toppings and I like the wheat crust, although they also have traditional and gluten free. I brought my picky 9 year old niece and she loved the pepperoni pizza. The Maddio special is around $8 and is a great deal--small pizza (it is very small but filling), side salad and drink. The Greek side salad was delicious and a good serving. The cookies are huge and delicious. Staff is very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"My first time at this place, I always walk by it hoping to try it out soon. I was in the mood for their salads and I ordered the chopped salad and replaced the bacon with chicken and had italian dressing. I did not get a combo or any add ons, and they were going to charge me for extra dressing and for chicken? The chicken was to replace the bacon, not add to it. The cashier did apologize and remove the extras. The customer service was good, but then when I opened my salad there was basically a pound of chicken on my salad so I took 3/4th's of it off and started to eat my salad. I only took 5 bites and threw the rest away. Every time I took a bite, there was this terrible taste, I'm not sure if something wasn't seasoned right, or something was old, but, I was pretty disappointed that I wasted $9 on a salad I didn't even enjoy. I hear the pizzas are good, but my salad selection I don't really recommend."}
{"text":"I was fortunate to attend a Grand Opening for Uncle Maddios downtown last week... And saw one up here in Huntersville and thought I'd see how these do it up here. They did not disappoint. Fresh tasty ingredients, outstanding customer service, clean facilities. Must try if you've never been here before. The whole family can get whatever they like... No fighting!"}
{"text":"Seriously AWESOME pizza and OUTSTANDING service! We had a gluten free vegan pizza and I can honestly say... It was the best I've EVER had. My friend is actually allergic (vice preference) and they actually made our pizza at separate  station! If you're allergic...then you know how impressive and important that is. The crust was tasty and crispy... Ingredients super fresh. You MUST try this place.... GF, Vegan or just a pizza connoisseur!!!"}
{"text":"I stop in here occasionally to pick up a quick salad for lunch.  There's usually a long line at lunchtime, but this moves very quickly.   If you order a pizza, be prepared to wait for it to cook - but the salads come out sooooo very fast.  This is the one reason I will stop in here.  I find the chicken that goes on the salads to be too salty and the bacon bits to be too soggy/chewy.  It's not bad, exactly, just not great.  Salads from here will do in a pinch, but I don't consider this to be a destination lunch.  I can't speak on the pizzas - though they do look quite tasty."}
{"text":"Uncle Maddio's is a really good spot. It took over that location in King's Dr that used to be a Caribbean joint. The people in there are great. They greet you when you step in the place and are real helpful if you're a newbie like me. I went during lunch so the prices were really good. Nice crowd but not too packed. I guess the secret isn't out yet. Check this place out."}
{"text":"I really like their pizza it is thin and you also get to choose wheat as well I think gluten-free too!"}
{"text":"Not sure what's with the ordering/ paying process. It's odd & awkward. & the \"made with love\" thing is tacky to me... this is a chain restaurant, there is no love! But that aside, the food itself is good. I usually go for the pizza. Black & bleu or spicy Italian."}
{"text":"i had a late lunch early dinner there I had the margherita pizza witch was really good . the cashier was really nice he told me that he was glade I was there for my first time eating there . I will be deftly be going back for the good food and friendly survive."}
{"text":"Nope, Nope, Nope.....Never Again!

This location is very poorly managed with even worse customer service.  I will never be going back to this location as a result.  I ordered and paid online, showed up about 5 minutes early, which may have been my mistake.  I checked in at the pickup counter, the girl told me that my pizza was coming out soon and asked me to take a seat so she can bring it out when ready.  After sitting there for 10 minutes another employee walked by and asked if he could help me.  I gave him my name and explained that I was waiting for an online, to-go order.  I waited another 5 minutes and then decided to go to the count to check on the progress.  I found that my pizza had been boxed and sitting on top of the oven.  I asked how long it had been sitting up there and was told about 15 minutes.  The most disappointing aspect of this experience was that there was no offer to make a fresh pizza or comp the meal.  I do not recommend this location to anyone.  If I could have given ZERO stars, I would've."}
{"text":"Excellent taste and quality of food and ingredients. Very good customer service. I will find an excuse to go back soon."}
{"text":"Delicious gluten free chicken sausage, broccoli, spinach w/corn & black bean relish on pesto base. I question a reward program of \"free pizza\" when you still have to pay for the GF bread. If I pay full price normally for GF, I'd expect GF to be included.  
Hence \"free*\" (with conditions)."}
{"text":"Uncle Maddio's is such a great find! Quick, tasty, and allows everyone in the family to get something that they like.

Uncle Maddio's takes a fast-casual approach to pizza and salads. They offer interesting menu options but the best route is \"Build-Your-Own.\"

Uncle Maddio's offers so many options. They have regular crust, whole-wheat, and gluten-free options. For sauces, they have tomato basil, garlic olive oil, zesty BBQ, herb pesto, and more. The toppings list is pretty outrageous--spinach, steak, meatballs, roasted corn, baby Bella mushrooms, banana peppers, jalapeños, prosciutto, celery, broccoli, grilled tofu, green and black olives, pineapple, and more! And of course, the cheese!! Mozzarella, ricotta, fontina, goat, blue, cheddar, fresh mozzarella, and DAIYA, which makes THIS VEGAN GIRL SMILE AND SAY CHEEEESE!! 

Uncle Maddio's is a super easy take-out or eat-in option for weekdays or weekends. Join the Rewards program and get great deals texted to you!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, from the OWNER at that. Completely messed up my order twice, never apologized and overcharged me. Trust me, avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"The pizza there is great for how quick it takes them to make it. The jamaican jerk, the big Max and bbq chic are all good choices. The salad are also great, it's not just the typical plain iceberg lettuce."}
{"text":"FOOD
I built my own pizza which consisted of wheat dough, topped with tomato-basil and herb pesto sauce, Mozzarella cheese, ham, pineapple, and pepperoni. It was delicious! 5/5

SERVICE
The staff member puts your pizza together. They're friendly and efficient. The line was long but it moved relatively quickly. 4/5

FINAL THOUGHTS
I highly recommend Uncle Maddio's for your pizza cravings!"}
{"text":"Love this place....just a short walk from my work.  The pizza is crazy good.  You can make up your own or get their specialty pizzas. They have this steak, prov, mushrooms, and balsamic pizza that is just plain incredible.  For a fresh made pizza it actually pretty fast service.  Definitely worth going to over and over again... Staff is always friendly as well."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great customer service. I came based on good reviews and wasn't disappointed. I have a gluten intolerance and the worker was kind enough to change gloves to prepare my pizza with minimal cross-contamination. There's a huge selection of toppings, and the pizzas are served quickly. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Nothing special really. Basically the subway of pizza joints, the pizzas come out cooked on the bottom with watery toppings, beware of running it through the oven again, the bottom gets burned. All in all, nothing to write home about, I thought it was funny they gave me my food to go in Harris Teeter bags!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying for being a chain pizzeria, it's EXCELLENT! From the crust to the delicious fresh toppings! Everything taste very fresh! Josh is an excellent employee! Friendly, courteous and helpful! He is what management should strive for.

The concept is popular where you pick your dough,sauce, and toppings and I haven't had a bad experience yet. The service is fast and friendly and their prices are fair. They even offer you a free pizza for simply registering with them
Online. You accumulate points and receive a free pizza every 10 points. 

I would definitely recommend if you're not feeling the common chain pizzerias and want to try something different and delicious."}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out for lunch today and I was impressed. Plenty of fresh toppings to choose from, a few dough options, and quick service put this place near the top of my lunch spots.

I was boring and went with a plain pepperoni; delicious, but looking forward to my next trip to load up on toppings. 

Little under $10 for a small pizza and a soft drink."}
{"text":"I have now had their pizzas, paninis and breakfast. So far I have not had a dissapointing item yet. Their personal pizzas are perfectly sized for lunch. THeir Chicken Basil Panini certainly is a snadwich to try and their Mederteranian breakfast wrap is delicious. These are just a few favorites.
Really, you can't seem to go wrong unless you are in a rush because everything is made fresh."}
{"text":"So I'm giving this review 2 stars because of the service. We first walked in, weren't greeted and have never been here before. Our experience with the pizza maker Ryan was very rude & made us feel uncomfortable. Other than that our pizza and salad turned out great, but the customer service was not good at all."}
{"text":"I'm always searching for great pizza in the Lake Norman area. I wasn't expecting Uncle Maddio's to be great given that it's a chain, but I was pleasantly surprised! Pizza is full of flavor, and they nailed the crust. This is certainly a top three choice in the area for me. A little more expensive compared to Tony's, Davino's, etc but not a deal breaker! 

Overall, I definitely recommend this joint!"}
{"text":"4 stars is about right.  You get  a solid amount of pizza for about $8-10.  The biggest downfall is the time this restaurant takes.  If there is anyone in front of you, be prepared to wait a long time before you eat.  The pizza is made fresh but the oven takes about 10 minutes.  The end result is delicious but for a lunch market things can take some time.  I recommend the buffalo chicken as it is delicious."}
{"text":"I'm only writing this review b/c it's the second time this week the customer service has been on pist ! But I will only discuss today b/c I hate liars. So my big pregnant Axx orders a kid meal online @12:10 they said it will be ready @12:40 I get there purposely @ 12:45 b/c Tuesday when I went the food order wasn't ready until 10 minutes after I got there. So anyways I go to the counter the skinny girl with the bun asks the other girl to give her my orde she says it's not here. She then asks the rude ass pizza artist (the guy responsible for making pizza) & he snaps and say I made ever order up there...she comes back & says it should be done in a few minutes it's coming down the line okay cool...it wasn't until I waited 13 minutes & noticed it's not coming down the line the two people behind me were getting salads & then the pizza artist ain't making shxx I then ask for a refund she goes it's done now. A whole lie ! B/c they not boxing any pizza & I didn't see shxx coming down the line....in conclusion I got a refund & left...but my whole thing is say I'm sorry for the inconvenience, apologies we got behind & missed the order something... people order online for the convenience...smh"}
{"text":"My daughter, fiancé and I love this place. So family friendly. Sunday is Kids Eat Free day, so always a win! It's basically a Salsaritas set up for the Italian world. Pizzas, Sandwiches, Salads, and all the choose your own toppings you could want. The Caprese Salad is amazeballs...but then again, so is everything else. Get in your car and go...now."}
{"text":"I would argue that uptown Charlotte is fairly limited in its range of lunch time options, so it was a great change for my buddies and I to try something new like Uncle Maddio's Pizza Joint. I'll point out that the culinary competition is rather low in the overstreet mall considering the only three restaurants next to Maddio's are Chick Fil A, Salsarita's and Just Fresh (all equally mediocre). \"How Do You Roll\" lasted a couple of months here, but its presence dissipated in a matter of days once people realized their \"sushi\" was 98% rice and ridiculously overpriced. On the other hand, Maddio's deserves to be in a class of its own because Fast Casual restaurants are hard to find around here (you pretty much just have Noodles & Co., Chipotle, Jason's Deli and Vappiano's... and that's like all Charlotte has to offer in this segment).
 
Maddio's showcased item is of course, its pizza and I'll admit that I was pleasantly surprised. I'm a huge fan of thin crust pizza, and having just come back from Milan, I'm always searching (perhaps in vain) for that same delicious and savory crunch I experienced there. Nevertheless, my favorite part of a pizza is its tomato sauce and I really liked the version they have here. You can smell fresh garlic and perhaps some basil? It's also not too watery or dry. There are other sauces I have yet to try... I was eyeing the \"tomato bbq\". As far as pizza crusts go, this one is certainly acceptable. It's very crisp and holds its shape when you pick up a slice. I do like this pizza much better than Vappiano's which a bit more doughy and its tomato sauce tends to be over salted.
 
Disclaimer: You can't expect pizza at a fast casual joint like this to be as good as a wood-fired pizza from your favorite Italian restaurant because, let's be real, you wouldn't be able to churn something like that out with the same efficiency that they have here. I only waited 5-6 minutes for my pizza to arrive steaming hot to my table (I tried the spicy Italian on traditional crust - you could also go for the wheat option). For what it is (a  $7 - $8 individual pizza), you'll find yourself eating every last slice. Toppings are varied and fairly good quality - you can even create your own pizza. I like that you can see your pizza being made through the glass window, so you know exactly what you're about to eat.
 
The salad we ordered paled in comparison to the pizza and some of the sandwich options I saw at people's tables, but that could just be because they stuck to a simple salad menu with generic dressings that every other restaurant has. I think I'll just stick to pizzas when I come here.
 
There are lots of options for everyone and if you have that \"I've tried one pizza, I've tried them all\" mentality, Uncle Maddio's just might make you rethink that philosophy.

{"text":"Very nice staff, greeted quickly & explained how the ordering works since my husband has never ate there & I went one time with friends.
The place was clean & pizzas came quickly. Their sweet tea was bomb!
I got the jerk chicken, it's ok. I prefer the buffalo chicken one that I tried before.
My husband got the max, he really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Ate here with friends for lunch the first time ever. Really good.!!! I got the buffalo chicken pizza. My friends got the max & the other requested a chicken alfredo with spinach & mushrooms. Looked really good!
We left full & happy.
Edit: just ate here again 2-2-18 I got the 4 cheese pizza & added pepperoni... Really good & their salads look amazing! Also they have vegan options as well"}
{"text":"First time - AWESOME PIZZA and SERVICE. The pizza ingredients are fresh and you can custom any pie. Price is right, the place is well kept and you're in and out in no time if you need to be. 5 Stars for Angel - he was very attentive"}
{"text":"I like the fact that you order at the counter then sit down. That means you don't have to wait for a server, which is great for when you have kids or are really, really hungry. This is the quickest we've ever had pizza served to us. 

We went none traditional and ordered the whole wheat crust, forgot we even ordered whole wheat, it was that good. They also have gluten free crust. 

Kids pizzas turn out pretty small, so I don't recommend them for bigger kids that eat a lot. 

Overall, a very nice alternative and a new fav."}
{"text":"Try the Greek pizza, taste like a gyro but better . I like the crispy bread ,great flavor"}
{"text":"I've here twice this week and I can say that consistency is a strong point. The ingredients are fresh and the staff is very attentive. I've had the pizza and a salad so far but I'm looking forward to trying more menu items! I wish they had more locations! 

Good job!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this restaurant the other day and I'm so happy I did the pizza here is really great I love the crust the salad is also very good I came here twice in a row"}
{"text":"I love being able to choose from all the different options Maddios has to offer!! I really love this place and the food is incredible!!"}
{"text":"Average pizza and average service.  It simply is not convenient to wait in line for 10 minutes to start ordering your pizza. I don't understand the 5 star reviews."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place.  The pizza tasted like a bad frozen pizza."}
{"text":"They were awesome , even when my brother accidentally spilled his drink. One of the workers joked with my mom as he cleaned it up. My mom got two free kids pizza for free ( Sunday special) idk how but she said don't question it. The pizza was delicious and I'm craving another pizza & salad. The restaurant is cute and very clean, I also love the vegan options they have."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Maddio's for lunch. It was so convenient! 

The menu board was a bit hard to read and only had their newest specials. Even the build-your-own wasn't great because it said to pick three toppings but never provided a list of what toppings there were. Later I noticed these small pizza plates stuck to the side wall adjacent to the menu which listed some of the pizza options still available not on the new menu, but it was nearly impossible to read the ingredients list for those options. 

On the other hand, the place was kind of like the Subway of pizza. You choose your bread--regular or whole wheat--and size, then you either get one of the pre-decided combinations or you choose your own toppings. Everything was fresh and you could taste that difference. Plus, if you sign up for their rewards program, you get a free 9\" pizza just for signing up and it's essentially a buy 10 get one free system. 

I am really looking forward to coming back and trying their foldwiches which are--you guessed it--taco-like sandwiches made by folding a pizza dough in half (think calzone that doesn't get rolled closed) as well as their breakfast options (although those look a little small). 

Reasons for not four stars: menu/ordering issues as stated above, slowness of cooking time (there is an order online option which I might try in the future), lack of seating and tables which have residual oil on them (I'm in my work clothes for goodness sake!), and the fact that it cost $0.50 for an extra topping on a 9\" pizza when there's more than one inch of topping-less crust (so ~7\" of topping space). That's like three olives! Crime!!! Honestly, there is too much uncovered crust on these babies. I'd suggest offering dipping sauce..."}
{"text":"Even though I kinda miss the Sbarro's in the Overstreet Mall this place is a definite upgrade.  I think it replaced the bagel place, but I'm not too sure without doing some more research... the fact that I can't remember what was in place before probably says a lot.

I only got a salad, but the places concept really intrigued me... personal pizza made right in front of you.  

Went during the tail end of the lunch rush so there wasn't much of a line, but you could tell the workers were just \"bouncing\" back from a busy busy period.  They were still friendly and I was surprised how much chicken I received in my Santa Fe Salad.  The house made, chipotle ranch dressing was pretty darn good - had the right amount of kick and they put it in containers so I had some control over how much dressing went on my salad.

Will have to come back and try their pizza, but their salad is definitely a solid lunch option for me and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I walked in and it was apparent how things worked there was a large sign with the menu, over what seemed to be a food making station, and smiling faces greeting us. 

I'm huge on Customer Service so this immediately made me feel like this was going to be a good experience. 

The little one got a kids meal with just cheese so nothing too fancy, he ate all of it and a cookie which was impressive it was kinda big for a kids pizza. 

I was super confused about what to order salad, pizza, flatbread thingy, there was so many choices. The chick behind the counter suggested the special which was a personal pizza for like five bucks. 

I got prosciutto, sausage, and sun-dried tomatoes. 


My bill was 20 bucks, I don't know how, I got a five dollar deal and a five dollar kids meal, and then the two cookies and my medium drink was another 10 bucks?!? I'm sure it's right, the cookies were huge. It threw me off a little, but I was getting hangry, and my kid was annoying the hell out of me so I just paid, I'm normally that annoying person who questions b/c I've noticed people get rung up incorrectly a lot!  

We took our little number & my cup, his milk, & our cookies and found a spot in the cramped dining area. It's not really cramped per se but the booth are really spacious, but the aisle space it's sort of tight when more than one person is walking down. 

There's a drink machine with Coke products and all your flatware, napkins, lemons, and lids & straws. 

It was really clean and I like the ambience. It was upbeat and there was a good mix of people but the wait was like no time at all. 

The pizza was fantastic! It came out piping hot the sauce was absolutely phenomenal I could taste the spices. It was almost like I had made it at my house myself. There was plenty of toppings and cheese. And let me tell you about these cookies! They were huge, tasted amazing, perfectly baked, and had the right amount of morsels! We got a chocolate chip, and oatmeal w/ white chocolate chips & crasins. 

Overall great experience, we'll go back next time I make a Trader Joe trip because the salads looked great!! 

They do say to order online to skip the wait which I might do next time that way I can look at the menu too."}
{"text":"I've been there twice. The first time I had the Maddio's House salad.  It was a fresh, good sized salad, and it came with some flatbread, which was decent. The second time I ordered the individual Jamaican Jerk signature pizza (I posted a pic), and it was quite tasty!  It can take a while to get your food order, but it's expected as Maddio's is new and quite popular with the Uptown lunchtime crowds. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"OMG my daughter has done it again! She found this little place on Yelp and we decided it was a trying day and I am so glad we did. I created my own pizza I chose prosciutto spicy sausage and bella mushrooms totally delicious. My daughter had the shop Cobb salad it was delicious as well and huge. And for my little god-daughter we ordered her the kids pizza pepperoni and she ate it all and wanted more. Though this is a chain restaurant is not very gimmicky the ingredients is are high-quality the cheese and the toppings are all great tasting. I definitely will be coming back and trying other menu items I love it when I find a great food find."}
{"text":"I ordered the Siracha chicken pizza on white bread...  sweet and spicy flavor..very tasty.  Definitely a recommendation.  Fresh spices nothing canned."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, great sauce- the salad was fresh with good dressing, fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Love this place.... Great pizza and love the gluten free crust....Only thing I would change was to add the nutritional values"}
{"text":"This place can get pretty busy during lunch time. This was my first time here. The gentleman who took my order was nice and friendly and didn't rush me at all. He accommodated me without any questions. I had the margarita pizza with extra extra fresh mozzarella. You watch them put all the ingredients on your pizza and then they put it in the over. Pay and grab a seat to wait for your order to come to you. My pizza was deliciously cheesy. Had a great crust to it which wasn't so thick nor thin just the right consistency for me. It had a little too much olive oil but that's ok. I ate it al! The place is kept clean with a worker walking around picking up folks trays and trash. A must try if you like pizza."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place in Atlanta a lot and now they are here in Charlotte!
Their wheat crust is a-mazing! I usually just throw out the edges but this one I savored all the way. Also, their ingredients are fresh. Caramelized onions are my personal favorite.
For those of you with a sweet tooth, their chocolate chip cookies are delicious. They alo have a Coca Cola cake, which looks good, maybe I'll try it one of these days.

They are in the Bank of America building, next to Chic-fil-A and opposite Salsarita's.

PS: If you \"like\" them on Facebook in the shop, you get a 9\" pizza with 3 toppings free."}
{"text":"These days, everyone tries their own spin on pizza, bit this place delivers. It is a subway like style where you pick your dough, sauce and toppings and cook the pizza in front of you. The service is friendly. There is a little bit of a wait because everything is made fresh when you order."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from Maddio's tonight online. The pizzas were hot and ready as I walked through the door, and the staff were great. 5 stars go to the staff, but here I'm commenting mainly on the food.

The pizzas were good, however not great. Toppings were plentiful, but scattered - I really prefer crumbled Italian sausage rather than sliced for one, because you can spread it all over the pie as opposed to sliced, where you may or may not get the sausage in each bite. Same goes for the artichoke. Giant chunks of artichoke were on the pizza, but rather scattered - either you get a giant hunk of artichoke in a bite or you get none at all. This may be all in growing pains, and may be perfected once the newness wears off.

With the plethora of similar \"build your own\" pizza chains entering the Charlotte market, I just wasn't all that impressed when compared to the others. Blaze Pizza is the winner in my book. Not only did I enjoy their pizza more, but they offer unlimited toppings, where you only get 3 without paying extra at Uncle Maddio's. The reason that I give this place three stars is because it's going to be hard to convince me to return here instead of going to Blaze, which essentially is the same type of pizza place, but with a real fired pizza oven rather than a conveyor cooker and more generous toppings that are more evenly spread on the pizza (oh, and there's that spicy marinara at Blaze that is amazing!).

I wouldn't avoid this place by all means, though. Still a good pie - just doesn't quite stack up to the competition IMHO.

Now if only we could score an &pizza location from DC, I'd be in heaven."}
{"text":"I think the biggest thing Uncle Maddio's has going for it also happens to be its biggest downfall: the speed.
I showed up with a few co-workers during the lunch rush, and despite the long line they were very efficient at taking orders and getting everyone through the line. The pizzas were also delivered very quickly to the table, probably after only 5-7 minutes. While I was really impressed by the speed during the lunch hour, I think it definitely affected the quality somewhat. The pizza crust is thin, which I love- if done right, but Maddio's thin crust doesn't hold up to the amount of toppings and you end up with a thin and flimsy piece where your toppings are likely to fall off. I was also disappointed in the amount of cheese they gave me and they were very inconsistent between the amount of sauce and cheese given to me and my co-workers. They also piled the toppings in the middle of the pizza, which provides a few awesome bites that are really cheesy and loaded with toppings and some that are floppy dough and sauce only. The tomato basil sauce was okay but I was definitely happier after topping with some oregano and red pepper flakes to give it a bit of flavor that it lacked. I topped my pizza with jerk chicken, sauteed peppers, and portobello mushrooms. The mushrooms and peppers were what you would expect and were decent, but the \"jerk\" chicken was bland and definitely not as spicy or flavorful as I expected.
I was pretty happy with the service since the workers were nice and were pretty efficient about everything, but the pizza quality just wasn't top notch."}
{"text":"Uncle Maddio's came up as the highest-rated pizza place in Charlotte on Yelp, so I was a bit disappointed to arrive and find out it's a build-your-own-pizza chain. However, I gamely built my own pizza and had an overall pleasant experience.

First off, the staff were incredibly nice and helpful. They really made me feel welcome. The pizza ingredients themselves are a bit generic, but it tasted good. I do appreciate that they have a whole wheat crust, and I added ricotta, spinach, mushrooms, and onions to make a pretty standard pizza. I thought the prices were a bit high for it not being a specialty pizza venue, but overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I love me some pizza! and this place is definitely a go to place for cheap and quick pizza.  I have been here about 5 times and the pizza has never disappointed me! I love this place because you can create your own pizza right in front of you!  They also have and amazing preset specialty menu with a wide variety of styles and tastes. 

The only negative is I tried a panini style chicken salad sandwich, and it was a bit of a disappointment.  I would be cautious of getting their sandwiches but I probably just chose a bad sandwich.  Anyways this place is amazing for pizza, and I will be back very frequently! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Decided to check it out on the recommendation of a colleague. The service was pretty quick and friendly, and the pizza I ordered (the can make one with gluten-free crust) was quite tasty. Hope to try one of their salads next time. Was also nice too when I went to take my plate to the trash, a manager went ahead and did so for me. Great little place (and many steps above the Sbarro that used to be there)."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Fast-casual pizza place is genius. I love being able to create my own pizza right in front of me. Great ingredients and sauce variety. They also have awesome salads! One star taken off because the pizza consistently does takes longer than you think and are told. But... Don't let that prevent you from going, this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner, group of 7. Very good hand made pizzas. We had a build your own pizza. Great variety of toppings . Highly recommended.  Owner and staff are very welcoming. We had a group of seven but had our pizzas made and at our table in about 10 minutes. We came late near closing but owner did not rush us ... Just a great dining experience. .."}
{"text":"I'm honestly surprised to see these good reviews. I picked up a large cheese pizza - simple as can be. It was burnt, and cost almost $18.00! Absurd."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i ended up here by coincidence. We were looking for another pizza place that was supposedly in the same area but couldnt find it. We saw this place from the road and decided to try it. We are so glad we did. I love the whole wheat crust and the smiling staff! We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"For a fast-casual pizza chain, I was pretty pleased with my first experience at Uncle Maddio's.  

The premise is similar to other fast-casual restaurants - you wait in line and select your size, dough, sauce, and toppings.  Then, the pizza is placed on a conveyer that slowly moves your pizza through the oven to cook in about six minutes.  

A 9\" pizza is the smallest individual size (but a smaller kid's pizza is available).  Larger sizes are also available.  For $6.99, your 9\" pizza comes with three toppings.  That's a great value, in my opinion.  The only thing that kind of turned me off is that while employees use gloves when handling your pizza, they don't switch gloves between pizzas.  And they do everything with their hands - spread the dough and cheese, place the ingredients on the dough, etc.  So, if you are a vegetarian, those gloves might have handled meat from a prior customer.   But that probably happens in most pizza places where you can't see them making your pies, right?

My husband loved that he could ask for an extra crispy crust.  We both loved that the pizzas were thin, cooked well throughout, and pretty close to NY style.  And the portion size of the 9\" was perfect for an adult without a huge appetite.  

The atmosphere is kid-friendly, so naturally, it's a bit loud inside.  It was also really cold when we visited, with the A/C cranked very low.  I think we'll stick to the outside patio for future visits, unless the weather is bad.

The staff are very friendly here.  And for only being open for a couple of weeks, they were remarkably efficient.  The manager (owner?) came over to tell me he wasn't happy with how my pizza bubbled up in the oven, so he had them make me another.   Now that's great service!  

Out total bill with two drinks was under $20.  And we left very satisfied.  We'll definitely be making a habit of visiting this place more often!"}
{"text":"Love Uncle Maddio's. I'm so glad I gave it a try a few months ago. I get the Maddio Meal for lunch.. only $8.49 for a great salad (or soup), pizza and a fountain drink! The Greek salad is great and the dressing is homemade.. hard to find! Also.. the customer service has always been great!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I always get the mushroom pesto pizza and add shredded chicken. This is super good. I live their sweet tea also. The staff is always nice and they get your order to you really fast which comes in handy during the lunch rush. My coworkers and I eat here pretty often and we all order different things so that must mean everything's good! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Every pizza at Maddio's is made with love and I believe it. This place is set up like an assembly line. You start with choosing from 3 types of crust, traditional, wheat, or gluten free. Next, sauce is added to your pizza. I always ask for extra sauce because it's very robust. Included in the price of your $7 pizza are three toppings. There are several options and they are fresh vegetables. If you ask for heavy toppings, they generally won't nickel and dime you. Your pizza is then slid in the oven to bake.

While this is happening, you'll be given a number on a plastic circle and told \"Thanks, this was made with love\" by the..... seasoned lady who's been working at Maddio's since it opened. Next, you go to the cashier and pay. Find a seat or a space to stand and your pizza will be brought to you based on the number you're given. 

During prime lunch hours, Maddio's can get very crowded, so be prepared to wait if you're looking for a seat. Never a bad experience here. Always good food. Always good service."}
{"text":"Located uptown in the Overstreet Mall Uncle Maddio's has some pretty decent pizza.  You can pick the first 3 toppings for free and they offer a pretty good number of options.  They throw it into an automated oven that cooks it rather fast so this is a pretty popular spot for the uptown lunch crowd.  Bottom line, the pizza is good and fast. I could do without the corny \"this pizza was cooked with love\" line they give you but other than that no complaints."}
{"text":"Their flatbread sandwiches are AMAZING!! The chicken caprese is the best.  Their ingredients are very fresh and it's an awesome spot for lunch in uptown Charlotte.  I have tried their veggie pizza as well in the gluten free crust and it was great.  Every pie is \"served with love\" for sure."}
{"text":"Tried Maddio's Pizza Joint last week on a whim.  This location was originally an Einstein Bros. Bagel place and I consider Maddio's to be an upgrade.

Maddio's is packed during lunch hours.  I tried their eggplant parmesan panini.  The format of the restaurant is fast casual, workers in front adding ingredients along an assmbly line with an oven behind them.

Pros:

-For baked food like pizzas/paninis, this place is fast.
-Prices are reasonable and the food tasted fresh.
-For such heavy food, there was almost no carb crash or food coma when I returned to the desk.


Cons:
 
-Crowded at lunchtime.  This is to be expected as all the nearby overstreet mall competition are chains like Salsaritas, Mcdonalds, and Chick Fil A."}
{"text":"Service was great. Rashod was friendly and helpful. They have a gluten free menu and real silverware. Loved it."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this new joint in the Bank of America Overstreet Mall. I'd been avoiding it due to long lines and limited lunch time, but took a risk with a friend and I'm glad I did. 

The format allows you to customize your own personal pizza. Their menu offers a variety of pizza suggestions/options with a selection of crusts. I went with the basic white crust, topped with a good tomato sauce, cheese, meatballs, mushrooms and banana peppers. I could have selected from a large variety of toppings. Next time, I'm definitely trying the eggplant - it looked excellent. I was pleasantly surprised to discover their claim of 6 minutes from order to table was accurate. I love thin crust pizzas, and this had a nice, crispy thin crust. 

My friend ordered the chicken salad salad (she'd been there the day before for pizza). The salad was a generous size and had lots of tasty stuff in it. The chicken salad had big chunks of chicken in a nicely herbacious dressing.

I wish they had more seating and the lines were shorter, but I will be back."}
{"text":"The pizza is so delicious. My favorite is their steak and blue cheese pizza with balsamic vinegar. And the staff is always great, tonight the sweetest ladies were working and just made the experience that much better!!"}
{"text":"For a lunch spot, Uncle Maddio's hits the spot.  It is a great place for fast and decent pizza that is made in front of you as you walk down a line selecting your ingredients (think Subway subs ordering process).

Atmosphere - Loud, busy, small...fast casual.

Service - I have been here twice and the service has always been fast and friendly, despite the Uptown lunch rush.  Yes, on one visit I did notice the employees get someone's order wrong and it took some effort to get it resolved...but hey...it wasn't mine...ha!

Food - There are a lot of options here at Maddio's when ordering your custom made personal pizza pie.  

Dough: First, you've got to select your dough.  I have had both the original dough (see pic) and the wheat dough (never tried the Gluten Free).  Based on my experience...get the wheat dough.  The original dough was too chewy and tough (i.e. leathery).  It reminded me of how I feel the crust at Fuel Pizza gets after about 20 minutes out of the oven.  However, the wheat dough at Uncle Maddio's is soft and easy to eat.

Sauce: Both times I chose the Tomato-Basil, which has a nice and noticeable flavor.  I did not need to add anything to make this sauce standout.   

Cheese: Yes, there a few options here too.  But it's pizza...you've got to get the Mozzarella...so I did.

Toppings:  You get to choose three.  The two times I was here I got the same three toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, and banana peppers).  I am happy to the report that the mushrooms at Maddio's are sliced fresh and NOT the watery canned variety...which IMHO are awful.

Price - Personal pizza w/ a drink is about right at $10.  Not too bad for the size of the pie you receive here.

Overall - I have Uncle Maddio's in my lunch rotation...I think you should too."}
{"text":"It is definitely served with love.  I mixed the garlic olive oil with tomato basil and omg!!! The service was friendly. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This was an first and last for us.  We tried to call in our order, it went to voicemail, left a message, never heard back.  Went in to order, service was subpar, we felt hurried through our ordering, even though there wasn't a customer in the place, the cost exceeded the quality by a long shot on everything we ordered.  When we tasted each of our three pies, meatballs and brownie, I just couldn't believe this place could even open a pizza place, let alone pawn this off as pizza! One other note; three days later and my car still wreaks of the smell! We ordered normal toppings like, mushrooms on one and the one they call a Spicey Italian, must be the offensive smelling oder in my car, beware."}
{"text":"This is definitely chain pizza, but actually pretty good. I'm also partial to anywhere that I can order online!!!! Sometimes when I leave work for lunch I'm tied up on the phone and don't want to wait forever to order and have food prepared. This place is perfect for that. It's reasonably priced. The only issue can sometimes be parking. The shopping center is so incredibly busy, especially at lunch time. If you see a spot, take it, because you probably won't get any closer anyway."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best pizzas outside of a mom and pop shop that I have ever had. Perfect crust and great toppings. Friendly service and an amazing chocolate chip cookie for dessert made this an easy 5 stars. Will be back every time I am in town."}
{"text":"New pizza join in town. I walked in with my wife last Sunday, right away the ambiance was very welcoming. Gentlemen preparing our pizza was very helpful in getting our custom pizza ready. This place reminds me of a chipotle for pizza 

And that's a good thing! 

They have different crusts like whole wheat (it's pretty delicious) yet not feeling all that guilty eating it. We ordered a whole wheat pizza with pepperoni, onions and mushrooms  & a white crust with chicken, mushrooms and Italian sausage. Both were delicious but we like the wheat crust more. 

The 9\" inch pizza is perfect size for yourself or to share with someone else. But we ended up eating both of the pizza's. Definitely coming back here soon. You won't be disappointed! Btw, they serve local beer as well"}
{"text":"Drove by and the place appeared to be hoping. So a few days later I placed an online order for pickup. Food was reasonably priced and good. In fact it was so good I ate it two days straight. I will be back."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and their cannoli is very good. The place is clean and the staff is friendly and welcoming. Happy we found this place!"}
{"text":"This review has nothing to do with the food. I am writing this based on an experience I had with the owner on the road in Davidson. Although this has nothing to do with the food and I know this site is based on those reviews, I feel this speaks to the character of the owner and could very well reflect to the type of restaurants he runs. My wife and I encountered this gentleman driving through the town of Davidson. This town is very \"speed controlled\"!  I was driving in front of my wife as I approached one of the many pedestrian cross walks that are controlled by flashing lights and mandated to stop if pedestrians are in the walk. I stopped for the people to cross, as did my wife in her car behind me, the gentleman driving the very large Uncle Maddio's wrapped vehicle, talking on his cell phone came very close to rear ending my wife and proceeded to lay on his horn causing the pedestrians to jump and hurry across the road. I feel if you're a business owner and you're going to advertise the business on your vehicle, you should be much more courteous when driving amongst the potential patrons you're marketing towards. Me, nor any of my family or friends will ever walk in to this establishment!  Congratulations Uncle Maddio, you just earned the worst kind of advertising!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and over the top friendly staff.  My son and I went in between baseball games for him.  He had been hit by a pitch in his elbow and the field had no ice.  When we ordered, we asked if they could provide ice for his arm.  The very friendly worker (wish I could remember her name) went out of her way to figure out how to give us an ice pack.  She ended up putting it in a rubber glove and tied it off - perfect!

As to the pizza, we got a small pepperoni and a small margherita.  They were both fast and delicious.  The crust is fantastic.

Restaurant is very clean.  Another worker was sitting in a booth and started up a very nice conversation with us.  Wish we had one of these closer to our house.  Heck, maybe I will open one! ;-)"}
{"text":"Uncle Maddio's makes a consistently good pizza in a relatively fast time. Even when the line is pretty long it moves fairly quickly. They have a good selection of pre-selected pizzas like BBQ chicken, or you can make your own. 

The staff is consistently friendly. Which is good because you will interact with 3 or 4 staff members as you proceed through the line. 

Another thing I like about Uncle Maddio's is their rewards system. Believe it is buy 10 get 1 free - but don't quote me!  No card is needed as you can use your phone number to look it up at the register (similar to Harris Teeter).

Finally, if you are dining in the store, the decor is fairly modern. And there is a selection of both booth seating and regular tables."}
{"text":"If you want a thin and crispy pizza that tastes good, this is it. Fresh toppings and they make it in front of you. I like NY style but get sick of it so Maddios is my joint to get away from it. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"So, I've eaten here twice and the most recent experience has led to my decision to not go back.  The food is adequate, basically it's the Moe's assembly line concept applied to pizza.  The space is totally cramped and small and the owner is obviously keen on turning the tables quickly.  This leads to my recent experience and decision to not return.

I was eating lunch with a colleague and the Owner or Manager kept hovering over us.  He started by just stepping in and pulling away half of the 2 pushed together tables we were sitting at, to create a 6-top 18\" away.  Then, he continued to hover and stare at us until the we finished eating.  Then, he grabbed our pans and tried to show us out, even though we were still waiting on to-go boxes.

I totally understand the need to maximize your revenue during the busy lunch hour, but in this case, he opened up 1 table faster, but lost 2 repeat customers in the process.  Very short-sighted....."}
{"text":"Great pizza place if you prioritize toppings over crust, as the crust is paper thin and the toppings are abundant. Seriously, it's amazing that the flatbread crust is even able to support the weight of the heaping mountain of meat and veggies. Very customizable too with a lot of options for crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings.

Today I got a custom pizza with wheat crust, garlic olive oil sauce, mozzarella cheese, and grilled chicken, bacon, and pineapple as the toppings. The ingredients taste really fresh and my toppings went well with the garlic olive oil sauce (more so than with the tomato basil that I usually order). 

This place gets really busy at lunch time, but there is a very efficient process that keeps the line moving. Don't be surprised if your pizza lasts for 2 meals."}
{"text":"I was excited to learned that this was a new location for Uncle Maddio's. I have not enjoyed a Santa Fe salad since I worked uptown and was able to walk to the location inside the BOA building. 

The staff are still organizing the flow of orders but I was able to get my order in without any problem. Also, the cashier was super nice and the place was really clean. The Caribbean spot that used to be on the corner of this location is sorely missed, but I gladly welcome good pizza and good salads any day of the week!! 

Definitely a returning customer..."}
{"text":"I give Uncle Maddio's 5 Stars for concept and execution and an A-OK for the pizza for a solid 4 star total. 

The decor is bright and cheerful and the whole assembly line fashion with which they run through the line, have you order and pay is impressive. Everyone I came in contact with through the process was friendly and helpful. 

The pizza itself offers a great variety of toppings, sauces as well as three crust options. There are also plenty of gluten free choices. For me the toppings went from pepperoni (nothing special) to meatballs (good) to (carmelized onions (good to have the choice and they tasted good). The just meh parts were the tomato basil sauce which was much too sweet for my taste buds and the crust which is nice and thin and crispy but lacks that chew that great thin crust should have. 

I also got a side Caesar Salad and while a little small for $2.99, it was good with homemade dressing. All in all, Uncle Maddio's is a decent new lunch option Uptown that should have some staying power."}
