{"text":"Nice, fresh sandwiches and salads along with decent espresso at this MEC adjoined café. Grilled eggplant and goat cheese panini was great, although the tuna and cucumber panini was a bit bland, despite the kalamata olives. $8 per sandwich. If you find yourself at MEC around meal or snack time, don't hesitate to refuel here.

Rating Scale:
1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  
2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one?
3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.
4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible.
5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."}
{"text":"Stopped in at MEC yesterday morning, to have a hiking staff repaired.  Next stop on the day's agenda was going to be Festivague, and I figured I'd better have breakast before spending an afternoon pushing fiberglass.  The sight of Green Cafe at the north end of the store had always filled me with horrifying visions of tofu omelettes garnished with redwood buds and saxifrage, cheerfully served by a do-ragged sasquatch on a fixie.  What I got, once I girded myself and trudged in, was a very tasty roast beef and Swiss cheese panini and a tiny but beautifully-seasoned cold pasta salad, served by a sleek little ballerina on point.

Pretty good start to the day."}
{"text":"Assez cher et bien ordinaire...
Le sandwich était pas pire, mais la quiche était pleine de pâte et insipide.

Je n'y retournerai probablement pas."}
{"text":"Bel endroit, bon café, ambiance relaxe, bon service. Un peu comme un Java moka, J'ai mangé un baba au chocolat, très bien avec le café. Portion très généreuse. A côté du MEC, pas donner mais bien."}
