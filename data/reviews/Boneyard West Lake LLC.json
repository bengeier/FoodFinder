{"text":"Been there a coupla times & every time the food was good. 
The bad things it has going for it are: 1) there are MANY other alternatives that serve the same types of food (american sports bar food)- they're not setting themselves apart 2) beer selection is slim compared to the old Boneyard downtown near gateway. When I think of Boneyard, I think of 'vast beer selection', but you but don't get that here.

The Good things are that the food is good, service is great & personal, and the kids like the TVs & Video game room. We'll go there again, but after we've done the rounds on the other place. If they increased the beer selection to include craft beers/ beers you can't get at similar genre restaurants, we'd prolly go there more often. 

This place seemed dead for a friday night, hopefully its busier on the weekends. I would like to see this place work out."}
{"text":"My first time to the Boneyard ... and won't be busting down any doors to go back.  

The place was rather empty on Tuesday night when we went.  I ordered the grilled porkchops, fries, and coleslaw.  My honey ordered the meatball sub and cajun fries.  We both came to the conclusion that we liked the fries ... regardless of the flavor.  The meatball sub was average.  The pork chops were grilled pretty well and had a good taste, but were really more along the size of a lamb chop.   One bite of the coleslaw and I was done with it.  It was a creamy based slaw with little to no taste.  I would bet we could find a pre-made container from one of the big-box warehouse joints.

Our server was very good and attentive.  She helped with the menu and gave us plenty of time to unwind from work over our beers before ordering.  If I could pair the server with a better food experience, then it would have been a much better visit.

Better luck next time when I try something different ..."}

{"text":"We took the family and friends to the Boneyard last week after my son's game. The staff was prompt and attentive. Two people ordered the cheese soup and sent it back due to the fact that it was way too salty and had the consistency of pudding. I had the ribs, Big Mistake! The ribs were pre-cooked. Then reheated and jar sauce dumped over them.

The food is fair bar food at best. I went to the one in Broadview Heights when it opened and the food was very good. Oh my how far they have fallen. If you go there stick to burgers, fried frozen fish or chicken planks.
I would put money that this place will close within a year. Fix the food fast fellas!"}
{"text":"Went here on New Year's Eve only because our first two choices didn't work out. It was practically empty. The first thing we noticed was that it was pretty cold in there. Either they didn't anticipate enough clientele to be worth heating the place or they figured they'd be so busy the body heat would warm it up. Either way, it was kind of uncomfortable.

My salad and my girlfriend's soup were both good so we got off to a good start food wise. My steak was good, though I was disappointed there weren't any dinner rolls. The baked beans I got looked a little pureed but they were very good. I wanted a baked potato but they didn't have any. I got mashed potatoes instead but didn't like them because they were chunky (kind of like potato salad).

My girlfriend said her steak salad was good, but the breadstick it came with was undercooked to the point it was cold in the middle. The chocolate cake we had for dessert was very good.

The service itself was pretty weak. That would have been understandable if it was very busy but there were only a few other people there so that was disappointing. The bathroom decor was great but it was pretty filthy in there. Again, not sure how that could happen based on the lack of customers.

Overall, it was pretty good and I'll go back but they certainly have opportunities for improvement."}
{"text":"The decor and service were ok but the food (ny strip steak, mashed pot, thai noodles, apple pierogie) was really bad.  Maybe their other items are better but everything we had tonight was pretty bad and definitely not worth the money."}
{"text":"We went because we got a deal on Groupon. The food was nothing special..like a normal American restaurant. A sports bar/grill.

Got fish n' chips plus a combo platter (half ribs and pulled pork). The deal was good for us because of the coupon.

But I was rather disappointed in their \"Game Room\". I was expecting something like Dave and Buster type of game room..but oh man..this game room was literally a 4ft by 3ft room with a few game machines....rather sad.

Probably not going to go back again unless we happen to be there for some reason."}
{"text":"Previously visited a different Bone Yard location and was very pleased.  Unfortunately, they are not all beholden to the same standards evidently.  The first warning sign was that at 4 PM on a Saturday Evening, the place was empty while every place around it was completely packed.  I ordered a Boneyard Burger and fries.  Fries were completely room temp when brought to the table.  The worst, however; came in the form of the Boneyard \"burger\".  The supposedly beef patties were grey and paper thin.  Preformed, frozen patties!  Seriously?  The patties weren't the only things frozen....There seems to be no one in the place willing to turn on the heat.  We never removed our coats the entire time we were there.  The server was pleasant, however."}
{"text":"Purchased a Groupon, wanted to try it mainly because of the location. Went on a friday night, the place was DEAD, except for a few LOUD drunks at the bar. I mean this place should be packed with all the room and TVs. 

Also, it was snowing out and I rarely get cold in places and I was freezing in here. 

How is this place staying in business?

Food was cold, nothing special, pretty sure my veggies were frozen...

Service was subpar

No thanks! Go to Outback next door :)"}
{"text":"This place sets a new standard for disgusting. Dirty interior, dirty bathrooms, slow/absent minded wait staff, horrendous taste in music coming out of a poor quality  sound system...

I just don't know what to say to adequately encapsulate this restaurant. I guess making an analogy would be pretty good. You ever seen any of the National Lampoon's movies? Do you remember \"Cousin Eddie\"? Well if Cousin Eddie opened up a restaurant this is what you would get.

The food they served here should be illegal in the state of Ohio. That pretty much sums it up for me. If you really are in the mood for this kind of food please do yourself a favor and find a BW3 instead. Now you'll have to pardon me while I try to lay down and fight back this nausea."}
{"text":"Ok, so its not the greatest bar in the world, but they have beer and there is never a wait because nobody goes there.  Is that good?"}
