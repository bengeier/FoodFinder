{"text":"Hey The Ramble is The Ramble, family friendly good food, maybe not great but very good, friendly staff priced appropriately perfect place"}
{"text":"Love this place. The people are so nice and know just about everyone on a first name basis. I highly recommend on going on Wednesday's which is wood fired pizza night. The chicken wings are also very good. They are very big and the sauces are unique and tasty. Don't be concerned by the look of the old building when you go there. It's a great place."}
{"text":"I don't think the owners put $0.20 in this place since it's been open but the beer selections good the fish fry is really good on a Friday night in plentiful.the parking lot is stone and not in good shape.the seating area has to be from 60tys along with bathrooms."}
{"text":"First time here last night with some friends.  An OK little bar with average priced drinks.  Bar service was good.  Unfortunately, we wanted to order some food and were told the cook didn't show up for work, so the kitchen wasn't open.  Ended up having a bag of cheese corn for dinner!!  This is what caused me to give it a 2-star rating."}
{"text":"Stopped in for all you can eat wings. Seriously delicious! Fun atmosphere! Our server Alex was friendly and super attentive.  Bill ( one of the owners) was wonderful! Made us feel very welcome! His outstanding sense of humor will bring us back!  This is a hidden neighborhood gem!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times only because of friends who live close by...  Ramble Inn (on the sign)... Mill at Munn (on their website/menu)... not sure what they officially call themselves, but I will call it one thing: not a half step above Greasy Spoon.  This is definitely just the local watering hole for the immediate area - not an establishment one seeks to visit.  Beer promo posters cover busted up walls and crumbling drop ceiling panels, chairs and paper-lined tables like you'd find in an old senior rec center, old TVs cooking away atop refrigerators - all really undercut what they're trying to do (at least according to the \"hidden gem\" references and the menu).  As for the food, burgers we ordered tasted OK but nothing to write home about.  Can't really screw burgers up too much although they were way overpriced for this dive.  $7.95 for their Sicilian Burger (their version of a hot italian sub) w/ fries, $8.45 for their Billy Burger (1/2-lb. burger with grilled mushrooms) w/ fries.  Stayed away from the fancier dinner menu items - way too overpriced for the quality here.  C'mon, $12.95 for a pork tenderloin... $14.95 for a 10-oz ribeye...  $15.95 for a 6-oz Salmon... are you kidding me - at this place?!  Not gonna happen...  Service has consistantly been totally lackluster.  In our last visit there were only 2 tables occupied and 2 guys at the bar and yet the waitress was nowhere to be found.  Service is way, way, way too slow and a bit apathetic when they do manage to find your table.  I could ferment my own beer in the time it takes to get service at this bar!  (And from what I've heard, their slowness is legendary to others who have dined here.)  Not much to worry about skipping this place - there's much better up the road (in all directions)."}
{"text":"This is a place that shouldn't be as good as it is... but it is.  This small, narrow bar is housed in a building that sat idle for nearly 15 years, was condemned by the city, and miraculously saved from the wrecking ball by its new owners. The wait staff(mostly smiling, attractive women of many ages,) is always friendly and typically efficient.  The inside has been smartly rehabbed, with wood paneling, a handful of high tables and a patio out back.  I never visit the patio as it is the refuge of smokers, and hence, no fresh air.    This is a cash only establishment, with an ATM.  WIngs are flavorful, The taco special $1.50 apiece(usually on Wednesday) can not be beat.  If you just want a place to throw down a few, grab a late night meal, this is the place."}
{"text":"When our friend told us to meet her here for her birthday we honestly thought it might be a hotel.   It took 3 of us quite awhile to get our first round of drinks and each time we ordered the price wasn't consistent. The bartenders were painfully slow and seemed angry, but they kind of grew on me as the night went on.  I have to agree with the other yelp review that sitting by the keno machine gets you ignored - definitely sit left.    We asked for a menu a few times, but when she finally was going to bring it she told us the kitchen was closed - thankfully they at least had huge bags of party chips for only $1.25. They also had $1 smokies and people seemed to be liking them :)  The other downside is there is only 1 ladies bathroom and you have to wait around the bar to get in - I hate when it's awkward and you are in someone's personal space (like waiting to use the bathroom on an airplane).   Overall we had a fun night, played some good tunes on the juke box, and accepted the fact the only food we were getting was a party bag mix of spicy chips :)"}
{"text":"Great little bar with great service and prices. Food is awesome. Not a punch palace. Great mix of patrons of different ages."}
{"text":"Love this place! Family owned,  great food and newly remodeled.  Great prices. Reminds me of Cheers. ..everyone knows your name!"}
{"text":"Tried this place again and if I ever return, it won't be for the food.  Besides having no table service, the food most recently was some if the worst I have had.....ever.  it's sad because the area could use a good place to grab a sandwich.  It's obvious they just want to be a shot and beer joint, which is fine.  Due to a limited menu I had a burger.  The burger has been in the freezer too long and the fries it was served with we're hard and cold.  All in all, the place has taken a serious nose dive.  I am not a Yelper basher by any means and I will give credit where credit is due.....just not at the Ramble."}
