{"text":"I've had the burgers their back in 1997, and I can still recall how good it was. 

To be honest I'm not sure its this specific location, but i know was a Licks and it was in Mississauga.

I recall the size of the beef, the size of the bun, the songs they sang while they prepared it. even the nice foil paper that wrapped it.

Loved and still craving it!"}
{"text":"Sun is shining , flip flops are flapping, sunglasses are gleaming, ice cream machines are humming.. what could possibly be missing? A FAT BURGER in the face! with a greasy side of onion rings? 
YESSUMMMM.

I came here for lunch and the first thing that made me sigh sadly out loud was how crappy the \"patio\" was. It was 4 sets of 2 chairs bunch of plastic chairs along the side of the windows. 

The ordering process is strange. They holler out your order to the kitchen??  Yes, because I really want everyone to know that I ordered a cheeseburger, onion rings AND a nature burger . Fantastic. 

The Cheese burger was so so. I really have had better. The bun was horribly old and way too flaky for my liking. The nature burger (veggie) was impressive. Juicy and not as big as the regular beef burger. But still quite savoury. The onion rings were the saddest part. So awful!!!. 
And I was REALLY craving onion rings :( 
They charge a $1.00 extra for mayo on the side. 
THAT'S how you know it's desperate for money. 

Random fact: I think there was some sort of movie shoot going on too. I couldn't stay for long but the scene entailed 2 girls at a bubblegum machine. giggling and sorting through bubblegum balls. They were awful. You could see they weren't into it. Also, her heavy duty eye makeup suggested this could quite possibly be an amateur porno. Who knows. 

Final decision: For a juicy burger to your face and/or onion rings, skip this joint. Try Fulton Burger on Tenth line or South St. Burger on Argentia.

{"text":"Mediocre Ice cream, mediocre burgers, over-priced and meh setting. Overall its a pretty meh experience."}
{"text":"My sister and I came here for a quick dinner before heading home after shopping. Its located in a very quiet strip mall. 

We ordered a burger combo (with fries and a drink) and we upgraded the fries to a poutine. The burger was pretty decent. The poutine was extremely sloppy and kinda salty. It was like a fast food place but Lick's charges almost like a restaurant. I wouldnt say this place is horrible. Its good for a quick meal but I wouldnt come back."}
{"text":"Bland chicken burger. I think I got mild food poisoning, no joke."}
{"text":"The US is just getting the whole poutine thing. So this place was my first exposure to that magnificent, patently Canadian stew of potatoes and gravy. That being said it's just like your first slice of pizza ever. It's flavor will always remain wondrous in the warm corners of your memory, but upon a follow up visit years later and many permutations of poutine later I'm left wondering what I liked about this place. The place is dirty, staff is just trying to get through the day, and the food may have seemed unique in its own time, but that bird has flown.  Those were the days."}
{"text":"Anytime I have a craving for a burger I go to licks. The burgers are so juicy and I love guck sauce! The vanilla coke is perfect to wash it down. I'd give licks 5 stars if it wasn't so damn pricey."}
