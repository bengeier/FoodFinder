{"text":"Went for brunch, very nice.  Good food, nice service, very nice decor inside.

The ricotta pancakes are awesome, and the yogurt with berries are quite nice too."}
{"text":"Good food but waited very long and then they ran out of the lamb for 3 people at our table and told us about it 40 minutes after we ordered. But after I made a joke about the next wine bottle should be on the house, they actually ended up doing it which was very nice of them. Would recommend again but maybe not on Valentine's Day when we went and it was to long of a wait."}
{"text":"Great addition to St Clair W! Been to this location a few times and they haven't missed a beat. Best arancini and gnocchi in town. Awesome service and atmosphere"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night for a friend's birthday, in total we were a party of 15. Usually a big party can be tricky to manage, but I applaud Nodo staff for really taking care of us - food came out in a timely manner, all our requests were promptly attended to...and BEST of all, the food is SO GOOD here!! The mushroom arugula salad was awesome, and the fried calamari..amazing, it's so easy to get that wrong. I was so happy with my pasta - orecchiette with spicy sausage and rapini..so delicious! My friends raved about the pizzas, so I'll have to try that next time! I also like the vibe, it's small and cosy, but trendy and lively at the same time. The staff didn't rush us out even though we were the last one's there and they were getting ready to close. It's that type of service and hospitality that results in customer loyalty. What an awesome night! 

GOOD STUFF: food, atmosphere, central location, no \"added gratuity\" for large group
SERVICE: 2 thumbs up 
BANG FOR YOUR BUCK: great food quality, decent prices for alcohol
RETURN POTENTIAL: will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went to Nodo two weeks ago and sat in the patio. The table was too small for the 4 of us and the bench and chairs were VERY uncomfortable. Our service was fabulous.
The food, shrimp and calamari app and the bruschetta pizza were ok, short rib main ok but turned out to be much too heavy for a spring/summer menu, fish and Cornish hen mains were had by the gents with a outcry of \"Where is the meat\". Sorry not worth a second visit from us."}
{"text":"Third visit to Nodo - second to this location and both times were a 'miss'. The other location just seems to have their flavours down and overall higher level of service and thus, just a better experience.

Were a group of six friends -- all of us visited the other location a few weeks ago but since this location is closer to us, we thought we'd give it a try. Left a lot to be desired in the wake of a fabulous experience at the Junction location.

Bruschetta (6/10) - great dough but totally missed the mark with seasonings
Salad (7/10) - decent but nothing noteworthy
Pasta (4/10) - noodles were mushy and cream sauce had hardened since the pasta came out quite cold
Fish (6/10) - tiny portion and again, lacking seasoning/flavour
Pizza (5/10) - great crust but toppings were not fully cooked through and cheese hadn't melted. Also came out very cold. 

Service was friendly but S-L-O-W.

Overall a miss, which is a shame since we love the other location! There are other great options in the area, but if we're ever craving Nodo we'll be trekking to the Junction and skipping the disappointment at Hillcrest."}
{"text":"We are Nodo regulars!  Food is very tasty, service very attentive and efficient. I love their pastas, the usuals we have are the Pasta Cacio e Pepe, the pappardelle with Ragu, and rigatoni bolognese. All pastas cooked al dente, very very delicious. My favourite dish though is the Carpaccio di manzo along with the grilled octopus. It's family friendly and service is always good."}
{"text":"Accidentally put this in Dundas Street but my review was for Hillcrest:
Firstly, the food was very good.  We had the rice balls and cheese wrapped in eggplant to start and I had the pasta with cauliflower and breadcrumbs.  Very delicious.  The issue we had was with the management and overall service.  We arrived and were told a table of 2 would be ready in 20 minutes.  Not an issue for us so we sat at the bar.  There was only one bartender and he didn't speak to us for 20 minutes when we then ordered a bottle of wine.  An hour later, after watching 3 tables of 4 being seated before us and who had come in after us, we asked about our table.  They said - you are a table of 2 and they are of 4.  Typically, a restaurant would pull apart one of the tables of 4 to seat the table of 2that had been waiting for 90 minutes but not here.  Once we finally were taken to our table, my chair and the floor underneath it were covered in a sticky substance. The hostess said it is only water and wouldn't get a cloth until I took her hand in my to feel the sticky substance all over my hand. I wasn't offered a cloth and went to the washroom to wash my hand.  Came back to pull out my chair to find they hadn't cleaned it all up. They told me don't worry, you wont slip. That wasn't the issue, I didn't want my shoes on top of that sticky mess.  When I went  to pay, I found tomato sauce all over my purse.  It was hanging on my chair as I didn't want it on the sticky mess.  They brought me a cloth to clean it up - never apologized.  When we went to pay they offered a free coffee.  The manager should have come over to us at one point with the 3 issues we had encountered but no-one ever apologized.
So, the food was great but the experience was not and I won't go back"}
{"text":"Went in on a busy night just before Christmas. They kindly found a table for me and a friend despite being packed! We shared the bruschettone to start, and then had pizza and the gnocchi (new school). A very carb heavy dinner but everything was delicious. Fresh, flavourful food. Definitely will go back to try some other dishes!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a weeknight dinner. Typical decor. Food was just ok. Service was ok. They lose a whole 'star' for not turning on the AC on a muggy evening and only opening one small door to the street. We were dying to leave because of the heat.

OLIVE CALDE E NODINI ($8) definitely not worth the price; nodini were tough like stale pretzels. FRITTO MISTO ($15) very salty (and usually I love salty). POLIPO E PATATE ($15) was nice. PAPPARDELLE ($19) was ok. RAPINI ($9) seemed boiled; greyish and stringy. BRUSSELS ($8) were too sweet and dripping with oil. UN PO' E UN PO' (Chef selection cured meats & cheeses for $26) was decent. My partner's drink came in a dirty glass with a fruit fly at the bottom.  Tastiest part of the whole meal was the complimentary herbed flatbread at the very beginning."}
{"text":"Our server completely made the experience for us! Erica could not have made this a better night! We came out to celebrate an exciting day for a friend and she was so lovely. She was attentive, personable and gave great recommendations. We had the best night because of her! Thank you Erica! Oh also, the food, drinks and patio were great too!"}
{"text":"The \" U Chiurito\" pizza will be the reason I return to Nodo. After visiting Sicily last summer, pistachio on pizza was something I constantly came across, so to find this in Toronto was more than I could have ever hoped for!

The texture of the Brussels sprouts along with the cheese, pistachio and arugula pesto make this pizza fresh, meaty (without meat!) and eating every last bite. The warm olives, the burrata, the coccoli - this place does not disappoint.

Service, ambiance, food are all on point at both locations. I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here - it felt a lot like Terroni. The olives and bread knots were very tasty, but I wish there had been more bread knots and fewer olives. The pappardelle was delicious but the new school gnocchi was not my favourite - too dense and heavy from the pan fry. The wine was a standout - we had a stellar bottle of merlot for $35!"}
{"text":"I had the fungi salad and the gorgonzola, caramelized onion, and spicy sausage pizza with eggplant sauce.  They were both to die for and I am not an easy please.  The restaurant is beautiful, my service was great and the food is memorable."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Nodo in well over a year and I'm happy we ended up there again this weekend.  The restaurant does not take reservations so we were nervous that the wait could be long on a Saturday night for a party of 4.  We arrived at 6:35 and were seated right away.  The restaurant was mostly full at this time but it's hard to tell if the wait times picked up later on because we were not seated near the door. 

I love the lupin beans they bring out at the start.  We shared the bread notes (they melted in my mouth and the oil on top was amazing) and the kale slaw salad (the dressing and toasted seeds made the salad).  We were all torn on which items to choose for mains.  I settled on the duck ragu fettuccine. The pasta was so fresh and while the sauce was rich, I did not find it too overpowering.  The food could have come out faster but we were not in a rush and I personally prefer when the meal is drawn out as opposed to feeling like the restaurant is eager to turn tables (especially in a restaurant where they don't take reservations).  I still found the service attentive even though the food took a while to come out.  I also like the atmosphere/decor and felt the price point was fair.  

My two small complaints: the complimentary bread they brought out was totally stale (I was hungry so I still ate it ...).  Secondly, two of our guests were running late (and we were early) so for about 30 minutes it was just 2/4 of us at the table.  We ordered drinks to start while we were waiting for the rest of our party to arrive.  A man, who must have been the manager, abruptly asked us where the rest of our party was.  When I mentioned they were running late and were on their way, he asked exactly when they would be coming.  It felt like he was going to deprive us of our table even though we had ordered drinks ... I understand the objective is to turn tables over and not to delay the ordering process, but after that interaction, he kept pacing near our table to see if they had arrived.  I felt as though if they were so strict about the entire party being present, they should have waited to seat us."}
{"text":"Beautiful space, attentive staff and quality food!

Started with the calamari, and got the duck ragu pappardelle and rigatoni bolognese. Finished off with 2 cappuccinos and a tiramisu to share. Everything was amazing. I also loved that they start you off with salt brined lupini beans and bread"}
{"text":"NODO YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN! 

This is my second time at Nodo but at the newer location in Hillcrest. I definitely prefer this restaurant in comparaison to the one in the Junction because THEY HAVE A PATIO! 
It is also a lot more spacious and isn't as cramped as the original location. 

1) Service: (4/5) in terms of staff, everyone was very friendly and made sure we were being serviced and welcomed. However, BE PATIENT with your food because it was about a 1hr wait for our meals. I believe this was because they really do take their time to perfect their dishes and I guarantee you that you'll taste it! 

2) Setting: (4.5/5) As I mentioned earlier, this is the second and newest Nodo location. That being said, it is definitely a lot more spacious and the backyard patio is very trendy and cute. 

3) Food: (5/5) Never disappointed with the food at Nodo. You can't go wrong with Homemade pasta?!? 

- Gnocchi Old School: I love gnocchi, but I love Nodo's Gnocchi more. I've also tried the New School on their menu and I can honestly say they are completely different but just as good. The Old School has slow cooked lamb which came out perfectly and was nice tender! It's complimented with a red sauce, whereas the New School has white sauce and mushrooms.

- Bruschetta Pizza: I was not expecting it to be as large as it was! Definitely worth your buck. It was light and fresh, not soggy, so you know they did it right! Would recommend it for a group of 3+ to share. 

- Parpadelle: I think that's how you spell it... my boyfriend ordered this the first time and couldn't resist not getting it again. It's served with a red sauce and have a nice flavour with the homemade pasta. He loved it so I'm sure you will too!

Really enjoyed our time at Nodo Hillcrest and will be back shortly! Hopefully try something new, if we don't crave the same thing as before... love it here!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible policy and attitude with respect to seating people - refuse to seat you until your entire party is present, and completely self righteous about it - who needs to pay for the \"holier than thou\", especially in a neighborhood where there are so many other options.   Will never patronize this business."}
{"text":"Fantastic Italian that stands out in a neighbourhood full of Italian restaurants. The pizza is incredible and service is top notch. Place is always packed and they don't take reservations so be prepared that you may have to wait - but it'll be worth it!!"}
{"text":"OMG this place is amazing!!! I'll get my one complaint out of the way and say that the staff seemed very jumpy and anxious, but it was a Saturday night and as someone who works in the service industry, sometimes the stress is high. 

Now onto the good stuff. We got seated right away, despite not having a reservation. The food was delicious!!! And the portions were huge. I had the short rib and I could have easily have only eaten half and been satisfied. A little potato heavy on both my dish and the app, but really lovely experience. The beans and bread are a nice touch!"}
{"text":"The service was really great. It was a busy dinner rush, but the servers were all very attentive and super friendly. The food was delicious! Highly recommend the Polipo e Patate ( grilled octopus and potatoes) and the Involtini De Melanzane (eggplant). The eggplant was so tasty and the tomatoes sauce was phenomenal! So simple but bursting with flavour. Ask for extra bread to dip in the sauce. The octopus was so tender and well cooked. The potatoes under were crispy and had a lemony flavour that complimented the dish so well. I got the oltraggioso pizza - the dough was perfect. Crispy on the outside, so nicely thin and chewy crust. The flavour of the pizza itself was good but add on some of the peperoncino oil, amazing! The pappardelle was also really good. Pasta was perfect, chewy with a nice bite and the sauce was so flavorful. It's a bit of a tight space so when it's busy, it is a bit loud so think more lively restaurant, rather than quiet ambiance."}
{"text":"Really good Italian food (LOVE the rigatoni bolognese) and not too pricey for what it is! Also a really nice atmosphere for any occasion."}
{"text":"NODO. Short for NO DOn't Go. Slow service, salty tasteless risotto, dry meats.  Better italian restaurants literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"Go check out their adorable little back patio! It's the perfect tucked away place to have a drink & some appetizers. The Anno Domini Moscato is absolutely delicious if you're looking for a sweet bubbly white wine. As for food, the bruschetta pizza & arancini are perfect to munch on."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for a friends birthday. Waited 90 minutes for a table of two, we came at 8PM, finally got seated around 930. Resto was super busy which is always a good sign. You could smell the delicious food in the air. Started with the meat and cheese charcuterie app which you can do with out, I've had better. We split the old school gnocchi which was very rich and savoury. Tasty. As well as a regular pizza which was great. Overall the food was good, wasn't the best meal I've ever had. The service was awesome, the bread they bring out at the beginning is tasty and the olive oil is even better. I would return but wouldn't rave about it."}
{"text":"I went to Nodo last night for dinner with my boyfriend, and we were both loved it! 

For apps, we got the lamb skewers, and the bruschetta style pizza thing. The lamb skewers were delicious. The bruschetta was massive and the dough tasted fresh. 

For mains, my boyfriend got the lamb ragu gnocchi, which he loved. He goes pretty crazy for lamb. I got the bolognese. The pasta tasted so fresh, the sauce was amazing, and there was a really good amount of meat in it. I usually eat everything on my plate, but I had to take some home. 

The portions were really generous, and the prices were great. For one beer, a bottle of wine, two apps, and two pastas, it only ended up costing $113. We will definitely be back. 

(my only complaint about this restaurant is that it felt very bright, which didn't' make it feel intimate at all. Maybe dim the lights a little?)"}
{"text":"Decent Italian restaurant that has opened up in the area. Charming decor, good for a date or meet up with friends. It's inline with the other Italian restaurants in this area.

Cocktails: The negroni was off. I don't think they used campari or maybe they messed up the ratio of 1:1:1, gin vermouth campari?

Food: The kale salad was fine, the cheese wasn't really a necessary component. The 'new school' gnocchi was really good.  The pasta dish I had with pecorino romano and bosc pear was just ok, it was way to heavy on the cheese and almost drowning in cheese. Sometimes less is more.

Will go back to try a few of their other dishes."}
{"text":"This is one of our favourite restaurants, serving southern Italian cooking . Comfort food at its best . Thanks to Anthony and the team for always taking care of us ! Please try the bruschetta pizza and the octopus!! Yummy"}
