{"text":"The secret about this place? Amazing tofu. 

It's not on the menu, but they're incredibly flexible and will make any dish with some of their excellent soy goods. I ate here two days in a row on my little visit to vegas (although this partly was due to its proximity to the houses I was canvassing). But it's really good, the thai basil curry and the panang curry, the kung pao tofu, the garlic and vegetables with tofu. Cheap, gracious, hospitable!"}
{"text":"So disappointed!  The General Tao was very good but everything else fell short.  The worst part was the chicken and the shrimp in the noodle and rices dishes were mushy?!  Maybe they were marinating too long before they were added to the stir fry really off putting.  I had high hopes for this place, I think they are trying to be too diverse in their menu.  The free noodles were gross I threw them away.  Don't bother to try any of the Hakka dishes not even close."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST food! So glad it opened up 5 minutes from my house! I love the teriyaki chicken... Comes with rice, delicious veggies, and a huge egg roll! The people there are super nice and the food is cheap, delicious, with good portions. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I was hoping this place lived up to the previous 5 star reviews, but it's not 5 star worthy. 

So I got the spring rolls, egg drop soup, and hibachi chicken entree.

The good: Price. Much cheaper than Amazing Wok! The spring rolls & rice were good. The overall taste of the hibachi chicken was pretty good, but the chicken was dry. 

The bad: dry chicken. Glad I got the extra shrimp sauce. The veggies that come with the hibachi chicken entree were very disappointing. It was about 85 percent onions, which I hate. I did get 3 or 4 broccoli/carrots and 1 zucchini piece and like half a cup of onions. Next time I'd go for the express bowl (no veggis). I also didn't care for the egg drop soup. Not the best egg drop I've had. Probably won't order that again.

The summary: I'm sure I'll go back. I thought it was way better than Hanako."}
{"text":"place was across from cancun resort.

like lala said the lady said the wings were huge..
dude i could've finish all the wings myself

its just like another other chinese food to go places except they had pad thai..i liked it cuz it was for bland than usual..lol"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a while now it is situated at Richview plaza it is pretty easy to find.    The restaurant is your typical small restaurant environment it looks clean compared to other Chinese restaurants I have been too.   
 
   The food is very tasty, I have ordered quite a few different dishes and they where all good. One dish that is really good is spicy squid. The portions are large and we always have left overs.

  Delivery is quick and friendly, food always comes hot , I recommend this place if you want something quick and good."}
{"text":"So, my son and I were driving around trying to figure out what to eat for dinner. I was craving for Chinese, but he wanted chicken. So, we went to Asian Express. They have both Chinese and Thai food. I got their Special Fried Rice and Panang Chicken. As we were waiting for the order, the cashier said she forgot to ask if I wanted some other things. So I got charged a $1 for two little ego rolls (one banana and one veggie). Both of the egg rolls were fantastic. Along with the egg rolls, I got the littlest Chinese container with steam rice. I was sure good with some Teriyaki sauce on it, then finished off. After that, as I was opening the container for the Panang Chicken, it had this unusual smell, but tried it anyways. After a couple of bites, I kinda liked it, but will have to get back to you the details, because I ate Mashed Potatoes and gravy from Popyeyes. My son had chicken and mashed potatoes from Popeyes!!! Overall, I like there food and the service. O by the way, the cashier asked me for the Panang Chicken how spicy do I want it. I was a big chicken and only got 2 stars. Chat with you lata!"}
{"text":"I had the General Tao Chicken Daily Special with rice yesterday it was $6.50 and the food came out fast and the portions were large and was hot... the chicken tasted fresh and the place seemed relatively clean although it was a bit dim... just wish the cashier person was more friendlier.... good trip before visiting the Woodbine Racetracks"}
{"text":"I called in a lunch combo for takeout on a Thursday at 11:30. When I came to pickup, my order was ready but the young girl behind the counter seem to be having trouble multi-tasking ie: ringing me up, answering the phone, making change. You're bound to get that at a new place and with high school kids working so I thought \"no big deal\" until I got home and my combo was missing the eggroll. So check your bag before you leave, at least until they get the kinks worked out. The teriyaki chicken was just ok but I thought it strange that the chicken seemed to be cubes of mostly white breast meat instead of the dark meat most chinese places serve. I will probably wait a few months before I go back since they only recently opened for business."}
{"text":"Great Chinese / Vietnamese / Thai food !!
It's always made fresh !
The staff are friendly & helpful.
They do offer a student lunch special if you walk in & are legitimately  a student"}
{"text":"Very good! Very quick! Great quality for a very affordable price! Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Looks like a little whole in the wall. Great variety of dishes many of them look the same. Courteous staff, fast service, good size portions. Would liked a little more \"heat\" in my dish"}
{"text":"Amazing food, my fav. Chinese...

Amazing service and quick delivery..."}
{"text":"The worst do not order here they WILL PISS YOU OFF I I just called the cuyahoga health department, immigration, and the BBB I'm over these rude disgusting lazy fools"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened, after moving away from Lancaster, SC where I frequented the Japan restaurant.

This is the same (if not better) quality food that you would get at any high-end Hibachi place, but for nearly half the price.

I call in my orders while I am out on lunch break, and they always have it ready for me when I get there 10-15 minutes later, and ALWAYS get my orders right. And the shrimp sauce is TO DIE for.

While I've never sat down to eat inside since my orders are always take-out. there's plenty of seating. 

Definitely check this place out if you are in the area! It never disappoints :)"}
{"text":"We just arrived to vegas and this place was right across from our suite, and just ordered a few dishes to-go.  Ordered garlic wings, pad thai, and larb.  The lady told us their wings were huge and wont find em anywhere else.. haha!  omg, our jaws dropped when we opened the infamous \"giant\" wings.  It's super tiny, more like party wings..and wasnt garlicky but sweet and dry.  Pad thai with shrimp was alright, it needed more pizazz.  Larb was ehh..ok.  The store had like 4 photos of famous people who supposively enjoyed their food, which i think is fake.  

Another one of those vacation spots where u go once and never come back..

bleh."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for about 5 years, their food never fails! My mom especially likes the eggplant with tofu, I am Loyal to their sesame chicken always"}
{"text":"Food is way too saucy.. Sweet and sour chicken balls are chicken less deep frys dough bites with sweet and sour sauce poured over them like a soup when u order the combo with rice your rice is soupy too very salty and gross not worth even giving to the dog.. Chicken wings also soupy and barely any chicken on the bone.. Manage is super rude employees hand bags of food and the manage is calling people bag to the store because they were giving wrong food or extra who wants food that traveled with someone then came back to the store that's not proper or healthy.. Wouldn't even give them a star if I could give no stars that would be my review poor poor service and cheap horrible salty sauced food"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout (Hibachi Beef, Teriyaki Chicken Bowl, and Beef Fried Rice).  I asked for the fried rice to be made without peas (I hate that!) and they happily accommodated.  We tried this place based on a recommendation, and I have to tell you it was excellent!! I was prepared to have over-cooked, dried out meat but it was tender and perfectly seasoned.  The veggies were cooked more than your typical hibachi table-side cooking, but I actually prefer that.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday evening. Not busy at all. I was the only customer in there. This establishment took over the old Pizza Hut I remember going to as a kid. Still looks exactly the same. Even the door handle at the entrance is still in the shape of the Pizza Hut logo. I was hoping to try the buffet but the buffet is only open from 11-3. Asian Express has very friendly service. Food is made fresh to order. I placed an order to go. I tried the orange chicken and fried rice. It was really good and very hot ! Price is very reasonable as well. I would like to come back and try the buffet to experience other food items they offer. Overall, I would definitely recommend Asian Express."}
{"text":"This place is relatively new to this area and it isn't going to last long if my experience is an example of the quality of the food.  We called to order two entrees to be picked up - it was ready when we got there and still hot when we got home.  However, that's as good as it gets.  The rice was tasteless, the egg roll was bland and the shrimp & broccoli I had contained two pieces of broccoli and the shrimp was actually tough and the breading wasn't good either.  My husband ordered the chicken with broccoli and the same problem - two pieces of broccoli and a few pieces of chicken.  We both ended up throwing it in the garbage.  Never, ever again.  I'm predicting this place won't last a year."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here numerous times. I like that I can order online. Honestly I was never crazy for the food but they deliver quick and it's pretty cheap. Ordered the Hibachi chicken and shrimp, steamed dumplings and crab Rangoon's tonight. Everything was delicious!!! The crab Rangoon's actually tasted like crab and not just cream cheese!  The shrimp were large and perfectly cooked!  The chicken had a beautiful golden brown sear on them and I'm honestly impressed!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, if you order from JustEat.ca you cannot receive the free item. Not sure why, it does seem quite unfair. But food is still incredibly good."}
{"text":"Was very, very surprised at this place. Not your typical greasy Canadian chinese establishment. Food was reasonably priced, not too greasy and very tasty. Service was fast, and portion sizes were large.

Would recommend, it's become my go-to place in Etobicoke for my quick Chinese take-out fix."}
{"text":"Great takeout Chinese restaurant. The portions are huge and very reasonably priced, plus they offer coupons for free items when you spend a certain amount which is a nice incentive."}
{"text":"It was fine. They have a nice inside buffet and dining area which I want to try. I will order again from here. Seems clean enough"}
{"text":"I have given this pace 2 tries only because of its proximity to my house.  Once for Chinese and once for hibachi.  The Chinese was sub par as well as the hibachi.  The hibachi meat was not marinated long enough (or at all), but was served with too many onions swimming in liquid.  On the positive if you eat there they give you a huge bottle of shrimp sauce.  

We also went to try the pho but they were out.  The other food we have gotten was so sub par that I am not sure we'll even give the pho a chance."}
{"text":"Asian Express is located in a new strip mall at the very south end of the strip. Under their name it says Chinese/Thai food. 

I went in around 8:45 pm even though they close at 9 and they still took my order.. and they make everything fresh to order for everyone. 

I placed my ordered of Thai barbecue chicken and kung pao chicken and went to CVS in the same lot to pick up some travel sized toothpaste.

Anyway, since the restaurant was closing I took the food back to our hotel room. 

Their \"Thai barbecue chicken\" was extremely dry and flavorless. 
The kung pao was also horrible.. it had too much sauce and way too many bamboo shoots / water chestnuts. I also asked for the dish to be mild-medium, but it was extremely spicy.

The dishes range from $6.99 - $8.99 which is very fair, but the price reflects the quality. 

I wouldn't recommend ordering here. If they re-learn how to make the dishes correct and above-average I think they will be successful since there aren't any Thai-Chinese food places for miles in Las Vegas. 

+ wide variety of dishes
- food isn't authentic"}
{"text":"I've been here before, and it was so much better than what I got today. 

House special lo mein had 2 shrimp, 2 little pieces of chicken, and some kind of beef that didn't even look like it was from a cow. To top it off, when I opened the box since it was to go, this horrible smell came pouring off the noodles. It tasted like it was old. 

The egg roll was alright. The crab rangoons were mostly bread, but they were still kind of good. 

In my opinion, this place is sub par compared to its surrounding asian competitors. The service was nice though."}
{"text":"This place popped up, taking over from where the Mr.Sub was. I was kind of iffy about it like I am with all Asian resturants I try for the first time but we ordered pick up. 
We ordered a bunch of stuff and everything was amazing quality and the food was a really good portion. I ordered extra's(some resturants don't like that) but Asian express was very accomadating. The black pepper beef was something that I will definatly order again. It is spicy but not overwhelming like some other places. The coconut rice is a must as well. I didn't eat a single thing that I wouldn't order again. 
The customer service is so nice. The recipt that was stapled to my bag is actually readable and the girl at the counter went over it for me when i showed up and was very attentive. And the price is really reasonable for the quality and amount of food. 

Im going to be a regular customer!"}
{"text":"Cheap chinese fare, but above average taste. I got the General Tsos lunch special. Rice is what you would expect, simple pea and carrot, but the general tsos was better than average. I was surprised! The price was super resonable at $6.25 i only took off a star because the place itself is a little grimy, and the spring roll was awful. I would have given 5 stars for the genral tsos by itseld though. Definitly coming back"}
{"text":"I always see this place driving by while going to the bank. Finally decided to go in. Order the general tao chicken (came with vegs and steamed white rice) and thai beef ho fun. Everything was really good, a lot better than some asian restaurants. The girl at the counter was very nice and attentive. Fast take out that don't skimp on quality. Was a pleasant surprise. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"LOVE their teriyaki chicken and rice! They are hands-down the best 'quick' Asian joint in the Charlotte area....just wish they were a little closer to CLT"}
{"text":"Tried them for the first time today.
Ordered sweet & sour chicken for carry out.
Got it home and honestly, I've gotten bigger chicken nuggets at McDonalds. The portion was also nothing to write home about. 
On top of that, the chicken did not taste fresh at all.
Oh well, at a tad over $8, it was a cheap experiment and I probably will not return."}
{"text":"This place is less than OK I would give it a 1 1/2. When it first opened, my friends and I would go there after school a lot. The general tao is pretty good, but you realize its mostly fat and batter, and they use dark meat, which is fine I guess. The green curry was less than ok, the chicken is cut really weird, and I baically got only 5 pieces of chicken, and the curry was super watery, also it didnt come with rice or anything so I had to order that after. The chicken balls are alright, but mostly batter and the sweet and sour sauce is alright. In conclution I much prefer Mayflower over this restaurant. I prefer Mayflower's business over this place."}
{"text":"Food is okay but not a place i would visit second time. Service was good and i liked the open kitchen concept. I was hoping the restaurant would be little bigger though. Price is reasonable and there is parking in front of the restaurant. I went there with 2 of my friends. I had Beef Ho Fen, they had Vegetable lo mein and Chili Tofu."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! SO many vegetarian options and the food is VERY good! The customer service is also outstanding! I can't wait to eat their delicious Hot and Sour soup again!"}
