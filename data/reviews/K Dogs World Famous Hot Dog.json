{"text":"This place is great, a little hole in the wall place in a strip mall, but the dogs and sides are REALLY GOOD.  Plus the woman behind the counter was very friendly and helpful with recommendations."}
{"text":"tried a different dog today, can't remember the number but it had bbq sauce , bacon, cheese and hot peppers, sounds strange, but i like to try new things, it was AWESOME!! tried for the first time the potato salad (which is the only thing on the menu they don't make themselves) and it was really good, too."}
{"text":"Hands down the best hot dogs around. I have introduced K Dogs to many people and they have all agreed: there's nothing like this around. Great owner, superb employees that always willing to assist you. Writing is just makes my mouth salivate."}
{"text":"I had a Footlong hotdog with BBQ sauce, Bacon, Cheese Sauce & Hot Pepper relish. It ws Awesome. My friend had a TRUE Chicago dog complete with celery salt, tomato, cucumber & pickle spear.  They make their own Mac & Cheese & then grill it . Can't wait to try more..."}
{"text":"First time visit. Ordered a Shoeless Joe dog (otherwise known as a Carolina dog) and a brat. Both excellent and will be back to try more from the menu."}
{"text":"Took the fam and used a Groupon offer. The deal was four dogs, two small sides (1/2 lb? No way. Mac and cheese was horrible) and rice krispie treats. Value of $35? I can go to Outback for that. Sorry, I was disappointed in food quality and cleanliness."}
