{"text":"Saturday mid morning breakfast, the line wait was interminable. Two registers were open but one was for the buffet only which no one wanted because the was no food left.  We were told that someone might fill it soon. I finally got my order placed and went upstairs with coffee. Two cups later (that I had to return to the main floor to get), the food finally arrives. Very meh. The area is also very noisy. On the plus side, coffee was delicious and staff were all friendly."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. I love getting groceries at Harvest Market, and the food at Farmhouse has been amazing every time.. However, the service can be hit-or-miss, and I find the hybrid cafeteria/server style very confusing.   When I've eaten in, it was unclear to me whether or not I was supposed to get my own beverage, as I wasn't given a cup. I then had to ask the server who brought my food to bring me a drink, creating an extra trip.  Finally, once I was done, I had no idea if I was supposed to clear my own dishes. I try to be courteous when dining, so I felt anxious about not knowing the correct protocol.  Farmhouse, I like you a lot, but your processes are unclear and confusing."}
{"text":"Brunch! Pretty good and fresh, trying to put us on a diet with the wait for new eats, though."}
{"text":"I had the breakfast buffet here with some girl friends. It's about $11 with tax. I liked it just fine and I will definitely be back for breakfast and maybe try having lunch here sometime.   The sausage patties have a good spicy kick to them and the fresh fruit goes fast. The biscuits are really lovely with their butter that they churn in house and the strawberry jam."}
{"text":"Brunch buffet is great value, tasty, and I'd come back for it. The lunch options are decent...to be honest, I just never feel like I'm getting my money's worth for lunch. I could probably make all the lunch menu items myself at home so I won't bother coming here for lunch anymore."}
{"text":"Today is my 3rd time visiting the in store restaurant. The food is ok, but today I was disappointed at my 2/3 full container of 6.00 chicken pot pie soup. I want to love this place especially as a lunch choice but it just isn't stacking up when I have other very similar options with faster service and better value."}
{"text":"I was quite underwhelmed by the food I received here. Went to pick up some meals from the hot trays to go and ended up with something resembling high school lunch food or mediocre hospital food.   I pointed to a display of gourmet mashed potatoes and instead was given a scoop of gooey potato mush from a different tray. I was told I couldn't substitute a side for another entree for extra so settled on subpar mac & cheese. My entree was pineapple teriyaki chicken, which is the only reason this is 2 stars instead of 1. Problem is... it was cold. Not lukewarm. Not room temperature. Not cooled. I'm talking straight out of the fridge. I somehow ended up paying $8 for this combo.   There is a lot more to choose from at Harvest Market, so I'm willing to explore a little more. Never trying anything from this section again. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Really wanted to dislike this place for some reason lol. But honestly, no complaints.  Chicken noodle soup is the best I've ever had outside of my home. (Nothing beats grandmas recipe). None of that msg flavor a lot of places have. No weird ingredients or oddball pasta shapes. Just good classic chicken noodle with egg noodles and herbs. VERY generous with the shredded (the only way to do it) meat, which they claim is free range.  To be fair, the SOME of OTHER SOUPS looked IFFY. But I've just told you about a place that has good chicken noodle... why mess with anything else... smh @ cheese soup. Just stick with the classics and you won't be let down.  Chicken and waffles was very solid. Real maple syrup, fluffy waffles, generous portion of crispy chicken (again, purportedly free range).   Grilled cheese is decadent. Although, I'd prefer an extra slice of Gouda in the middle, the Boursin is an interesting and delicious addition.   Chips were so-so, but house chips never blow my mind anyways.  That's all I've had so far, but I've heard good things about their burgers and wraps.  Service was very prompt and friendly.  All smiles and minimal wait.   The table busing situation is a little unclear. I just left my stuff the times I ate in.  Look... it's a cafe in a grocery.. Among that category, this place excels."}
{"text":"My wife and I had been meaning to check out the restaurant inside the fairly new Harvest Market for quite a while and last night was the night. We got there around 7 and browsed the menu and I decided on a chicken caesar with a bowl of french onion and my wife a garden salad with a bowl of beef vegetable soup. While we waited for our food we browsed the store which has a lot of good looking items in all the heated and refrigerated cases. We probably would have just gotten the salad bar had we seen it before we ordered, but next time perhaps? At any rate for soup and salad we paid a whopping $27+ which shocked me a little but on the other hand I expected it to be overpriced-and hopefully a great tasting fresh meal with it. First of all the service was great, I have no complaints but the salad and soup was just...ok. The french onion came in a huge bowl with what appeared to be white bread with a piece of swiss melted on it on a separate plate? Unusual presentaition but it was ok, Houlihans is better. Secondly my salad came with the dressing on the side which was fine but had very little flavor to it. The side caeser I get at Old Chicago was better tasting than this. My wifes salad was, well, a salad and her beef vegetable \"Soup\" was more like beef stew and too tomatoey which detracted from the beefy flavor. It literally stood in a pile in the center of the dish. Wasn't very pleasing to the eye.  Again, not bad, but for that money we expected much better. Overall i've tried it and i[m willing to look elsewhere for better, less expensive food. I want to like it but perhaps they've spent more time on the marketing of the whole foods-ish type place than actually cranking out great food."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. It often seems to work out that way anyway. Farmhouse Restaurant provides great food but the service isn't quite up to par.   As part of the adjacent Harvest Market, it carries the theme through with farm fresh eggs and other locally sourced products offered on the menu. I've enjoyed breakfast here several times and the food always seems to be fresh and hot and nicely prepared. Omelettes come fluffy with generous portions of meat and other ingredients. American fries and your choice of bread for toast accompanies most of the selections. I haven't tried the buffet that's offered on weekends, but people seem to be enjoying it.  Although it is set up as a cafeteria style venue, the servers who bring out your food are prompt and courteous. My problem is with the counter staff who sometimes are indifferent to customer needs. I often see staff standing around and kibitzing behind the counter. Management needs to keep a better eye what's going on. I waited for 10 minutes for coffee to be replenished on the coffee bar, but that's not acceptable when you have people trying to grab breakfast and get to work or wherever they're going. It's especially annoying as there are separate coffee bar staff dedicated to just the coffee and bakery part of the caf√©.  Then again, where can two people get a restaurant style breakfast  of such high-quality for under $20? You can't really, so despite those lapses I can recommend this joint as a great place to grab a fast, high-quality meal."}
{"text":"Very rude service, overpriced and mediocre food. Won't go back ever. Waited a lot and got disappointed."}
