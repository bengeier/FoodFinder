{"text":"Great food, solid beer selection, friendly staff.  Excellent place to catch a game or grab lunch.  Looking forward to enjoying more good times with friends at Backyards."}
{"text":"Backyards is a great place to watch a game, and the patio area is comfortable and homey, with outdoor sofas and fire-pit areas. The food and drinks are quite good, and the staff are friendly and attentive. I highly recommend checking out Backyards sometime soon; you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed. We order the Your My Boy Blue burger with bacon, Medium. The burger was charred, past well done, and we were unable to eat it. It was also served with no bacon. The wings were ok, sauce was SO mild. Ordered sweet potato tots, got regular tots. Sad part, our receipt was correct, but our order itself was so wrong.  We ordered 3 items and nothing was good and it was way over priced for the quality."}
{"text":"Tried this new place tonight.  Natasha (our server) did a great job explaining what some of the favorite menu items were.  My wife and I had a Mango margarita, roasted red pepper humus, quesadillas, and the special chicken cheese steak.  Everything was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Perfect up north type of bar with great food and good drink prices.  The wings are especially good.  Be sure to have them grilled."}
{"text":"Came here for Grand Opening had the Chicken Tacos and they were excellent, the Green Chili was awesome and the locally brewed Off the Leash beer was EXCELLENT. Great place to come and enjoy sports, patio, and good food!"}
{"text":"So pleasantly surprised to find this place accidentally as we looked for a place to eat. It so happened that the Eagles were playing! This is an Eagles Zone so we really belong. We had chicken wings and tacos. So delicious! There's Tito's handmade vodka being served to try which we didn't try bec we decided to drink our usual blue moon. People are friendly especially the owners and servers. Excellent service. We'll be back another day before going back to the east coast."}
{"text":"Ask for Bueller's wings...best wings in Scottsdale and probably Phoenix...

Servers are friendly and my Moscow Mule's are always on point!

Just finished a chimichanga that was phenomenal because Carlos is a mean Mexican cook!  Love that guy.

Great patio area and can always catch any sporting event.

Backyards definitely doesn't get the recognition it deserves...IMO"}
{"text":"The Good: The location - right off of the 101 highway with easy access, and also convenient to Salt River Fields and Talking Stick Resort. The bartenders are friendly and try to accommodate customer's requests. 
The Bad: Cook can't seem to get orders right. My chicken sandwich barely had any chicken on it - 3 small pieces scattered throughout the sandwich that maybe totaled 2 oz of actual chicken. Additionally, my wife specifically ordered her sandwich dry with no butter and it came with butter on the bread. The bartender was supposed to give a discount on the beer as a Spring Training special and charged full price, then completely dropped the ball on the 2nd beer I requested. Twenty minutes later I decided to forgo the 2nd beer and just tab out. Also, this was on a Sunday afternoon right after a D-Backs home game just around the corner, so this business should have been packed. Unfortunately, it wasn't that busy at all, which makes the poor service even more disappointing and also does not reflect well on the health of the business overall.
The ugly: The owner's demeanor is anything but friendly, and he is dismissive and condescending not only to his staff (witnessed by my wife and me) but also to customers as well. When I was sharing my concerns with him about your service we had received, he cut me off in mid-sentence 3 different times. He also said he was going to have his staff pay for those mistakes, as in, coming out of their paychecks. We didn't agree with that tactic, but he made it clear that it would be a punishment. Maybe he was having a really bad day - maybe it's just his default management style. I understand he has a strong background in finances and this is his first venture of owning a bar/restaurant. Maybe he should stick to finances and hire a bar manager who actually knows how to talk about with people and interact appropriately with his staff and customers. My wife and I wanted to like this place, but we were completely turned off by the owner and we have no intention of returning under his watch."}
{"text":"Just some observations that I hope the powers that be will take note of....... Please change the oil more regularly, I tasted it in my fries. If it happens again I'm gonna call it out. 
The battered fish sandwich --- yeah real cute, I won't be ordering that again. For the same price I can get a full plate of fish n chips from Skeptical Chemyst up the road.
I've already spent a decent amount of money there and I don't need more crap in my life than I've already got. I'm turning on my picky bastard radar as of now. PLEASE, I want you guys to be good, but you need a chef that cares. I'm not a mindless cow."}
{"text":"Great bar with good food! Gluten free option available and the staff are super friendly! The best thing about this place is the friendly staff. Chill vibe as well with 90s music videos playing which is a plus. Eric, Paul, and Stephanie are 5/5 with customer service every time I'm in. Jumbo Jenga was also a success"}
{"text":"What a gem in the desert.   From the help, to the bartenders, to the food, to the owner Eric.  Plenty of tv's to watch your favorite team on. This place is a rising star that you need put on your list to visit. The new patio design is a fantastic place to enjoy food, drinks, and friends."}
{"text":"Hi Eric, 

After visiting Backyards for the second time yesterday, there are some opportunities for improvement I would like to share based on my and other patrons experiences. 

Drink List unavailable at the time of service- Not sure if you have one and the server was unaware or your establishment does not publish one. Either way, having a list of the alcohols available makes the ordering process far easier on the customer and your staff. This has affected my experience in both visits. 

Infrequent bussing of tables- The narrow tables on the patio fill up fast and increase the risk of spills and breaking glasses, especially on the busy football days. We had multiple empty glasses present throughout our stay. 

The beer was served in warm glasses- hot, fresh out of the dishwasher glasses and beer shouldn't mix. (See above for potential contributing cause) 

Wine took 13 minutes to receive from placing the order. 

Based on my experiences, please consider publishing drink lists, continuing to educate your staff on customer service, inventory, and providing adequate resources for high demand days. 

Best wishes for? the new year."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after finding it on Yelp. The decor is modern, updated and clean. 

My group of friends and I unfortunately had an encounter with a really rude waitress named Stephanie....but if you can avoid her you'll be fine! 

We got to enjoy a spring training baseball game on the many TVs that they have- I'm sure they always have the biggest games showing- all while enjoying a cold one and crunchy chicken wings, for half the price of the stadium. WIN-WIN !! 

Check this spot out next time your in the area!"}
{"text":"We stopped in with a group of friends for a quick drink on a motorcycle ride. Our bill was $9. My husband paid with a $20 bill and the bartender decided to tip herself and only gave him back $9. He started to tip her and realized what had happened so asked for the rest of his change. She was a little snippy about it but gave it to him. He tipped her $2 since that's what she decided she was worth but he was irritated. We are always very generous to our servers and bartenders and don't appreciate the dishonesty. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Backyards is a MUST!!! Would never have discovered it had it not been that I was planning a pub crawl with a group of 55 people from our gym (Infinity Fitness AZ)...Met their awesome bartender, Shy, at my nail salon & decided I would come & take a look to see if it would be an ideal place to stop on our route!   Eric, the owner, was extremely helpful in planning the menu for apps to be ready once we got there & making sure we had enough space for our group!  He truly wanted to make this a great event for us & it showed - he went above & beyond!  Everyone in our group was very impressed with the food, the servers (Shy & Natasha) and the restaurant.  THANK YOU ERIC & BACKYARDS!!!  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"It feels like this place is run by a family and friends. Very inviting when you walk in. They are going above and beyond with food quality. The chicken wings were fantastic. They are decent sized and finished on the grill. So good. The sweet potato fries and chicken gouda quesadilla were also really good. 

Our only complaint is that the quesadilla had TONS of onions in it. The menu did not mention onions and my wife is not a huge fan. She definitely would have asked to hold them back if it did. Might be something to clarify on the menu."}
{"text":"First time at the backyard restaurant, very friendly place, Holly and  Stephiane help me . they were excellent on serving me the food was great , I would go back there again . I will tell my friends about this place . Two Thumbs Up !!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! The Chile lime wings were so tasty. Cool atmosphere and seems like it would be a good place to watch sporting events. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Awesome build your own burgers. Recommend the wings as well. Lot of TVs. Dog friendly patio!  I won't write an essay... just go try the food."}
{"text":"Brutal service. Went to watch the cardinals game and they only had the Eagles game on. Apparently it is an eagles bar but we sat down and they brought our menus and took our drink order. We were there for an hour and they never came back to take our food order or to get a second round of drinks. They were quick in bringing me my bill though after I asked for it and that was probably the only good thing.  But for eagles fans it is rowdy so if that's your deal then it's for you. Just know the service blows."}
{"text":"We ate here yesterday for a late lunch with my daughter and her significant other. The place was easy to find, plenty of parking at the time we went, and the atmosphere was pleasant in that they have a beautiful open bar and patio area. 
We started with the artichoke dip which was delicious with the pita bread and we recommend it. My MOAB- Mother of All Brisket sandwiches was absolutely delicious and just that flavor and tenderness would be enough to make me come back. My daughter had the Adult Mac and Cheese which on the menu and the review on the website looked great however it was a bit dry, it needed more creaminess. Her sig other had the chicken salad sandwich which he gave a solid 4. The waitress was attentive and the food came out of the kitchen at a reasonable time. If I was in the mood for a great brisket sandwich, I would definitely come here or if I was  pre or post spring training game this would be an excellent place to come to have a drink and some good food."}
{"text":"Backyard's is a very cool place to hang out at. The bar staff is friendly and personable and the owner, Chris, provided great service as well. Their chili lime wings are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! You can order make  your own salad and make your own burger with quality ingredients!! Staff is really friendly! We are fans!"}
{"text":"Sunday football is here, and this is a great place to watch the games.  TV's showing all of the games, really good food and great drinks.  Amber made a fantastic spicy bloody mary! Go Cardinals! :)"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite bars in the valley!  I've been coming here to watch football games with the family and it seems like each week there is something improved.  Pretty sure the patio has brand new televisions along with new tables and chairs.  We've always enjoyed the food and the owner is friendly and accommodating to any requests for games we'd like to watch.  Tons of televisions so getting a good seat has never been a problem.

I've written one review on this bar in the past but I feel likes it's only fair to update every once in a while, especially when things are only getting better.

I 100% recommend checking this place out.  Pricing is reasonable and love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Super good food. I had the brisket it was so tender and full of flavor. My boyfriend got a meatball sub and it was super good as well. We took our daughter who is 5 and she enjoyed herself. Great place to eat friendly environment. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I should've listened to the person that said the service was terrible. Walked out after ordering a beer that never came after 10 mins and waiting for her to finish looking at her phone.

Adding to the comment below. 
That is incorrect. I ordered a beer, unfortunately it never came. If your waiting for 10mins plus, that's unacceptable. Rather than lying completely it would best serve you next time to just say \"give us another try, our mistake\". What you've done now is create a maybe return costumer into a for sure never return customer now."}
{"text":"Service is great. All the bartenders are friendly and get to know you really quick. Recommend the chili lime wings (ask for grilled and extra sauce on the side) as well as the adult Mac and cheese. The patio is a nice touch and it's also been redone since it was kimmyz. Lots of tvs, they don't have a jukebox but the music choice they play works great. If you get Deana, joke around with her. She's got nine toes and sharp as a tack."}
{"text":"this bar and grill is amazing. service and food are fantastic. I enjoy sitting outside and having a drink and watching TV. patio is per friendly which I love as well."}
{"text":"So disappointing. This was our second and last visit.  The staff is really friendly, nice beer selection the food looks good. The issue is they allow smoking on the patio. Apparently they have many regulars who smoke. We don't and won't return to offended by cigar and cigarette smoke so close to the out door bar. 

Bummer."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here for a bite to eat, before the ASU game.  Nice sports bar, great food, great service! Shy, our bartender was terrific."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and drink!!!  Close to freeway, every game, excellent draft beer selection!

I got this green chili burger...totally unexpected, but
amazing!!  Order with tots or onion rings!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Chicken salad sandwich had a lot of mayo. Service was awful. Took forever to get service, then drinks and drink was still wrong. Never received a water after asking 3 different times. Don't recommend."}
{"text":"Brought the family to this establishment after an enjoyable morning at the OdySea. Wasn't sure what to expect but incredibly pleased with the outcome. Orders ranged from Smoked Gouda Chicken Quesadilla to the 'You're My Boy Blue' burger to the BYOBurgers to the Grilled Chicken Salad. The quesadilla was unique with a Smokey flavor that evoked memories of happier days gone by. The onion rings were deemed 'the best onion rings ever!' by one of our companions and they were right!  The YMBB burger was unreal. The blend of blue cheese in the burger combined perfectly with the juices released from the burger when my teeth initiated each bite. A strong fry game with excellent cole slaw capped off a wonderful meal. 

The service was great with only a slight delay amongst the various items."}
{"text":"Amazing. My first visit tonight to this newly renovated Sports Bar. I have been in Scottsdale for 35 years. Some good Sports Bars come and go and I am always looking for something \"Really Good\". This is it, I think it is the best Sports Bar in the entire Valley. Rob"}
{"text":"Great after work hangout.  Drinks are good,  service is friendly and food is way better than expected.  
Enjoy the outside patio while you can, the weather is perfect for it right now.
Live music is a bonus,  every performance has been a good one."}
{"text":"I've gone to this place regularly since the (re)opening. This is a great B&G in a great location! The new menu is fantastic, I highly recommend the chef salad and the smoked chicken club. The burgers are true Scottsdale worthy. THE BEER IS COLD ALL THE TIME!!! If you're a Philadelphia Eagles fan (not it) you'll love this place as the local Eagles boosters are hosted here. Really dedicated owners and friendly staff. Tell Eric and Chris that Don Julio says high and you'd like the JimmyJohn rate LOL!"}
{"text":"We finally made it to Backyards Saturday evening after wanting to try it for a few weeks (had a Groupon+ deal). All I can say is Ehh.  We were the only people in the restaurant (there were a couple of groups bearing the heat on the patio) which is never a good sign. The first  two tables we went to were not wiped down, the bartender/server was so-so at best and the food was overpriced for the mediocre quality. There are too many similar offering in the area (Goldies, Tavern Grille) that have better service and food - our first time here will be our last. And somehow I don't think they'll care.

Follow Up Reply:
Eric - 
My 'never a good sign' comment was referencing the lack of patrons IN the restaurant, not those on the patio. And there was nothing specific that would have prompted us to ask to speak to a manager ... just a server that chose to not engage in small talk, a Costco-esque black bean burger with a limp piece of lettuce and the overall 'lack of experience' lead to my Ehh summation. I expected more for my $60 investment. Maybe a proactive approach of table surfing to chat with your customers would lend on the spot insight and offer opportunities for improvement. I wish you the best of success in your venture. The concept appealed to me but the reality didn't."}
{"text":"Thought I'd pop in for lunch. Food sounded good from the menu that I looked at online. Full bar but otherwise not busy. No one acknowledged me. So much so that when they asked, what seemed to be a regular, if he needed a refill, he said yes and offered to get me one since they haven't even recognized my existence. I said no, thank you and got up to leave. Not one employee said a word to me. Would have been nice to try, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was great with a good beer selection but service was TERRIBLE... After walking in and sitting down at a table it took about 10 minutes for a bar back to come over and bring water and we asked if we could order with him but he said no but he would try to find a server to send over.. 15 minutes later the table next to us who sat down just after we did asked if there were actually anyone working here I said I didn't know because I hadn't seen a server yet so they went up to the bar to order drinks.
Eventually the server came over, we ordered dinner and drinks, she then came over once to drop off the drinks and that was the only time we saw her until I went and found her to get the check (someone else dropped off the food)

Like I said the food and beer selection were great and so was the atmosphere so I hope they get their stuff together because I would like for this place to last."}
{"text":"A new favorite spot, thanks to previous reviews we stumbled in on a Sunday night. We were the only diners however we didn't let that deter us. Great wings (grilled with chili/lime)salad and sweet potato fries. Hubby had pork tacos, and honey bbq wings. All was really good. It was too hot to sit on the patio however they have misters, so we will try it next time. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had the brisket sandwich and it was fantastic. Great service reasonable prices. I think we finally have a winner at this location. Give them a shot and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came back a second time--the fries are just as good! So much so that we ordered a second side of them just because. This place is awesome! It's a smaller bar so it's more intimate and everyone working there remembered us even though we'd only been once before. Great service, everyone is super friendly. It's clean and well kept!"}
{"text":"So this is the old Kimmy Zs. Which we all knew w wasn't the best. I heard she sold it so I thought I'd try it out. 

Was greeted by a very nice bartender Amber. That was a first great thing as the grumpy bartender that Kimmyhad was a reason I stopped coming.  She was very personable and asked what your name was. Nice touch. The food was good although limited   The big difference is the service and friendly atmosphere. So everyone. Let's give them a  shot.  It's a nice bar to relax and enjoy a dinner and drink. I'm a fan of local places.  So far a great first impression.

Michael"}
{"text":"Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Steve Jobs, Backyards... what do all these have in common? They are the Best at what they do and Backyards is the spot to be these days. Get the wings and make sure you have at least 10 beers."}
{"text":"Stopped by after seeing a post on Facebook.   Sort of a weird vibe.  Great live music and dog friendly patio.   But then people are smoking on the patio and the bar staff sort of has a toned down Dirty Dog look thing going.    But then they have some sort of cute dog photo booth and families start showing up for dinner.    So it is a patio sports lounge to hang with family and friends or is it a just another bar?   Hard to say at this point...it's a pretty friendly place and I'll likely check it out again."}
{"text":"Backyards is bomb!  Service is great and the special is always worth checking out.  Tell Stephanie hi for me!"}
{"text":"First time here!!  Certainly not my last though amazing atmosphere and he staff was amazing.  Made my night and dinner perfect I can wait to come back and see Stephanie!!  Take my word for it go visit and ask for Stephanie!!"}
{"text":"Is it the best food, no, but it's pretty good.  I am giving this place 5 starts because I was so impressed by how they handled the crowd for the Eagles playoffs.  They kept bringing us in and their service was great for such a large crowd.  The food came out hot and cooked correctly and their wings are as good as everyone says.  Great local bar and looking forward to going back many times in the future!"}
{"text":"Wow! Great food and friendly staff. We had the Ruben and a Green Chili Burger (open-faced) along with sweet potato tots. Yummy! The beer selection was pretty good (some locals), but make sure to ask what else they have. Multiple beers were not listed on the menu.
 The only reason for 4 stars is because the doors were open to the patio where multiple people were smoking both cigarettes and cigars, the smoke was flowing into the building. Gross! Also it's still a little to hot out and the doors were letting in a ton of heat.
If there was no smoke it would be 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great local pub. Food was excellent (I had the Reuben with sweet potato tots).   Bar tenders make the place  5 star.  I'm from out of town and felt welcome immediately and had great conversation with bartenders and regulars. Paul and both Stephanie's made for a great afternoon."}
{"text":"In town for business, and 2 of the 3 nights, I had the pleasure of coming to Backyards for dinner.  I really don't get the reviews about poor service or the owner's lackluster attitude.  I didn't experience any of that.  Often, I've found that the problems don't exist with the business; they exist with the customer.  Such are some of the negative reviews here.  

Both nights, I experienced a different crew.  Night 1, I was served by Bueller and Natasha.  Both were friendly, chatty, and made me feel very welcome.  Night 2 was Stephanie and Holly, and again, homerun on the service.  Eric, the owner, was also there both nights.  And both nights, he was engaged with his customers as well as his employees. 

The food is exactly what you would expect at an establishment such as Backyards.  It isn't 5-star Michelin quality.  But it also isn't dive bar-esque.  I had the turkey burger the first night, and it was a solid burger.  Seasoned well, cooked well, plated well.  I wasn't too hungry the 2nd night, so I decided on the bar food staple: the wings.  And I was not disappointed with the Chile lime sauce.

To the folks at Backyards, thank you for making my time in Scottsdale memorable.  And to all 4 of my servers, great job on the old fashioned!"}
{"text":"Would have been a 4.5 but the bartender, Patty, made our day. The food is good. Wings are excellent. Try the nachos. They looked good when the guy next to me devoured the entire plate by himself. Check it out."}
{"text":"Nice small sports bar, near the 101 & Salt River fields. Wings are$1ea. Bar tender is terrific. I will be back but nothing to race about."}
{"text":"AWESOME PLACE!! From the wings the size of your fist to the out of this world burgers - you will not be disappointed with anything on the menu! I received a lot of thumbs up when I asked the group on their selections - quesadillas, brisket sandwiches, and BYOB - Build Your Own Burger! They even have their own draft beer - a mandarin witbier served with an orange. Good stuff!

Being from out of town and unfamiliar with the valley, I lucked into this from previous Yelp reviews and was so pleased with my decision (especially since the bosses were part of the group!). Owner Eric and his team, led by Samantha, took care of our loud and large group of out-of-towners. TVs in every direction and a patio with a mix of tables and high-tops come together to make Backyards a comfortable bar and grill I'd be comfortable bringing my family to or to have a date night with the hubby. 

Food - great! Service - outstanding! If you live in the area, I highly recommend making Backyards your new go-to place!"}
{"text":"Great spot to go before/after the spring training games. Very close to the fields. Good beers and food. Started with the fried pickles which was a pretty good portion that was shared amongst a few of us. I then had the tacos with the green chili and might I say the green chili was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Love the service here. I've been working down the street for four+ years and have seen three other owners before Eric. 
The first owner under Ventura grill made a decent hang out spot after work. I loved that it was close, so I kept going. The next owner, Aiden, made my friend and myself uncomfortable when he forced himself onto my friend and closed down early to offer us free drinks. 
Literally stayed far away from this place until I saw \"Kimmys\" opened. It was back to the OG Ventura days where it was a casual HH spot to drink, which was great. But I felt more motivated to drive to Zips instead due to the parable experience of the servers. 
That changed when Backyard's took over. Immediately I loved the music, because that's what I noticed first. Then I noticed how personable the servers were. After two times of attending, the servers made a point to bring my favorite drink. I noticed how customers were comfortable because we stayed for hours. Lastly, but not least, I met Eric. He's the kind of guy that you could talk to after work, a friendly face. He's down to earth along with his friendly staff who always makes sure to accommodate your every need. They are there to be there for your experience and it's obvious. Thanks guys, for moving in. This is my spot, and it's because of you."}
{"text":"Yes, I am a fan of Backyards after only one visit.  My wife and I went there because of a Groupon+ deal (20% cash back on your first visit).  Frankly, because of my experience with Groupon restaurant deals, I was expecting \"only OK.\"  What we got was really excellent.  My wife ordered the chicken salad sandwich.  What she received was, as she described it, \"the best chicken salad I've ever tasted,\" on a croissant.  She chose tater tots as her side.  I ordered the brisket sandwich.  The brisket was good.  The barbecue sauce was the best this side of Kansas City.  I ordered onion rings as my side (I was upcharged $1.00 for the rings - don't remember seeing that on the list of sides on the menu) and they were amazing.  Hot, crispy, not greasy.  Just wonderful.  As Backyards is just a bit over a mile from my house, I will be back many, many times.  Can't wait to try their breakfasts - that menu looks wonderful."}
{"text":"A must try! Amazing wings and the brisket sandwich with sweet potato tots are seriously yummy! Great drinks and patio gives an awesome atmosphere!  Definitely coming back for more great food and drinks! The owner is a great guy and SUPER friendly!"}
{"text":"If only the service could live up to the food!  Horrible service, think the bartenders have blinders on and are oblivious to an empty glass and eye contact!    Wish it would of been a better experience."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly. She offered us country fried steak off the special menu and it was delicious"}
{"text":"I was looking for a spot to hang out and bring my dog, and I found way more. I was lucky enough to stop by on evening when the management stuff was in and they were insanely welcoming and cool. In fact, all of the staff was fun and they all made my dog feel as welcome as I did. I had the chef's salad and brisket sandwich which were both delicious and reasonably priced. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxed environment to hang out, watch the games, catch up friends, or pet some pups."}
{"text":"Wings are good. Pours are generous, but Asia is why I will come back. Cool neighborhood vibe and Asia was rad. She is attentive even during the busiest hours and it is obvious she is passionate about her craft."}
{"text":"Holly was amazing!! Food is great. We had the mixture appetizer platter and some drinks. Staff was friendly and accommodating. The patio has awesome misters that keep it nice and cool and my husband enjoyed watching the golf match in the patio TV's."}
{"text":"Walked into the patio Entrance and decided to stay for lunch and a beer.. Glad I did, and will be back again.. 

Sweet Potato fries were ok, not as \"homemade\" as I like from other places, but it cured that craving.. Was feeling on healthy side so got the Smoked Chicken Club Diablo Style... Now DAYUM thats a tasty sammich and well prepared, decent thickness of Bacon.. WOW,,, and walking distance from work... oops, did i say Beer ? I meant beverage.. lol

Yes, will be back there more !!"}
{"text":"Ok , stumbled across this place ! Love love ! Food is top notch ! And they allow dogs on the patio ! 
Ashley  rocks !  I am a foodie ! ! I know what I am taking about !"}
{"text":"Only deducting one star because of a rude encounter with the bartender named Stephanie. Other than that our experience was great. Great atmosphere and easy parking ! The wings were good and a very good price ! Very long bar to sit a long and also noticed a patio area even though we did choose to sit inside. Many TVs with all types of games to choose from. Also, very clean restroom which is a plus"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite hangout!!! The service is friendly comfortable and prices are very reasonable... Eric, the owner is professional yet down to earth...the staff as a whole are so welcoming... come check it out!!! It's totally a place where my bff come n feel like we are in our backyard"}
{"text":"As stated by another reviewer, not too sad that Kimmy'z is gone. (their help was not to helpful).  I went to Backyards last week and they are still getting their ducks in a row.  Still developing full menu & Happy Hour specials......I hope they run HH until 7:00pm.  They could grab a lot of business if they could just get people IN THE DOOR.  The ladies working the bar/floor are a great improvement !!"}
{"text":"The patio here is great, but the food and service is less than desirable! The pizza is a basically a microwaved lean cuisine. The servers never came around and was constantly outside smoking. Upon return they didn't even wash their hands. Good place for drinks, but pass on the food!"}
{"text":"Great place. The Green Monster Burger was delicious! Can't wait to try more. Service was excellent as well."}
