{"text":"The food was ok, we ordered dinners but got ala carte, I don't think the waiter spoke English, it was just ok, the place needs a good cleaning."}
{"text":"The food is so delicious and makes my belly extremely happy! The flavor is literally like a punch in the mouth. The desserts are also awesome and fun to pick out: )  the chicken tikka masala is my favorite. And this is my favorite place to get the masala!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  So happy to have a solid grocery store and chaat place in Central Phoenix.  Good chaat, mithai (sweets), and other delights.  Usually fresh jalebis too :).  For Diwali they had really nice milk sweet mithais that tasted homemade to me.  The thalis are great; especially the chicken tikka one.   I haven't tried the pizza, but it sounds good.  The vegetarian thali/meal selection is decent but not quite as good as Little India.  The grocery store is small but they have the necessities: spices, dhals, rice, attas, frozen foods, namkeens, Indian beauty supplies, etc.  The folks who work here are nice and helpful in finding grocery items.  Best part: when I was there today I saw some buffet equipment and when I inquired I was told they are going to open a full restaurant in the back!  Woo hoo can't wait!!!"}
{"text":"Was here for a buffet, using my Groupon and I got excellent food! They let me use the Groupon for their delicious lunch buffet that offered both vegetarian and non-vegetarian choices.  The garlic nan is huge and so good I had to buy extra to take home. The attendant was helpful and friendly.  I will definitely come back, Groupon or no Groupon!"}
{"text":"This was a lovely find for a nice dinner after an acupuncture treatment across the street at PCA. I enjoyed a thali dinner with butter chicken, rice, pickles (mmm, my spicy favorite), veggies and dessert of gulab jamunfor about $10. I had enough for leftovers the next day. The service was pleasant and I took a lap through the market to purchase some snacks before paying my tab. There was a healthy line at the cash register of folks buying all sorts of different goodies, sharing stories/swapping recipes. I definiitely sensed a community vibe here and that made my experience all that much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"You've gotta be fucking kidding me?! Who's been reviewing this place? Weird, weird, weird. Our waitress (Gollum) who I found with her fingers in her mouth had less charisma than the dirty cutlery on our table. It's hard to enjoy food once you've seen that but the place was also completely empty, void of an atmosphere and the food which was served on some sort of jailhouse metal food tray was of a piss poor standard. I found a hair on my plate too which I can only assume came from Gollums beard.

If I could give this place no stars I would. The only redeeming feature was the parking space right in front of the exit which will help when you want to get the hell home to take a bath. Don't eat here unless you truly hate yourself.

Edit: Since my harsh but very frank review I have had pretty shitty direct messages from some pussy at this fine dining establishment. Worse place i've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. The food is delicious and very affordable. The food does not come out fast, but it is well worth it!! I almost didn't want to write a review for selfish reasons, but I would also be very sad if this place didn't stick around for lack of support. This cafe/market is a Coronado 7th st GEM!!"}
{"text":"I am generally not much fond of writing reviews. I recently moved to phoenix after staying in Omaha, NE for about an year. Went for the grocery shopping and seeing a restaurant right by the side, decided to have my dinner too as I hardly had energy to cook it myself. 
Well, you can imagine that the food impressed me that much that I HAD to open my laptop and write this review. when I say food was the best, I compare their food with the various Indian restaurants I tried while at Omaha. This was as authentic and close to Punjabi flavour as it can get in my understanding in a foreign land.
While I agree with Chelsea W, the owner and staff are not as professional, but I believe, its not rudeness or any color/race differentiation as she suggested, but this is because they are very normal indian people who are shy and not absorbed into the American mannerism yet. That's in fact another thing which made e feel home.
I would be going there more frequently!"}
{"text":"Buffet is the best. We used to order out for dinner all the time, but now we enjoy the buffet so much we almost only go for lunch.
Try the bakery items in the little store. Ask someone who looks like they know what they are talking about to explain what they all are. I like the little cashew diamonds!
We have even purchased the music videos from here after being so entertained during dinner and lunch!"}
{"text":"The service is outstanding .!!! They were helpful, & informative with my questions on spices. The food.. Perfection. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? Who cares - let's just get down to the basics.

GOOD food. FULL of flavor. 

CLEAN.

CHEAP.

Garlic naan, mmmmm. 

Thali dinner you can nicely split with three people (or have it all to yourself, piggies, lol).

Awesome grocery, too. Try that basil toothpaste and freshen yo stanky breath."}
{"text":"Irritated.  Despite what both Yelp and their website state, the restaurant is not open between the hours of 3 & 5 p.m.."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  VERY flavorful, great variety, quite inexpensive.  Perhaps the third best India food we've had, at any price.  Don't be put off by the decor, which is thoroughly strip mall-y, thrift shop-y, and makeshift (the dining room is around back of the grocery).  The  food arrived quickly and the staff was responsive.  (It was 7pm on a Tuesday, with fewer than 10 other customers, all Indian-American.)  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love the buffet.  I'm a lover of their butter chicken.  Took my coworkers here and they are from India.  Their response was-  ok food reasonably priced.  I go for the butter chicken.  They could make the buffet filled with food because they seem to run out of food really quick here.  Love their Indian market..."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place when my go-to Indian restaurant was closed, and I couldn't be happier I found this place! Seriously tasty, and a huge amount of food."}
{"text":"This will be my go-to place for Indian in central Phoenix. I am pleasantly delighted with the flavors and textures- the chicken in the butter chicken is tender and the samosa's outer shell is firm yet flaky to hold the mildly spiced vegetables, namely potatoes and peas. I have identified that one of my guilty pleasures in the carb family is garlic naan. Man, it's good here. The dining room is bright and colorful- it backs up to the classy Bandaids club. I suppose it adds to the \"exotic ness\" of the experience. All in all, I would love to come back and try ordering off the menu. The buffet is $8.99 on weekends and I got to try lots of wonderful things."}
{"text":"Today was my first  visit I took my food to go It was excellent. i had samosas  it was the best in town I will go back for a sit down  dinner."}
{"text":"I stopped in by chance and glad that I did. The Indian buffet was very good and fresh. The only thing I would change is to increase the heat level a bit. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really good food. Order off the menu. The service was lacking, but the price was right. I'd recommend it to anyone who like Indian food."}
{"text":"We came here on the recommendation of Chow Bella, Phoenix New Times food blog. The review had raved about their menu and some of the classic Punjabi fare on the menu.

We walked in and there was a buffet on for lunch. I usually don't do buffets, but we wanted to try the food, so we decided to stay. 

It was a really weird experience. There were five or six open tables (probably 12-15 tables in the whole dining room), but the one waiter seemed really slammed. It took him 10 minutes to get our water, and longer to get our naan (which we didn't even know was coming). Additionally, continuing with the apparent crush the kitchen was experiencing, the buffet was out of food at noon. For instance, there were only two, cold samosas when we arrived. My wife got the last piece of butter chicken. You had to fish in the soupy, runny sauces in most of the curries for any of the contents. They were out of rice.

We worked on our plates for 20-30 minutes or so. During that time, they brought out two bowls of pakoras.  They also took away the tray of butter chicken, but never restocked it. Everything we ate was cold (except for the few hot pakoras we managed to get). Eventually one of the customers cornered the waiter and they brought out some hot samosas, because there was literally no warm food out.

Overall, the food was okay. My wife said that the single bite of butter chicken that she was lucky to get was tasty. I thought the aloo gobi and the peas with paneer were okay, but I make better at home (also, the aloo gobi had very little cauliflower and the peas were canned). Do I feel like I got my $8 worth? Yeah, I suppose (I wasn't hungry afterwards; I also wasn't happy, however). But paying $8 for all-you-can-eat Indian food should probably give all of us pause. Given that the food had been sitting for a while, and was probably not particularly good quality to begin with, I honestly spent most of the following afternoon thinking \"I'm really glad I didn't get food poisoning at lunch,\" which is probably the best thing I can say about New India Bazaar."}
{"text":"Try the samosa...  these are really good!  We got the chicken tikka, and lamb korma meals... both were fantastic.  Definitely a great place that won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I found this place when I was looking for shisha at the new smoke shop across the parking lot. I went in and checked it out.

There is a small lunch counter inside this grocery store and I tried an aloo gobi to go, potato and cauliflower with rice and naan. It took awhile to be prepared but not too long. It cost $6.55 and tasted very homemade. It was also way more spicy than I expected but I loved that. I had forgotten to request a spiciness level and it was intense in just the right way.

Credit card payments have to be a minimum of $10 or they charge you 35 cents. Seems fair to me.

I'm going to go back there next week and try the desi pizza or something with chicken in it. They have some Indian wrap things, masala, korma and what looked to be some common Indian dishes like samosas, etc. The prices are affordable and it was fun to wander around and look at the stuff on the store shelves. There are lots of prepackaged Indian dishes that I think I'll try. They all cost between $2.50 and $3.50 and look very authentic."}
{"text":"Good variety, and very high quality food. I come by for the all-you-can-eat buffet just about every weekend and I am in love with the Chicken Tikki Masala. Good selection of imported ingredients from India in the store next to the restaurant shows that these people know their stuff!"}
{"text":"Some of the stuff is good, but i'll never go back because it's run by arrrse holes, led by the head arrrse hole, the owner. Some of their low lights:
1) Poor Service
2) Rude people
3) Extremely rude owner
4) Too much Nickel and Diming
5) Behave like Indian Baniyas
6) Charge you for using Debit card
7) Insist on cash only in this day and age
8) Worst customer service ever
9) Do not believe in using a Deodrant"}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet for veggievores. Reasonably priced, and quite delicious. Aloo gobi is a winner."}
{"text":"Wow! 
This place is fantastic. The price is very cheap for what you get. The service is kind. Totally recommend this!
*I'm stuffed*"}
{"text":"Loved coming to New India Bazzar for the first time! All of the buffet food was fresh and hot! The tandoori chicken is to die for!"}
{"text":"Shame on them!! Prices on groceries are almost double compared to other Indian stores in the valley. They charged me same item twice and when I called them, they hung up on me. I went to store and they kept me waiting while they went through the video as they did NOT believe the customer. They came back after a while and refunded the double charge. Did not bother to apologize either. Extreme insult to a customer tht spend over $50 and stood there to pass the video test."}
{"text":"I love it. The butter chicken, korma, and other dinners and sauces are so good they must put drugs in them. It is very affordable, especially considering how expensive Indian food is in phoenix. It is relaxed, low stress, with Bollywood style videos playing quietly. The waitress we always get will scowl at you if you make a bad choice so you'll always know you're getting good food. The soda is usually a bit flat though :/ no real complaints otherwise!"}
{"text":"Would not recommend this place (Rest section). Service is not good. Water glasses are very dirty. Straw is not served."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, but have always missed the buffet which ends at 3pm. Today went with husband and for 7.99 it is truly a bargain. Not just for the price. The quality of the food is very good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's my new favorite Indian restaurant. My boyfriend and I eat here so much we worry that the owners will think we're stalking them. My favorite new discovery there is the Samosa Chaat. I'm extremely picky about Indian food and am rarely impressed, so for this place to be right in my own neighborhood is a dream come true."}
{"text":"Chicken curry and chicken korma were mediocre - very heavy on hot chili and tomato, light on other spices. I don't think we'd go back."}
{"text":"Was there last night.  Food was, as usual, good.  One of my favorites is the Gobi Manchurian that is crispy and spicy.  My whole family and my friends love this, so I was disappointed when the server told me they no longer serve this.  Instead, there is only a Gobi Manchurian served with green peppers in a sauce with a side of rice.  It tasted good, but isn't the Gobi Manchurian I love."}
{"text":"Indian buffet for $7.99...How can you go wrong?

This small restaurant is tucked away in a well stocked Indian market on 7th Ave, south of Virginia Avenue.  The buffet is small, and the food is well prepared and tasty.   Most of the main dishes have been the same the few times we have been here, but on the other hand, you can count on your favorites being there next time you go, and being sure that you can get your fix.

The Chicken Tikka Marsala is my favorite, along with the vegetable pakoras, and of course, the freshly cooked naan brought to your table.  I have never been a fan of samosas, however my vegetarian friend tells me they are the best around. My only complaint would be that the gulab jamun are not served warm.

If you are looking for a classy Indian restaurant to bring a date, this is not it.  It is simple place with the most basic of tables and decor.

If you are looking for a good Indian food at a very good price, then you need to try this hideaway."}
{"text":"Sad News, my fellow NIBers. The buffet has been discontinued indefinitely.:-(  I was surprised and disappointed to discover this today when my sister and I went there for lunch. A couple different boring combo plates are now available, with some variations possible. Of course, there is still their delicious chaat menu and their regular menu. Lunch business was nearly non-existent, not surprisingly  At least one group, that we recognized as regulars, left when they discovered the buffet was not available. No doubt, others did as well."}
{"text":"Let me first say that I have no problem with the food here. The food is great. Absolutely delicious. That said, it takes some pretty dang atrocious service to get me to give a restaurant that delicious only two stars.

My boyfriend is lactose intolerant. The first time we went here, we had no issues with that. The second time we went, he ordered something that didn't say it included dairy on the menu, and it came covered in yogurt sauce. Fair enough, we should have asked. When we brought it up with the waitress that he couldn't eat this, the first thing she said was \"You still have to pay for it.\"

We decided to try it again because it was so tasty. This time, before we ordered, we asked which menu items were dairy-free. The same waitress, this sullen older lady who clearly doesn't want to be there, just said, \"I have no idea.\" And stood there. We had to bludgeon her into getting the chef to come out and talk to us about dairy content because she had no interest in knowing or finding out. Classy. At least the chef was friendly enough.

 Like I said, the food was great, but I'm not going to keep going to a restaurant where the staff treats us like crap."}
{"text":"They are so unfriendly. Which us too bad because an international taste like this is so important in this community."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner with my family, the food was simply wonderful with no pretense in the surroundings. The butter chicken was wonderful with a warm spice and sweet curry flavors wrapped around the creamy tomato sauce,  my other half had the lamb koorma and was tender and covered in a rich sweet sauce whose aroma made my tummy rumble for a bite,  our son had the chicken tikka wrap and it was huge for 5.99 he loved all the goodies inside,  the nahn was wonderfully tender and garlicky.   The service was great our server was friendly and easy to talk to. We will defiantly be back to explore more flavors hidden in the Bazaar."}
{"text":"Well I spent my evening throwing up after I had dinner here. I went to get groceries & decided  to try their food; BAD MISTAKE!! The staff is rude and very unwelcoming. I'm new to the phx area so I came here relying on the Yelp reviews. 

The food tasted OLD and definitely NOT FRESH; I'm Indian & I think I can tell the difference between fresh and old frozen left overs you warm up. The cashier has no sense of customer service, he was trying to do 3 things at once, total fail! I asked for a pound of sweets and he pours in syrup and charges me extra for the \"extra weight\" !! This place is cheap and has horrible employees working there!! If I could I would give this place ZERO stars!!"}
{"text":"The Lassie is amazing!  Yay!

Great grocery assortment.

Great customer service, gentlemen thanks for helping get my catering to the car.  Much appreciated."}
{"text":"Last night was our first time at New India. I came in with four other friends. One of us is gluten-intolerant, and the rest are vegetarians. This is a WONDERLAND for anyone with vegetarian tendencies, though they also have a meat menu for the carnivores.

I had the palak paneer. The dinner ($12) comes with rice, curried vegetables, salad, raiti (yogurt), naan and a pickled side and a dessert. It's enough to have 2-3x leftovers. 

The food is delicious. If you love Indian food, but only can afford the buffet during lunch at most places... you'll love it here. It's affordable, genuine, and ridiculously good. I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"The stars because for me overall everything was average. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't a place that made me think, \"I've got to go back!\" Decent food, okay service, and just and overall eh experience."}
{"text":"New India Bazaar is primarily a dry-goods grocery store for all things Indian.  Or at least all things Indian that a honky like me needs.

If you're looking for bulk rice, cardamom seeds, black mustard seeds, paneer or anything else from the multitude of Indian ingredients that are overprices for being \"exotic\" in normal groceries, this is a great place.

There is a freezer case with Indian tv-dinner-style food, and frozen parathi and naan.  There was also a food counter of some kind, but when I went on a Sunday night it was closed - it didn't look like it was full-service.  I hear it is a chaat-style eatery.  Hours weren't clearly marked and no one was outwardly helpful, but if you went during lunch hours, you could probably get a snack.

No produce.  They do have the requisite Bollywood video section, though.

Gluten-free folks take note: you can get a ton of chickpea flour here for super cheap."}
{"text":"We went here on a whim with a hankering for authentic Indian food, hoping it'd be one of those hole in the wall gems--and boy did we get lucky! The restaurant is in the room behind the grocery part. I loved looking through the grocery at all the herbs and different kinds of rice! The restaurant food quality rivals the best of the best. We tried the lunch buffet, which was also a great price at 7.99/adult. Everything we tried was very good...and I had a little of everything! :) The reason this gets 4 stars is the dining area is a bit cramped and close to the buffet line, so you will say plenty of \"excuse me's\" whilst getting your food. Also, one thing that would make the food even better is to add more spices!!! I'm talking cardamom, fennel, more garlic--that sort of thing! Otherwise, impressive!"}
{"text":"I have been to over 30 Indian restaurants on three continents.  Who would have guessed my new favorite would be attached to an Indian grocery store in downtown Phoenix.  If you don't like their chicken tikka masala I don't think we can be friends. We just see the world too differently.  AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I pride myself on being open and adventurous when it comes to trying out new spots to pig out at. This happened to be one of the experiences I would say wasn't bad but definitely a memorable one. Google maps suggested this as an Indian buffet... so I thought why not. Upon arriving we were greeted with a not so genuine hello accompanied with a not so genuine smile. The food was good but not worth visiting again since the service was not on par. As I am writing this wonderful review I and my lovely fiancé are still waiting for our naan bread. It is now going on 10 mins... in conclusion good food... not good atmosphere or vibes."}
{"text":"Oh wow. We went to this place Tuesday, November 17th 2015. The grocery store looked average, and the environment smelled very authentic. Upon entering, I noticed that out of the 20 or so tables in the restaurant, only one was occupied. This was a little surprising considering it was right around 5-6pm; perhaps that was during their dinner lull in business.

My friend and I were told by a gentleman there to have any seat. As we walked towards a table, the hostess (I'm guessing) told us to sit at a specific table, near the end, right next to the other occupied table. I would have preferred to have some space, and there was plenty of it in the restaurant. Oh well, no problems.

After being seated, and looking over the menu, I placed my order for Chicken Tikka Masala, with the option of their Thali dinner. I don't remember everything that was listed on the menu the the dinner contained, but I do remember being excited about the pickle in particular. My friend went to order, and the waitress just gave her a death stare, and suggested she tried something else.

Anyhow, an amount of time passes and the waitress brings out our food. We each ordered the full dinner, and it was delivered on what appeared to be a stainless steel dinner tray, more commonly used in the Army or in prison. There was no pickle to be found, but a strange assortment of extra items. Some mysterious white sauce (pudding?), which tasted strange. Some type of sweet potatoes, which was alright. A very very sparse, generic \"salad\" consisting of one slice of cucumber, one cherry tomato, a couple rings of onion and a few pieces of lettuce. There was also something I'm not sure what it was, some sort of nut thing with a vinegar-type sauce? Tasted awful. But my main order, the chicken tikka masala was acceptable, and the naan was very good.

When we asked what the mysterious foods were, the hostess completely ignored our question. I asked for the check, and the hostess asked why I wasn't going to eat the rest of my food. I told her I needed to get on the road and I had eaten everything I wanted, and the food was very good. She then told me I should try to buffet then, and pointed over towards an empty buffet that closed a number of hours earlier. I was confused by this. The hostess brings out the check for my friend and I (Separate checks). My friend puts cash in hers, and I put my credit card in mine, and we wait for a while for the hostess to come collect these and finish our business. Some time passes, and the hostess brings my friend's book back with change in it, but we notice she is also palming a $20 - the same $20 my friend originally was paying with. My check was MIA, perhaps the credit card machine is taking a while to process? The hostess just wandered past us to the back of the store, where the $20 in her hand disappeared, and she just continued hovering around us giving us bad looks.

Perhaps 5 minutes later the hostess finally brings my card and receipt back, and then proceeds to stand there (With her hands full of our used dishes) and waits for me to fill out the credit card slip. I was not going to fill it out in front of her, and I've never had such odd service in my life. After waiting and realizing she isn't going to leave, I just scribble in a small tip, close the book, make sure to grab my receipt and we get ready to leave. 

As we proceed out, we noticed two cockroaches (live) on the floor under the table next to us. They most likely watched us eat our entire meal. All in all, the food was alright for what I ordered, the vibe and atmosphere was terrible (although the chair was not uncomfortable), the hostess was the center of my review though - she spent more time sending hateful gazes at us than anything. And then ignoring our questions, and just saying odd things, coupled with the overall odd feel of the place (no one else came into the restaurant in the over hour we were there), I would absolutely not recommend going here unless you want a story to tell. The service took a while, especially considering the other table had their food by the time we were seated. It took us over an hour overall for the entire dining experience, and it did not take us but a minute to figure out what we were going to order. 

TL, DR: main course was alright; super weird and slow service, weird vibe, and lack of cleanliness = an experience to remember."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Never knew this gem was so close to me downtown. Loved it! Chicken curry was so good. Be careful. Mild is pretty spicy  medium is very spicy."}
{"text":"The food is great, so we've always made a point to come here, even though there's an Indian restaurant closer to where we live. However, I was spurred to write this review by the fact that they are ALWAYS super rude. Without fail, they treat us like garbage and like we're inconveniencing them by giving them our business. I'm giving you my money; the least you can do is be polite or at least smile."}
{"text":"Great Indian food and good prices. Great store to buy all your Indian cooking needs ... Will be back."}
{"text":"They do a different rendition of the Gobi 65 that is quite tasty. Wish they had a vegetarian price on the buffet though, the current price is okay for meat items but kind of pricy for spinach and potatoes. I visit the grocery next door quite often to grab good heat and serve foods and yogurt drinks to carry to work."}
{"text":"Good value for the money but surprisingly bland. Anytime you can get all you can eat for $8 it's a good deal. I love Indian food but I tried everything on the buffet and did not break a sweat. For me part of what I like about Indian Food is the heat. I did notice at the end of the buffet there was a bottle of Mexican Cholula hot sauce. I guess I was supposed to use that? Even the chutney had no spice. Butter Chicken wasn't bad, Lamb Curry was very bland and watery. Can't see myself going back, I've had tastier Indian frozen meals."}
{"text":"The service was fine, I guess all the rude guys took a day off or something. Tandoori chicken was very good, except that the vegetables that accompanied the chicken were too greasy. One piece of chicken was much harder than the other ones, probably it was a leftover from the day before.
Garlic naan - perfect. Poori - will not buy it again; it was raw and kind of stinky. Overall, not bad and a lot of food for just $10."}
{"text":"Guys, I have lived in different states, tried different  Indian restaurants. Being from India, I also know what they are cooking and how their food tastes like. 
I must say food is 2 out of 5 stars.
They had buffet and greed took over them and now they serve you small quantity of food for 7 bucks and also 9 bucks.

If you pay by credit card you will get a stink eye------ Beware.

I DO NOT recommended this restaurant. I also have doubts that they just say its a Indian restaurant but in actual it isn't."}
{"text":"Great little market with attached restaurant (or dining hall). Weekdays they have a buffet, which is always well stocked with the usual Indian fare, incl. veggie and meat dishes as well as salad and desert. You get free Naan and they make a very good and strong iced tea. It's in walking distance from where I live, so I am lucky and get to stop by often... :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I just had lunch at this yummy buffet.  We have been  To at least eight different Indian buffets over the years, including two in Europe, and this is the best by far.  The butter chicken literally melts in your mouth.  Everything was tasty and the price was almost too little for this great food.  We will go back!"}
{"text":"I would give it no stars if it was an option. Saw a roach on the wall and the guy at the register said \"better on the wall\". Food was ok, butter chicken so so."}
{"text":"It was one of the best Indian place I ever head , and I've tried many of them ! We were group of 10 people.
and we had beauty as our waitress she so generous and the food was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this place for years, and never would have stopped here if my friend Salavador hadn't offered me a taste of his chicken tikka masala one day.  The ambiance isn't much to speak of--you eat at some tables at one side of a grocery store or you can take your food to go--but when the food is this good, who cares?!  The prices are incredibly cheap, and you get rice and naan with every meal.  I took reviewer Trudeau's suggestion and added a chaat to my meal, and I didn't regret it.  Super yummy.  I also got chicken saag and aloo gobi, both of which were excellent.  The only thing I would change for my next order is to ask for the food to be mild.  I should have taken the other reviewers' comments about the spiciness of the food to heart.  \"Medium\" here is \"hot\" elsewhere in town.  My nose was runny for about an hour after finishing dinner because it was just too spicy for me.  As a bonus, you can shop in the grocery for all kinds of exotic (at least to me) items while you wait for your food.  I will definitely be returning here in the future.  It's my new go-to for Indian food in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet was delicious.  The ambience leaves a bit to be desired, but all of the food was seasoned well and fresh.  I am definitely going back."}
{"text":"The food was ok nothing special and I missed the part of the description that said bad for kids....which is very true.. The food is way too spicy..for kids. Aside from that I would get take out from them if I was in the area looking for Indian food."}
{"text":"Food is average, service is poor. We ordered thalis and the quantity was too much for a single person."}
{"text":"They changed the buffet format and upped the charge. They decreased the dish options and removed the salad bar. Plus now my stomach hurts now when I eat their food. Business has looked like it slowed since this change. I hope they realize they had a good thing going and revert back soon. Until then, I'll eat fresher Indian food elsewhere."}
{"text":"I cannot forgive an Indian restaurant mixing white rice and curry together and calling it biriyani. That is low man.
Giving 2 instead of 1, for the samosas."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good! Chicken tikka & naan are my favorite things in the world :) I paid $27 for an order of garlic naan, regular naan, butter chicken, & chicken tikka with a soda. Lunch buffet is only about $8 so I suggest going around that time. Service was decent but only because the food came pretty quickly. We were not greeted, at the end the server said was it okay, after we paid we got no have a good night even after I told her to enjoy her weekend! Lol whatever the food was good, but I hope to find a better Indian restaurant in the Phoenix area because of the service."}
{"text":"First off: I LOVE THIS PLACE!  This place is like family to me and I'll go here for as long as they are in business. Perfect for Indian imported groceries or if you're hungry and you don't feel like cooking, you can dine in or take out delicious meals. 

My favorites: 
Butter Chicken- The chicken is tender, juicy, and it soaks up the color from all the spices and flavors it gets marinated in. The sauce is perfect!

Chicken or Lamb Vindaloo- I've had both. I prefer extra spicy foods. If you like it hot and spicy, I suggest you request them to make it extra spicy for you. It is a hot lava heaven of flavors. The potatoes resemble embers because of spices and the dark red color of the sauce. It's awesome!

Aloo gobi- if you're wanting more of a spiced veggie dish, the cauliflower/potato combo is flavorful, it has a slight little kick of heat.

Gobi 65- The cauliflower dumplings entree. WOW! It's a mild vegetarian dish, but it is warm and comforting. The cauliflower dumplings are in a subtly spiced yogurt gravy, and the best way I can describe it is like India's version of an alfredo sauce with cauliflower. I highly recommend it, it's so good!

Samosas-  Great vegetable samosas! The filling is balanced with the holy trinity of Indian spices like curry, cumin, and coriander. There are even bits of cilantro in it as well. You can never go wrong to order these as a snack or to add to your meal.

Best garlic Naan too, perfect texture and fresh! 

Last but not least, THE BEST EVER!!!
Fresh Pickled Lemon/ Lemon Chutney- This deserves a mention. I've been told these lemons are fresh from the family lemon tree, it's a family recipe. Grandpa Singh won't teach me how to make my own, so I have to come here and ask them for large containers of it or bring a jar because they are the BEST and no other Indian restaurant has this, so it's a rare treasure. LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM! Best lemon chutney you will ever find in Arizona! 

In conclusion, I love this place! I love the people! I've tried a few other Indian restaurants and most of them don't even compare. There are plenty of other items to choose from on the menu. This place never disappoints me and it deserves a higher rating!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a decent Indian option in Central Phoenix, and this place seemed to be getting the best reviews.

The good?  The naan was at the table when we were ready to eat, which is nice.  The service really was pretty decent here.  They had veggie samosas, and a couple of different daal dishes.  The paneer tikka or whatever it was called was good, and something I don't typically see on Indian buffets.

Unfortunately, the curries seemed a little too soupy for my taste, and there were only two options (Curry Chicken and Butter Chicken, booooooring).

I guess I'm now spoiled after so many excellent trips to Kabab Palace in Tempe.  Oh well, I guess I still don't have a good Indian option for Central Phoenix.  At least the price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Do not go here!  I can't tell you whether the food is good or not because I didn't even get that far. My boyfriend and I love Indian food and we were excited to try a new place.  The grocery store is situated in the front, with the restaurant in the back.  Upon entering,  I noticed the man at the register was CLIPPING HIS FINGERNAILS!!! This obviously made me concerned about the cleanliness of the establishment.  I quietly turned to my boyfriend and asked if he thought it was a good idea to eat there, but he said, \"it's okay, let's just try it.\"  So I continued to the dining area and took a seat.  A lady came and asked if we wanted the buffet,  but we said no, and asked if we could see a menu.  She then looked at us like we were seriously inconveniencing her, and reluctantly went to get a menu, then started talking to the man who was clipping his nails.  At that point, we just got up and left.  DIRTY AND RUDE!"}
{"text":"Not fancy nor do they have an extensive selection. In fact they are just a few chairs and tables in the back of an Indian market. But what they make they make well. I specially like their butter chicken and chicken tikka masala.  Their tandoori chicken is served on a bed of onions and is not as interesting. As well he just doesn't stay warm. They serve absolutely delicious gulabjamoon (a syrupy doughball dessert) and have a decent Indian chai.  Hot Naan is included"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. With a new addition to my family, my wife and I are looking for less formal and less expensive places to eat. We started eating here because the Phoenix Community Acupuncture was across the parking lot. We really feel as if we've found a gem in our part of town. 

Informal, connected to a store and there are places where Baliwood videos could be turned down...but well worth it. 

We have gone for the buffet each time we have gone. The price is very reasonable and they don't mind that our one year old picks off of our plates. Everything is good, but the Tika Masala was very tender and delicious."}
{"text":"Well this was an odd experience. 

My girlfriend and I have been wanting to try this place for a while. We finally made it there for a Friday dinner. Upon entering, the man made a gesture towards the restaurant. We walked in but must have still looked confused because he told us to sit wherever we'd like. 

I was pretty excited. It smelled great and we were both very hungry. We took a seat and waited for the service. It never came. After about ten minutes, I walked to the front and grabbed two to-go menus. There was a lady behind the counter but she never acknowledged us. We figured the to-go menu was pretty similar to the real menu so we took 5 or 10 minutes looking it over and deciding what we would like. Still, no one had acknowledged us at our table. 

After a while another couple had walked in, been given a menu and waters. My girlfriend suggested we leave but I wanted to wait around. I was more curious than anything. The one waitress took other orders, refilled drinks, brought out food, but we just sat there. Completely ignored. 

The waitress never came and my hunger got the better of my patience. After about a half hour, we left. I tried to make eye contact with any employee but they all looked away. 

We left the restaurant laughing at the weirdest dining event we have had in a while. 

I guess we won't be going back?"}
{"text":"Loved it. Grocery/small restaurant.... 7.99 for the non veggie combo plate. It was great portion. Food taste great. I will definetly be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Indian food and happened to be talking to some neighbors about their favorite place in the Phoenix area, which led me to New India Bazaar.  This place certainly doesn't look like much from the outside, but the food was quite tasty.  I stopped in and ordered food to go and it took about 20 minutes - not too bad of a wait.  I thoroughly enjoyed the chicken tikka masala, garlic naan and a mango lassi and my husband enjoyed his biryani...all so tasty!  We'll definitely be back next time we're craving some amazing Indian food!"}
{"text":"Was disappointed to find that the buffet was discontinued. Would come here at least once a month. Restaurant was empty. Can't see them staying in business much longer with the current concept."}
{"text":"Chatt, Tea and Pizza three of the surprised I found on my last trip. 

Most buffets have the usual suspects garnished with rice naan and some condiments. But to have a Chatt available?  Chai Tea (included) and even pizza (yes Indian style veggie pizza and its good)

This is why I am so in love with this place, 1 Great Flavor, you can beat the unmuted flavors that sing in your mouth. 2. variety, there is more to Indian the palak paneer and tandori chicken and pakora. 3. Value great price for a wide range of options. 

Next time you are in take a look at the left end of the buffet first and see if you can find a Chaat."}
{"text":"Looooove this place! They food is great and the prices are better. The lady that runs the waitress side reminds me of going to a place in New York. She walked up to a table and said \"eat your rice!\" I love it!!! She's like an Indian mom. We love her! Excellent place!"}
{"text":"I use to love this restaurant until my friend found a roach leg in her water and there was stuff floating around in another. Disgusting! Never coming back here again. They still had the audacity to charge us after all of this."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! I got the chicken curry thali dinner, and I am so stuffed. 

The 2nd time I went, I had the lunch buffet. It was awesome, as expected. I love the samosas and the tikka masala. 

Good value for the quality and portion.  As I had read the server lady is quiet, but kind like a mother. She showed me where to find the ingredients in the store part, when I had asked about the fennel mix at the counter. So sweet. 

this is a must have if you are in Phoenix and are a fan of Indian food!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years and it has never disappointed. The grocery store has everything I need at reasonable prices. The restaurant has absolutely delicious food I love everything I've ever eaten there try the whole menu."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian restaurant in Phoenix, be it Buffet or a la-carte. (I'm a veggie)
I have never ever been to any Indian Restaurant and came out so full. Have been to several la-crate in evening and tried lunch buffet today. Every dish was awsome tasty, including Samosa, Gulab jamun, mango custard, Raita, Kheer, DIY Papdi chaat.

Usually an Indian restaurant has few star dishes and few OK dishes, but here we tasted every dish and liked it. Surprisingly it is priced lower than other restarunt, may be due to not-so-great ambiance.

They prepare fresh Jalebi every evening, but I have enjoyed great taste even after a week in home fridge (Just microwave it for 10-12 seconds). There are several Indian sweets on sale too.

Service is a bit slow (or careless) so remind to refill your breads (freshly cooked). You get wheat naan here as part of buffet (a rare feat). You cna't go wrong with this place. Weekend Buffet 8.99 & Kid buffet is $4.99. Looks like week day buffets is cheaper.

 I'll be coming here again and again."}
{"text":"This afternoon we were in central Phoenix and thought of having some quick Indian snacks. Found this place nearby n here goes our experience..

We walked in and saw colorful clothes n accessories as if walking to an Indian street shop. We went to seating area.. were greeted n given the menus. Decent so far. I ordered chaat papdi and my husband ordered chole bhature. Papdi chaat came in a boat shaped plate which was inconvenient to mix in things. Chaat was sort of bland if jugded by Indian standards.  Chole bhature was just ok. Bhature was too thick.  

Half way down my chaat, I saw a HAIR in the dish. I was disgusted and showed it to the waitress who was initially reluctant to even acknowledge my claim. Then came another guy and immediately took away the dish and offered another one.  But I was pretty full (eating bhature from my husband's plate :) ) so I refused.  Later the waitress also came around and asked if she could get me something else. I politely declined...

Later when we went to pay the bill, the waitress and the guy were confused on how to nullify the order for the chaat. So my husband offered to pay for it since I had eaten half of the dish. After a moment of hesitation, they AGREED TO ACCEPT THE MONEY FOR THE DISH THAT WAS RETURNED.

We paid... looked around the grocery section and bought a couple of things. And we headed to the door, when I hear the waitress calling for me. She gave me a brown bag and apologized for the chaat.  I relcutantly accepted it. Later I found it was couple of samosas with sweet and spicy chutneys :)

I was going to give 1 star....  but for this kind gesture by the waitress later... here goes 2 stars...  

Btw, our neighbors had thalis which looked interesting..."}
{"text":"The food was really good! Maybe a little pricey for the portions, but everything was tasty. I am a vegetarian. I got the chana masala, samosas, garlic naan, and Dahi Vada Chaat. I did manage to spread it out to be 2 days worth of dinners. 

I subtract a star because of the customer service on the phone. I asked for plastic silverware and the woman on the phone first didn't understand me (language barrier) and then she said \"yes\" to my request without following through. Luckily, my postmates driver saved the day! She gave me plastic utensils and napkins, as all of my dishware was still in boxes."}
{"text":"Ate there one time. The food does not taste good. The grocery store is not the cleanest place in town."}
{"text":"Holy shit!! Just ordered on postmates because they had a special, and it was amazing. I had aloo Gobi, a red eggplant curry, and a garbanzo bean side dish. It came with naan and frybread, and a delicious sweet bread. I'm obsessed. I can't wait to go in person."}
{"text":"5 stars for the fact that New India runs a lunch kitchen with fresh food made by one very nice lady in the back of the store, every day. 

If you're a gringo, you're at a disadvantage to enjoy the food here, because the menu will probably make no sense to you. But if you're an *adventurous* gringo, you'll love it. And if you like Indian food, take it from me that this is the only high-quality Indian meal to be found in all of central Phoenix. Yes, I'm familiar with all the other ones. 

As with most kitchens operating within an ethnic community grocery store, you can't come in here expecting a standard restaurant experience. When you first walk in, you'll probably give a bewildered and confused look at the store clerk behind the cash register, who'll have the same look on his face simply because you're a gringo in an Indian store. Cut the guy some slack; he's a grocery store owner and his business is running grocery stores. He's not trained in the art of waitering! But he is a nice guy.

Eventually, one way or another, you will wind up with a menu in your hands while seated at a table. On the front side of the menu, there are 10 or more \"chaat\" options, which most non-Indians are unfamiliar with because you don't see them in standard Indian restaurant menus. That's unfortunate because that's all the good stuff. If you're going in totally blind with no idea what chaats are, but you are hungry for lunch, my strong recommendation is that you ask for the \"aloo tikki chaat.\" This is an all-vegetarian entree, made to order and put on your table piping hot, for a whopping 3 bucks. It's basically a potato-based jumble of spicy exotic sauces that tastes like heaven. Once introduced to what the basic concept of a \"chaat\" is, you may want to try other varieties of chaats on the menu during other visits. 

Another option to try, also vegetarian (I am a carnivore by the way; but the best vegetarian meals on earth are Indian, let's face it), is channa bhatura. Again, not something most non-Indos I know would order in a standard restaurant. It's often called channa masala, and is basically a dish of spicy chickpeas in a yummy masala/sauce, served with a fresh-made \"bhatura\" (a cousin of naan, the bread many are familiar with). 

The samosas here are great, if you're looking for a familiar appetizer from standard Indian menus.

Naturally, you won't be served water. Instead, you get up to grab a dixie cup and pour it yourself from an orange cooler in the eating area. 

The key to this place earning its 5 stars is simply the lady who makes the food in the kitchen. She's really good and knows how to cook, and that's all that counts."}
{"text":"The buffet is delicious! Hard to find Indian food such as this around phx. The service is a little funky but it's a store and a restaurant, I think if I were Indian I would have probably had better service"}
{"text":"Sadly I will never come here again. The food is just as great but the service has become unbearable. If you've read my last review, you'll see that I mentioned the lady who serves and how she lacks  in the good sense department and customer service. I chalk this up to culture differences. So I usually just laugh it off in my head.

Today I brought my mom and sister here and the lady throws our straws. When she gathered our dirty plates she slammed them atop one another. I found it useless to tell her thank you as she continually scowls and can never bring herself to say \"you're welcome\" I hate to bring up the fact that she was very welcoming to the Caucasian patrons. Hell she's even nice to my boyfriend, apparently he has the right shade of brown. Lol I can imagine if she knew he was Latin. No more extra Naam babe, you've been outed. 

So it is what it looks like. I'm nice and respectful so I have no choice but to go to the obvious. She's another foreigner that has these twisted preconceived  notions in regards to minority's. Yeah, you may think I'm nuttier than squirrel sh^t but I'm not someone who thinks every inconvenience has anything to do with color. This lady though is mad! So while the food is good, I will not spend my time or money eating at my second favorite Indian restaurant. In the wise words of my sister, it should be mandatory for citizens and foreigners to take some type of cultural sensitivity training before opening any business. I did think of a joke though, she must be the bizarre in New India Bazaar. Hey I didn't say my joke would be funny."}
{"text":"Had lunch which is quite affortable, $7.99 plus tax. I would suggest you go early so that you can get the best selection and fresh food. Everything was nicely done, simple but tasty. It included chi tea, dessert, and salad as well. The place is not fancy but its clean, the staff is nice but not overly indulgent. That's also a little sort of grocery store adjacent to the restaurant which makes for a good after lunch activity, like getting incense and whatnot. We will be coming to this place again soon."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is a good value at $7.99.  There was a standard selection of typical dishes, from tasty samosas to tandoori chicken and chicken tikka.  I appreciated that some of the dishes had a little kick and weren't dumbed-down to cater toward an uncultured American palate.  The buffet also came with some very plain but fresh and warm naan.

The service was average and the decor is very basic.  A small Indian grocery store is also located within the building."}
{"text":"Mmmmm curry.   I stopped in to this place by accident.  Honestly, I was looking for another restaurant and found it was no longer in business.  Driving up the 7th Street Corridor in Phoenix, I found New India Bazaar.  When I get the urge for curry I have another go to Indian food place but it always left me with heartburn.   Not New India Bazaar. 
 
Don't let the outside deter you from trying this place.  The strip bar next door is de classe but the food here is worth it.   I was excited to see that they had a lunch buffet with several options.  Butter chicken, tandori, curry, masala, curried black lentils and curry chickpeas, fragrant white rice and Nann all you can eat for the low price of $10.   I'm adventurous and like to try all the various options so i pile some rice in the middle of my plate and add the various options on the side.  Chicken in all the options was moist and  flavorful except the tandori.  I found the tandori chicken dry.  The nann was delicious and warm.  Nann is constantly being made fresh.  

There was a second buffet with dessert options that I did no try.   I have been back once and still find the food tastey without the heartburn.  If you're into fine dinning and frills and thrills keep driving.  This place is all about the food.  The service is okay.  They ask you if you're dinning in or to go, take your money and get you on your way."}
{"text":"New India Bazaar operates a pretty on-par indian lunch buffet experience. You have your staple items (naan, rice, samosas, chicken, and the little salad bar) at a reasonable price. Service is not the highlight of the visit but, hey, it's a buffet. If indian buffet is your mood, take your appetite to NIB. But if you want some kind of romantic ethinic dining experience -- well, taper your date's expectations."}
{"text":"Stopped in to purchase some spices, the owner was talking to another person in his native language, at first I thought it was a customer. But after ten minutes of him talking with the same person it was either a visiting friend or a family member. I stopped at the counter to ask for assistance finding a spice that I didn't see in the aisle. He continued his conversation in his native language and gestured in my direction but never stopped talking to the woman he was talking with since I  walked into the store. I walked down another aisle and still did not see what I needed. So I left why spend any money at this store when it's obvious my patronage is not wanted. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Very bad Custmer service in Restorent. Your order something and gave you something else. The lady waiter she don't know how to smile how to take the order and serve on right table . I m not recommend to my friends and family."}
{"text":"EAT HERE! This has become not just my favorite Indian restaurant but favorite restaurant. I caught myself eating here 3 times in one week.  Whenever I ask my date where we should eat, this seems to be the answer. We are definite foodies and should be ashamed of how much of our income is spent on eating out.

****I've never eaten at a buffet that has such fresh food.  They don't put out tons of food and let it sit, they continually replace with small fresh and hot portions and tend to keep an eye on what needs to be replenished.

It's 9:30AM on a Sunday morning and my love and I are laying in bed, WAITING for this place to open. We consulted Yelp for the hours and began to browse the reviews, just knowing there would be some comments about the service, or a waitress named Beauty. Beauty is definitely a character, and is one of the reasons we love this place so much. To anyone who says she should brush up on customer service, nah, brush up on your sense of humor.  She's a riot. Laugh with her, smile at her, she is a delight. I will never tire of this place ...1 hour and 30 minutes until it opens ... and I hope Beauty is there."}
{"text":"For the price, the best Indian place in the central Phoenix area. I prefer to order off the menu but the buffet offers some unique options. And don't let the comments about the surly waitress dissuade you. I have seen her smile - you just have to become a regular to get on her good side. :-)"}
{"text":"We kind of stumbled upon this place and it turned out to be one of my favorite meals from our whole trip.
I had the korma and it was great. The portions were huge. It came with the mixed vegetables with creamy sauce, rice, vegetable curry, nan, chapati and the desert of the day. It was literally incredible and super filing. I shared it with my girlfriend and we didn't finish it all.

If I lived in the Phoenix area this would be one of my frequent spots. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Everything on the buffet worth a taste.  The paneer tiki masala had my attention today.  Butter chicken and curry chicken stood out as great entree choices. Less spicy today than I am used to, but no matter what the flavor are most surely here."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is $10... 6-7 mains dishes, rice, naan, and Samosas. Food itself is really good, chicken dishes were amazing. It's in the back of a store, but worth the lack of ambience."}
{"text":"Food seemed okay, service okay, my wife likes the Indian movie selection - but can't recommend a restaurant with a known insect problem."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since it was a handful of tables inside the grocery store. For a while, I was there almost weekly. Not only is their thali dinner the best value for Indian food in Phoenix, but I have received the warmest service most of the time. I moved out of Phoenix last year and had not been back in quite a while, but when I returned I was still recognized. When the server discovered my friend had never tried Indian, she insisted on bringing a variety of food for her to try so that she would know what she liked. Try the butter chicken - it's the best!"}
{"text":"Very casual restaurant/grocery store combo. Had the buffet  lunch on a Sunday.  Excellent. $8.99. See pictures. What's  different  from the usual Indian  buffet  is the dishes  here are Punjabi region. The dishes are mildly spiced, not hot at all. The flavors are very buttery  and luscious. The butter  chicken and the saag are really  outstanding and great for vegetarians.  I believe  this is the region that tandoori originated, and here they do this type of Cooking terrifically well. There breads like Naan are just like back in the north Indian region. Yum. Wish I was a local, not just passing through."}
{"text":"Food was ok. I've always loved Indian food and have tried it at many different places including India. This place will definitely get you out of a bind if you're craving some Naan."}
{"text":"Indian comfort food and grocery.  Dinner (in the restaurant section of this building) is served traditionally with several other dishes to on your tray to balance the palate.  Everything is made fresh right as you order it...the vegetables chopped, the dishes spiced.  Cheap price for so much food including dessert!  Soooo delicious!!  Long vegetarian menu. Two TVs in the place play Bollywood movies and videos.  Funzies!"}
{"text":"i still love woodlands the best but a lunchtime craving for indian food paid off when we went to new india! i got the palak paneer combo- the portions were great as was the food. the spicy chutney they served was amazing. the gobi was even better- spicy and not overloaded with sauce. the prices were decent and the service was great- i'm assuming it was the owners that were working. i really want to go back and try the buffet too!"}
{"text":"Nice portions for the price. The curry chicken and side potatoes YUMMY! Only downside was it was a lil more spicey than i requested. I told the guy out of 1-10 i want 2 spicey. They made it 4 spicey. 

Came with some sides that looked alien to me. What is the white creamy stuff? Smells like yogurt.  Err no I'll pass.

I took mines to go. It's basically a grocery store with a restaurant. I'll be back tho. To get some incense, cool jewelry and spices"}
{"text":"I love this place we order food once every two weeks consistently. Great flavor and good prices."}
{"text":"Really authentic Indian food! The food was great, and for the first time in my life the waitress gave us a few extra dollars that we left for a tip because it was 'too much.' Will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"The food is so delicious and the desserts also. The veggie curries are yummy with garlic nann. I also cannot stop having Ramaslai - white dough in milky syrup. Now they start to have a buffet. I could not wait to try the buffet. The music videos are rock! The market has lots of selections."}
{"text":"For me, the food was way too spicy, but I managed to eat a huge dinner here anyway.  I am the only one at my table that must have felt that way--altho I said nothing to anyone--but, then again, maybe several others did, also, and just were to polite to complain.  Who knows?  
The food appears clean, however, at the end of the meal a lone roach was walking thru the place on the floor.  Do I need to say more about New India Bazaar?  Think not.
Will I go back?  Are you kidding?  No.  Just don't feel like sharing my meal with the cockroaches.  Disgusting!  Thank heaven I saw it at the end of the meal and not when I walked in.
Say \"hi\" to the resident cockroach for me when you get there.......sigh."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Followed Pierre's review and ordered the Chaat.  Great food.  If they put the food in a high class restaurant they could charge double the price.  The only downside in the atmosphere...it's kind of fast foodish being in the grocery store."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is medicore at best, def. better food to be had elsewhere.  I usually only go there for the chaat.  However, today we were informed that the restaurant wasn't taking any chaat orders as the kitchen was too busy, all after the waitress had already taken our order.  Meanwhile, one or two other customers were given chaat orders to-go, I'm guessing they called ahead of time."}
{"text":"best chicken tandoori and mango pudding ever tasted! complementary nan is decent"}
{"text":"They have a solid lunch buffet. Almost every item is good and many are excellent. And it's only $8. I've been enough times to know they rotate the dishes so it's not the exact same thing every time. Some of the best dishes I've tried were vegetables like the cauliflower and okra. But the butter chicken and lamb are stand outs as well.
But I wish they would bring the brown gulab jamun back ! They used to always have it on the buffet, but I haven't seen it in a year. It's my favorite Indian desert. 

Almost every time I go it's busy. There is another buffet on 16th street that's good too, but I think I like New India Bazaar slightly better.

They brought back the gulab jamun. I like it better than the white ones they had for a while."}
{"text":"Stopped coming here. Owners have decided to change their serving style and not for the benefit of the client. Sad to not go back but it was nice meanwhile it lasted."}
{"text":"I ate at New India Bazaar for dinner. I took it to go. I ordered samosa, pani puri chaat, and gobi. The samosas were very good and very big! The main dish, gobi was really great. As a vegetarian it seemed like I was eating chicken, but it was cauliflower dumplings. The gobi had a comfort food appeal. The pani puri chaat was weird. I've never had it before, so I don't have a comparison. The description sounded yummy, but it just wasn't. The total cost was about $14. I would recommend this restaurant. I noticed that they have a pastry case with desserts. I plan to come back to shop. They  have the best prices that I've seen on neem toothpastes."}
{"text":"Went for the buffet. Great meat and veg choices. The staff was very friendly and attentive.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! Although they looked at us like we were crazy when we wanted to order off the menu at 11:15am, it was a great experience. 
We ordered our food extra hot because that is how we roll...it wasn't over the top hot; just right IMO.
This was my first experience with ordering chaat, and I'm now hooked...I had the pani puri chaat, totally awesome but didn't expect it to be cold....once I got past that, I couldn't stop stuffing them in my face. Then came the aloo tikki chaat, just the right amount of sour and heat...wonderful and I pretty much liked the bowl.
Wife ordered chicken find aloo, best I've had of that dish. 
A couple of drinks and the tab came to just 21 bucks....we'll be back for sure.
*note....not a nice place by any means, it is in the back of a grocery store, which is situated behind a strip club named, and I'm not making this up, \"band aids\"."}
{"text":"What a great deal on great food. Of course, this 5 star rating is for a $7.99 buffet; I'm sure fancier restaurants would have better food. But the value is excellent and the staff are courteous and solicitous. I especially liked the tiki Marsala, yum yum. We are definitely adding this restaurant to our rotation!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good nan, but limited selection and food was not very fresh, probably because I was there late... may be better earlier in the lunch day."}
{"text":"They have my favorite premade chai packets- just add water! Ginger, masala and cardamom. Love that stuff!!!"}
{"text":"OMG Beauty our waitress was amazing. I can't wait to go back just to see her. We loved everything we ate. My first Indian food experience and I loved it. Only downer is no alcohol :-)"}
{"text":"I liked this place. The food is not that spicy and the chai tea is part of the buffet which I have not found anywhere else. Positive experience. Will go back again"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed this restaurant on every visit over the last 5 years. Excellent food, large portions and great prices. Try the Samosa chaat and anything with lentils!"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is so good!  And the staff really couldn't be nicer.
My husband and I have been twice, once for take-out and once for lunch.  The friendly man at the counter took the time to explain the difference between northern and southern indian cuisine to us, which was very helpful.  Everything we have had has tasted great, but I especially love their samosas, which are also included in the lunch buffet.  We are happy to make this our new indian food spot!"}
{"text":"Great little grocery store with a restaurant! Just happened to be driving by and stopped for some goodies and decided to try the food. It was excellent and SO cheap! A plate is $6.99 and that includes a lot of rice, 2 entrees, and half a naan. Our plates were clean and we were both stuffed when we finished. The chicken was tender both in the chicken tikka masala and the butter chicken. I also enjoyed the paneer masala. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We only went to the grocery store. We have never tried Indian food and were not brave enough to try it since we have no clue what anything is. The man at the shop was really nice and even let us try some candy before buying it. Out of the 6 items we bought we only did not like one and that was because it was too spicy and it was pre- packaged   Not hot spicy, just spicy from so many spices. He gave us a menu to for the food, maybe we will come back for the lunch buffet that way we can taste the different dishes they have to offer."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant in CenPho. They are very helpful when I ask for recommendations without meat or dairy. The prices are absurdly cheap. I also enjoy shopping for pantry items while I'm waiting for my order. Keyword vegan for those of you searching."}
{"text":"Butter chicken is amazing!! Also a secret menu! recommend this for casual dinner or lunch! Awesome find."}
{"text":"This place is half market and half restaurant.  The restaurant is very casual and had a great lunch bufeet for a small restaurant; the buffet which was $7.99.  The flavors and spices were really good, I'll be back. ."}
{"text":"3.5 stars would be more accurate. As others have mentioned, this place is attached to a small store (goat on sale right now for $3.99...not bad) and that makes the vibe a little odd. No big deal though. I liked the place fine, especially considering how close it is to work.

Spoiled now by all of those new Indian places I've been reviewing over the past few weeks, I thought the food here was decent, but not great. I like that they had samosa on the buffet. I've not seen that lately. The chicken tikka masala was good, if more mild than I am used to. Nothing was bad, everything was good, nothing was super outstanding. A great lunch place for $7.99. Dinner prices are low too. I'll try that some time and report back. 

Service was basic...they bring you a drink and you pay at the register, so I don't have much to say about that good or bad. Not friendly, but not unfriendly either. It is a store with a restaurant in it. Bottom line."}
{"text":"Fist time here, I order in California all the time.  Naan needs work and chicken masala was okay."}
{"text":"There is no more lunch buffet. They still serve the same food, but now you have to pick between two and three dishes, depending on which combo plate you pick. This means your variety is very much limited. What used to be a solid four-star buffet, is now a three-star Panda Express like experience. Sadly, I will not return. This was a very poor business decision."}
{"text":"Seriously!? 
This place has mediocre food, but it's open in Sunday so my GF and I go here sometimes. 
Never again. They are seriously unbelievably rude the last two times, to the point of outright hostility. 

\"If you can't smile, don't open a shop\""}
{"text":"The food was good but the portions were too small.  Also the ambiance could be improved and the place could use a little cleaning.  I might be back in a month or two to see if they've gotten better."}
{"text":"Yet another little gem. A diamond in the rough. They have all the basics and spices in bulk for making your favorite Indian dishes from scratch here. They also offer mixes and blends to help make it all a little easier. You can find paneer in the fridge and some great pre made Indian foods in the freezer. They also offer several homemade deserts and wonderful little snacks and treats in the Chaat Cafe. 
When I stopped in, I was intent on a snack at the chaat cafe. The employees were attentive and helpful. After viewing the menu sheet, deciding on the pani puri and the stuffed chile pakora, I  ordered at the counter. The man working the counter warned me that it was spicy. I told him I am sure I've had spicier and I am looking forward to try them both. 

The chile was a quite large Anaheim style green chile stuffed with potatoes peas and other spices dipped in a seasoned batter and deep fried and sliced. An Indian chile relleno. Quite substantial it was served with 2 dipping sauces, a tamarind chile and a cilantro based sauce. The pani puri was a nice treat with the spicy tamarind liquid and crispy little pockets. This also came with a small portion of potato and chick peas and a side of the tamarind chile sauce. 
What a great snack/light late lunch. It really hit the spot. Plus I found a few Indian treats I had been looking for."}
{"text":"Really friendly/ good service from staff. Has a mini Indian food store. The restaurant side was clean, and trying out 2 dishes it's good. I've had better but I've also had many worse."}
{"text":"Found this little take-out gem when our go to Indian was closed. Great food, family run, and excellent prices! Food tends to run more towards the medium to spicy end. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place WHEN it had a buffet. However, THERE IS NO BUFFET. Food is still decent but in small portions."}
{"text":"HORRIFYING EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!  DINERS BEWARE!

We had lunch at this place yesterday......it turned to be a horrifying experience. As I finished lunch portion and got myself some of the dessert, while conversing with my friend who was enjoying his round 2 of lunch.......I noticed a C O C K R O A C H  walking around the stuffed and fried potatoes serving dish at the buffet bar! Yes you read right a F'n cockroach!  I was disgusted, nauseated and nearly vomited. I brought it to the lady's attention (she does not speak English!!!!), she called another guy who took the dish to the kitchen. When they opened the kitchen door, I became more nauseous.  Kitchen looked awful, dirty and unkempt. They guy then came out and started walking around as if nothing had happened. No one apologized or came to talk to me about this miserable experience.  I insisted on speaking to the owner. They finally got him. I told him about it. He immediately canceled the check and that was pretty much it. No apologies, no what action they will take to remedy this. 
needless to say, I will report this to city health department.  But I thought everyone out there should know about this.  In this day and age, in the U.S., this SHOULD NOT happen!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the \"new\" concept.  No buffet, but pre-cooked food, think school cafeteria.  All the downside of a buffet, with none of the upside.  Same item as buffet but choose either two or three items combo with some rice and naan.  None of the good fried stuff.  No cucumbers or vegetables or chutneys. The serving was mostly sauce and over cooked. Styrofoam plates and cups. We would go a few times a year to this place before the change.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"The food was good but the terrible way I was treated far overshadows this.
I purchased a Groupon for New India Bazaar. I paid $12 for a $24 Groupon as advertised in the headline but it comes as 2 Groupons at $6 for $12.  Unfortunately, it expired and I went to the business to redeem my Groupons at the original amount paid today. I had a horrible experience. At first I was told by the waitress it was expired and no good. I explained Groupon's policy and she claimed to not know what I was talking about. I asked to speak to the manager and I was told to go find him on the other side of the store where he was sitting with his feet propped up (he would not come to me). He said he did not think I could use them for the original price and he did not think his account was active. When I objected, he finally checked and reluctantly and let me use only one of them for the original $6. I was treated very poorly and everyone was quite rude. I have absolutely no desire to go back to the business to make another purchase in order to redeem the other $6 I have already paid!  I was not even asking to get the discount, just to get the money back I already spent!  Needless to say, I am not going back."}
{"text":"PLEASE READ THROUGH THE BAD REVIEWS FIRST BEFORE GOING TO THIS PLACE. 


I am shocked that this restaurant actually has 3 stars. Food is decent. Nothing special. I would give it 2 stars for how cheap it is. But then with the price, it comes with cheap owners. Their attitude is disgusting. Not only are they rude, the owner (guy) went to the extent of accusing me of trying to steal just because I gave him my card and not cash. I was okay with him for charging me 50c extra for my card, but I didn't want to break my cash as I needed it for simething else. Regardless, telling me that he knew I had cash in my wallet but I was using card because I could challenge the transaction and get back the money was just beyond every limit. 

It is okay if he is from a family who steals from people, or where manners were never a thing to be learned, but accusing customers of malpractice is just ridiculous. 

I also saw his wife being extremely rude to another customer when he came up and asked her for Naans. Even in India, the restaurants have much better decency. Not sure where this family is from, but they definitely lack the basic etiquette and manners that most of the human beings have

I am ashamed that they are from the same country as I am. 

I would strongly advise you to stay away from this place. You will be occasionally lucky to have a good experience, however, its really not fun being insulted."}
{"text":"Small, well stocked Indian grocery store with a good lunch buffet.

Pros:
+Fresh naan that's brought to you as you're ready for it
+ Food isn't too spicy for those with sensitive stomachs and/or new to Indian food
+ Veggie samosas and mint chutney yum
+ Chai available in the buffet line

Cons:
- Gulab jamun too dense and not served warm
- Restaurant isn't oozing with ambiance

All in all, quite nice, quite good."}
{"text":"This is not \"fast\" food.  This is \"at their pace\" food.  It took forever to get someone's attention to order, then the food took *longer* than what it takes at a full-service restaurant, and then it was a chore to pay and leave.  Other patrons were getting impatient as well with the staff, just meandering around, taking their sweet time to ring someone up while a line formed with people buying Pepsi & other items.  Really, really frustrating.

Older building too, not so nice inside with decor.  Like eating inside a Seven-Eleven with less lighting.

Food was just alright, but perhaps above average for Phoenix standards because Indian cuisine in Phoenix doesn't compare well to most major metros.  Portions were generous.  Prices were pretty much the same as a full service restaurant.  Food served on either styrofoam plates or metal TV-dinner tray."}
{"text":"Great food. Good service. Wished the had the buffet but I guess they are going to bring it back soon. Lunch portions were a little small, but they gave me a few samples of other stuff so it worked out well. Also the sweets are out of control. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I was almost put off by the negative reviews and the  outside appearance.... but holy cannoli!!! SO IMPRESSED. SO DELICIOUS. We had it delivered, so I cannot comment on the service, but it was so good that they could have punched me in the face and I'd still go back. If you're on the edge about eating/ordering from here like I was, DO IT!!


***UPDATE: Okay, so I ordered twice from here and it was INCREDIBLE. Third time was borderline disgraceful. My entree, which was supposed to be 'very spicy tikka masala', tasted like cheap store bought tomato soup... disappointing doesn't begin to describe it. Because my previous experiences were absolutely wonderful I will be giving them another shot... I will update afterwards."}
{"text":"WORST Indian Food!!!!!! Sadly I had been to New India Bazar as my colleague wanted Indian Sweets and we decided to try out the lunch. Firstly, lady who got us lunch had a bad attitude. She was pretending as if we are eating lunch for free. They didn't have plates to start with and food was empty in the buffet counter. For $10 they just had very few options and out of that most of the things were already finished. Chicken curry just had gravy and no chicken. Chicken Tandori was cold and chicken tasted very bad. And above all the lady was scolding people for not completing the food. I have had lot of indian food as i was raised in India and sadly this restaurant is setting a bad example for how indian food taste."}
