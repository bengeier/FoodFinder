{"text":"First time here, it's clean, not too crowded, definitely cozy. Great for dates or a nice place to study. Service was fast and pleasant. Food is nicely proportioned. Will def come again. Location is great. Right off of yonge and major Mac."}
{"text":"Ordered a cake from there, although the cake looked beautiful but it tastes horrible! and it was suppose to be a pistachio cake, but they make a walnut cake instead. 
I would never order a cake from there again. 
But their pastries are good."}
{"text":"Had a scoop of pistachio and a scoop of saffron ice cream with crushed pistachios. The pistachio was alright, I've had better elsewhere but the standout was the saffron. It was so unique and so delish!"}
{"text":"This is a Persian owned cafe , I like their pastry , especially rollette and napolitain , they are not too sweet . I have been there few times to get some rolls and cookies, but every time I experienced very cold service, I wasn't greeted , not even say \"hi\" or a smile! Today I was passing by , so I decided to pop in , they weren't busy , only one lady there picking up her cake , so I waited... and waited .....again I was ignored even tho I was standing right in front of counter and there were 3 staffs ! And then another Persian lady walked in , guess what ,they just skipped me and started to help that lady , another few minutes past , finally someone said to me \" I'm coming \" with a squeezed fake smile on  her face , and then turned around doing something else ! My patient met the limit , so I left !  You will get better service there if you are Persian ."}
{"text":"This was a great find on yelp!! Came in from Texas and was craving some Persian tea. The staff was very attentive, the ambiance was quaint, and the desserts were fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Please clean your bathroom.  The eggs were cooked perfectly. Did not care for the hash browns. All in all, probably not a due over."}
{"text":"Came here one night for a dessert. When we arrived, there was a sign by the front door that said wait to be seated, but no one came to help us - even though there were two waitresses behind the counter who clearly saw us standing there. We eventually walked up to the counter  so the sign really served no purpose. 

We were seated in the cozy lounge upstairs and ordered: 
- napoleon 
- pistachio rollette 
- tiramisu 
- cafe mocha
- traditional Persian tea

We were fairly impressed with the items we ordered. The pastries were yummy and not too sweet, which is perfect for us. Our favourite was definitely the napoleon - really liked the layered custard with the flaky pastry. The cafe mocha had a perfect balance between espresso and chocolate. 

I took one star off for the lackluster service - the initial confusion of how we are to be seated and the waitress forgetting what drink I ordered."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery on Friday at 10:45am. They never showed up. Tried calling multiple times to find out what's happening and the phone rings with out answer. The place must have closed down."}
{"text":"How come they dont have menu or any price list??? We ordered 2 items of desert, one americano and cup of tea and i paid 30 dollars. Asked clark why is it so expensive and she answered nothing lol just ignored my question. Anyway way too expensive...never going back. Is it because we were asian and she charged more???"}
{"text":"Amazing service and food! I came across this café by accident while walking around downtown Richmond Hill. I discovered this café 2 weeks ago and have been there 3 times already. I have tried the coffee, espresso, lunch and many desserts and can say they are all fresh and worth the price you pay. I love the design of the café, very cozy and modern at the same time. There is a second floor that is perfect for studying or working on the laptop. Free Wi-Fi, great lighting, comfy seats/booths, and enough electric plugs. One thing that I appreciate is that even though this is a Persian café and the server will often speak their language they treat everyone equally with outstanding service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love going to cafes and decided to try this one out. The cafe was decorated really nicely and quite busy when we went. I ordered the Pistachio Rollet and  tasted average. We sat there for around 1.5 hours to study, but the cafe was very cold. They had windows open in the middle of winter! Not sure if we will be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely PERFECT. Great food, stunning atmosphere and music. MOST importantly, the food and desserts is jaw dropping.

Order the Tuna Melt - 10/10 QUALITY

Order the Atlantic Waffle - Best ever blend of smoked salmon in a waffle, ever.

Order the moccasin-looking-chocolate-filled dessert. Have no idea what the name is. Super soft, but will rock your taste bud.

If I had two stomachs, I would honestly eat another order of these dishes in the same sitting."}
{"text":"came here with my gf. we both loved this place. it was my first time having persian sweets. i gotta say the cream puff and the rolls were my favorite. i recommend this place to anyone who wants great desserts."}
{"text":"I've ate here several times, Breakfast and lunch. The food has always been fresh and made to order with sizable portions. I definately would recommend."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. 

First impressions was good, nice ambience, except later when it got a little busy the noise carries quite a bit. 

The food itself is both good and original, with nice presentation, but I'm docking them on the service. 

The service was slow, even though it was not busy at first. 
Our server confused our table for another on three separate occasions. 
There was a large gap in time between when the first few and the last of the main courses arrived.
We were missing cutlery, and asked for it three times. We eventually went downstairs to get it ourselves. 
The server was visibly frustrated, leaving you to think the problem is yours.
As it got busy service continued to decline.

Overall the poor service tainted what should have been a good experience. I don't know that I will return, maybe for something simple like coffee and desert."}
{"text":"Very nice and cozy place. Liked that place for the atmosphere. Food is great too. Delish smoothies. A lot of fresh choices. Great coffee."}
{"text":"Best persian bakery in the area. Amazing variety of icecreams including saffron, pistachio, pomegranate. Good place to sit also"}
{"text":"Still part of my exploration of new eateries around the York Region area, I was dying to go to a new cafe/coffee house besides the traditional Tim Hortons or Starbucks. My friend suggested BB Cafe in Richmond Hill, to which I agreed.

Upon entering the actual building itself, the parking entrance is actually in between BB Cafe and another building beside it, and the parking is at the back. It is a little bit deceptive, but if you drive slowly, you should be able to spot it. There's plenty of parking spots at the back. 

Entering the cafe, you have two entrances. One at the side, and one in the front. We entered through the front and my first impressions were great. When you enter from the side, you have the display for sweets, pastries, cakes, and where you pay. By the front entrance, you have a fireplace, and a few tables and chairs. There's also more room upstairs, and if you must know, the washroom is downstairs by the side entrance. 

We sat down, and one of the staff members brought the menu. After glancing through the menu, which I believe it was not overwhelming, I decided to try the Marakesh mint iced tea, and a slice of their coffee cake. We did not have to wait long, and upon taking a bite out of the coffee cake, and sipping the tea, my taste buds were in heaven. It could not get any better than that. They have a lot of traditional Persian teas, and next time, I will try something different.

They also do catering, in the sense that they bake cakes, and one can order a custom one, or a pre-made one. 

That being said, one star is docked off, as they could keep the place a little bit cleaner. There were some cobwebs by the window sill, and the tables could have been cleaned. We had to inform them about the table being cleaned. 

Overall, customer service and the food/drink items were great, and I can definitely see myself coming back here."}
{"text":"Fantastic place located in the older section of Richmond Hill which serves great treats and excellent tea. Very affordable, and they serve right to your table after ordering. Get the teas which are kept warm by candles! Also can be used as a study spot but be aware on weekends there are pretty loud conversations by local Persians who are there to catch up or celebrate birthdays"}
{"text":"Excellent place to have a good quality breakfast or lunch at a reasonable price. Have tried many things and nothing has disappointed me yet. Onion rings are especially good."}
{"text":"I like this place!
First of all, they have their own free parking spot.
They have really lovely environment. I visited this place for twice with my girlfriend and she loves it as well. We took the table on the second floor and it was quiet and the perfect place to enjoy conversation.
Their bakery is delicious. I enjoyed with coffee and my girlfriend took green tea. Both beverages were enjoyable as well.

I will for sure visit them again to have a nice weekend tea time."}
{"text":"We were here with a group of 4 adults and 2 kids.  The service was super slow but the food was good.  Servers were friendly, but can't get past the fact how long we had to wait.  We waited about 1/2 hour for a glass of water.  And after we ordered our desserts (pre-made cake slices).  It took them over 20 minutes to bring us our desserts.

Service was poor in the sense that we had to wait and misleading information & menu.  We had ordered ice cream waffles and banana split with a banana strawberry smoothie.  After we got the smoothie, everyone else got their desserts (pre-sliced cakes) the banana split and ice cream waffle was no where to be found.  Asked the server and the server advised that they ran out of bananas, and their waffle machine isn't working.  That's when I told them my order for main course was the Atlantic Waffle, so if the waffle machine is not working, then they should let me know in advance to pick another main.

After 1/2 hour later, the server came back with a banana split (I guess they went to the store to get some) and ice cream waffle... but the banana split had no whip cream on it (menu states that there's whip cream).  The ice cream waffle had no ice cream... so both had to be sent back to have them properly added.  That's when they told us that they realized the waffle machine wasn't plugged in properly.... 

Description on the mocha states that it's artisan coffee with art work, but it was just coco powder sprinkled on top of my mocha.  No art work to be found here.  Another group of 5 showed up after us and sat across the room from us.  As soon as they arrived, the server had told them they are busy so it will be a bit of a wait.  They sat down and waited to be served.  After 1/2 hour of wait, no server came up to get their orders and they didn't even get a glass of water.  So they got up and left.

Despite the LONG wait for the food and the numerous incorrect orders, the food was delicious.  We arrived at 8pm for a quick dinner (main & desserts), and we ended up staying there until 11pm... not that we wanted to, but we had to since they took forever.

None the less, when we were all done.  The cashier (which I think is the owner) asked for our opinion.  We gave her our opinion more as recommendations on how they can improve, but she turned to the server and asked her to jot it down.  There was some attitude there and we felt like the server was being blamed.  However, that's not the case as the server did try her best to serve everyone (both up and downstairs plus the cake stand).  They should hire more staff for both on the floor and in the kitchen to make it more efficient.

Although the food was good, the experience was a complete turn off for me.  We will not be returning again."}
{"text":"My wife and I came across this cafe 3 months ago, after a nice reading session at the Richmond Hill Library near the cafe. At first, I was unsure of what to get, but the workers/staffs there were more than happy to aid us pick our orders. Even though, my wife and I enjoy to leisurely take our times while choosing our orders, which could be very difficult and frustrating for some staffs, the staffs were very enduring and easy-going despite us taking a long time. We ended up having variety of different and unique teas. Definitely one of our favourite spots to visit, and have visited multiple times since. Prices are very reasonable and affordable. Also can't miss out how pretty and aesthetic the place looks. Would definitely recommend this place for anyone who is looking for a peaceful study place, or a place to chat with your friends."}
{"text":"We always buy fresh pastry and yummy cookies from both of the locations. Very satisfied and absolutely recommend them."}
{"text":"Total hole in the wall. Would definitely recommend. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The desserts in the cafe looked really nice and fresh. I have got a selection of baklava, some sort of layered cake (which reminded me of cake Napoleon) and some dessert that I have never seen before... Nom nom nom.
Highly recommended if you end up near Steele's and Yonge.

I am also planning to go back there again for a cup of tea as the set up in there looked very nice."}
{"text":"BB is indeed one of the best Persian cafe's in the city! They offer a wide range of desserts! I tried cappuccino with swiss roll (rolet) and they were good! Good news is that they just opened a nice and cosy sitting area on the second floor!"}
{"text":"Love this place. They have a large selection of fresh pastries no matter when you visit. I have tried most of their pastries and they all taste very good. The place is always busy and full of customers. They have pastries for all occasions. I think this is by far the best Persian pastry shop in town."}
{"text":"We were there on Friday for lunch.  We ordered chicken sandwich, roast beef sandwich  and Lux crepe; they were all good; the side salad came with the sandwich was fresh with right amount of dressing.  4 stars for lunch.  
We should order their tea instead of Americano :S It was our fault.  3 stars for coffee
There wasn't much choice for dessert in the afternoon.  3 stars."}
{"text":"Came here for dessert after reading the reviews of this place.  I have to say it lives up to its popularity.  Decor and atmosphere is very nice here.  Very comfortable and relaxing, we spent the whole night here talking and catching up.  Tried several desserts and they tasted as good as it was presented.  I especially liked their tea, it was so pretty and the taste complemented the dessert so well.  Had the crepe and roll cake.  Both were delicious.  The saffron ice cream is a must-order, so good!!!!"}
{"text":"So BB! I like this place, it is small, prices are decent (not the cakes they used to be decent now they are ridiculous) and the sweets, tea and coffee are pretty tasty...but, they lack service. They are not unfriendly, except for the one woman that works the cash most of the time and can't or won't smile if her life depended on it. They are just disorganized, almost lazy like. Everytime I have been there, I am always waiting on service, everything is slow they are always chit chatting away or if it is busier there are 3 people waiting on the cash just staring. Most of the time they ignore the line and decide to ask who ever they like to ask if they need help. This is a total put off and every single time I go I get really annoyed yet I come again and again."}
{"text":"Lovely cafe upstairs with the most delicious cakes and pastry. We ordered tea with a bunch of different pastries and they were all REALLY tasty. There is some secret receipe they use for the cream in the pastry that tastes just like how amazing stuff tasted in childhood. I would've loved it even more if the pastry was slightly less sweet though. Not to mention the amount of sugar in their pastry is probably a fraction of what you'd get with Starbucks cookies or any of such. 

In the cute and cozy cafe upstairs, we were served in nice persian style teapots and cups. Too bad they are only in Toronto."}
{"text":"Got a pomegranate cake for my boyfriend's birthday last year, and I've been hooked onto their cakes ever since. Besides the fact that pomegranate cake is extremely hard to find, it was super delicious and beautifully made! (It was a mousse/sponge cake) I cannot gush enough about how much my friends and family love their pastries and cakes. If you ask my boyfriend what his favorite cake in the world is, he'll tell you workout a pause, this pomegranate cake. Sincerely a forever loyal customer  lots of love for their cakes, i promise you, you'll be hooked like me once you try this cake!

I know some of the other reviews mention the service, there is a bit of a language barrier, if you don't speak farsi and really don't know what to order there may be some difficulty. I would recommend checking the menu online, or calling ahead to order for pick up (this is always what i do, so the checkout procedure is always smooth and friendly). Don't let this stop you from trying the best Persian middle eastern style cakes in the area (pistachio, pomegranate, almond flavors are some of the amazing unique flavors)"}
{"text":"Great for breakfast or lunch. The food is really good and not expensive. Also, you can call your order in ahead or they deliver so it's the best food you can possibly get if you have less than  an hour for break at work. No up-charge for onion rings."}
{"text":"I stopped in for tea and a pastry. I ordered a mint tea. My dining companion ordered a Persian tea, but she said it just reminded her of Lipton's.

We ordered a pistachio rollette and a couple cookies. The pistachio rollette was very soft and delicate and had a lovely vanilla flavour. The only evidence of pistachios were those few sprinkled on top. 

We didn't really luck out with our cookie selections, unfortunately. One pistachio cookie was dry and not at all sweet. The other, that looked like a small puffed pastry cookie, was over baked, dry, and didn't have much flavour.

I would come again for the rollettes and tea, but I'd definitely skip the cookies."}
{"text":"this review is going to be less fleshed-out than usual due to sleep deprivation and overall feeling like garbage. plus medication. bear with me there will be some sense to be made here, yet

comfortable atmosphere, free wifi, quiet, cozy, the most polite staff probably anywhere! i had the most amazing waffle in life today with pomegranate ice cream and berries and honey ugh i just wanted to rub it all over my body instead of eating it. plus a delicious and perfectly sweetened iced pear tea to boot

im happy

this place is why

i dont want to leave i just want to live here on their waffles and maybe the crepes too idk ill try them another time

love,
me"}
{"text":"Worse service of my life, the front desk was multitasking and running around. They were short staffed and extremely unprofessional. The service was VERY slow we waited for a coffee almost 39 minutes! The milk and cream was provided so late that my coffee was cold, the coffee was disgusting and extremely strong. My boyfriend was very upset since his cappuccino was cold as well and all phom! 

We wanted to buy some pastry/ Iranian cookies to take home and perhaps try a few in the cafe shop but the lady that served us would not allow that and made the conversation very confusing and stressful. Shortly after we sat down we realized another lady beside us has done that is eating some pastry from a take out box! 

Worse experience ever, worse coffee and worse customer service! NEVER EVER going there again and I will tell all my friends and relatives in Richmond Hill!"}
{"text":"Nice quaint Persian cafe.  It's a pity that they have so little place to sit. ..."}
{"text":"This is the most amazing place to go for a date, me and my girlfriend went to try it for the first time and we enjoy our time. With the amazing costumer service, home made cake, food presentation is like 5 star restaurant.

Highly recommended place to go for a date or business meeting. It's quiet, clean, and with free wifi also. 

Reservation is great, well prepared.

Me and my girlfriend Definitely coming back over and over again."}
{"text":"Horrible food and service.  I got a couple of cold sandwiches and onion rings.  It took over an hour.  The chicken salad was room temp by the time I got it and the lettuce wilted.  I am not going to eat it in fear of food poisoning.  I won't be getting food from here ever again. I tried calling to let them known what happened and the guy on the phone arrgued with me about when I placed my order.  I did it online through the yelp app so I have confirmation.  If you want good service there are tons of restaurants around Chandler. Got to any one of them but here."}
{"text":"Ordered a pistachio pineapple cake and a mocha. I was surprised when I saw the pistachio cake arrived. The portion was so generous. I thought the waitress gave us a quarter of the cake. The presentation of the cake was attractive. There were floral decoration made of white chocolate and there was chocolate drawing on the plate.  At the first bite, it didn't taste as sweet as I had imagined. The kore I ate, the sweeter I tasted. Anyhow, I like the pistachio taste and the pineapple was refreshing. The mocha was sweet. I think I have made a mistake. I didn't mean the mocha was not good but I think coffee or black tea may be a better beverage that goes with the pistachio cake. Anyway, I will make a better choice next time.

I would want to try other cakes or desserts next tume."}
{"text":"One thing you should know before coming here is that they're not very good at English here. It seems like most of their workers aren't able to answer your question (we asked if they had savoury menu and they looked at us with a confused face)

When we did order, it was painful to watch her write down word for word.. it's good that she's writing the order down exactly but when my order came they gave me a crepe instead of a waffle. I also asked for the caramelized pecan but got walnuts. This was after waiting 20 min for our food.. 

Overall their food was pretty good (my friend really liked he's Napoleon). And the ice cream I got was very good. Their other baked goods look good too. Food wise I would give 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Toronto Diary said that BB Café has the best Napoleon cake in Toronto so, yes, my expectation is pretty high. I walked into BB Café and took my first bite on Napoleon cake which is topped with puff pastry crumbs and made with several thin layers but not flaky. With so many layers, it became a little doughy and sweet cream is not rich and thick enough even it is filed in each layer. Is it the best? I think that's a bit more challenging.
But this café deserve its name with amazing Swiss Roll, don't judge a Swiss Roll by its appearance. The silky texture with smooth cream makes the roll so moist, soft and fluffy, even Paris Baguette can't compete such quality. The Swiss roll has three flavors; chocolate, vanilla and mocha and I love mocha better. I visited BB Cafe three times within 6 days and if you have a chance to visit Toronto, this is a place where you should go for an incredible delicious Swiss Roll."}
{"text":"If you want a cold, rude and over priced food for very small portions experience this is the place :/.
 
Long time to serve customers no friendliness nothing.
This place simply sucks."}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito is ridiculous! Sooo delicious. It is probably the size of a newborn baby and so good. I can't wait to take my husband here. I'm not sure I could order anything else after I had the burrito. Yum! The woman who took my order was also super friendly and made me feel very welcomed."}
{"text":"My fiance and I visited during a late evening to get some tea and dessert. We were both impressed by the ambiance and the service. The owner was there that night and was kind enough to take us on a small tour of both the upstairs lounge area and talk to us a little about the history of BB. 

The service was fantastic and the pastry was as good as Persian pastries can get. I had the regular (vanilla) rolette and it was delicious! They had a large selection of tea and presented the tea very well. Also, found out they have WIFI so we will definitely spending some time doing work there. 

Great place to go on a date, with family or friends for a small bite and tea/ coffee. They play lovely jazz/eclectic music."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic and place, the coffee here is the best in the world, even better than Britain. I also like the waitress, she is pretty, very charming."}
{"text":"Very intimate and cozy. Excellent service and a lovely menu. Great place for dessert or a nice lunch."}
{"text":"I typically like to go home and fully absorb my experience before writing a review, however occasionally something is either so good or so bad that it deserves commentary right away. In this instance it's the former, BB Cafe of Richmond Hill is the newest and best cafe to come to the town in ages. 

Props to Lee C, for her detailed review, and I won't comment too much more on the space as it is gorgeous, elegant and the perfect place for a cozy night out. In terms of location it's just north of Major Mackenzie on the east side of Yonge.

I came here searching for a quiet place to do work close to home and I found it! Free WiFi and plenty of outlets on the second floor for my computer. In fact the second floor was virtually empty aside from a pair of after school teenagers who made out shamelessly in the booth across from me. Come on kids, it's a computer, not a brick wall ha ha (ah well to be young as they say).

Given that this is a Persian cafe/bakery, I went for my fave Persian black tea and I was amazed at the extra detail that went into it's presentation. A small dainty tea glass, a single serving tea pot that was set atop a candle warmer so that each cup of tea was as warm as the last! I was even convinced by my server to have small dessert and she recommended that the \"must try\" dessert was one of their rolls. I opted for the small chocolate roll and it was perfect. I'm not a huge sweets person so the fact that this was only mildly sweet yet packed a perfectly balanced flavour I was a HUGE fan - stellar recco!

As I perused their menu I also noticed that they do an assortment of sweet and savoury crepes, various fruit and vegetable based smoothies and drinks, the standard coffee and tea options but in the bottom right hand corner I noticed a chocolate fondue option!!

With the number of sweet and savoury food options, warm beverages, free (reliable) WiFi and the excellent layout, I think this might replace Covernotes as my new Richmond Hill coffice (coffee shop office)."}
{"text":"This place is right next to my house. I love coming to BB Café to get some quiet time and some study time. It is such a cozy place to come and sit by myself while my son is at music school nearby. I love tea and their authentic Persian tea is phenomenal.  From the tea pot, to the tea cups, everything was beautiful.  Just to try something different, I also get the vanilla pistachio roll. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Pastries are made to perfection. If you want to have true persian pastries, here is the place to go. Cream puffs are to die for. I will highly recommend visiting here if you are ever in Toronto."}
{"text":"The BB Cafe was a welcomed surprise! 

The staff at BB Cafe were extremely hospitable, despite it being a busy New Year Eve lunch, our waitress kindly explained the variety of teas and pastries available. I was able to treat my grandmother, sister, mother and myself with two pastries and a pot of tea for under $15 :0 The pastries were not homemade nor was the tea overly extraordinary however the food and drink were delicious and well presented! Experiencing excellent service with the beautiful decor at that price was truly a great way to end the year!"}
{"text":"I love this place. their pastries are always fresh. the staff is very friendly. there are too many choices to pick for everyone with different taste, even a picky person like me. 

Love their cakes and I always order my birthday cakes here.
If you are looking for perfect dessert cafe I will definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My bf and I came here on a weekday afternoon to just relax and grab something light to eat. They have a very wide selection of things on their menu, but we got the south west savoury crepe($12), grilled chicken breast panini($9), and persian tea ($3). The food was okay, it was fine for a light lunch. I did like the whole atmosphere upstairs and the background music. It was a nice, quiet place for us to talk and spend time. I did however have a hard time pouring the tea because it kept spilling each time. This happened the first time i came with my friend. Not sure if its the pot or us. There arent too many nice cafés near this richmondhill area so this place is good to study or spend an afternoon."}
{"text":"Good Persian Cafe, serving many different kinds of good tasty deserts, all kinds of teas and coffee. This place has a nice relaxing atmosphere, no loud music and has a nice bonus- it's open late."}
{"text":"Great Persian tea.

So-so Persian desserts. The ones samples were too sweet, as expected."}
{"text":"Considering I have a weak spot for pistachios, rosewater, cardamom, I've been meaning to check out a Persian cafe. Upon entering, I saw a wide variety of pastries, desserts, and homemade ice cream. I would love to try the ice cream once the weather warms up! I wanted to try something Persian because the reviews for non-Persian desserts didn't seem that great.

I tried their zoolbia and this Persian pastry. I don't think I can be the judge of Persian desserts but I enjoyed both of them thoroughly. The zoolbia was reminiscent of a gulab but more crisp, in the say that they both very syrup-y.

The staff were really friendly too - when I asked them about of of the pastries, they let me sample some of them even before I made my order. Overall a pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"Nice establishment , very homey feel. Service was slow but friendly. Ordered dessert crepes banana split and lattes and everything was tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"Me and my bf stumbled across this place after a doctors appointment and we are so in love!! 

We had the persian tea, strawberry shortcake for dessert. It was fantastic. 

My bf got one of their energy smoothies and it was sooo delicious. We also got a veggie crepe and a chicken sandwhich! Both were very tasty. 

Definitely going back here. The service was a little slow however the staff was great in helping us since it was our first time. The place is packed and rightfully so, it is so quaint. Love the decor, love the food, love the entire structure. 10/10 would recommend trying if your ever in the Richmond hill area"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the BB Cafe's atmosphere, very quiet and intimate setting. As there are only a few tables to sit at, this shouldn't be too much of a problem as we were able to get seats quickly. It's a small quaint cafe with very developed flavours in their food. The soup was a squash based soup that was too die for. I also got a panini like sandwich that was crispy and a delight to eat. 

I would come back for sure to try some of their pastries or desserts. I can't imagine it would disappoint. 
10/10 would recommend again"}
{"text":"What a gem! This is an unexpectedly great Persian cafe located within a not at all impressive plaza. The coffee and pastries were great and reasonably priced. They also have a wide selection of dried nuts and exotic ice cream flavours. Most importantly, the staff was very friendly and tried to not make you feel like an outsider (as I am). Great place to chat with friends if you want to try something other than the well known francised cafes."}
{"text":"This place now closed.  No longer doing business.  Make sure you trade-in your restaurant.com vouchers."}
{"text":"I loved this place! The delicious food, pastries and drinks made me want to bring all of my friends here. Everything is presented beautifully and the price is great for the quality of service you are recieving. Upstairs has cute sections in which you can comfortably sit with your family and friends. A true diamond in the rough!"}
{"text":"Head upstairs! This has to be the coziest coffeeshop I have ever been to :-)

This is my first time here. I usually spend my Sundays at Korean coffeeshops but this Sunday I decided to try something different. Something with 4+ stars on Yelp and approved by Elites :-)

I will start off with the decor. Its very cozy and welcoming. You will feel like you are at a friend's or a relative's house. Perfect for chatting over coffee and sweets. Washrooms (downstairs) are clean and well maintained. Free WiFi.

Now to the sweets. Creme caramel is really tasty and I absolutely recommend it. Cheesecake is thick so make sure you have room for it before ordering it :-) prices are comparable to indie coffeeshops.

Free parking area in the back (follow the arrow!) I am surely coming back for more."}
{"text":"Nice Persian cafe. 
Pastries are nicely displayed. 

Ordered a few Swiss rolls. They tasted good but the chocolate ones were a bit too sweet for me.  

As I live nearby, I wouldn't mind dropping by once in a while, or bringing a friend over. Their ice cream looks quite tempting too."}
{"text":"Service is good. Prices aren't bad. Pastries are very good though. Cream puffs are very good and fresh. Must try"}
{"text":"Hmmmm... walked in by accident,the chicken Panini  is really tasty. Persian Tea is exotic and ... tastes good. Waitress is friendly. A very cozy place."}
{"text":"Came here needing a last minute birthday cake and I'm so glad I did. The staff are all so friendly and the environment is so cozy. We had the banana walnut cake and it was delicious, everyone at the birthday dinner loved it. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place couple times in the past and it used to be one of my fav dessert place to go to, but tonight is just very disappointing. We went an hour before closing and there was nobody there. Both the waffle and crepe were extremely soggy. The waffle was plain with just two scoops of ice cream on it. The waffle was not edible at all!! Also, the price has gone up but the quality has dipped way down. We told them both dishes were really soggy, they told us the \"machine\" wasn't hot enough. If they'd told us they had no customers and they were not ready to serve any edible waffle or crepe today, we probably would have stepped out and just come back another day. Definitely not returning after this experience."}
{"text":"Had their Turkish coffee and a chocolate rollet. The coffee itself was percolated on their gas stove and was a little weak compared to other Turkish coffees. The ambience was nice with large, comfy chairs and a fireplace on the ground floor. The owner extremely friendly, cheerful,  and accommodating, . They have a large selection of Persian pastries to choose from, so I think I'll have to stop by another time to sample some more."}
{"text":"Went with a friend to this cafe to pick up a few pastries and sweets to try.  I'm not familiar with many of the sweets, but they all looked so good. Along with the large variety of assorted nuts and munchies, cakes and sweets, they also have these pages of pure fruit made like those fruit to go's similar to the ones you buy at the grocery store.  I tried plum and could taste the difference instantly! So fresh and without preservatives.  Everything looked so good, I wouodnt mind visiting again if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"Not enough tables on the first floor, overall could be much cozier atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had a gathering with friends at this cafe. In fact, I found this cafe on Yelp first. There were two stories for this cafe. There were a few small tables on the first floor and also there were two transparent windows displaying the sweets and cakes as well as other treats. On the second floor, there were a few larger tables with a few small tables. I sat on the second floor and I felt it was more cozier to sit on the second floor. 

I ordered a piece of pistachio pineapple cake and a glass of mocha. I was astonished to see the large piece of pistachio pineapple cake that I had ordered. It looked like I was given a quarter of the cake. The slice of cake was nicely decorated with white chocolate flower on top with pistachio green on the surface of the cake. I could taste the pistachio and the refreshing pineapples inside the cake. The only negative factor I would say is the cake is a bit too sweet.

When the cup of Mocha came, I could see the multiple layers of the coffee, white, light brown and dark brown. Again, the presentation was elegant. The waitress gave me sugar on the side in case I need it. It's sweet enough and it tastes delicious.

{"text":"A quaint café with great food.

When I walked in, I was met with a sizeable array of small treats, all made beautifully. I immediately knew I had to try them, so I got a few small waffles, while my friend ordered an affogato. Both were surprisingly well made, and it's worth the price (small serving size but high quality!)

Will definitely drop by again!"}
{"text":"Came here in on a weekday morning and it was super quiet with the occasional walk-ins, make it the perfect setting for chilling or catching up with friends. 

Ordered a few different cakes, Persian black tea, Turkish Coffee, and 2 boxes of pastries to go, everything was $30 after tax and tip. 

The black tea was amazing in taste and presentation, pairs extremely well with the pistachio cake-rolls, and the tiramisu.

They also make full sized cakes!"}
{"text":"My FAVOURITE bakery of all time. 

Top of my 2018 list. 

The mini swiss roll cakes are the best. Each bite sends me over the moon with joy. I've never, in my life, had such good cake: soft, fluffy, delectably delicious. These cakes restore my passion for life, renew my zest to carpe diem.

Notable mentions: puff pastry, circular choco brownie topped with coconut flakes (dense AF and totally satisfies my cravings), chocolate wafers (this is THE shit, eff KitKat)

Yet to try: Ice Cream & Gelato (I've read such good things on Yelp)

Bonus: this is actually a super cute super secret date place. Chyeahhhh. Check out that second floor ;) Ask for the Turkish tea and choose a pastry!"}
{"text":"Really amazing tea here, desserts are fresh and not too expensive. The place has a nice vibe to it as well as it is so cozy alongside relaxing music. The only complaint I would have is the service. Since we are a repeat customer we notice this every time. Once we sat on the second floor and told the server that we would be up here, she said okay. About 20 minutes later of waiting (they were quiet that day) I decided to remind them that we still haven't taken our orders, lol. It's okay though the tea forgives itself!"}
{"text":"A great breakfast and lunch spot. Excellent food -- the breakfast burrito is stellar, as is the french toast. At lunch the bacon cheddar burger is excellent, and if you enjoy wraps you need to try the Turkey Cranberry Wrap - it'll remind you of Thanksgiving at any time of the year. 

It hasn't been super busy any of the times I've visited -- yet. That will be sure to change as word spreads about this hidden gem. Nice job by the staff too!"}
{"text":"Amazing saffron ice cream and cream puffs. So delicious and fresh. I'm not Iranian but I've developed an addiction to their desserts. They have awesome cakes too which are suitable for birthdays. Simply love it!"}
{"text":"BB Cafe, where have you been all this time????
Came here on a sunny Sunday morning, I walk in and the first thing i notice is how beatiful and cozy this place looks in sunlight!!

I have never seen a decor that compliments sunlight more than theirs, and they have plenty of windows to let the sunlight in. /sunlight rant over

Needless to say the atmosphere was really good and me very comfortable.

Now to the food. I had the roast beef and my SO had the Triple chees sandwhich, we asked to add chicken to the cheese sandwhich and they did. The food was flavourful and good.

The Americano was a little weak, i do believe their speciality would be the persian tea so i will try that next.
We had the chocolate fondue after that, and it was pretty damn tasty! I have never had a chocolate fondue before and I am a fan of it now.

Will definitely be going again, even if it is out of my route."}
{"text":"Oh the many adventures your taste buds will take you here at BB Cafe! Rose water, pomegranate, saffron, cardamom...truly a party for your senses.

Being my usual curious self I started asking about all the desserts. Tried their traditional desserts: Faloodah and Zoolbia but when we arrived at the cookie section the lovely staff member handed me a plate of assorted cookie samples to try, what a sweetheart!

Hubby and I decided on a scoop of Saffron ice cream with a hint of rose water, a scoop of pomegranate ice cream and a pot of Persian tea (enough for two cups) to eat in, and a single serve Napoleon with pistachios and a mini chocolate mousse cake to go. 

Persian desserts are NOT meant to be gobbled up haphazardly. Enjoy the experience of the moment and appreciate the ability of your tongue to distinguish all the different textures, spices and flavors used to craft their delicacies.

Some reviewers complained that the desserts are too sweet but you need to know the trick to enjoying their exotic offerings. You take a small bite then follow it up with a sip of their delicious Persian tea, no need to sweeten your tea with additional sugar AHA! Their desserts are a perfect accompaniment to their tea.

The best time to come is during non peak times so that you'll have the undivided attention of the staff. There are no labels on the desserts so if you're unfamiliar with Persian desserts you'll just have to ask. Fortunately the staff are more than willing to answer any questions and offer multiple samples for you to try. 

They have second floor seating good for big groups which also has a balcony. They have plans to expand their dessert and drink menu to include food items like their other location."}
{"text":"Phenomenal Iranian bakery. Easily the best I've found in Toronto. Be sure not to miss the Nokhodchi (Persian Shortbread Cookies), sublime."}
{"text":"cozy place specially in the winter with great stuff. Honestly u can't go wrong w Persian pastry. I always get my birthday cakes from here"}
{"text":"Far more than a bakery or cafe. This place screams talent, graciousness and joy! 

I can't thank them enough for making the most perfect cake for my birthday and goodbye party. This is the only place I trust to make both delicious and BEAUTIFUL cakes. See for yourself!"}
{"text":"Oh, yes the best Persian pastry in town. But I like the first branch in North York."}
{"text":"The best Persian pastry I've ever been to in North York area.  All the sweets, cakes and etc are very fresh and delicious. Also the. Persian tea and fresh carrot juice are delicious. You want to believe then try all yourself."}
{"text":"I can't quite bring myself to give this place a 5 star not because they don't deserve but maybe it's just not my thing. Being a Toronto boy I can say my taste buds are worldly but I can't claim to understand or/know how to appreciate all the ethnically diverse stuff we have in this great town. However, I think getting a solid 4 stars from someone who doesn't quite have a taste for this stuff is pretty impressive in my books.

Let's start with the best; amazing service! As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a lovely lady behind the counter. She was extremely patient and thoroughly explained each and every item they sold in the store (we had a lot of questions!). They even went above and beyond to allow us to sample many items despite our upfront disclosure that we were only here for a snack or 2. This kind of genuine service is a rarity!

We had sample a few pastries, a cookie or 2 and of course cannot forgo the baklava. Everything tasted very unique in it's own right and tasted exactly as the lady describe it. Cookies were super crumbly, pastries are fresh and light and baklava while tasted freshly made is a tad on the sweeter side and a few had a really different (odd) aftertaste. Of course, I consider it weird because I am not accustomed to it. It reminded me of goat cheese.

If I am in the area, I would definitely give them another try."}
{"text":"My first Persian café experience was a good one.

We arrived at BB café around 7:00pm on Sunday and it was packed. Luckily, we got the last seat. Pretty busy with limited seating. You go up and order your food and the server brings you the food/drinks. You pay at the cashier after you eat.

We ordered cardamom Persian black tea, a cake roll, and a zoolbia. The tea comes in a cute teapot with a tea light on a stand to keep the tea warm. I absolutely love cardamom Persian black tea. I believe you have to ask for this as the standard is a earl grey Persian black tea. The dessert were plated nicely with designs. I enjoyed the tea and cake roll. I found the Zoolbia to be too sweet, but we shared both desserts so the sweetness was manageable. 

Just a tip: The seating is limited and lots of people come in wanting a seat so this isn't a place where you can really lounge around, study at, or have long convos with friends as it gets pretty crowded (at least, on a weekend). I think most people get take out."}
{"text":"I came to this place to meet a friend, Richmond hill is not my neighborhood so I had to look up on the internet to find a place. Based on the good review of this place, we came here after work. 

The service was excellent! The staff gave us recommendations about their bakery, and their food was good. We ordered the daily soup and panini, everything was above regular cafe food.

They have tons of freshly baked goods and every single piece looks amazing! This will be my spot if I'm ever meeting with someone in this area."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Richmond Hill!

I've been a handful of times and never been disappointed. It gets better with every visit as I sample my way around the menu. At first glance BB Cafe looks like a tea, coffee and pastry shop, but don't let that fool you, they have a nice menu of delicious food. I am told that all the baking, food and ice creams/ices are made from scratch either in-house or at their other location in North York, so this is real food, take some time to drop by and try their goodies!

The pastries are excellent and really very beautiful and the skill used to create these yummy goods is apparent. The owners and the staff are Persian and they bring a great selection of their home baking and cooking to the menu. The service has always been very good, they are always happy to explain the cakes and pastries to me :-)"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast. The BB Breakfast includes eggs, sausage, country potatoes, and pan cakes. This is one of my favorite breakfast combos. Delicious!

I will return for sure next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"A friend and I travelled north to BB café yesterday evening for dessert and coffee. I had the Persian tea and a piece of the Neapolitan (?) with custard. It's located in the middle of a strip mall which overall makes you feel like you are walking in the middle East. However, the interior of BB café feels like a small uptown lounge. When we arrived the place was empty which was curious but by the end of the evening all the tables were full. Service was friendly and prompt. They have a fairly large display case of cakes and other pastries, it was based on previous reviews that I came upon my decision of what to have that night. And overall, the dessert was delicious.

The Persian tea reminded me of a spiced Earl grey, I can't confirm this but I feel that one of the sugar cube offerings was brown sugar mixed with saffron. Regardless, melting one of the brown 'triangles' into the tea made it so flavorful I could have easily had another pot. 

I found the price point very reasonable. And actually bought an additional two pieces which I intend to share with my extended family tomorrow. if you are in the area or looking for a quiet Persian bakery, I would recommend checking this place out. However, I wouldn't travel out of my way to go there again."}
{"text":"I had very nice Persian tea and Neapolitan cake. Can't wait to come back to try more of their other products, too. There is parking in the back, though the entrance is rather hidden (on the south side of the house)"}
{"text":"I was very pleased to read the reviews of BB Cafe here on Yelp.  Surprisingly,  a hidden gem in an obscure plaza.  When you walk in,  you'll see the mouthwatering desserts on the display counter.  We came in for lunch,  and I  ordered the vegetarian panini with grilled zucchini,  Bell pepper,  portobello mushrooms,  and tomatoes in a light mayonnaise spread. My boyfriend ordered Roast Beef on baguette.  Both came with a side of greens with olives and balsamic dressing. My panini was very good.  I didn't get to try the roast beef,  but with the way he ate it,  I'm sure it must be good.  The Persian tea was light and smooth,  a perfect accompaniment to the rolls.  Again,  he finished the marble roll and no chance for me to try, but the vanilla pistachio was awesome. Not too sweet,  but fluffy and light.  Our server was very friendly,  and I was impressed with the cleanliness of the place and the washroom.  I would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious Persian pastries, quality and flavourful savoury dishes, and breathtaking presentation. The ambiance is well above average, with warming decor, comfortable seating and great lighting and music.
The concept of BB cafe is a true winner. 
I would give it a 6/5 if I could, except for the organizational deficits. First, service is friendly but so slow, even when they are not busy. 
Also, DO NOT expect to productively do work on wifi. The atmosphere looks perfect for a study session, but the internet connection is frustrating at best.
Last- and this might be TMI, but they have a sign that says \"please do not flush toilet paper\" in their restrooms. This is a basic plumbing issue, they need to get their act together."}
{"text":"I love this place it's a super chill and cozy place to have food, study, or talk with friends. You can buy take out or just seat upstairs or downstairs and order food. I personally would recommend the Persian tea- they come in a super cute tea cup. I also tried the chicken breast sandwich, white pear tea, saffron tea and triple dip finger food. They were all really good!! The price I think is super fair and reasonable."}
{"text":"We were searching for an alternative from our usual brunch/lunch places in the area, and found this place. It is right off of Yonge Street with plenty of parking at the back. The first thing you notice as you walk into the restaurant is the wide array of beautifully decorated cakes and pastries on display. Any suckers for sweets will probably eye one or two of those slices right away. 

The service was as some previous yelpers have said, quite cold. Food wise was only okay for us. We ordered the chipotle chicken crepe, breakfast crepe and the boutique salad with chicken. They were quite accommodating with the minor changes we had with our orders, which was nice. But taste wise was nothing extraordinary. I liked my breakfast crepe as it was a cleaner version of a normal breakfast sandwich/burrito. The crepe was made nicely - it was thin and light.  Some people might find it bland, but I tend to under-season my own food when eating at home. So it was fine for me. The chipotle chicken crepe was alright as well.  The coffee definitely did not do it for me though. I love my coffee and I cannot start a day without a good cup of coffee. Unfortunately, my iced Americano was quite watered down. Yes, Americano is literally an espresso shot with water. But I can't justify paying $3.50 for an Americano that tastes like $1.99 iced coffee at timmys. 

What salvaged the experience was the dessert. We all quite enjoyed their swiss rolls. We tried both the pistachio and mocha swiss rolls. Both were made very well. The sponge cake to cream ratio was perfect. It was not heavy and not too sweet. 

I would probably come back for the dessert if anything. It is close by and it serves simple and health-ish savoury foods. If you are looking for a quick and light lunch with some tasty desserts, this would be a place for you."}
{"text":"Never disappoints!
I go there at least once every month.  Their pasteries are baked very well.  They don't have a lot of tables so it usually gets packed quickly."}
{"text":"Nice cozy place. I liked the seating on the 2nd floor. The waitress must get a killer workout everyday going up and down those steps to sever customers. 

Persian black tea $3 - served in a cute little teapot with a candle to keep it heated. Perfect for one person. I'm not big on tea's but it had a nice taste to it.

Cappuccino $4 - served in a little cup with strong coffee flavours. I needed a couple sugar cubes to bring it to a level at which I could enjoy. Once it was sweet enough for me it was amazing. I wish there was a larger size option.

Chocolate fondue $9.75 I think - came with a variety of fruits like blueberries, strawberries, raspberries and sliced banana. There was also 3 creme puffs and 3 marshmallows. The fruits were pretty fresh but the marshmallows were stale and hard. Of course anything tastes good when you dip it in chocolate.

Overall, everything was good but with an average review of 4.5 stars I was expecting something here to blow me away but nothing really did. Maybe I ordered the wrong items of the menu but still a great place to relax and to grab some snacks and drinks."}
{"text":"It is not just a cafe but a treat to your mouth. Their saffron tea tastes so fresh and pure and vanilla roulette is to die for. It is operated by Persian staff and their hospitality and serving is at par with any 5 star restaurant. Despite this the cafe is very affordable and a home to wide cafe menu, also bakery products like cakes, pastries and Persian sweets and dry fruits."}
{"text":"I like the cafe, it's a cozy place for socializing and it has good pastries .
The staff are very friendly too."}
{"text":"Went tonight for some tea and I wanted to try one of their delicious sounding salads. The spinach Brie and pear salad was delicious and very reasonably priced. Parking behind the restaurant was a plus for Yonge Street. Go if you have plenty of time to sit."}
{"text":"I *loooooveeeee* this cafe. Their pastries are so fresh. I came here on a Tuesday night, and it was just busy with customers. It has an area to sit and chat with your friend over a cup of tea or coffee. It's so cozy... the whole place is just cute. I love it. yum yum yum."}
{"text":"Had a piece of cheesecake and Americano from BB Cafe. Maybe I had really high expectations? By Yonge and Steeles, it's in a strip mall with a number of other Iranian joints, including a halal butcher shop and currency exchange. There's a parking lot on site so you don't have to worry about where to leave your car. With public transportation, it seems a little inconvenient to get to. Service was excellent; once we were finished, the staff asked us how we enjoyed our desserts. Back to the desserts; I found the cheesecake to be quite dry and a little expensive for what I got. The total came up to just under $10 with the cheesecake being $6. Anyway, this place is a-ok; they have a number of desserts (including Iranian treats) along with ice cream and nuts.

Good for: dessert, tea, coffee"}
{"text":"Esse pequeno lugar é realmente um achado. Pequenininho e não muito chamativo, é um lugar super confortável, agradável e de muito bom gosto. Os atendentes são atenciosos e educados.
Diversos tipos de sobremesa, bolachinhas, cookies, bolos, tortas. E tudo que provei, estava maravilhoso. Um sabor bem refinado, nada de exageros de açúcar.
A diversidade de bebidas quentes e geladas tbm, vários tipos de chá e café, ou misturados com leite.
Provei o chá da Pérsia, o tradicional. É um tipo de chá preto, muito gostoso e servido em um delicado bule, pendurado acima de uma pequena vela para mantê-lo aquecido, lindo.
Aqui minhas 5 estrelas, super recomendo! Amei!"}
{"text":"Trying a Persian cafe for the first time, I lucked out in choosing one of the better ones.

Pros:
Wide assortment of items
Ice cream is made on site

Cons:
Service can be slow

My GF had been wanting to try this place for the longest time.  We had the day off together so we gave this place a go.  I'm glad we did.  

This place has a really homey feel to it.  It feels like someone's home who coincidentally has lots of treats to serve.  They have a couple of one seat sofas on the first floor and much more seating on the second floor.  We sat ourselves on the second floor.  The lady working came up a few minutes later with menus.  There's a buzzer to call for her to come to the table.  We buzzed to order and it took her about 5 minutes to get up there because we could hear she wa with a customer downstairs.

My GF ordered the Persian tea and a slice of pomegranate cake.  I had the pistachio ice cream and a pear ice cream.  The Persian tea was pretty good.  It's set up on a neat apparatus above a candle.  The cake had lots of pomegranate pieces in there.  The pistachio ice cream was very good.  All their ice creams are made on site and you can taste the difference. I could only taste a little hint if any of pear in my iced tea but it was still enjoyable.  

The homey feel of this place gives a great atmosphere to come in and enjoy your time here.  The only gripe I have here is they only had one staff and she's multitasking both floors most of the time as well as being in the back area where the kitchen is.  We hit the buzzer to pay our bill and after 10 minutes, we just went down on our own to pay our bill.  When we got down, she was in the back area and didn't appear for another 5 minutes.  Granted, she was only one person, they should have at least a second if you're going to have 2 floors.  Maybe someone called in that day and we came on a day where they only had 1.

In the end, I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a nice little cafe to spend some time in."}
{"text":"We stopped by BB Cafe after dinner on a Saturday evening, arrived a bit after 8:30pm and we stayed until closing time. They have larger tables upstairs on the 2nd floor - took the corner table right next to the water dispenser filled with ice cold citrus infused water. 

Since it was our first time visiting the cafe, we asked for some recommendations. The person whom helped us pointed out some yummy looking suggestions.

We decided on a scoop of zaffron - pistachio ice cream that was fabulous with a distinctive taste that is heavenly. It might make your taste buds pleasantly surprised. 

Ice cream looks like a popular choice; I saw at least three orders of just the pomegranate ice cream. The server suggested having Faloudeh with ice cream ($8) and a few drops of lemon juice will make the taste even more authentic and traditional. The faloudeh had a unique texture and refreshing flavour but, I prefer having the ice cream alone.  

Tried both the large coffee ($4.50) and large vanilla cake rolls ($4.50). 
Both cake rolls were light and fluffy but, I found the vanilla to be too sweet. In contrast, to the mocha cake roll which was better because the mocha helped counter the sweetness. Definitely worth trying a bit of everything :)

The pistachio and pineapple cake was good, dense, full of flavour and just right amount of sweetness ($7.50). While I did not order any of their teas, our friends order the perfectly pear tea and said it was very light and delicate taste. From that description, I will try to find a fruit or floral tea that have a stronger and bolder taste. 

I think these desserts would be a good accompaniment to a sugar free beverage. A small bite of the cake then follow up with a sip of their many tea leaf offerings.

Good portions to share with other people. Overall, lovely atmosphere, service was attentive and friendly. I will definitely visit them again!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a Thursday night. Place itself is a small family-run shop with a lot of different pastries cookies and treats around the store. My friend and I got a cake to ourselves which came to about $13 including tip. I got a hazelnut chocolate mousse cake while my friend got a molten lava chocolate cake! Both were very delicious but I found the molten lava cake bit too chocolatey for my preference but still overall yummy! Would definitely come back again, the service was very good and the staff working there were very nice and helpful. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Service could be better but their desserts are AMAZING. Light and fragrant, I think I'm hooked on Persian sweets! Presentation and atmosphere is comfortable and cozy. Was so good we bought some more to go :)"}
{"text":"I love the cozy setting of  this lovely cafe which is located at Yonge and north of Major Mac. The staffs there are very friendly. At first, I didn't know there are extra seating on the second floor; thought this cafe is too small and about to sit at the bar. Later, the staff invited me to the second floor, it is like a little playhouse at the loft. Their Tiramisu is good, not too sweet, goes great with espresso. I had ordered a Walnut and Cinnamon Apple crepe,  I love it :)"}
{"text":"I like this place. What is important to me is done well here. The pastry is fresh, delicious but not tooo sweet and looks great. Also the cafe is very clean. Also, the outside is clean. So many restaurants let the trash outside stand which is disgusting, but not these guys"}
{"text":"I've only stayed in the other location on Yonge Street (@ Finch), but I've gotten coffee/desserts to-go at this newer location.  There are only a few tables, but despite being right off of Yonge, the inside is nice, quiet, 'n cozy!

Got an Americano it was alright.  I seemed to have to add all the milks/cream that was provided in the small bowl.  Got a Neopolitan-type dessert with custard filling and it was really good.  Not too sweet.

This particular location is much, much easier to access if you're heading North.  Otherwise, forget about it unless it's during off-hours.

Parking:  Directly behind the small house-looking café, on the South-side.  DO NOT park at the other plaza just North of it 'cause apparently they ticket 'n tow."}
{"text":"I was in this area, running an errand, so I sorta had to plan my stay in this unfamiliar part of town.  When BB Café came up on Yelp, I knew I had to visit since there aren't such places in Mississauga!  

Starbucks, Tim Horton's, Second Cup?  Yes, tons.  Demetre's?  Gross, h.s., but unfortunately, yes.  Independent, ethnic cafés that serve desserts?  Not so much.

When I stepped in, I was sorta worried that there wouldn't be a place to sit 'cause most of the tables were occupied.  The unoccupied table had no chairs.  However, we lucked out 'cause a group decided to vacate.

There was a large-ish counter with various desserts:  cakes, puff pastries, shortbread cookies, as well as an assortment of stuff on top of the counter.  The friendly ladies asked if we were doing a take-out or dining in.  We said dining in and they said to have a seat, they'd bring a menu.  Eventually, our table was cleaned and menus were brought.

Our group of 3 shared a large pot of Persian Tea ($3.99) which tasted like Earl Gray.  Large pot was probably more suitable for 2 people X 2 teacups each.  

We ordered a Custard Napoleon ($3.99) which was perfect for 2ppl.  Custard tasted like sweetened butter, so if you wanted something lighter, opt for the cream filled napoleon.  Other friend ordered a plate of Zoolbia Bamiyeh (~$4).  

I don't know who \"borrowed\" from whom, but they were reminiscent of an Indian dessert, Jalebi.  The Bamiyeh was sorta like a stumpy churro with syrup on it instead of cinnamon/sugar.  I preferred the Persian version of Jalebi 'cause it was finer and not as greasy.  Plate was good for sharing, it would probably be a bit much for 1 person.

I found the overall atmosphere very relaxing.  Waitstaff was nice and offered to answer any questions.  Losta people came in/out, doing takeout of cake-sized boxes of stuff.  And at the checkout, the male owner (??), asked how everything was, and said that they were opening a larger location at Yonge/Major Mac.

Would definitely stop by again if I was in the area!

Tip:  Even though it's on Yonge, DON'T worry, there is a private lot for all you drivers!!!"}
{"text":"Upstairs is pretty cozy and private, really good for study or meeting up with friends. The herbal tea wasnt too special, but their deserts are ok."}
{"text":"The chocolate cake is awesome! If you have a bd or an event, try their chocolate cake. The tea pot is pricy as the tea is not higher quality tea. Persian pastries are pricy compared to some other places in the same plaza, but the quality is good."}
{"text":"This is a very cute Persian cafe. The Persian tea is delicious and comes with 3 types of sugar cubes/chunks: white, brown (?) and saffron-infused. I loved the saffron ones.

Also got a cream puff with icing sugar, which was a tiny fluff of pastry with a dollop of custard filling. Tasty and the perfect size if you're full from dinner or on a diet but still want a lil some' some'.

Very affordable. Came to around $5. Very cute. Lots of desserts to choose from but I didn't try any of the other ones as they looked a bit too filling for me. Lots of traditional Persian foods if you're into that. The ladies were sweet and friendly.

FIY if you just want to buy Persian desserts and don't care to sit and enjoy in the cafe, next door (which smells like burning) seems to bake them all there."}
{"text":"The servers were really friendly and really attentive for when you need anything from them.

My friends and I were there to try out their real Persian teas and it was made beautifully. It comes with a candle and a teapot. 

Their cakes look absolutely amazing and its also super affordable. 

Their food is freshly made and you can make special requests without it being extra expensive to change their menu. 


Definitely recommending it to anyone who wants to just have a simple tea time with their friends."}
{"text":"Service - cold service. No one greeted me even though a few staffs are at the counter.

Food - really meh... the raspberry pistachio cake was stale and full of artifical flavour... worst cake I had. When I got home, I saw the cake actually cracked open on the side; I am not sure how long the cake had been in the display. How could the staff sold me the stale cake. 

The cake roll was okay. I had a much better roll elsewhere.

I will never return."}
{"text":"So nice! Flavourful traditional tea. Cozy seating upstairs. The traditional tea comes with candles to keep your tea warm. Perfect spot for a date. I think it'd be even nicer in the winter can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and it was a very delightful experience. I'd say it's one of those hidden gems in Vaughan/Richmond Hill area, as my friends and I have never heard of it before. The desserts were delicious, we highly recommend the Cafe Glacé with ice cream in it! Fondue was also very yummy. The place is very cute and cozy, especially the upper floor! Ice cream flavours are very unique and to be honest I wasn't a big fan of them but all the other desserts were great. Would definitely come again but more for the quiet and calm atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not good. Expected a cafe to serve good expresso drinks. But what I got was a water down version. I ordered a mocha, taste was not even close. Tasted water down. The milk with water was filled 3/4 and the expresso was on top. The other cup was an Americano. No coffee flavor what so ever. If you want to operate a cafe, please make good expresso."}
{"text":"Great ambiance... Very relaxing and soothing cafe... Desserts are mouth watering... Must try pistachio pineapple cake... Traditional tea is very flavor full.. friendly service..top notch"}
{"text":"This place is great for Persian pastry fans. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly.
They gave us a sample of cake yazdi. They have tons of customers every day, so you can be sure their pastry is fresh! There's also a variety of honey at the back that you can purchase."}
{"text":"This little gem was an amazing visit on a Saturday. We didn't have a chance to try all of their goods, but I'll definitely be back. The severs were nice and all the coffees, teas, food were all plated beautifully. 


DEFINITELY TRY THE SAFFRON-PISTACHIO ice cream!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks here are quite good, however, service is incredibly slow.  There is also very limited parking as it is situated in old-richmond hill."}
{"text":"We are always on the lookout for new delivery places for our lunchtime cravings. We were excited to see a café on beyondmenu.com, we were really looking to mix it up instead of having Chinese or Jimmy Johns yet again so we were willing to pay the ridiculous delivery fee of $3.00

I wish I could say we had a good experience, but that just wasn't the case.

The website said delivery times were 30-45 minutes so at 60 minutes I was calling to see where our food was, but no one answered my phone calls. Finally, our receptionist told me our food was here. I went to get it and she explained that it had been delivered 20 minutes before hand but they didn't have a name on the order so they had to leave, go look up the name, and then call her with it. This means our hot food was no longer hot. I am pretty sure the food would be excellent but my cold and congealed omelet didn't do it for me. 

Because there was an $18  minimum for delivery, we ordered a $3 side of potato salad to cover the difference between our meals. I wish I could tell you how that was, but it wasn't delivered and again when I tried to call there was no answer. 

So to recap the 1 star score: Over an hour to deliver, they don't bring the name of the order, cold food, missing food, no answer of the phone when there are issues. 

Maybe the BB stands for Bad Bad?

8/20: As an update someone did call from BB Café and talk about waiving a delivery (whatever that means) to make up for the bad experience, but the first impression with this one is sticking around. Had there only been one issue, maybe a second chance would be given, but I am not changing my mind on this one. It was too many issues."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd location of the popular BB Cafe in North York. I have so much faith in this cafe as I even recommend my friend to visit even before I have a chance to come here.

It is a step up from their Original location. Nicer deco, More spacious and even more seating! 

Get the Persian Black Tea ($3). The presentation and the cute looking cup and teapot really enhanced my experience! 

Get the Rollet ($3.50). My Vanilla Pistachio roll was just so good. 

Get the Saffron and Rosewater Ice Cream ($3.50) to go. Oh so Creamy!

OK, just get everything... they even have a whole cake!

Free wifi access but seems there are not too many electric outlets on the ground floor. 

Free parking behind the building, the entrance is just south of the cafe.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"BB Cafe is one of the numerous Persian cafe in the area, but it is definitely one of the best one for set up.

Airy, clean and with comfortable seating if you do decide to stay in for a cup of tea.

A pot of tea ($2.49) on kept warm by a tea candle and a piece of Neapolitan custard cake ($3.99) is perfect combination for a leisure afternoon tea experience!

There are numerous other pastries on display which I wish they have descriptions and prices on them. Especially good for customers like me that are not really sure which is which!

If you are not into pastry, there is also Saffron ice cream and Faloodeh to choose from or you can even order both of them just like my friend did!

Service is excellent and friendly. Just order at the counter and have a seat and your yummy dessert would be delivered to your table!"}
{"text":"I like rich desserts.  Flash news: they are desserts; they are not supposed to be good for your waist line.  Just give me the real deal.  And BB Cafe does not disappoint.  The cheesecake was creamy and rich.  The chocolate roll cake was not too sweet.  The plating was exquisite.  The chef's attention to details showed, as well as the pride.  The server answered our questions patiently and politely.  Her knowledge in the goods showed.

BB Cafe also sells sandwiches, panini, crepes and waffles for lunches and dinners.

The decor is classy.  The seating at ground floor is too close, as our neighbours eavesdropped on our conversation."}
{"text":"Delicious ice creams and cake. Wonderful atmosphere. The people who work there and very friendly. It's a nice atmosphere too. Definitely recommend it, especially if you want to try out Iranian desserts."}
{"text":"Friendly staff,average prices for a breakfast place. I like trying new places and this place is close to home, I got the sausage egg and cheese croissant and the biscuits and gravy.the sandwich only had a few cut up pieces of sausage they must not have sausage patties.the biscuits were good but the gravy tasted watery and had no sausage in it that you can taste or see.I was hoping to find another great breakfast place but unfortunately I was not very satisfied with the food and I will continue to go to hoosier cafe and biscuits"}
{"text":"Cozy little place for desserts or a quick bite to eat if your in the area. 
They have soup, salad, sandwiches, and savoury crepes available. We didn't try these savoury options.
My review is based on sit in dessert experience. 
Mocha drink was delish and nicely presented. Cake slices are around $5-6 each. It's a small place with just a few tables. Service was friendly. 

Will be back when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this Persian cafe. The seating is very comfortable and I like they put on some relaxing piano music. 
However, as they don't have many tables, sometimes I am not able to get a table there. 


The persian tea is a must. When I feel like to have dessert, I usually get the mocha rolls. yum yum. 

They have another location at Yonge and major mac which has more seating space as it has 2 levels. I like it there too. However it is a bit far for me, but whenever I am in the neighborhood, I definitely go."}
{"text":"I am curious with the very polarized reviews, as I am on the low range with 2/5 stars. This place at the time had 4-5 stars when we decided to go, and we were disappointed with our experience.

Service was one of my notable bad experiences I've ever had. We weren't greeted. We had to wait for someone to seat us for over 5 minutes even though there was an employee standing right there. He did not notify the server and he didn't greet us either. It was very unwelcoming and had an unfriendly vibe. After seating us on the second floor, we scoured the menu and decided to order the fondue, a shaved ice, and a sundae. Service was slow and it took forever for her to bring us stuff and after delivering our food, we never saw her again until we went downstairs to pay our bill (because we knew she wouldn't come back to check on us).

The desserts were interesting. I've never had Persian sweets before so I'm not sure if it's my tastebuds or my lack of understanding, but it was subpar, had small portions, and a little pricey for me.

To conclude, I would not come back again and I do not recommend it. The only positives is that it had wifi and the decor was comfy. 2/5."}
{"text":"Wonderful ambiance with a wide selection of desserts. If you like Persian tea and coffee this is the place to come. 
We had the walnut banana cake and the raspberry cheesecake! We sat and leisurely enjoyed Supping coco! I did not get to try the upstairs but that us just one more reason to come back! 
Enjoy"}
