{"text":"This is a brand new eatery in our growing community of Estrella. First off, I have been there twice in the past 10 days and was served very good food as was TheHubby. The setting is beautiful, the seating areas are comfortable and varied, the beer and wine selection is well thought out and just different from every other taps locally filled. Mixed drinks are available and something is on special every day of the week.  I highly recommend you go and eat here. I highly recommend you bring your patience and your happy pants. This place just opened and is getting their sea legs under them. It will get faster, give them a minute- but the food is worth the wait- unless you are hangry- in that case go elsewhere- but not out McDonalds up inEstrella, their wait time is longer and the food is subpar."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! The food is really good and my girls love the pizza! Such a bonus that you can order food and take it down to the pool! The Mango Margarita is amazing! Also try the French dip. Live music and great views make this a must when people come to visit. The staff is so friendly even making special kiddo drinks for my daughters. Matt and Rena are the best! Best food in Estrella by far!"}
{"text":"The nachos were dry and hard to get down. Seems like they drove to Safeway and picked up the bare minimum to make crap nachos. This is not worth $8 in any way shape or form. Took 10 minutes to get us water and it was mostly ice... I do not recommend this restaurant unless you're down to get dry food stuck in a throat lubricated by hard ice."}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed I guess I am bit complicated, old school I pizza-talking it was to hard to pick one pizza because they are all weird flavors personal opinion I was happier with the NYPD place, so I definitely wont go back for pizza, service and bar were great."}
{"text":"What a treat!  This is the best pizza I have had since moving to Arizona, it reminds me of the pizza I grew up with in the Northwest.  Thank you!  I can't wait to try other things on the menu, what a wonderful selection! As a brand new place the owner and staff were working hard to provide the best customer service, with more experience for the staff this will be the best place to eat nearby!!  Thanks again!!"}
{"text":"We have only been here once, but we are happy to have this place open in Estrella. Friendly employees and a great atmosphere. The daily specials are nice to have also."}
{"text":"First visit at Casa Del Mar at the Presidio this afternoon. A group of 9 of us arrived at 3:00 as they were opening. Waiter was very friendly and helpful selecting food and drinks. Our 2 hour and 15 minutes visit was excellent - good food & drinks - definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Another great night at CDM! Taco Tuesday is awesome! Our server was Destinee and she was right on the money... great service, friendly server and outstanding food. Had a great time!"}
{"text":"As a long time pizza maker, eater and pizza lover,  I highly recommend  Casa Del Mar!  I agree with the other patrons, great crust and the toppings are VERY GENEROUS!  The center of the crust is well cooked, which is something many shops fail. Their centers get soggy, NOT the case with Casa. Try their Philly Cheese steak pizza. I think it's called the Jersey Special.  Please give them a try. Very convenient too!  Dick Bond."}
{"text":"Friend of mine took the family out here, didn't know what to expect but,the pizza is really good, reminds me of a cross between Chicago deep dish and New York thin crust.For the taste it's good not like alot that taste like cardboard."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night and was very pleased. The pizza (Gone Coastal) was very good. We also ordered the Giant Soft Pretzel which was delicious. The wait staff was very friendly and accommodating. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just what our beautiful community needed. Service was still getting figured out but our waitress worked hard to ensure we had a good experience. Food was delicious. I had the pizza which was very good. Wife had a salad which she loved. Menu is extensive which gives us many choices for the next times we return. Full bar is also a nice compliment. We will be going back shortly."}
{"text":"My wife and I consider ourselves pizza aficionados.... we moved here from the Seattle Tacoma area where pizza is king!!  Ok, we bow to Chicago and New York... but those are two distinct styles, unlike what we're used to in the PNW!!  Tonight we were entertained at the soft opening of Casa del Mar in Goodyear, Ariz.... more specifically at Presidio in Estrella Mountain Ranch!!  This pizza was beyond imagination.... the pepperoni was incredible and plentiful... spicy, yet not greasy!! Second pizza was Italian sausage, chicken, pineapple and jalapenos!!  I can't even say the words that can aptly describe the deliciousness!!  Casa del Mar pizza ranks as the best pizza we've had since moving here in 2011.  This includes stops at places like Oregano's, Barro, Spinato's, Lou Malnatti's, and la pizza Al forno!!  Also a great beer selection on tap, headlined by Elysian Space Dust IPA out of Seattle, WA!!  This place is worth the drive across the Valley floor!!  Will definitely be back for my pizza fix!!"}
{"text":"Deliciousness!  Staff was friendly and attentive.  Food came out tinely and was the appropriate temperature.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great location,phenomenal views and of course, you can't go without the two dollar mimosas on Sunday"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful addition to the Estrella Mountain Ranch community. It's a lovely, cozy caf√© with interesting and delicious menu options including lighter fare. We go at least weekly."}
{"text":"AMAZING pizza!! Pizzas come LOADED with fresh toppings and the crust is so tasty that it's never left over like at other places. I've tried an assortment of salads, wraps, pizzas, and even fish n' chips from this location and they have all been absolutely delicious. Cocktails are yummy and super affordable. The last time I was there they had live music on the patio - so nice!   Highly recommend giving it a try! Well worth the drive out to Estrella!"}
{"text":"I love desserts.  They have  a cookie with ice cream on top yummy. My daughter and I enjoyed the cheese pizza."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food.  Service had definitely improved as expected.  Scenery is a plus.  I enjoy the sandwiches and wraps as they are very tasty and delicious.  Great job.  Matt is always a friendly and courteous server and always treats us like friends.  Go check it out.  Joe"}
{"text":"Had a reservation for a group of 11.  Tables weren't ready & it was a trial to get a drink.  Placed our food order well before others at our table.  After 1  1/2 hours, no food.  Everyone else on the entire patio had been served.  2nd drink order was also dropped & took forever; had to ask for water 4 times.  Waiter never noticed/commented on our lack of food.  But understandable as the he was busy expounding on his political affiliation & stance on gun control.  Guess that wore him out because he felt the need to sit at a nearby table to take that party's order.  We walked on our drink order - have never done that, but no way was I paying for that fiasco.  No clue if the food is any good and will never return to find out."}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly staff. Prices were great. We had the taco special on Tuesday and the food was great for the price. We saw lots of delicious looking food come out to other tables that we can't wait to try."}
{"text":"Eh, don't know what all the hype is about this place. Rather eat at many other places for this type of food. Have to say the building atmosphere is nice though."}
{"text":"Try the Calzone it was terrific had mine loaded with spinach,sausage and mushroom.Drinks were good service was great and enjoyed live music out on the patio.Welcome to our community.Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"This is hands-down the best restaurant in Estrella Mountain Ranch.  Their pizzas are amazing!  We enjoy eating the Barnacle Pizza and the Mediterranean Sea Pizza are our favorites.  Much better pizza than any place we've had in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great place to meet up with friends.  We've only been there once, but we will be back!  Food and drinks priced fairly and served quickly and tasty too."}
{"text":"Pepperoni stuffed pizza is amazing! Really good service and reasonable pricing. Loved it!"}
