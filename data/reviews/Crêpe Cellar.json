{"text":"Seriously? This restaurant has 4 crepe options on the menu for dinner.  Totally disappointed. The spinach and mushroom crepe was delicious but it was the only vegetarian option.  Call me crazy, but with a name like \"Crepe Cellar\" I imagined several options...

The tap beers are a sampling of the UK... Which is great but the best local brews are a block away.

The atmosphere is nice.  We sat at the bar.  My hubs had the fish and chips, which he enjoyed.  We skipped dessert.  MIght be a better option for brunch?"}
{"text":"Love this place. Everyone is friendly. The food is good. I like the savory crepes. Came here for brunch one Sunday and the coffee was great too!"}
{"text":"When you are in the mood for crepes in charlotte this is the place to go. Tasty diner specials and salads for those that are looking for more than crepes. thumbs up on service."}
{"text":"Good food, coffee done right, and an eclectic wine selection. I've only had brunch, but based on that deliciousness, dinner will be close behind. 

If you're going on the weekend, there may be a little (worthwhile) wait."}
{"text":"Great wines by the glass, great onion soup, steak frites and crepes.  Lots of tasty stuff on the menu and a cute dicey spot."}
{"text":"Never eaten anything but dessert here, but the bananas foster crepe is great"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for brunch today and got the sweet Nutella crepe with strawberries and bananas. Very large serving (I use cafe monte's tiny crepes as my standard to measure against) and reasonably priced. No line for brunch and waitress was cheerful and efficient. Crepe was delicious and the powdered sugar on top was a nice finish. We both left full and happy."}
{"text":"Came in for dessert late on a Saturday and Holy Crepes! I couldn't even finish mine. It was so creamy and rich and full of flavor. Want to go back for dinner sometime but be prepared for a wait in NoDa."}
{"text":"So my review is based on their specialties - Crepes. The Queen City crepe is my favorite, must try it. Portions are large, you get full with half of one...and the other half make for great leftovers!!  The fries are deliciously condimented. My favorite place in NoDa.

FYI - Crepe is a french word, so it's typically mispronounced. It's not \"creype\". The first e is pronounced as in \"bed\" - \"Crehpe\"."}
{"text":"This is a charming neighborhood restaurant in NoDa. The burger here is soooo good that I actually dreamed about it! In my dream, the burger was floating by me on a tray! Lol 

I also love the mussels! There's a different preparation each day and its always delicious. The place can get crowded on the weekends, but its worth it. I like to browse the local shops/boutiques while I wait. The restaurant will text you when your table is ready."}
{"text":"Nice staff.  Decent drinks.  Good ham and cheese crepe.  Very crowded and small.  But no one seemed rushed.  I'd try it again.  I do not recommend the onion soup.  Little cheese, chewy \"croutons\" and little onion.  Seemed a little oily too.  So do something else.. I will be trying the steak and mushroom pie next time.  See if it is really as good as you can get in the UK :)"}
{"text":"We were visiting from Chicago and decided to check this place out.
The buffalo oysters were awesome!  We also enjoyed the brie and pesto fries and of course the crepes.  We shared the nutella and strawberry crepe for dessert and we all loved it.
definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"So after a string of realy good meals in Charlotte lately, I was significantly underwhelmed  by a Saturday night meal at Crepe Cellar. Underwhelmed is probably too nice...because it wasn't for the stellar fried cod...the place sucked. Five dishes - French Onion Soup, sauteed garlic shrimp, house salad (mixed greens with crostini and red wine vinagrette), fish and chips and shrimp and grits.
 
French Onion soup...this was like dishwater except dishwater has more flavor...theme for the night was \"we don't care if we flavor our food). How do you mess this old school classic up? You can even use beef bouillon cubes and throw some decent gruyere and crostini in and salvage it...I have never had to salt, salt and salt my French Onion Soup...they need to learn a lesson from Captial Grille or Lulu in this department...not off to good start.
 
Sauteed shrimp...this was supposed to be like the Cajun Queen version...except Cajun Queen knows how to do bbq shrimp...granted there's is over the top with garlic and butter, but isn't that what you expect from this type of dish? Once again my dad (who, keep in mind, is 75 and usually eats at places like Pier 51 at 5:30PM with my mom...and considers Dragonfly a fancy place) and I are both searching for the salt shaker...for \"New Orleans\" bbq shrimp!!!! You know when you can look at a shrimp and see that it's best days were probably 3 months ago when they froze it??? They were decent size sauteed shrimp at one time, but freezer burn and time took their toll...at least I could tell they were pre-BP...probably Vietnamese tiger shrimp (2 for one Harris Teeter), but I digress. That's what these shrimp looked like - I was worried about the shimp being off more than I was them being flavorless...but they were a pretty good combination of both. The brothy goodness you would expect from this was basically a version of their French Onion soup broth/with UNSALTED butter. Then to add insult to injury, their bread was some Le Brea knock-off that wasn't even toasted to hide the staleness!
 
House salad - mixed greens with red wine vinagrette...can we move on? How do you ruin a mixed green salad? I don't know...ask the chef at Crepe Cellar.
 
Shrimp and Grits - I wasn't really excited about getting this after my bbq shrimp, but the waitress insisted this was the best thing on the menu (I give her the skunk-eye at this point...and thank her for another Jack and Diet). We ask for a larger salt shaker in anticipation...The shrimp were at least from a different batch than the sauteed boys...overdone - probably finished in the grits for too long. The tasso gravy needed salt. Let me pause for a wikpedia entry: 
 
Tasso ham is a specialty of Cajun cuisine. It is a spicy, peppery version of smoked pork made from the shoulder butt. In this case, \"ham\" is a misnomer, since tasso is not made from the hind leg of a pig. This cut is typically fatty and, because the muscle is constantly used by the animal, has a great deal of flavor. The butt, which will weigh 7 to 8 pounds, is sliced across the grain into pieces about 3 in / 7.5 cm thick. These are dredged in a salt cure, which usually includes nitrates and sugar. The meat is left to cure briefly, only three or four hours, then rinsed, rubbed with a spice mixture containing Cayenne pepper and garlic, and hot-smoked until cooked through.
 
Grits weren't good either, but I'm past that now...
 
Fish and Chips...basically beer battered cod and curly fries...savior of the meal. Beautifully done piece of cod...flaky, flavorful and held it's texture nicely. Fried just right, not too airy, actually a little crisp with the batter...would agree w/ their menu assessment from Charlotte magazine saying it's the best...especially since they can't compare to Big Ben's anymore. Fries were like anywhere else's...at least the ketchup was salty. 

I guess I was just shocked based on other experiences/reviews on Yelp.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Why, oh why, does this place have so many stars?

I visited tonight and I split the Brie fries, spinach and mushroom crepe and the spinach poached pears salad.

First let me rewind, I ordered the Hendricks cocktail.  I normally don't like gin but this was delicious!  It was super sophisticated and great for the summer.  My only regret was not ordering another.

Unfortunately it went downhill then settled on a bland plateau for the rest of the meal.

Fries-honestly still not sure what I think.  I'd like to pick the brain of whoever created this dish.  I can't say I hated it but I also can't say I loved it.  It was just a strange combination.  The Brie and pesto also wasn't well distributed, it was mainly on top.  Dip the fries in ketchup and they are just as addictive as regular fries.

Spinach/mushroom crepe- bland, bland, bland.  It tasted exactly like it sounded.  I tried to add salt but destroyed my crepe in the process so I just gave up and ate it.

Salad- again, lackluster.  The shallot dressing was very nice but definitely not hard to execute.  Everything else on the salad was whatevs.  Oh yes, it came with 4 small (overcooked) shrimp for an extra 3.50.  Not the best deal but you do what you gotta do for protein.  

I just don't get the appeal of this place.  I tasted the other meals at my table and they were all bland as well (stay away from the pesto pasta-not worth the calories). 

Just a note: the service was really good and our waitress was friendly and on top of things.  Our table loved her!  Good job Crepe Cellar management."}
{"text":"The arugula and fig salad had a light and delicious dressing, but \"one\" small fig sliced on the salad really... The mahi mahi meal was good but small.  The mussels were terribly gritty, had no seasoning what so ever, and the sauce had no flavor.  95 dollars for good to mediocre food, before the tip, and starving when we left. Very disappointed and won't be back."}
{"text":"Awesome Brie fries are to die for. Crepes were just good, nothing great. Freshly made, good ingredients, and tastes just nothing really outstanding. The Queen City crepe was tasty, the daily special crepe not so much. 

They have daily specials on both beer wine and food. Only seats about 80 max, but is cozy, not crowded.  

We would probably go back, but order different things."}
{"text":"Good solid soups, although their French onion is a little bit too sweet. I stopped in just for a second, but for sure will be back

I love how flavorful their turkey bacon soup was. It was sure hardy. Also a fan of how their soup of the day always changes. 

The server was smart and answered questions about local beers and distiled alcohols. Great place for drinks!"}
{"text":"3.5 really, but I put 4 for the wife who liked it more.

A nice atmosphere, maybe a touch trendy, but not in an epicenter sort of way.  Very dark.  When we got there it was packed and quite loud, but we got a table right away.  The bar was full as well.

The service was good, almost too attentive, and very upbeat. My wife would say that I am a grouch for saying that.  It did take a while to get to us once we sat down, but it was very crowded, and after that it was quite quick, and the food was very prompt.

They have a very nice selection of beers on tap, and we loved the Chimay and triple strong amber ale that we had.  For food, I had the fish and chips and my wife had a crepe with brie.  The sides were excellent I thought.  I loved the fries and the sauteed spinach that came with my wifes dish, and the purple slaw was good as well.  My wife loved her crepe, but my fish was rather insipid.  it was well cooked, just flavorless.  Maybe a bit too airy in the battering?    

Prices were fine. Neither particularly high or low."}
{"text":"Delicious. Devine. Delectable.  And coffee in little french presses!  Yay.  Get one of everything."}
{"text":"This place is great in general I'm only giving it four stars because they said that they had the best fish and chips and I would disagree however their pastas are great fries are great they're dessert crapes are great their salads are awesome and their drinks are on point - in terms of savory crapes I've only tried the Queen city which my kids really enjoy but my husband's favorite is the pasta dish - I would definitely continue going here and recommend others to give it a whirl"}
{"text":"Chicken Cassoulet is outstanding.  Love the brussel sprouts and drinks too.  Laid back casual.  Great for a date or to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Best Restaurant in NoDa by far.

I really enjoy their burger, which is AMAZING, and their Fish n' Chips- equally amazing.   Everything they make is taste, and clean (in spite of being quite heavy).  Both of these meals are quite reasonably priced, by the way.  If you stick with either of these, you'll be happy.

I've had some not-so-great stuff there as well.   Their truffle brie french fries sounded amazing, but were very disappointing.  Also their dessert crepes were nothing special.

Service is fast.  Staff is polite and professional.

I haven't had a chance to fully explore their menu- it is definitely hit or miss.

The management is great.   On time my fish was a bit undercooked.  I asked them to just heat it up a bit more.   Instead they scrapped the whole thing and brought me a brand new plate- no charge, and offered to throw in a free dessert.   Super nice of them.  And I want to note, that this was the one and ONLY time that anything I ordered from them was less than perfectly prepared.

I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Trendy, popular spot in NoDA (Charlotte art district). Pepper and sausage crepe with purple (!) cole slaw purple very good.
Charcuterie appetizer kinda small for $12, but had great olives that I had never had before and they had no pits!  Generous side salad
Mushroom spinach crepe goat cheese so so according to one of fellow diners. Good service.  Very popular so go early before Gallery Crawl. We parked in the YMCA lot for free."}
{"text":"I've never met a meal at Crepe Cellar that I haven't liked... Or a server.

When I'm aiming to impress an out-of-town friend - or an unaware Charlotte friend - I always take them to Crepe Cellar. There was a time in my life when I was here once a week. Granted, I live right up the street, but my frequent visits were more about the experience than the convenience. 

My menu favorites --
Starters: Pesto Brie French Fries
Savory Crepes: Spinach & Wild Mushroom, Queen City, Turkey & Brie
Sandwiches: Crepe Cellar Burger
Sweet Crepes: Bananas Foster, Nutella & Bananas (Add Strawberries!)

Add a side of melt-in-your-mouth mac & cheese for $1.50. Worth every penny. 

Because Crepe doesn't take reservations, as they are an intimate setting (which I hope never changes), you should plan to get there early on a weekend night to compete with the crowd. Can't get a table? Let Chris take care of you at the bar."}
{"text":"I've written a review on Crepe before, but I have to write another on new menu items:

Two new appetizers that are off the chain and GLUTEN FREE!

The Oysters NoDA! Friggin awesome!  6 large oysters baked with Brie, spinach and a slice of ham!  $11

Lastly, the Mushroom Vegan Terrine!  It's a mushroom pâté and make sure you ask for GLUTEN FREE crackers to spread it on.   Came with baby gherkins and spicy mustard! $8

You seriously eat these as a meal and be full.  

Awesome job again Crepe!  

As always, Catherine rocked behind the bar.

Thanks Crepe!"}
{"text":"I can not say enough good things about Crepe Cellar's burger and pesto brie fries. I go at least once a month for this meal and have never been disappointed. 

Some french pressed coffee with their brunch is one of my favorite ways to spend a Sunday morning after yoga."}
{"text":"My first time there and it was a pleasant change . The food , ambience and service was great. 

Had the Chicken Po Boy sandwich , it had  great flavor and taste. 

Followed up with a chocolate banana crepe which was pretty good. A little dry but Nutella makes things taste better."}
{"text":"We love this place. Having it right down the street is incredible. We have tried almost everything and it keeps getting better each time. Love ! My favorite spot in Charlotte for a delicious meal."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I ate lunch here after taking suggestions from Yelp on where to eat. We were looking for a new spot. We work very near the Noda area, so it sent us to the Crepe Cellar.   Just like every other Noda eatery, this place was urban cool and eclectic. Hip music, minimalist motif, waitresses all in black. Kind of looked like they were trying to be fine dining on a budget.   They might have pulled it off, too, except for the gravy stains on our waitress's shirt. As is my habit, I asked her which was better - a crepe dish or the fish and chips that was voted as \"Charlotte's Best\".  She replied, \"Go with the fish and chips.  Our entree crepes are just so-so\". Brutally honest but suicidal at the same time. Perfect. 

She was dead on. My fish and chips was great. Light and juicy with just the right amount of crunch in the battered outside. A GREAT sweet red slaw accompanied the cod. Decent fries, too. My partner had the same thing and was equally impressed. 

She had added (during her per-meal analysis) that the dessert crepes were \"to die for\" so we added a shared $8 Crepe Suzette to our meal. Buttermilk crepes with a good sized scoop of butter rum ice cream .... And all of this swimming in a rum sauce. Very good, but I certainly wouldn't die for it. Not for 8 bucks, anyway. 

All in all, a good meal. The biggest disappointment was when we got the check. Nearly $45 with tip. Pretty steep lunch - even for hip Noda!"}
{"text":"Hands down my fave place to go for date night or birthday celebration. I adore the food. The pesto fries are amazing. The fish specials are so yummy. I've also split a flat bread pizza - those are great too. We actually ended up there one night with the kid and it even worked out. They were super fast to get everything out. Seating is limited but cozy. Oh, get the nutella crepe wrapped brownie. SO GOOD."}
{"text":"Not something I regularly do, but I had such a good experience I wanted to share. We went out for a date at the Crepe Cellar in NoDa last night. It was a great atmosphere and we were having great time, but it seemed to be taking while for our main course to arrive. Our waitress came out and apologized that the kitchen had overcooked my steak and they were cooking me a new one and that she had talked to the manager and our entire meal and drinks were on the house. We were really surprised that they were so proactive and that they covered everything. They brought us out desert and kept offering free drinks/ coffee etc all on the house.

And the food was AWESOME. Every dish was just great.
So if you are looking for a great place for a date and are near NoDa I highly recommend it. Please share with friends"}
{"text":"We had a small wedding in April and came to Crepe Cellar for dinner after with our families. The food was delicious, and service was attentive. Everyone enjoyed both the appetizers and the main courses (even the picky eaters!)."}
{"text":"Best brussels sprouts I have had in my life. I know...that does not sound all that exciting, but there were amazing. I think it these could convert any brussels sprout hater to a fan. The buckwheat crepes were also very good as was the pesto pasta dish. There really seemed to be something appealing for all tastes on the menu. Looking forward to going back. It's hard to get in though past 6pm on a Friday or Saturday - the restaurant is small and they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"Pretty relaxed, on the trendier side for Charlotte. Service was slow/a little inattentive and food just OK. We got salads that had interesting combinations of ingredients (ie green apples, endive, goat cheese, candied almonds) but were a bit on the small side and nothing amazing. Good wine selection. Martini was OK and probably worth the $7. Would try something else in the NoDa area next time."}
{"text":"The first best thing about Crepe Cellar Kitchen & Pub is that their primary food offering comes in some form of crepe, which is the best food delivery vessel in existence. Sweet or savory, they are a thing of taste bud glory, especially when they are done well.

The second best thing about Crepe Cellar is that the service and food quality is consistently excellent, whether for a large group of boozy women, an intimate dinner date, or with the family for Mother's Day Brunch, in the middle of which your baby may or may not have spit up on the floor. Perhaps it was an opinion on the oddity of judgment that Mac & Cheese is no longer served at Sunday Brunch. Special thanks to the staff who was completely gracious and sanitary about assisting in clean up. But, for real, why no Mac & Cheese at Sunday Brunch like back in the day?

Crepe Cellar is gauzily lit and cozy, just as a crepe eatery should be. However, since it is on the small side and they don't take reservations, it is best to get there early, or expect to belly up their comely bar.  Once seated at a table or the bar, The Queen City Crepe is a savory standout, and the Bananas Foster and Nutella & Bananas (don't forget the strawberries!) dessert crepes are plain old joy in a bowl.

If crepes aren't your speed*, their burgers were a close second in The Charlotte Observer's 2011 \"New School Best Burger\" contest, and paired with the Pesto Brie Fries, the meal is a sure winner. Regardless of what is chosen, it will be as delicious as the eclectic people stew that is increasingly stirring in NoDa, where the Crepe Cellar can be found at 3116 North Davidson Street in Charlotte.

*Crazy talk."}
{"text":"I have to say, I was quite disappointed with the crepes.  We got the Queen City and Mascarpone and Berries. They were thick and more like burrito texture than actually crepes.  Don't think i will  be coming here again for crepes."}
{"text":"We are in town because of the hurricane and so happy we found this place. We got the Pesto fries and the Buratta appetizers which were both delicious. For our entrees my husband absolutely loved the steak & Guinness pie, my son had the best hamburger ever and I had the salmon with pea & saffron risotto. All amazing!!! I loved everything we got and the staff was also so nice and friendly. We will definitely eat here again!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! The food was wonderful and the service was great. I went with my office for lunch and they were more than accommodating for our large group. Around the table, some coworkers raved about the fries and crepes. I got a roasted romaine salad, which was on the lunch special menu, and it was fabulous. Will definitely be going there again."}
{"text":"Great location in NoDa, right in the main section of North Davidson, next to many other great shops. Exterior and interior is very good. Atmosphere is excellent. Some people may describe it as \"hipster\" serving only craft beers etc. Though I don't think its a bad thing. 

Staff were quite friendly and engaging. Though for a crepe restaurant, their selection of crepes were quite limited. I ordered the Queen City crepe which was burst of flavor, the purple slaw on the side was also very good. The section of cocktails looked excellent too. One of the better restaurants in CLT."}
{"text":"Very very very very loud during weekend nights. I can barely hear what ppl sitting across the table is talking about. French onion soup is THE BEST I ever have. Dessert crepes are better then entree crepes to me."}
{"text":"I was here at lunch. They had a lunch menu that it is kept hidden unless you specifically ask for it. Why? If they are not interested in selling $10 meals, why do it? Furthermore, asked for a sparkling water, they brought the expensive large bottle of San Palegrino, and I was alone.  I feel that they keep pushing for the most expensive stuff, which is  not cool. Food is ok ( honestly? Not worth much more than $10)."}
{"text":"The pesto Brie fires were good and so were the Brussels sprouts. But everything else was an absolute disaster. My soup came out ice cold and to top t off its not actually soup. When you order a French onion soup it caramelized onions with cheese on top. One of the most disgusting things I have ever had. Should have never been called a soup, it has zero broth. I love French onion soup and this was a fricken disgrace. I would be itself ashamed. The service was beyond slow. I am definitely what one called a foodie and this is a disgrace to food. Olive Garden serves better soup.  Not to mention I watched someone else get a soup and looked way better than mine but our waiter told us that's just how the soup is. The restaurant was almost empty and we were seated in a back corner as if to hide us. I have worked in the restaurant industry for many years and this place is an absolute disgrace. Needs major improvement. Not to mention that when you order a beer it is only a 6 oz. pour when you are paying for a 12 oz. pour. As a fermentation science major this is just pathetic. Next time I'll just bring my own bottles."}
{"text":"I have recently moved to Atlanta and I really miss this place, especially on a cold rainy day or just a place where I can have quality food in a good ambiance where I can talk. I have been there several times because I value the creations of the chefs and cooks at this place as a culinary enthusiast that I am and a lover of 'real' food. I was always willing to try the chef's specials-which are obviously not on the menu, but often written on a mirror on the back wall or your waiter/waitress will tell you what they are -and was never disappointed.  For example, a couple of things I tried from the specials were:  

Poblano Pepper Bisque
Carrot Ginger Bisque
Fig Crêpe with Vanilla Ice Cream
Sea bass with Risotto and Rosted vegetables
Salmon Crêpe with Spinach and Rosted tomato 

If it's your first time I would go for one of their popular items: 

Queen City Crêpe
Salads! - if you are in for something lighter, their salads are great too! 
Pesto fries, especially if you're sharing them
Mascarpone and Berries Crêpe - if you are in the mood for something fresh
Bananas Foster Crêpe - if you want something warm and sweet on a cold day
Brownie in a Blanket Crêpe - if you just don't care lol

They also have a good selection of wine and cheese in case you are in for something small and just want a good place for a nice date.

Another, place I can't wait to go back to.

 Do yourself a favor, be adventurous and try the daily specials!"}
{"text":"I went here with some friends after a play at Upstage.
At first I was really not feeling the menu but I was starving and after everyone had ordered theirs and (quickly, might I add) got their dishes I ordered the fish and chips. The waitress was very patient with me. hahah

The meal was ok, but I found the actual texture of the fish to be too wet..? If that makes any sense. The batter was mad tasty though. I remember substituting the slaw for mac and cheese and wishing I hadn't. But idk maybe mac and cheese just isn't for me in general. I also shared the banana and nutella crepe with a friend - it was my first time trying nutella actually - and it was amazing! I'd come back just for that honestly."}
{"text":"Crepe Cellar is, by far, one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. Their dinner is great, but the gem is their brunch. The prices are fair, the service is great, and the food is amazing. The only problem with the restaurant is the size, so prepare to wait for a table (on popular nights). It is worth it."}
{"text":"A Tale of Two Fish and Chips

Had an order of Fish and Chips on Thursday...some of the best I've had anywhere.  Thick tender melt in your mouth cod..perfectly prepared, I was in heaven.  Bragged about it to friends.  Couldn't stop thinking about it.  So today, Sunday,  I roll in about 3:00pm to lay down $15.00 for the best darn Fish in Chips in Charlotte.  Remembering how large and filling my previous dinner was, I skipped the wonderful Brussel sprouts appetizer.  Finally, I'm about to be rewarded for my long journey.....and what?  What's this?  Are you kidding me?  The fish is gray, barely cooked in spots.  Has the appearance of poorly frozen fish, before being uninspiringly battered and deep fried.  I eat it all after having driven from South Charlotte and just not in the mood to make a scene.   Absolutely nothing like my experience just a few days before.  Honestly, I've had better from Ms. Paul's. I mention my impression to the bartender who is sympathetic, comps my beer, but apparently the management or the chef doesn't think it's important enough to address with me.  Based on this experience, I won't be returning for their \"Award Winning\" Fish and Chips any time soon.  Just way to expensive an outing for this type of inconsistency and lack of customer awareness.  I just feel so ripped off..."}
{"text":"The chef keeps changing so one day it will be good and then you go back and  the same item sucks"}
{"text":"Yum! We've been to the Crepe Cellar a few times for dinner, but this was our first brunch visit. The service was excellent as always. 

Highlights of brunch:
- The French press coffee was delicious! I drank the full pot.
- If I ever see \"home fries\" I think thick cut potatoes that are never crispy and make a hard pass. That is why I was so amazed that their home fries were actually great! They have a seasoning mix of old bay and brown sugar that make them a crispy mix of savory and sweet.
- The french onion soup was on point."}
{"text":"I had dinner there a couple days ago and was not impressed. I returned my meal bc it was so tough (it took a solid 30 to 45 seconds to cut one bite of my steak.) The service was mediocre at best. We ordered the featured desert crepe and it was awful! The crepe was cold, and not bc it hadn't been delivered to me in a timely manner but because it was pre made and had been refrigerated.  The only good thing about the meal were there brussels sprouts; however, doesn't make me want to go back."}
{"text":"Yes finally a cute lil place tucked in NoDa. I loved it here. 

My friend took me here for an early bday dinner. I got a roasted chicken crepe and it was delish! 

I will return here because of the cozy atmosphere and the location can't be any better."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a number of times and always great food.
Pros - the fries are awesome!

The recommendations are the Queen's, and Ham/Cheese, crepes.

Have had the 4 cheese crepe, and Mac/cheese. Average and would not recommend."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Crepe Cellar for a couple of years, and I was hoping it was still as delicious as it used to be..  I was not let down!  The french onion soup was well-rounded, much more flavorful than I thought it would be.  I got the four cheese crepe.  The presentation could have used a little work (they use these spiral, metal wire containers for the fries which seemed un-necessary and actually made it difficult to get the fries out, and the crepe was set on the plate with no garnish, very pale-looking) but the flavors were wonderful!  Of course we had the nutella and banana crepe for desert which was rich and satisfying.  

This would have been five stars had our service been a little better.  Went for lunch with a living social coupon and the place was busy (which may explain some of the service issues) but we were directed to seat ourselves and grabbed a table right away.  The server (Colleen, I believe) was mostly competent but not very friendly or conversational.  I asked to taste two wines and she brought out the wrong one... luckily I liked the other selection so I didn't make a fuss.

Overall, delicious and we will be back to try some of their dinner entrees."}
{"text":"First you are greeted and made to feel very much at home when you arrive. Then you partake in the most flavorful and delicious food! Fresh ingredients make the food so amazing! The Brie and pesto fries and the brussel sprouts with arugula pesto are my favorites! The crepes are delicate and flavorful and just superb. We tried the ham and gruyere and spinach and mushroom crepes.  I can't wait to return and try some other delicious meals here!!"}
{"text":"I had been to Crepe Cellar for breakfast and can vouch for their coffee. 
Tonight we decided to check it out for dinner. I got the special seared tuna. It's very salty. It comes with yummy goodness sweet potato (most likely it's drown in honey) and a little green beans (oh what make a plate seem healthy with green glazed in butter). In conclusion the plate was a ok.
We also ordered banana strawberry crepe for dessert. It comes with nutella and powdered sugar ladies and gents! Oooohh I so would run four miles just to get them again. Yea... I probably need about 20 miles run to burn the calories but if you can afford it... GET IT! :)
Just remember when you're there... the place is LOUD! Yea if you're trying to know your date, trust me the table next to you would know your date also by the end of the night."}
{"text":"It was a cool sunday morning. The streets were empty except for the cars and pedestrians. I met up with my family to dine at this fine establishment. We got there just as they opened the door. The waitresses were beautiful, the chefs looked badass, and the barkeep looked like the dude from Afro Samurai, with his afro, sans samurai sword. I thought they would have a huge selection of Crepes to choose from, but I was wrong. The menu was concise with few choices. This helps the indecisive customer. I ordered the Ham and Gruyere Crepe, it was the square one. I took a picture of it. It was absolutely delicious. The crepe itself was just perfect, it wasn't too soggy, there wasn't too much cheese. The maple mustard sauce they drizzled on top made my taste buds explode in delectable ecstasy. I would rate this dish 5 stars. My brother ordered the queen city crepe. It was not as good. I would rate that one 3 stars. The shrimp with grits my mom ordered was very flavorful, but the portion size was ridiculously small. How much do grits cost? Probably less than rice, and rice don't cost that much. The pricing is a bit expensive as well. But due to the beautiful waitresses and the afro samurai, along with the extremely delicious crepes, this place gets a 4 star! Would definitely come back next time they do another Groupon deal."}
{"text":"Love, love this place! Have eaten here several times and have never been disappointed. First and most importantly, coffee is served in an individualized French press, perfectly brewed. Delicious. Service is impeccable. I've had both dinner and dessert crepes. All are wonderful. Also have had salads and a wonderful southern okra soup that is absolutely exceptional. This is a \"must visit\" for anytime in Charlotte. Located in the NODA area, this restaurant is one of many go-to establishments for the adventurous."}
{"text":"Moved down here a little over a year ago. I've dined at many places around town and they served me the best meal I've had out to date. The downside? It was a special. Seared tuna over a poblano cheese grit cake with citrus pepper butter - I could eat this every meal for weeks and not tire of it. Hoping our very attentive server conveyed my message to the chef and they add it to the menu, cuz, ya know, I have that kind of pull in these here parts! Excellent beer selections. Diverse menu. I will be back. Tuna-in for my next review. See what I did there?"}
{"text":"Good, not great.  I could explain all the things that make this place merely so-so, but who really cares?  A lot of people will see this 3-star review and act like it's a 1-star review.  The place is fine.  I'll just never go back.  Typical Charlotte.  A bajillion 5-star reviews, leaving me scratching my head.  Again, place is ok, but people are acting like it's something special. It's not.  The humblest street crepe in Paris is 10x better and a third the cost."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner and I have mixed thoughts about the place. The pesto fries, salad, and soup we had were great but the ham and gruyere crepe I had was so over powered by the sauce I couldn't taste anything else. There was service followed the same pattern, everyone was very sweet with the exception of one waitress. Overall I'd go back again but I wouldn't order that crepe again."}
{"text":"The Crepe Cellar feels plucked off a street in Paris. It's a fabulous neighborhood bistro with great, well-priced food. The atmosphere strikes that right balance between quality and casual. It's always busy, the staff are always friendly and everything is really, really tasty."}
{"text":"It took me a while to try this place, but I am really glad that I did.  I have to admit that I was expecting the crepes to be more on the dessert side (which they have), but they have quite a few savory crepe options as well.  I tried the Ham and Gruyere crepes and really enjoyed them.  The shoestring fries (or Frites) were really good as well.  Really salty and crispy.  All in all, I would definitely like to go back to this establishment so that I can try some other menu items."}
{"text":"We went to Crepe Cellar for brunch/lunch. Arrived a little before opening time and was seated quickly when the doors opened. We sat at the bar. Ordered waters and the burger and the Queen City crepe. Both were delicious. The burger was cooked perfectly.  We would definitely recommend this restaurant for it's food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very quick service and friendly staff.  The spinach and wild mushroom crepe was very tasty.  The selection of beers and wines was pretty good.  Had banana foster crepe for desert perfect ending to the meal.  Would eat hear again unfortunately only passing through Charlotte so won't be in the area anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great spot on Davidson that specializes in crepes.  The savory entree crepes were pretty good, but I have to agree with most everyone else that the desert crepes are a huge draw.  They do not hold back on their use of nutella.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the place.  It kind of felt like a cellar: very dim, exposed brick, comfortable, slightly cold.  I also liked how casual it felt.  Nice place to enjoy dinner with friends.  The service was good and they have a full bar and nice little wine selection.

For my entree I got a tasty ham and cheese crepe.  it was drizzled with some kind of sauce and had a slight horseradish kick to it.  Nothing out of this world, but filling and fun!  The other crepes sounded delicious and they had a nice special crepe that contained fish."}
{"text":"A truly great change from your standard fare.  The craft cocktails are always delicious and the staff friendly.  More importantly, the crepe dishes are amazing and creative.  For a crepe joint, the fish and chips are off the chain!  Expansion looks great too."}
{"text":"I like this place.  Small intimate dining room with large windows looking out on the busy street (they can be opened in nice weather!).  Nutella crepe dessert espcially delicious.  My hubby had an issue with his pork which they corrected quickly.  Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"The burrata was divine. The crepes were amazing. The brownie dessert was decadent. Amazing experience, a must-try."}
{"text":"Not so nice hostess.  Grumpy and handed out dirty looks as if it was her job to do so.  Kinda takes the wind out of an anticipated nice time.  Each time she passed by we received a \"look\".  Lol.

Waitress made up for it.  She was nice, friendly, and loved her job.  She made you feel like coming back, as did all others we encounteted.

Unique menu with items in all categories and all price levels.

Food was good.  Burger was great but the veggie burger was cold, they swapped it out quickly, and gave me a free glass of wine to hold me over until it arrived. 

Would definitely give them another try.   Maybe Grumpy will have the day off."}
{"text":"I thought it was just ok. The wait was over an hour, so I thought this is going to be good. Sat down it was so hot in the place. A/c must have been busted, but no biggie shit happens. I ordered the cheese crepe which was way to cheesy and a bit bland.  My husband ordered some kind of chicken crepe which he thought was just ok. Pesto fries were just ok. Everything was just ok.  Now question is would we go back. I would say if we were with friends and they wanted to go I guess so. If we were alone cabo fish taco is across the street and is a fabulous restaurant ."}
{"text":"I've been to the Crepe Cellar twice.  My first experience was great.  The second, not so much.

First time, I ordered the oyster po' boy.  Absolutely fantastic!  A generous serving of plump, juicy, tasty oysters, cooked perfectly, along with a great little sauce on a hearty roll.  Very very good.

So . . . I went back again.  But since I just have to try everything at a good restaurant, this time I ordered crepes.  How could I go wrong, right?  Worst crepes I've ever had.  And (at the risk of sounding like a giant snob) I've had them in France--and made them myself--so I know a little something about crepes.  These were very thick--much more akin to a pancake.  A good crepe is so thin you can see through it.  And the flavor was--well, it just wasn't there.  The filling was yummy--spinach and mushrooms and cheese (forget what kind, but there was a little too much of it).  After awhile, I gave up on the crepes and just ate the filling.

Service was great, atmosphere is really nice, but when I go back--and I will--I'll order something other than crepes."}
{"text":"This place is way overhyped. Came here for the first time on a rainy Friday and waited for our table at the bar. It took 2 bartenders over 15 minutes to even come get our order....and they weren't even that many people ordering drinks!! 

After 30 minutes waiting, we finally got to our table. Granted, this place is tiny and everyone is sitting quite close to each other. The only nice person working here was the man who came out with our dishes.

We ordered the gnocchi and the spinach crepe. The gnocchi was blah--it tasted like soft raw dough balls and the crepe itself was good, but the filling with the goat cheese was kind of bland. We would have ordered dessert, but the way it was understaffed, we figured it would have taken another 30 minutes just for the waitress to come back and see how we were doing, so we just left.

Would not come back here again unless it was a random Tues, Wed early afternoon and I was starving."}
{"text":"Love the new menu here! The beef tartare and pasta carbonara were top notch. Glad they kept some of our favorite menu items while expanding options. Make sure to check it out soon."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and presentation of the food here. Great location in the North Davidson St. (NODA) area. Good selection of beer and wine. I enjoyed sitting at the bar with friends. Had the P.E.I. Mussels with crusty french bread. This evening it was a lemon and rosemary broth. The rosemary was a little overpowering but still tasty. The mussels could have been a bit fresher but still enjoyed the meal. Feels like a Chef driven restaurant with the type of menu selection and changing daily specials. I look forward to going back and trying something new."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice dinner on a Thursday night around 6:30pm. We started with the mussels (huge portion and delicious!) and the pesto Brie fries (amazing). We shared the special Crepe which had beef brisket. It was also very tasty. Drinks were good as well, a bit on the pricey side though. 
My one complaint was the seating. We were over in the back at a two top table and across from us was a half moon style table with six people. Because of the small space, we heard their entire conversation and it was very loud! Our quiet and romantic dinner became not so very fast. However, we've been here before and really love the food and overall vide. Will be back."}
{"text":"Oh Crepe Cellar, when I heard about you, I thought it would be love at first bite. Well, here we are at three stars.... 

I feel like I'm one of the last people in Charlotte to check out this place and even though it wasn't everything I hoped for, I'm happy I got to try it. I was surprised by how tiny it was with only nine tables in the entire restaurant with a small bar area. Be sure to get there at the right time or be prepared to wait since they don't take reservations. 

Ok, so everything on the menu looked good. They had po boys, french baguette pizzas, pastas and more but I couldn't go to the Crepe Cellar without order some yummy, warm crepes so I got the Queen City crepes-roasted chicken, bacon, cheddar topped with oven roasted tomato dressing. 

The crepes were good but nothing out of this world. Perhaps I had my heart set on some crepes that would make me want to reenact the deli scene from \"When Harry Met Sally\" but sadly this wasn't the case. They tasted like a hot wrap I could've ordered at an Applebee's or elsewhere and was missing the magic touch. Don't get me wrong, they were good and if it weren't 8pm, I wouldn't had scarfed them down so veraciously as I had. since they were just average tasting. Also, they didn't have that much of a selection of crepes-I think about five or six for the entrees and the same number for dessert crepes. 

Service was rockin though along with the bartender-both very helpful and quick to suggest an item so that made up for the meh experience of the crepes. I would expect a place with the name Crepe Cellar to have more of a variety of crepes but I guess that's not what they are going for."}
{"text":"Delicious and gorgeous entrees and yummy crepes.

The Guinness souffle is delicious and gorgeous.  All of the entrees coming from the kitchen looked delicious.  French press coffee is amazing as well.

Tried the Grand Mariner crepe, and berries and creme.  Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times specifically for the brownie in a blanket crepe, it's my favorite dessert in town!
Recently I came in twice for dinner with friends, The pesto brie fries are very good. They are worth getting.
The only thing that was disappointing was my cellar burger, I was excited to try it, and I love burgers, but it was SO dry. I had to drench it in ketchup and it wasn't even well done. Very unimpressed by my burger but so far that's the only thing I've had that I won't order again."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are so good one of my favorite dinning places atmosphere very romantic this is one of my favorite date night spots"}
{"text":"I was definitely apprehensive about going here for lunch.  After all, crepes are for breakfast or dessert.  However, after reading some of the reviews I had to try it, well because I like food that is different.

The decor/atmosphere was pretty casual.  The service was a bit slow despite the fact that there weren't that many people there.  However, the food was excellent!  I have been there a couple times now and had the Queen City crepe and the special with sausage/red pepper.  It was all very good. 

I also made a mistake of ordering a dessert wrap with the mistaken belief I would be able to eat that with lunch.  Well, I did eat it, it was excellent, and I suffered for the rest of the day.

Overall, the only reason I knocked it down a star is because the service has been slow every time I have gone.  Otherwise, if you are looking for great food in NoDa, I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Good food, HORRIBLE service...

I've visited Crepe Cellar quite a few times, and my last 2 experiences have pretty much shown me that they don't appreciate your business and couldn't care less about the service they give customers. Most recently, I went there on a Sunday, early afternoon, for brunch. We were seated quickly, but after waiting 10 min, and seeing several servers ignore us, and not even come take our drink orders, I had had enough. I watched a server speak to a table of guys right behind me, who were already done with their meal, and she didn't even look in my direction. Sadly enough, this server was the same person who seated me! Ridiculous. I brought it to their attention as I walked out the door, and the response I got was nonchalant & very unapologetic. Nevertheless, it was my last time there."}
{"text":"What a lovely spot! A group of about 8 of us went to Crepe Cellar last night for dinner. The place is a little small, but that is one of my favorite things about this place. Since it's on the small side we had to wait for a 6 and a 4 top to be ready to accommodate us so we went to Growlers next door (both owned by the same people)  and grabbed some drinks while we waited for a our tables to be ready. 

I had yellow fin tuna special and my sister had the mussels, and my goodness both where out of this world! The yellow fin crepe was amazing, deliciously spicy but perfectly cooked and balanced. The mussels melted in my mouth and the garlic was not over powering but perfect, oh god I'm thinking about the sauce and bread and I need to go back right now. This place is perfect for date night or just meeting up with a friend, or just go and eat yourself into a nap."}
{"text":"I love the Noda area and was glad I got to visit the area and try someplace new last night. 
I went with my girlfriend and dad yesterday and it was a wonderful experience. I will speak fondly of this place towards all those who can hear the sound of my voice and to those who read my words. Heed them. Heed these words or warning. EAT HERE!!! or you will die without fully experiencing this world to it's fullest. Your soul will forever be trapped in purgatory until you are able to figure out where you went wrong, re-enter a new body, and try again in this world.
Even for those of you whom I don't speak to aloud, I will try my damndest to psychically emit thoughts to their brain about how delicious this place is from a subconscious level, even while asleep. 
I tried the blackbean and carrot burger and it was... delicious. I received pink coleslaw with it and although I had to look around to make sure I wasn't having (yet another) random psychedelic response for no reason, I found that, to my delight, the coleslaw really is pink. And delicious. It didn't have that overwhelming mayo or sweet onion taste to it. It tasted...uh... delicious.
The beer, I think it was Bell's Amber or something like that, was also delicious and because they were having tap problems and delayed getting me a glass, they gave it to me for free. My dad had a steak and my girlfriend had a crepe and it was DELICIOUS according to them. My love love also had a beer, Dogfish Nameste and she's a fan of it. 
Also, I like the environment. The lighting in combination with the wallpaper and glasswear, to me, gave it a comfortable, relaxing, and even romantic atmosphere. The staff was also very nice. The waitress even genuinely laughed at my dad's corny jokes. I hope she didn't kill herself afterwards. I'm sure she's fine though."}
{"text":"This past Saturday evening was our first (but certainly not last!) experience at the Crepe Cellar in NoDa.   We expected it to be busy (as we've seen people lined up on the street before), but the waittime wasn't bad.  The hostess took our name and phone number down on an iPad so they could text us when our table was ready.  I loved that!  So much better than the old restaurant pager.  This allowed us to go \"out of range\" and walk around NoDa while we waited.  

We got back just in time for a text letting us know that our table was ready.  Perfect timing!  We were seated in a huge booth by the window.  I felt a little guilty because we were taking up so much space but I really loved being seated there with a view instead of at one of the tables that are closer together.

I expected the menu to be full of crepes, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the menu was pretty extensive and offered a variety of appetizers, sandwiches, salads, and entrees besides crepes.  I had a tough time deciding what to get because three or four things were jumping out at me.  

We did start with the Pesto Brie Fries, though, as an appetizer.  Not only was the topping delicious and unique, but the fries themselves were, too.  They could have used a lot more Brie, though, for my tastes. 

I ordered the Chicken Cordon Blue sandwich and my partner ordered the Black and Blue Po Boy (blackened chicken and blue cheese).  It wasn't really a true \"po boy\" sandwich, though, but no worries.  Both sandwiches were good, but after taking a bite of each other's, I suddenly fell in love with the Black and Blue and he really liked the Cordon Blue better because it was less spicy.  So...we swapped and both had a delicious meal.  Because we already had the french fries app, he opted for the alternative purple coleslaw as a side, and I substituted for a good-sized side salad for only $1 more.  

We were pretty full after all of that, but we felt that we had to order a crepe for dessert, having skipped over the dinner crepes.   Obviously they must be good; they named the restaurant after them!  We went with the Bananas Foster Crepe.  Good choice.  The sauce that came over top the crepe was divine.   

Our server was fantastic.  She was so super friendly and very attentive, despite the very busy (but small) dining room.  

I look forward to returning.  The prices were reasonable and there were definitely some other entrees I'd like to try.  I'll just make sure to wear pants with an elastic waist."}
{"text":"If I were able to leave NO stars I would. They have HORRIBLE customer service. The restaurant had literally just opened this morning. There were at least 3 servers and everyone else who came in at the same time as we did were served with at least water and were being attending to. After about 5-7 minutes I decided that was it, we got up and left no one said anything. They just let us walk out. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Solid crêpes. Definitely cannot complain about that. The decor was clean and well-finished. I've seen some comments that this is un-NoDa-ish, which is true, but they sell crêpes: they need to bring a little class to suit the food. Their decor matches their menu and clashes with their neighbors. What is more NoDa than clashing with the neighbors?

My ham and Gruyère crêpe was great, except for the healthy dose of mustard that wasn't described on the menu. I scraped it off, and things were smooth from there.

But my main course was overshadowed by the dessert. The bananas foster crêpe was freaking unbelievable. I have never seen so much caramel in one place. So good. But so filling. Next time, I'll skip straight to dessert."}
{"text":"Checked out Crepe Cellar for lunch. Walked by many times at night during gallery crawls and it is always packed so I needed to see what all the fuss was about. OFFICIAL PBR JOINT. 

Had to try the crepes of course and ordered a chicken crepe, which came with Fries for $9. Good price and recommended by the server. Good & Bad...Good = flavor of the sauce; Bad = bites without sauce had little to no flavor (bland). And let's be honest, I wouldn't want to eat something bathed in sauce. 

That said; I didn't get a chance to try the dessert crepes, which I can only assume are the real treat of Crepe Cellar, so I'll be back for round two sometime soon. If for no other reason to have a PBR out of the can ;)"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great food.  A little small but that's the way things are on north Davidson so can't complain!"}
{"text":"Great place in Noda! So glad we found this place it was so yummy. Great drink selection, menu full of variety we got the cheese appetizer, fish and chips (heads up they said it can be shared but it's only one piece of fish but still so good) and a Nutella filled crepe. It Is a bit pricey but totally understandable with its quality and the server was excellent."}
{"text":"I have been going here since it opened.  I always say get the fish special, the french club, the arugula salad or any of the entrees.  I have never been a fan of the crepes with the exception of the dessert crepe (wow, banana, ice cream and nutella).  

Colleen or Catherine are my favorites.  Colleen is one of the most talented mixologists on the planet and Catherine does service to perfection.  This is a local place where a lot of neighbors have been going for years.  It is all about quality and consistency.  I have only left unhappy once after way too many visits (and manhattans).

The fish and chips used to be the best in Charlotte but they changed the fish a while ago and it has never been the same.  That is my one complaint. :)"}
{"text":"The pesto Brie fries were amazing... they were not too overloaded with pesto or brie and they were very well cooked. Fry's himself or crunchy and delicious. A small order is plenty for two people to share. The restaurant itself was not very busy in the staff was very nice. It did not take long for food to come out nor the check."}
{"text":"We had the 1/2 baguette pizza and the 3 mini crepes w/side Mac n Cheese and it was amazing! Server was very kind. Absolutely worth the drive! Beautiful inside too. We will be back."}
{"text":"\"Woohoo, as good as it gets!\" is on the money for me when it comes to Crepe Cellar. I love this place and I seriously daydream about it often and get excited whenever its in the mix as a dinner option. To start, its got a great personality - its dimly lit, the decor is intimate and personable as the place itself is more on the smaller side. Because it is on the smaller side, sometimes there is a wait. However, it is nice that they take your number to text you so you can pop on over to a nearby bar to grab a drink and be alerted when you're about to be in for a treat!

Okay, let me state the obvious - Pesto Brie Fries. Do not ever not order these. They should always be ordered, no matter how many times you have had them. I love fries, I love cheese, and I love pesto and the mix of all three, my goodness, phenomenal. They have never had an 'off day' or come out soggy or lacking in toppings, they are just always fantastic and worth eating your weight in fries. 

The rest of the menu is just as fantastic. We have tried quite a few things off the menu and I have thoroughly enjoyed them all. Its one of those places where I could order my favorite thing over and over but I legitimately want to try everything. Their dinner crepes are well sized and stuffed and are very good, as are their pizzas.

They have changing specials and these are aaaalways SO delicious. I have tried their swordfish and a PBR bacon mussels option and I enjoyed them so much, I went home to try and find/pathetically recreate the recipes. (I have yet to succeed in this endeavor). I am anxiously looking forward to the short rib option, as last time they were out - so I will clearly need to return soon for this. As for dessert, somehow, I have yet to have a dessert crepe here - I dont know how as I love crepes and I love dessert, so something is wrong here and I'll fix this soon. 

Point is, this place is truly 'as good as it gets.' Their waitstaff is attentive, polite, timely, and truly interested in their customers and that is a huge plus. The food is so delicious and I want to try everything and so should you. Now, go. Don't forget to order the fries. ::drools a little::"}
{"text":"After reading so many positive reviews I finally made my way to NODA to check out this place. We were seated in a comfortable over-sized booth against the front windows so we were able to people watch while eating.   The interior is pleasing and appeared very clean. 

NODA foot traffic has really picked up during the daytime but the area really comes to life after dark. But back to the food. 

The first thing that surprised me on this menu was the wide variety of food in general. If you aren't a crepe person, they have burgers, subs, pizza and an array of sides including fresh-cut fries and brussel sprouts, yummmmm! I ordered the Queen City Crepe and paid $1 extra for a side of fries. I am a french fry junkie and when they are fresh-cut, the more likely I am to eat there. All their crepes use Buckwheat and at first I was a little hesitant since I was not familiar with the taste. But WOW!! This makes the 5th crepe restaurant I have tried over the past year and Crepe Cellar wins hands down (not saying the others were bad). The overall taste of this crepe, which included bacon, chicken and cheese (and a few other things I can't remember) was absolutely delicious. Kudos to the chef !! Oh, and those fresh-cut fries will have me back in no time. 

With the food being this good, it was hard not to pass on dessert. We decided to split the Strawberry Creme Cheesecake. It was so good, I bought one to go. I cannot wait for my next visit. As much as I liked the crepe, I am tempted to try a burger or the chicken cordon bleu. I can only imagine how good these would be seeing how good the crepes were."}
{"text":"I brought my friends here while in town. We all left full and happy. The decor is appealing. I had the \"queen city\", can never go wrong with chicken and bacon. Our waiter was attentive and nice. No disappointments :)"}
{"text":"The food here is really good!! 

Though i haven't tried the actual crepes lol my friends always go and try many different dishes such as: their burger, all the dessert crepes, pesto brie fries, all the baguette pizzas, fish/chips...etc, no one has been disappointed yet.

:) must try place in NODA"}
{"text":"First of all this needs to be a 4.5.  Had the fish and chips and they were outstanding!!  The crepes Suzette for desert may be the best desert I have ever had.  The only reason this place is a 4.5 is the service is a little slow.  The staff is very nice. Love this place and have to go to it when I'm in Charlotte.   Love it!!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. Amazing food and friendly service. Lots to choose from for both food, beer and wine.  I will come nack over and over."}
{"text":"Visited around 12:30 pm on a Saturday and it was not crowded at all, despite how small the restaurant is. Our waitress took a whole and a couple of jokes to warm up to us and was a little bit slow on refilling the drinks, but overall service was not bad.

I had n awesome chicken Crepe with a side of Mac and cheese. The creamiest Mac and cheese ever, it was delish!!

I'd go back for sure and next time try dessert. 

Only one drawback and that was parking, but not anything that would stop me from returning."}
{"text":"I went when they first opened and did not like it. i had a crepe with spinach and goat cheese it was super bland and not good. we also had the mussels and they were just ok. I will say that there sandwiches looked great and if I find myself over there I will try it again"}
{"text":"Food just ok for me. I had a savory crepe with ham & cheese. Wasn't great. I'd like to go back & try a dessert crepe next time. Dim lighting, cool, calm & classy interior. great place for a date."}
{"text":"It has taken time, but Crepe Cellar is maturing. At first the crepe list was overwhelming but now they have a modified menu and serve lots of great local ingredients. When not crowded, this is an enjoyable spot for good conversation and a glass of wine. The staff is very nice and the restaurant is a great addition to NoDa."}
{"text":"Size/ambiance wise, this is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Weird huh? It just reminds me of my favorite casual neighborhood restaurants/pubs in London, Chicago and San Francisco. 

The first time I went with a girlfriend it was a busy stormy night and we sat at the bar for dinner because we couldn't wait for a table. I ordered fish and chips because I had heard they were voted the best in Charlotte, which is kind of like being voted tallest of the Pygmies. Sorry blokes, the fish 'n chips in the Queen City would not make the Queen happy! So I was hopeful, but they disappointed. Unlike Mike K's experience, my fish wasn't soggy or spot on, mine was over fried and quite hard (3/5). I felt it was a bit over battered and then just left in too long. The chips were great tasting but some were quite greasy and soggy. I would love to go back and have both spot on. But I also had the marscapone & berries crepe which was a revelation (5/5). As great as the bananas foster crepe was, I still actually prefer the marscapone/berry crepe!

The second time I went I ordered the spinach & wild mushroom +chicken savory crepe and we shared a bananas foster crepe (4/5). The savory crepe was 3.5/5 good but not the best I've ever had (and they pale in comparison to Cafe Monte's savory crepes).  My husband struggled to find an entree (he doesn't like savory crepes) but was healthy, so he went with a pork special, but be forewarned: DON'T GO IF YOU\"RE ON A DIET! Service on food was great and patient (silly hub was in a picky mood) and bar service is slower.

The last time we went, I got the steak and frites and hubby got the french onion soup and the Crepe Cellar burger complete with onion straws, gruyere and some nice seasoning. Best of all? You can order the burger the temperature you want (in theory) because they grind their own meat in house. I would give the burger 4.5/5 because it came out over done for how he ordered it, but the taste was great without being greasy. He really liked the bun too. French Onion soup was on the sweet side, not too much cheese and was very nice (5/5). My steak was prepared to the right temperature and was a good cut of meat but there was a lot of char on the outside which I had to cut away or accidentally eat and the red wine reduction lacked enough oomph to cover it up. (3/5) Maybe adding a dash of balsamic would have done the trick. Regardless, the frites were more evenly fried and the meal was lovely. Next time I will try mussels or fish special and H will try the baguette pizza.

Bottom Line: Go for the sweet crepes. If they got more variety in the entrees in the \"healthy\" arena, we would be regulars."}
{"text":"Overall - just alright.

Pros: excellent service, and the brie and pesto fries appetizer was a new look at cheese fries that was a welcome addition to my life.

I went to Crepe Cellar with some friends this weekend. We shared a handful of entre crepes to see what we would like and they were, for the most part, a little lacking in flavor.

The look and feel of the place was very fititng with the NoDa scene and an overall good addition to the food options in North Davidson."}
{"text":"I am really surprised by some of the lower ratings I received about the Crepe Cellar. I think the restaurant is wonderful. They tend to always have great new dinner specials and the everyday menu has an array of different options that are all great. Yes, the location is extremely small and it is usually packed tightly on weekend nights but the location also gives the place its character."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place.

Get their fries with pesto on them, and you will be quite happy....

So, so good.

Cool atmosphere, as well.  Low-key high-brow."}
{"text":"First let me start off by saying this place is absolutely amazing! My girlfriend & I, we love this place. It's our usual Sunday breakfast spot when we're both not too busy. The place is a little on the smaller side but the decor inside makes everything feel so homey. 

My favorite thing on the menu are the grits, it's sooooo good and I mean mouthwatering good. It's creamy and literally just melts in your mouth. Best grits I've ever had! But don't get me wrong, everything else on the menu is just as great. Also, their French pressed coffee is so YUM! Fresh and taste wonderful.

Now about the service. Usually when we go they do get pretty busy so we do have to wait a little while, which we don't mind because everyone here is always so kind. Even if you plan to go right when they open you'll see that there's already people waiting outside. Our server is always very attentive unless it gets really busy which is understandable. It's definitely a nice environment to be in!"}
{"text":"Celebrated friend's birthday with 4 girls on a Thursday night. The place was not too crowded and it was easy to get a table for 5. Pesto Brie Fries is a must!!! They were as good as what they claimed to be - the best of the best. We were so glad that we went with the large one! I had salmon crepe for entree. It was ok but a bit salty. We also shared a brownie in the basket for dessert. It was literally a chunk of brownie wrapped in a crepe topped with Nutella, candied walnuts, whipped cream and a huuuge scope of vanilla ice cream. I had no idea why it was a single serving because the five of us shared one and had plenty left. Overall, it was a great experience. And I've heard good things about their brunch too - definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Good stuff.... great addition to NoDa. Good food but fantastic atmosphere. No where to wait ... and you can't have a drink on the sidewalk, but after your name hits top of the list, you will enjoy sitting down in a community of other relaxed friends and having good wine and grub."}
{"text":"The food was out of this world,! The ambiance was really nice. The waitress was not friendly and made us feel like she was in a hurry. Very loud inside to talk.
Will definitely come back because the food was that good, just hope we get a better waitress!"}
{"text":"A delicious evening in Noda.  The service was great, and the atmosphere casual.  A truly enjoyable evening. I wish the host that sat us would have pointed out the wine on the board on special. Other than that no complaints. Every bit of the Valentines tuna special was excellent."}
{"text":"Love this place! Now, to start, I am NOT a Crepe aficionado but that does not stop me from loving good food. I went here last night for the first time with a friend. We started off with some wine,which they have a good but small selection as they do the beer list. When we sat down we tried the Cellar Plate which contained 2 different gourmet meats and cheeses with crusty bread. It was OK but a little skimpy for me. On to dinner, I really wanted to try the fish and chips but hesitated due to the bad reviews it's received on Yelp so instead I  opted for  the Sausage and Peppers Crepe and my friend ordered the Spinach/Mushroom Crepe. I was blown away with the amount of food that they served. My Crepe covered the entire plate and my friends' consisted of 2 large Crepes traditionally rolled. I will say that the sides that we ordered were not needed due to the generous portion of our entree. The Sausage was cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of flavor. I was not expecting that as most places I find just don't have good sausage. My friend loved her meal as well. 

The seating was very limited and very close together which gave it a cozy feel but you can definitely hear everyone elses coversation. I like smaller restaurants like this because they are more representative of the locals. The staff was very friendly too. Great place for a first date or just a romantic date with your favorite person. Needless to say, I will be returning here in the near future. Only this time I will try those Pesto Brie fries that everyone is talking about!"}
{"text":"I was close to NoDa at lunch time today, so I decided to pop into the Crepe Cellar to grab a quick bite.  I settled in at the bar to check out the lunch options and was pleasantly surprised to learn about the lunch special  - $8 for selected entrées  plus $1 more for my choice of side items. 

I chose the Queen City Crepe.  It is made with roasted chicken, cheddar, tomatoes, and oven roasted tomato sauce in a buckwheat crepe. (It also normally comes with bacon, but I had them leave it off of mine.)

It was a toss up between the hand-cut fries or the mac-n-cheese, but the mac-n-cheese won out. I was not disappointed because it was creamy and full of flavor.  As it turns out, they make it to order with Béchamel sauce and 4 cheeses. Yummo!

The place is cute and service was very friendly. Since I was there for lunch and had to go back to work, I didn't partake of any of the adult beverages, but they looked to have a good selection - especially wines & beers.

I would definitely recommend checking it out if you are looking for a tasty place to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Crepe Cellar- Take Two.  We went out last night on a Tuesday 948p night wanting to find a restaurant that served food till 11p, Crepe Cellar was open and our server was pleasant.  We had brussel sprouts, pasta with roasted red peppers & goat cheese and a spinach mushroom crepe.  Everything was delish.  Good to know for a school night.  Have I mentioned how spectacular the brussel sprouts are?  OMG."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why they have crepe in their name. The crepe dishes are only a fraction of the menu, and I didn't think they were that great.

The brussel sprouts however, very good!"}
{"text":"Went to Crepe on a hot night.    Their air conditioning was inadequate.  I mentioned it to the waitress but she blew it off (so to speak :-)    We were all uncomfortable (and we're too young for hot flashes :-D)     My friends seemed happy with their food but I ordered fish and chips, which was described in the menu as having won an award.  Well, the fish was overcooked and dry & the breading was almost burnt.   I wonder if the cooks were also suffering from the heat and not able to do their best."}
{"text":"Food and service are always on point! Love the mussels and the arugula salad! Everything is to die for! And the staff is always very pleasant. I always sit at the bar and have a wonderful experience! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I went back for dinner, and this time I was not disappointed my spinach salad wash delicious.  The service was great and don't forget to try the sangria as well as a dessert crepe :)"}
{"text":"Pretty much the bread and butter date night or sweet tooth du jour of NoDa. You really can't go wrong at Crepe Cellar. 

The crepes are made with buckwheat, so you may be in for a bit of a surprise at first bite. A a little more chewy, earthy, and malty than your mom's crepes. Definitely better for the savory variety. 

One of the strengths of Crepe Cellar is their offering of savory and sweet crepes. You definitely need to try the Queen City savory. Wonderful flavors. Can't believe how much it made me love chicken, mushrooms and spinach together. Who knew all it took was a buckwheat crepe? The oven-roasted tomato dressing goes good on ANYTHING. Definitely the center stage act of this dish. 

When it comes to sweet, just try anything. You won't be unhappy. Especially with a piping hot brownie, ice cream and accompanying a warm, fresh crepe. Come on, America. France is right on this one. 

Lastly, alcohol. I love that they have so many good beers. Both both bottle and draught. Lots to choose from. Or, if you're a redneck like me, PBR is pretty cheap here. Hell yes. If you're of the classier alcohol mantra, definitely go for the Cellar Cider. Wonderful little concoction. Baron Jager and a few other spirits. Definitely worth the dough. 

Limited seating here, folks. Make sure you get here at a decent hour or put your name in and walk the streets of NoDa. Typically an hour wait or so on busy nights. 

You'll be pleased with your visit. Bar none. One of the staples in the Queen City."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM! 
Went there for dessert after stuffing our faces across the street at Cabo Fish Taco.  
We got a table right away with a lovely waitress.  Since it is so small I imagine that the only reason we were able to sit right away was due to the snowy weather.  But that was great for us!
My co-diners and I decided to share two dessert crepes - Nutella and Bananas and Brownie in a Blanket.  Both were delicious however the brownie crepe was the winner simply because it included nutella, ice cream and whipped cream.  
I would recommend the Crepe Cellar for a dessert destination!"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about the Crepe Cellar, so when a friend suggested it as a the location for group Sunday brunch my interests were piqued. Having passed by en route to other NoDa locations, I knew that seating was not particularly plentiful, but I was pleased when my roommate and I arrived first in our group (at 1:15) and were able to score a booth for six.  We ordered a french press of coffee to split (with the acknowledgment that we could always order another later) while we waited for the rest of our party. It was fresh, tasty and the timer they gave us to determine when the coffee was to our particular strength liking was both helpful and adorable, but there was no doubt we would be ordering seconds. I hate to admit it, but as a coffee fiend I would have sacrificed some on quality to add some quantity.

One of our friends used to work at Crepe Cellar, and she ordered a plate of pesto brie fries for the table. I owe here thanks for this because they were delightful, particularly when paired with their tomato ranch which she asked for on the side. I had had a hankering for shrimp and grits all week, so I was pleased to see that they were on the specials board. The grits were creamy but not pasty, the shrimp were plentiful and the gravy was perfectly seasoned and tasted of white wine and hugs. One of our friends ordered the mussels special, which came with a lemongrass & sweet chili sauce and between she and her boyfriend, not a mussel escaped uneaten. Our ex-employee companion got the eggs benedict. The roomie opted for the Sausage & Egg Breakfast Crepe. The flavor from the sausage and red peppers really shone through and the homefries which accompanied were nice and crisp. Where the coffee lacked quantity, the food certainly didn't (particularly the crepes) and I was forced to abandon my last shrimp to the dish pan.

It is hard to comment on the service since the waitress was friends with someone at our table so we were obviously well attended, but I did not get the impression that we would have been left wanting otherwise. The atmosphere was bright and perfectly suited for a Sunday brunch. Prices ran in the 8-13 dollar range for our main dishes, though be warned coffee will run you about 5 bucks.

Overall, Crepe Cellar hit the spot and was a nice change of pace from our normal Sunday pancake routine."}
{"text":"Trendy, pub with cool UK beer, food selections. Came in for a night cap and got absolutely stuffed by the fudge brownie in a crepe.....it is one dense mutha! Good luck with that biatch!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to go into a long diatribe, just going to say that the food is delicious.  

Pesto-brie french fries.  DO IT!  I was skeptical (for some reason I never remember that I like pesto) but they were so delicious.  

I had the blackened chicken po-boy.  SO MUCH FLAVOR.  the spiciness of the blackened chicken and the ancho chile aioli was somewhat undercut by the creaminess of the blue cheese.  There's also melted cheddar but you would never know, as it gets swallowed up by the strong flavors of everything else.

Beautiful room, a bit small but not very crowded on a thursday evening, service was great, really interesting menu.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Crepe Cellar is one of the reasons to love Charlotte.  They have one of my favorite chicken sandwiches in the black and blue po-boy, and my most recent guest finished a crepe apiece as the entree and the dessert.

It is a small venue, but I personally have not had any issues with the consistent quality like Mike K.  If you haven't been, please consider it."}
{"text":"Pesto Brie Fries - to DIE for!!!! Great customer service."}
{"text":"For the high priced end of the casual dining spectrum, I was hoping for a bit more from Crêpe Cellar. The black bean/carrot veggie burger was kind of dry, and so was the bun. The flavors were nice, but needed a little more tang or spice to really pop. The white bean and mustard greens bisque was great however, and saved my veggie burger after adding a few spoonfuls to the dry mess. My boyfriend loved his sandwich in contrast, but thought the red slaw he got tasted like the discard pulp out of a juicer. 

Our waitress was nice, the ambience an urban escape, so I think it's worth another go..."}
{"text":"There was super cute decor! The food was delicious. For a person who doesn't typically eat fries, I really enjoyed their pesto brie fries. However, some dishes were a little pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"We were in town from Houston, TX for a wedding and decided to look up a lunch spot on Yelp and ended up at the Crepe Cellar.  Thank you yelpers because we LOVED this place.


Everything from the decor to the dessert was terrific.

I started with their house blend French press coffee - so good.  My husband is a connoisseur of iced teas and I think this place topped his list.

My husband had a crepe with mushrooms, goat cheese and caramelized scallions and I had one with roasted chicken, bacon, cheddar cheese and drizzled with a roasted tomato cream.  Both were excellent.  My side salad was also great, and we both loved his hand cut french fries. 

But, I didn't finish my meal - because I decided to save room for dessert - we shared a Suzette crepe, which was gone in probably 30 seconds, both of us fighting for bites of the sauce and vanilla bean ice cream on top.

If we lived in the area we'd be back.  Wish they'd open a spot like this in Houston!"}
{"text":"This place is great, good food, friendly service, excellent homemade bloody mary's etc. Fish and chips is great, crepe's are excellent, but the breakfast / brunch menu is awesome - Kahlua dipped french toast, egg's benedict and florentine very well done and great coffee sourced locally from Dilworth Coffee.

We will be back soon..."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  I've been a couple times and find myself craving Crepe Cellar daily. 

The atmosphere and the people are great!  Like Ashley V. said, it is a small restaurant so on any night of the week you could find yourself waiting a while for a table.  But it is SO worth it! 

The Food:  

I had the daily seafood special.  It was a seared tuna steak crusted with some delicious seasonings that I can't recall (cumin could have been one).  It was cooked to perfection!  Nice and crunchy on the outside and red on the inside but still warm.  It flaked apart perfectly!  No knife needed.  And it was a big portion of tuna too - nothing wimpy.  The tuna was sitting on a bed of delicious flavorful risotto.  The plate was topped with 3 asparagus spears and surrounded with ponzu sauce that was soooo good!

For dessert, it was hard to make a decision between the strawberry/nutella crepe and the banana fosters crepe.  I went banana fosters.. The crepe was filled with the delicious rum butter sauce and covered with more of the sauce and cooked bananas.  There was a pretty good sized amount of whipped cream off to the side too.  It was warm, melty and buttery -- I loved every bite of it. 

My bill came out to be $34.00 but that included 2-$4 beers.
Crepe = $7 (one of the more expensive ones)  They range in price from $4-8 depending on add ons like ice cream and extra fruit.
The special was $17 by far the most expensive thing there.  Regular menu items are about $7-10.  

Overall: 
What are you doing still reading this?  You should be at Crepe Cellar right now!  Unless it's Monday - that's the one day they are closed."}
{"text":"I ordered a seasonal crepe, which currently contains Irish cream, bananas, and some other pieces of heaven I can't remember with vanilla bean ice cream on the side!

Because I wasn't feeling too hungry, I only went in for a desert crepe and split with a friend. However, the food there sounds amazing, and I definitely plan on going back with an empty stomach and trying out more things on their menu!

The place is a bit small but has a nice ambiance. I think it would be a great place to consider for a date night."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying a crepe however as soon as I sat down my friend said, \"So even though this is a crepe place, their crepes suck, get something else.\" Ok then, what was my next choice? They were voted best fish and chips and best fries in 2011, so I figured I couldn't go wrong. I could most likely eat french fries for my only meal for the rest of my life, so to be voted the best of the best, well.....they need to be pretty unbelievable. I ended up upgrading to the best of 2011 fries with my fish and was sorta disappointed. They were topped with pesto and brie just as the menu says, but I didn't find this to add to their flavor. If anything it took away from the yummy fries that are good just served plain. The fish was excellent. Crispy and fried perfectly. It came with a side of thinly sliced cole slaw which was ok. The service was ok although the waitress shot my friend and me a nasty look for looking at pictures on our phone together, as if we were disturbing her. The place was also very loud and when I mean loud, I had to shout at the person across from me which made me just want to eat in silence and not talk at all. I most likely would come back for the fish and chips and maybe then I'll try a dessert crepe."}
{"text":"Excellent Restaurant.  Great drinks, great dessert crepes.  We didn't try the dinner fare, as we had eaten earlier - but will be going back because everything looked fantastic!"}
{"text":"We celebrated my husband's birthday at Crepe Cellar this week.  We've been here a hand full of times and always enjoy the food and the atmosphere.  (Although this night their A/C was out and it was a bit stuffy, but still bearable.)

We started with the cheese and meat platter which was very nice!  3 different additions (fig preserves, strawberry, mustard and crostinis) to the meat and cheese. Next was the flat bread which was actually bread.  I was thinking pizza but nope - more like an open face french bread sandwich - tasty but not exactly what I was expecting.  We also had the Caesar salad which was very heavy on the anchovy.

Service was attentive yet not annoying.  Always a pleasurable experience!!"}
{"text":"Food was great! The pesto fries are fantastic with flavor, but are very soggy. So if you're looking for a crispy french fry this is not your option. Burger was outstandingly. The crepe was a bit of a disappoint and lacked a wow factor. 

I will be back"}
{"text":"My favorite spot in Charlotte. Artists in the kitchen. Super service. 

Chicken Cassoulet, French Press Coffee (complete with brewing timers in the form of an hourglass) and Bananas Foster with Nutella is the trifecta of cuisine. My wife and I go once a week. Top notch.  Added bonus is the creative vibe of The NODA District."}
{"text":"I usually eat here when I'm doing the NODA gallery crawl. It's a great spot for hanging with friends or a date... good menu, location and atmosphere. It has a nice, cozy feel and the pesto brie fries are SO. GOOD! As a chocolate lover the brownie in a blanket dessert is on my favorite list, too."}
{"text":"We have lived in Noda for 3 years and Crepe has always been our favorite restaurant in Noda. The food is amazing and so is the ambience. The burger and fish and chips are always a go to.  I tried the half chicken last night which was incredible!  We also want to give a special shoutout to our server this weekend.  Emily you were awesome!"}
{"text":"Met some friends for lunch when headed from Atlanta to Raleigh for the weekend.  They live in NoDa and picked out the place.  

It's cozy spot with dark wood, specials on the chalk board, an interesting beverage list, and a small but varied menu.  I opted for the crepe special, with broccolini.  The crepe was yummy - filling but not overly so.  It was a nice break from the usual salads and sandwiches that I eat for lunch.

Anyway, there are 2 reasons this place gets the extra star that says I'm a fan - service and soundtrack.  The people were really friendly, gave good suggestions, and very patient with us.  As for the soundtrack, I don't remember the individual songs, but I remember them all being ones that I love and that fall into that category of upbeat in a relaxing way.

All in all, definitely a great lunch spot."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes! If I are a foodie I MUST come to NoDa area of Charlotte and eat here! The cellar burger and Brie fries are off the charts!!! Their French press coffee is pretty amazing as well! NoDa is a very eclectic part of CLT. Be sure to hang around and enjoy the scene as well as the food. Best fries in Charlotte hands down..."}
{"text":"Delish! Well, I can only speak for the Spinach and Wild Mushroom Crêpe and the Mascarpone and Berries Crêpe for desert... and they certainly were delicious!
Wonderful atmosphere and ambience! Staff was quite nice, attentive and knowledgeable.
Overall, it was a great experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone who has yet to try this gem in NoDa!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. I wish I could eat here every. single. day. The menu has more than crepes, but when I go- I go for the Queen City. Absolutely delish! My husband and I go here on occasion and we love it- you really can't go wrong. I love the atmosphere- the \"low lighting\" and the service. We went there last week- and even though it was packed (not unusual) the hostess was extremely tentative and took our name down on a tablet (new, I think- great idea) and sent us a text message when our table was ready. It sits in a great spot in NoDa- so while you wait you can hit up some of the local bars (Growlers, next door). If you go for dinner you MUST try the Nutella Crepe Brownie for dessert....9/10 we have to take it home and it still tastes amazing the next day. Start off with an app. (any are wonderful) and dive into dinner- SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT! This place is a must if you live in/near/are visiting Charlotte."}
{"text":"The excellent!:

1) service
2) atmosphere
3) location 
4) bang for your buck
5) dessert / ALWAYS order dessert

The mediocre:

1) buck wheat dinner crepe (far too heavy and grain-y) dream of a day they do away with this!
2) tri fold of crepes (limits contents/go with a roll)
3) unnecessary information on specials (details can be great but too much and gets awkward)
4) pesto fries while unique are always burnt"}
{"text":"Born in NC I feel I know my grits, biscuits, etc... The biscuits here are flaky, buttery and a good size! The grits are on point! It's rare I don't have to doctor-up my grits (pepper, salt and butter) but these were so well-cooked and seasoned I didn't need to do a thing. 
I tried my friends brussel sprouts and pesto fries and both of those dishes were tasty as well.
The place itself is cool but neighborly; I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"When I won a raffle at a Charlotte Checkers game earlier this season, one of the two prizes was a gift card for Crepe Cellar.  We used it for our early Valentine's Day dinner and we really enjoyed it.  We were also hungry after walking from the near Midtown to Freedom Park and back.  

We arrived in Noda at 5:30 or so.  Like all \"this is a cool and older neighborhood\", parking can be difficult.  We found a spot in the tiny lot behind the restaurant.  

Upon entering we found a small table for two in the small place.  The place only has a few tables and small bar, but it is somewhat efficient.  I saw they had Heineken on tap (a rarity) and for only $4, I gladly obliged.  My wife had the house red wine which she said was good.

Our waitress, Alex, was very nice.  We started with a cheese plate.  Yummy Maytag, aged cheddar, sliced beef and prosciutto hat actually didn't taste salty.  There was some crostini, strawberries, and candied walnuts too.  The cheese plate could have been a small meal for one person we ordered more.

I had spinach, mushroom, and goat cheese crepe which was very tasty and large.  It was served with fries which were phenomenal.  They were the perfect size, flavor, texture, and crispiness and would have went great with malt vinegar.  My wife had a small salad, cheese grits, and about 1/4 of my crepe.  By this time were stuffed so we did not get dessert ( a few people were also waiting so we wanted to be polite and let them sit down and eat). However I noticed that several desserts are served with Nutella which to me is not good.  There are few things of which I don't like the flavor but hazelnut is one of them.  

All in all, our experience at Crepe Cellar was very good from the food to the service to the drinks to the atmosphere.  I am glad I won that gift card otherwise I may never have tried it.  The prices are also very reasonable with the crepes being $8-9 but you can also get more price items like steak or shrimp and grits."}
{"text":"Crepes for dinner is completely new to me, but I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. I had the crepe du jour which included roasted chicken,  chorizo,  and black beans inside along with the fried brussel sprouts as a side. It was so delicious I never even thought about taking a pic. If you have a sweet tooth, the crepe suzette is a great choice."}
{"text":"Desert crepes are excellent and must have.  Dinner crepes are good but not great.  Mussels were very good as well.  Chimay on tap so cannot beat that."}
{"text":"I have been putting off writing this for a long time. Largely because it is my most visited and most familiar 'special occasion' restaurant. I think it's a lot easier to write about one given experience, but to aggregate dozens of different visits into one straightforward review is a little bit more challenging! Let's give it a go.

First of all, when you walk in you're immersed in a very intimate atmosphere that maybe you weren't expecting in the NoDa neighborhood. This spot is great for friends catching up with each other or date night with your significant other. Seating at the bar is first come first served, while the wait times for dining room seating has improved with recent renovations/expansion to the rear of the restaurant.

I highly suggest the seasonal cocktails they feature on the constantly rotating menu, their bar staff is top notch and they even age their own Burbon!

For starters, if it's your first time here, no question you've got to try the award winning (Charlotte Magazine) pesto brie fries. The pesto that's served with it adds such a bold flavor that contrasts well with the mellow creaminess of the brie, it's a true delight.

Make sure to check out the specials. They do a weekly special crepe, seafood dish, Mussel, soup, and veg, which they list on a board near the back of the restaurant, but your server should go over them as well. Barring any showstoppers on the special menu, I always know what I'm in the mood for: Slow roasted short rib, served with a cabernet reduction, with heirloom tomatoes and roasted shallots. If you think I copied and pasted that from the menu you'd be wrong, I've ordered this so many times it's burned in my brain! Every bite is pure perfection, I'm serious, I could just die right there with no regrets after finishing a plate of this.

You may be wondering where the crepes are in this review. To be honest, I love the entree crepe dishes, but I like to save the crepe for dessert. They make an outstanding crepe suzette with a creamy sauce finished with grand mariner and topped with the most amazing ice cream. I'll say no more, words cannot do this dish any justice.

At the end of the night, before you leave, pause a minute to just savor the atmosphere. Friends and family enjoying each others company, the passers-by reveling in a fun night in NoDa, and the hustle of the amazing kitchen churning out stellar food all blend together like a symphony. It's a curious experience for me every time, and I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"So glad this place is in our neighborhood!  But please bring back the chicken the way you used to do it!  Shepard's pie is stupid good too, or is it Guiness Pie?  They have great specials and it's like an upscale pub atmosphere. Super friendly staff. They make the experience special. Great for a date!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner this weekend and the wait was about an hour and fifteen minutes, we were able to put our name in and they would just send us a text letting us know our table was ready which is pretty great. That meant we could leave and go to another place for a drink if we had wanted to. Luckily there was room at the bar for us so we ordered a drink and the pesto fries appetizer while we waited. The fries were delicious and the pesto was amazing. So good I decided to order the pesto pasta as my entree and I am so glad I did. The pasta sauce was also very creamy which I loved. My husband ordered the fish and chips and tried a few bites of it as well, it was great with wonderful flaky crust. Their tartar sauce was amazing. My best friend ordered their burger which I didn't try because I don't eat beef but she said it was delicious. I will be going here again in the future."}
{"text":"One of the best additions to the NoDa neighborhood over the last year or so.
If you are going the crepe route for dining, hit up the Queen City.  If you are going for dessert, you cannot go wrong with the brownie concoction.
The menu is also delicious well beyond the crepe realm.  The steak and Guiness stew with the insanely good mac and cheese will hit the spot.  For lighter fare, I recommend the pesto chicken french bread pizza.
The beer selection (especially on tap) is always evolving and refreshing no matter what your taste.
The wait staff and bartenders are friendly and fun."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere with very good service.  Interesting menu.  Not just creeps.  Not a fan of buckwheat flour which is what all their savory creeps are made from.    I had the ham and guryere creep which need something else to make it different.  I can make ham and cheese at home.  Fries were over cooked.  I will try it again because they have lovely ingredients.  Sam P."}
{"text":"Omg this place is a hidden gem!!! Best food and specials!! My new fav!!! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"We probably go here once a month. Great neighborhood, good food and great beers and wine by the glass, all at a reasonable price. It's one of our few go-to's that isn't in the super pricey category.  Park across the street behind the building with the Fifth Third bank in it if you can't find space on the street or in the small lot behind the restaurant.  Cool kids pass their ticket to those coming in and save a new friend the $5!

Atmosphere is cozy and casual. Have been there plenty of times when all tables are full and never too loud. 

French onion soup is a good preparation and the bowl is a massive cheesy crock of goodness. 

Steak frites with Hangar steak as the cut is delicious. Always order med rare and it always comes out that way. Fries are delicious hand cut shoestrings. Great pan sauce served atop. Always a winner and fairly priced around $23. Very big portion. 

I love the burger there. Fancy cheese and crispy fried onion strings. Great bun and served with the aforementioned fries for $12 is a good one. 

Daily muscles special that works well as a big app or a small dinner. Never had a bad one and they serve with nice crusty bread to sop up the sauce. 

Beer list is always impressive and changing, and I like that they have a lengthy list of wines by the glass all for $6.

Crepes Suzette for desert is so, so good.  Not too sweet and have to try a crepe when you're there."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Queen City crepe, Guinness pie, fish and chips all delicious. Great draft beer menu. Cool relaxed atmosphere and service is good."}
{"text":"Outstanding desserts!  We went for a walk to find something different and found it!  The brownie crepe was decadent and the Orange chocolate moose was light as air.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good service, and good food. Don't forget to check out the specials on the chalk board. The burger is unexpectedly good for a place called the Crepe Place. Also don't leave without trying one of the deserts."}
{"text":"The Banana Foster's in the Bomb Digity times infinity!!"}
{"text":"Crepe Cellar has an awesome ambiance.  I love the cozy feel with exposed wood and chalkboard specials on the wall. The service is top-notch with knowledgeable, friendley servers and talented bartenders.  

But, for a crepe restaurant, I really don't care for their crepes.  I find them somewhat dry and a bit bland.  I do, however, like the rest of their menu quite a bit.  They have a mussels special everyday that never disappoints.  There's a flatbread pizza special that is enjoyable.  The arugula salad with balsamic, fig dressing is a-mazing.  

It can get busy here, but I can consistently get a table without a wait if I go early-ish (like 5:30).  If you have a wait, there's plenty of places in NoDa to enjoy a drink before your dinner."}
{"text":"Wow. I've been here before and it was great, but the last couple of visits were not great.  The cheese plate flavors do not blend at all.  It used to be so good. The onion soup had very little flavor, just a sprinkle of cheese, and tasted gelatin like. Half the mussels were closed on the plate and in general it seemed like the chef was doing a lot of shopping at Costcos. I've become acustomed to better from this place. hope to see some change for the better again!"}
{"text":"I have only been here during lunch hours so that is what my review is based on. 

I have been here multiple times and each time it was a fantastic experience. The service has always been great. The beer selection is pretty good, though the last time I was here ti wasnt as good. I have been when it was really busy and when we were the only ones in there and still get the same great service. 

I have had the pesto brie fries a few times and they were really good each time. Some of the best Pesto i have ever had. 

The burger is great, not a huge fan of aioli so i get it without, and has tasted fresh and great every time. I have had it with and without bacon and prefer it without bacon. The bacon takes away from the flavor for some reason. 

My absolute favorite food here is their Mac and Cheese. Now I am extremely picky when it comes to Mac and Cheese and theirs is amazing. I have had it almost every time and it is always great. I do prefer to eat it hot and not let it cool so much. 

I have had the bananna fosters crepe as well and it was good. It was a little different than I expected so I think it caught me off guard but it was good and I would eat it again. 

Give the place a try!"}
{"text":"What an amazing find for breakfast and lunch. I cannot remember when I have had coffee so good it made me stop conversation and take notice. The French press coffee comes with its own timer so you can brew it perfectly to your tastes. The food is exceptional. (we plan to here tomorrow, it's that good). We opted for two of the savory buckwheat crepes. The turkey apple brie is perfectly balance the the light and delicate flavors all complementing each other. The ham and Gruyere cheese with the maple Dijon glaze was hearty and flavorful. The chef is obviously a musician creating a symphony of flavors! The sides were good enough to be stand alone. Definitely try the purple slaw and if you love brussel sprouts, they are a must. We did not try any of the home craft cocktails but the menu was impressive."}
{"text":"Really...really delicious crepes.  I had the Turkey Apple Brie Buckwheat crepe. So good. And the service was great too! Parking is difficult to find, but drive around until you find a spot. This place is worth it! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sunday lunch here - I went for the eggs Benedict, my date had the buckwheat crepe with salmon. We had mimosas to accompany the meal. Everything was really good. We started with the flash fried Brussels sprouts which were a great choice, and we had sides of the home fries (cooked to perfection), and cheese grits.  I did start with a Bloody Mary, which ended too spicy for me, but our serve Dustin was very nice about it and took care of us. He also had great menu recommendations!  Thanks Dustin!

We were too full for dessert, so we will have to make a special visit for that!"}
{"text":"Best burger of my life!!!  The Mac and cheese was to die for as well.  I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Out of curiosity I will return, but not in a hurry.  I am pretty sure I have had real crepes before and they were not supposed to be mushy and thick.  It's supposed to be thin, light, and crisp.  I loved the drink menu; lots of great wines, beers, ciders, etc. and at reasonable prices.  I am actually more intrigued by their soups and appetizers.  A really delicous looking salad came out while I was picking over my dough ball pillow crepe with ham tucked somewhere inside.  I brought my leftovers home and put them on the foreman grill and it tasted much better.  The ambience and decor is really dark and romantic; I think it would make a great first date location.  The irony is I just did not like the crepes..."}
{"text":"After an initial bout of extreme disappointment learning the fryers were down when we arrived, we decided to stick around. i had planned on getting Fish and Chips  and/or Pesto Brie French Fries so that was a no go. Instead i went with an actual crepe (my first ever?), it appears to be like the French version of a quesadilla or your standard American wrap. I did enjoy it and would probably recommend it. It was the Queen City with chicken, bacon, cheddar and a tasty sauce. Each bite was flavorful. As my side i ordered the corn and zucchini succotash which they did charge $1 upgrade from the fries that come with it despite the fries not being available. Whatever. And yes, i was called out as i was about to say \"sufferin succotash.\" Come on, how could you not be thinking it.  

Sampled the mac n cheese and it just wasn't for me. Maybe it wasn't my kind of cheese but it seemed extremely bland, blah and drab. The steak and Guinness Pie was good. i was just sampling it, but would like for the veggies to be bigger or more plentiful.

The banana fosters was alright, the banana parts were good, but it's just not my favorite type of dessert and actually wouldn't be in my first ten choices for dessert.  

The place does have limited seating and while we were eating during their transition to dinner time it appeared one of the tables that sat down was forgotten about as the servers changed. Seems tough to do with the limited number of tables.All the tables were full and i almost felt bad that we had gotten dessert and were finishing the coffee as people stood a few feet away waiting on a table. 
Seriously, does every restaurant have to have a tv?"}
{"text":"These are Huge Crepes!

Twice I have eaten Crepes Suzette twice here!  Both times as a Dessert!!!  I would eat this as a meal and would not be bragging about it (not be bragging that it was a meal for a person who is always on a \"diet\" - always BREAKING a diet)!  I'm guessing this is the Best Dessert in NoDa?  Best one I remember and only one I am suggesting right now!

Once we had a Crepe with Sausage was very good too!  We may have asked for the Sausage to be added!

Same Dude Severed us each time and does a great job!

Very Comfortable place!  Nicer than my Apartment for sure! Usually we get here before the Crowd!"}
{"text":"Came by for lunch on a Friday and found great lunch specials, great beer and wine options, local coffee and tea, and delicious food. The crepes are huge and the sides are generous. Everything was very fresh. Great atmosphere and decor, fantastic service."}
{"text":"Not only great atmosphere and food, but excellent service too!

It was out first time going out to NoDa for the studio crawl and we saw this little gem on our adventure. It is an intimate space perfect for families, small get-togethers and dates. Definitely somewhere I would take newcomers.

After putting our name down on the electronic waitlist, we were accidentally notified our table was ready. But we waited patiently outside until another table was available. A few minutes later we were brought inside and given an appetizer on the house. Not that it was an inconvenience at all, but it was a very generous gesture and worth the wait. We had the notable pesto brie fries--delicious especially for the french fry fanatics.

AND I accidentally left my cellphone on the table. And instead of having lost it for the night [or possibly forever] I was chased down and given it back. The best.

Must visit on so many different levels!"}
{"text":"Overall pretty good - nice variety of offerings - my complete review: http://tastefullygigi.blogspot.com/"}
{"text":"Finally made it for dinner with friends! I was the only first timer and happy to learn about the special under $25 wine list. We split two bottles among 5 of us and it was the perfect amount. To shared the burrata start, it was creamy flavorful and the perfect compliment to the grilled bread. Our waiter was nice enough to make sure we had extra bread so that we could all share. I had the spinach and wild mushroom crepe, while I appreciated that they use buckwheat for their savory crepes I didn't find this to be the best or most authentic rendition, however it was good. I paired it with the house salad, which was plentiful for a side portion, and quite fresh and delicious. Another friend ordered the crepe stuffed with a brownie and topped with ice cream, I had a bite and it was amazing, the brownie was so moist! Overall, we had a wonderful time and everyone was pleased with the food and service. It worked out well for a small group but also has an intimate vibe that would be great for a date or special occasion. I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"What a Great atmosphere for a date. Worth checking out purely for the lighting (go at night for dinner!). The drinks are good and my hat's off to the cooks. Definitely thumbs up on just about everything, especially service. Really worth checking out if you're looking for something different. Not sure what to recommend purely because everything is so different... it really comes down to your personal taste. 

I'd definitely go here again. Only downside is parking can get competitive in NODA depending on when you go, so you might have to walk a little unless you get lucky."}
{"text":"5 star for the Pesto Bri Cheese fries which is a new favorite among appetizers in Charlotte

4 star for the rest of the food 

We split the Queen City crepe which had roasted chicken, bacon, cheddar, tomatoes and an oven roasted tomato dressing. Also got the beef short rib over potato herb gnocchi with roasted tomatoes, shallots, and Cabernet reduction. 

Awesome music, great service, and good atmosphere"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the atmosphere and the decor of the restaurant. Very clean and friendly wait staff, and they were also prompt for a Wednesday dinner time. The food was delicious. I recommend the Queen City crepes with fries. The draft selection was mediocre, but I could pick out some of my go to brews. Great place for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"P.E.I Muscles were AMAZING! Huge portion for $14 can't beat it. It had bacon & apples in a white wine cream sauce, absolutely to die for! I also got the spinach and wild mushroom crepe it was excellent as well. Can't wait to return and try desert!"}
{"text":"Another first visit on my Charlotte cuisine bucket list.  Without a reservation policy, I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't difficult to seat my party of five; mostly set up for 4-tops. Great selections, presentations & taste!  Staff was friendly once they warmed up to you.  Recommend for a neighborly experience; free on-street parking."}
{"text":"I'm not one to write negative reviews, but this evening I was very disappointed in the service here. My boyfriend & I have frequented here 2 times before. We were very pleased with everything. However tonight, when I was solo, I sat at the bar. I wasn't acknowledged until 5 minutes later. After that,  I was told by the bartender that I would receive a water while I browsed the wine list. 12 minutes later, a couple beside of me received waters before I did, while the bartender was their making their cocktails. After several minutes of waiting, with only a menu and no drink or water.  I hope that this was just a really off night, because I'm sure that's not normal."}
{"text":"Really good food but horrible service. Our waitress constantly ignored us and every other table in the place. Didn't refill drinks, walked right past us with the pitcher of water, circled the room with it, yet refilled nothing. Waited over ten minutes to get a box that i had to ask the other waitress for and then another ten to get the check. Although i made eye contact with the cooks in the back of the house about six times letting them know i was ready the message did not get passed on. The only thing this waitress did do was talk and talk and talk to her coworkers about Matthew Mcconaughey  with her back towards the customers. If you want to eat here get it to go. Great food but i will not come back."}
{"text":"The food here is creative and very rich. Be prepared to not only eat a unique meal but also to pack in hundreds of calories, perhaps pushing past a thousand! Located in the little hipster nabe Noda (dumb NY wannabe real estate names that stick...sigh), which, despite its name IS cool, especially for the CLT. 

My party and I started with the pesto fries, which I'm less sure were \"pesto\" proper than the ingredients of pesto infused into the fries. A delicious, greasy snack. We also had the brussel sprouts which were fantastic. Less great was the shrimp something in a cup and a loaf of baked bread. Wasn't quite sure what was supposed to go on there. Shrimp something on the bread? It was okay, just unclear what I was eating (and probably partly my fault as I didn't order it!)

With my meal, which was the burger, which was fine and straight down the middle of the plate, I had a Scottish IPA, which was very good.

Overall, the service here was kind, friendly, and good. Not \"hipster\" service at all (which would be aloof and too cool and annoyed that I have to even work here at all to supplement the support of my self-indulgent hobbies-ZING!)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ended up here at nearly 11:30 pm on a Saturday night. It wasn't crowded but the atmosphere was lively. We had wanted to get a drink and dessert, but when we were told the kitchen closed at 11pm, we hesitated but decided to get a drink anyway. Alex (the bartender) told us to hold on while she double-checked with the kitchen, and when she came back, she told us that the kitchen would make a dessert for us, which was a very nice surprise. 

We ordered the Brownie in a Blanket, and WOW. If you're looking for a decadent dessert at the end of a rough day, this dessert will make all your troubles go away. The crepes were perfectly cooked, and the Nutella, brownie and candied walnuts were an exceptional addition to them. They went very well with my perfectly-made Old Fashioned too! All in all, a wonderful first-time visit to Crepe Cellar. I will definitely be back for dinner sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast crepe. Love the atmosphere and neighborhood. Great spot for brunch."}
{"text":"If nothing else, get the pesto Brie fries. Please!! The bar staff are extremely friendly, which only added to the experience. Also got the burrata which is house made by the chef, and well made at that. Definitely give this place a try next time you're in NoDa."}
{"text":"I came for a week visit in north carolina, my friends took me to this place and it was amazing. I ordered the sausage baguette pizza and pest brie fries with a nice white wine. everything was delish. next time i come to charlotte i must come here. Service was also nice and friendly. The brownie dessert crepe was to die for.."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visit charlotte for a few days and had dinner at this hidden gem.  I had the ham and guryere crepe with a side of mac and cheese (the bomb), my boyfriend got the arugula salad with salmon.  The food and service was fantastic.  Alex was our waitress and she was the sweetest thing ever!  She was knowledgeable and I was never without a drink.  A must try place!"}
{"text":"This place is a small cozy little crepe cafe with a good atmosphere and good crepes. My boyfriend and I sat at the bar and we each ordered a crepe each even after having dinner already.  It was a sweet and delightful banana and nutella crepe which I enjoyed very much.  

I wish i knew the restaurant served savory dishes as well, then I wouldn't of had dinner at some other place before stumbling upon this gem!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch. Will definitely go back.

Parking can be a challenge, but worth it."}
{"text":"My husband and I ended up here after Cabo Fish Taco told us there would be a 30 min wait. We were pleasantly surprised when we walked in The Crepe Cellar. Beautiful and simple decor. Cozy. Nice bar. Not loud like Cabo. Our server Katherine was knowledgeable and relaxed. She was very nice too! She told us all of her favorites and we chose to start with steamed mussels, endive salad and had burgers for our meal. They were all killer. 

Don't let the name mislead you- they have all kinds of other amazing food other than crepes. All of the food we tried was fantastic, perfectly cooked and served promptly. Perfect date night spot where you can actually hear your date talk without having to shout. The only small complaint I have is that because our table was in the aisle servers kept bumping into the back of my chair each time they passed. Next time I'll ask for a booth ;-)"}
{"text":"One of the most interesting food spots in Charlotte.

But I never actually get a crepe here?..

The specials always look amazing, and we ALWAYS get whatever the mussels preparation is.

I haven't ever had a bad meal, or known someone who wasn't totally satisfied by coming here.

NOTE: Great spot to mix wine and appetizers if you're in the mood to pick at lots of different things!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  The spinach and mushroom crepe was excellent!  The cole slaw was sweet and extremely good and the French onion soup was some of the best I've ever had. Great environment, friendly service, and very clean restaurant. The mixed drinks are very good as well. The blackberry basil fizz is great (you can taste the basil in it). Definitely coming back to this place. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I just randomly decided to stop here as I was walking through NoDa with a friend and I gotta say, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was fairly late, but we were still greeted with a welcoming smile and the waitress sat us and was probably one of the sweetest girls I've ever met.

We had the pesto fries which were super tasty. I had the Ham Gruyere crepe and I have to say, was delicious. My friend had \"The Queen City\" crepe and said it was awesome.

All in all, awesome service, we stayed a little past closing time and they were super gracious to us. Thanks for the good time!

The restaurant was very nicely decorated inside and super clean. Definitely a cool place to check out."}
{"text":"Yesterday 4 of my friends went to this place. Just 2 of us drank a coffee and ate a crepe and we got sick a few hours later. Really bad food poisoning that lasted several hours.

I usually don't write reviews but I think this is something people should know."}
{"text":"Its great and cute for quirky dates  just make sure u come at a reasonable time, gets quite busy"}
{"text":"We've tried to eat here 3 times and every time the utter rudeness of the hostess staff has driven us out. Tonight we were actually seated and then UN-seated. She said she made a mistake! If you seat me, that is your fault not mine, but you DON'T aske me to get up once I have been seated. So we had a wonderful dinner at Boudreauxs down the street where we were actually welcome!

These hostesses learn their behavior from their superiors - management."}
{"text":"Not the best crepes but the sides were freaking fantastic. I would definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Since I'm review #193, I'll keep it short-ish. We ventured in on a Friday evening; I'd always pictured more of a bakery inside, but it was the cutest, quaintest restaurant with candles lining the window, cozy lighting, and a comfy bar, which is where we sat.

We started with the Brussels sprouts - the whole reason we went - and they were divine. For dinner, the fella got the fish and chips, which were way too big for the plate they came on! He said it was pretty tasty. I got the ham and Gruyere cheese crepe, which had a sweet maple drizzle on top... yum. Then we had to get the nutella and banana crepe. The fella got one bite, which I thought was very generous of me. 

I'm not always a crepe fan since they usually seem too heavy or too light, but Crepe Cellar is just right. I hate that it took us this long to get there, and now I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place. On a day trip to Charlotte, my sister, my boyfriend, and I stopped by for Sunday brunch. My sister and I had just come back from our trip to Paris, and we were really craving some crepes after having authentic ones from France. The result? Utter disappointment.

Don't get me wrong, the dishes other than the crepes seem to be pretty good. We all ordered the Pesto Brie French Fries to share as an appetizer. Though I thought it to be way too oily (both form the pesto and the double-fry on the potato), the flavor of the pesto mixed with the cheese was really spot on. My sister and boyfriend both ordered non-crepe dishes, and they enjoyed their brunch experience much more than I did. My sister ordered the Kahlua Batter French Toast, and she loved it. The toast itself had a really great amount of moistness without being too soggy. I didn't taste much of the kahlua flavor when I tried the toast, but it was still a pretty good french toast. The side sausage was too spicy and too dry for her taste, but the homefries were really crispy - probably because they are fried - and were quite flavorful. My boyfriend ordered the Eggs Florentine, and it was tasty as well. The french baguette was crispy, and the egg was perfectly poached. He did say that the smoked salmon underneath the egg cooked a little too much and became too dry. Otherwise, a pretty solid dish.

My experience, on the other hand, was far from ideal. I had the Smoked Salmon Breakfast Crepe, and it just didn't remind me of a crepe at all but more like a breakfast burrito. I clearly asked the waitress to remove the caramelized shallots from my dish, and when I actually dug into my crepe, there were SO MANY shallots. That wasn't my main complaint though. Smoked salmon just shouldn't be cooked in my opinion, and the salmon in my crepe was cooked way too much - became way too dry and lost all the appeal of smoked salmon to begin with. In addition, I thought the eggs in my crepe were really... runny and soggy for some reason, and not in a good way, since they were supposed to be scrambled. The crepe itself had specks of black dots along it (buckwheat maybe?), but it was much too thick and didn't have the flavorful appeal of the better crepes that I've had. I couldn't even finish a fourth of my crepe since it was just too unappetizing. Another huge problem came with the side of grits that I ordered - it was definitely microwaved. There was a layer of film all along the top and the sides of my grits that makes it obvious when something of that consistency is microwaved. Such a disappointment.

This review is purely based on my personal experiences with Crepe Cellar even though I do acknowledge that the other people I came with had much better experiences. I just don't think I can overlook the horribly made crepe and the microwaved grits. If you are to come here, trust me and stay away from the savory crepes."}
{"text":"I think this place gives you a lot of what the neighborhood is about. (I can say that as a local) Friendly, down to earth staff, great food, intimate feel and decor. Great for dates and introducing people to Charlotte! Food is awesome! I went their the other night and had the Chicken Black and Blue sandwich... That was a whole nother level of yumminess! And the dessert crepes are just freaking phenomenal! These people know what they're doin! It's small though, so keep the kids at home. And parking can be an issue on a busy night in the neighborhood. But I think its worth the hassle! Definitely a recommended spot! :)"}
{"text":"It took us forever to find a restaurant with under an hour wait on a Saturday night.  Crepe Cellar was a good 20 minute wait (thank you!).  I decided to get the special crepe of the day (With spinach, smoked salmon, asparagus) because we were in CREPE Cellar.  The crepe is gluten free and tasted a bit weird to me.  The smoked salmon was really salty.  Overall, not a great meal.  I now wish I ordered their entree instead because they looked interesting."}
{"text":"Cute place in NoDa, Food was great just a little pricey. I had the grits which tasted perfect! The Brie fries was also good just a little bit oily! But otherwise than that everything was great."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great date spot! Hit up Crepe Cellar even if you are just going for French Pressed Coffee and Brownie in a Blanket. You won't be disappointed both are delicious!"}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in a long time. Left feeling too full to move! Had the pesto brie fries as an appetizer and the savory spinach, mushroom, and goat cheese crepe as well. For dessert I definitely recommend grabbing the seasonal pumpkin pie crepe before it's gone!"}
{"text":"In our ongoing search for the best burger in town, I am happy to report that we have another candidate from a MOST unexpected source!  So the story goes:  

A few Sundays ago we were getting ready for the week and musing about how good it would be to have a great burger before the work week started.  I texted a good Friend an asked for something in our neighborhood as I didn't feel like driving across town.  my inquiry for the best burger close to the \"hood\" (we live in Midwood) was to go to the Crepe Cellar in NoDa!  I thought she had misread my text for a moment but she followed up with details before I could ask about how I also needed to have the fries topped with brie and pesto.  A little bit shocked (and wondering how much champagne said friend had intaken that day) we pile din the car and off we went.  Now I have been to the CC for brunch on multiple occasions and found it to be divine... but to think that a crepe joint might have the best burger was still not computing.  We actually found a parking spot out front and were greeted and seated by he pleasant staff in a matter of minutes.

As a brunch patron I never realized that what was on the rest of the menu and I sure didn't have a clue that they had a great beer list!!!  We ordered a really great Scottish IPA (a SIPA? LOL) on draught and the fried brussel sprouts for an app... happily both were amazing!!!  I kept saying I was done with the brussel sprouts and kept going back in for more.  While gorging ourselves on said brussel sprouts we ordered our burgers and when they arrived and we cut them in half you could immediately tell that this place was not playing around!!!  The meat was beautiful and cooked perfectly on the rare side of medium rare.  The fries (as mentioned earlier with the Brie and pesto) also were crazy good... and may be contenders for the best fries in the city as well!!!  All in all we were pleasantly shocked to death and will make the trip back many times in the future to enjoy these crazy good delicacies again!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot for date night without having to break the bank. The Queen City crepe and the oysters were good. You can't go wrong with Pesto Brie fries!"}
{"text":"I was in town for business and decided to have dinner at a different spot but wanted to try out the sweet crepes here for dessert. I stopped in to get a togo order and it took less than 10 minutes. I ordered the Bananas Foster crepe and it was delicious! 

The restaurant looked a little empty but it was after 9pm on a Tuesday so I didn't want to judge it by that."}
{"text":"Easily the best food in NoDa- maybe the best in CLT. I had the ginger loves Serrano cocktail- which was a fresher, tastier margarita- it was a bit overpriced, but was a good drink. Pesto Brie fries are great - a really unique combination of flavored.  The brussel sprouts are amazing- great texture. The short ribs were fork tender with a delicious sauce and pillow soft gnocchi. BF had fish & chips- flaky and high quality. We split the brownie crepe- so rich and delicious! The absolute best part was the service - Catherine did a great job and was a lot of fun. Their team approach to service ensured efficiency, and every server was just as warm and friendly as Catherine. Can't wait to see the expanded dining area!"}
{"text":"It is hard to describe but I feel so not in Charlotte when I go to Crepe Cellar.  I think it is the gorgeous counter and the exposed beams, just the feel of the place is more NYC.  Have been here many times but here recently with a friend and I realized I have never reviewed it!!

The sangria here is fantastic.... a summer must.  My favorite item on the menu has to be the Pesto Chicken pizza.  It has sun-dried tomatoes, pesto, tender chicken on a crisp crust.  Perfect to share!  I have had a few of the crepes (Queen City and the Ham & Gruyere) which were good.  I definitely prefered the flavors of the Queen City and who can go wrong with a crepe that has bacon???  I look forward to coming back again and again since it is so close to Uptown.  Overall very consistent food and service!  Love it!  :-D"}
{"text":"We were very excited to go back here for dinner due tonour last experience being so good.  We went with another couple who also love this restaurant. It has been a long time since any of us visited here.  We all wanted the mussels ofcourse cause they r known for those as well as the crepes.  We ordered apps meat and cheeses whch were good. Then here is where it begins.  We order the mussels \"sorry we ran out\" ohhhhhhK we will take the pork belly \"sorry we ran out\" fine. We both ordered the crepes, 1 mushroom and 1 ham and a side of brussel sprouts.  Then i order a glass of wine.  Sorry, \"we ran out\"   OMG.  Waited forever for drinks, service was average at best.  Ok here comes our crepes which were overcooked and then \"sorry we ran out of brussel sprouts\" This is insane, the whole experience and quality of food and service was just bad."}
{"text":"First time in NODA in years and years. Was anxious to see the development and new stuff going on up there.   The Crepe Cellar is not new; it has been around for about ten years. I don't think I had eaten there before, so Janet, my cousin-in-law,  and I decided to travel some distance to check it out. The place was fabulous.  Outstanding food. Outstanding ambiance. Outstanding service. Everything was in perfect order and I loved it, until the bill arrived. We both had the Crepe du Jour, which had chicken and beans and other fresh ingredients that made our taste buds dance.  The price of this special was not on the blackboard, so I assumed it was in line with the other prices on the menu.  Turns out, each crepe was $16.  Now, let me remind you, this was NOT a fresh catch of the day.  This was a C R E P E.  I don't blame them for not putting the price on the board!   I had a side of Brussel sprouts and misunderstood that a side was NOT included with the meal. The Brussel Sprouts, however, were amazing and worth the miles to get to this restaurant.  And the iced tea, which was the best I've had in ages, was fresh and so tasty, but $3.00 a glass was simply too much. I probably wouldn't gripe about $2.00 a glass.  In conclusion, a $50 lunch was NOT what I had in mind for the two of us.  Clearly, it was overpriced, even if the food was terrific.  Even if the atmosphere was terrific.   Oh, it turns out the owner has four restaurants right there together in NODA.   Obviously he has a great thing going and with his special crepes going for $16, he must be amongst the very rich and famous in the Queen City.   Go check out this restaurant, but take your fat wallet with you!"}
{"text":"I think the Shrimp & Grits is the best thing on the menu! Nice small cozy restaurant...great for a date ;)"}
{"text":"This was the last restaurant my boyfriend and I went to during our visit in Charlotte. We ended on a very good note. The atmosphere is beautiful, great for a first date, anniversary or just a girls night out. The exposed brick with the menu board was very informative. The tea light made it romantic. We started with the burrata which is made in house and it was delicious. I got the burger which was amazing, the garlic aioli made the burger. My boyfriend got the chicken crepe which was also very tasty. So dessert we got banana, strawberry and Nutella. Perfect way to end the meal."}
{"text":"Have been before and have always been pleased with the food and service. This being said, my last visit my entire order was incorrect. However, the bartender not only corrected everything but never once made me or my friend feel out of place or uncomfortable. By far, great food and great service. Will absolutely return."}
{"text":"Situated in Noda (Charlotte's equivalent of Philadelphia's South Street), Crepe Cellar strives to cater to the gastropub gourmand while offering a casual atmosphere and good drinking. 

I'll begin by saying that my overall experience (and that of my friends) was very enjoyable. The staff was friendly, the selection of alcohol was diverse and the food had its highs and lows. 

I applaud this restaurant's efforts in offering gourmet dishes in a pub scene. It is rare to see many pubs around here moving away from the stereotypical american bar. Example: Beef Short Rib over Potato Herb Gnocchi with roasted tomatoes, shallots, and cabernet reduction. Sounds delicious, and it was! But there are other items that attempt to push the envelope and miss completely. The pan seared duck breast not only had a \"gamey\" taste, but the \"Korean BBQ Sauce\" that was drizzled over it had no resemblance to anything from that country (neither the North nor the South). In fact, the taste was so familiar to me that I pinpointed it directly to the sweet chili sauce that you dip your Chinese take-out spring rolls in. And for the $22 this place is demanding for such a dish, I was sorely disappointed. As for the steak and frites, the meat was cooked nice and pink and the red wine sauce had a deep and velvety richness to it. The fries are good for mopping up the leftover sauce.

I think if you're making a trip all the way out here though, you should just stick to the crepes because the dessert that followed was perfection. We decided to split three different crepes to experience a variety of flavors and the choice was well made. We chose the mascarpone with berries, the crepe suzette (grand marnier, delicious), and the banana nutella. Everyone knows that the filling is a big deal, but it becomes irrelevant if the the crepe that holds it is structurally unsound, overly doughy, or rough and grainy. Crepe Cellar lives up to its name. The crepes were perfect. They were smooth, light, golden, and salted just enough to bring out the flavors they were showcasing. Of all the three, the Crepe Suzette was by far the best. It had a little \"pool\" of Grand Marnier underneath, which I imagine was flambeed, and a small ball of vanilla ice cream was placed on top. The combination was a deliciously sweet, creamy, alcoholy flavor that one could probably keep eating non-stop. 

I would definitely come back here to try the savory crepes and I would encourage others to do the same. Don't expect an intimate date though, it can get quite loud in the evening!

{"text":"My dearest corned beef hash,

After so long searching in this metropolis, I have found you. I have suffered through the costly, fake, canned wannabes: the ones that were honest about their slop worthy version of your coveted, worthwhile, savory goodness. I can say it was worth it. You were worth it.

Your perfectly seasoned hand cut home fries make my mouth water. Your cooked to perfection hand carved corned beef make my eyes shine with tears of joy. And your caramelized onions, and roasted red peppers?! Love, I have found true love in the Queen City.

But you wish for the chase. Only appearing once a month. That is okay, I can be patient. For the day the hostess answers and tells me you will be there on that Sunday morning brunch, so shall I my sweet cherished corn beef hash. So shall I.

Until next time my love."}
{"text":"My first visit here and I must say I'm impressed.  Not so much with the fact that seating can be hard to come by but the food.  The food was just great.  Twice fried fries for starters, I seriously couldn't stop eating them!  So good!  Then for the main meal my girlfriend and I split one of the flat bread pizzas and I promise you it was more than enough for the two of us.  Large amount and I'm a pretty big eater so that's saying something.  Service was courteous and we were immediatley greeted with a smile.  I love NoDa area places, don't know what it is, but the vibe is good 9 times out of 10.  Crepe Cellar is no exception to this :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars at Crepe Cellar and Growler's. He recently ordered take-out and his credit card was over-charged by almost 50% more than he signed. He has called and left his name/number for the manager three (3!) times over four days and has not gotten a call back, let alone a refund. Given this recent experience, we will likely take a break from your establishments. We would appreciate a call back."}
{"text":"I think this place and I are going to be friends.  There was a delicious salad of greens, dates, pine nuts and toasted manchego cheese which made an excellent entree with chicken added, and was satisfying without leaving me unpleasantly stuffed.  Of course, i went and spoiled that virtuous feeling by ordering a crepe Suzette for dessert, but it was to die for, so it's not like I regret it or anything."}
{"text":"This was our \"second chance\" visit to the Crepe Cellar. Our first visit was underwhelming but we had high hopes this time.

Our server, Allison, was second to none! The burrata was good... But not a good as last time. All 3 of our entrees were disappointing.

I ordered the beef short rib with gnocchi. The red wine reduction was tasty. The short rib tasted as if it had been reheated from a previous day. The gnocchi were so tough that I initially thought they had substituted pan fried potatoes. The kitchen remade them and they were only slightly more tender. 

My husband ordered the carbonara and it looked great. But... The pasta was overdone and the dish just seemed pasty and flavorless. It needed salt... Atleast. 

Our friend order a scallop dish and his words were.. \"Good concept but not tasty.\"

Overall the kitchen seems to lack balance.  If they would be more generous in the seasoning and find acidic balance there would have been a world of difference in our meal."}
{"text":"Had lunch here a little bit ago with my wife. We decided to eat here because we were under the impression they served gluten free crepes. After talking to the waitress, she made it clear that they make their GF crepes on the same pan as the regular crepes. So cross contamination is definitely a concern. 
 I ordered fish and chips which I thought was great. My wife order a steak which she felt was under cooked. So this review is sort of a push. Nothing spectacular or worth returning for."}
{"text":"This place is pretty bad.  Their food isn't great (not terrible but not worth an hour wait) and it seems poorly run.  I'm pretty sure our waitress forgot about our order...twice.  This place is not worth the wait or the price.  I had high hopes for Crepe Cellar too but unfortunately two chances is all they will get from me!"}
{"text":"Great place!! Great food!! Great service!! I highly recommend it!! Very accesible and it didn't take long to serve the food !!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience! Yolanda did an amazing job taking care of my girlfriend and I. The burrata appetizer was awesome. We also got the Spinach and mushroom Crêpe as well as the Ham and gruyere. I personally wasn't a fan of the Ham and gruyere, but Yolanda was more than willing to get get me the Crêpe I wanted. Was to full for desert, but will definitely be back! Would definitely recommend trying."}
{"text":"I do enjoy this place I always order the burger it's really good however I don't enjoy how long I have to wait for my food every time and I don't enjoy the soda selection at all"}
{"text":"Not even surprised that this restaurant has close to 200 reviews and all are positive ratings. This tiny euro pub is one of the most pleasant restaurants I've discovered in a while. The atmosphere is romantic and dimly lighted located in the NODA district. Perfect for date nights or ladies night. The servers are always nice and they make sure you have a great dining experience. They serve more than just crepes too. You should definitely order a desert crepe otherwise you'll miss out!"}
{"text":"Their brunch was nothing short of magical!  Our waitress Stacy was incredible, from positive energy to intelligent selections it made our meal memorable. The French toast was nirvana.  Make sure you try their homemade sausage, it was insane. And... Their coffee is brought to the table in a French press!!!!!  Perfection"}
{"text":"The food here was just okay. Their french press coffee is amazingggg. Now on to there crepes. The crepe seems to be a little bit soggy, and well just isn't much of a filling in there. You can taste more of the crepe, rather than their filling on the inside. I got the Queen City Crepe, and well it just leaves a little bit of a disappointment. My date ordered the french toast, and it just tasted very plain. It probably could've used alittle more batter. I also ordered the Brownie a Blanket Sundae. The brownie was a bit dry, the nutelle was yummy. You can never go wrong with the nutella. I do have to say it was definitely packed in there but I guess it's the local NODA residents that are faithful. But I do think, there can definitely be some improvement. For brunch, I would say Pewter Rose or Pike's Soda Shop really hits the spot."}
{"text":"They have great crepes, friendly service, and great beer."}
{"text":"Decor - Dining room is Great, but with kitchen a bit too open and seeing the jars of Sysco stuff is not a great visual
Food - Okay to Great  The oyster app was fantastic!  Props for those.  
                                        If your whole name is based on crepes, well those things better knock your socks off---they didn't.  Bland and nothing really of note that would make me say I want to come back again for those.   Since people will inevitably get those on their first whirl there, they stand to lose future return customers and referrals.  I'd advise to work on those and quick.  The burger was so freakin' good, though.  Very savory and I would come back for that.  
Price - Good."}
{"text":"Crepe Cellar is truly one of my favorites. In the NODA area of Charlotte. This place will satisfy your taste buds and the bar is full of amazing cocktails and beers. Tonight was just a stop for dessert and a drink. Our server was friendly and quick to take care of us. I had the 1st Ammendment Watermelon beer and it had a nice light cider taste to it but still refreshing. But the dessert crepe tonight was Brownie in a blanket. I needed help to finish this off. A fresh made crepe with walnuts and stuffed with a delicious moist brownie topped with ice cream. One of the servers even recognized us from our first visit last Halloween and asked would we be back this Halloween. How cool was that? And yes we will"}
{"text":"The pesto brie fries are to die for!  We have been here numerous times and each time the food has been perfect.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  We love the atmosphere and the wine choices.  It's a great place to snuggle up with your love and have a relaxing evening with delicious food and great wine!"}
{"text":"Loved our meal here! We started with the mussels and the famed brie pesto fries, and we probably could have just kept going on those and been so happy. They were delicious! For dinner we had a mushroom spinach crepe, the burger, a salad with shrimp and the sausage baguette pizza. All were fantastic and our table was filled with comments like \"Next time I am getting that!\" and \"I can't stop eating these fries!\". Our waitress was great and prices were fair. We would definitely recommend and return."}
{"text":"The illusory 'working lunch' brought us here today not for crepes, but for burgers, which our hostess promised were the best in Charlotte. While work was hard to complete, enjoyment of delicious gourmet burgers and nutella-stuffed dessert crepes was easy.

Pros
-Burger - I consider myself fairly experience in this department (especially recently, with 4 in the last week alone) but this was delicious. A little unorthodox with gruyere, fried onions and pickles it was daring and perfectly cooked. As an out of towner, I ordered medium-rare in a medium-only town, but still got what I wanted.
-Crepe dessert - nutella, banana, soft fluffy dough. Easy win.
-Our waitress heroically cut the check into 6 separates and processed 5 cards.

Cons
-Uneven service. Entrees were brought out in two waves which left that awkward 5 minutes or so for those early recipients, during which the other 3 of us had to make the obligatory command to 'please eat,' even though everyone knows it's rude to eat in front of hungry people.
-Cold fries on the first wave of entrees also earns them a few demerits."}
{"text":"This is such a cool place! We didn't intend to end up here but when the place we initially went to told us their wait time was 1.5 to 2 hours we just started walking down the street. We happened upon this place and were able to be seated immediately. It's not a large place, the lighting was dark and the place had a industrial vibe to it. Our server was Alex and she was great! We ordered appetizers only and OMG! SO GOOD! We shared an order of mussels and the portion was huge!!! More than enough to share. We also ordered the presto Brie French fries - DELISH!!! For our cocktails we both had the Smokin Word - this drink had a lot of tasty layers. Kind of spicy, a tiny bit of sweetness...hard to describe but very good. We received a complimentary serving of the Blasted Brussel Sprouts - also very good!! This is a nice place for a date or just to hang out with friends. I'm definitely returning."}
{"text":"Now that the place has been open for a while, they must have improved a lot bc these other reviews do no justice. The food is great. Love the roasted chicken and pumpkin gnocchi. The burger is better than Big Daddy's. Service is great and personal. Great date spot."}
{"text":"Cool hangout in the NO DA district. Nice pub and food is good. If you never been. A must try."}
{"text":"Have been here 5 times - the food is very good.  Last night was a disappointment.  My folks in from out of town, took a party of 6.  Out of house wine, so we ordered another bottle of white wine for $28, it was served warm at tasting.  Server, took and \"chilled\" the open bottle and returned it still warm - remedy was a cup of ice.  No scotch at bar except for Japanese Scotch - Scotch is from Scotland, right?  They were out of one of the entree's too.  Just disappointing and no effort to make things \"right\" by the server.  I will go back, but not for a while."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with NoDa; or better yet, a good restaurant in NoDa.  Crêpe Cellar is an awesome spot.  Their vegetarian crêpes are great as well as their cole slaw and truffle fries.  Not a big fan of their Brussels sprouts because they were a bit bitter when I've had them, but the drinks are great.  I've always found the staff great.  Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Great addition to NODA.  The menu is lovely...not just crepes!  I had the sweet potato gnocci which were pretty good.  (much more doughy than expected, and not hot enough, but good).  My favorite is the brie and pesto fries...Trashy and classy all together, I love it!  The service was friendly and quick, clientele hip and attractive, and the space was fun and well designed.  I am planning on many a late night of crepes and champagne...!"}
{"text":"Crepes are great but a bit pricey for what you get.  The cheese fries are fab if you are with a group.  If you have room try the desserts."}
{"text":"PESTO. BRIE. FRIES. Trust me on this one -- a must-try to start off a fantastic meal at this cute, cozy spot in NoDa. The fries are crispy and thin and the pesto, cheese, and tomato topping is so unique and ridiculously dangerous. Totally worth the couple of extra calories... ;)

This is a great spot for a date or with a small group of friends. The exposed brick walls, large bar, and smaller, low-lit eating space gives the Crepe Cellar a very intimate feel. 

I tried the ham and gruyere crepe with a side of asparagus. The crepe was delightfully crispy and light and packed full of flavor with the cheese and meat. My asparagus was also worth the slight up-charge, especially due to the sundried tomato topping that capped off the side. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"French coffee press is Amazing. If you like coffee, you won't be disappointed. 

I got the spinach mushroom crepe which was flavorful. The goat cheese in it was a bit salty for my taste so I would probably replace it next time or try something else. Fries were delicious and crispy. 

But the coffee, omg the coffee. I would come here again just for that. Service was great (wasn't busy weekday lunch time). Desserts looked great but was too full so will be returning to try other things! 

Cute decor/light fixtures!"}
{"text":"I went with some friends on a weekday. It wasn't crowded so we didn't have to wait. We were told that they do not do reservations. 

The staff is friendly and they do assist you if you need help deciding on what to order. 
We had the special, that was 3 creppes and our choice of salad or soup. 
The were good!!!
I will come back again and try something different. Everything looks delicious!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved my crepe for lunch (spinach and mushroom, goat cheese on the side) with a side salad.   My husband gave the burger two thumbs up as well.  They were playing Wilco and the Avetts (I'm always biased towards places that play music that I enjoy).  Our server was genuinely friendly and attentive. Great little place in funky NoDa!"}
{"text":"Normally we never go out to the NODA area and I never ever though we would eat here because when you hear a name like the Crepe Cellar all you think you are going to be eating are crepes. well weren't we wrong. Yes, of course they have crepes. But they also are known for many other things. For example their CRÊPE CELLAR BURGER (which I will be getting next time. 

When we walked in, it was a dark little restaurant that really reminded me of a pub feel. We were sat immediately and had the best server, Alex. She was so lively and excited that it was our first time in to eat. It really made the experience more exciting for us. She was very knowledgeable and seemed to really enjoy working there. 

So... For an appetizer, we ordered the mussels, which was very surprising to me because normally we never order mussels. Actually, now that I think about it, I have never seen my man eat mussels. But we ordered them and it was so worth the risk because they were AMAZING! The mussels were cooked with bacon, caramelized onions, shallots,
apples, and cider cream. To me, I was like no this can't be a good combination... but again I was wrong! It was a perfect combination of sweet, tart, light, creamy, deliciousness. If you are to go and get them ask them for extra bread to dip in once you finish. Great sharing dish.

For our entrees, my man had the BEEF SHORT RIB OVER POTATO HERB GNOCCHI, which included roasted tomatoes, shallots, cabernet reduction along with the gnocchi and beef short rib. The Short rib was so tender. I had their PASTA CARBONARA, which was fresh pasta, egg yolk, pancetta, grilled asparagus, parmesan, and black pepper. I ate it as is and it was actually a very light dish. You can add chicken or salmon for some extra protein. Entrees were portioned perfectly, but I suggest getting an appetizer or dessert if you are very hungry.

We were so full that we couldn't get a crepe for dessert, so we have to do that next time. It is definitely worth the trip out to Noda for this place."}
{"text":"In the running for the best burger in Charlotte despite only offering one burger option. Highly recommended if you're a burger aficionado.

Atmosphere is excellent with a dark bar vibe with French flair. Not very big but plenty of large comfy booths along the windows. Several tables as well.

Service has usually been good although can be a little slow when busy.

Consistency of food is usually quite good from visit to visit.

Parking sucks and is limited to the street. Expect a short walk at best unless you get lucky and nab a spot in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome service. Came with a friend and we tried a little bit of everything. Nothing was a disappointment. Sit at the bar with Alex, she's probably the sweetest bartender/server I've ever had"}
{"text":"This place makes me want to find other cellars in the area that specialize in something!  I've always wanted to try this place, but haven't gotten a chance to until this weekend.  The original plan was to hit up Cabo Fish Taco, but their wait was about an hour and it was starting to sprinkle a bit.  

The Crepe Cellar, also had a wait, but we were able to scrounge some space at the bar to booze it up before dinner.  We tried the Pesto Brie Fries (which were AWESOME) and I landed on the Spinach and Wild Mushroom Crepe.  The side I got was the purple slaw.... nothing to write home about, but unique and different.  I like how it was light and not doused with mayo like some slaws tend to be.  Was trying to save room for dessert, but I was stuffed.  I'll definitely have to come back to try a regular entree and dessert!

Overall our waiter was great and attentive (even for a busy night).  The atmosphere was very cool - I really liked how the specials were written on a mirror on the wall large enough to see from anywhere in the room.  I'm not a big fan of dark restaurants since I like to \"eat with my eyes\" first, but this was just to the point where dim was becoming too dark (a good balance!)."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!! I have eaten there 3 times and love it.  Can't wait to go back.  All the crepes are awesome.  The 4 Cheese is to die for. Oh and the Crepe Suzette is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Ok I am disappointed, tonight was not a very nice experience at Crepe Cellar. I've had better experiences. The waitress was indifferent, I asked her for recommendation but she acted like she was ready to leave. We didn't even go that late, it was 8:30PM. My Sangria was TERRIBLE, i want my $7 back! The Banana and nutella crepe was too sweet, this is the second time I had it and it is still not right. If you are going to call yourself crepe cellar, at least make your crepes takes good. If you want GREAT crepes, Try Hazelnut creperie, you won't be disappointed! The flavors are much more on par and the chefs are more committed. That being said, I do like the atmosphere at Crepe cellar, dark lighting, busy crowd and it is very loungey feel. I think they serve better salted food, like pesto fries and such. Just don't get anything sweet here, whenever I get sweets here, it ends up disappointing. My Crepe was OK, like acceptable, but my drink was TERRIBLE. Oh well, still a nice little place in Noda."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised with a great lunch special. Albeit a short lunch special menu, i grabbed the Queen City Crepe for $8 and $1 for a side and $1 for a drink. a $10 lunch isn't bad compared to paying around $15+ without the special. Besides prices, the food and presentation was great. The fries are awesome.....what else. OH! duh, like the name, when you walk in, it looks like you're inside of a cellar! Not a huge venue, but the size along with the bar makes the atmosphere seem....cozy in a way. I MUST come back to try dessert. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here before an Evening Muse concert on 6/21/2013.  Grabbed some counter space, had some ciders and a quick dinner, and it was pretty impressive!  The food is creative and outside the norm, which can make for an interesting meal.  I feel silly for not having tried this before!

Cabo Fish Taco is still a great choice, but consider giving the Crepe Cellar a try before your next concert in NoDa."}
{"text":"Great relaxed downtempo atmosphere.  Hip and classy while casual and unpretentious.  Impressive selection of beers, but nothing local.

\"Blasted brussels sprouts w/ arrugula pesto\" sounds great, but were too bitter, hard, and oily.

\"Pesto brie french fries\" were fabulous, but needs more pesto and Brie (and less oil) for a plate of fries that huge.  This is NOT a small side plate."}
{"text":"so this seems to be a popular place in charlotte, but i was a bit underwhelmed by my whole experience here.

first off, we were the only ones in the restaurant on a weekday night. no one else showed up for a half hour, and it seemed that the waitress had better things to do than check up on us in a more timely manner. she wasn't mean or rude, but she almost seemed uninterested in serving us by how she approached and left our table. maybe i was reading too much into it, but i found it odd. perhaps, she was just trying to give us our space and not \"smother\" us. i don't know. she really could have talked up the menu or been more into asking us what we needed/wanted.

my husband and i shared the house salad, the fish and chips and the infamous bananas foster crepe for dessert. house salad tasted good, but the dressing was overpoweringly garlicky. i could only eat half of it, because it was so strong. normally, i would have eaten it all myself--because, c'mon. it's just salad. the fish was actually perfect. nice crispy breading with a tender, moist fish in the middle. not too much batter, and no fish taste. just fresh and delicious. the tartar sauce was good, but not amazing. and the fries were a little too salty. they were cooked well. just too much sodium chloride.

and then--AND THEN--the bananas foster crepe. everyone here has raved about this crepe, so i decided we should try it. umm...maybe we went to the restaurant when everyone that worked there was having an off-day, but i thought it was totally boring. i was expecting something amazing, and i couldn't have been more sleepy about it. i've had better crepes at a friend's house, who had only learned to make crepes the same day we went over. it wasn't gross or anything. i guess there was just so much hype for me that i thought there would be more to it. 

sorry crepe cellar. while i'm glad i went to experience it, i don't know that i will go back. first impressions sort of mean a lot to me. and, i don't want to fall asleep at the table."}
{"text":"Such a cute atmosphere and great service! I was upset cause one of the drinks I wanted wasn't available but the super friendly bartender recommended another and it was delicious! They have a great liquor selection as well as beer and wine. My boyfriend and I just came here to get a dessert crepe, we got the mascarpone and berries crepe and it was delicious! I've been wanting to try this place for a while so it was very hard to chose which one as they all sounded amazing! I can't wait to come back for dinner and try one of their dinner crepes! If you aren't a crepe person they have plenty of other normal food on the menu as well!"}
{"text":"When in NoDa and you have a hankering for a dinner or dessert crêpe, you know where to go.

They host a variety of crepes and sandwiches on their menu. The facility reminds me of a dim light Belgian restaurant but right in Charlotte! 

If you're a fan of craft beer, bourbon, and whisky, you will enjoy the vast selection of options that they regularly offer on the menu.

The service at Crêpe Cellar has always been top. Friendly, helpful, and relatively fast. The one downside is the ventilation from the kitchen. You will come out of there with kitchen smell on your clothing."}
{"text":"Pretty big fan of this place - been there a few times and they have great fries, awesome crepes, and general yummy-ness. The desserts look awesome (though I'm always too full), and the staff is very friendly about making substitutions.  Only thing that is a bit bothersome is that it gets really-really loud in there if the restaurant is full and the bar is crowded --- feels like there are a lot more people in there than there really are, plus with music playing it's a bit overwhelming."}
{"text":"Grits...great. French Toast...fantastic. Customer Service...charming and memorable. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The most bare bones crepe that just comes dusted with some sugar, a little lemon, and a dollop of vanilla ice cream was DIVINE.  Eager to try more of their food."}
{"text":"I had a great lunch experience here! The waitress was on point, happy, and kind. 

We got the fries appetizer and it was extremely tasteful and delicious. I had the Queen Crepe for lunch, complimented with even more fries. The lunch was very tasty and I thoroughly enjoyed each bite, wishing it would never end. 

I left this Crepe place stuffed and happy. I recommend stopping in for a delicious brunch, lunch, dinner, post-dinner, whatever be your fancy! This place has a great Brooklyn/Noda vibe that fits the area very well."}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS. Went here last night for dessert after Cabo across the street. I agree with other people on here when they say they expect more dessert options. But, nonetheless, the banana fosters crepe never ceases to amaze me. 

Crepe Cellar has such an amazing ambiance. It's very calm and peaceful inside.. the candles on the table make it for a very romantic setting. The waitresses are always very friendly and helpful. 

I have yet to taste their dinner menu, but the options look incredible!

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is interested."}
{"text":"In August I purchased a living social coupon for Crepe Cellar that cost $20 for $40 worth of food. My first attempt to try it out happened to be on a Monday, and when we arrived, we saw that they weren't open. Sadly, we had to dine elsewhere. But last weekend a friend and I decided at the last minute to check it out, and I was not disappointed. A breakdown of dinner:

1. Soup of the day - poblano sweet potato - very good but quite spicy. We didn't actually order any of this, but they said we could try if we wanted, so we did.
2. Chili shrimp appetizer - very good - solid amount of shrimp and a large baguette to dip in the chili sauce.
3. Salads - my friend and I both got a salad and were pleased with our choices. She ordered the Charcuterie salad with chicken and I got the Endive & Apple salad with grilled shrimp. The ginger maple dressing on my salad was phenomenal.
4. We split the brownie in a blanket dessert, which is actually that - a huge brownie wrapped in a crepe with a scoop of ice cream and a humongous scoop of whip cream. Really good thing we decided to split dessert because it would have been impossible to each eat our own.

We arrived around 5:30pm on a Saturday, so got a parking spot on the street and didn't have to wait. But the place quickly filled up (there's not a ton of seating), so I'd try to make reservations or not show up at peak times if you don't want to wait. It's a bit dark in there, but very cool vibe overall. And the service was good, although food was a bit pricey. Yay for living social coupons!"}
{"text":"This is one of my little food fines in Charlotte love this place. I am sitting here now waiting for my burger. This Burger is so good and the staff is warm and inviting."}
{"text":"Located in the NoDa (North Davidson) district, this is a welcome addition to Charlotte's continuing culinary expansion.

I really enjoyed my lunch here, including both the savory and sweet crepes. The butter sugar crepe is simplicity at its best and the Nutella banana a serious chocolate-lover's indulgence. I would definitely like to come back here!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in NODA, pleasant and friendly service, the place is not big, there is probably about 8 small to medium size tables and there is a nice little bar where you can eat or enjoy a nice drink, they have specials and suggestions listed on a board at reasonable prices, I tried one of their red wine suggestions and fell I love with it.( I wish I could remember the name ;( but if I see the bottle I would recognize it right away) 
We waited about 45 min at the bar, which was about what the hostess had calculated, it was a Saturday night and we had no reservations, We could see the food brought around us looked and smelled delicious. 
Try the Brussels sprouts their steak and fries dinner was outstanding. 
Very pleasant experience all together, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch. Came in on a Sunday. Would definitely come back again. Loved the French press coffee! I had the eggs Benedict with smoked salmon and my other half had the French toast."}
{"text":"Loved the friendly service and the great food. Only problem I had was the music was too loud for understanding what the the waitress was saying and for talk at a normal volume. Would definitely recommend the chicken pesto baguette."}
{"text":"I have yet to eat something at the Crepe Cellar that I don't love. I love their breakfast crepes, lunch crepes and dessert crepes. YUM. 

In addition to the delicious food for which the restaurant is named, they also have a good selection of beer and wine and a full bar. 

The menu isn't extensive, but it's good. I highly recommend The Crepe Cellar for brunch, lunch or dinner. Good stuff.

Quick tip: **The Crepe Cellar has the best French Press I've ever had. Try it.**"}
{"text":"Let me tell you about Pesto Brie Fries- delectable ! I would go here in the future simply to scarf those suckers down because they are a real treat. Seriously go for just those alone!

We also shared the sweet chili shrimp appetizer. My original thought was ew- just a tad too sweet- but the more I ate the better they tasted. While, I probably wouldn't get these again they weren't exactly bad either. 

We each had a glass of prosecco and a second of a house white- and the bill was moderately priced at about $50 (including tip) 

We skipped on dessert but I am hoping to check those out next time!

The venue is Intimate and cozy- and the service is friendly. All around its a great place for a date or just to catch up with a friend..Id"}
{"text":"Great pesto Brie fries   Very very interesting menu.  Very ready to get to from ikea charlotte     What a find"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place o eat in NODA. You can't go wrong. The crepes are excellent. Their daily specials are on point. I have never experienced a bad meal here and the service is excellent. I highly recommend it. The Buckwheat Crepes Ham and Guyere with a nice side of Roasted cauliflower maybe a pesto fry appetizer paired with a hard cider makes for a very enjoyable meal. Top it off with a brownie in a blanket and you will go beyond satisfied."}
{"text":"Fabulous. Best lunch in a long time. Fried manchego with arugula salad and fig dressing."}
{"text":"We strolled past the Crepe Cellar during a gallery crawl and figured we would have to come back by.  During a crawl the place is packed.  Really packed.  As in you almost can't get through the door.

Come by on another night - say a random Thursday - and they are just about empty.  So that could seriously change your opinion of the experience.

The vibe of the Cellar is odd.  It's a darkened room that can't quite seem to decide if they want to be a funky dessert place, a bar or a sports bar (tvs on the walls).  I really don't have any idea, even after going in and staying for a bit.  We just had a dessert crepe.

Service was spotty, but decent.  It took a while to get the glasses refilled, but the never really got to empty, so I can't complain too much.  The crepe itself was tasty but probably didn't justify the price."}
{"text":"This is in my hood and I love it. Their menu is fresh and delicious. The atmosphere is really great for a date or a pleasant dinner out. The Brie and pesto fries are a must. Their French onion soup is solid and they actually use Gruyere.. So bonus points. 

I'm not going to lie, but sometimes I just go there for dessert. Crepe+brownie+Nutella+ice cream+candied walnuts+ whipped cream and a cherry on top."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to get back to CC. I came at lunch time with a friend and there was no wait at all around 12p. I had the baguette pizzas with pesto and chicken with a hard cider. Hit the spot. Meal and drink plus tax and tip was around $20."}
{"text":"Crepes do not taste like the crepes in France. They are not light and crispy like you find in Paris. They taste more like a burrito wrap- thick and gooey soft. Also one crepe that was ordered had a nasty mustard sauce on it. Yuck! Hubby loved his shrimp and grits that were $17 a plate for lunch! Fries were shoestring greasy fries like you get at the mall but served in a triangle serving cup."}
{"text":"This place was a home run. Great ambiance, not noisy at all and casual dining. The cocktail menu was detailed, descriptive and priced right. Even the restroom looked amazing. I'm a big fan of subway tiles and the restroom displayed them brilliantly. 

As soon as you walk in the restaurant, you're greeted by the hostess while passing the full service bar with top shelf liquor and a cooled featured wine fridge. Most of their menu is chalked on the board along side the seating area with their specials also chalked. 

Service is quick and on point. Our waitress Sara took our orders and quickly got us our cocktails, and appetizers. The drinks were great. A mix of all types of top shelf liquor spruced up with a sour, sweets and bitters. Our appetizer was steamed mussel with smokey bacon, jalapeños in a beer broth with fresh bread to soak up the flavors of the broth. 

Our entrées were nothing short of spectacular. Seared tuna on a bed of steamed kale with roasted garlic quinoa and a grilled tomato cream sauce. The fish and chips was a large portion of beer battered cod and hand cut fries served with ketchup, tarter and malt vinegar on the side. 

For dessert we had a Bananas Foster which is a warm crÊpe with bananas and whip cream. 

This place was perfect for us. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"4th time at Crepe Cellars.  First 3 times were fabulous (would rate a five if it wasn't for most recent experience), couldn't wait to go back, 4th time, a little disappointed in some of the food and hostess was very rude.  When I put my name on the list I asked for an approximate wait time.  The hostess seemed very insulted that I asked, she said \"I CANNOT predict how long the wait will be...there are three parties ahead of you.\"  We waited about one hour.  Sat at bar while we waited- the bartender is FABULOUS, he is very attentive and knows ALL about the wine selection (as a bartender should).  Our waitress was very attentive.  The Queen City crepes were very dry but had great flavor, the last time I had them they were MUCH better.  The ham and gruyere crepes were drenched in the béchamel sauce which made them seem almost like a breakfast or brunch item, too much sauce, too sweet, but also VERY good flavor.  The  succotash is AMAZING!  And the crepe suzette is to die for!!!  I was also a little disappointed that there was a table with about 6 screaming children next to us, not the fault of the restaurant...Very reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch.  Charming spot on the north side of Charlotte.  I went due to the Yelp reviews and wondered where the hell i was going during the drive up there thru strip mall hell and suburbia.  However, NoDa is this tiny little 2x2 blocks of stores and restaurants...almost what we hoped dilworth would be.

The food was awesome.  French press coffee.  Smoked salmon and egg crepes, pesto/brie french fries.  My heart is still aching but my stomach was lovin' me."}
{"text":"Stopping through Charlotte for the night on our way back to VA, my wife and I explore the NoDa neighborhood.  I had the Stone Brewing Oatmeal Chocolate stout, which is delicious.  We ordered one of the baguette pizza's, which was good but not earth shattering.  Enjoyed the ambiance, lighting, and setting.  Service was really quick and attentive."}
{"text":"Stopped in here late evening after a Noda hang on Saturday night.  Mac n cheese was really good.  
Good atmosphere, good service despite the later hour"}
{"text":"You had me at buckwheat! 

I am a nut for buckwheat, and really anything that goes above and beyond flour. Flour is blah. Buckwheat is so nutritious and full of minerals and fiber, and let's not forget it's totally delicious! My friend ranted a raved a little about this place, setting it up with quite the lofty praise that \"everything there is good\". My jaded and suspicious heart (which has yet to get over the disappointment of the Blair Witch Project hype) immediately began looking for ways to prove her wrong. ...... Then I saw \"buckwheat\" on the menu. In fact all of the crepes are made with buckwheat. ..Squee!

I hemmed and hawed and landed on the turkey, apple, brie crepe and the slaw. I don't normally like slaw, but something (fate!?) led me to order it. And I beheld it. And I tasted it. And it was glorious. All of it. The crepe was delicious and just the right serving size. The slaw was a red (purple?) cabbage with just the right liquid mixture. i could eat that slaw every day. 

My companion had one of the sandwiches, but requested it on a crepe. They'll do that, because they're awesome. She also ordered the pesto fries. As far as I could tell, her meal was thoroughly enjoyed. The pesto fries had a great taste and are definitely a dish to share. They are, however, slightly too salty and soggy for me to say I love them. I can only recommend them and hope that the s&s concern is shared by others and will be fixed in the future.

Mixed drinks were good. Food was good. Buckwheat was delicious. Truly \"everything there is good\". I do have to warn you that the place is really loud. The sound carries very strangely in some of the old warehouse-ish buildings. I could hear the guy diagonal from me and 5 feet away better than I could hear my friend across from me. Expect a lot of shouting and for your conversation to be overheard by your neighbors."}
{"text":"Beyond the overly delicious bananas foster crepe, one of my favorite desserts in Charlotte, I've been super impressed with a few more items I've snacked on as of late...

Pesto Basil Fries: 3.5/5: I mean, comon', now. A pile of hot crispy frites smothered in melty brie, pesto and diced tomatoes. It's exactly what you think it would be. The 

Fig Salad 5/5: Holy cow, I'm crushing on this salad. Fresh, peppery arugula sprinkled with sweet figs, pine nuts, a light fig balsamic dressing and (my choice) of grilled shrimp. Oh, and don't you forget the fried manchego cubes on the side. NOM. 

I dig the environment, the cozy tables and the friendly service that encompasses the Crepe Cellar. Long live the crepe!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for crepes. Not a big menu. Mostly savory or sweet crepes. Very casual and affordable  small and cute. On street parking"}
{"text":"Great food. Had brunch with a friend. Bloody mary was delicious.  I ordered the KB French toast and we share the pesto fries for an appetizer. Both were amazing. We should have shared a meal. Large portions."}
{"text":"Their sweet and savory crepe options were wonderful! My boyfriend and I split one of each and were very impressed."}
{"text":"The highs are really high and the lows are really disappointing at Crepe Cellar.  I haven't taken advantage of their range of beer and wine; this is probably bad, because judging by the urgency of the kitchen they're really hoping you'll take 20-30 minutes to drink something and not worry about how long your dishes will take to get to your table.

Pros: Very friendly waitstaff - every time I've been, each server was engaging and friendly. Specials creative enough to want to order.  The crepes themselves are excellent (as well as a good value), and the savory buckwheat crepes are surprisingly light.  The purple coleslaw, on its better days.  The desserts are great.

Cons: The kitchen is slow and underseasons each entree that I've had so far, including the beef stew, the crepe with spinach, goat cheese, shallots and chicken and a different crepe special.  This food can get bland.  

When to go: For an early dinner before the crowds start to arrive, or with a date in the evening to split a dessert.

I want to love this place, but it can't happen until the kitchen is as disciplined with the rest of its savory offerings as it is with the crepes."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, not so crazy about the crepes (minus the dessert one with gnutella).  Hopping spot on the weekends, make sure you are not going on a gallery crawl night or be prepared for a 2+ hour wait.  Sadly no reservations.  Good beer list and service."}
{"text":"Crepe Cellar....First Review is now retracted ....  had a bit of bad luck my first visit and wrote a \"not so nice\" review.   Went back again and had a totally different experience.

Everything was perfect from the moment we walked in the door.  Granted it was busy on a late Tuesday night...but we managed to get right in and on a table somehow.   

Bartender did an excellent job on our cocktails.

Food was delicious and came out with perfect timing.

The salad was nice and fresh and not drowning in dressing.  The Fusilli pasta was an excellent choice.  It had lots of flavor without being heavy or overpowering.

The dessert (Chocolate Brownie Crepe) was probably THE best thing that hit the table.

Our server was a cutie and very nice.

Overall,  we had a great experience and now this may be one of my favorite new little spots to eat.

Glad I tried it again.....Check it out...you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"My sister and I stumbled upon the crepe cellar on our mini food tour.  We shared a banana and nutella crepe, which was the most amazing and simple dish!  The bananas were the perfect consistency and the nutella was the perfect temperature.  The waitress was a bit slow, but she was very pleasant.  

Free street parking."}
{"text":"This is a super cute restaurant located in the NoDa area, specializing in delicious crepes of all varieties. The location is perfect since it is central to a lot of bars, cafes, ect. The atmosphere is perfect for a date night since it has a really romantic vibe. 

The crepes themselves are amazing! When I when here I had a dessert crepe with nutella in it! The crepe itself was warm and the nutella was oozing out of it. The entire thing was topped with whipped cream adding the finishing touch. If you are looking for something  more on the savory side they have different options to include ham, wild mushroom and spinach, plus more. 

If you are in the NoDa area I would give this place a try."}
{"text":"The crepe that I had was not seasoned very well( I had the goat cheese and chicken crepe) and they added only a bit of goat cheese. The food is not worth it to me for the price. The fries were amazing and the atmosphere was pretty good too."}
{"text":"First of all, order the pesto brie fries as an appetizer - they're a must! This may sound strange, but we go to the crepe cellar specifically for their burger. It is seriously one of the best burgers in Charlotte - rivaling those on the menus of specialty burger joints. The flavor of the beef paired with the gruyere cheese, onion straws, and garlic aioli is out of this world. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I ordered the mac and cheese as a side and it was outstanding. On top of this, the cocktails are great & service is wonderful. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My friend's cousin took us to this place as she'd heard a lot about it. I never say no to crepes, so in we went. It was an interesting vibe, good concept, not too full in the late afternoon.
Friend and I thought we could take advantage of happy hour deals but we were promptly told by the waitress that there is NO happy hour in all of North Carolina. What a travesty! We almost didn't believe her and then learned, you Charlotte-ians have worked your way around that problem. You just call them \"specials\" and offer them all day long (and I'm not sure how exactly this all day special is supposed to prevent binge drinking...) Whatever, as long as I get my $1 off that beer. 

Onto the food - I only sampled the crepes the other two gals had. One was a sausage and peppers with shallots, and the sausage was delicious, but there wasn't enough stuffing, and I wasn't a fan of the buckwheat crepe, it just doesn't taste good on its own. With more stuffing and flavor, this crepe would have been delish. The other crepe was the wild mushroom and spinach with caramelized shallots and goat cheese, so I was expecting a lot of great flavors. But it too fell short, it needed more salt and seasoning, and more stuffing. 
The slaw was decent, I prefer this vinegar slaw to the regular slaw.

The beer was good, wish they had \"specials\" on the wine, and the service was ok, a little over-attentive, and then a little over-apologetic when we noted our \"special\" on the beer wasn't accounted for."}
{"text":"Pesto Brie fries are a must if you want an appetizer!  Both crepes we had were also amazing! 
Cute spot in NODA and great for a date night. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here just the other day, it was great.  We had some steamed coffee (the kind with a timer) and crepe's! Was a fun place and not too expensive either. :)  Will definitely return in time."}
{"text":"Nice ambience, very friendly, polite and professional waitresses. The menu is limited, but you would go there for Crepes and they do a good job on that. They have limited space but its worth waiting in the neighbouring bar (the waitress comes and fetches you once a table is available!).  Overal I was really happy and will go again."}
{"text":"First, get the Pesto Brie Fries. They are unbelievably good. Out of this world good. I've come back just for them. 

The savory crepes are okay here. I have no complaints I just think I may not be a savory crepe kind of guy. I really enjoy the atmosphere of this place, it's kind of cozy and warm. Plus, the staff has always been nice here."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! It's very small and cozy, but not at all overcrowded. The lighting is low and the atmosphere is laid-back so it's a great place to go with a group of friends or on a date. 

The food is delicious, I love the unique foods they use to fill the dinner crepes. I tend to order the turkey, apple and Brie which never disappoints. The dessert crepes are also fantastic, sweet and tummy but not so rich that you're left with a toothache after :-)

The service is always friendly and the food gets out to you rather quickly. I've only gone right after work, around 5:30pm, so I usually beat the real dinner rush around 6:30/7:00."}
{"text":"This place AMAZING! Such a cozy atmosphere, great food, and the cocktails here are to die for!"}
{"text":"We finally ventured to Crepe Cellar after having passed by it numerous times.  While we didn't really like their signature dish (i.e., their crepes), we liked the other dishes enough to want to return and try something different. 

We started with the burrata, a delicious dish of homemade (?) mozzarella, grilled French bread, and a drizzle of honey and lemon.  If you have had the burrata at Dolce, we really think this one is better.  And, it's much less expensive!

For our entrees, I had the four cheese (with bacon) crepe, and my husband had the crepe special, with ham, Swiss, mushrooms, and tomatoes.  His was better than mine, but honestly, neither of us were fond of the grainy buckwheat crepes.  My mac and cheese side, however, was just fantastic.  

Service was really good and attentive on a busy Saturday evening.  And we both really liked the vibe of the place.  

We will come back, and we'll probably try either a burger or one of their entrees on our next visit.  But we'll most definitely get the burrata again."}
{"text":"I've now been here a couple of times.  They just expanded - so there is more room and less of a wait too!  I always love my meal, and often try the specials, but definitely have my favorites.  The brussel sprouts are out of this world.  I try all the time to mildly duplicate this recipe and just can't.  They are insane.  The burgers are great and I always try to split a couple of things so there is room for dessert.  You cannot come here without at least splitting a dessert crepe.  The people that work there are super sweet and try to accommodate however they can for special occasions and big groups.  Its especially awesome for dates or anniversaries and such - and there is a bar right next door (owned by the same people) that you can go afterwards too."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite places to eat! I've been here 3 or 4 times with friends, and all of us have hugely enjoyed our meals. The dessert crepes are to die for, and the beers are excellent. The tea was one of my favorite parts, and I was very happy with the selections. I took one friend there just because he would enjoy the tea, and we were not disappointed!
Even if I eat elsewhere in NoDa, I find myself at the Crepe Cellar for dessert and tea..."}
{"text":"No didn't love it won't be back.  Pesto fries great idea with cheese so in actuality small handful of cheese melted on fries then large amount of pesto on top. Couldn't taste anything but pesto and fries cheese could not come through all that. Onion soup sweet really sweet lots onions bland bland base not rich enough or deep enough. Crepe turkey apple compote shaved deli turkey really filling small amount crepe still doughy.  Mac and cheese now that was awesome some little zing at the end amazing. A bit to cheesy for me but worth it. Fish and chips which is supposed to be Charlottes best was good not great. It gets a lot of it's oomph from its presentation the smaller side of the fish was good when you got to the thicker part was a little too bland or really bland and slightly mushy with a heavier fish fat content. I should say about the fish it's about 3.5 inches thick at one side tapers down to about two inches  tube shaped and maybe 5-6 inches long. It looks really cool and the way the batter comes off sorta makes it look like a fish. 3.50 for a piece of cold bread not cool. It was supposed to be warmed baguette. Drink menu great and wine menu nice. Service was good and she was pleasant kept up with water sodas and such.  It's like it's close got good enough but didn't go further. What about a bechamel sauce on side for fries to tamper pesto and give it better flavor. Better base for onion soup."}
{"text":"Our server was very nice, but not at all attentive. Myself and my lunch companion both ordered beer and waited for nearly 10 minutes while we watched her stock the bar rather than pouring our drinks. 

The food was good, but I feel like it was overpriced for the quality."}
{"text":"This is a cute little restaurant, very cozy and intimate inside.  The food is so good!  They have different specials all of the time and most are definitely worth trying.  The dessert crepes are to die for! 

The service is excellent. The staff has always been very welcoming and friendly every time that I've been there.  They are knowledgeable of the food and drinks and will offer up ideal selections!"}
{"text":"I used to study abroad in Japan and the only kind of crepes I came across there was the dessert type, sweet street vendors selling icecream and strawberry filled snacks. But dont be expecting this place to only satisfy your dessert cravings, they are a bunch of show offs that declares to the world crepes can be real food too.

Crepes for breakfast, crepes for brunch, lunch, dinner and dessert they do get creative. I myself ordered their burger because crepes are forever a dessert food for me, but my so ordered one of the crepes as a brunch dish and it wasnt too bad. Itll take me a few trips to convert me tho.

The place was overall very clean and hip, maybe even too hip. Hipster central, guess thats why they charge like 10 dolars a crepe. But it was still good. Service was good, tho they never wrote down our orders and forgot a sausage on the so's crepe, which they corrected later. Should probably write down a customer's order on the spot, hipsters are smart but like 90% hot air.

Overall a very interesting experience that will change your preconceptions of crepes forever. Either you'll come to love crepes even more, or outright hate em from now on. Hopefully it's the former. For me Im not sure. Good luck my friends."}
{"text":"This is a great place in the Noda area. With Crepes being part of the name, I bet you can guess what might be featured on the menu! Yes, that's right.... Crepes. And they are good crepes too! Overall, I like this restaurant for its food, atmosphere, and wine selection. They do have much more than crepes to eat so do not worry if you are not a fan of the crepe. The menu is fairly extensive including burgers, salads, etc. One thing that I especially like is that they seem to try to draw from local sources for menu items - which I prefer. Although I met friends for dinner when I went, I could easily see this as a good date restaurant."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in NoDa! My husband and I frequent the Crepe Cellar a lot and always bring visitors from out of town here. We live the mussels, chicken sandwich and Brussels sprouts. Our friends have loved the Crepes although they our not our favorite on the menu. This place is always on point!"}
{"text":"I went here for brunch after church w the BF. Really cute inside with a great atmostphere. The menu is very diverse, with all sorts of brunch items from standard egg/meat/carb plates, to crepes sweet and savory, and things like french toast and a really tasty looking burger. The sage honey butter biscuits were delicious!! I just wish the butter came on the side instead of pre-smeared on top.  I wanted more of it, and I wanted it on more than just the top layer of the biscuit! It was delicious though.  I had the sausage egg and cheese crepe.  It was ok, but didn't knock my socks off. It needed a little salsa or something to jazz it up, and I didn't like the gluten friendly crepe wrapper. The grits were really really good as a side dish though.  BF had the french toast which was amazing and the omelet of the day.  The omelet was made incorrectly initially and our server apologized and fixed it before even bringing it out, and comped it at the end of the meal because of the delay. I ogled the burgers at the table next to us, they looked amazing. There were many fancy beverage options, but we didn't imbibe. For a Sunday brunch the restaurant had good traffic and stayed busy but we were seated immediately. Not the best brunch I've ever had, but definitely solid and recommended."}
{"text":"The oysters and the burger were absolutely incredible. I wasn't a big fan of the sausage and egg crepe but then again it may be because I enjoyed the burger so much."}
{"text":"This is my second time going to Crepe Cellar and it didn't disappoint this time either. I had the French Toast breakfast with potatoes and bacon. Really good. Had to take the last two pieces home add the bread is so thick. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's been years since I have been here. Crepes usually don't fill me up but the Apple, brie crepe was substantial and delious. Noce to know that this NODA staple is still rocking it for so long. If you haven't been, do yourself a favor and go."}
{"text":"First time here and I can't wait to come back. We came for sunday brunch. I ordered the ham and gruyere crepe which was AMAZING (and I lived in France for 6months). It came with a side of home fries (not really french but seasoned very well). You have to order the honey biscuit as a side. It's made with sage and honey and drizzled with honey and butter. Delicious!! We split one for desert (yup, it's that big) and had it with coffee. Note - if you order a cup of coffee you will get an entire French press (I.e., 3-4 glasses of coffee). 

Although they were very busy (Sunday brunch is the busiest) we were seated quickly and had great service!!"}
{"text":"Been here for lunch a few times during the week. It was not busy during this time.  Had savory and sweet crepes and all of them were delicious. I especially love the french press coffee they serve.  It's from a local place and ground fresh."}
{"text":"I visited this location last night with a friend.  My reviews of the Crêpe Cellar certainly did not do it justice.  We decided to try several different small dishes (tapas style) and I'm so glad we did.  It was fabulous, fabulous, fabulous!  First, we ordered the pesto Brie fries and oysters.  The pesto Brie fries were just as amazing as the first time I had them.  I think the only thing I would mention about those is that there was a lot of oil from the pesto.  However, the fries were still good enough to lick the plate if needed.  The oysters were absolutely the best oysters my friend and I (combined) had ever tasted.  The oysters were cooked to perfection and just the right balance of flavors.  Then, we chose the Queen City crepe with a side of mac & cheese.  The chef took the time to split it into two plates for us to share.  Those little attention to details really make the experience more memorable.  Lastly, we had white bean bisque, which was very exquisite.  The flavors balanced well and just really tasted great.

If you come to Charlotte or NODA, I would suggest stopping by to have dinner.  The food and wait staff were amazing.  If you go anywhere else for dinner, you're missing out!

I would say our experience was pretty epic and we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The Crepe Cellar was amazing! The food, the drinks, the staff...everything was wonderful. Brunch for Mother's Day, as you can imagine, was very busy. Alex, our server (who was also managing the bar) never missed a beat. The pesto brie fries were great...full of flavor and nice texture. The smoked salmon breakfast crepe was delicious. And the limoncello craft cocktail was killer. You can taste the passion the chef has for his/her art. My friends and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is a new favorite lunch spot of mine in NoDa. Came here with a girlfriend of mine and got the Mushroom& Spinach Crêpe, added chicken, and subbed the fries with a house salad. Great flavor and light yet filling lunch. Took away one star because it wasn't very warm when served. The server reheated it and didn't charge me for adding chicken on the bill, which was nice."}
{"text":"I have tried the Pesto Brie Fries and they certainly are \"devour able\" num. Mint-green tea is a staple for me, along with the strawberry banana Nutella crepe.  The Pesto pasta is meh, I ordered the thing once and never again, also had the pizza there not my favorite. Thank goodness the desserts, service, and atmosphere makes everything Good!"}
{"text":"One of the first places I dined at in Charlotte. I loved it. Everything from the service, to the food. and the ambiance was great. I recall having the special of the day, which was Salmon, and I remember quite liking it :)
Even though it was a week night, the restaurant was busy (and I've noticed that, that seems to be the case with most good restaurants in the city! Whether weekday or weekend, if the weather i good, people are out and about!). Crepe Cellar is one of those quieter, dimly lit places, that allows you to sit and have a good conversation over some tasty food and good wine."}
{"text":"I've been to Crepe Cellar a handful of times. It isn't one of my go-to places mostly because it is very small, often crowded, and loud inside. Everything I've had here has been pretty good, but I'm not a huge fan of crepes so I normally go for something else. Their pesto brie fries are awesome and the brussels sprouts are the best I've had anywhere. The sprouts are roasted and then topped with arugula pesto and parmesan--yum yum! My husband and I split the fries and sprouts as our meal and still had leftovers. 
They usually have specials that sound delicious. Prices are all over the map so you can go and spent $10 or you can spend $25 on a special entree. They have a small but decent beer selection and a good wine selection."}
{"text":"Overall, great food and great atmosphere!  The minute I drove by and saw the word crepe, I had been dying to go, so I finally dragged my boyfriend.  I wasn't expecting him to enjoy it since he's more of a \"meat and potatoes\" kind of guy.  He ended up fending well for himself with their tuna seafood special which was to die for.  I on the other hand, stuck with the crepes.  The ham and gruyere crepe was everything I expected and hit the spot.   Just understand that you are getting exactly what you ordered, ham and cheese so don't set your expectations too high. 

 For being a busy night, we got our food remarkably fast.  The desserts are where it is at when you come here.  We both got the nutella crepes and they were by far our favorite part.  The fruit was fresh and ripe and was a perfect end to a good meal.  

My only warning, this place is very small, only 12 or so tables and a small bar, so be aware that if you go during peak hours, you are going to have a pretty good wait."}
{"text":"This was and I stress \"was\" one of my favorite places to eat.  Because we had tickets to an event, my friend attempted to make reservations and was told that reservations were not accepted, but if we arrived by 6:00, there should be no problem with seating.  Were we ever wrong!  The place was packed, and I guess I should be glad for the restaurant.  We thought about going some place less crowded, but we were told we would be seated in 15 minutes.  Now.  I don't care if you are the owner, busboy, hostess.....whatever.  Don't say \"15 minutes\" if you can't deliver.  We waited close to an hour before we had a table.  I ordered the spinach and mushroom crepe.  I have enjoyed this entree in the past.....creamy, delicious and vegetarian.  As I was eating, I bit down into something absolutely repulsive and discovered it was chicken.  Because we were pressed for time, I simply removed the poultry from the dish.  What was left was a smidge of spinach and very few mushrooms, no cheese or sauce to speak of.  Thank goodness for the smattering of fries, or I would have left hungry.  I am typically laid back, but this experience was definitely a gastronomic horror film."}
{"text":"The food was decent. I loved the pesto brie fries! It is a must get appetizer, you will regret it if you don't order this! 

The first time I went there, I got the special crepe with salmon. It was delicious. However, the second time, I ordered the pesto pasta and it was surprisingly disappointing. There was not enough flavor, very bland. I'm not sure if it was an off day or what, but I was sad considering the awesome experience I had the first time. 

My friend ordered the beef short rib over potato herb gnocci and that was really good! So I would recommend trying that. The beef was so tender and the gnocci was perfectly cooked with such a great sauce! 

The atmosphere is good too. It's quite small, but can be very intimate and private. Not a bad place to go on a date!"}
{"text":"Had brunch with our 3 kids on Sunday. First time and were very impressed. All 5 entrées were tasty and original. Fresh ingredients and excellent service. Fries were fantastic along with the desert crepe we shared as our final dish. Looking forward to doing a dinner with wife for a fun night out.  No complaints so highly recommend! Pics of our dishes attached."}
{"text":"i do like the appetizers there. Hubby had a crepe (savory) and I didn't care for it. I will speak for my food: I ordered shrimp and grits which is amazing and shrimps were juicy and delicious. Also, we had desserts crepe and asked for a scoop of ice cream on the side. I had a good meal there. Be aware that the charge on your credit card will be from the  Growlers pourhouse ( i had to google ) since we did not eat there (apparently same owners?). Would go back."}
{"text":"Last night I finally made it to the place, the beer I ordered(only IPA in the place) They ran out of . The service was skimpy, the server never read us the specials. What we did get was ok, spinach and mushroom crepes plus chicken and a club. The mushrooms tasted canned and it was not very hot. There are wines by the glass or bottle, same for beer and full bar service."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly good so that may be why I am giving it 4 stars.  I think my expectations were pretty low so I came out on top in this case!  It was one of the only places not taking reservations for NYE so we ended up eating here with a group of 6.

They had a seared tuna over sweet potatoes special that night and a sausage and peppers crepe.  Everyone in our party was very satisfied with their meals.  At our table we ordered a couple of the tuna meals, the sausage and peppers crepe, the queen city crepe, the pasta dish and I ordered the endive and apple salad....I know, seems to be a little boring but this was one of the best I have ever had.  I think it was their ginger maple dressing..a must try!!!  

Everything had a lot of flavor and seemed pretty fresh.  Those who had fries on the side were especially happy because they were seasoned curly fries.  Very scrumptious!

Then came the dessert....I was hoping that we could all try something different but the waitress steared us all to the brownie in a blanket.  It was exactly what it sounds like...a big warm brownie wrapped up in a crepe, topped with vanilla bean ice cream, whipped cream and candied walnuts.  It was a very rich brownie and it was also covered with nutella so it was super filling.  We really could have ordered one with 6 people and we would have been fine.  The vanilla bean ice cream was a little...well...bland.  It had  potential to really join forces with the brownie and make a perfect bite, but for some reason it just didn't flow that well in my opinion.  It didn't add anything to the overall flavor as I was hoping it would.  And, quite honestly, the crepe didn't add much to the whole package either.  It was just not quite working for me.  I think you have to be still semi-hungry and an absolute chocolate lover to enjoy this dessert.  It was good but it could have been a little better in my opinion!  I am dying to try the bananas foster crepe.  I will definitely return.

The negatives:  Not very many vegetarian or vegan options.
The scene:  Great for groups, not a romantic setting even thought it is dim in the restaurant.
Location:  It is centrally located in the fun noda area so it is a great place to grab a quick, affordable fun dinner AND dessert before heading to your next spot!

Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give Crepe Cellar more stars, but every experience I've had here rounds out to really just OK. Some nights it's really spotty service and a delicious meal, others it's spectacular service and a lackluster meal. Last night was pretty much the same story. 

We ordered the cellar plate (meats & cheeses) and it was dropped off without any description. We figured most of it out on our own, but the whole time we were enjoying it I couldn't get the server's attention to give us a rundown. We didn't get checked in on until our entrees were brought to the table, and when we finally go to ask about a certain cheese, we couldn't even be given a straight answer. How do you not know what the chefs are plating up? 

Our entrees were fairly good. The flavors of the duck dish were great even though parts of the protein were a little tough (the middle was seared beautifully). The Queen City Crepe was delicious, and with a side a fries very filling (though yes, a good portion of them were as mike k described \"crumb fries\").  

Will I find myself eating at crepe cellar again? Most likely. They offer a menu selection somewhat rare for NoDa, and you can't pass up their great beer options. (Plus, I have a feeling CC has the potential for a five star evening it in somewhere...) Also, on busier nights I love that I can put my name in and then mosey on over to growlers for a drink or two until my table is ready."}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday night, and there was a fair number of tables occupied.  The brussel sprout appetizer was excellent.  I had the steak and fries, which was cooked just right.  

The nutella and banana crepe was good, but it was a little cold.  It was a good experience none the less."}
{"text":"Hmmmm...we had such high hopes!  

We went there for a Saturday lunch today.  When we walked in the place was full, but we only had to wait about 2 minutes for a table to open up.  Nearly perfect timing!  It was a beautiful day, so NoDA was packed with pedestrians, and we considered ourselves fortunate to grab a table so quickly.

A few minutes later our waitress took our drink and appetizer orders.  They have very little available for children to drink - no juices other than what they use at the bar, and no milk.  For kids who don't like soda or plain water, there's not much choice.  My son ended up drinking nothing for the entire meal because he hates soda and they didn't have milk or juices available.

For the apps we ordered the mussels and the brussel sprouts.  The mussels were delicious and I could have eaten those all day long.  I found the brussel sprouts to be VERY bitter and could only eat 3-4 before the overwhelming bitterness became too much.

About five minutes after our appetizers arrived, the kids' food arrived at the table.  We finished our apps soon after that and then waited....and waited...and waited.  Our kids were halfway done with their food before our waitress came over to refill a glass and I asked where the food for the two adults was.  She said it was coming out next.

So we waited...and waited.  For about 30 more minutes.  By then our kids were long since done with their food, and getting bored just sitting there (thank heavens for phones with games galore!).  Methinks the waitress forgot to put in the complete order - that's the only thing I can think that would have caused such a major delay.  But we kept our smiles through the whole thing, continuing to keep the kids occupied while we waited.

FINALLY she brought out our food, and apologized for the long wait.  It's not like we ordered complicated food.  My husband got one of their standard crepes and I got a burger (having originally planned to have a dessert crepe).   There was NO REASON that burger and those crepes should have taken nearly 45 minutes to come out to the table (which was the time from when the appetizers were cleared away to when the food finally arrived).  Other tables around us were being served - including tables that arrived AFTER us.

Anyway, despite the wait, the food was good.  My husband enjoyed his crepe (spinach and mushrooms) and my burger was perfectly cooked and with amazing flavor.  

As we were finishing, our waitress came over and apologized for the long delay and said she would reduce our bill as an apology.  She also asked if we wanted a dessert crepe, but in the end we decided against it.  We didn't feel like waiting anymore and wanted to get back out into the sunshine to enjoy the rest of our day.

Will we go back?  Probably not.  While the food was good, it wasn't a meal that made us say, \"WOW - WE HAVE TO GO BACK!\"  Add in the slow service (the restaurant was always full, but surely they should be used to that given how few tables they have?) and it's not a place to which we'd return."}
{"text":"As a native New Orleanian and lover of crepes this place had my name written all over it. It was my friends birthday and we just ate dinner across the street and wanted a change of scenery. 

We walked up to the door to check it out. The hostesses(2) ignored us completely and yelled at the other couple that walked passed them to enter the restaurant. They really didn't understand their job description but I was already in love with this place so we didn't let that bother us and found the last 2 seats at the bar. Perfect! 

The bartender was awesome. Personable,knowlegable,everything you would want in a bartender. Ambiance is romantic,classy but loud. (Very small dining area with nothing to soak up the acoustics=loud. ) 

Not sure if the a/c was working but it felt about 80 degrees in there. 

We ordered the bananas fosters crepe with ice cream and 2 drinks. 
The sauce,fresh whipped cream,bananas,ice cream were all amazing except the crepe! The crepe was too thick,tasteless and chewy. Such a shame since the NAME of the place is CREPE cellar! Not sure if its the recipe or the cook but they gotta fix that. Overall we had a very nice experience."}
{"text":"2nd visit, stopped by after tasting beer next door for a quick bite with friends.  The place is tiny... so we sat at the bar instead.  I am not per se complaining, but as the 3rd wheel of the night, the bartender made it worse to totally skipping me as if I didn't even exist.  Oh well... I'll survive.  

I ordered a simple soup of the day (mushroom & leek) and it was oh so tasty.  I ended up eating my friends' pesto brie fries and I can see why it's a feature item.  It was like a combustion of so many flavors.  I also got a slice of their pizza/flatbread.  I didn't expect it to come on such a thick looking piece of bread, but it was moist yet crunchy on the outside.  All in all the food was 2-thumbs up... only thing is there's some serious garlic in all the items we ate, thank goodness I was the 3rd wheel and kissing wasn't on my agenda.

I can't wait to come back for the crepes... from what I recalled from my 1st visit a while back, they were yummy too"}
{"text":"Easily one of Charlotte's best eats. Everything on their menu is amazing. Our first brunch experience was about a month ago and have been every Sunday since. Alex is one of the servers that never ceases to amaze. She is so kind and knowledgable. Definitely an asset to their team. Ask for her next time you're in on a Sunday. And as far as the food well...

A couple of must-haves:
Steak and eggs- get the grits and extra hollandaise sauce (trust me)
The bacon & shallot muscles (ask for more bread you're gonna need it)
And if you still have room... 
The crepe Suzette... to die for

We typically opt for mimosas at brunch but they have a variety of cocktails and craft beers."}
{"text":"Crepes, delicious crepes. Savory and sweet! And great beers on tap or if you prefer it, French press coffee.

Mrs. K and I popped in here on our way to north Charlotte and we were very pleased. She absolutely raved about the Crepe Suzette that she demolished while my crepe with duck confit and caramelized shallots was absolutely excellent. One pot of French press between us was enough to chase away the spiderwebs.

Great service, not too busy when we stopped in, and excellent food. All we need now is better parking!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is fantastic. Try the Brussels sprouts first, accompanied by the mussel special of the day. The oysters are also delicious! Plus you can always expect a great beer, wine and liquor selection."}
{"text":"Did someone say Crepe?!?!?!

This place wasn't at all what I expected.  I regret that I have not returned to try a dessert crepe....or two!  In the heart of NoDa this was an impromptu stop to satisfy the need for dinner before heading out for beer with a friend and fellow Yelper.  At his suggestion, we grabbed a quick bite here vs. the crowded option across the street.  I was all around pleased with the atmosphere, service and menu options.  Wine and beer available along with daily specials.  The pesto brie fries are a must try.  The only downside was that the noise level, at least at dinner, was not conducive to casual conversation."}
{"text":"How do I love thee...let me count the ways:

1. Queen City Crêpe sans chicken/bacon is my go-to
2. Their fries are surprisingly delicious
3. Dessert crepes do not disappoint
4. Cellar cider, the component parts change seasonally, but occasionally contains Goldschläger
5. Arrive early, and you're more likely to be seated without a wait

It's really a NoDa mainstay, and every time I drive by I wonder why I'm not inside savoring a delicious crêpe."}
{"text":"Love the crepes here! They also have great specials, and a local favorite- the pesto Brie French fries. And if you get Colleen to make you a cocktail, you won't be dissatisfied. She can make a mean drink!"}
{"text":"Updated Review!

Recently went back to Crepe Cellar and ordered the mussels--they were awesome. These were the standard mussels on the menu, and the sauce was awesome. We ordered extra bread to sop it up with, the flavor was perfect. We each ordered a savory crepe and really enjoyed them...along with parmesan fries! 

Great drink selection as always and the service was attentive and friendly. In general, I have been incredibly impressed with the customer service provided by the front of house staff as well as management, I'm happy to give my business to a restaurant that seems to truly appreciate customers."}
{"text":"If your in NoDa the Crepe Cellar is a good spot to eat. Typically I eat at Cabo FIsh Taco and go to Crepe Cellar for a dessert Crepe, but I have had some of the savory crepes here. In terms of crepes these are top notch. Ive been several times and intend to continue. There's even a bar in there if you want to have a drink but stay away from the noisy crowd."}
{"text":"Been here once and had a great experience.  I had a dessert crepe that was well prepared and abundant in chocolate, nutella, strawberries, nuts and fresh whip!  Crepe was perfectly thin, fluffy and delicate.  The filling was intense!  Exactly what i was looking for a Saturday brunch, paired with a cup of french pressed coffee.  Divine!  

Gotta go again and try some of the savory crepes.  To be continued.....  ;)"}
{"text":"Great balls of fire! Found a new brunch spot. Yaye. They won me over from the time we walked in,from the host that greeted us at the door, to our waitress, and the fact that its in the noda art district. The young lady that was our waitress was more than nice and explained alot of the dishes on the menu even went on to tell us that their burger won the best burger and fries i want to say last year.

Our food  by no means we had no complaints! My friend ordered the award winning burger that she could not stop boasting about how good it was, and i ordered the chicken crepe and fries. When i say my food was so good it made you want to jump up and slap your mama! Some special sauce that i can not explain its taste drizzled on top of my crepe was so mouth drooling good. Please don't get me started on the chicken inside of the crepe, that was oh so juicy, tender, and tasty. My stomach is growling as i sit here speaking on all of this goodness we had here at Crepe Cellar.

Decor you ask? The vibe in here was real chill. The only part i hate that being that it was such a nice day i would have not minded if we sat on a patio but they don't have a patio here.Wooden unique wine case behind the booths was a nice touch with wine bottles set up for display and may have been for sale who knows. For everyone that hangs out in noda, rather you live here or you don't you most definitely want to come grab a meal here. Matter fact i think im going back this weekend."}
{"text":"Don't even hesitate.  Just go.  I've been 2-3 times in recent years (not nearly enough) and it's stellar each time, in both food and service.  The brussels sprouts are perfection in a bowl.  My date and I shared those and split a burger since neither of us was starving.  Now, I'm no burger connoisseur but on the rare occasion I order one I want it to be off the charts.  So often at restaurants I'm disappointed by the lack of flavor in the all American burger.  How hard can it be?  Well, Crepe Cellar nails it with their signature burger.  We ordered it medium rare, and it was absolutely, hands down, the best burger I've been served.  Anywhere.  Hated to share it.

The service is always good.  Never fawning, always comfortably attentive, and the servers are good at making suggestions.  I was considering a fun cocktail which is atypical for me, and they described it to a tee.  Delish!"}
{"text":"Awful service, food is mediocre and overrated. They shouldn't call themselves a Crêpe shop when they cannot make a decent crepe period point blank. Would not recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Loved the ambience. A little loud but still felt intimate. Mussels and Brie fries were great. The Arugula salad was good and interested flavor combo. The crepe we orderd was so so, would still return again."}
{"text":"Another special occasion means another visit to Crepe Cellar!! We have been coming to this place for several years now and it only gets better! The people who work here like our favorite, Catherine, always go out of their way to make you feel welcome and taken care of. We love coming here and appreciate the awesome vibe it always has. We have too many favorites to pick one, give it a try, you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"I went to crepe cellar on a Friday night with a friend. Had about an hour wait when we arrived. Being located in Noda it has a nice quaint feeling, small tables, close together. Almost too small for the demand. 

For my entree I got the spinach and wild mushroom savory buckwheat crepe and added chicken for an additional charge. I also substituted and got a house salad for my side item. The crepe was okay. It was nothing special. Before going, I was kind of not that into it because when I think of crepes I think of delicious dessert-y things like fruit and chocolate. But I decided to give the savory buckwheat crepes a try. I was not blown away. Everything tasted good, but it just wasn't something I would ever crave. The friend I was with ordered the rosemary and thyme roasted chicken. That was also good - but who goes to a crepe restaurant for a half a chicken? 

We split the banana fosters dessert crepe. Obviously this was the highlight of the meal. The crepe was cooked perfect, fresh bananas, good taste. Very rich of course. If I go back and I would just order ALL OF THE DESSERT CREPES. haha"}
{"text":"Went in to have dinner for the first time here, but the hostess seemed annoyed, and wasn't very welcoming, so we left."}
{"text":"One of my favorite date spots. Oddly enough, I tend to avoid the crepes altogether - but everything else on the menu is always delicious. My personal favorites include the Burrata appetizer, the burger, brussel sprouts, and steak & guinness pie. They also have a great cocktail selection that changes seasonally. 

Cannot wait until their new southern concept restaurant opens down the street!"}
{"text":"The place that originally brought me to NODA....what can I say about a place that has that much pull. 

It's a place that tops many of my lists including First Date, Best Burger, Top Fries, and to many others to list. 

I never understood just how important this restaurant was to my pallet until I broke away from the crêpes. For the first year of dining here, I didn't order anything other then there crapes. I have now found that their are other food is absolutely unbelievable.  I'm not one to recommend particular dishes since food is such a personal desire; however, I do feel the need to point out that their burger and chicken Cordon Bleu Sandwich is a must try if you never have had it."}
