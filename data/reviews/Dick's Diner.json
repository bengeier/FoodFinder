{"text":"My wife and I went out of our way to eat here after hearing about it on a business trip in florida of all places.  We were highly disappointed, she had a bland plate of house recommended spaghetti, our kids had what appeared to be microwaved burgers (though we know they weren't) and i had a meatloaf that could have been served on the pondarosa buffett.  We did order dessert because that was what semmed to be their speciaLty.  I enjoyed a nice chocolate cream pie and the wife.was dissapointed when hers (just like mine) showed up with more mmerange than pie.  I have heard a lot of buzz about this place in variuos circles, but we wont eat here again or recommend it either."}
{"text":"Great food at Dick's. The food selection is exactly what you want when your going there. Diner food at its best. I tried the got turkey sandwich with gravy over everything. I finished pretty fast. I recommend to anyone who wants classic diner food."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE Dick's Diner!  We stop in once every few weeks and have no trouble picking one of the daily specials--there are always ample choices.

Most meals come with two sides and are just under the $10 mark--makes a great place to bring a family if you're concerned about breaking the bank.  The side dish options are plentiful; I usually go for the baked potato, which is always presented with enough butter and sour cream (bonus!) and comes at no extra charge, unlike many other places I've been.

Even when the restaurant is busy, we are usually greeted by a host/hostess before we even make our way towards the dining room, and are seated with glasses of ice water. This is old school, and a nice touch.  All the servers we've ever had have all been very courteous and attentive, so we've never experienced issues getting our check or a refill on a beverage.

If you're searching for a place that serves meals like your mother used to make, look no further. And don't forget to order a slice of pie before you leave!  I'm usually too full from the large meal portions, but my husband can vouch!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch and had a great meal that you wouldn't find in many, if any other restaurants... Corned beef hash.  

Food was great, service was excellent and friendly.

I normally stick with the chain restaurants for brunch, but based on this experience, I'll re think from this point forward and will come back for sure!

PS: their pies are to die for ... And very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Food is good reasonably priced diner fare. But the pie!! Most excellent coconut cream pie! I don't like meringue on my coconut cream pie, but I gladly make the exception at Dicks. Fluffy, piled high, and tender without the awful powered meringue taste. Huge amount of coconut in the pie, in a flaky tender crust that melts in your mouth. Worth the trip just to have the pie."}
{"text":"Oh Dick's Diner!  This place is the bomb, hands down.  Great food, decent portions, and service with a smile!  They usually have fixed specials so whatever is the special is on tuesday, it has been that forever.  The best part is the desserts.  The pie is out of this world and you will not find a better lemon pie!

We come here often, it's great!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Dick's Diner the other day by myself at 8 p.m. after a haircut and cozied up the the lunch counter where mocking me from afar were several mile-high pies. And at that point I at least knew pie would be in my future.

Dick's Diner is not really a diner from an architecture standpoint. The building looks like a bank from 1970 to me. From a menu standpoint though, it hits the standards: Hot Beef Sandwich, Triple Decker Club sandwich, Liver and Onions, Double Cheeseburger, milkshakes, pies, and an extensive breakfast menu.

After seriously contemplating getting breakfast, I went with meatloaf which came with 2 sides (mashed potatoes and a salad to make myself feel better).

My salad was out before I had time to even finish taking in the sights and sounds around me. It was a basic diner salad complete with iceberg lettuce, wedges of tomato, red onion, shredded purple cabbage, thick slices of cucumber, and of course the good kind of ranch. It was also accompanied by a split top roll and SOFT butter. I seriously love me some soft butter when I actually use butter.

Shortly after I finished my salad, a glorious plate of thinly sliced meatloaf and mashed potatoes showed up. Now this meatloaf can't even come close to my mother's but it certainly hit the spot. It was tender and flavorful and swimming in a hearty beefy gravy. The mashed potatoes were whipped to a smooth perfection and stick-to-your-ribs hearty. It might not have been a 4 star meal, but it certainly satisfied my late night craving.

Plus I took a piece of coconut cream pie to go which in my book is never a bad thing."}
{"text":"Dick's is my favorite local Diner since moving the area 7 years ago.  They have never once let me down with a home cooked to order meal.  Having an array of fresh deserts is always a hallmark of a Diner to me.  I'd rather spend my money at Dick's than a chain. The service has always been good.  Some mornings they seem me coming in the door and have the coffee waiting.  If it isn't too busy I'll have my breakfast within minutes cooked to order and be in and out and on my way to work with a good start to the day."}
{"text":"OMG! Once you go their for the first time you can't drive  past it without going in!!! Their French onion soup is amazing! The waitresses are kind and friendly! Totally Recommend!"}
{"text":"We go here alot after church.... They've got pretty good, affordable food.... Not fancy... But clean and comfortable little diner with a good staff of waiters and waitresses. For ten years i had driven by this place and never stopped until about a year and a half ago.... Now it's a regular! Don't get me wrong... It's nothing special, though..... Just a cheap, decent place to eat."}
{"text":"Peanut Butter Cream Pie.  If I just ate that here then this would be a 5 star place.  I came for breakfast and came back later to pick up pie to go.  If you are driving on 22 towards Pittsburgh then this is the perfect place to grab some pie.  They sell it for $3.19 to 3.49 a slice depending on what kind.  They sell whole pies for around $13.  The slices are huge and perfect for 2, also perfect for 1.  They are known for Cocunut Cream but they also have dutch apple, chocolate cream, boston cream, and about 10 more kinds.  The cream is piled huge on the cream pies.  These pies are done right.

This place is pretty good for a breakfast  place but for a place that makes their biscuits, I was disappointed that they don't have biscuits and gravy.  I ordered the breakfast platter with 2 pancakes (nice flavor, medium fluffiness with some denseness), 2 eggs, home fries, and some smoky bacon.  My bacon was cooked a minute or two too long.  This plate for $7.99 is a decent deal and enough for me and to share with my 3 year old.  My wife ordered an omelette and was happy with her order.  I wish I would have got the hash browns as they make them similar to Mcdonalds.  One of my friends said her omelette and food make this a 5 star place.  This place was packed for Friday morning.  I wish they had a few more niche breakfast options but they do well with the basics.  I would go here over Dennys, Ihop, or other chain breakfast places.  If driving towards Idlewild from pittsburgh then this is a perfect pplace to stop for a family breakfast.  We had four little kids between us and they were quick enough with the food that the kids didn't have time to get super bored.  Waitstaff was great as well.  They didn't have room to move our tables together but we beside each other.

Booths, bar seating, and dining room give plenty of room.  Great pie and a good diner breakfast."}
{"text":"Great to amazing breakfast. We had to wait a little while to be seated around 10 AM but that is to be expected. 

We were visiting from out of town and wanted a local breakfast to try and Dick's Diner delivers. We had the eggs benedict (yum) and standard orders of pancakes, overeasy eggs, sausage links (YUM) and french toast. We will skip the french toast next time (dry) and stick with the basics. 

We also indulged on the most amazing piece of coconut cream pie (merengue to die for, really) and the perfect amount of cream. We also tried a piece of the custard pie but do not get it if you do not like nutmeg, it really overpowers the custard and you won't like it. I wish they made a non nutmeg version of the custard pie, it would be a total win for us. 

Overall, amazing staff, great eats and your typical diner atmosphere."}
{"text":"My mom wanted to stop here for breakfast one morning. I ordered a cheese omelette that was very overpriced and just so-so in taste/quality.

My mom's breakfast was also insanely overpriced,, I mean come on people, eggs and potatoes and toast are some of the cheapest things you can buy these days. There was no excuse for spending close to 20$ for two plates of eggs ...

What really burned me up was their pie.. I got 3 slices to go, 1 for me 1 for my husband and 1 for my mom to take home.. Got the cherry cream and 2 slices of the chocolate peanut butter. Sounds tasty huh? Think again, cherry cream was tasteless and had a thick blubber like sludge (guessing this was the \"cream\" part) with a razor thin layer of some cherry gel like substance that tasted very  processed and phony. I gagged down 2 bites then fed the rest to the trash can. 

The choc peanut butter was no better. Both of them had an obnoxious amount of meringue on top, reminded me of coagulated dog spit. 

Bottom line I guess is this place is for elderly locals. Or the type of person who refuses to step out of their comfort zone from 30 yrs ago."}
{"text":"Stop in for a great old school breakfast with the locals. Try their homemade nut sweet roll--get it grilled--perfection and plenty to share!"}
{"text":"Terrible place. Entrance reeks of smoke. Decor is old, bland and depressing. Everything is overpriced and they love extra charges, like $1 for a biscuit instead of toast, and $2.30 for egg whites which I wasn't told about beforehand $2.30 for egg whites?! You can buy a dozen eggs for $3.50! Food is bland and tasteless. My extra-charge biscuit was somehow dry and soggy at the same time. Home fries are dry and tasteless, bacon looked like shards of bacon taken from better cuts of bacon. Go alittle up the road to kings or even McDonalds. Shame on you Dicks! I'm very surprised at the good reviews for this place. By far the worst $12 breakfast I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Great diner food. Had the turkey sandwich with home fries. Also had the coconut cream pie. While it's not super healthy, it's so good."}
{"text":"Solid diner food with a nicer than average atmosphere. Their hot sandwiches are they way to go. I deviated today and was sorry. Fish sandwich was fair. but oh! the pies!! worth the 4th star for the pie!"}
{"text":"Exactly what a diner should be. Quick, affordable, delicious eats. Soup and sandwich options are solid. Hot Roast Beef or Turkey are great comfort food in the winter. Friendly staff. The pies are huge!"}
{"text":"When I was 16, I started working at Giant Eagle as a bag girl.  I hated it.  So i found a new job.  I worked as a waitress at Dick's Dinner from when i was 16- 18.  It was my favorite most pleasurable waitress job I have ever had.  They have regulars, and I mean regular everyday at the same time the same men show up and have coffee in the same way (i might even still have a few names and orders memorized).  They have waitresses that have worked there since the day it opened. IN FACT, most of the people i worked with are the VERY same people that still work there.  Loretta, Ruthy, they were some of the best when I was there.  

The people are amazing people. I never met the Original Dick was the buyer and when he bought it was 1948 and was just a railway car.  Then they made it a non-moving rail car, They then they made it a real building (all counter with stools) then it expanded to a dining room. THEN they added on even more. Now Little Dick owns it and he is running it the same way his dad did.  Family owned and family run.  I love it. 

Recommendations: Mac and Cheese. Its perfect. Baked and wonderful.  I know this is going to sound weird... but let it get alittle cold and it takes it to another level. I love it.  Maybe that's just because they would give me all that was left in a to-go container after my shift and i would eat it a little cold.  OH I LOVE THAT MAC AND CHEESE.  

REASON OTHER PEOPLE GO THERE: PIE.  They do a Meringue like you would not believe. They have every type too. Chocolate. Graham Cracker. Peanut Butter. Banana Cream Pie (they won an award from Pittsburgh on the pie).  They also have THE BEST PUMPKIN PIE I HAVE EVER EATEN.  The combination of spices is unlike anything i have ever made or had.  Its amazing.  They do about 20 different Pies. OH and they make the milkshakes from real ice cream (Kings Family Restaurant Ice Cream- Also Pittsburgh Brand)

REASON I GO THERE: BREAKFAST. It ain't special. It ain't anything crazy. Its just Breakfast. They way a diner should be. THE MURRYSVILLE PRIDE IS THE WAY TO GO: Two Eggs, Home fries, Toast,  and Two Pancakes.  We went there EVERY Sunday when I was little and now EVERY WEEKEND I go back to Pittsburgh, On Sunday morning all 8 of us (my family plus my husbands) Eat there. Its a tradition and Its my very special place. 

Dick's Dinner will forever be my most special and favorite place to eat in my hometown."}
{"text":"Great diner! Tried one of the specials and I'm more than full. Everything was tasty and served with a smile. Fast service and decent prices. I will definitely be back to try some homemade pie!"}
{"text":"Home cooked meals, very affordable pricing, and fast and courteous service.   They are known for their pies and they do deliver on taste when it comes to that.  I had the Banana Cream and it was very good. It is one of the best dinner foods I have had.  I highly recommend the Shepherds pie which is a special they had on Wednesday night."}
{"text":"Best pies in murrysville/monroeville area!! The peanut butter cream, coconut cream and banana cream are so delish! Great to order a day in advance and pick up next day! They definitely don't skimp on the meringue! Nicely priced too!"}
{"text":"Dick's Diner has consistently good food and service. Their breakfasts and lunches (sandwiches) are fantastic but I'm not a fan of their dinners. I love their home made soup and chili. I'm pretty sure that most of their food is home made. 

Dick's is an excellent place for a good meal. I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"They have best pies that I have ever ate. The cherry pie is like old fashioned pies were made. Food is excellent."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the first time a few weeks ago for breakfast. Dick's was easy to find and we had no problems with parking. It almost reminded us of a King's. We went on a Saturday and there was plenty of seating. Our waitress was attentive and polite. My husband ordered the Eggs Benedict and added a side of bacon. According to him, the Eggs Benedict was alright. The bacon was good, but seemed expensive for a side of bacon. (Around $3?) I had the chocolate chip pancakes. They were average. Basically, our food was good, but nothing special. We may go back if we're in the area."}
{"text":"This old school diner provides decent food at an affordable price.  First time here was over a decade ago and it was for breakfast.  I decided to try some lunch.  They don't have a website so it was a game time decision when it came to ordering.  Walking into Dick's is sort of like walking back in time.  The place is old and it doesn't try to hide that. However, it's clean and the server was very nice.  They have a page in their menu for specials.  I don't know if these are rotating specials, daily or weekly specials, or lunch specials.  Can't say for sure. 

Noted in the specials were many \"classic\" diner dishes.  Meatloaf, turkey sandwich and gravy, ham and potatoes, roast beef and gravy, just to name a few.  Also located on this special's menu was a \"lighter\" section, listing a piece of grilled chicken on a bed of dirty rice, served with a roll and a side.  I opted for a side salad as my side, and tossed the roll aside as I had no interest.  The salad was standard.  Nothing stood out.  The dirty rice was cooked nicely as was the decent portion of grilled chicken strips that lay on top.  They were warm and nothing tasted dry though it was a little under seasoned.  It was a nice healthier meal option than say a stack of meatloaf covered in gravy, so kudos to them for having some wholesome options.  

Top it off the prices are affordable and in line with what other places would charge for comparable items and portions."}
{"text":"Old school diner. Cheap, consistently decent, simple, home made food. Nothing fancy but this place keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Dick's is an old-fashioned, all-American diner.  The place is dated...seemingly on purpose and not in a bad way...just reminiscent of diners of the 70's and 80's. 

The food is...classic diner fare. You come to Dick's for breakfast you could, but don't want to, make at home and for sandwiches that are wholesome and made with that one ingredient you seemingly don't have in your pantry or fridge. 

It's a diner...and by knowing what it is, you get what you came in the door for - decent, satisfying food at a reasonable price.  

All the food is delivered with friendly and smiling service...so you may just have to save room for one of their delicious pies to put a smile on your face as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I chose to stop by Dick's because it has a 4-star rating and... well, it's a Diner. My grandmother worked in a good old-fashioned diner in LA when I was growing up, and so I suppose I was feeling a bit nostalgic seeing that cuisine type listed. Inside, the restaurant was dingy and worn out, but all of the servers were cheerful despite working quickly because of how busy they were. I mean, if a restaurant is that busy and you're waiting in line to be seated already feeling a bit skeptical, it is hard to not start to feel optimistic.

We were seated after only about 15 minutes at a table right next to the Hostess stand... a bit of odd placement but it was the only table, so we took it. I ordered the meatloaf special with mac 'n cheese and a side salad. I didn't pay attention to what my husband ordered because my food was terrible and I was focused on its quality. The salad was fine and was a decent small dinner salad. No complaints there. The meatloaf, however? It was grey and dry... and sliced like a loaf of bread. Perhaps meatloaf is different than how we make it in CA, but GREY? It seemed like it wasn't actually meat. I had about 3 bites and just couldn't do it anymore. I ate the mac 'n cheese to ensure I had some sort of sustenance. After all, we were still going to have to pay for this inedible food. It was watery and salty.

On the way home, my husband and I were trying to figure out who in the world is giving this place such high reviews! The place is packed every evening and the service was pleasant and quick, but the food was truly awful. Maybe breakfast is better? I'm not sure... What I am sure of is that we will never be back. Sorry to say!"}
{"text":"If you aren't from around the area Dicks probably isn't on your list of stops to make. Here's why it should be. Almost everything tastes like your mom made it- and it feels like your own kitchen/ dining room inside. No frills- home cooked meals. They have everything from grilled cheeses to full meals. Staff knows the regulars by name- and the regulars might kick you out of their bar seats but that's ok! Top pick - coconut cream pie bigger than your hand, you have to try it!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in at least 20 years! What a great spot for breakfast. The menu is somewhat limited, nothing fancy, but good diner food.  We arrived at 9:30 on a Saturday and didn't have to wait, but by 10am the line was out the door.  I ordered blueberry pancakes, but what they gave me were chocolate chip. No worries, they were amazing. My husband got the corned beef hash and said it was some of the best he has had.  The portions are just right!"}
{"text":"Old school diner spot with counter spots in addition to a decent amount of seating. Usually pretty busy on weekend mornings once the church behind it lets out, but they typically move thru the line quickly. 

The menu is pretty basic, which isn't always a bad thing and that's definitely the case here as far as breakfast is concerned. Anything I've ever had has been pretty good from bacon and eggs, to pancakes, to breakfast sandwiches. The staff is always very friendly and attentive, and the prices are low. Good spot."}
{"text":"This is one of those old school restaurants - full of old locals who've been going there for 30 years!  good coffee, good potatoes, and the sausage was yummy... also loved that they had apple cinnamon jam!"}
{"text":"Enjoyable, but not fantastic. Dick's Diner serves decent food, but it's more about the tradition and long-standing employees and customers than it is about really spectacular food. I can't think of any places in Murrysville that are definitely better- but that doesn't exactly mean Dick's Diner is an A+ place to eat."}
{"text":"Your classic Sunday brunch church crew type of place. Fresh, homemade pies made daily that you can't pass up and prices that are unbeatable. The servers are happy to be there making it a little more memorable. Very convenient and also quick service. Minimum wait to be served."}
{"text":"Oh my god, the food is amazing here. I have never had anything I did not enjoy eating. Service is great, a great family place to eat. And do not forget to get some pie to finish off your meal."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Dick's Diner a handful of times - mostly for breakfast. I grew up working in diners on the other side of PA so I have a soft spot for a good diner-y breakfast.

My most recent visit here was no exception. Eggs over easy, sausage links and hashbrowns...mmmhmmm. Though my dining companion urged me to get the regular homefries, I opted for the hashbrowns and was not disappointed! Hot, crisp and a bit greasy - just perfect, really. 

Dick's is apparently also well-known for their pies. While I had no room left for dessert, my dining companions did and this time, my friend let me have a bite - unlike our breakfast the previous day at Pamela's. The pie was delicious - buttery, flaky crust protecting a delicious fresh fruit filling. Oh yeah...gluttony at its finest.

The servers here are very friendly and treat you like a regular (even if you're just an out-of-town visitor!). No doubt Dick's will continue to be a breakfast destination spot every time I visit my friends in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Nice menu. Typical dinner fare. Very good tuna melt. Large selection of pies. Better than a chain."}
{"text":"Food good. Prices fair. Friendly staff
Try the roast beef sandwich. Their beef gravy is good over the sandwich and the fries.   Good selection of pies.  This is one of those \"old school\"  independently owned businesses that I love to patronize.  The food and service is consistent so you know what to expect... and I'm never disappointed.  A good bet anytime."}
{"text":"While driving through Murrysville, my daughter noticed Dick's Diner, and being that she loves breakfast for dinner we decided to stop. 

Drinks:  Kids got a chocolate milkshake which they shared.  It came in the classic metal serving cup (which always adds to the fun of getting a milkshake).  The color seemed light for it being chocolate, but that did not slow them down at all. 
 
Food:  We had the variety pack of food at the table.  First, was a kid's hot dog with a side of fruit for my son.  He loves hot dogs, but this one was much more perfect for an adult.  It was a  ¼ pound full beef hotdog with a grilled bun.  Actually, I know that it was pretty good because I ate  1/2 of it.  His fruit was a nice variety of pineapple, cantaloupe, and melon; all of which was sweet.   My daughter got the country breakfast which came with just about anything you could think of for breakfast.  She enjoyed everything but the sausage, but my son loved that, so it was a nice switch for the other half of the hotdog.  I got my standard diner food -- the hot beef sandwich with French fries and gravy over everything.   The roast beef was a little dry but the gravy made up for it.  I have had better in other places but if I went back, I would probably get it again.      
 
Pros:  It is clean.  The service is prompt and very friendly.  
 
Cons:  Nothing major that I can think of.  To reach for something the décor is dated, but it is a diner so what do you expect. 
 
Conclusion:  We enjoyed it and would go back down the road."}
{"text":"When we lived in the Monroeville area, we frequented Dick's Diner quite often. But we moved to the North Hills and I hadn't been to the diner in at least 25 years. 

Yesterday I had the rare opportunity to breakfast with a friend at Dick's Diner. And I am pleased to say that things there are as great as they aver were!

Great food. My breakfast -- pancakes & bacon -- was really tasty. Pancakes really light and fluffy. My friend had Eggs Benedict and loved it. Plus, really friendly and efficient service. 

Too good to not return. I'm going to make the effort to get there more often!"}
{"text":"Dick's Diner is a classic American diner, that serves up great food.  The staff are always very nice, and the prices are reasonable. I had the Sheppard's Pie and Mac & Cheese. The Sheppard's pie was a little greasy, but that is what makes it good. The Mac & Cheese taste just like what my Grandmother use to make.  If in the area, this is a must stop."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast on New Year's Eve, and I liked my meal, which consisted of perfect eggs, awesome bacon, and something that I think was cornmeal mush that was fantastic. The service was friendly and efficient. 

Yes, I got a flat tire here after hitting the curb on the way in."}
{"text":"My first visit to this quaint diner. There were countertop seats with stools available when you first walked in. The party I was with sat in a back room. Atmosphere was nice. 

The seating was interesting for 8 people. They put us at a round table with a square table on one side. It was somewhat difficult to communicate across the distance of the tables.

The server was nice. She forgot to bring several things out to the table and there was a mistake with my meal. Overall a pleasant experience. 

Food was hot and tasty. The mistake on my order was that I requested a cup of soup and received a full bowl. I enjoyed the potato soup and it filled me up so much I couldn't eat more than a few bites of my meal. The turkey sandwich with gravy was flavorful. I got a side of onion rings which were 4 out of 10. They were frozen, not fresh. A lot of batter and strong onion flavor without much flavor on the coating. The server initially  forgot to bring a side of ranch dressing and brought one at the end of the meal. 

I would have loved to try the pie since they looked amazing and everyone at my table was raving about them. Maybe next time..."}
{"text":"I give it a 3star because the place was clean ,staff friendly and food was good. However the PRICES were very expensive and not dine like at all. The portions were small 9.oo for a Ruben sandwich with no sides and two flimsy pickles. Fries were a extra charge at 3.oo and there weren't that many. So buyer beware food was ok but prices very high"}
{"text":"I like this place.  The food and service were good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.  I had the Boston Cream Pie and the Apple Pie.  Both were good, however, it was nothing mind blowing.  Maybe the other reviews had given me too high of expectations.  Nonetheless, I may be back to try breakfast next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Really delicious pancakes! This is been open forever but I went for the first time yesterday. I was there for a work meeting that could have been over about 40 minutes sooner if the server had stopped over to take our credit card. Other than that, everyone was kind and the place seemed clean. Everyone at our table enjoyed their food!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with friends from Ohio. We met here since its half way between where we live. I got the chocolate chip pancakes and bacon. The pancakes where very good, the best I've had in a while and the bacon (my favorite food!) was cooked perfectly! 

For desert, we got a marbled cake with whipped cream icing and it was very good also."}
{"text":"We stopped in today for the first time. The waitress, Lisa, was super nice and attentive. The food was really good for the price. It tastes like a combination of grandma's cooking and old fashioned diner food. The atmosphere was actually pretty cozy and comfortable, too. My boyfriend got a fish sandwich that was simple but (the one bite I got to try) was probably one of the best around. Reminded me of a fish sandwich we got at the beach a couple years ago. The hash browns were delicious patties, also probably the best we've had. He also said the fries were incredible. 2 full meals, drinks, and soup, under $40. We each brought half our meals home, so definitely get your money worth. Well go back and try some of their desserts for sure!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for Pie!  Large selection with Mile High Meringue!  Service with a smile."}
{"text":"Dicks brings back such fond memories...I was born and raised in Los Angeles...But my dad was from the area. And every time we came to Pittsburgh we had to go to Dicks! The gravey french fies were my favorite. The one thing I can remember never understanding was the pie selection, everything was merangue...even though it said it was bannana cream, it was merangue...thats why you dont get 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute. It has the east coast diner feel. The food was tasty. I had the stuffed  fish with cauliflower. The cauliflower was steamed, the rice pilaf and fish were great tasting. The service wasn't that great, the lady was pretty slow for not being busy. They have a long diner bar you can sit at which looked cool. I would love to stop at this place again."}
{"text":"Nice local diner with homemade food and good service. An oasis in a desert of chain restaurants. Expect long lines Sunday after church."}
{"text":"We are from out of town. A women at our hotel suggested Dicks diner. Great food, great service, great prices and clean! Awesome. We suggest \"the country\" for breakfast."}
{"text":"We tried this place on a whim, and was not disappointed. It looked to be busy, but the wait wasn't long. Maybe 5-7 minutes.  This was around 9:45am on a Saturday.  By the time we left, around 10:45, the line was much longer. The service was great. The food was well prepared, and tasted very good.  The restaurant was clean and well kept. We will visit again!"}
{"text":"As other reviewers have pointed out, Dick's Diner isn't just about the food.  It's also about tradition, community, friendly people, and great conversations.  It's very telling that the same servers have been there since I started going to Dick's more than 22 years ago.  Mr. Rogers from Mr. Rogers neighborhood was known to go to Dick's for breakfast. 

I often go sit at the counter for a cup of soup, some of their awesome mac and cheese, and a milkshake to talk about upcoming Penguins or Steelers games with other locals and the servers.  I can always count on a good meal at Dick's even if the food is nothing particularly special.  Good old fashioned comfort food is what I'm expecting when I go to Dick's and they really know how to do that right. 

I must say however that their pies are some of the best I've ever had.  A slice of pie probably measures about 5 or 6 inches tall and you'll most likely have to take some of it home.  The chocolate peanut butter cream has always been my favorite but I also love the Boston cream, banana cream and coconut cream.  

Part of the charm about Dick's Diner is that it is so unassuming and simple.  If you're looking for food that's unique or stands out from the rest, you may be disappointed.  But if you want a true cultural experience and a good meal that tastes home cooked, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Dick's Diner is a Murrysville tradition for breakfast...and pie.  Usually when I eat here the waitress looks at me like I am crazy for the amount of food I am ordering, but it never fails that I will eat every bite.  I can really put down breakfast food, but always make sure to leave some room for Coconut Cream Pie!  I usually don't really like pie, but Dick's Diner makes the absolute best Coconut Cream, it's impossible to pass up!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Eggs extremely fresh and potatoes done perfectly. Full house at 10 a.m. and everyone being taken care of. Wait staff extremely friendly and proficient.  Even tempted us with one of their fabulous home made pies. I came recall how many years ago they opened but I know I was a very young child when my father's took me. Mother loved the banana cream pie."}
{"text":"This is a swell place to get a good filling meal quickly!  I've never been in a rush here, but my order always comes out fast. As for the food, the omelets are always a winner for breakfast, later in the day get one of the daily soups, I haven't been disappointed with one yet.  To top it off all the pies are homemade and great.  It's cheap, fast, AND good."}

The New Year's Ordeal: Part One!

It was 6:30AM New Year's Eve morning. The weather was unseasonably balmy, and a mist hung heavy in the darkness just before dawn. We were traveling east towards Benton, the mountain home of Kay's grandparents. This 4.5 hour trip was familiar as this was the fourth time within a year that I had done this with her. Each time we passed Dick's Diner from and towards Pittsburgh. That this diner had been standing since 1946 piqued my interest. 

As we tried to drive into the parking lot, Kay hit the curb violently. We got out, checked for damage, saw nothing, and went inside. 

The menu is glaringly basic with the exception of having trout on their menu. Being way too early for trout, I simply went with a hot chipped ham sandwich with lettuce, tomato, fried onion, American cheese, and an over-easy egg. 

Devotee of chipped ham...that I am, I was inspired when I saw \"The Slammer\" being prepared at Isaly's West View on one of Rick Sebak's local PBS specials. I had been eating chipped ham cold for so long that I had never thought to fry it up in a skillet. Once I did, I almost didn't want it cold any longer. This processed meat almost evanesced in my mouth, the slightly blackened, crispy edges acting as the blown kiss after a brief fling. Only mayo, a potato bun, and cheese were necessary.

Dick's take on this was disappointingly arid. The onions became stringy and were difficult to break with my teeth. I'd take a bite and pull half the contents of the sandwich out with the onions. Perhaps I should have just gotten an omelet. 

Not all was lost, however. The french fries were superbly golden, crunchy, and steamin'. The only thing I didn't like about my chocolate peanut butter pie was that there was meringue where fresh whipped cream should have been and that there was a whit too much of it. Our server Denise was chipper in spite of the ungodly hour and missed not one note. 

Call my rating a high 3. I would like to return to try that trout. 

When we came out to the car after eating, we found that the front passenger side tire of Kay's automobile was flat and that the rim was bent. The nightmarish saga begins..."}
{"text":"It puzzles me how a diner can make food for so long and still serve a meal which has almost no flavor.

One thing I found irksome was I ordered grapefruit juice, they waiter ASSURED me I would get grapefruit juice, not the blended Ruby Red juice cocktail stuff.  The waiter lied."}
{"text":"It's bigger than your typical diner, and has the old school feel of the older King's from the Pittsburgh area. We went on a Saturday morning and they were moderately busy but we we seated within minutes. Our server was great and had no problem with our configurations to our orders, such as letting me sub fruit for home fries. I ordered a western omelet which was very good, and the side of fruit ending up being a quartered cantaloupe on a plate with a knife. You really can't get any fresher than that. It was good food, good service, good coffee, and good prices."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times. Food is very good and portions are right for the price...most of the time. Can not beat the pies. Great great pies. I recommend the boston cream pie...excellent & rich."}
{"text":"A very quaint family diner in Murrysville, Pa. Wholesome family diner. Clean and very family oriented. Enjoyed the Chesapeake Crab Cakes. I highly recommend if you enjoy seafood, but they also serve more traditional fare as well. Definitely will be back the next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Very good cod fish sandwich for lunch.  Macaroni and cheese and stewed tomatoes as sides were also good.  Dessert was chocolate cake with white icing and cherry cream pie.  Food was very good.  Nice place.  Will come back!"}
{"text":"Great choice for homemade pies. Both the peanut butter and coconut cream pie had flaky crust and were topped with a mountain of fluffy meringue. If you like liver and onions, try this place - the liver is juicy and nicely seasoned. They also have a good, basic BLT.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"Are you a 20-, 30-, or 40-something that would like to experience what your highlights might be as a 90-something? Let me recommend to you Dick's Diner, a single location that thinks it's a chain restaurant. In this unassuming location off of US 30 east of Pittsburgh, you can experience Dick's vision (that doesn't sound right, eh?) of a diner that doesn't challenge its customers, not in the least, unless you count seeing the scolding Dick on the wall. Hamburgers, coffee, tea, and pop, but nothing that will make you go oooooh! Safe? Yes. Predictable? Yes. Adequate? Sure. A destination? Certainly not."}
{"text":"Awesome pumpkin and lemon merengue pies, and it's a great value to buy a whole pie to go!  The lunch fare is only so-so, and I wouldn't recommend the macaroni and cheese (I think they use cheddar, so it isn't at all creamy!). My fried fish sandwich and french fries were okay but nothing to write home about.  Friendly staff and comfortable seating.  Bathrooms are a little cramped for a place so large and busy."}
