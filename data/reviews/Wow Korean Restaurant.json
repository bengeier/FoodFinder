{"text":"I visited this place once because I thought I'd explore the Korean food options in my area.   The place is very small, shabby and very mom and pop but the staff are friendly.   I tried the Seafood Tofu Stew but it was very fishy and overpoweringly salty. I can get better for the same price about 5 minutes away."}
{"text":"I love Korean home cooking and this place is legit.  No MSG and only specializes in traditional home cooked meals.  If you become a regular they will tend to give you some additional food on the house.  They're very appreciative of your business and the food is great!  I would suggest the pork bone soup (gamjatang) and the potato pancake (kamja junh)."}
{"text":"Best Korean spot in Sauga!  I have only had veggie options -  my go to of course is the Bibimbap, and any veggie ban-chan around. Always fresh, super tasty.  The meat eaters I go with lovvvvvvve this place too. The staff is super nice, they always go that extra mile, makes you feel like you're back in Korea."}
{"text":"Great Korean food place! Definitely one of the best in Mississauga. Had their pork bone soup, which was a great deal at 6.99 since it's their 13th year anniversary, and it is delicious and filling on every level. Friends got the  #0 and #2, and from what I tried theirs were very tasty as well. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Do get the soon du bu (soft tofu casserole-you get a raw egg to add yourself!) Do get the seafood pancake (made to order crispy edges and loaded with oysters and shrimps)  Do get the gam ja tang (pork bone soup-spicy and filling)   Don't get the rice sticks (duk bok ki-sauce is too sweet) Don't get the Ja jang (noodles in black bean sauce-sause is like molasses!)   Do go often and support your local eateries!!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty! High quality- would recommend to anyone who is craving for family style Korean food! The owners are very nice too!"}
{"text":"Yes please :) This place is delicious. Reminds me of the food I miss so much from Korea. I tried the basics (soondubu, dwanjang, bibimbap), and also the fun stuff, like ddeokbokki and yangnyeom chicken. Service is friendly, food comes quick, and the prices are fair. I wish they were open on Sundays though!"}
{"text":"Cute little modest place.  Good prices and really friendly owners. The hot pot with beef is super tasty (love the glass noodles) and they are generous with the free side dishes.   Great Kim chi and love the potato pancakes."}
{"text":"Not a bad meal very hearty and healthy for $8.00 you cant go wrong"}
{"text":"Had major cravings for Korean food, so decided to come here today to satisfy these feelings.  They had the doors wide open when we went there, probably to air the area out. Since it was a little chilly today, we found it to be quite cold upon entry. Fortunately, we warmed up pretty quickly after eating.   I was astonished to see that they offer Korean chicken ginseng soup for only $10.99, the same price as their seollangtang (beef bone broth). The soup was quite clear and light, and you can see the chicken oil floating on top. The serving size was decently large; it came with four sizeable pieces of chicken. Although there wasn't much of a ginseng flavour, there were two pieces each of red dates and onion, and quite a bit of black pepper bits at the bottom of the dolsot. The chicken was fall off the bone tender.  The accompanying rice was very delicious, and pleasantly surprising! It came steaming hot in a silver pressure cooker (in fact, since they have an open kitchen, we were able to see how they cook all these pressure cookers individually), and was a lovely mix of glutinous rice, black beans, forbidden (black/purple) rice, and orange sweet potato. A great healthy choice!  My parents also ordered a gamjatang, or pork bone soup, to share. It was decent, and like the chicken, the meat was very tender. The vertebrae ribs literally fell apart at the touch.  I really loved the assortment of banchan provided. The waiter was also very attentive; he came over twice - once to ask whether we needed anything and whether everything was all right (we ended up asking for an extra serving of banchan), and another time to refill our tea.  A great restaurant that we will definitely revisit!"}
{"text":"tasty????? i love the seafood hot pot here, much better than those in yonge/finch.  I will sure come back again and again."}
{"text":"Great homey and healthy Korean food. The rice they offer yeoungyang bap is really good. I would say it's the best Korean food I ever had in the GTA. The only con is that the hours later near closing time always depends on whether they are busy or not so when I come maybe 1-2 hours before, they are already closed."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is not horrible but definitely not good, but the problem I have with this place is shady or at least intentionally misleading business practices.   I came to this place on a Thursday afternoon with 3 friends. I ordered the potato pancake and pork bone soup, my friends got some bulgogi and some tofu soup. It was their 13th anniversary so I ordered the pork bone soup thinking the waiter would know I meant the $6.99 anniversary one. Food comes, both are good, pork bone soup has weaker flavor but the meat has a smoked flavor which my friend really liked but I didn't enjoy that much. Friends said the bulgogi and tofu soup were good too. Side dishes are tasty.  One of the problems here is service. I'm usually not picky with service because to me price and taste is all that matters, but here the service is really minimal. Basically, to get service you need to ask for it. I came at some obscure time so my friends and I were pretty much the only customers present. To order, to get more tea, to refill side dishes (which I got glared at for and more than once since I have come here before, but previously thought I had seen wrong), to get someone to give you the bill, you need to call the waiter over. That's not too bad a situation though since I can tell it's a family establishment and the waiter is working his ass off doing everything himself.  Also, btw for anyone who wants to know, apparently you can only refill the side dishes once (waiter told me that). That's ridiculous for anyone who's ever been there because even with my 3 friends, we only had 1 set of side dishes (they are so tiny I can finish them myself). With 4 fully grown adults there and the side dishes being so tiny, some of us couldn't even eat enough of the side dishes to actually taste the flavor. Side dishes are pretty cheap to make, and I don't know if its just this place but they were pretty stingy with it, annoyingly so for a place with not exactly cheap prices.  The biggest problem was when I got up to pay. I went up there expecting to pay $6.99 plus tax for my pork bone soup. I get told my bill is $11-something. I'm surprised, so I ask why, since the 13th anniversary poster is still up and the LED banner thing is still going off above the door. I get told that the special pork bone soup comes with white rice and the one I ordered came with nutritional purple rice. My inner mind flipped its lid and I didn't say anything and paid. I walked out of the restaurant and saw that the poster advertised the $6.99 soup with purple rice. I contemplated whether or not to go back in there and challenge the waiter about it, but my friends had somewhere to be. To be honest, I don't think I'll ever go back there. The food is good, but I found it a huge problem that the waiter didn't say anything to me (like whether I wanted purple rice or white rice or that there even was a distinction that would disqualify me from the anniversary pricing) about the pork bone soup. I felt quite cheated, and that they intentionally banked on the fact that I didn't know. Am I upset about the extra $3 dollars I paid? No, I can afford to lose it. But I am upset about being tricked. There's a very special anger when you get cheated that etches specific memories into your mind. So, to anyone who is planning on trying out this place during the anniversary pricing, I suggest you explicitly tell them you want the \"$6.99 anniversary special pork bone soup\" or whatever it is you want. My friends and I though, will definitely not be returning.  **edit : I skimmed over a couple of the other reviews for this place and saw a lot of people getting the $6.99 pork bone soup with the purple rice and not experiencing the same problem I had, so perhaps it was a fluke or they had enough angry people storming out the door. Honestly though, that one experience alone is enough for me to never go back to that place. The food's good but not great enough for me to subject myself to something like this again."}
{"text":"Went to have dinner after work. Not too many people. The tofu soup was awesome, the best I've ever had in Mississauga. It came with rice, ordinary or nutritious. Not recommend the nutritious rice, felt like only added 4 or 5 more beans. Definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time for an early dinner and found the food to be bland. Service was also slow considering there were only two tables occupied. I probably won't come here again when there are a few other Korean restaurants close by."}
{"text":"Great value and tasty!  I ordered the pork bone soup because I lack imagination and genuinely love it. Their version tastes almost exactly like Owl of Minerva's, which is a win for me. It came with a single serving tray of side dishes, rice and tea, all for $6.99 pre-tax!!   It's cafeteria seating, but there's free wifi, so it's a decent place for a solo meal."}
{"text":"For a quick bite, this is a really nice take-out place located inside the Galleria mall.   Their prices start at 6.99 + tax, and go up from there depending on what you order. I ordered a pork bone soup, which includes rice, 3 side dishes (kimchi, seaweed, and glazed potatoes).  The pork bone soup is quite good, it's not very spicy, but quite tasty.  However, you can just choose to buy the soup, and it's $2 cheaper I think. The staff is always friendly, and very quick.    What I also like is they give you a number, which flashes on a billboard when your order is ready.  Much better than the First Markham Place food court, where you have to stand around waiting and waiting for your order."}
{"text":"love this restaurant..Food is delicious at reasonable price..staff and services are very good...definitely best korean food i had tasted so far."}
{"text":"Compared to the other food places inside Galleria supermarket, this place is inexpensive and tasty. The soups are all under $10, comes with rice, a cup of tea and side dishes (sweet potatoes, Kimchi,  pickled radish). We usually get the seafood soon tofu and the pork bone soup.   The portions are great - very filling and cheap! The soon tofu is very tasty - love the soup and how the \"fishy\" taste is not overpowering. They give a good amount of tofu, zucchini and seafood mix (shrimps, squid). I also regularly order the pork bone soup. They put enough pork bone and potatoes. The soup is really tasty and full of flavour. The pork is tender.   The service is quick, simple to order out of their menu (there are a few items to choose from and most od them are soups). They're soups are really comforting especially during cold days. The soon tofu and pork bone soup are only $6. 99. Great price, quantity and qualitt for fast food!  They ring a bell when your order number is up - simple concept. And make sure that you clean after your table when you're done.   If you buy take out pork bone soup, you get a discounted price for 2 for $10 - so cheap!"}
{"text":"I believe it is a family own business.  very hard working staff.  very friend lady owner.   Good food and reasonable price meal."}
{"text":"Well, I came back recently based on the recent positive review of this place.  They have a 6.99 for special which includes 6 banchan/side dishes, purple rice, and the entree (either soft tofu stew of pork bone soup).    The banchan were well flavoured, the soft tofu stew had ample amount of tofu and the purple rice was cooked really well and they also gave a lot of that too. For $6.99 (anniversary special), it was a great deal.    In addition, it has been renovated, so the floors and tables look a lot nicer now and it's passable.  Great upgrade."}
{"text":"While it may not look like much being inside Galleria Supermarket, WOW delivers on both value, taste and quality.    We already had a light breakfast, but the aroma coming from this place was so great, I had to order something.  So I got your typical pork bone soup (asked for less spicy) and it came with some banchan (kimchi, seaweed and potato) and purple rice for $6.99 plus tax.    This PBS was so tasty and meaty and both me and my DC agreed that it was way better than the Owl in Mississauga.  Also, the broth was amazing too.  Not too salty and had a very homey feel. Loved it.  Verdict: awesome PBS and great value.  Give it a try if you are within 10 minutes drive."}
{"text":"Their $6.99 specials were awesome.  Soft tofu soup and pork bone soup was higher quality than many Korean restaurants in the area.  We also had the potato pancake and it was pretty good and inexpensive.  I saw what people were eating around us and the pork cutlet dish looked delicious.    The banchan was better than average and the decor was modern and clean for a Korean restaurant.  We will definitely go back there again.  Hard to beat a good Korean meal for $6.99 these days!     Not out of this world unforgettable Korean food I ever had, but solid good Korean food for very reasonable cost.  This may turn out to be my to go Korean restaurant in Mississauga."}
{"text":"I have only been here once for take out on the way downtown to see my sister along with some friends. We picked up GamJaTang hot pot(My favorite Korean Dish by far) and some fried pot stickers.   The pork bone soup was okay, not what I'm used to texture wise from Old Korea Town(College) /New korea town (Young/finch)  But the plus is they add so much extra in that other places don't, boiled pot stickers/rice cakes/veggies. And there was noticeably more meat then other locations. Plus the size was huge compared to others, 4 of us ate it for dinner and 1 more for lunch. They also have purple rice =D  Would like to go back and try out a few more items, but only if I'm in the area and don't want to trek up or down town.  Not a lot of parking but plazas next door have more.  Plus: Washrooms are located in a different area downstairs and it is kind of creepy getting to it, you have to go through a couple of hallways and doors :s  on a another plus the people who own and run this restaurant are really friendly :D"}
{"text":"Hi Yelplanders!  Benny K here again.  I honestly cant remember just how long I have been going to WOW for my Korean food fixes.  All I can say is that I love the place.  The prices here are just as good as Food Court across the street minus all the stinky vagrants begging for your money while you eat, and the lack of seating availability.  Dont even get me started on the washrooms.  OMG!!  Those of you who have been to the Food Court know exactly what I am talking about.     The husband and wife ownership duo are back in the same restaurant again.  Hubby left for a while to run the show at Galleria but he is back!!  They are the nicest people too.   About the food, I have tried many of their dishes over the years and truly have not been disappointed.  One of my personal faves is the Degi-Gogi (pork) Den-Jang Jigae (bean paste stew).   Bit spicy.   That with a side of Kimchi and rice.  Dayaam!  It is so flavorful.  Also remember that you have the right to ask for things higher or lower on the scovilles if you know what I mean.   Their in-house Kimchi compliments the mains so nicely.  UMMMMMM. The Kimchi is made with love!!  lol.  Not spicy. After many Moons (no pun) the owners decided to renovate the place.  Out with the old, in with the new.   Check out my updated pics to see the place now.  Big screen TVs and all.  Even have Nutrient Rice aka Purple Rice now for some of the more health conscious eaters.  So save yourself that drive to the Galleria.  There is plenty of free parking and quick access to Mississauga Transit.  It is just east of Hurontario on the north side of Dundas.  You gotta try it out Yelpers.  They even have at the table cooking options, and most, if not all of your Korean food faves!!!! Peace out Yelpers!"}
{"text":"I was craving for korean food during lunch time and didn't want to go far from my area so we decided to try this one out.  It's a small restaurant and the atmosphere is very casual and quiet. I was expecting it to be busy since it was a Saturday afternoon and everyone was grabbing lunch at nearby restaurants (traffic was horrible outside where this is located and it's hard to turn since they dont have a spacious parking lot).  Once settled in, I appreciate for the fact that the people there were very nice and very attentive. The food, however, was okay. I noticed they had a lot of hot pots is in their menu and I ordered the \"assorted seafood\" one since I wanted to try it out. It was okay, nothing too fancy since the ingredients were kept simple. I just wish it had more flavor to it.  The hot pots I believe range from 7-10$ I think... so if your in the mood for hot pots you can go there and try them out. So far, their hot pots are the least pricey I've come across since the one's I know cost a little bit more than theirs. And, they also serve other food too like bulgogi and such..which is quite nice too. Then again, I wish it had more flavor.  Their side dishes are good I must say. They give you a lot of serving on each dish and I like they don't cheap out.  Overall, I would recommend going here if your craving for Korean food to fill your tummy (if your around the area). This is the place to try out.   If you have high expectations on what Korean food SHOULD taste like, then skip out on this and make a trip downtown."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best Korean food in Mississauga, we've been coming here for years and the service is always great, food is consistently awesome and now the restaurant looks great. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Along the Dundas St. E, there are a few Korean restaurants. This is one of them. People coming from East (Dundas St. E.) or North (Jaguar Valley Dr. via Hurontario St.) will be easy to find this place and a plenty of parking space are right in front of the restaurant.   I have been here many times. The owner and his wife are very friendly. Besides they make good food, they always chat with the diners and constantly refill tea for the customers. I usually order the chicken soup, the pork-on-the-bone soup and the potato pancake. The price for all these food is extremely reasonable compared to the Owl. I want to highlight the side dishes here. They offer 6 side dishes which are more than the other Korean restaurants in Mississauga. Not just the amount, the taste for all of them are flavourful.  We ordered the chicken soup and the pork soup again. The soup base for the chicken soup is very clean and doesn't see much oil floating on the surface. Besides the chicken, we can also find the ginseng and the dates in the soup. The soup itself is very healthy. Plus, it also comes with the nutritious steamed rice, which boiled with red rice and other grains. Since the owners are celebrating the 16th anniversary, we find the special menu and some of the original dishes are on discounts. I ordered the pork soup, which is only $8.99. It comes with 3 big pieces of bones with lots of meat on them.   Along with the price we paid associated with the amount of the tasty food, and the service we had, I couldn't find any issue with this place."}
{"text":"Service: always friendly, and very hospitable  Food:  I have peace of mind that they don't use MSG.  Food is always delicious, and the side veggies are a great addition, especially the Kim chi.  Favourite dishes: soft tofu soup, spicy pork bone soup, and chicken with ginseng."}
{"text":"I visited the pop up stand in the OCAD student center, and the glass noodles have become my absolutely favourite. Tasty, solid portions, and cheap."}
{"text":"I was debating whether to give this place a 3 or a 4.  I had the spicy pork dish, glass noodles, my girlfriend got the tofu hot pot dish and cold noodle. She was not crazy about the taste compared to the other Korean place we usually go to.  My dish was alright, good portion of meat but the taste was not as good as the other Korean place we go to which is about 3 minutes away.  I am willing to go here again though to try their other dishes and because the service was good."}
{"text":"The bulgogi was pretty good. The service was a little slow at times but the quality of the food here is good. A little more expensive than a \"fast-food\" style place but noticeable differences in freshness and quality of the meat here. It's in the corner of a mini-mall on Dundas near Hurontario."}
{"text":"Just a tip as I've tried the PBS, Tofu Stew (both $6.99 special) & Spicy Beef Stew ($9.99).  And the best item/value was the PBS.  The Spicy Beef Stew came with pieces of bulgogi beef as opposed to the chunks of stewed beef and there was barely any meat.  Not worth the extra $3 deviating from the Specials.  Stick to Specials for as long as they're available!"}
{"text":"Entire experience is a FOUR. Meal is either hit or miss. Service was really good though. I just hope they would be open 24/7 so at least we would have another option other than owl."}
{"text":"Great value for your Korean classics, pork bone soup and etc. Everything is solid but I would not say anything pops out that gives this place a signature dish.  The appetizers are fresh and a nice touch.  This is one of my staple home cooked feeling Korean places in Mississauga.  You can't go wrong coming here."}
{"text":"Had the craving for Bibimbap and decided to try this place.   Service was fine and on point but then again I was the only customer so it should be expected. The person who took my order was pleasant and friendly.  In general the place looked clean, didn't go to the washroom so can't really tell about it's state.  In terms of the food. Well as I was scanning the menu I did not find the word \"Bibimbap\". Instead the closest clue i got to a bibimbap was called \"assorted vegetables with rice\" which had an option for a stone bowl. When I asked if they had any other variety like beef or pork I was informed there was beef in it already.  The portion of the bibimbap felt smaller compared to other places I have been. From the rice provided to the toppings itself. The taste...it wasn't bad but I guess underwhelming due to the small portions. I did get my satisfaction of the use of the stone bowl: sizzling effect on the rice. Hearing the sizzling and getting that crunchy texture of the rice was awesome!  Everyone keeps talking about the 6.99 special. Maybe next time I'll try it. For now I'll leave my rating as \"A-Ok\""}
{"text":"Try: Pork Bone soup  This is a gem inside the Galleria supermarket. Scalding hot soup going blub-blub-blub in a weighty stone bowl simply warms you heart and stomach no matter how cold it is outside.   Many of the soups here are good. 1) Pork Bone soup is a huge portion and the meat is tender. 2) Seafood Tofu soup is nice and spicy and perfectly comforting. I used to love the 3) Ginseng Chicken soup but haven't attempted it again since the name and picture on the board changed and it doesn't quite look the same.   This time I tried the 4) Beef Bone soup which is perhaps a bit misleading since there are no bones. It's simply beef slices in soup with glass noodles at the bottom. I personally found the soup blend and the beef slices tough so I did not enjoy the meal.   It appears that the potato side dish served recently are quite hard and dry, which is different from before... But hoping it's just a recent day inconsistency that'll be changed back soon enough.   I'll always come again for the convenience, the price, and the comfort the soups provide.   WYWH"}
{"text":"yes im a fan. i like the fact that i didn't have to ask for refills on my panch'an. all the little side dishes were great i especially liked the potatoes.   its a small mom n' pop korean joint near 10 and dundas that serves up some pretty decent gamjatang. it's about my third time here and have had no complaints.    fyi - If you're coming eastbound on dundas it is difficult to turn left on the small street cause of all the traffic.   -free wifi too"}
{"text":"Wow Korean Restaurant Inc. is really one of the fast food places inside the Galleria Supermarket.  Here you can get Soup in a Hot pot from $5.99. They do have the usual selections of soup and even Chicken Soup in Ginseng for $7.99.  Spicy Beef Soup in Hot Pot ($5.99) aka Hangover Soup - Not bad value for $5.99 which includes 3 Banchans (potato, kimchi and seaweed) - The soup is smallish... like half the hot pot - The broth itself not too spicy, lacking the kick... not going to help my hangover..  - The veggie selections inside the soup though quite interesting with turnips, bean sprouts and king mushrooms - The rice was just plain white rice... oh how I like my purple rice  I think I will definitely willing to pay a little more to have my Korean soup in other places... since there are a lot of Korean restaurants choice in the area.. However, Wow is still worth a try if you are in a rush... and have no time for a full service sit down meal!"}
{"text":"I didn't realized it went through a renovation until I saw it on a photo on Yelp. (I've tried it like 5 years ago.) So I went to check it out and surprisingly it was clean, spacious and welcoming. There's a small parking area in front of the place.   There are six small side dishes which were good and I love the variety. The nutritious rice came with some yam which was a nice touch to it. However, the rice could be more chewy. The down side to it was that my soybean soup looked darker than I'm used to at other restaurants, so it ended up too salty to my liking. It was mostly tofu, onions And zucchini pieces. The tofu was not the silky type which I love how it can melt in your mouth.   My partner got the pork bone soup and he was satisfied with his lunch. The potato could be cooked longer.   Verdict: yes I would go back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Clean environment; typical of the mom&pop Korean restaurants this side of M-town (Mississauga that is). Nothing to rave about, but hey, it's a clean place to eat.   Wouldn't necessarily come back here again, but wouldn't be against it.  Pros: - normal, average food - courteous service - comes with side dishes - a more extensive menu than other Korean restaurants in the area  Cons: - it's definitely more on the expensive side in comparison to the other restaurants   Overall, it's OK. Across the street is a dirtier international food court (Newin Centre), and they (currently) have three Korean food court stalls that sell better tasting Korean food for cheaper prices, but you sacrifice on the environment sake. Also, you only either get kimchi or pickled radish for side dishes.  Meh."}
{"text":"4 side dishes. 3 were gross. The potatoe one was good though. Not a good start to the night. Each dish was about $10 on average. It was not worth it. The tofu soup was decent. Pork rib soup was awful... bland and expensive. The beef slices soup was passable. Overall, I wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"very proper home cooked korean food.  they mainly do stews so if you're looking for the table cooking/kbbq then this isn't the place.  i'm korean and can verify that everything they serve is extremely proper!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Nice place to eat in. Quiet and peaceful with soothing music. The pork bone soup special for $6.99 is great! One of our faves."}
{"text":"This place is in my top 2 pick for Korean in Toronto.  Most people who know Korean food would be pleasantly surprised to find this gem of a restaurant in Sauga.    Food is prepared in a very authentic, healthy manner.   Their mixed-rice bowl is GOD send by it self.    I know most people like PBS for value & addictive taste but really, you can get that anywhere.  Spicy beef soup is the true classic here."}
