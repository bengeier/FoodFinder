{"text":"Best home made ravioli I've EVER had in my
Life! Me and my father came in for dinner having never heard of this amazing place before and we're in for the best food in years! The service was exceptional, the owner/manager came to talk to us and treated us like family, and the food was incredible. Adorable little BYOB hole in the wall place.... It was an amazing surprise to us to have had such a great meal! The meat balls were mouth-watering, the salad was incredible, the meat sauce was something not even my mother could have put together, and even being from the Big Apple, this was still the best Italian food I've had the pleasure of eating EVER! Thanks steve! Your the best!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at arpino last nite and let me tell you guys...it was terrific.that atmosphere was grand the food was fantastic and the service was impeccable..thank you arpino for a great dinning experience...you guys will be seeing. Us real soon."}
{"text":"Awsome little Italian restaurant tucked away in the court yard of Manor Oak Village. A true hidden gem. My husband and I went to celebrate the 31st anniversary of the day we met. The restaruant is small, quaint, and a BYOB. The waitresses were both very bubbly, attentive, and work well together. It was as if you had two waitresses at all times. The food was excellent...we started with an appetizer of Risotto balls stuffed with mozzarella and marinara sauce. Next, we had a delicious house salad that was so fresh topped with a light homemade Italian dressing. For our entrees, I had homemade pasta with crab in a light marinara sauce..yes homemade pasta, and my husband had Lobster with risotto. Hmmm...so good! We have been here several times before and it was equally as good. The moral of this review is that we have never been disappointed in the selection of the menu and the great tasting food. I can only say it is about time that I shared our experience with others looking for a good place to eat."}
{"text":"My husband and I have frequented here a couple times.   Each time our meals have been excellent.   I highly recommend the eggplant rollatini and penne vodka.  BYOB is an added bonus."}
{"text":"A small place that packed with big flavor.  They use locally homemade pasta this is excellent.  So much so that they sold me on buying it from the pasta maker for home use on holidays (a little too pricey to make it every week....DeCecco is just fine for daily use....).  Everything on the menu is excellent.  They have seasonal ravioli which are delicious.  And, their pesto has to be the best I ever tasted...fresh and vibrant.  Perfection!  But, I have to say that their eggplant rollatini is to die for.  Hands down one of the best things I ever tasted.  Next time I go, I am going to carry a sign that implores them to put Polenta on their menu.  I can only imagine how wonderful they would make it! Then they will have all of my favorites on their menu!   It's a BYOB and can get very crowded at dinner so they have to put a cap on how long you stay at your table--which could be a turn-off for some folks.   So, we solve that problem by going for lunches when we can!  The owner is a really nice guy and always makes the time to stop at the table to chat.   So glad we found this hidden gem!!!"}
{"text":"We have dined at Arpino many times since they opened. In general it is our kind of restaurant... Small, intimate, and BYOB with friendly owners who are engaged with their clientele.

Especially appealing is the outdoor area in the courtyard at Manor Oak shops. It is quiet and secluded with white lights strung on the trees giving it a magical atmosphere. 

The owners are very friendly and always make a point to stop by the table to say hello. 

We have tried many of the items on the menu with a general assessment of good but not really memorable.  Fortunately the outdoor atmosphere in the summer makes it worth going."}
{"text":"Charming little BYOB tucked away in Lebo."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd posting of this review, for some reason it was taken down.
On 25 Nov, 2017 on the recommendation of my brother I made reservations at this place for 6 O'clock. We arrived on time and were seated at a 4 top by the window. There was an empty 4 top beside us. Throughout dinner there were two tables open along the far wall that no one sat in. The food was okay, nothing spectacular, cooked right but way under seasoned. We did have a nice bottle of wine and it is BYOB so okay we were happy. 
We had been at our table for 80 minutes (7:20), after two appetizers we were still finishing our dinners and my wife and I still had  food on  our plates, finishing up our wine, when the waitress came over and said we would have to leave in 10 minutes because they needed our table for a party of 8. What? At 7:30 she returned with the check, I asked to speak to the manager. At the same time her co-worker was offering dessert to another table of 6 sitting directly in front of us. When my waitress returned she asked if I had made a reservation, I said \"yes\". She replied \"then they should have told you about the 90 minute rule\". Apparently this 90 minute rule only applied to my wife and I because no one else was being asked to go including a couple who walked in. I pointed out that we had not even been offered desert or coffee, and were now being asked to leave. At this point she offered to seat us at one of the still empty tables across the restaurant. I again asked to speak to the manager. He came out of the kitchen and stated he recognized me from my voice when I made the reservation. What no 90 minute rule? He offered  to move us and as I was going out the door offered free dessert. By that time, I was in no mood to stay. How the hostess, waitress and manager are not on the same page I have no idea. I will not be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I went with some friends here last night based on another friend's recommendation. The first thing you notice, before you even get inside, is how out-of-the-way and obscured the place is in its back-of-the-very-back-of-the-lot shopping center. You really do have to want to find it. 

The service was quick, the atmosphere was cozy, and our waiter (Regis) was very nice. The food was good, but not great. We ordered some rice balls with marinara sauce that were...good. Since rice isn't exactly the boldest tasting food, the sauce needed to stand out. It was - say it with me - good. Not nearly flavorful enough. I then ordered penne with hot sausage fra diavolo. The pasta was made from scratch, very nice, but it was a bit too heavy for my liking. The hot sausage was on the bland side, and the sauce, while (again) good, was too broth-like. 

A pleasant experience, and I wish them well, but unless the food improves it won't be a place I go to very often."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Italian food was mediocre and the average price was $27. The bill for 6 people with no desserts or appetizers was almost $300. Did I forget to mention that both the bread and the house salads were bland. Save your money and get a good cookbook and eat at home."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a recommendation for a special occasion. The seating area is small, but cozy. We made reservations based on the web site's recommendation. When we got there it was fairly empty. We were seated quickly and given our menus. The waitress working that evening was very nice. 

We were given some sliced bread (I'm guessing an Italian loaf) and olive oil to dip the bread in. It was OK, but nothing special. The bread wasn't warm, and both it and the olive oil were unseasoned in any way.

We did get the roman style riceballs for an appetizer. They were really good - although I can't say the risotto had a particular flavor to it, I think it was mostly the cheese at the center that made the dish. Either way, I'd order them again.

It took a little while for the waitress to come back and take our order. I got the carbonara with shrimp (an extra 4 dollars) and my husband got the penne with vodka sauce.

When the food came out I was disappointed to see that the extra 4 dollars I paid for shrimp only got me 4 shrimp. The carbonara was really salty,  maybe the combination of pecorino romano cheese and pancetta was too much for my palette. Either way, there was A LOT of pancetta in the dish, not much sauce to speak of, and the pancetta seemed  like it hadn't been cooked for very long before being put into the dish. It surprised me how much fat hadn't rendered out of it during the saute process. It didn't really have any color on it to indicate that it had carmelized or anything.

I've had carbonaras at other places, and have always really enjoyed them, so I was surprised to not care for this. There was only the pancetta and onions in the dish, and a bit of the sauce. Salty and boring.

My husband liked his penne okay, but we both agreed that we probably won't come back to this place."}
{"text":"Though the cuisine seemed pretty traditional Italian to me, I was suprised that Arpino had a modern, ladies-lunch decor and a fairly small dining room.

As with other reviewers, I was pleased with the attentive wait staff.  I certainly felt taken care of- at no point was I out of water or bread, and the waitress even arranged for a special menu request without charging me any extra, as I assumed would have happened.

Despite my love for the atmosphere, the food didn't quite make the grade.  My zucchini rollatini was serviceable, the side salad a nice touch, but the bread that came as an appetizer tasted like it came fresh from a bag and the pesto that I had ordered as a side just tasted kind of sad.

I wanted to like this place more, but it just wasn't happening for me."}
{"text":"There's really nothing to complain about here. This is a small place off the beaten path with awesome food. The staff is more that adequate and the prices are fair. Perfect lunch place."}
{"text":"Ratings based on 3 primary aspects: food, ambience and service.
Food is not exceptional...it's good italian food made with fresh ingedients...if its just for food, I will give a 3.5. I ordered the restaurant week special 3 course meal and my wife ordered from the menu: zucchini
Ambiance...very small place and everyone is loud...so not good or bad....it is what it is...I like that...my wife doesn't that much.
Service....Now here is where I believe things make a lot of difference......when serving dessert...they replaced the item on the pre-fixed menu with something else and didn't bother to tell us in advance...they assumed that we won't notice.....When we asked, the server apologized and told us that how chef wants it.....we didn't create a fuss about it....but selling by cheating your customer won't take you anywhere.....

Will avoid....IL Burloni is a much better Italian place in the same vicinity"}
{"text":"The service was wonderful-very attentive.  The calamari, a dish that is often a tell-tale sign for me, was perfect.  Loved the house salad and the eggplant rolletini."}
{"text":"I usually do not go out for Italian as it is unusual if its any better than I can prepare at home, especially spaghetti.  This place is an exception as they make their own pasta and you can tell everything is freshly prepared.  Fresh ingredients, BYOB, good service, and bistro like atmosphere makes this place a great choice."}
{"text":"Real Italian Food! This is a hidden gold mine! I came here with my family for an after Christmas dinner.  First off its BYOB so you can bring your favorite beverages, Second the menu is petite and has just enough without being overwhelming. The menu changes periodically which is perfect for keeping you interested to come back. The atmosphere is welcoming and small though a little loud if you get a couple of loud groups (we are a loud group sorry everyone). I started off with the beans and greens and risotto balls. Greens and beans were cooked perfectly, light and smooth. Risotto balls were large but not heavy, served in a bed of subtle marinara. I ordered eggplant stuffed with ricotta  served with marinara and it was amazing. The eggplant was sliced paper thin lightly breaded stuffed and fried but not greasy. I finished the evening with coffee and a delectable tiramisu. The tiramisu was not too strong and the dusting of cocoa powder was on point. I'm not a chocolate fan but when quality ingredients are used I can enjoy it. Our waitress was wonderful and new the menu and specials for the evening without hesitation. Can't wait to come back! A+ Posted pictures of our dinner enjoy!"}
{"text":"Warm atmosphere, wonderful food.  Had the special--pumpkin ravioli--appreciate the seasonal nod to autumn.  The staff is exceptional--genuinely welcome--as they are all over Italy!  BYOB w this home style food makes all the more like you are in someone's home.  Will go back!"}
{"text":"Less than average at best.  Found this restaurant only because we had stopped earlier at another business in the shopping center and decided to try it out.  The service is excruciatingly slow only because the kitchen is horridly slow and the restaurant wasn't even busy.

The bread was the first disappointment, soft Italian dough with unseasoned oil.  Yep, just a small dish of olive oil with nothing in it.

All of the dishes we ordered were bland and under seasoned.  The tomato bruschetta could hardly be called bruschetta at all.  2 cherry tomatoes on a crust of bread with oil and a sprinkle of cheese.  Wedding soup had dark meat chicken and a dark bitter tasting broth.

Linguine Pomodoro was saturated in oil and butter.  Chicken Parmesan was bland and the marinara sauce literally looked and tasted like Campbell s Tomato soup with some puree added, no joke!  Had requested a side order of Linguine, but the owner apparently drenched in sweat from his brow, would not accommodate us.

Do not waste your time, food like this is not worth the price they are charging.  Will not return again and would not recommend!!"}
{"text":"I had eaten here a number of times and decided to try their NY Strip steak (cost of $20.00).  The steak was super thin and unappetizing and I had to ask for a steak knife.  This is the kind of steak that you might expect in a steak salad, but you would not want to eat it by itself.  I was very disappointed in the quality of the steak which seemed to be very cheap.  The steak was served on a bare plate except for an arugula salad.  This is puzzling because the steak came with a side-salad before it was served -- so you get a \"double salad.\"  When I asked the waitress about the \"double salad\" she very matter-of-factly told me the arugula was merely a decoration.  Maybe I am guilty of assuming that Arpinos was good for more than just pasta.  I was impressed with their pasta generally but the steak appears to be something they haven't mastered. My comment would be take it off the menu.

Other comment: we had a larger party and made the reservation for 6:30 pm after requesting 6pm and being told that time wasn't available. At 6pm my wife received two phone calls from Arpino's saying \"Where are you?  We though you would be here at 6pm.\"  Their operation seems a bit disorganized."}
{"text":"I have been here several times since my first review. Although, my two gripes still remain... Limited seating area and small portions ( I am a big eater , so this only counts for me ) , The customer service and quality of the food is outstanding . Great place for a homemade Italian food and remember to bring your own bottles of wine ;)"}
{"text":"I was here for lunch.  To start: Brittany was my server and she made my dining experience quite enjoyable.  If I were eating Luma based solely on her service, she would receive all of the stars.   Brittany is very professional and very sweet.  I started with the Moroccan/Couscous soup.  It was flavorful.  I enjoyed it.  I wasnt overwhelmed, however I would certainly have it again.  The Grilled Romaine BLT was good after I had let it sit for a while.  I'm not a fan of salads that are ice cold(as if they were pre-made and placed in the refrigerator.) All the ingredients were a bit too chilled for my liking.  The salad turned out to be good.  I also had the Portobello Caprese Sandwich.  It was good.  Overall, I had an enjoyable experience.  Prices are a bit high for lunch, but other than that, all is good.  I would not consider Luma to be one of my favorite places, but I'll certainly be back for dinner."}
{"text":"Arpino Trattoria... What to say.

Living in the South Hills of Pittsburgh, I had never heard of it in my life.  I researched places close to my office, and thought, let's go!

It is in a strip mall kind of, very far off of the main road past the parking lot so extremely difficult to see (not likely to be stumbled upon).  Parking is free!

We came a friday afternoon for lunch, and it filled up.  We sat at one of the outdoor tables and it was absolutely lovely.  

BYOB BYOB BYOB BYOB!  (Personally, BYOB's are always a bonus. So good!)

SO -- BYOB!  

Every single dish that we had was phenomenal.  Our waiter was fine, he was quite slow, but we were in a slow mood which was nice.  I highly recommend this place for a lunch or a casual, long dinner.  

Extremely reasonable prices and quite generous portions, in addition to high quality ingredients.

Allow Arpino to bless you.  Bless yourself with your own beverages.  Bless us all."}
{"text":"First and foremost the food here is excellent. The place is quaint with only a few tables, so definitely make a reservation. They also accommodated our toddler very well, so kudos to them for that. I believe they are BYOB. My mother in-law and I split chicken parmesan and this delicious zucchini roll thing. The zucchini dinner was to die for. I will definitely be ordering that for myself when I go back. My husband had a spicy dish that was on special for the evening and he enjoyed it as well. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting for my birthday, looking for a relatively nice, but also relatively affordable, restaurant to celebrate, we stumbled upon this place (well, stumbled online, unless you were going to another of the businesses in the shopping center you probably wouldn't stumble upon it in real life). All I can say is that we were very satisfied with our meal, and extremely satisfied with the service. The dining room was full up, as it's fairly small, but there was immediate seating outside and they lit the heaters to keep us warm from the fall air. We had both our server and the hostess check up on us constantly and talking with us, they were both extremely friendly. We started off with the rice balls in marinara, which was quite tasty, and plated cutely. My friend got the pasta in vodka sauce, and I got a special which was chicken, potatoes, mushrooms and asparagus in a white wine cream sauce. My portion was pretty large, and I was able to take the remainders home. We had a Lemoncello gelato for dessert, and as it was our birthday they gave us free Lemoncello shots. All in all, it was a very enjoyable birthday dinner, especially for a place we just found an hour before hand. While the food was good, it was really the service that made this place stand out for me."}
{"text":"I like it.  I've only been once, but it was a good experience.

The wedding soup is excellent.  It is homemade, with big chunks of good stuff it in.  So don't miss it.

My house salad was a fresh, basic, house salad.  Good enough.

My penne vodka was really good.  The noodles were triangular in cross-section and were clearly home-made.  It's the chewy texture that makes them great.  The sauce was thick and adhered well to the pasta.  Very tasty!  The portion was on the small side, but it was the lunch portion, and was very reasonably priced.  Table bread is fresh, italian bread.

Overall, a great, little, restaurant.  I'll go again."}
{"text":"Overall experience was just okay on my first time dining here.  We came for dinner, and it caught me by surprise that there were no specials. The bread was a little disappointing, and I strongly suggest to Arpino:  please offer balsamic vinegar to go with the olive oil. Mediocre bread with plain olive oil is not great. Wine:  this place is BYOB, so we brought a bottle of red.  Corkage fee is reasonable at $5, but I found it strange that the person who popped the cork (not our waitress) did not even offer to pour it?? Just opened the bottle and set it back down on the table.  ??  I realize some patrons prefer to pour their own, but at least make an attempt/offer.  This is what we pay for when you charge the corkage fee (and when we figure out how much to tip you): open AND serve the wine.  I had a cup of wedding soup with my meal, and was not impressed, bland and had the tiniest pasta I have ever seen in this type of soup. My entree was okay, odd triangular-shaped  penne with eggplant and other vegetables  cut up in small squares, in a pink sauce.  Hmm. The sauce was pretty good and pasta was al dente. Big complaint about the Parmesan cheese though, which was never offered and I had to ask for it.  The waitress brought out a small bowl and set it down on the table; and it was basically Kraft grated Parmesan, the type that comes in the green canister at the supermarket.  If I am paying close to $100 for dinner (three people), and having to bring my own wine, there had better be higher quality than this - at an Italian reataurant.  The pre-grated cheese needs to go.  Either a higher quality shredded cheese or better yet, shredded fresh at the table onto your guest's entree is the way to go.  We shared tiramisu for dessert, which was really good, and I would (maybe) go back just for that."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here about a week ago. I was most impressed with the triangular shaped penne pasta and sauce and find the meatballs are some of the best I have every had. 

My wife enjoyed the antipasto with fresh \"real type\" mozzarella and salamis. We enjoyed the  atmosphere because it was a comfortable and romantic spot. I really like a place when the owner comes around and introduces himself, It is quite refreshing and not your typical Italian restaurant. We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I recently went to Arpino Trattoria on the recommendation from a friend from work.  I had just recently returned from a trip from Italy, and I can sincerely say that the food rivaled the food I ate while abroad.  The restaurant is small and intimate.  The chef came out to check how our meals were, and the other patrons seemed to be having a great night out.  Altogether, the entire experience was one I'd recommend to anyone!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I  had the pleasure of eating dinner here this past weekend with a group of six.  As I had never been to Arpino before, I was surprised by how the small the restaurant was.  Even though it was small it was still nicely lit and tastefully decorated.  Upon arriving at our reservation time we were told that our table was not yet ready and were sent to the bar next door with a note from the owner to give us free drinks.  It seemed odd but I enjoyed the fact that it was creative solution with a good result.

Upon returning to the restaurant I proceeded to order the Linguine Pescatore.  Prior to dinner they served a bread and oil which ended up being a good thing as our dinners would take about 45 minutes to get to our table after ordering.  We also received our side salads at some point early on in that time.  Whenever my dinner finally was served I thoroughly enjoyed it as the pasta was good with the  fair amount of seafood which paired nicely with the saltiness of the capers.  I also was able to taste the penne vodka which was exceptional.

The bottom line for me is that this was a nice little BYOB Italian restaurant that I would like to eat at again."}
{"text":"This is one of those times that I really wish I could give half stars. I've been to Arpino close to ten times. This review is based off of two recent visits following a 4 or 5 month hiatus. My husband and I joined another couple for dinner at Arpino during Pittsburgh winter restaurant week. I was excited to try the 3 course fixed price menu. No one else at the table decided to try the fixed menu and I wish I had not. The meal started with an appetizer which consisted of what I would describe as a thick cheese sticks with prosciutto. The prosciutto added a slight salty flavor to the dish which took basic cheese sticks to another level. The entree consisted of a chicken thigh/leg over rissotto with a rosemary cream sauce. The chicken was juicy and tender. The rissotto was the perfect texture but definitely lacked flavor. I missed the rosemary in the rosemary cream sauce. Overall, I was a little disappointed. I ended up stealing several of my husbands penne vodka off his plate to satisfy my desire for flavor. The 3 course meal ended with a cranberry walnut torta. This was the biggest disappointment of the meal. It honestly tasted like it was bought at the local giant eagle. Overall, I did not feel that this meal was worth the $30. My dining companions seemed to enjoy their meals much more. Despite my disappointing experience, I decided to give Arpino another chance when the recent snow storm prevented me from traveling across the city to where I had made reservations. So, I called Arpino and was able to get a reservation for 6 the day of, probably due to the snow. This time, I thought I would stick with what I know. I ordered the sicilian grilled strip steak. I found it odd that the steak does not come with a side. Just a thin 6oz steak and a small salad as an appetizer for $20. Seems a little steep to me. So, I added a side of penne vodka (my favorite menu item). The steak was a bit dry and small. Out of 6 ounces, I could eat maybe 4. The rest was pure fat. If my steak is only 6 ozs, I expect to be able to eat all of it. The penne vodka was delicious as always. The pasta is tender and cooked perfectly. Although, I can't confirm this, I imagine that the pasta is homemade seeing the penne is in the shape of a triangle not a tube. The table also ordered the cookies for dessert. We were presented with a nice selection of fresh, tasty Italian cookies. The perfect amount for a small treat to satisfy your sweet tooth at the end of the meal.  Overall, Arpino is a nice place. The service is good, the owner always walks around and introduces himself, there are casual tables outside in nice weather. But, the food is inconsistent. Some things are incredible while others are meh. If you're looking for good pasta and awesome vodka sauce, Arpino is the way to go. Otherwise it's hit or miss."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Arpino's. My husband & I ate there for the first time a couple weeks ago. We started with the rice balls appetizer. It was so so. Not bad but not really that good (rice seemed undercooked), not worth ordering a second time. A salad came with our entree order. The salad was basic but very good. I ordered the homemade cheese ravioli & my husband ordered the pesto pasta. I was not a fan of the ravioli. The marinara sauce was pretty basic, nothing special & the ravioli I thought was undercooked the shells were too tough. I think the ravioli shells should be soft almost melt in your mouth, these shells were tough almost too hard to cut with your fork. I took my leftovers home & when I reheated them the next day they were a little bit better & softer. So I think they have the right idea but just need to cook them longer. My husband on the other hand loved his pesto pasta. He was completely satisfied with it. 
I definitely want to give Arpino a second chance. There were a couple other entrees on the menu that sounded pretty good that I would like to try. It may have just of been an off night for the pasta I ordered. 
Just a heads up Arpino is a really small restaurant & reservations are recommended. I did not realize that beforehand. We just walked in & was lucky they had 1 open table. But next time will make reservations just in case, don't want to have to wait very long. 
Honestly if it wasn't for my husband's meal I would have given them 2 stars because I was not at all impressed with the items I ate but my husband really really liked his pesto pasta. So I'm gonna give them a second chance & order something different next time."}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed my experience here.  I was surprised there weren't more people there on a Friday night with how great the food was.  I was there with four other people and we all had a different dish, with zero complaints about the quality of food.  I had the eggplant, which was light and fresh and wonderful.  The side of pasta vodka was amazing.  Every sauce we had was fresh and full of flavor.  If you are coming and expecting huge portions ( like many American Italian restaurants) you won't get this here. But if you want to leave feeling comfortable and fully satisfied, then you are set!  The prices are more then I would normally spend for what I got but I know you are paying for quality!  I would recommend this place for a special occasion!   The server also was wonderful. I called ahead to order surprise appetizers for our table and asked them to do something special for the two birthdays we were celebrating. She enthusiastically obliged and brought us out two apps with candles and birthday wishes   It was perfect.  Loved it"}
{"text":"I wrote a review a month ago  ---- low and behold it never appeared, Why? 
Whatever this restaurant serves average at best food ---  Be very careful to observe the 2 hour limit ) even  if their are empty tables available. You are much better off  at Deblasios or the Olive garden   AT LEAST THEY ARE NICE TO YOU--- and actually the food is better."}
{"text":"As soon as my friends and I walked in, we could smell cigarette smoke. It was strong, pervasive, and ruined our meal. 

When the waiter asked me about the side salad that was included with my entree, he asked if I wanted blue cheese or Romano, implying the cheese was part of the salad. When I asked what the \"open food\" charge was on the check, I was told it was for the Romano. Meanwhile, my friends asked for Caesar salads instead of the side salad, but weren't told this meant paying an extra $7. My friend told the waiter that all these extra prices were misleading; he said we weren't the first to complain. Then why hasn't anything changed?

I ordered the penne vodka. The sauce was great, but the pasta was chewy/tough. The Italian bread was nothing special. 

My friends and I had the same assessment of the restaurant and agreed that we won't be back."}
{"text":"This hidden gem was one of the best Italian restaurants that I have experienced in Pittsburgh. From the service to the food, the experience was top notch. Our waitress was energetic, intelligent and responsive.  My girlfriend got the giglio gamberetto pomodoro which, just means giant tiger shrimp nestled in huge pasta twists with a light marinara.... Mmmmmm heaven. I got the tagliolini bolognese which... Again to the non Italian civilian means: narrow fettuccini noodles in the most delicious meat sauce you have ever tasted. Oh god I practically licked the bowl. I felt overly satisfied after indulging in this wonderful dinner. Will definitely come back again and again..."}
{"text":"Tried this place after a routine of always eating at all the same restaurants in the area and wanted to try something new. Food is horrible. My wife and I ordered our meals and as soon as we tasted it we looked at each other and realized it was the the worst Italian food we've ever eaten. The pasta was very doughy and bland. The sauce is also mundane. After we both took a bite and realized the taste, we told the waitress and all she did was ask if we wanted to take it with us. She said that because it was \"homemade\" pasta and it was fresh that might be why we didn't like it. Like we weren't used to it. 

First of all I am Italian and my family makes homemade pasta religiously. For her to treat me like the only Italian food I've ever eaten consisted of Chef Boy R Dee is insulting. Lastly, She didn't even tell a manager to come over and apologize or ask if we wanted anything else. In addition, she didn't even offer to take anything off the bill. I paid the bill and left. We will NEVER be back. I will stick with the rest of the tried and true places."}
{"text":"BEST vodka sauce ever, hands down. Biggest con, we got salads with our dinner and was asked what cheese we wanted so we answered.  When we got the bill we were charged $5 for the cheese and weren't even told prior to choosing a cheese that it was an up charge! I would have never gotten cheese if I had to pay $5 for it. The portion size is small and the prices are spiked.. We just ended up buying the vodka sauce and making it at home."}
{"text":"We celebrated my moms birthday at Arpino tonight and it was the first night for their new menu. Everything was FANTASTIC! The pasta is homemade, the sauce is drinkable, and everything was cooked perfectly. I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food & a friendly staff.  The pasta is all home made.  My wife had the ravioli and I had the Penna Fra Diavolo and we loved both.  The pricing is reasonable and portions are a good size."}
{"text":"I love coming to Arpino! Every dish I've ordered has been delicious! The features are always excellent and you won't leave disappointed. The rice balls, homemade pasta, greens and beans are all fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Let's start with...  they are trying.  I made a reservation for 7pm, 2 people.  My son decided to join us so I called and asked to add a third and they could not accommodate us.  No big deal since it was an hour before our reservation so I figured it was a long shot anyway.  But to my surprise they called me back 5 minutes later and told me they had a cancellation so they could take the three of us.  We ordered the stuffed hot peppers to start.  The sauce was good, the peppers were small but tasty.  My wife ordered the eggplant rollatini, son ordered the special cheese tortellini and I ordered the linguini with clam sauce.  The were all average at best.  A step above OG and the other Italian places that focus on volume not quality.  I am amazed this place finishes 3rd in the Pittsburgh magazine readers poll.  In summary, good not great, but they are trying."}
{"text":"Arpino's is a charming spot, I've dined there now three times and have consistently been impressed with the quality of the dishes - home made tastes better & it shows in their cooking! Call ahead for a reservation, the gracious hosts are sure to accommodate you. I haven't had a meal yet where Steve, the chef, doesn't come and personally ask how your meal was. (PS - It doesn't hurt that its BYOB too!)"}
{"text":"U know, I think I like it better for lunch.  An associate set up a little business lunch and brought some wine, too!  The restaurant was not very busy, so it was quiet.  A good place for a business lunch.  Service was great.

The lunch menu has a couple of apps., salads, homemade soup, and about 10 sandwiches some pasta and desert.  The Manhattan Calm Chowder was good.  The Italian Calamari PO-Boy was really good.  The calamari was lightly breaded, topped with arugula, some cherry tomato, and spicy aioli.  The calamari was cooked perfectly, tender and very tasty with the spicy aioli.  

We split a Arpino Cannoli which is two pizzelles with cannoli cream and chocolate sauce.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Above average food. But nothing exciting.  Atmosphere is what makes this place special.  

Tucked in a small plaza its a nice spot for a weekday eve dinner. Not sure how the weekend eve are 

Its byob but $5 per bottle corking fee. But they do have a wine chiller so can chill your bottle of wine by the time dinner arrives.  Also a pa wine and spirits store is in the next Plaza over.  

Meatball was bland. The sauce made up for it.  Also as others have said that they ask you about cheese add on options but do not mention if it's an upcharge. Didn't order any cheese toppings. So not sure if they charge or how much.  

Chicken cutlets was good and cooked just right seasoned steak was done as requested with some pink...  2 meals and $10 corking and meatball adder was $50 without tip."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, home-made ravioli, beans & greens were incredible.  Great Italian BYO spot!"}
{"text":"Super cozy place that I was pleased to see. There's not a lot of space but it's intimate and byob. Ordered the rice balls as an appetizer and they were pretty disappointing. The rice was undercooked and they had 1 small ball of cheese inside that wasn't even melted :( dinner came with salad which was good.  We ordered ravioli and a chicken dish with mushrooms & prosciutto, both were very good!  Big portions but nothing was spectacular, just good."}
