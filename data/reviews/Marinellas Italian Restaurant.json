{"text":"Absolutely my favourite place to eat in Toronto. Period. To start, the service has been nothing less than fantastic every single time. It is family run and very clear that this is their passion. Pretty much everything on the menu is made in house - from the bread, to the cured meats, to the pasta. I've been there 10 plus times now  and every time the food has been simply amazing. Just a few of the things I've had so far... -Salumeria Tasting: A must have! The cheeses are soooo good and a great way to start off your meal. -Chicken noodle soup: Sounds boring, but like everything else they do here, it was simply to die for. The best chicken noodle soup I have ever had. In fact, I was kind of sad when my bowl was empty -Calamari: never greasy always done just right -Pappardelle: My boyfriends go-to meal here. Delish. -Lobster risotto: Tried this last time and was not sorry! LIke everything else it was just perfect!   Basically, if you like Italian food and you live in the city and HAVENT gone here, its a damn shame. So, so, so good!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with my boyfriend, I used a groupon which was definitely necessary considering the prices of their food overall the dinner was good NOT great but good my boyfriend had the lamb three ways, loved the food but not the $49 price tag they don't tell you about when you order the special my pizza was good, but not hot enough and way over salted plus they charged me $2 extra because I wanted mushrooms instead of capers... It's not that was didn't have a good meal, but considering their prices we won't get returning and would rather check out other italian places on college street for the same food and service at a better deal."}
{"text":"We accidentally walked into this restaurant late last night. The atmosphere was so romantic. Everyone was so nice and attentive.  The waitress was so friendly and sweet - we didn't even notice when our water was refilled. THE FOOD WAS SUPERB! I love pasta and i have tried many pasta places in Toronto but nothing beats this in-house made fettuccine chicken alfredo. I am used to getting my food warm but everything was hot and freshly made. We are definitely coming back and highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance here. Amazing food and wine, but still a casual, family setting. Some of the best wait staff that I've had in a long time and Giovanni was such a gracious host to every table. I'd highly recommend this place for fantastic Italian food or just an amazing Toronto eatery."}
{"text":"My friend took me there for my birthday last night. We had calamari, sea bass with salads and crème brulee for dessert. The meal was delicious. Noah, our server, was very helpful and efficient, the chef came to say hello and we had a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Owner happily greeted us at the door and seated us promptly. I ordered the chicken alfredo and it was great. My other two friends also thoroughly enjoyed their meals. Their homemade sauce was delicious. Alex was also an amazing server. He was super friendly and kind. Definitely would recommend and definitely would return."}
{"text":"Ambiance: romantic with a casual touch  Service: welcoming environment, greeted by host telling us about the family restaurant, the chef of the night/his mom and her must try recipes  Must tries: Apps: shrimp marinella! - I want to bottle that sauce and take it home, pork belly, beets and bufala caprese salad, Entrée: seafood risotto, pappardelle giovanni"}
{"text":"This place was a pleasent surprise. My wife and I took my mother in law here for her birthday. The service was excellent and the food was good as good as the service if not better. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went in with couple friends for a casual dinner on a Sunday, and we chose this restaurant was just based on their yelp reviews!   We were all very satisfied with our meal!   we ordered:  Lobster risotto, sausage risotto, Fettucine Cabonara and the steak. They all taste amazingly delicious! risotto were very creamy, came with good size for the price. Presentation was nice (especially the lobster risotto). All the different sauces were just right, not too creamy, salty or sour. The texture of my fettucine was just right, slightly more on the al dente side but it was good, it came in a white base and i'm normally not a fan of white sauce, but this taste so delicious!  Honestly, I wanted to try everything on their menu now, and can't wait to go back already! It is that good!  They have a talapa special today, it comes in a whole fish with head and tail but boneless, I saw someone ordered that and it looks amazing too!  Some other people on another table ordered the lamb ragu with fettucine, it looks very nice too. I wish we have a few more people going today so we can all try different dishes!"}
{"text":"Great people.  Mamma who was in the kitchen created the best meal for me and my wife on Mother's Day"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience here. I haven't been to Italy to compare but this was the best Italian meal I've ever had. Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the food. We both got a pasta dish with their handmade in-house pastas. The flavors and ingredients were balanced perfectly. Also had the calamari and creme brûlée. Would recommend both."}
{"text":"I had my first visit just a couple days ago for my friend's birthday dinner. I looked up the restaurant to see its reputation. The three dollar sign had me taken back a bit (yes, I'm cheap but my excuse is that I'm a student with a part-time job). Their pdf menu online isn't accurate. Some of the items we not available, also the prices were less than what they actually were.   I have a bone to pick with who ever put the dress code at this restaurant as \"dressy\". The decor inside the restaurant is beautiful and elegant - so, it's understandable that you should dress up. As my group and I sat and looked around, we noticed the few people who were in the restaurant were dressed casually - t-shirts, cargo shorts, etc. Even the people coming in were being seated in their casual attire.  The a/c was broken or something. They sat us right in the front of the restaurant (assuming to make the place look busy) and I'm pretty sure on lookers saw us melting as we dined... Especially the guys in our party who were dressed in dress shirts and long pants in this disgusting July weather we've been having lately.  Other than that, service was good and the food was delicious. I ordered the primavera pizza which is huge for one person. The gnocci was delicious as was the bruschetta. Before your meal arrives they give you complimentary fresh bread with butter or balsamic and olive oil. Dessert took a while to come but it was delicious also. Would I come back again? Yes!... but in clothes a little more casual AFTER they fix the a/c."}
{"text":"The boy and I were just strolling around Little Italy, looking for a place to grab dessert when this place caught our eye!   For no reason at all other than it was convenient, we wandered in here.   The interior is lovely, it looks quite newly renovated, and judging from the new staff, may have had a makeover recently.   The man who welcomed us in was clearly the guy who ran the show. He was so friendly! Big Italian guy in a simple tshirt talking to people walking in, giving directions to staff, giving us recommendations on what to order......what a nice fella :) We immediately liked him.   Once we told him we wanted dessert, he informed us it was his mother in the back making the desserts! Aaaaawww.   We had:  1) Vanilla creme brûlée: really delicious and perfectly torched sugar crackly crust!   2) Tiramisu: served in a tall martini glass, this was also delicious. I took my time scooping out each bite through the different layers, and I could also really taste the booze and coffee! (A bit too boozy, but that's my personal taste.)   Overall, we loved the friendly atmosphere, sitting at the bar watching the game and enjoying how simple, laid-back and unpretentious the entire place was. We'd definitely come back to try the Italian mains!"}
{"text":"Decent food, nothing outstanding though. Decor is somewhat outdated. Service is good."}
{"text":"Hands down the best dining experience of my life!  Thank you to John (our server) and his family for the exquisite italian cuisine they brought my partner and I on our short stay in Toronto.  The meal was flawless and service exceptional. Loved getting the back story about a true family business/restaurant and all of the homemade specialities which made the experience one of a kind.  Five stars!"}
{"text":"My husband just threw me a surprise party for my 30th there and the servers were great with our large group of 25! Very patient and accommodating!  In our entire group, we probably ordered everything on the menu and everyone was raving about the food! Very good collection of wine on the menu. We are going again for valentine's day so I can properly try the food..since I was so overwhelmed on my birthday!  :)"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times and each time I have the same amazing experience as the last! If you are looking for authentic Italian, this is definitely the place to go. The price is a little bit more than other restaurants on the college street strip but the quality of the food certainly is worth it!   The restaurant prepares every single dish fresh, including the pasta! They have homemade cured meats and cheeses for you to choose from, as well as daily specials."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants on College!  I usually get the food to go, so I can enjoy it at home.  Even though I live only a few minutes away, the food is still really delicious by the time I get home.  The few times that I have dined there, the service was lovely.  The son, I can't remember his name, is friendly and accommodating and is so proud his mama's cooking!  My favourite dish is the seafood linguine. I don't know what they put in their marinella sauce, but I can't get enough of it!  I'm a huge fan of homemade pastas and they do it spot on.  The portions are filling enough, leaving you with just enough room for dessert.   I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our date night and the ambience was great.  We were greeted and seated immediately by John and our server George. Both very charming and attentive throughout the evening. So now the food...OMG!!!! Amazing!!! The fried calamari is the best I've ever had & the pasta special was just divine.  I had the creme brulee for my dessert and wanted another one! Everyone that came by our table was courteous and professional.   Service & food deserves the five star rating. Definitely will be going back! Maybe our new favourite spot!"}
{"text":"This family owned restaurant is one of the finest Italian meals we have ever had.   both the food and service were perfect.  Everything is homemade.   And everything is every bit as good as all the  reviews  you will read here.  Finish with the chocolate cake.  To die for!  Make a reservation"}
{"text":"Getting out of the cab at this address, you kinda get this unsure feeling - the curb appeal leaves you a little worried. Basically IMO the entrance looks like you could be walking into a hair salon.   That's where it ends, you breathe a sigh of relief once you're inside and all is well. The Italian flavour permeates the place, the Risotto was awesome (I'm a risotto freak) as was George, our server. Great experience all around. I recommend."}
{"text":"NEVER GET SEATED!!! WAIT FOR 3 HOURS!!!  Me and my boyfriend was trying to get a table around 7pm and the guy outside said they have no space right now if we want we can come back at 8:30, me and my boyfriend agreed and booked our name for 8:30. so we came back at the time because I really wanna try their seafood risotto. The guy told us he was surprised that they still had no space blablabla and told us to wait for another half hour, I gave him my number and asked he to call me immediately when table is available. We were sooooo hungry and cold, me and my boyfriend waited across the street for a bit and saw people walking out like they were just finished!!! And He just dont let us in!!!! We waited till 9:20 he never called me or anything. we end up having instant noodle at home right now.  I just dunt understand why he dont let us in, like 3 hours!!!! and he said they have no reservation after 8:30. Until close!!!! no space?? guess he just dont want us in. but why????It feels like we are on some black list or something but it was our first time ever! he can just told us sorry that we cant have your guys tonight so we can choose to have sth else not wasted all night waited for nothing!!!!!  This is just soooooooo unforgivable."}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp and I husband and I went this evening. I called around 1pm and made a reservation for two at 7pm, the guy on the phone sounded hesitant about being about to fit us in but took the reservation. We showed up on time and the place looked about 2/3rds full. Good thing I made a reservation because the rest of the place was already set up for reservations so they turned groups away.   To start my husband ordered the Beet and Bufala Caprese salad ($12) and I ordered the Pork Belly starter ($12). The salad was nice but the pork belly on rapini was amazing, the pork was so flavourful and nice and crispy. For ours mains my husband ordered the Fettuccine Carbonara ($22) and I ordered the Seafood Linguine ($22). My husband loved his Fettuccine Carbonara, I didn't really pay attention to what was in it. My Seafood Linguine was fabulous, the noodles were perfectly cooked, and it had 3 pieces of shrimp, 2 mussels, a piece of king crab, and 1/2 a lobster tail; the sauce was the perfect balance of flavours.   Throughout the meal my husband got 2 spicy caesars ($8) and a pint ($8). The caesars actually had pieces of chili peppers; he really enjoyed the drinks. For dessert I got the tuxedo cake ($9) and my husband got the tiramusi ($9). The tuxedo cake was not very good but the tiramusi was so good. A traditional tiramusi.   A fabulous meal, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We are always on College St. Such a great vibe! We stumbled upon this restaurant that we never noticed in all our years going there. The patio looked pretty neat. So we said lets try it out. We were greeted by a hostess who mentionned to us that it is a long wait because all their foods are made fresh on the spot. I was like yes of course no worries.  Well this was a great dinner experience. We started with the fried calamari. Unbelievable crispy yet tender. I had the seafood risotto and my husband had pasta carbonera. Every bite was like heaven. The portion sizes were perfect so you dont have that overstuffed and bloated feeling. This place gets 5 stars. The waiter was funny, witty and personable. It was a great night cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We get the best service every time we come here whether it's for a sit down meal or takeout! They are the friendliest people! The food is so delicious and very authentic. I usually start with a salad and always order the penne arrabbiata because it is the best tasting thing ever! I would recommend this place to any and everyone!!"}
{"text":"Four of us went for dinner there on a Wednesday night and I can not say enough great things about the food. The lobster Risotto was phenomenal, the Caneloni and the Lamb on special were also fantastic. There was however, nothing special about the bruschetta, it was well made but bland. We also ordered the Sopressata appetizer made in house and it was fantastic. Their house red wine, a Montepulciano, was delicious and a great selection. The dessert however left much to be desired for and that is why I am not giving this place 5 starts. The chocolate cake was served too cold, as in just dug out of the fridge cold, additionally, it was too sweet despite the waiters' insistence that it was not going to be. I also ordered an Espresso Corretto which was disappointing. I expected more from the coffee at such a fine Italian place. The service was fantastic and the staff very friendly. This is definitely my new go to spot for Italian food.  Be carefuller though, it is expensive although on par with other restaurants at its level."}
{"text":"I was craving Italian food, me and my husband went here as the reviews on Yelp were very good.   OMG best Italian i have had. I can not wait to go back.   The guy at the bar was great. Our waitress was very informative and attentive.   I got the lobster seafood pasta dish ( Can not remember the exact name on menu). the portion size was great. Very impressed with the place."}
{"text":"Dropped in at 5:30pm on Saturday with a party of 5. We had one hour to eat and were happily hurried into a great booth by our server. George was fantastic! He was thorough, made very thoughtful recommendations and was knowledgeable about all menu items.  We ordered the veal parm, the branzino fish of the day, the papardelle and the seafood linguine. Everything was excellent. Pastas are homemade, and though we didn't try any of the meats or cheeses - those apparently are made in house as well!   Don't let the sign fool you - this might be the best moderately priced italian in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Talk about authentic , this place has it all! When I had dinner here, for the first time, I met John who treated us like family. Great sauce, great service, and one of the best meals I've had in Toronto! If you want a real Italian meal, you must go see for yourself! Top notch!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!! We were waiting quite a while for our table which we reserved which was a little irritating and I found the place a bit pretentious but I can't complain about the food which was amazing! The lobster risotto is great!!   Definitely a great place to eat and the staff were awesome"}
{"text":"traveled to toronto  with my wife and  had dinner this evening. i never ever minded paying  for a dinner up until tonight we .started out with roasted peppers in olive oil - tasteless but the worst part was the portion that amounted to 4 table spoons $ 8.00 - our entree was seafood fettachini $31.00 2 shrimp - 3 mussels - and what looked to be some lobster meat  - wtf give me a break awful experience!!"}
{"text":"Great meal, lovely ambiance, passionate wait staff.  Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"One of the very best dining experiences we have ever had! And we have eaten at many an italian restaurant in in Manhattan and San Francisco! We were visiting Toronto from the US happened upon Marinellas on a Thursday night. We got a warm, personal introduction from the owner, who explained the wide array of Calabrese-style dishes prepared on-site by his mama. We came back on Saturday! Best red sauce and meatballs ever!   Fresh, colorful, flavorful ingredients! Warm and friendly staff. You gotta go here if living in or visiting Toronto!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service, a regular favorite of mine on College. Easily the best Italian food in Little Italy. Family-run - try the homemade Marinella sauce and cured meats. A must for anyone looking for a spectacular meal while in Little Italy!"}
{"text":"So delicious!!! Such great service and attention to detail. Recommend the lobster pasta, veal, any pasta really, mushroom pizza and calamari."}
{"text":"Some background: I always bought $0.99 no-name pasta in a 900g bag, paired it with a jar of Ragu sauce and thought that was Italian food. So, basically, not a seasoned consumer of Italian food.  But oh my god. My world was rocked when I came to Marinellas.  The bread used for the bruschetta was SO FRESH. I normally never order bruschetta because most places just sloppily put canned diced tomatoes on day-old bread and call it day, but Marinella's uses fresh, baked-hours-ago bread, freshly diced tomatoes, and fresh everything.  Came here for New Year's Eve and it was such a wonderful experience. Our server was so lovely and didn't rush us out even though there was a packed guestlist. The food and dessert was to die for. Many of the pastas (or all) are made in-house and daily.  I didn't take a picture of my pasta because I ate it up so fast. My dining companion got a surf and turf plate, pictured here. Next time I want to try their risotto.  If you want to try Marinella, BOOK AHEAD. They are popular because they do pasta right!"}
{"text":"Came here due to Yelp review and I have to say their seafood risotto is absolutely amazing! (Does take a while to prepare as per their menu), However, we were kind of upset that another table got their food way before us even though they came after us, despite similar orders. Not much wine selection on whites. Atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Service was slow but friendly. Nice ambiance. Shared lobster risotto and penne a la vodka both were delicious."}
{"text":"Accidentally found this place and it is one of Toronto's treasures. Great food, service, drinks and ambiance. Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant! This is my all time favourite restaurant for Italian food. I have brought so many friends and family members here and have recommended it to numerous people. My coworker who grew up in the area and still resides in Little Italy planned a night out years ago and ever since I have been hooked. I believe it is a family run business. The mom makes all of the pasta noodles from scratch. They even cure their own meats. I always ordered the lobster risotto which is phenomenal. They cook it in their house special sauce. The prices are reasonable for the quality you receive. I highly recommend Marinella's for quality Italian food."}
{"text":"Came here last week on a Friday night for my anniversary. The food quality and service was top notch.   The server was really nice and helpful, explained all the items thoroughly and let us know that some of the main courses take longer to make.   We had the salumeria tasting: basically a charcuterie board with salamis and cheeses, olives, and a plate of pickled veggies. This was good. I will admit I'm not a charcuterie connoisseur but I enjoyed and was glad to have something to munch on before the main dishes.   Lobster risotto: This dish was my favourite. Me and my boyfriend were pretty much scraping the plate for every last grain of risotto and sauce.   Side Meatballs: meatballs were delicious as well. They are veal and pork. It comes in one of their pasta dishes as well, but I'm not much of a spaghetti in tomato sauce kind of person, so it was nice to be able to sample the meatballs  Fettucine carbonara: I think this may be the first time I've tried handmade pasta. It was good though the sauce was a little thin. I was expecting the sauce to be slightly thicker and creamier to compliment the heartier texture of the pasta.  We also had a plate of asparagus. Gotta get those veggies in. Haha. They were cooked to perfect texture and flavour.  Overall I would say its definitely worth it just to have that risotto. We were thinking about getting another plate of it but we were too stuffed. The only downside is the wait for the food so be prepared to eat some of their bread or order some appetizers."}
{"text":"Me and some friends found this place almost by accident while walking along College St with an eye out for a place with a patio this past evening.  We sat outside, the only problem being that it was too dark to read the menus without the the aid of our phone's LED flashlights. This place is a bit more expensive than others in the area, with a bill of $175 (+tip) for dinner for 4 including desert. Not horrible for the type of restaurant and its ambiance.   The food took longer than usual to come out, but as they make almost everything in house including the bread, etc - was not horrible. Gave us more time to talk business.  I had the daily special pasta, which was well done. I wish the portion was larger, but at 265 lbs, I eat a lot. The tankhosue brand beer they had on tap was good. The latte was tasty, but the home made creme brulee stole the show! I am going back to this place, if not just for the creme brulee!"}
{"text":"At first, the exterior makes it seem like the restaurant is mediocre, but once you enter, it's totally different. The interior is very nicely resigned; very elegant with dim lights and candles lit on the tables. The staff were very friendly and attentive. The server would always pour us more water as needed.  The restaurant is run by a mother and son as the head chef, as we were told by our server. All of the pastas are made in house except for the penne that is imported from Italy. We ordered the special with the Lamb, Spaghetti and Rappini and the Seafood Risotto. The risottos are very popular and usually take around 40 minutes.   The seafood on the seafood risotto was fresh and the risotto was very well flavoured. The special with the lamb was well cooked and the meat was tender. The spaghetti was also pretty tasty with the tomato sauce.   For dessert, we ordered the ricotta cheesecake. It has a citrus flavour to it and has some berry sauce. The texture was very dense, much more dense than a New York style cheesecake. However, it didn't feel as heavy.   Overall, this is a great place for a romantic date, or even a special gathering with friends."}
{"text":"Amazing family owned restaurant. My son is very very picky and said this placed had the best Italian food he has ever had. I ordered the risotto and I don't think I ever will have risotto like this again. Everything from the appetizers to the salads to the lunch - dinner menu, is fresh and wonderful. I definitely will be coming back here over and over.  You feel so full and happy after finishing your meals."}
{"text":"Fabulous! Homemade - pastas, curd meats and desserts. Risottos amazing - time taken to do them right. Lobster risotto - wow I'm still dreaming about it. The veal chop - get chefs recommendation!! Seafood pasta - perfect! Be prepared to be spoiled - the Marinella sauce is the best I've ever tasted anywhere! Make sure you get enough bread to mop it up. Deserts - get the \"birthday cake\" and Tiramisu. A family run restaurant - where attention to detail has taken years to perfect, from the kitchen to the bar. It is unpretentious and welcoming. Bravo! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in town! Call ahead for reservations! The sample platter of artesianal meats and cheeses was simple and rssty. The risotto was well worth the wait. The caprese could have used more mozzarella and badil. The pasta was also dented  Our waiter was very attentive and our drinks were always flowing the lemon cake was out if this world but the chocolate cake was alright ."}
{"text":"As a huge fan of Italian cuisine, I'm always looking to explore restaurants during my travels. While in Toronto, I looked up on Yelp for highly rated restaurants and came across Marinella. The 4.5 rate plus good price got me intrigued so I had to check it out.   I was welcomed to the small and cozy Marinella by the owner John who said \"his mom and brother would be cooking dinner for me\". While dining there, I noticed John is a hands on owner, who takes a lot of pride not only on the food he's serving but also on the quality of service. I call it a labor of love.  I followed John's suggestion and ordered the beet salad as a starter. The dressing was absolutely delicious! But my evening was only starting. When I was served the lobster risotto I was impressed: it was cooked to perfection! Everything tasted fresh and homemade. The Chianti was a perfect combination for my entree. The risottos are made as you order so it takes a bit of time but there's no better way to guarantee the freshness. To finish my lovely evening, I had the best creme brulee ever followed by a shot of limoncello.   2 days after my first experience I had to go back. Had the calamari which was the best I've ever had and a replay of the lobster risotto. Now I want to taste very single dish! Can't wait to come back to Toronto and visit this wonderful family restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent! We had reservations for six and sat at the chefs table. It was a small family owned and run place that takes great pride in treating their customers like family! Momma and son were in the kitchen making handmade pasta and cured meats from scratch... And our charming host (the baby brother) Giovanni explained the whole menu until we ordered nearly one of everything!  Seriously though, the beet salad was amazing, I wanted to marry the lobster risotto and the handmade pasta and lamb were greatness!  I asked to be adopted to the family so I could eat like this everyday!   Next time I'm in town, I'll be sure to come back for more!"}
{"text":"Went here because of the Yelp reviews and overall had a decent experience here.   They were limited in what they could make for my diet because most of their pasta uses eggs and their sauces were all made with onions and garlic.  Still they accommodated me.  The restaurant is very busy but service was still quite good."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Lovely room, attentive service, reasonable prices and superb pasta.  I really like it here and will be sure to come again."}
{"text":"Nothing beats feeling like family!  From the moment you come in they make you feel special. We had the most amazing homemade pasta dishes and very topped off with dessert and liquors. Make a date for this place, you'll not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere here and the servers were attentive. The food was good but can't say it was great. We were a party of 8. My Husband had the Osso bucco, it was great, as was the risotto that came with it. I had the seafood risotto.  I have to say I have never seen or tasted 3 such tiny, overdone mussels, the 1/2 lobster tail was again overdone so a bit tough and not very generous, the tiny bit of crab body yielded a small bite of crab and the shrimp were toughish as they were overdone as well. The risotto itself was wonderful but I cringed at how the seafood was treated. Another friend had the pappardelle, tasty but barely warm. Another friend ordered the gluten free pasta & wanted plain tomato sauce but got arrabbatia, & it was too spicy for her.  I feel this place has lots of potential but need to really pay attention to the food details."}
{"text":"Out of all the Italian restaurants I've been to in Toronto, this was hands-down the best. I ordered the Fettuccine Chicken Alfredo and it tasted the exact same as 2 of my other favourite spots, none of which are in Canda - The Grand Lux Cafe (Vegas) and Mama Maria's (Brooklyn, NY). This was exactly like those and I instantly fell in love with this place.  I'm keen on coming back and trying something else, but when you have your go-to, it's tough. Definitely going to return!  I'd recommend booking a table in advance, as I did that when I went on Valentines Day. I read some reviews about waiting for a table - just call to book in case."}
{"text":"Food was a decent size and delicious. Definitely recommend giving this one a try if you like Italian. It's a little pricey but the ingredients are all fresh, organic and grass fed meats. Meats, bread, pasta and cheese are made in house. The manager was very friendly came to us multiple times chatting about his menu, ingredients and asking if we were enjoying ourselves."}
{"text":"Great homemade pasta!  Really enjoyed the family feel and the stories. The non-pasta options were very limited, but I'd recommend the house cured salumis.  Pasta itself was cooked perfectly (al dente) and sauce was very flavourful. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Impeccable staff and the best Italian cuisine I've ever had. My boyfriend has the surf and turf and I had the seafood ravioli. The pasta is made there, by their mother! Best calamari I've ever had and the dessert didn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"We came here on a busy Saturday night and sat at the bar. All of the staff were very helpful and courteous. The owner was also very friendly and checked in on the quality of the food and our dining experience. They told us their mother is the chef and was cooking in the back.  We had the funghi pizza which had mushrooms grown in their own garden. Very delicious. We also got the osso buco veal dish with bone marrow. The flavors were good but the meat a bit chewy. Finally, we got the fettuccine carbonara which was perfect with handmade noodles and al dente.  Overall, great family run restaurant experience."}
{"text":"I loved Toronto and loved Marinella's. This was a very authentic Italian restaurant in little Italy. The staff was friendly and the seafood pasta, salume and spumoni were sensational. The well selected Italian wines only added to the experience. Even the house wines were superb."}
{"text":"This isn't Italian it's cafeteria food warmed in the back. First off, ordered \"seafood pasta\" got 3 tinny shrimp I mean tinny the kind you get in a can, 1 very small clam which turned out to be a mussel. I didn't know seafood came in such small pieces? Maybe it's restaurant size to fit the big plates... I don't think the food is cooked here, I think they buy prepared food from catering companies that do just that and warm it in a convection oven. Most restaurants do just that.  Most folks don't know that. All this place has going for it? Location, location. Expensive, but not value for your $$$$. I don't mind paying for food I enjoy, I mind spending a small fortune on food I can get at the frozen section of Costco.  Most folks in Toront think frozen wings fried in oil lathered with BBQ sauce (made of mostly sugar) is gourmet food? It's sad! Please don't use this posting as a negative review, you should go. There is another  place as (Terroni) on queen st for \"southern Italian \" food where they think we're stupid and don't know what folks eat in southern Italy?"}
{"text":"It was good, however for the price/value not great. Service was very good, probably the best part of the meal. I was expecting homemade bread, nope, standard bun nothing special. I ordered the seafood pasta and as much as I appreciate the rustic nature of homemade pasta I felt it was a little too thick and chewy. That just my personal preference I guess. The Marinella sauce was delicious probably because it had whipping cream in it. My wife had the lobster risotto which was tasty but had a pretty small amount of lobster meat.  Calamari was very tender but it sat in a pool of grease which I assume is from frying with the wrong oil temp. Where they really fell short was with their pizza which I brought home for my son. It was almost inedible, not sure if the crust was even cooked but it was very doughy and overall quite amateur. $163 for all of this including 20% tip and a half litre of wine. Way, way, way better options in Vaughan."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible place that makes you feel like you are part of the family. The food is amazing! The homemade pasta, mama's secret sauce, housemade salame etc etc. I could seriously go on & on. Just go!!"}
{"text":"Anything that comes with the \"Marinella Sauce\" is ridiculously amazingly delicious!!! Love this place, never disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here and it is amazing. Family owned/run business with mom and son working as chefs.   Looks beautiful, great atmosphere, music was nice and a good volume.  We had: Complimentary bread Baby pickles Veal parmigiana Chicken Alfredo with Marinella sauce  Everything was delicious, service was great, and reasonably priced. Our meal plus a beer and a glass of wine was $75.   Would definitely eat here again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it"}
{"text":"The food was amazing the service was great and everything was really nice!!   The pastas were fresh made in house and you could really taste the difference all the pasta dishes were excellent one of the best pastas I think I've had in quite a while!   For being a family run restaurant with the mother and son as the head chef and everything made after it has been ordered,  the prices are quite nice!   I was sad that the tiramisu finished before we were able to order it.  My husband got the Primavera pizza and I got the chicken Alfredo pasta. We thoroughly enjoyed both items and will definitely be back.   We also shared the rice stuffed with cheese croquettes  and the calamari was really crispy and fresh. To end my friends got the crème brûlée and we got the chocolate cake. The desserts were so-so but everything else was amazing!"}
{"text":"Marinellas. This is an unpretentious family run Italian restaurant with locally sourced ingredients. They even cure their prosciutto in house. The vibe of the restaurant is very professional, and you also get a sense of closeness that only a family-owned business can give. From the moment you call in until the moment you leave, it's a very enjoyable and comfortable experience. 5 Stars for venue and service.   The food is good. Each plate is very well crafted. You can see the kitchen's commitment to each dish. Marinellas' Lobster Risotto gets full marks for flavor and execution. As a fan though, I would love to see this kitchen push their quality even further. A few elements of flavor fell slightly short in their pasta dishes. Otherwise, it was a very solid service.   A great restaurant for family/friends or a night out with work colleagues."}
{"text":"Love the freshly made pasta. Really high quality service and nice, relaxing atmosphere"}
{"text":"Food is really good but very small portions & wait staff was great to everyone else but us, had a young guy who seem to forget about us though the other waitresses were very attentive."}
{"text":"I've having trouble coming up with any reason to not give this place 5 stars. I can confidently say this is the best italian food I've had in Little Italy, maybe even Toronto on the whole. But not only was the food really tasty, the service was on point, the atmosphere is warm and friendly, and even the music (lounge covers of familiar songs) kept sucking me in.  It's also hard to not appreciate these family restaurants (mother and son in the kitchen while the other son meets and greets customers on arrival). You can see the pride they put into their work.   After 2 apps, 2 mains (one of which was $42), a bottle of wine + a glass, and piece of cake for dessert, we were properly wined and dined for around $170 post tax pre tip. My only regret was that I didn't try a pizza. I watched a few of those come out of the kitchen and they looked really tasty which made me wish we got one of those instead of the bruschetta (which I'm generally not a fan of, nothing against this place specifically)."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks on the weekend. The patio enticed me...its on a corner, so there is a nice view of the street. But its also a bit quiet compared to the other restaurants along the street, making it more a relaxed/upscale environment. Amongst us, we tried the Riesling, beer and a cappuccino martini. All were great. We shared a 'dessert trio' - biscotti, creme brule and lemon cupcake. It was great, but the creme brule stole the show. My advice is to skip the trio and just get a larger sized serving of the brule :). They also had cake, which looked extremely yummy and I will be making a trip back for.   Its slightly on the higher priced size ($11 glass of wine vs $8-9 at most places) but worth it for the nice ambience and service."}
{"text":"I stopped by Marinellas for dinner while I was at the Taste of Italy festival recently. I have never heard of them before, and I must say that I was quite impressed by my experience there. We sat outside on their patio, and enjoyed some sunshine and people-watching while we waited for our food.  The waitress told us that Marinellas is a family-owned restaurant, with the family members working in the kitchen and managing the food service. It's definitely an authentic Italian restaurant! Best of all, all of their pastas are handmade!  I ordered the Penne Alla Vodka, which has prosciutto and mushrooms, cooked in a delicious vodka-infused tomato sauce. The penne was cooked just right, not too soggy or too dry. I also tried some of their Fettucine Chicken Alfredo, which was very tasty as well. The handmade element definitely made their pastas extra delicious!"}
{"text":"Took the babe here for his birthday dinner and we had an awesome time.  Atmosphere was very romantic - think dimly lit and nice ambiance. Amazing wine selection - we ordered a bottle and it was lovely.  Food was so so delicious. The homemade pasta was absolutely incredible and my man loved his main dish too. Can't wait for another occasion to come back and visit."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in Toronto! Seafood fettuccine and calimari were so fresh and tasty Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant as we had a caesar salad and bruschetta to start. They were both very tasty and fresh. We had some nice drinks as well but a bit on the pricey side. For the main dish we both had the chicken fettuccine Alfredo and it was heaven. We couldn't finish it so we had it to go and regretful didn't try their homemade desserts. :( All in all a wonderful restaurant with excellent service too."}
{"text":"My favourite Italian Restaurant in Little Italy!!! Took a couple of my friends from out of town and they also loved it. The food was so delicious. They have amazing wine selection. We had 2 bottles lol and the service is impeccable. Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Wow wow et wow. C'est un restaurant qui vaut le détour. Typiquement italien familial, l'accueil et le service sont irréprochables. J'ai pris des pâtes avec la fameuse sauce Marinella, c'était extraordinaire. Les prix sont corrects aussi.  Je vous recommande fortement!"}
{"text":"Family restaurant with good ambience - I had a fettuccine carbonara. Handmade pasta was overcooked. No porched egg on top. A little but disappointed. Give two stars as my friend had risotto and they liked it."}
{"text":"Cozy restaurant which is perfect for a date night. The service was excellent. We ordered a bottle of wine, and our server ensured that our glasses were filled including our water. For appetizer, we ordered pork belly, and it was surprisingly good. For entrees, we ordered carbonara and risotto. The risotto was the best we've ever had! You do have to wait 45 minutes but it was worth every second plus it gives you time to chat with your date. The carbonara was alright. We probably won't order it again. The creme brûlée was fantastic! We will come back!"}
{"text":"I took my daughter and her boyfriend to Marinellas and we had a wonderful meal.  Delicious pasta.  My daughter had sea bass and said it was great.  Her boyfriend had traditional meatballs and pasta and loved it.   I had pasta with spicy red sauce.  The shrimp marinella app was great - and i'm not a cream sauce fan, but it was delicious.   Wine selection was superb.  We had a wonderful Barbera.    GREAT SERVICE!  I'm sorry I don't know if I have her name right - Keema?   So attentive."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food in Little Italy. We walked by several joint, and this place was packed and said thy made their own pasta in house. We had a great meal. Recommended."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and great ambience! Not sure what else you can ask for from a restaurant. I believe it's family-owned. Remember to make a reservation because the wait can be quite long.  I had the pork belly to start. Thick cut of smoked pork belly. Very good. I actually never had pork belly that good. Also had the papeto cheese. Very creamy and great texture but I expected it to be more tangy. Finished off with seafood risotto. Their Marinella sauce is so rich and creamy I ordered extra and mixed in with the risotto. Also dipped the pork belly in Marinella sauce too. I can literally drink that sauce.  It is a cute and romantic place for a date... but it was a bit noisy when i went last Saturday (the place was full)."}
{"text":"This place 5 STARS all the way. I would give them more than 5 stars if possible. Every time that I've been there it blew my mind with top notch consistent service, delicious food & reasonably priced menu. Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"Love... Love... Love... Marinela's. I first found Marinela's at their old location on Adelaide and Witmer. I came across the restaurant when I was walking around town.   I live in the U.S. and had been away from Toronto for 4 years. When I came back in 2012, I literally freaked when I discovered that Marinela's had moved. Luckily I found their new location and am in a happy place.  I've been to Toronto to visit my hubby who's working up here and have been to Marinela's several times. Visited Marinela's on Friday and was greeted warmly by John (Gianni). He's the quintessential host/owner. He's warm, genuine and truly loves people.  Friday night started with a fab Grey Goose martini. Appetizer was the Salumeria plate, which included four different cheeses and four different salumi. It was perfect for 3-4 people.... may be a bit much for 2 people. From there, it could only get better.  For dinner, I had the Fettucini Carbonara (did I mention that they make the pasta?), my husband ordered Fettucini Chicken Alfredo and our friend ordered the Wild Mushroom Risotto. Well, my Fettucini Carbonara was the bomb... my friend had pasta envy. The portion size was perfect.  Everyone enjoyed their entrees. Their wine list, while not extensive, is good. If you're looking for something special, John, knows the wines. as he buys the wine. We had a wonderful Musella Valpociello.... Yum Yum.  Not to overlook dessert... John's mother makes all the desserts. One of my last visits, \"Mama\" made a killer Lemon Cake (with lemon curd and limoncello). OMG.. it melted in your mouth. This go-around, the lemon cake wasn't on the menu, but there was a Lemon Ricotta Cheesecake, which was excellent... tart and not too sweet and the Chocolate Cake, which was decadent.   When we left the restaurant, John was gracious in his goodbye. When I mentioned that my birthday was coming up and loved the Lemon Cake, he said to call him in advance and that he would make sure it was available for me... What customer service! We said our goodbyes and said we would be back again...  Well, it was so good, that we dined there again on Saturday. John was surprised and happy to see us again. It was very busy as there were two large parties going on at the same time. He apologized that the entrees may take a little time, but we were fine with the wait. We enjoyed the same wonderful wine. My friend had his Fettucini Carbonara, while I tried the Seafood Fettucini. It was wonderful... it included lobster, shrimp, crab and mussels. Finished up with mama's Lemon Ricotta Cheesecake.   I AM A BIG FAN OF MARINELA'S. While it has been 4 years since I've been to the restaurant, it is by far the best Italian restaurant I've eaten at in Toronto."}
{"text":"Located in the Little Italy area, Marinella is a small restaurant serving some awesome Italian food. I recommend the Margherita Pizza, Spaghetti, and any specials they may be serving up on the day you go. I went there last night and they had a lovely lamb bolognese? fusilli. Pasta is fresh and the sauce on both the pizza and pasta was really nice! They switch up their desserts every day (I've seen desserts like a tuxedo cake slice, a creme brulee, and biscotti at different times), but they are always great. Highly recommend this place. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Took a friend to this restaurant for her birthday. They must have been having a very bad night. It seemed like it was going to be great, when the owner greeted us and told us that everything was made on site and to order. Two hours later when we still hadn't been served our meals and had already waited for nearly an hour for an appetizer that was comprised of bread and cold cuts, were told be a frazzled owner that well, it's made to order you know. We had ordered the specials, I had to send mine back because it was completely terrible. Very small portions all around. And we weren't properly taken care of on the bill after all. Frustrating and really spoiled my friends birthday."}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate a few friends' birthday. We unfortunately called for a reservation too close to the day we wanted to go and couldn't get a reservation until 8:45pm for a Saturday. We all arrived by 8:45pm and proceed to wait another 30 minutes after our reserved time because it was super busy.  Once they left, our server reset the table quite quickly for us, and we were seated immediately after. She went into detail about the specials, which was what I really enjoyed. When I accidentally spilled my glass of water, and despite a busy restaurant, she came immediately to help clean it up and gave me fresh glass of water, also making sure no wine was spilled.  I had looked at the menu online prior to this evening and I was really looking forward to having the osso bucco, but on this evening, we were told they had sold out of osso bucco. I suppose they're really popular. I have had one since my visit to Rome a few years ago.  We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share with everyone, we really fell in love with their seafood Marinella appetizer that was mixed seafood served in Marinella sauce that was secret in-house recipe. The Marinella sauce was so good, we ordered a side order of the sauce and asked for more bread. We demolished that while we waited for our main course. I ordered one of their specials, beef shank with polenta, It was delicious but came larger than I had expected and I ended up taking half of it home. Or maybe was the appetizers or the meal I ate at 6pm.  TL:DR - Food great, service great, make sure to book for a table well ahead of time."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place on a visit in Toronto and OH MY GOSH. Best pasta I've ever had."}
{"text":"My family and I came here while on vacation in Toronto. We chose this place because we saw that it had great reviews here on Yelp. The main reason as to why I deducted two stars was because of how incredibly slow the food took to arrive. We waited around 30 mins for the appetizers, and over an hour for the mains to arrive. While they did apologize for the delay, they did not offer any type of compensation (e.g. free dessert). I understand that they were really busy since the restaurant was more packed than usual, but waiting over an hour for food is unacceptable for any restaurant, and they could have closed off their patio to restrict the number of guests there. As for the food itself, it was good but nothing too special. The margarita pizza was overly salty, but the pasta (seafood fettuccine) was cooked well and the sauce was tasty. Luckily the service was good - our waiter was very friendly and welcoming. However, all in all I would not recommend this place to others since the food was definitely not worth the long wait."}
{"text":"We decided to take a chance without reservations on a Saturday night. We sat at the bar and met John (one of the Marinella sons) he was so friendly and told us all of the specials for the night. As luck would have it they had a cancellation and we were seated at a great table near the front. I ordered the Fettuccine  Carbonara and Tony had the spaghettoni Marinella. Our appetizer was the shrimp and it was so good I soaked up every drop with my bread. The dishes were excellent! Just enough home made pasta and perfectly al dente!  Thank you Marinella family for one of the best dinners we had while visiting Toronto from Texas!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!  Home made pasta and cured meats (copacolla, sorpresata) - unless you are on a budget, make sure you order the salumi plate. Perfect for 2 or 3, basically an upscale antipasto. 32 bucks, but very nice.  Server Fernando was really great. I always appreciate a server who is not afraid to give advice. He picked us a perfect Italian wine... and no it was from the lower price range.  Ok, don't argue with me, just order the lobster risotto. Outstanding. You will thank me later.  Finished with the tiramisu, a delightful interpretation of the classic.  Great restaurant, don't miss."}
{"text":"It was easy to book a reservation here and the ambience of the restaurant was quite nice. Everyone was friendly so far and the service from the busgirls/busboys were really good. The food was mostly made in-house, which was a nice touch.   Ordered bruschetta, calamari, lobster risotto, chicken alfredo fettuccine and the crème brûlée for the dessert.   The bruschetta was a big issue. As far as I know, the bread used for the bruschetta should be at least toasted but the bread was definitely not toasted and the tomato toppings did not taste good at all. I told the server and he told me that \"this is the traditional way of making bruschetta\", which was pure BS but whatever.   The calamari was savoury and flavourful but it was way too oily (oily to the point it made my partner puke).  I had mixed feelings about the lobster risotto. The risotto was cooked well with their homemade marinella sauce but the lobster was extremely salty.   For the chicken alfredo fettuccine, the pasta was cooked fine and the mushrooms were really fresh. However, the chicken was so overcooked that it was hard to chew on.  And finally, the crème brûlée was probably the best part of the meal. It was one of the better crème brûlées I had. Highly recommend this dessert but beware that this was $12. One pet peeve I had is that they don't give you a dessert menu to look at and instead, you have to listen to the waiter recite the desserts to you (which is not efficient at all).   Not sure if I would return here again."}
{"text":"I have been to so many restaurants in Toronto and believe me this place worth to visit !!!! The food is fantastic , the service too. The prices are normal for such place. Everything is clean and tidy. As i noticed owner is always there so the result is obvious- the restaurant in perfect condition."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had a \"girl's only\" trip to Toronto a few weeks ago and this was our special dinner out. It was absolutely fantastic (and very reasonable considering everything we had and the quality!).   Fresh homemade noodles, fresh homemade sauce and delicious appetizers (we had a selection of meats and cheeses and salads) and desserts (chocolate cake and tiramisu).  I don't remember exactly what our main entrées were but I can tell you this - they were both fantastic!    And, seriously the best chocolate cake I've ever had in my life!  I'm trying to find a way to get this cake shipped to VA for my son's birthday in June. It is THAT good!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the oily calamari and imported penne.The penne was not made al dente, vodka sauce was pretty good. Tiramisu had a very strong taste in alcohol."}
{"text":"Was coming up for the night for my boyfriends birthday and was tasked with finding a place for dinner.  He loves Italian so I thought it would be easy. I even remembered seeing a post on Facebook with an article about the best restaurants in Toronto.  I finally found the Italian place that was on the list so I looked at their reviews on yelp.  A majority said service was great but the food was okay.....I don't know why service ranks higher than food but anyways crossed that off the list and kept searching.  After reading many reviews and menus I found marinellas and my interest was more than piqued.  I loved this place, the food, the atmosphere, the service, everything.  We started with the calimari.  The breeding was amazing, almost like a beer battered fish fry breading.  I had a special for the evening a lamb ragu with lamb meatballs and lamb sausage.  The meat was amazing and tender and the homemade pasta superb.  Even my favorite Italian places back home don't make their own fresh pasta on the spot.  My boyfriend had the seafood pasta.  Again another amazing dish.  It was his entree that caught my eye before I heard about the lamb so next time we come I know what I'm getting.  To anyone out there for great Italian, go to this place."}
{"text":"Best Italian food I've ever had, hands down. The seafood fettuccine  and the fettuccini chicken Alfredo were AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Their credit processing was down,so we had to dig up cash.Usually I carry $20 total,but luckily this night I had more.  Bad customer service when our server asked if we had a reservation,which we didn't.Then he went on to say he was expecting a large party who did reserve on the patio,before seating us. We were there about 2 hours,and NO ONE came with a  large party. One that requires putting 2 ,or more tables together!Our server didn't tell us what the daily special was either to top the experience off.   The customer service took away from the otherwise fresh seafood,and rack of lamb. Veal Parmaggiana I've had better at other places,where the sauce had more flavor,and  more cheese.This is why I gave the place a 3 star.   Party of two had: Seafood Marinella,Veal Parmaggiana,Grilled rack of lamb chops."}
{"text":"An amazing experience....we got a last minute reservation and had a wonderful experience.   The.service.was incredible...so.accomodating...they were so friendly and got us seated as soon as.we.arrived which was 1/2 hr before our reservation because we wanted to leave earlier for a.show.   I really appreciated being greeted by the chef during our meal to see how we were enjoying it. I believe it is a.family run restaurant and I can feel (and taste) the love   We ordered the ceasar salad..shrimp marinella and seafood fettucini ....unreal. loved. every .bite.   Will be back very soon!!!! Thank you"}
{"text":"Had an outstanding time here. Very personable staff who just wanted to go out of their way to make people feel welcome at their restaurant.  I just sat at the bar and ate and drank their, but everyone was very friendly. I was just sad that I had to leave because I had such a great time.  These guys are known for their seafood and I tried their lobster pasta. Highly recommend this dish.  This is my goto Italian restaurant every time I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"5 stars for service - very attentive and made sure our glasses were always full.   Started off the with the salumeria tasting which was not bad but I wouldn't say it was something I'd order again for $28. We also tried their soup du jour and it was a chicken noodle soup that did not taste very good. Kind of sour/vinegar-y, shame it wasn't a different soup.  The Fettuccine chicken Alfredo was amazing! $17-20 and it was all made in house. Very impressed as it was rich and savoury. My boyfriend had the veal parmigiana $20-23 and he enjoyed it but said it was nothing special. He definitely liked my pasta better.   Their creme brulee is made in house and it is one of the best that I've ever had. Perfectly blow torched and creamy, you definitely have to save room for it!   Overall I'd come back just for the pasta and creme brulee. They've got an outdoor patio so you can people watch as you eat :)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite Italian resto's in Toronto. Super low key and unpretentious, this place really does make me feel like I am eating in an Italian home.   I've taken my fam jam here a few times, and food is always consistent. Their seafood pasta dishes are always jammed with seafood, and you don't leave hungry. Loved the lobster risotto! Not overly creamy, with perfectly cooked risotto. Simple, but well executed.   If you want solid food, without long line ups and a month wait for reservations, come here."}
{"text":"Definitely 5 out of 5 stars.  My wife chose this restaurant out of all the other places in Little Italy because she had a good feeling when she saw it. It was an awesome choice.  We treated ourselves with the appetizer platter, seafood linguine and osso bucco with pasta. Since everything is made in house, we were not surprised to see how good everything was. Our only regret is not staying for desert, we know it is amazing. Reason to revisit for sure.   It is true that the prices are on the high side , but it is worth it considering the taste, service and presentation."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night. Its my first time here and the server recommended me to try their popular lobster risotto. I didnt regret ordering it at all!m It was absolutely amazing! The texture was extremely smooth and the taste was perfect. Not too sweet or salty and the lobster taste wasn't too overpowering.  I can definitely say that this italian restaurant is one of the best along with Enoteca sociale!"}
{"text":"Recently did a fam-jam here with 6 of us on a Tuesday night.   Was really impressed with both the food and service.   The food here is mostly all made in-house, fresh pasta and they cure their own meats and cheeses. We started with a kind of meat and cheese charcuterie sampler, which was absolutely delicious. They will do a custom order to serve your party. It works out to about $10 per person, which I thought was a bit pricey considering we each only got to sample a couple tiny pieces of cheese and meat, but it was all pretty delicious.  They have pizzas on the menu (5 pizzas to be exact) and about 10-12 pastas. I tried the beet caprese salad which came with two colours of beets and mozzarella, was quite fresh and light. We also had a primavera pizza. The pizza here is thin crust but it has the doughy yet still flaky type perfect edge crust which I liked.   The server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and was very attentive with topping up water, making recommendations, etc.   Overall really good spot, one of the only places I can think of on College that knows how to do proper Italian food."}
{"text":"Last week I had a delightful dinner at Marinella at Grace and College with my girlfriend.  We weren't so sure at first due to the Opera music piping into the dining room ... and walked to a few other place, but returned because we liked what we saw on the menu.  One of the owners was in the front of house and greeted us as we walked to our table with our server.  The warm home-made whole buns were brought to the table with Olive Oil and Vinegar ... super-delish.  We shared a salad of beets, buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes - with a few tostas on the side Fantastic.  The buffalo mozzarella was soft and gooey ... and was served with a couple of dashes of reduced balsamic.  We shared two mains (you can order half or full orders), the Spaghetoni Aglio e Olio, as well as the Wild Mushroom Truffle Risotto.  Everything was home-made.  I have never had pasta taste like that before ... it was perfectly al dente ... it had texture, nothing was over done ... just right. The pasta dish also came with chopped tomatoes and black olives.  The risotto was amazing. Not too much truffle, as my girlfriend said ... and not over-cooked.  There was a wide range of wines on the menu ... and I thought that the wines served by the glass were a little expensive for what they were.  But, we had a nice bottle that the owner recommended and it was under $50.  Bottles are the way to go at Marinella.  The owner was kind enough to chat with us at the end of our meal and enjoyed talking about food.  Definitely one of the best restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"I used a groupon but don't think it would have been good value without it. This should be a 2.5 star review, but I put a 2 to balance the 4s and 5s.  First off, I was disappointed that the menu didn't have all of the options listed online. I wanted to try the bruschetta rustica. We opted for the shrimp marinella to start instead and it was absolutely delicious! Eight large shrimp in their brandy rosé sauce served with garlic toast - hard to go wrong.  For mains we had seafood linguini and wild mushroom risotto. The linguini was good but not spectacular and the risotto was unimpressive. It definitely could have used some more salt or parmagianno.   I'd be willing to try more dishes there but at $20 to $40 each, it's a little too risky for my wallet."}
{"text":"My best friend and I came here to satisfy my carb craving. The service was impeccable. We were promptly seated were briefed on what the menu offered.   We started with the in-house freshly baked bread with our pepato formaggi and sopressata salumi to go with her gin and tonic and my limoncello. I liked that the olive oil that accompanied the formaggi and salumi had a bit of kick to it. After that, she had the seafood risotto and I had the seafood linguine. The pasta was perfectly al dente and Marinella sauce was so delicious.  Overall, we had a comfortable and relaxing time. The servers were very gracious and laid-back. I'll definitely visit again if I'm craving Italian!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing personalized service. Amazing ambiance. I highly recommend their fettuccine dish. It has the best pasta sauce I've ever tasted. Everything here is amazing and the prices are reasonable for everything you're getting. Highly highly recommend this place and will be going back!"}
{"text":"The rice croquettes were delicious and the the lobster risotto came out and it was one of the best meals ever. So good and worth the wait since it's made to order."}
{"text":"Meal: Dinner, dine in  All Ratings out of 10:  Quality of food: 10 Food to Spend Value: 10 Quality of Service: 10 Overall Rating: 10  I am always looking for great Italian places to try, and I was told there was great Italian in Toronto. After doing some research, Marinella bubbled to the top. In addition to the great looking menu, the fact that they cured their own meat, made their own pasta (except for the Italian imported penne), and were a family run restaurant had me quite excited.  They have quite the drink list, including lots of wines and a very nice cocktail selection. I am a sucker for a lychee martini and decided to order that. It was easily the freshest tasting (and smelling) lychee martini I have ever had, and it was made perfectly. It was crisp and refreshing and a great way to start my meal.  I rarely talk about bread, but the complimentary bread is worth talking about. It is baked in the restaurant and is soft and fresh and utterly delicious. I almost always butter my bread, but this was bread that required nothing...no butter, no oil, nothing. I couldn't get enough of it, and it served as a great tool for sopping up the various delicious sauces throughout my meal.  We got a couple of salumeria tasting platters for the table. It came with a selection of sputini (veggies), salumi (in house cured meats), and formaggi (cheese). It pretty much covered most of the items listed, including soppressata, salami, and filettuccio for meats, shepherd's, asiago, friulano, and pepato cheeses, and veggies including beets, pickles, mushrooms, and roasted red peppers. The quality of everything was amazing, and I thoroughly enjoyed everything I had from the platter.  The Marinella sauce was talked up quite a bit by one of the brothers who runs the restaurant, describing it as addicting and to die for. He also added that it was his mother's recipe, and she was actually the one making it. With all of that, how could we not get it? We ordered 2 of the marinella apps...the shrimp and the seafood. The seafood also included shrimp as well as lobster, crab, and mussels, and both came with crostini on the side. Heavenly, divine, addictive, crack-like...all appropriate descriptions for the sauce. And the seafood? It was so delicious! It was all perfectly prepared, and combined with the sauce I really was in Heaven. The rolls made great sopping utensils to ensure not one drop of the sauce was wasted.  Even though I knew I would regret it later, I had to have both a pasta and an entrée. The Pappardelle Giovanni sounded incredible, as did the Veal Parmigiana, so I went with both. The pasta came out first, and let me tell you, this was easily the best pappardelle I have ever laid on my taste buds. Both the texture and the flavor were absolutely amazing. Not to be left out, the tomato sauce was stunning with a robust flavor, great consistency, and a perfect blend of spices. Then, to top it off, the homemade meatballs and Italian sausage that were in the pasta were just divine. I am not used to having a pasta dish with multiple meats where every aspect is made in house, but I always want it this way.  At this point I was already about to burst, and out came the veal parmigiana. It consisted of 3 breaded veal cutlets topped with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese, and it was accompanied by spaghettoni pomodoro and the chef's veggie choice, which tonight happened to be a garlic broccoli. The veal was literally the most tender I have ever had. Each bite melted in my mouth and caused a mosh pit to erupt in my mouth. The spaghettoni was also homemade and simply wonderful. The broccoli had a nice garlicky taste and perfect texture, not too hard and not too soft.  Due to how full I was, I shared bites with several folks at the table, and they were equally impressed with how amazing the veal was.  When we arrived, we were greeted by one of the brothers, and he walked us through his favorite aspects of the menu and keyed on several of the unique things they did. He even mentioned that they used to make the cheese in house, but due to milk prices it was cheaper to import the cheese. They definitely take the homemade aspect quite seriously! He stopped by to check on us after we got our Marinella appetizers, and I asked him to tell his mom personally how delicious it was. He did one better and brought her out to our table so I could tell her personally. They really made us feel at home, and if you couldn't tell the food was nothing short of divine. The prices were quite reasonable, and the portion sizes were very good.  I simply cannot recommend Marinella's enough. The next time I am in Toronto, it will be on my list, and if you have never been, you simply must go. I am holding out hope that I have room for dessert next time, though I am guessing that may be wishful thinking."}
{"text":"The food is great but the staff takes this place over the top. Friendly and relaxed with detailed knowledge of each dish. A must visit when in Toronto. My only regret is that I found this place on my last night in Toronto."}
{"text":"Best family run Italian Resto on College street!  You can always count on the specials to be delicious but my fav is the penne alla vodka (and get the cured meat app.- the dad makes it in his garage!)  As long as you don't get the pizza you will love this place.  Decor is sleek. Need a reservation on Friday nights."}
{"text":"We were here on NYE which might explain the slow service, but the food was also nothing to write home about. The best thing was the mocktail from the bar.   I tried the rack of lamb that came with a small side of pasta. The pasta was totally over cooked. Nothing worse than overlooked pasta. It was so mushy and slightly cold. I was rather disappointed. I'm surprised by all the positive reviews on their food. Lamb was probably fine, but can't remember much about it.  It took over 3 hours to get our appetizer, entrees and desserts out. It was abysmal. Who wants to eat dessert at 11pm? I get they were swamped on NYE so i still left it at 3 stars, but really, this should not be acceptable at any restaurant.  anyway, i wouldn't try it again but it's edible."}
{"text":"The lobster risotto was heavenly, best I've ever had.   5/5  Pork belly appetizer was good, but I wouldn't get it again. 3/5  I found the Osso buco too bland and I didn't enjoy the texture. 2/5  Though the server told us it would take 35 minutes for the risotto, we ended up waiting an hour and a half. I would definitely return just for the risotto though... it is worth the wait if you aren't in a hurry."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere in here was wonderful, the restaurant is family-run by mother and son, and the son was checking on all tables and asking guests if they were enjoying the experience. The service was reasonable and the food quality was nothing short of perfection. My recommendations: bruschetta, calamari, and the seafood risotto/seafood linguine!"}
