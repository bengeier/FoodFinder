{"text":"Sandwich au poulet grillé, viande complètement brûlée. La serveuse nous dit que c'est parce que le poulet est cuisiné sur le charcoal ... Le repas a été facturé sans compensation et le poulet est resté dans l'assiette car il était immangeable. 

Un client assis non loin nous a entendu discuter avec la serveuse et nous a dit qu'il constatait que les  plaintes des clients sur les commandes pas à la hauteur étaient fréquentes. 

Malgré le repas raté en question le restaurant semble propre et la fraîcheur des aliments globalement frais."}
{"text":"Ordered twice from there. The food is, in all honesty, disgusting. I had fish and chips, and poutine. I was astonished that the poutine was subpar. I mean, come on, how can you mess up Quebec's national dish so badly? As for the fish and chips, the fries were decent, while the fish itself was not very tasty."}
{"text":"This resto used to operate under the name Crocogrill. New name but honestly it's the same menu and practically the same staff.

I'll be honest, I come here only for their smoked meat poutine and it reeeeeeaaaaaallly hits the spot for me. Fries are perfect, gravy is on-point and the smoked meat is delicious. 

Price-tag is very reasonable too!

Service is friendly and quick and you can definitely come here for a quick lunch but it does tend to get busy so give your waitress a heads up when she comes see you.

Wifi is the phone number."}
