{"text":"The place was gross and I found a fly in my food. Also the workers are super rude. Especially the manager. I visited last night and the manager started fighting and arguing with me over a small request.Could not believe he was the \"manager\". Really this place disgusted me from the food to the interior all the way to its pathetic staff and owner, who btw stood there and didn't do anything.I have been going there for the last 3 years and I will NEVER go again, EVER. Avoid avoid avoid this place at all cost unless you want to be treated like shit.  When it was hells chicken that's when this place was always packed! Because the old owners actually gave a crap about their customers. This place is going down hill especially if they keep John the \"manager\" around. Go next door to bang bang where you won't be treated like scum and there food is wayyyyyy better.  Rude, gross, expensive"}
{"text":"The worst Korean bar ever!!! You have been warned. I have been coming to this bar for last 10 years before the change of new management, but I would never go there again, nor bring any of friends.  The new owner is terribly rude and draft beer tastes suck. The food is also considered not edible. The color of their cooking oil is darker than your engine oil..."}
{"text":"This place is only good for cheap alcohol.  The food, I think I can cook better. We ordered the half half chicken, the batter didn't taste good.  The Jelly was too sour, and the presentation of the beef tartare was bad, the taste was okay.  The spicy shrimp was too soggy. The soup of the ODEN tasted very instant noodle like.   I will only come back for alcohol."}
