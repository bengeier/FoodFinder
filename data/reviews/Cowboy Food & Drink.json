{"text":"Great smoked wings, chili, and ribs. Ate there several times in the last few months. Never had outstanding service. In fact, slow at times. But the last time, the server was beyond rude, told us she was glad we were leaving, and laughed as she walked away.

Sorry Cowboy, we won't be coming back any more."}
{"text":"I'm pretty much done with Cowboy BBQ in Bainbridge. For about 5 years this has been our neighborhood choice for dinner. Good atmosphere, good food, fairly priced. 

In the last year, a lot has changed, but for the worse. First they changed the menu a few months ago and dropped most of the stuff I will eat (fish and fowl.) That would be OK, but the remaining chicken choices have been poorly executed. 

The last 4 times, including last night, we sent food back because the order was either wrong or so overcooked it was inedible. Chicken wings are supposed to be saucy, not charred black crunchy. (Shouldn't the server take some responsibility and not deliver food that is so obviously overcooked?) 

The final straw was last night when I bit into my chicken quesadilla and there was a 1x1\" jagged pice of white plastic in it, probably from a plastic serving spoon or knife. That would have really hurt (or worse) had I swallowed it. They comped my meal, but not my wife's (which originally had to be sent back because they did not hold the tomatoes as requested). Even worse, the waitress avoided apologizing or even looking us in the eye until we left when she gave a feeble \"sorry.\" 

Wow. She's lucky I tipped her at all.

Places like this have no concept of the lifetime value of a customer. If I spend $30 -$40+ a month there, that's thousands of dollars they have lost by not showing any contrition or making any attempt to make up for what could have been a serious situation. 

Two thumbs down for Cowboy."}
{"text":"We were hesitant to try this based on the other Yelp reviews but I am so glad we gave it a chance.  Really exceptional service and the food was great.  I loved my brisket sandwich.  The rib special was also a great deal.  It seems a lot of effort has gone into improving the food/service lately and it really shows.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was not very good. Ribs were tough and sauce was definitely nothing special. Our server Cody was pretty good though. It's a bar with food that's good for a drunk after hours."}
{"text":"We go here every other week for trivia and love it. We aren't really very picky and as long as the people are nice and the food is pretty good, we're happy. We will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst BBQ places in chagrin the service was horrible all of the burgers where over cooked and the restrooms where repulsive with poop all over the seat no toilet paper"}
{"text":"Don't bother wasting your time.  The service at Cowboy is terrible!  For a second time this year, they refuse to divide a 50 plus person (kid team sport celebration) bill according to family participants and simply divide it randomly and require a 20% gratuity.  We waited over 20 minutes for drinks and they had not even taken our food order by then.  The food is mediocre at best and no where near what it was when it first opened by Longo. Highly NOT recommended. For groups, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Saturday night band called In Demand was unbearably loud.  Food was lukewarm and average at best"}
{"text":"Fabulous everything!  Salmon was fresh -tasting and would be excellent at twice the price.  Fab margarita and the combo plate with an array of four BBQ sauces and great sides can't be beat.  Great atmosphere and clean too."}
{"text":"I started for here a couple of times but never made it.  This time, I went in.  Either someone's designed a smokehouse air freshener or this place has real bbq.  I don't know for sure because I got the burrito.  -didn't want to spend $20 on a lunch plate.  But it smelled really good...

Actually, I'm not sure how much the burrito was either- surely less than $10.  The menu read like this:

Pulled Pork   10
Brisket    16
Baby Back Ribs     18

I ended up making my food decision based on the waitress's recommendation.  I didn't realize before that the number without the dollar sign was the price, (those aren't the actual prices, by the way.  Just an example of how the menu reads.

So, anyway, for an appetizer I ordered 
Chips and Salsa        5
The salsa was fresh with roasted tomatoes.  An effort was made here to make it good.  Very basic though.  Just tomato and mild heat.  I couldn't tell if the chips were fresh or not.  They were very uniform and evenly cooked which makes me think probably from a bag.

The burrito was very interesting- about Chipotle size.  The waitress talked it up like it was going to be huge.  Not so...  I can eat a Chipotle burrito, a bag of chips and two tacos.  So I had no problem finishing this burrito.  I got it with bbq chicken and fully loaded.  It was pretty good but very busy with like, grilled onions and saut√©ed mushrooms.  Something had the distinct flavor of coriander or curry powder.  I think it was coming from the mushrooms.  The best burritos use few ingredients.  For example:  Chicken Burrito.  Ingredients- chicken, tortilla, spices.  Still big!  Mostly, you can only get big burritos if they're stuffed with sh#*!.  If you go to Chipotle and order a chicken burrito with JUST chicken, it'll be pencil thin. 

To cut this short, I like this place.  It was good and not typical.  The staff was nice and the place is attractive.  One complaint-  the six pack of sauces they bring to the table was kind of gross.  So much gunk on the squeeze bottles of bbq sauce that I could have tried their whole menu just by licking the bottles."}
{"text":"They smoke their chicken wings instead of deep frying and they are very tasty with good sauces.  Burgers are decent and pulled pork is good but drowned in sauce.  Bartenders and servers are always friendly.  Kitchen can be slow sometimes and inconsistent.  Happy hour is decent."}
{"text":"Are there new owners?  Went last night.  Waitress terrible.  Not exactly their fault...But the food took FOREVER to come up...."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic Brisket Mac & 3 Cheese, moist creamy, flavorful. I dotted Cowboy BBQ sauce on and it took it to another level .  My husband enjoyed his Bacon Cheese burger - done perfectly, juice and flavorful.  Fries crispy and dashed with a wonderful dry rub.  Great ambiance, lots of screens for the sports enthusiast.  Absolutely no complaints.  Excellent service and we will be back."}
{"text":"Seated fast. Service was good. Food was good. Fun games for the kids. I tried the ribs, they were delicious, meaty and smoky.  We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Love Monday kids eat free!   Great wings and killer burritos!   This is always my kids pick when we go out due to the video games too!"}
{"text":"They straight up wouldnt let me get chicken fingers cause I was over twelve this is bullshit i just wanted my damn chicken fingers"}
{"text":"My husband and I dine here often. If you can get here for the happy hour menu you're lucky. It's large and great priced. The smoked wings are some of the best. The pulled pork is excellent. The service is superb. You gotta try this place"}
{"text":"I am currently sitting in this restaurant an hour and 20 minutes into my visit having had 1 glass of wine,  an appetizer (pretzels, which were partially still frozen) and no main course, which we ordered 45 minutes ago.  The waitress has not been back to our table in 25 minutes at least.  My whole table has been waiting to place another drink order for longer than that. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great service and food. I got the fish tacos, which were decent- although I thought they had a lot of cabbage on them. 3 tacos for $9. I couldn't finish all 3 for my lunch. My mom got the pulled pork with sweet potato fries and it was absolutely delicious! We would come back here to try more of the food."}
{"text":"Not a fan. I've lived in Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Texas so I'm familiar with good BBQ and this isn't even close. Pulled pork was 80% fat and the meat I was able to eat was very dry with no flavor. It was a Friday evening so I was expecting fresh food. Sides tasted like they were frozen not fresh. Atmosphere would be nice to go have drinks with friends but won't be going there for dinner again."}
{"text":"Cowboy is good, not great.  The patio is nice and the food selection is solid barbecue.  Still, when you think BBQ, you usually remember a place that you can just totally rave about.  Cowboy is solid, but if it wasn't so close to my home, I probably wouldn't go there as much as I do.

Make no mistake, the restaurant is well worth your time if you are in the area and you want a good meal.  Then again, I wouldn't tell anyone to go way out of their way to find their way there."}
{"text":"Food was good, service is terrible! Walked in and no one was there to greet or sit - had to find someone to ask if they were seating. 

Got sat 15 mins later and no waitress showed up - went to the bar to get our own drinks. 

I've eaten here before  - food was great, service subpar - this trio service was terrible, almost nonexista"}
{"text":"Good services, family friendly environment. The food is average. I haven't ate anything here that I love. Went on a Saturday night and it was packed! But the service was fast which is great especially with smaller kids!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but it was only OK.
Looks like something you'd find in a movie, decor is a little strange, almost like a big warehouse and you just shoved some tables in it, and a bar and a stage but not much more than that. Like almost no decor at all.

People watching IS interesting here. Lots of leather and biker couples, other cute hipsters and suburban types.

Service was painfully slow and awkward. Despite the lack of a hostess most of the time, you cannot seat yourself - so if you do, you will get kicked out of your seat and back to the waiting area.

Food is really not memorable. It was OK, probably not as good as the same thing I could make at home."}
{"text":"We have been going to The Cowboy for years. It has really gone downhill in the past 3-4 years. We loved their wings. They were smoked. But lately even those have been a disappointment. Last night we ordered wings to go, with 2 sides, Cole slaw and tater tots. The wings were so smokey we couldn't finish eating them . The slaw was tasteless, leaving only the tater tots edible. Unless they have a major shake-up we probably won't go back again. A shame because they are only a few minutes away from home."}
{"text":"First of all, this barbecue is smoked.  Not baked, not par boiled and then stuck in an oven.  It's hand rubbed and slow smoked and as a lover of barbecue I don't eat anything else.
Second, don't go to a barbecue place for salad, or fish, or anything not associated with smoked meats.  My daughter likes the salad with smoked chicken breast but as I have told her, if you want salad don't go to a barbecue place.  My wife actually asked if they had an unoaked Chardonnay and didn't get thrown out.
Third, it has both St. Louis and baby backs.  That's a real plus for lovers of barbecue.  The links are good and not store bought but not made in house.  Brisket and pulled pork are very good so get a sampler of both.  Wings are big meaty fresh and smoked.  Buffalo wings use a dry rub for the kick not bottled house sauce and deep fried frozen wings.
The service is OK and friendly wait staff, basically young locals.  Beer could be colder and they should bring in some local brews.  I see some complaints about the service and never experienced bad service.  
Believe it or not Cowboy has first rate guacamole.  So get a beer, order some guac and enjoy some authentic smoked BBQ."}
{"text":"Great place for BBQ! Game room for kids, live bands, large bar and daily specials. Always clean and willing to accommodate all size groups. Very nice staff- excellent food."}
{"text":"We went on Sunday with family as we were in the area & in need of dinner. The service was average at best, but in the servers defense, they seemed understaffed. My burger was huge but undercooked. I ordered medium and it was more rare. The fries were greasy & limp and the cheesy corn was served lukewarm.  MMMM. Yummy, right?The pop was flat and I got zero refills. Then, when I got home a host of stomach issues began, which I cannot necessarily contribute to the dinner but the timing would indicate it was responsible. It is unlikely we would pick this place again if we were in the area & in need of food. So, I  guess if you want spotty service and food that may cause stomach issues, this would be the perfect spot for you! $34 not well spent. If I could go back in time and un-eat this, I would. Also, unrelated to the food, the bathroom was freezing. I think I got frostbite in there"}
{"text":"The Cowboy isn't the most delicious restaurant I've ever been to, but I'm a big fan of the all around Cowboy experience. The bands are great, servers are sweet, drinks are strong, patio is lovely and the crowd is friendly (albeit, maybe a tad bit drunk...thus making it all the more interesting).

The smoked wings with Chipotle is one of my favorite orders. It's not that the food is bad at the Cowboy, it just isn't mind blowing."}
{"text":"Bartender spent more time catering to a group of off duty employees than those around the bar. Tried the Tri tip steak.   It was alright, but both sides (beans and sweet potato fries) were horribly over cooked and dried out.   Not worth the money at all."}
{"text":"Awful service - no matter what we get - always same bill.  Go to McDonald's, buy a six pack and go to the park instead."}
{"text":"This place is ok. It's at the end of a small strip mall. Went with a party of six on a Wednesday night and had no problem getting a table. The place was pretty empty and from what I understand it's usually that way. 
Cool atmosphere and casual spot with plenty of tvs to watch games. They also have a pinball machine, a few video games, basketball game and juke box. It's loud and seems to be family friendly all the time. 
The food was ok and menu isn't large but has plenty to choose from. The wings are really good. However, rest of the items we ordered were subpar. Beef brisket, taco salad, smoked turkey, cowboy burger were all average. I had the pulled pork BBQ beans and cornbread - it was real good. Plenty of cold beer on draft and full bar. 
Service was good. The waiter was on the ball but the kitchen was off. It took so long for the food to come out the manager took money off the bill. Don't expect such slow service when a place is dead. Can only imagine if there was a crowd! 
If heading to Cowboy I'd stick to beer and wings or something smoked!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was incompetent. By the time she brought our drink orders out, we had all figured out our orders and closed our menus. She dropped the last drink and ran like we were the plague. So we waited and waited and waited... 
Finally she came back and took the orders, which took FOREVER to come out. There was a table of 4 right next to us who sat down after we ordered our food and got their food before us!
The food was not great. Well, my BBQ bacon burger was, but everyone else's food (ribs, bbq sundae, brisket) was sub-par. If this place is going to claim to be \"Texas Barbeque\" it had better follow through. And it didn't.
After we were all done eating, we didn't see the waitress for a good 15 minutes. When she showed up, she didn't have the check ready and she started clearing the dirty dishes instead of taking the ones we wanted to take home to the back to box them up. Then, she disappeared with the credit card for another 10 minutes. We had small children with us who could not sit at a restaurant for TWO HOURS and be still while we waited for the waitress to take care of us. It was very rude and we will not be back."}
{"text":"On different visits here I have ordered the Pit roasted beef brisket and the half chicken.  Both times the meat was  overcooked and very dry.  The cornbread was so overly sweet that it tasted like birthday cake.   The beans, at least, were excellent.  

Slow, overpriced, overcooked food.  

We won't be going back anymore.  Seems to have gotten worse over the past 5 years.

At least they have a cool bar and live music. 

Patio is nice when people aren't smoking out there. 

Kid friendly."}
{"text":"In a fit of homesickness for barbecue, I went there just before I moved back home to Texas.  My first clue that this wasn't going to end well was the $6 price tag for a Shiner Bock. The waiter/bartend then assured me that their brisket had been smoke for 14 hours and was as good as anything back in Texas. Mighty bold words for a bunch of Yankees! I took them up on it. I can honestly say that if I'd have peeled the soles off of my boots, boiled them for 14 hours and doused them with store-bought BBQ sauce, they still would have tasted better. I read elsewhere on this site that they do great \"Texas\" barbecue. Buying a McRib at the McDonalds while changing planes at IAH or DFW does not constitute TEXAS barbecue!!!!  If you want Texas barbecue, Southwest has reasonably priced flights to Austin, Houston & Dallas! 

Please quit calling your barbecue Texas style. It's an insult those of us from Texas!"}
{"text":"I'm not understanding where the negative reviews for the food are coming from. The food is some of the most amazing melt-in-your-mouth bbq I've ever tasted!!!! I ordered the smoked brisket with a side of mac and cheese and seasonal veggies (green beans). The veggies were very well seasoned, mac and cheese was average. But the brisket...holy crap it was good! It broke apart easily with my fork, sauce was delish..i didn't want it to end! My husband's wings were equally amazing. He ordered the bbq flavor. 

The server was the only reason for the four stars.She wasn't attentive at all. We were one of maybe four tables, and we're almost the only party left when our check arrived, at 10 pm on a Saturday. We waited for 15 minutes to order and had to send the bartender to find her...twice...for her to pick up the check. Again, there were hardly any tables left. I usually am very empathetic for servers, as I've been one. But she was terrible sorry. Otherwise a delicious meal and nice spot."}
{"text":"This place has amazing Texas -style slow-cooked barbecue.  I am a regular here and this is the go-to dinner spot for my wife and I and our daughters love it here too.  Casual atmosphere, a pool table and some arcade games are a nice distraction for the little ones.  The stage is used for live music entertainment and there is outdoor seating for the brief outdoor dining season in NE Ohio.    The pulled pork dinner with sweet potato fries and baked beans comes with a corn bread muffin.  My wife is a fan of the chicken or pulled pork 'wet' burrito.   They have a unique dish called barbecue sundae: pulled pork layered under a layer of cole slaw and baked beans.   I wish they would bring back the barbecue spaghetti as this was my fav dish!"}
{"text":"Service is awful. After 9 pm on Friday night, waitress cash out  for end of the shift. No replacement waitress afterwards. We have to go up to the bar to get our own drinks.  Bartender had sort of an attitude, didn't even finish filling the drink order, she wonders off to fill another drink from order machine, comes back and gave us the total. 

I was observing from 9 am on, I didn't really spot any manager around running the restaurant. The hostess was running around back and forth. Few waitress left in restaurant throughout the night but never near us. Kitchen staff is fully loaded not taking any orders.

There's a lot of lost food and beverage revenue there. Waitress could have maximized potential food sales and tips during the band. Have a 9 pm to 1:30 am bar food specials going. 

We ended leaving the place hungry looking for other restaurant to order food. Maybe have to come earlier to try food again."}
{"text":"Great place to go on a Sunday  afternoon if you want a leisurely lunch. The BBQ Brisket sandwich was delicious and the waitress attentively refilled our soft drinks. We're looking forward to returning in the evening to have a brisket dinner!"}
{"text":"Had the worst ribs in my life  warmed up tough  total waste of money. Pass this one up. Had to find waitress to pay bill. 
Warren"}
{"text":"Cowboy is what it is. It's okay. I go every few months for a wings night or apps and beer but there's really nothing that draws me to come back. No one is overly attentive or friendly even when they are slow."}
{"text":"The inmates are running the asylum here. No management at all. Our second server was drunk a skunk and slurring words. Clearly enjoying the free employee drinks more that the customers. Amazing. No wonder the parking lot was empty the previous night  

Not going back ever"}
{"text":"Great food! Service is solid . However, management is a revolving door.  Can't commit to fixing issues like fixing Internet during football season. They promote a tailgate menu but can't get scores or fantasy due to lack of commitment by manager as to when Internet will  be fixed( when asked)"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant In Chagrin falls. Nice selection of beers. Nice casual burger joint.  The appetizers are phenomenal.  Always prompt service. Nice bands. Large kids area of video games to give you time to chat  with other people in your party.  Food is always consistent"}
{"text":"Loved it! One of the funnest places in our area. Great menu items and drinks selection and nice atmosphere. I also love that they have the \"kids eat for free\" day and other daily specials. Definitely plan to bring the entire family there."}
{"text":"Cowboy catered our neighborhood party with pulled pork and chicken. I had mentioned seeing their catering advert and they threw in a pan of sausage with peppers and onions. They also let us use their hotbox to help keep everything warm. There were raves from everyone. Everything tasted wonderful. 
A big thank you to Ron and his great staff!"}
{"text":"Part of a group that follows EMG, when the band plays we come to Cowboy and indulged. Like the shredded BBQ and the ribs with the different sauces. Fish tacos are very good. Hamburgers are a good choice. Salads are so-so. After all, this is a cowboy sports bar. Decent beer selection and special drinks to choose from. Chips and salsa!
Pool table and some video games. Karaoke night. Check the website for more."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place. Inattentive staff and huge empty feeling room with no decor is a bit weird. Not really feelin' the \"cowboy\" vibe."}
