{"text":"This is the kind of place you come only for their specialty. I ordered a small dark chocolate mousse and it was OK - the kind you could simply purchase for less than half of the price at the supermarket. Service was prompt and good. I would come back to try the crepes which looked amazing."}
{"text":"Green Tea Crepe ($9.29) - served with red bean and sponge cake wrapped in thin pancake, homemade green tea ice cream and whipped cream on the side.  Beautiful and attractive appearance.  The crepe was thinly made, soft and smooth; it had perfect texture and tasted light.  The matcha green tea was amazing.  It had a strong green tea flavour and was not sweet, true and real to taste.  Not much red bean and sponge cake were found in the crepe, so I was somewhat disappointed.  The crepe is a 'individualized' or 'separated' version of a matcha red bean chiffon cake.  Nothing can go wrong with the combination of these ingredients; they are made for each other!  Nevertheless, it was still scrumptious.  Regular sized Hazelnut Flavoured Latte ($4.89) was HUGE!  The drink had very strong hazelnut flavour and sprinkled with real hazelnut bits.  Very legitimate~  The frothy hot milk was very fun to drink.  It felt like a bubble bath, blowing the bubbles and giggles everywhere.  This latte was that enjoyable."}
{"text":"Came here with my sister on the weekend.  It wasn't overly busy but for some reason the waitress avoided taking our order for almost 15 minutes but had no problem refilling the water glasses at the table beside us several times.  My sister ordered the mushroom crepe and I had the chicken one.  I don't know what kind of chicken they used but it was far from being the texture of chicken.  Seemed more like soggy chicken flavoured tofu.  I'm adding some pics, was not impressed with the plates they served the meal on.  Seriously can't you afford to invest in new dishes that don't have chunks cut out!  Disgusting.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"I tried Pastel on March 2015. I ordered tropical crepe and it was terrible basically it had no fruits at all and lots of creme. I don't recommend this place to any one."}
{"text":"Great little dessert place! Crepes are light, and a good portion size and not too expensive. They even make their own ice cream! I recommend the green tea shaved ice. It looks nothing like what you get at other places, which are just fancy snow cones. It's more like shaved ice cream that comes out in waves.  Service was also very good, the ladies who work there are nice and polite.   Place was also very clean."}
{"text":"I was doing a review for another dessert place and wanted to give this place the rating it deserves. Always consistent,  always good,  never had a complaint on my numerous visits. The only downfall is the lack of seating because the place is small. But hey,  that's because this place is worth coming back for hence they are always fully seated. A definite recommended dessert house in North York. We recommend the green tea matcha frosty flakes (shaved ice)  and the sweet potato crepe."}
{"text":"The best dessert in Toronto. Matcha greentea crepe and nut waffle are my all time favorite. Free wifi is a bonus.Highly recommend this place..."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 2 after lunch on a Sunday.  We walked in and we were immediately welcomed and seated. WiFi password was provided on the stand up menu as the server was prepping the table.  I did notice a minimum charge of $5 per person, though this didn't apply to us even though we shared 1 dish but it's something to keep in mind.   Both of us shared 1 order of the matcha red bean crepe as we had time to kill waiting for the movies.  The portion was not very big but just enough for the both of us.  The presentation of the dish was great but the red bean inside the crepe not very well distributed, I didn't eat a single red bean until i got through half the crepe. Even though I'm not a fan of whip cream, I still find this dish very enjoyable. The green tea ice cream is very good and it's infinitely better than the complimentary ones you get for dessert after sushi.    Overall very satisfied with the service and the crepes. Feel like the place is a little bit cramped for a party of 2 though.  Would come back to try something new next time."}
{"text":"This place is amazing...I was introduced to this dessert house a few years ago by one of my good friends, and I have always taken my close friends here since then. The dessert is so fantastic (the shaved green tea ice cream is heaven in your mouth), and the atmosphere is very relaxed. Highly recommended for dates and small get togethers."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp as my bf and I were looking for some good coffee place after our dinner.  I had a cappuccino and he a dark forest latte.  Both drinks were preety good as well as desert.  Overall a nice, but small coffee place if you are in the mood for desert."}
{"text":"Love the crepes here! The restaurant is pretty small but we got lucky and didn't have to wait long for a table of 6. My favourite is the green tea crepe, which has red bean and sponge cake inside, with green tea ice cream on the side. So delicious! Their drinks are pretty good as well - I got the frozen nutty chocolate. a decadent iced chocolate drink with nuts topped off.   My friend got the green tea frosty flakes. It was refreshing and tasty, but presentation definitely needs work. The chocolate shavings kind of looked like dirt and the random glob of red bean paste on the side just looked weird.   Service was prompt and friendly. They did forget about my drink but made it right away when I followed-up on it."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious. All the deserts are made fresh.   We ordered the smoked salmon savoury crepe and the strawberry shortcake crepe. It was plate licking delicious.  The water cups should be larger, as it barely holds any water. But everything else is on point.   Nice atmosphere and minimalistic and clean decor. I recommend this place to all my friends.   It is a great place for a late night desert date with great teas and drinks. Or a great late breakfast place, however it doesn't open until 12pm. So it really depends when you prefer start your day.   High five to Pastel Creperie!"}
{"text":"I ordered their green tea latte which was really good. Flavour wise, has the great matcha flavour. I wish it were a little bit sweeter because I have quite the sweet tooth but it was drinkable without extra sugar. Mainly got it for the latte art which does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Love the crepe here~ My personal favourite is the nutella one~"}
{"text":"Ordered the greentea crepes and tropical crepes. The crepes did not disappoint, it wasn't too sweet or too rich to finish toward the end with the cream and sponge cake. However the green tea ice cream tasted a bit weird but I didn't mind.  However, I mainly wanted to write this review for the service, because it was simply amazing and definitely added a lot to the overall experience. The employees were so nice to assist with parking and also to ensure we had the best quality of food.   I would definitely come back very soon as one of my hang out place with friends !"}
{"text":"I love the brother and Sister partnership and they provide very good service and suggestions.  I was there first month since they opened and I keep re-visit them!  Love their crepes!  I tried every one of them, all are good.  I have to agree that the waffles has room for improvement.  Their decaf coffee is also good!   I will say it is one of the very few places that can provide you a good quality of food, service at down town feel."}
{"text":"I had the chocolate Oreo parfait there which is exactly I've imagined. It goes pretty well with the summer evening breezes and outdoor seats. The service was also great. However, besides that when me and my boyfriend entered the door, there were four men sitting in a table, staring at us as if saying why we're here which ruined my mood completely. We are no different than anyone else and I can't stand being judged just because our appearance or even worse race? I guess that birds of a feather flock together."}
{"text":"I love crepes, whether they are savoury or dessert crepes. I've been to Pastel a few times and I've tried their Mushroom Crepe and Nutella Crepe. The Mushroom Crepe was alright, but it was on the salty side. I probably wouldn't order it again. However, the Nutella Crepe was pretty good and it wasn't overly sweet in my opinion. The banana really helped to balance the flavour and the chocolate ice cream mixed with bites of the crepe tasted scrumptious. I've also tried what I believe is called the \"Frozen Chocolate\". It's a cold drink and tastes sort of like a milkshake, but it was much too viscous and I could barely get it through the straw. Definitely not one of the best drinks I've ever had. The shop itself is on the smaller side, but they do offer ~7-9 tables indoors if I'm not mistaken. They also have a patio for when the weather is warm.  The service is good and someone always comes by periodically to refill my water. I would come back again to try their other savoury and dessert crepes, but I'd probably skip out on the Mushroom Crepe and Frozen Chocolate."}
{"text":"I love this place! A good mix of Asian flavours (for example black sesame ice cream) and other unique flavours (sweet potato). The crepes are mixed with cream and a layer of airy cake.  Good place for lunch as they have a good lunch special with savory crepes!"}
{"text":"The cheesecake I ordered was so old it had hardened on the outer layer, even the whip cream on top had hardened.  This is because they order cake pieces from another place and it just sits there in the glass display until it's gone.  I'm sure their crepes, which are made on site, are much better.  But I'd never order anything else, especially from their cake display."}
{"text":"This place is small but bright and intimate. The space is very clean (they wipe down all the chairs, even the bar where you put your foot!) with very attentive staff.  One of, it not the cleanest restroom with nice and simple decor.  The food is amazing...new love for black sesame ice cream.   Found my new dessert joint."}
{"text":"Being coming for a few years. Their food keeps improving. Very nice to come with some friends and spend a good time with their desserts and coffee."}
{"text":"I came here once and ordered a Green Tea Crepe. This was one of the best crepes I ever had! Craving one right now actually! I came quite early in the day, so service was extremely fast. I can imagine this place to be packed at night though!   Pastel is a perfect place to satisfy your sweet tooth cravings, but wouldn't be a place to sit for hours. The location is relatively small so the seating is closer with other parties, and there are no sofas/couches."}
{"text":"I really dont understand why people love this place so much.  I came n a saturday night at around 10 pm and every table was occupied.  I ordered a shortcake crepe and it tasted fine.  However, the crepe was too tough to cut with the knife.  Im not sure if it was because the crepe was cold, or because the blade of the knife was dull.  I was also not very impressed with how cramped that place was.  My table was not even an arm length away from the table next to us.  I can literally hear the whole convo the customers sitting next to us.  I got a bit annoyed with how noisy the place was.  The last thing is that neither the \"photo book\" nor the menu showed all the variety of cakes offered.  I ordered the choco pisstachio mousse but when i was leaving the place, i was surprised that they had different kinds of cheesecakes displayed in their display window.  If i had known there were cheesecakes i would have ordered the pistachio cheesecake.  Although i gave this place a 2  star, i will probably come back on a weekday night when it is less crowded."}
{"text":"This place has pretty nice decor and I have been here a couple of times.  Last time I had the matcha latte but it was much much too sweet.  I could only finish half before my teeth started to hurt."}
{"text":"I'll update in detail later but for now:  The desserts look like they taste better than they actually do. Great for pictures but not that yummy.  The savoury crepes are great!"}
{"text":"Great place for an afternoon coffee or brunch. Usually very busy, not enough seats. Their crepes and lattes are good."}
{"text":"This place has the most delicious waffle.. Quite, cozy, and small caffe which I like about it.. Today was my fourth time at this place and for sure won't be the last one .. The service is good and fast.. Waitress were very nice and polite.. If you want to have a nice time with your friends, it's the right place.."}
{"text":"This place is nice n quit, the latte was really good, I haven't tried the crepe yet but will definitely go back to try it! I like the simplicity feel of the place, somewhere I can sit, enjoy a drink while getting some work done :)"}
{"text":"Really nice dessert place. The place is a bit small, but they have great selections of ice cream and crepes. A dessert plate costs more than $10 but you got two scoops of ice cream and crepe."}
{"text":"Good choice for a dessert place! Small and cozy. The crepes are always large and filling, whether sweet or savoury. There is parking, service is courteous and quick, and the food is good (and picturesque!). The sweet crepes are a little too sweet for my preference, but it's a nice treat every once in a while. Would recommend the black sesame crepe!"}
{"text":"So happy I found this place on Yelp! The food here is really fantastic. I always go for the crepes and I've tried a few on the menu and each one has been amazing. The place is so tiny so service is generally very good and the staff are friendly. The tables are a little too close to each other and it can feel crammed especially during busy hours and the water glasses they give you are tiny. The price for a tea is also overpriced for the tea cup size but I always go back for those amazing crepes."}
{"text":"I wish I had their crepe batter recipe!! It's so amazingly awesome.   My friend loves their sweet crepes, but I've only ever had their savoury crepes, which are generously filled, and also come with a decent side salad. The salad comes with a vinegary dressing, which I always ask for on the side.   Service is usually quite prompt. A nice quiet spot on the weekday afternoons. WIshed they were open in the mornings for breakfast too. Crepes with maple syrup!"}
{"text":"Good crepes, nice decor, a little bit pricy."}
{"text":"I'm back visiting my parents and Pastel is as good as ever. I had the matcha green tea ice cream and crepe and sweet potato latte and they're all extremely good. I have to try their green tea ice flake next time. The picture is so attractive."}
{"text":"I ordered mushroom crepe. A friend had sesame ice cream with crepe. Both are so tasty. The crepe smelled like vanilla but not overpowering. It is my new crepe favorite after moving from Winnipeg which has similar popular creperie: Kawaii Crepe."}
{"text":"Hands down the best crepe place !! I came here twice and absolutely loved it. I was full both times and couldn't resist and still finished the whole plate.   The first time, I had the sweet potato crepe and you can really taste it in the ice cream. They put the sweet potato inside the crepe as well. The second time I had the black sesame crepe and the ice cream was so good! Inside the crepe this time was black sesame cake.  I would 100% recommend coming here! The only thing I would point out is their water cups could be bigger. Since everything is so sweet, prob need to drink more water haha As well, the place is kind of small, so I would not recommend coming here on Friday or weekends. I had to wait 30 mins. Whereas on a weekday, I didn't have to wait at all !"}
{"text":"Location: On Yonge just south of Finch. Street parking is available (free after 9m). Pastel closes at 11pm.  Facility: Modern and clean. Patio is really cute too. Ample spacing for an establishment on Yonge St. On an average summer day, I'd opt for the patio because A/C is on full blast inside. If you're sitting by the washroom, you will be right under the A/C and it will get cold.  Food Quality & Price: Size, portion and prices of crepes and waffles are comparable to Demetres. Many say it is very pricey, it is typical (most crepe places are over-priced regardless). I ordered the Chocolate with Marscapone cheese (second visit: sweet potato crepe was also wonderful). Absolutely delish!! Would get it again next time. They can also make substitutions if you don't like something specific in your order (i.e. toppings or ice cream).  IMO, one plate is too much for one person. I would split with a friend/partner unless you're ready for a diabetic coma.  Service: Our waitress (who also worked behind the counter) was sweet and generally efficient on a busy Friday night. No complaints. She didn't go above and beyond, but everything from delivering food to transactions was seamless.  Overall: I would return to Pastel again for crepes if I'm in the area. I really like the patio area and I personally, prefer their dessert crepes over Demetres."}
{"text":"This is a nice small Cafe with a cute decor though the Christmas decoration in the middle summer did throw me off.   Order the sweet potatoes Crepe with homemade sweet potato (maybe taro?) ice cream and the watermelon slush drink. Both were very delicious. The Crepe was light and fluffy and the ice cream complimented the Crepe very well. Nothing was overly sweet which is perfect. The watermelon slush was very refreshing for the hot summer day.   Service was very good and the waitress checked on us frequently. Overall, had a very good first time here and would definitely come back to try their other crepes."}
{"text":"This is not a fancy cafe, but the desserts are delicious!  You don't need to spend a ton of money to get amazing food!  Green tea shaved ice was wonderful, and my husband and daughter (who hates nuts) loved the nut crepe and almond ice cream.  Be prepared to buy your own and NOT share as you will be licking the plate."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and have tried both their sweet and savoury crepes! Although the store is quite small, the service and food is excellent. In my opinion their savoury crepes are slightly better than their sweet crepes and they come with a salad! Try getting their lunch menu because it's only $10.99 (incl crepe + drink). Drink wise, I've had their white chocolate mocha and their green tea latte, both were pretty good. Come check this place out! I'll be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Pastels, and I went with a friend.  I wish I had found this sooner (!) seeing that I frequent North York.   Had the waffle with black sesame ice cream made fresh, the smell is amazing! Portion size for a single serving is best to share with a friend! And a Mint Latte in a huge cup!  Place was busy, and intimately small. Waited in line for a seat on a Thursday night. Worth it! On a totally different tangent, speaking about seats, the first thing I noticed were their chairs. Emeco Navy chairs... ooo Comfy and nice to look at!"}
{"text":"Cute, charming little fusion Asian crepe cafe with a nice selection of drinks, desserts, savoury and sweet crepes. The pastries are French inspired and very fresh. A great spot to bring your best friend to catch up on life. Parking is a bit of a pain."}
{"text":"They way they make any desserts or drinks is made with love. They are so delicate when making crepes and even more when serving them. You gotta try their taro ice cream! Huge fan!"}
{"text":"Enough with that drizzle of chocolate sauce already! I know it can be their \"signature\", but honestly speaking as a baker / customer, this gesture just ruined everything and the beauty of the cake and dessert itself.    Their ice-cream is good, but the proportion is very little and unbalance to the whole dish! Crowded seating is not ideal for dessert house or any intimate conversation.  Their coffee is not properly tamped and therefore very inconsistent with taste and weak. (esp during rush hours!)  The only reason they can survive is by picking the right location on Yonge / Finch - high on walking traffic and night life.  But for those who seek for real quality dessert and relaxing ambiance - there are better out there!"}
{"text":"The \"green tea frosty flakes\" is an incredible dessert featuring various authentic flavours! Do it - you won't be disappointed. Latte art was pretty awesome, and service was also great!"}
{"text":"A big disappointment after visiting this place. Green tea ice cream taste horrible. Hope they can improve it."}
{"text":"The ambience is amazing. Very nice, tranquil music and good atmosphere. I had two crepes, both were amazing. Made to order. I will definitely return here. Staff is helpful, polite and friendly."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday, I got the sesame ice cream with the crepe and it was delicious!! My friends got the brownie waffle and the green tea shaved ice. We all enjoyed it and service was pleasant. It is probably not a good idea for a big group but a group of 4 is perfect!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable! Lots of selection for crêpes and service is not too slow either. Their dishes are amazing and well laid out."}
{"text":"I really want to say that I liked this place but I really didn't, which made me feel bad because after seeing many great reviews of this place, I thought it would be better than what I had experienced.  Long story short: Service took a long time, one of the girls acknowledged my raised hand but never came back to help me get the bill. Everybody at the counter was too busy making food and never bothered to look up. I got a Green Tea Frappe and a Hazelnut Mousse cake. The drink wasn't blended that well and so half of my drink was a chunk of ice. The nuts on top of the cake were definitely not fresh because when I bit into it, I experienced a hard-to-bite somewhat chewy texture instead of the typical basic nutty crunch."}
{"text":"Before I start talking about the food, this is the cutest place ever *-* it's not exactly big, but the space is so well decorated, and everything is so pretty and the staff are so nice and ARGH I CAN'T EVEN.  anyways. onto the foooood  the menu is pretty small, and everything on it is around $8-10 dollars.my mom and I split a savoury one first (mushroom). It was filled to the brim with mushroom and swiss, but it could've used more salt and texture. Like everything was soft and squishy - the crepe, the mushrooms, etc. I mean it was good, just not excellent. it also came with a side salad that was dressed simply with oil and vinegar, a really nice touch.  then we got the black sesame crepe for dessert, and let me just say, the ice cream is KILLER. you can taste the homemadeness of it. the whole thing was sprinkled with roasted peanuts and toasted oats (kinda like granola) that added crunch. it was fairly big, pretty damn good, and the presentation was frickin sexy.  i'll definitely be back, but maybe next time I'll only go the dessert route."}
{"text":"Tasty crêpes..but not amazing...there is something \"weird\" about their texture of crêpes. .but pretty average in Toronto"}
{"text":"Literally my FAVOURITE place for crêpes in Toronto. I've been coming here for a year now and this place does not disappoint. The service is great, the waitresses are friendly. The crêpes and cakes are the perfect texture and sweetness (Try the shortcake or brownie crêpe, it's my favourite). However, it can get a bit crowed from 4-5 when everyone goes for dinner. Still worth the hour long commute from up north.   If you get there between 12pm-5pm on Tuesday to Fridays, you can get the lunch special including a drink and a crêpe for $10.99."}
{"text":"We came here with our baby and was blown away with their amazing crepes. Like any Asian desserts, theirs are not overly sweet (which scores major points in our books!).   Love the attentive service and the cozy ambience too. Wish they had a baby chair though but that's still not a major drawback. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"My favourite crepe/waffle dessert spot! Their ice cream, especially the home made flavours are so rich in flavour! Pistachio and green tea are highly recommended. My friends love the sesame flavour. Must try! Oh and their savoury crepes are really delicious too!"}
{"text":"Great ambience, friendly staff and yummy dessert crepes! Will definitely be back again :)"}
{"text":"Yummy desserts, good service, wide selection on menu, nice presentations. We tried the short cake waffle, Afogato, different lattes, all very good."}
{"text":"One of the tastiest waffles in Toronto! I love the shortcake waffle with strawberries, blueberries, and little shortcake pieces. I came here specifically to get a hot chocolate with a hello kitty-sprinkled face on it and it was so worth it! PS you should come here early-ish, as this place tends to get crowded after 8:30/9pm, even on weekdays!"}
{"text":"I live right upstairs from this dessert house, so I may be a little biased. I walk past their store everyday when going to Finch station (it's only a little south of the station).   I had a sesame ice cream crepe, you can substitute the crepe with waffle for $1. To say the least, it was the best crepe I ever had! I felt like a fat-ass afterwards, but I was tempted to try their pumpkin latte, which was so-so.   It's a small store that can only fit up to 20 people, but the ambiance is casual and lighting was bright. You can choose to sit outside on the patio, but it was full so I sat inside. The crowd inside was mature, mostly couples on dates or business people talking over a cup of coffee.   I will definitely be back considering how close it is from home!"}
{"text":"Would be five stars if their place was bigger. Expect to wait 10-20 minutes for a table -- keyword \"wait\". Yes, their desserts are worth the wait. Delicious! Also, their service is great."}
{"text":"Stop being sold out of green tea ice cream!!!!  (angry face)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for sweet crepes. I've had the sweet potato, roasted matcha, and the tropical and all 3 were really good. I don't think you can go wrong with any choice off the sweet crepe menu. I love their little patio during summer time, a really nice place to chill with one or 2 other people. Seating gets tight for large groups. Really recommend!!"}
{"text":"I do believe Pastel serves THE best crepes in the GTA.  Not dry or crispy but perfectly soft and chewy filled with fresh toppings and cream. You can tell they put a lot of heart in each bite you take. They also serve the best decaf latte in the area!"}
{"text":"Visited here on November 21 for crepes and coffee. Had a white hot chocolate. Presentation was beautiful with a cocoa heart on top and ate the banana Nutella crepe. It was delicious. The chocolate ice cream on the side was amazing. My husband had a peppermint latte and the fruit parfait, which he really enjoyed. This is a great little place for a get together with friends. Will definitely go back to try the savoury crepes."}
{"text":"I was here on a friday evening and the place was crowded. We ordered a crepe with green-tea ice-cream and a waffle with black sesame ice cream. The quality of crepe and waffle was not the best; it didn't taste fresh, the waffle was soggy. I really liked their black sesame ice cream! The service was pretty fast considering the place was full."}
{"text":"Their dessert crepes are pretty decent but their service is WORST TO NONE!!!!!  My wife called them at 9:50 pm to check and see when they are close and if there are any seats available, the person said they close at 11 and come on by.  Got there in 15 mins and then they told us \"sorry, we r close at 11 (which is 50 mins away), you can order from the takeout menu if u like\".  Enough said."}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to this place and the desserts here are awesome. We tried the nutella crepe, raspberry tart and dark chocolate mousse. All were excellent and the ice-cream served with the crepe was really good."}
{"text":"Pastel always make delicious crepes if you are a crepe lover like myself. They offer savoury and sweet crepes. If you're not a crepe lover; waffles option is also available. I personally love the dessert style. Their menu is decent as they offer different coffees, lattes, and other choices of desserts.  I particularly enjoyed pastel crepes for their Asian flavour selections such as black sesame, matcha, red bean and more. My friends and I all ordered the black sesame crepe/waffle and it was delicious! Honestly, I was already full from dinner prior going for crepe dessert but I was still able to finish it (it was that yummy). I love how portions were generous, crepes were thin to my liking, and it was not super sweet.   Moreover, their customer service was excellent. They were accommodating even though the restaurant is so small. Staffs were attentive as they kept offering to refill our water. They were also super friendly and warm.   Only downfall to this place I would say is definitely parking. I read from other reviews that there are parking behind within the condo but I never bothered with that myself. Street parking is the way to go but it may get stressful and hectic if you come here during peek times of business hours."}
{"text":"Drove by and thought I'd pop in to see what it's like.  Inside, it's small and a bit squeezed. But I found the waiters pleasant the desserts great.  The cream is real, whipped. The cake tasted fresh. They make the crepes right in front of you, shortly after you put in your order.  Ingredients such as nuts, chocolate and cocoa powder are wholesome and fresh.  Service was slow and a bit absent-minded (forgot half our order), but it could've been one of those \"off nights\".  All in all, I hope to return and try their other dessert options."}
{"text":"I ordered the sweet potato crepe because it sounded interesting but unfortunately it tasted ONE NOTE. I ate about 1/4 of it had enough sweet potato purée, thanks. They need to add some fruits to this because it's boring AF to eat, no variety or texture to the dish. On the bright side, I liked the sweet potato ice cream and my friend's turkey crepe was good.  Fyi: Don't order the sweet potato latte, it's weird. It's white and looks kind of like congee. It has a weird consistency that makes you feels like you're drinking potato soup. Would not recommend, I mean, unless you're into that."}
{"text":"Pass by so many times. Finally able to sit down and try their crepes. It is not a big cafe but I feel very comfortable sitting at a table and waiting for my order, Military Latte & Premium Matcha Crepe, to come listening to the Jazz music  it's playing. Feel relaxing .  Military Latte (score 5/5) The latte tastes good. I could taste both the matcha  flavour and the tea  flavour. They are both equally present in the drink. Pretty good! I should say, it is actually better than GOOD!!   Premium Matcha Crepe (score 4.5/5) Almost everything on the plate is GREEN. The presentation is elegant. I believe there are three pieces of crepes (in green). They are folded in several layers in triangular shape with some mochi, red beans in red bean sauce, whipped cream (in green) and two scoops of matcha ice cream on the side. The matcha does not taste too strong in the crepes or in the ice cream but it's just good enough for the taste. The only   thing I want to express is it's a bit too expensive, $14.99. The menu also has other non-sweet crepes. I would want to come back to try another kind of crepes."}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to take a look at this dessert cafe. First impression was good , it was very cute and had a nice selection. Honestly ive been to a few dessert cafes and i got to say this is my top 5. They have really good crepes and the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Best creperie in Toronto in my opinion. Been coming here for 4 years or so. Love the atmosphere the service and their home made ice cream. Matcha is really great!!"}
{"text":"Space is a bit small, however they totally worth your visit. Friendly service and delicious desserts. Everything is never overly sweet which is my liking."}
{"text":"Ive noticed a lot of places like this in the yonge and finch area. As far as the food goes, I really cannot imagine each being drastically different from the other.  The waffle with chocolate bananas and ice cream tasted exactly as i expected it to. Absolutely no surprises. How much can a dessert disappoint really? Prices were ok. Coffee was so so. I'd probably go back once I've tried every other similar place in the area as the cycle restarts."}
{"text":"Had a good dessert time tonight catching up with a friend. Small shop, few tables inside and outside.  We sat inside and was greeted instantly with waters to start with. The menus are a bit dirty and old. I opted for the green tea red bean crepe with a Matcha white chocolate. Both were good, not great.  I would order again the matcha white chocolate but probably try something else to eat next time.  Matcha white chocolate I found to be unique, sweet and flavourful... However it did stain my lips for some reason.  The green tea crepe was mediocre, good crepe, good ice cream, red bean on par. Nothing too interesting to note. Their service was good, refilled our waters. We sat and chatted for around 2.5 hours. I believe they do have a limit to 2 hour seating on weekends. They were nice enough to split our bills."}
{"text":"green tea crepe  kinda pricey good green tea flavour good to share"}
{"text":"From the artistic pictures of crepes and lattes that always pop up on my Instagram newsfeed, I HAD to find out what that place was.  I've been to pastel three times and left satisfied each time. It's a small café at finch and young with seats outside which is perfect during summer. I recommend going there on weekdays because they have a lunch special : ( savoury or desert crepes with a latte for only around 10.99+ salad )   Service is always good, and the food is even better. I don't have much places to compare Pastel to, but the crepes are made so so nicely. Flavours go amazing together and you'll never have a problem with a soggy crepe.  They have large portions and the crepes always comes with a side ( salad , ice cream (!!!) etc) Their lattes are also very delicious with cute latte art on them.   Try it out !"}
{"text":"I came to Pastel during a double date with a couple friends and it was really fun. The place is small and cozy and they have a lot of variety in the menu (at least for a dessert place). I ordered a latte and a shortcake waffle. I thought the waffle was really good. It was around 12$ if I remember correctly. I really do recommend this place if you decide to splurge on a waffle and a latte. Their food is a treat!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for dessert! I always order the black sesame waffle :) Note that you have to spend minimum $5 per person at your table! (So if your table has 3 people, your bill must be minimum $15)"}
{"text":"I love Pastel! It's my go-to cafe in North York, and a great place for when I feel like spending some quality one-on-one time with friends. If you're important to me, chances are I've brought you here.  The cafe is small, cozy, and clean. My personal favourites are their smooth lattes and the brownie crepe. You get two scoops of the same flavour ice cream with your crepe, but you can always ask for different flavours.  I love their coffee + crepe/waffle special, and the cute chalkboard sign they leave outside in the summer. It's also nice to sit outside in the summer when they open their outdoor patio space.  A huge plus is that they're open late, so Pastel is always there to satisfy your nighttime sugar craving.   The staff is always changing so there are no familiar faces, but everyone is always really friendly and smiling.  A few things though (and I'm saying this cause I love you, Pastel!):   The fact that they're a cafe and use teabags is kind of embarrassing. I don't need to pay over $3.00 for a cup of hot water and a teabag.  They also need to put their Christmas decorations away, which they keep all year round. The nutcrackers are cute, but when you're there in the summer, it's weird.  I think they also need to finally retire their second menu which is made like a photo album. It's outdated, and nobody takes the time to fully go through it.  Finally, please stop using fake flowers out on the patio. It cheapens the place."}
{"text":"This is a place mostly for IG worthy food photos and catching up with a friend. It's situated near Yonge Finch so competition is high for these dessert cafes. It's small, brightly lit, simple and clean.   My friend ordered a chicken crepe which came with a salad. The crepe was quite delicious...a lot of mushroom and chicken in a rich creamy white sauce. It was also grilled on either side. The dessert crepes on the other hand were way too sweet for my liking. I ordered the sweet potato one and with the maple syrup and ice cream (supposedly home made and should taste like sweet potato but didnt)...I couldn't finish it. Lastly, I got a hot sweet potato latte. This was very good...tastes exactly like blended sweet potato..thick and rich in flavour. The portion sizes were big as well. I couldve just ordered the latte and I wouldve been more satisfied.  There's so much similar places nearby that I've yet to try. It's questionable whether I'd come here again until then."}
{"text":"I came here a year ago and it wasn't that good because I ordered their cake - but this time thanks to the recommendation of many I got the crepe. And it was amazing! I got the black sesame crepe and it was probably the best crepe I've had in my life. Try it out. Holy crap. I got green matcha latte and it was good too. But I recommend trying their asian flavoured crepes and ice creams. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This place was so good!! The service was great! Even though it was tiny it was well lit and it was cute modern. The workers were nice and friendly. The food was great but very sweet so if you have a sweet tooth this is the place to go! The place are large so if you get full easily then you might want to share. The plates are nicely done thought."}
{"text":"A little on the pricier side. Their homemade purple sweet potato ice cream honestly didn't taste much like purple sweet potato. I've had actual purple sweet potato and ice cream flavored as such, and it did not taste like either."}
{"text":"This dessert place is very lovely :), I would give more stars if I could! The menu is pretty versatile, though it is the typical dessert selection you can find almost anywhere (but I didn't come here for something new anyways haha). I had the Nutella and banana crepe and it was delicious and very nicely designed. I like that Pastel puts in effort to make their dishes look good. Atmosphere and service is good. Next time I go, I will try out their specialty cakes and lattes!"}
{"text":"We ordered a slice of white chocolate blueberry cheesecake ($6.99) and added two scoops of ice-cream (add $2.60), one scoop of home made green-tea ice-cream (add $0.75) and one scoop of cookies and cream. We also ordered a regular sized hot chocolate ($3.99) to meet their minimum sitting fee of $6 per person before tax.   Food: the cheesecake was nice, although in my opinion could've had a tastier crust and there was too much whip cream on it. The ice cream on the other hand in particular their home made green tea flavour was pleasant as I absolutely love the dark matcha taste. The cookies and cream one tasted quite average to be honest. I regret drinking my hot chocolate after having cake and ice cream as that may have skewed my taste buds. The art on top was cute however was not centered to satisfy my slightly OCD self, and it really just tasted like milk possibly because the ice cream and cake were much sweeter.   Verdict: this was a nice cosy dessert cafe and I do enjoy supporting local small businesses. I would consider coming back again as their location is more convenient than Rahier bakery (where a couple of their specialty cakes come from) and I love their cakes.   Tips:  1. maximum seating time is 2 hours.  2. House made flavours are sesame, green tea, sweet potato and pistachio."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, clean restaurant, cozy feel. Most importantly the crepes are awesome. Ordered the shortcake crepe. Ice cream was not too sweet, crepe filling was delicious with bits of cake, berries and whipped cream. all the while not overly heavy. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Nice cute shop on Yonge! Didn't know a sweet thing like this was around here but glad to have found it!  Been here a few days ago and it was a nice place. The interior is quite small so it is definitely not meant for groups. Max group size i would suggest is 4 and thats not exactly a group but close enough! Not very spacious either as you have 3/4s of the tables lined up against one side and 2 tables lined up against the counter where they serve and make drinks/food.  I ordered the Mushroom Crepe while my friend had the Ham Crepe. Both were quite delicious and the crepe was very fresh! The only thing I have to say was the sauce used to smother the mushrooms were a little on the salty side and mind you, I love salty food but this was a bit more than I can handle! That aside, there was a serving of salad that came with the Savoury Crepes options which was refreshingly nice! They doused it with a bit of Balsamic Vinigrette and the greens were fresh!  For dessert I had the Mixed Fruit Ice Cream Parfait and my friend had the Creme Brulee! Honestly I really enjoyed my parfait and the whipped cream was the perfect amount! There wasnt a ton sprayed in between thankfully but had I known it was gonna be in there I would have opted to have it whipped cream-less. I can't comment on the Creme Brulee because I didn't taste it but my friend did mention that it didn't have that crispy sweet layer on top.  Overall, everything tasted great and I would definitely return to try their other items on the menu and would recommend it as a date spot since it had this cozy, personal feel to it and it isn't meant for large groups. Plus theres the comfy booth seats!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday night with a party of 8 and they were able to accommodate us in their cute and quaint space. I shared the matcha green tea crepe with my friend and we both thought it was really delicious! The crepe was filled with whipped cream and sponge cake and drizzled with chocolate and had two scoops of matcha green tea ice cream on the side. This is my second time here and both times did not disappoint. They also has savoury crepes, waffle options, cakes, and parfaits. Would recommend this place if you're around the area and want a quick sweet tooth fix!"}
{"text":"Pastel is nestled among the commercial buildings along Yonge St, and can easily be overlooked among the dozens of bubble tea shop and cafe there, but I encourage you to go in a try their coffee and crepe. I've been to this place quite a few times, and ordered a different item each time, and I can't say I was ever disappointed.  The crepes and waffles are always beautifully presented, and their coffee is up to par. The only thing I didn't like was their flavoured coffee, which strikes no particular significance to me, the flavours are quite mild and sometimes hard to tell if you're really drinking the flavour you ordered. However, their lattes are always great, with comes with beautiful foam design.  What impresses me most is the customer service. The waiters are always attentive to your needs and comes to fill your glass up with water without you asking. Most importantly, they never try to kick you out, even during busy hours.  Overall, a great place to go for a small group of friends."}
{"text":"I have been here twice ans both times were merely average.  I was really disappointed that the Belgian waffles were soft and a bit doggy instead of being nice and crisp.  The crepes do appear to be a bit better and the ice cream dish that looked like leaves of lettuce was pretty good."}
{"text":"What I enjoy the most about this place is the peacefulness of it. I didn't order any food here so I can't comment on the crepes. I did get a marshmallow latte, and my boyfriend got a hot chocolate. Overall I think we got our money's worth. It came in a big cup, with latte art and all. Though admittedly my latte didn't have the marshmallow flavour it promised, it was still yummy nonetheless. Service is also good. My boyfriend and I spent like an hour and a half there playing cards, despite only ordering two drinks, and we never got any dirty looks from the staff for doing so. Overall comfy atmosphere that I'd love to return to. However, I've walked by it at night and it does get really busy, so something to keep in my mind."}
{"text":"Really good crepes! Had the green tea and black sesame ones. The drinks were pretty but tastes ok. The foams on top of the drinks were nice and thick!"}
{"text":"Pastel is a cute, small cafe that's perfect for conversing with friends over delicious dessert.  Brownie crepe - brownie bits, bananas, and cookies and cream ice cream. This was quite possibly the best crepe I've ever had, and I won't hesitate to order this the next time I'm here! I might be biased just because I adore brownies.  Frozen white chocolate - I found it to be on the sweeter side but this is most likely because I had the crepe paired with it. I would rather try something else on the menu.  Will definitely be back if I'm ever in the area!"}
{"text":"First time being here after a little self-discovery and I was not disappointed in the least. I tried the brownie dessert crepe and it was soooo good. The ice cream on the side had brownie pieces and it was so tasty I would go back just for that. Really great presentation and good service too. The area is quite small but it's quaint. Not ideal for big groups but definitely good for a couple. Free underground parking too just around the corner which is nice if you're driving as you would pay to park on Yonge street. Lattes look amazing-that's next on my list! Definitely a must-try dessert place."}
{"text":"Small cute little shop. Upon entrance you can see some desserts and a menu in case you are waiting for a seat. Upon seating you're greeted with water right away.   We got Verne brûlée, raspberry tart and green tea shaved ice. All were amazing. The presentation of the food is beautiful.   The green tea shaved Ice is so light and just melts.    The crime brûlée was just the right amount of sweetness and lightness.  The raspberry tart was full of awesome and raspberries.   Each table also has the wifi password written on them which was super helpful.   All in all this place is small and gets busy quick but service is great, friendly and fast. I would definitely be back here again to try different desserts."}
{"text":"There's always room for dessert!   As a huge matcha/green tea anything fan, I opted to share the green tea dessert crepe (red bean, sponge cake, green tea ice cream). This was lighter than expected and the sponge cake was nice and soft. The balance with the red bean and the ice cream was delightful!   The place was busy and as soon as tables left, new parties would come in and fill in the tables. We came at an earlier time so it wasn't super packed and there was no wait but I'm sure it's quite busy later in the night (9pm onwards).  I will most likely be back to try some of the lattes and other crepes :)"}
{"text":"I think this is a convenient place if you live in the area and wanted crepes.  Their crepes are pretty good but I still prefer Demetres. I was recommended to this place by someone else and I guess my expectations are way high because of all the rave reviews but for the same price, the crepes are just crepes.  Nothing too special.  As someone who doesn't live in the area, I probably would not drive to yonge and Finch, try to find parking or pay for parking to eat these crepes."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for the bundle of goodness known as the black sesame crepe. The \"homemade\" ice cream is just right -- captures the essence of sesame and is not too sweet. The sprinkling of cereal is a creative touch to the dish, adding nice texture. Fortunately (for me), there isn't much sponge cake inside the crepe, as this would make it too filling. If I could critique one thing, it would be the abundance of whipped cream. Most people could probably live with this. Overall, the crepe strikes a delightful balance of flavour, texture and presentation.   Brownie points go to the servers - who are very friendly and accommodating. My friend paid with credit card, and our server was more than happy to entertain my request to break a $50 bill. Another server was accommodating enough to serve some customers who chose to sit out on the patio on quite a chilly autumn day. And she did it with a smile!"}
{"text":"Super cute place for a date. It's on the expensive side but totally worth it. They have creative decorative lates and fair portions of waffles. Their crepes are perfectly cooked and they have many sweet and also gourmet crepe options. service was amazing"}
{"text":"Pretty good service, parking is annoying here though on a busy Saturday night, crepes are fresh, they are not really pipping hot when they come though. Some ice cream is made in house which is impressive, the best I've had is pistachio. When my husband and I went they had a special waffle with lychee, sponge cake pieces, pineapple and coconut, that was one of the best waffles I've ever had but I don't know if it's a regular on their menu.   *If its your first time here: Get chocolate mascarpone crepe and switch the ice cream to something more interesting than french vanilla"}
{"text":"I was in the area after an interview and trying to decide what to eat...(Jeopardy Theme)  Suddenly, I had a memory of home, mom making crepes and us kids, drizzling, spreading, sprinkling, packing them with sweet syrup, chocolate chips, icing sugar, fruit, whip topping. But beyond the breakfast/Dessert crepe from home I have never been to a creperie and always wanted to try a savory type like the one's I have only heard of.   First of all, this place is so bright, clean and organized it puts our hospitals to shame. I think I could have ate my meal off the floor! Ok maybe not that clean but it was looking good and modern. Even the bathroom was super clean and fashionable. And I am actually big on bathrooms and their cleanliness and decor. LOL.  Ok back to the food.   I ordered their lunch special. A choice of one of their select crepes and a choice from a select list of beverages. You can order anything but then you are adding $1 or more for something off their $10.99 deal.   My crepe of choice - Chicken: pieces of chicken breast, spinach, cremini and swiss cheese with a nice savory dressing.  My bevvie - Matcha green tea latte  Crepe - savory. delicious. healthy? I dunno. But the crepe itself was perfect texture, not too egg-y, hint of sweetness, soft, slightly chewy with a thin layer of crispy from the pan.   Latte - AMAZING! Best green tea latte EVA! and first time seeing real latte art! That wowed me big time! I'm sure I am just a newbie to this frothy white and green wonder in my mug, but I would come back just for another one of these!  First creperie I have been to and loved the experience, so this gets 5 stars from me.   There were other desserts and my mouth salivated at the sweet crepe options shown in a little photo album. From latte art to crepe masterpieces!!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I adore desserts and I'm always on the lookout for more places to satisfy my matcha cravings--and this place really hits the spot!  The staff are all super lovely and friendly! They're very attentive and are very keen on filling your glass of water--they seem to be dead set on keeping it completely full.  We ordered the roasted green tea crepe, chocolate crepe, matcha green tea waffle, and shortcake waffle. All of them taste amazing with lovely ice cream flavours. The roasted green tea crepe set was unique to me since I haven't seen the roasted version anywhere before. It tasted amazing for anyone who's looking for a less sugary dessert. The side of brown sugar syrup is there for your sugar needs, but I enjoy it without. The chocolate crepe is filled with mascarpone whipped cream and some strawberries. It's quite filing with a vanilla bean ice cream that has a taste somewhat reminiscent of the signature Häagen-Dazs flavour.  The matcha green tea waffle is a nice fluffy waffle with matcha ice cream and some red bean. It all pairs lovely together and there is no shortage of whipped cream.  The shortcake waffle really hits the nail on the head, but I would love if it came with a *little* bit more strawberries (I love fruit on waffles).  Love this place and would definitely come back again! Desserts are all very filling but are also quite sugary for a lot of the flavours. I prefer slightly less sugary desserts and the roasted green tea hits the spot for me. I can definitely see how the chocolate crepe, for example, may start feeling too sugary toward the end of your dessert--so preceded with caution!"}
{"text":"When I did a quick yelp search for desserts in my hood, I was excited to see some new names pop up. Don't get me wrong, I love me some Maxim cake, but it's been a while (a long LONG while) since we've had some new little shops sprout in the area. I showed up on a weeknight to a bright open-spaced but surprisingly busy place. Luckily, we scored the last table indoors.  Service was quick, they brought over some water and menus. I love when a place has pictures for their menu, but it seems to bring the experience down a notch when the pictures are in a photo album. Regardless, it helped plenty with the decision-making, and I ordered a sesame ice cream crepe, while my brother ordered the napolean cake (called a cream flake cake). He also ordered an earl grey tea.  I thought my crepe was fantastic, I loved the sesame ice cream on the side and inside the crepe. My brother said his cake wasn't very flaky - I guess it may have been sitting in the window too long. He also wanted a refill on his cup of tea (because they simply brought him a cup with a teabag, but the staff became too busy to help us out. We had a hard time getting someone to help us get the bill once we were done too. A shame I had a knock a star off for that, since I loved my food so much.  Overall it was a fun trip and I was totally happy I got to try a new place. I'd go back again to see how the rest of their cakes were (I was in a happy-full state and forgot to order a few to go), but I do hope this place sticks around for a while. And yes, as Ana W says, the bathrooms are clean too!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing little cafe which serve crepes and waffles. Love the new Matcha Premium. There are lots of dessert place on Yonge but this is the one which can keep up the quality and consistency."}
{"text":"We ordered the matcha crepe and matcha shaved ice, which looked absolutely beautiful and gobbled it up in minutes. My favourite was the crepe. It had some cake inside which was a great surprise. The whip cream was absolutely delicious. The homemade matcha ice cream was only ok but that crepe tho!"}
{"text":"They have both sweet and savoury choices. I ordered the matcha crepe which have have been craving for, and my friend ordered nutella one.   We thought it was just dessert portion, turned out that they served two huge plates. My matcha one had red bean and cream in it. I started from the cream side and quickly got bored with it, then I reached to the other side where red beans were all in there...It is suggested that they could have mixed red bean and cream, so that the taste could have been balanced. Maybe next time I'll eat from the middle lol.  The matcha ice cream lighted up the plate, made the taste much better.  The place is small but comfortable, the waitress is nice and cute, she even allowed us to use her iPhone charger :)"}
{"text":"Go to place for crepes! Both their savoury and sweet crepes are delicious. My favourite is either the chicken crepe or the chocolate one. My friend also really enjoys the nuts one. I've only tried their chai latte once and didn't really enjoy it but I'll definitely be trying more drinks in the future."}
{"text":"Came by here with a friend the other day! The place is very cute and very much like its name, had pastel coloured décor. Mind you, I love pastel colours so hands down this is the best café to sit in.  I originally wanted to just sit and catch up with my friend over a cup of tea/coffee. The downside about this place is that you have to order $6+ for dine in. Apparently it wasn't like this before so I was a bit disappointed. Well, because of that, I got the lunch combo which includes a crepe and a drink for $10.99. Pretty great deal imo.  I got the strawberry shortcake crepe and a peppermint latte. The crepe WAS SO GOOD. I loved the presentation and they actually put the whipped cream inside the crepe instead of just the side. Clever, I would say! I don't really have a refined palate for crepes so let's just say it was 5/5 because I thought it tasted great and it almost looked too good to eat.  My latte kinda sucked. THEY FORGOT TO PUT THE PEPPERMINT IN IT. It was just a plain latte and I ordered it for the peppermint...  Ah well. I still had a great time catching with my friend. It's a cute place to chill but keep in mind that you gotta spend $6+ on the menu to dine in!"}
{"text":"They really know what they are doing. Despite the slightly limited selections what's the offers are all very high in quality. They offer crêpe in sweet and savoury, waffles (sweet only) some cake, specialty coffee and tea. They offer items with an Asian twist such as sweet potato latte and matcha crêpe.  My friend ordered the Tropical crêpe which is a crêpe with mixed fruit and pistachio ice cream. The pistachio ice cream is very nutty. I can taste more almond than pistachio in it but it goes with the mixed fruit crape really well.   I order their new item Premium Matcha Crêpe. As a matcha/green tea fan I really like it! Matcha flavour was strong with red bean paste and some mochi. So if you like crêpe and waffles in Asian inspired flavours I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love this little gem! Have been here so many times but it's my first time reviewing!  Muuuuuust have: black sesame crepe! love the ice-cream that comes with it and the sesame filling in the crepe. really really sesame-y! also, plzzz try their sweet potato latte. the foaming is rich and the sweet potato tastes legit. i cant event resist it in hot hot summer LOL. especially when winters coming, drop by and grab a cup of latte. won't disappoint you ;)"}
{"text":"This is a nice spot to hang out and have a coffee and dessert. If you can tolerate dairy. If not, you can sip your limonata and stare impotently at the dairy-filled cakes on everyone else's table and sigh loudly.  I came here with my friend who wanted to just hang out and have a coffee. No problem. It was a really comfortable spot with soft jazz in the background and really clean decor. It had one of the nicest bathrooms I've seen that wasn't in a swanky nightclub.   If you like desserts, you can flip through their little photobook and order something. The crepes smelled good.   I probably won't be back again since I can't have 99% of what's on the menu, but I was pleased that the coffee and limonata came to $4 after tax, which is much less than I expected from such a nice place."}
{"text":"I am so thankful that a few of my Toronto Yelp friends introduced me to this place.  I have been looking for a good Japanese creperie for a long time and can't seem to find one in So Cal.  (If you know one please do let me know!)  MUSHROOM CRÊPE:  The texture of the galette itself was authentically Japanese.  It was thin, soft, slightly chewy, and with a hint of sweetness.  It was filled with a blend of various sliced mushrooms, Swiss cheese, and a delicious cream sauce.  The dish came with a very fresh side salad which was tossed in a yummy Italian style vinaigrette.   BLACK SESAME CRÊPE:  The crêpe was filled with a soft sponge cake and fresh whipped cream; topped with crushed peanuts and cereals; and finally sprinkled with powder sugar. To make this the perfect dessert, it came with two scoops of black sesame ice cream.  The ice cream was a bit coarse in texture which actually let you taste the black sesame in it.  The flavor was rich and memorable.  This is definitely one of my favorite local gems in the GTA.  Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Visited Pastel on a Tuesday evening after dinner. Immediately was impressed with the quant and clean atmosphere at this dessert house. It was pretty quiet and I was seated right away.   The service was amazing. Such a nice server and staff. The menu was accompanied by a book of pictures showcasing all of their dishes. This made picking something alot easier,   I got a Nutella, banana, whipped cream and chocolate ice cream on waffle. It was unbelievable!!!!! $9 and well worth it (big portion)  My Girlfriend got the brownie, banana, whipped cream and vanilla ice cream crepe. Beautiful presentation and even better taste with super tasty dough.   Finally we had an apple tart that was not too sweet and not too salty. Really good but the worst of the three.   Overall everything about this joint, price, service and desserts were amazing and it is a hidden gem in the GTA."}
{"text":"Their cakes are awesome! We often drive from downtown, just to eat there. Have never tried their crapes, though, nor have I dined in there (always grab their cakes to go), but the staff is always friendly and welcoming. Will dine there next time."}
{"text":"The crepes were really good! I enjoyed the lightness and textures. Sometimes I find that crepes are too tough, chewy, or thick, but these were perfect. I ordered the sweet potato crepe and thought the maple syrup, almonds and sweet potato puree  complemented each other well. The only complaint was the icecream. Maybe it's the nature of sweet potato icecream, but I felt that the texture wasn't that smooth and it was a bit icy. Overall this was a fun dessert place with friendly servers and a nice, light atmosphere. This place is busy, but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Very delightful and delicious crepes but it was too much for me. I was not able to finish my dish. We had nutella and banana crepe and also nut crepe. Both were great. I did not like the white hot chocolate, very sweet"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out and I finally decided to come.  The cafe was completely full when I arrived, however, we did not have to wait for a seat.  It was nicely decorated with festive lights and Christmas decor and the smell of the crepes and waffles made my mouth water. I already knew what I was going to order coming in.  We ended up ordering the Sweet Potato Waffle which had sweet potato puree, almond, maple syrup, whipped cream, and house made sweet potato ice cream.  I got mine without the maple syrup.  We also ordered the Coconut Mocha and the Brownie crepe which had banana, brownies, and cookies and cream ice cream. My waffle was delicious, but extremely filling because of the sweet potato puree.  It was a unique flavour that I would have never imagined on a waffle but overall, I wasn't disappointed.  Next time around, I would want definitely want to try the crepe in a different flavour.  The Brownie crepe was also very delicious.  If you like chocolate, I would highly recommend this.  The Coconut Mocha was also very rich and sweet - perfect for someone with a sweet tooth!  Even in the middle of winter, there's always room for dessert and I will happily come revisit Pastel Creperies & Dessert House again!"}
{"text":"Mmm crepes!! Had the sweet potato crepe, and it was delicious. Perfect amount of sweetness (I had asked for the maple syrup on the side but ended up pouring most of it onto the crepe anyway). I tried a bit of my friend's green tea red bean crepe and I wasn't a big fan. It was a bit too sweet and dense for me.  Ordered a black forest latte as well. It was pretty sweet, and served lukewarm. I could probably do without the latte, but would come back for the crepes!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of this adorable little dessert shop since the first time stepping here. They have a binder full of latte selections (Ha), and each one of them is delicious.   They also have a huge awesome selection of dessert cakes and crepes. I remember sharing a nutella ice cream crepe with my friend the first time here and it was amazing.   Seriously, this is an awesome place for a first date!"}
{"text":"Pros: Smoked salmon crape is delicious  Pretty much all their deserts are great!  Latte is always great Service is decent   Cons: Can get very busy depending on the time  Very small space  One washroom"}
{"text":"I came to Pastel with a friend and we shared the matcha green tea ice cream crepe...it was delicious. Between two people (shared), it was incredibly satisfying. The interior space of the cafe is small, with a casual yet classy ambience and maintained in cleanliness. Tables are meant for two or for side tables- groups of four-five max...good place for a small gathering of friends or dessert dates but not a contender for big groups. They also have meat crepe & sandwich options if you want a meal. Price range is standard for cafes - prices range from $5-10+ for desserts and $3-6 for beverages."}
{"text":"I always get the Strawberry Shortcake dessert. Its amazing! You can only chose what kind of ice cream you want. (No charge) originally theres strawberry ice cream there but I don't really like it. I'm more of a chocolate or vanilla kind of person. It's a huge order. We usually share it. The price is $11.99 plus tax. They also have decent cakes and crepes"}
{"text":"I'm so glad it's summer because I want to come back here and eat at the patio :). I came here about a month ago so this review is a little late. It's alllll good.   Decor: It's so cute inside. The decor is just really inviting to me. The paint is green and just makes you wanna order a White Chocolate Green Tea Latte :). They have a nice patio as mentioned above. There are not a lot of tables inside. Parking's a challenge also.   Service: No problems.  Food: I ordered the Chocolate Mascarpone Crepe. The crepe was nice and thickly delicious. The vanilla ice cream with it was probably the best vanilla ice cream I have had! I had a white chocolate green tea latte as my drink and it perfectly matched my dessert.   I'm due to go back :)"}
{"text":"Been to Pastel a few times but first to have lunch here.  I went with a colleague for the lunch special and it was a wonderful deal.  For $10.99, you get to pick a crepe (mushroom, chicken, frankfurter, and ham - other options on the menu for $1.50 extra) and a hot beverage (a wide list to choose from).  We both enjoyed the food and drink a lot. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Located on the busy strip of yonge street between finch and sheppard. Came in on a friday night and it was busy! generally there will be a line and wait to get a table, but the turn around is quite fast. Caters mostly to desserts but does have salty crepes available as well. We tried a couple of items, the sesame crepe, the matcha red bean waffle, and the warm lava set.   Waitress was attentive and was always there to refill your water. Ordering is quick and easy and they're great at providing recommendations.   The sesame crepe was delicious. They said their ice cream is made in house and it had a distinct sesame flavour. The crepe itself was thin but wished it was a little more crispy. Only down fall to this dish was that their was a little too much whip cream for my liking. The matcha redbean waffle was super delicious and had a strong matcha flavour ice cream. Both the crepe and waffle are definitely good sharing dessert dishes.  The lava cake was warm and had oozing chocolate coming out when cut in the centre, served with whip cream and vanilla ice cream.  Overall it was an enjoyable experience. Everything was great and service was good. They also take cash, credit or debit."}
{"text":"I admit that I went in because I saw the sticker on the door \"people like us on yelp\":)   I ordered hazelnut latte, very rich foam, although instead of hazelnut, it has a caramel taste to me, but i loved it. Love the cream flake cake, just to me the \"top\" part (whatever it called), should be crispy rather than chewy. Kinda disappointed,   In general a great place to spend some time with friends or just by yourself~ Added it in to one of my regular spots    Yelpper love it for a reason :)"}
{"text":"E has always been telling me about this little café spot and we've never had the chance to go in together, because we are usually so full from the meal before - which will be a separate post, heehee.  This little café on Yonge and Finch looks big on the outside, as they do have a patio, however there are only about 3 booths inside as the rest of the space are being taken up by their display and cashier spots. We went around 1-2pm on a weekday, so it was fairly quiet and it was very nice to be in there at that time as me and E chatted about lots of stuff.  As I haven't tried shaved ice at all, we ordered this as E said it was good. Shaved ice was very soft and melts in your mouth very quick, which leaves you wanting for more. The green tea flavoured wasn't too sweet nor bitter and the dessert was a good amount for two people. I really really loved the oreo bits though, the crunch from it gave the dessert more of a texture. As me and E both disliked red bean, that was left untouched LOL...  Along with our dessert, we both had ordered drinks in hopes that they would make super cool latte art as last time, E received a Totoro latte art in her hot chocolate when she came here   Sadly, we didn't get any super intense latte art for our drinks, but the service was great and we had a good time there.  It does get very busy when it's after school periods just because it's a nice quiet spot where you can study at and it's slightly off site where most of the restaurants are at the Yonge and Finch area. I would suggest coming at the right time as seatings are very limited in there. Workers are friendly and I'd come here again to try more of their menu :)"}
{"text":"Perfect place for dessert! Located just a few blocks south from Yonge and Finch you will find speciality desserts such as crepes, lattes and pastries. We ordered the crepe with black sesame ice cream and it was delicious. Pair it with a latte and you will be in heaven! Love the unique variety of ice creams they serve. This place gets super busy on a weekend so be prepared to wait 10-15 mins for a table."}
{"text":"Delicious crepes. Endless hot water for tea."}
{"text":"I came here a few times before and it's pretty decent. I always order their sweet potato latte which never disappoints me. This evening, we ordered the green tea crepe and I felt like there was too much whip cream in the crepe than before. I didn't taste any sponge cake at all, but my bf said he tasted a few pieces of the sponge cake. We also got the chocolate oreo parfait, that was alright. Service was meh,there were a few times when we saw the servers chatting, and it was only when I raised my hand that our server came over to us.  Overall, this is a good place to come to hang out at. But probably not somewhere I'd come often."}
{"text":"The door had a sticker proudly saying that people love them on Yelp. So my friend and I decided to confirm that. We surely were not disappointed for doing so! The place is exceptionally clean and tidy. I ordered smoked salmon crepe and she ordered chicken crepe. Both were fresh and tasty. Quiet music playing in the background. Free WiFi. Service is exceptional, staff clearly love working here. Will surely come back for more."}
{"text":"Pastel has officially become my most visited cafe in the area! It is a small cafe that serves desserts like waffle, crepes, sundaes, cake and specialty coffee. There's nothing better than having something sweet after a long gloomy day of work!   This cozy cafe has a few patio seating extending out on to the sidewalk, perfect hangout for a lazy summer afternoon. Top picture is a view of the patio from inside the cafe.   green tea red bean parfait This sundae consists of green tea ice cream, red bean paste, whip cream, green tea mousse, cake pieces and topped with some granola. It wasn't too sweet although there is a lot of cream in the parfait which makes it a really light sundae. However, it did get a little dry in the middle towards the end with the granola and cake pieces after all the ice cream is finished. Nonetheless, the combination of green-tea and red bean  flavors go together extremely well. If you're a fan of green tea, definitely do try it out!  Green tea flaky ice  Milky green tea ice shavings topped with chocolate cookie crumbs and whipped cream. Shaved ice has become a largely popular dessert in recent years and is perfect for a hot summer day. Again this is a very light and fluffy dessert. It is similar to a snow cone except the ice is shaved into very thin pieces, making the texture very smooth and instantly melts in your mouth. This dessert does melt pretty quickly due to its thin slices but nonetheless yummy. Unfortunately this is the only flavor Pastel offers. I really do hope that there'll be more selections in the future =D      On a separate visit, I had the sweet potato crepe which is a newer item on the menu. It's a really simple crepe dish topped with sweet potato ice cream, syrup, icing sugar, almonds and whipped cream. It wasn't very sweet or heavy just like most of their other desserts. You can tell that the sweet potato ice cream is not an artificial flavour. Overall it was a very light dessert dish that I easily finished. The hot chocolate was very rich and creamy as well.  Here's a view of the coffee bar work station. Aside from crepes, waffles and sundaes, Pastel offers a good selection of cakes that is displayed neatly in the pastry fridge. They offer a selection of cakes from various different bakery throughout the town.   This cozy cafe does get crowded later on in the evenings especially during weekends so if you're planning a visit on a Friday evening, be expected to wait in line. Generally Pastel's dessert aren't overly rich, heavy or extremely sweet but they certainly have a lot of unique flavours such as sweet potato, black sesame and taro. I will definitely return again and try out other items on the menu and I'll be sure to update you guys about it!"}
{"text":"Cute little cafe, the crepe was so good. I tried the sweet potato crepe and it wasn't overly sweet. The latte was okay, it was big and aromatic. I'd come back."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and ordered the crepe combo. I've added extra fee to upgrade to a smoked salmon. The crepe tasted pretty good and the combo came with a tea or coffee. A nice relaxing environment. Will come back!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and have had the strawberry shortcake crepe as well as the black sesame crepe. Honestly, the black sesame was a winner for me! Although I like both, the black sesame is always a more interesting flavor to me than strawberry. It was served with ice cream and some chocolate drizzle. I can see that this place can get super busy, but luckily both times I went, it wasn't too bad at all. Service is accomodating and friendly! Great crepe place in North York area. Highly recommend any of the sweet crepes, I really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Cam on a Thurs night, came around 10pm with a friend. Located south of Yonge and Finch, there are street parking around the area.  Food ***** We ordered the black sesame crepe and the mixed fruit parfait. The black sesame ice cream was homemade and tasted great. The parfait also tasted good; both dishes were provided with good portions for the price.  Service **** Service was great, waiter was attentive and always checked by every few moments.  Ambiance **** Pastel was decorated in a cute way and had a friendly vibe inside. They also had an awesome patio which we took advantage of.  Tips/Closing comments - Make sure to try a dessert crepe/waffle with some of their homemade ice cream - Get patio seating if possible - Might be hard to seat groups above 4 due to their limited seating and their popularity"}
{"text":"I had a green tea latte and friend got amaretto mochaccino.  We were too full from lunch and didn't have room to try their crepes or cakes, so can't comment on those.  Our hot drinks were really nicely present, with lovely latte art and all, however, it's a bit too sweet for our taste. We were both expecting our drinks to taste less sugary and more the taste of the names.  Environment is clean and nice for chatting, although I did expect there to be more space between seatings.  So the place is OK, not Starbuck quality drinks, but other components make up for it in being a little place to chill.  Wifi code is on a sign on the table, but I didn't use it.  There is also a minimum spending per customer of $5, so you may have to order the Large size lattes at least. Fair enough if you're going to hang out here for awhile.  Sure, I would consider coming back again to try the desserts."}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to try this place out seeing I was craving crepes.   It's a very very small store, with a simple interior. In the end we got a matcha green tea crepe and a black sesame crepe. They both came at a decent time, and the ice cream was still nice and firm and was not melting quickly. The ice cream was delicious. Then I dug into my crepe, and I was not a fan of it at all. Inside was whipping cream, red bean and small pieces of sponge cake. I didn't like the sponge cake in there at all. It didn't taste like the sponge cakes I usually eat. Something was a bit off about it and that completely ruined the crepe for me.   I definitely won't be back because only the ice cream was good."}
{"text":"Ordered sweet potato crepes, very nice, a bit full for an individual portion, price reasonable."}
{"text":"When people ask me where to have dessert uptown, I immediately whisper pastel.   I whisper bc the place is so tiny I don't want other people to know about it, however I still reveal the name bc the treats here are just too good to not share.  Fresh homemade whipped cream...I remember the first time I came here was almost 6 years ago. A coworker wanted to share (I thank her silently in my head everytime i get to go, still to this day) and she said to me \"Girl, I could drink the whipped cream here\" and I said oh you can have mines. I don't like whipped cream.   She said \"I only like the whipped cream here; you will too.\"  Needless to say, after that experience, sometimes I wake up thinking about the taste of pastels whipped cream -_-   Service is great and food/drinks are so good!! I usually just drink water though because I want as much room in my tummy as possible for the yumminess.  When I meet my friends here, we see other friends...4 people just like us sharing two sweet crepes. And then we look down to all 4 of our individual savoury crepes...bc we are gonna order 4 more sweet crepes for dessert hahaha  I hope pastel stays in business forever. Or at least I want to die first before they go lolll just kidding...sorry That got too dark there.  But seriously, *whispers* go to pastel!  Some suggestions: - frankfurter savoury crepe (just trust me. It's good) - mushroom savoury crepe - all of the sweet crepes are good. (Yes I've tried them all; seasonal specials too!)"}
{"text":"love this premium matcha crepe.  you can really taste the matcha, ice cream is not sweet at all so it may not satisfy your sweet tooth but i like it very much.  thumbs up"}
{"text":"I like coming here for desserts. I love trying the different desserts on their menu. They have many desserts on their menu. I especially love their brown crepes and tuna crepe. Their crepes were very delicious.  I have tried a couple of their drinks, not a fan of it. There was a very bitter after taste. Its a small, little place, but nice, cozy, warm, and friendly atmosphere. Their server are very nice. and friendly. Good place for a date. Yes, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Pastel is a Japanese and French inspired dessert cafe that serve desserts which arent very sweet, basically the opposite of Demetres (some people hate, but i love - hello, sweet indulgence!).  Their lattes have cute art. Their crepes are freshly made. Not sure if they make their own ice cream.  I recommend the black sesame ice cream crepe, it was tastier than the taro/purple sweet potato one which had little taste.  The place is very small so limited seatings while being very popular. Good thing there are several other asian dessert places in this area."}
{"text":"Passed by this place and always wanted to try.    The decor is very kawai but not overtly frivolous.  It's small yet tidy. They also has outdoor seating although being in yonge you wonder about the fume you are taking in.   The service was prompt. I like that there's pictures on some items you can look at.   I had the green tea supreme that comes with green tea ice cream, green tea crepes, whipped cream, red beans and small rice cakes sprinkled with matcha powder. This was very good except that it was too big for one person. I also had the marshmallow latte. I must say it doesn't taste anything special from a regular latte.  While this is a good place, I don't find it exceptional. Good for a catch up with friends but not necessary for me to go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"So I came back to this place after a few years of hiatus and met up with a friend over coffee. They were quite busy. So I got a seat and looked thru their menu. I was very tempted to get a crepe. However, I was full. What is more worse when I was seated right next to the cake fridge... temptation! Haha! I resisted. Anyhow, back to the drinks. I looked at the menu and saw, the Military Latte. I was like... what in the world is that??? Apparently, it is made with condensed milk, matcha green tea powder and espresso. It was a Sunday afternoon, so I asked for a single shot only. This came out not long after and it looked quite nice. Tasted it after, it wasn't overpowering with flavour. I can taste the subtle sweetness of the condensed milk. I tasted the matcha green tea, however I couldn't taste the espresso.   One comment I had is... if you decide to come here, there's visitor parking that is linked to the condo building. However getting to and from the parking can be a bit tedious. Otherwise, this place is great."}
{"text":"Great place for dessert crepes. Very well made and tasty. Small joint though so gets crowded fast"}
{"text":"Love this place.. just the cutest spot for breakfast/brunch or an afternoon/evening delight.. the food is great, the prices are very reasonable and the decor is cute, modern and very clean"}
{"text":"I went to pastels for a late night meet up with a girl friend. The interior is very cute and modern. High ceilings. Service was very attentive, but never intrusive to conversation. Glasses were filled promtly (my main indicator of good service since I am a fish who needs her water).  I ordered the brownie crepes which was pretty good. The crepe itself was properly cooked, good chew and pretty thin. It could have been a bit thinner, but it was acceptable. My main pet peeve with the dish is that there was way too much whipped cream on the plate/in the crepe AND it was definitely not real whipped cream. I could tell by the fake vanilla taste and the fact that it did not melt throughout my meal. It was perfectly intact 30 min later. For an extra buck, I prefer Cafe Demtre or sugar & spice."}
{"text":"The desert here is really good! I'm not a desert person they make it not too sweet on my crepes. Service is excellent."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great date spot. Cozy.  Food wise, I would say on par with other creperies. Their drinks are pretty average. I ordered a chocostrawberry milkshake. It tasted like the borderline of no name triple flavour icecream. You know, when you reach the small strip of strawberry icecream and you get a bit of chocolate. Exactly like that. The crepe had a nice vanilla flavour but the toppings are OK.  My gf got a white hotchocolate but it wasn't sweet enough and the chocolate was faint. However, was cute, had a heart from coco powder."}
{"text":"Service is great. Very friendly and attentive staff. It's limited seating as is everything else on Yonge st. but we didn't wait long for our table and we didn't wait long for our food either. We ordered a waffle and a crepe. Delicious! Great for the price. Waffle wasn't dense. It was nice and hot and fluffy. Lots of fruits and fillings and good portion of ice cream. No complaints!!"}
{"text":"The crepe is a must try at this store. The drink is quite sweet, including both cold and hot drinks. The desserts in the cooler are terrible, looks nice for Instagram pic though."}
{"text":"Great desserts but can be a little pricey. Unless you're going for take out, you're going to have to wait a long time for a table. They can probably only seat less than 30 people in their tiny space, which means tables are very cramped together.  Black sesame ice cream and crepes are my favourite. They have similar specialty drinks from Starbucks like the green tea latte and gingerbread latte. Food comes pretty fast, you can watch them make the crepes as you wait."}
{"text":"5  -  5 Tables 4  -  4 Chairs per Table 3  -  Afternoon Coffee Hour (3 pm) 2  -  Double Cappuccino ($3.59) 1  -  Shortcake Crepe ($7.99)  Question.What's Frosty Flakes? Oh.It's kind of like Shaved Ice. Okay.I'll try when weather's warmer. Thank you."}
{"text":"Came for dessert. Got dessert. Friendly staff and luckily beat the lineup that formed shortly after.   Berry gingerbread latte Tasted berry. Didn't really taste the gingerbread though. Still a good drink to have with a dessert. Will try this drink again and see if I can get one with a stronger gingerbread flavor.   Shortcake waffle Waffle came warm. Cake pieces were lightly sweet. Strawberry and blueberry adds a different kind of sweetness to this dessert. Strawberry ice cream was really good.   Black sesame crepe Perfect crepe filled with peanuts, cake pieces, granola cereal. This is also a pretty good dessert. It's not too sweet. There's a bit of crunch to it. Black sesame ice cream also pretty good."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to eat at this place and I wasn't disappointed! The perfect place to satisfy your sweet tooth"}
{"text":"I have been to Pastels a few times and it has never disappointed me. The desserts are a little on the sweet side, but who doesn't like decadence once in a while ? There's a variety of different flavours you can get on the crepe/waffle menu and they're presented in such an aesthetically pleasing manner - Instagram worthy.  They also have a bunch of cute small cakes and a diverse drink menu that comes with your regular hot beverages like cafe lattes and cold drinks like tropical iced teas etc.  It's a cute, cozy place with very kind and attentive wait staff. They're very cute here and it's definitely a regular place I'd go. Definitely great date place for couples, friends, studying, etc."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I haven't reviewed Pastel yet. Oh my dear Pastel, you are so good I went to you and enjoyed and reveled in your embrace right after I got my teeth cleaned, undoubtedly of all the plaque I got from eating you. Sigh. You are so worth it.   I went to Pastel one day because I wanted crepes and had the sweet potato crepe. I was in love. Forever changed. Like for serious so good. I cannot say that it is not a factor in why I love coming to Toronto. If only I could pick you up and move you to Texarkana...  There is a sweetness to it that is not overwhelmong, and the warmth of the crepes against the cold of the sweet potato ice cream just perfection.  I have tried another crepe, but clearly not memorable. I have also tried the coffe. Also clearly not memorable.  When I go there in 40 hours... Oh maan. I'm already drooling. Do yourself a favor, especially Koreans who spent at least a few years in korea... The flavors will draw you straight home like the rattatouille did to that critic dude I'm the movie Rattatouille."}
{"text":"I always get the Nutella crepe so I can't speak for anything else but they have the best ice cream and whipped cream ever.  The crepes are super filling and very flavourful.  I took some of my hubby's pistachio ice cream and that was absolutely divine"}
{"text":"Cute little cafe with polite staff. One of the only dessert places that will serve you water while you order! I had the lychee and banana crepe which was surprisingly really delicious. The banana ice cream tasted very fresh. There's only street parking though."}
{"text":"This is a really small place with only a couple of tables. Nice and clean, though the decor is confusing (christmas garlands with nutcrackers and fake summer flowers?)  anyway, the service is great, the girl is always standing waiting to serve you, though she didn't understand my question when i asked what type of cakes they have.  I ordered the chocolate mocha ice cream and pistachio cheesecake. i've had better. I don't know how to describe my liking for desserts; I like my flavours to be bold, but the chocolate is a little diluted. The ice cream melted fast too, almost like soft serve :/  the cheesecake... well if you like japanese cheesecakes you'd probably like this one. It's very spongey and airy. No crust, just couple of pistachios here and there, i honestly don't taste anything-no cheese, no pistachio, just... cream? not my kind of cheesecake. nice chocolate designs though.  overall, i find the desserts meh. I'll rather go elsewhere and taste real flavours. i can't quite put my finger on what throws me off about these desserts. The style seems very asian and I don't know if I like it.. what's the main difference between asian and western desserts?"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's great for crepes, dessert and coffee! The cakes they have in display are super delicious. They also serve savoury crepes which I'm going to try next time. They offer free parking in the back condos which is really convenient. Every time I've gone it's been pretty packed. Service is amazing, they always make sure your water is refilled. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had the pumpkin crepe and toasted marshmallow latte. Both items were delicious. The crepe was probably the best I've had in Toronto. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with 2 others. Lunch special: pick from a list of crepes (sweet or savory) and a hot beverage (all other drinks +$1) = $10.99  I opted for chicken crepe with an iced sweet potato latte (+$1). Chicken crepe was filled with mushrooms, spinach and chunks of chicken. Overall was good.  Chicken was a tad dry. Came with a nice spring mix salad. Sweet potato latte was interesting. It actually had sweet potato taste. Not a particularly pretty drink though. Looked and kinda tasted like a sweet potato milkshake. No decoration. My friend's hot chocolate had a cocoa powder Christmas tree on it. They ordered a chocolate crepe. It came with two scoops of vanilla ice cream and chocolate whipped cream on the outside. The chocolate whipped cream was a tad unnecessary, as the inside was predominantly this chocolate whipped cream with a couple slices of strawberries. They felt the amount of strawberries was lacking.  Ambiance: cute cafe. not a very big place.   Service: decent. attentive. willing to split bills.  Total damage for me was $11.99 + tax and tip. Not bad, but not great."}
{"text":"After waiting to come here for the longest time I finally came!! YAY!! When I went in I noticed that there are minimal seating , 6 tables i believe.   It wasnt long before we ordered and we ordered the Pistachio Buttercream Cake and the Green Tea Crepe.   The pistachio buttercream cake was very much like a napolean / opera cake to me for some reason. It was hard to cut into but the butter cream melts in your mouth and obviously it becomes really creamy. Personally I didnt feel like there was enough pistachio taste to it .   The green tea crepe was sooo good! The cake was filled with spongecake , whip cream and red bean. With a dallop of whip cream on the side and 2 scoops with green tea icecream which is homemade. I feel like the green tea icecream was so good, it wasn't like the typical store brought gt icecream cause it wasn't as creamy and i liked how it had the bitterness of the tea which really gave it that homemade taste. The crepe was thin and well made. I can't wait to go back and try more desserts!!!    The service was good the people were friendly and talkative and this waiter gave us opinion on which cake to get since we were torn between the pistachio cheesecake and the pistachio buttercream. They were prompt on refilling our cups with water. It was a nice casual comfy atmosphere. Our total came up to $15 and they have a stamp card for every $10 you get one stamp, after certain amount of stamps you will get a free crepe.   one thing i would've loved to see is that they baked their own cakes but they don't they get it provided from rahier patisserie which was kind of a disappointment for me.   you can always look online for their menu."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered black sesame crepe for $10.99. The crepe was filled with whipped cream and topped with chocolate drizzle and cereals. On the side were the two small scoops of black sesame ice cream. Everything tasted good, but I find it a bit overpriced for a simple crepe dessert like this.  The waitress was friendly, and the place was clean and had a good atmosphere and lighting.  Note that they have a minimum $6 per person policy and a maximum allowable time for dine in is 2 hours."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  The black sesame crepes were really good! They weren't overly sweet like most crepes are. If you're the type that doesn't like overly sweet desserts, Pastel is the place for you! They also have some savoury crepes that looked really good, like the smoked salmon crepe. I like the fact that they have a lot of variety in flavours (like sweet potato and green tea). Staff were friendly and prices were reasonable. Portions were reasonable too - the size that you get is just the right amount for one person to enjoy without getting overly full.   I wish my black sesame crepes was just a tad bit sweeter. I would describe the black sesame crepes' sweetness level as somewhat neutral. I think the ice cream just wasn't as sweet - if the whole thing was just a notch sweeter, it would have been perfect!   Definitely wanna come back to try out their premium green tea crepes and their savoury crepes!"}
{"text":"I have actually been to Pastels on several occasions. I love crepes so I come here a lot, Pastels was where I tried a salty crepe for the first time. I knew they existed but never really tried them. I had the spinach and sun dried tomato crepe it was good but I think I will stay with my sweet crepes which are so much better.   I like the atmosphere mainly because I know the people by first name now. They are very friendly and always have what I like ready to serve. I have sat in Pastels for hours with some friends and had a great time.   #30daysofYelp"}
{"text":"i have wanted to visit pastel creperie for years and years and i finally got to go this summer! living on the west coast is a shame when we are missing out on a gem like pastel creperie. this adorable cafe in toronto is full of delicious dessert based drinks and foods, as well as other common cafe beverages. the way it's plated makes for an adorable photo and a perfect memory. very pleased with my visit and i can't wait to come back! p.s: the waffles are so fluffy, completely superb! ~"}
{"text":"Ordered the shortcake strawberry crepe. It was a whipped cream filled crepe with blueberries and strawberries inside with a chocolate drizzle on top. The crepe exterior was fresh and chewy and the whipped cream was a perfect complement to the fruits. The crepe came with two generous scoops of strawberry ice cream but tasted abnormally sweet. The portions were perfect to share as there were two scoops of ice cream! All in all, a 4/5 experience.  Pro tip: master card and visa accepted over $10!"}
{"text":"The waitress is so nice to serve. The atmosphere is good for having a rest. The waffle and shortcake are tasty."}
{"text":"Nice cozy cafe for crepes, waffles, and pastries. We ordered mushroom crepes, sweet potato waffle, and Nuts crepes. Icecream on the crepes is homemade, very yummy. We ordered cafe lattes, which come along with beautiful latte art. Very detailed for drinks.   *parking is free at underground, but it is kinda hard to find it at first."}
{"text":"I had the tropical crêpe and my husband had the Nutella waffles. Good flavours, not overly sweet, and both the crêpe and waffles had good texture. The house-made pistacio almond ice-cream that comes with the tropical crêpe is delcious. My only thing is that there is just too much whipped cream, which I am not a huge fan of. They have a $6/person minimum and maximum 2 hrs of sitting time. Servers are nice and polite."}
{"text":"It's quite hard to find a good place where you can enjoy nice coffees and desserts.  To be honest, I\"m tired of the bubble tea places as they tend to all taste the same.  Also, dessert places in uptown such as Demetre is so overrated.  If you want to find a dessert dessert/coffee place in uptown.  I would highly recommend this one.  This place is very small but nicely decorated (lots of green!), it gives you a true coffee house experience.  If you are trying to bring your \"special\" friend to somewhere nice and a place where you can talk, this place is for you.  Food wise, I highly recommend their crepes (dessert or hot) and a cup of their lattes.  I would not recommend trying their cakes because they order them from elsewhere, which to me, is not special enough.  Up to this date, I occasionally come here to enjoy a cup of coffee and chill with some friends."}
{"text":"Their lychee crepe was so bomb!! It was loaded with fresh cream and lychee flesh, sprinkled with coconut chips and sugar powder, and came with two scoops or banana ice cream. It was so good that we wanted to try something else. So we asked for a sweet potato crepe. Inside was sweet potato puree, drizzled with maple syrup, and came with house made sweet potato ice cream. Sweet potato ice cream was disappointing because we just could not taste any sweet potato in it. There was a bit of creamy and chunky texture to it, but nothing special. It makes sense to not have a strong sweet potato flavour if they don't put any artificial flavour. But I would never enjoy having something that does not have any taste to it.   Super friendly service, nice ambience, reasonable price.  Overall, I highly recommend their lychee crepe. I would say sweet potato crepe is not as good as lychee. But because you don't see a sweet potato crepe anywhere else, It could be worth a try if you are curious."}
{"text":"Food always good. Ordered Nutella crepe and Nutty chocolate. Both were great desserts. Only thing I would like the crepe to be a bit more crispy."}
{"text":"Really nice little place. Really clean and friendly staff. Crepes are really delicious specially chocolate crepe. Latte and cappuccino was good, maybe not the best but nicely decorated and taste ok. My iced latte was really good. Should try this place for the crepes and waffles"}
{"text":"None of the creperies that i've been to can compare w/ pastel. It's in a league of its own. Their crepes & waffles are perfectly chewy; not too dense/ thick yet strong enough to hold its filling. Some of the ice-creams (sesame, green tea, almond pistachio) are also homemade, giving it a strong prominent flavor. I havent tasted anything as sesame-ish as their sesame ice-cream.  If you go before 5pm, there's a combo deal of $11.99 for a crepe+ drink. The side ice-creams can also be swapped at an extra cost."}
{"text":"I came with a few friends on a late Saturday night for the first time and it was quite busy. I didn't expect such a small Cafe for some reason although I have walked by a few times.   We were a table of 5 and they had more seating for 4 people.  I thought they would give us a 4 person table and just pull up a chair but instead they suggested for me to wait... A Lil disappointing but luckily there was another table leaving and I was waiting for my friends to arrive.  We got water and menus quickly so service was pretty good I'd say.   My fiancée didn't feel like dessert so my friend and I decided to share a waffle- sweet potato waffle.  My other friends opted for the shortcake crepe with strawberry ice cream.  Our items were served quickly and to my surprise the sweet potato waffle was so yummy.  I'm not a huge fan of sweet potato mash but they had just the right amount of sweet potato mash on the waffles and the waffle texture was so fluffy and good.  I loved every bite of it!!!  The sweet purple potato ice cream was not too good as all of my friends said it barely had any taste.  I would recommend substituting that for something else.  One other thing to mention is that they do have a selection of coffee and lattes but unfortunately they only have milk and no other diary substitutes.  Hope to return one day to have that option and also try the yummy cakes and other crepes and waffles."}
{"text":"Coming here after Kinka (Formerly GUU) we decided to catch some dessert locally since we were in Willowdale area.   Up the road along Yonge, passed Empress Walk plaza and Symposium there's rows upon rows of cafes.  We both came across Pastel Creperies. Upon entering the venue, its brightly lit up, organized and most of all clean. When it came to ordering, our lovely server who was polite recommended their Crepes.  Most notably we opted for their decadent Red bean filled crepe that was served with two scoops of Green tea ice cream.   Presentation was bang on and their prices are reasonable, $12 per crepe.   The portions are more than enough for two, however since my counterpart was full I ended up pigging out and finishing the dish lol.  If you're looking for Crepes in the Yonge and Sheppard area, I'd recommend you to try this place as it's a break from your mainstream Demetre or Symposium cafes that are nearby."}
{"text":"Their green tea ice cream with crepes are the signature of this place. No matter how many times i went to this place i only order this. Its not too sweet.  Its just a perfect amount of sugar. Best way to get diabetes hahaahaha"}
{"text":"I love Pastel. My favourite dessert to order here is their black sesame icecream crepe. So good. They are quite pricey however, and have only limited tables. I come once in a while when I have an icecream crepe craving. One of the better dessert places for Crepes in North York for sure."}
{"text":"If youre in the mood for waffles or a crepe then this is the place. I came from America, and wanted to try this place out because of many recommendations. I ordered the Shortcake crepe and Green Tea latte. Both were great, the latte could have been a little sweeter though. There is very limited seating in here. I had to move a table over due to more people coming in for then to do a table merge. Service is great, and the atmosphere is very relaxing."}
{"text":"Pastel Creperie has unbelievably great service, with decent desserts and drinks.  I've had hot chocolate, tea and cakes here but I've never tried the crepes, so I unfortunately can't comment on them. The cakes could definitely be improved in terms of flavour, but they look incredibly scrumptious so the appearance threw me off.   They might want to think about sourcing some macarons or specialty churros to add a bit more variety to individual cakes and crepes.   This is definitely a place I could return to with a larger group of girlfriends, oddly enough despite the romantic-y vibe."}
{"text":"So after reading all the reviews and looks like the average is a 4*, I decided to come here and try things out...it was a little bit difficult to find because on Yonge its really busy and parking was not the easiest thing in the world..It's a small dessert house with maybe 20 seats in TOTAL. Space is limited and a little tight for the average person..=P  We ended up ordering crepes, matcha tea and another special tea that you don't normally see elsewhere...we were overall very impressed with the service and food quality..  The downfall for this is mainly the parking as there is only street parking on busy Yonge St. It's a warm and cozy place and we felt very welcomed...  All in all, a place I can't wait to come back..=D"}
{"text":"In an area lined with numerous eateries and bars, where one's appetites can be satisfied and savour within a short walking distance - this establishment truly adds to the eclectic tastes available for all to enjoy!  I've been here twice in the past, and have sampled their crepes and chocolate mousse.  The crepes are made in-house in front of you in the open kitchen as it should be, and are wonderfully prepared to be enjoyed. Light and fluffy, topped with chocolate ice cream and beautifully presented.  A hot, bitter coffee compliments this sweet dessert.    Also great is their milk chocolate mousse, smooth and creamy - its consistency is perfect. Definitely my favourite. It's hard to miss this dessert as its sits right in front view upon entering this establishment along with many other desserts.  I want to try it all!    They also do weekly if not monthly specials. A different concoction of experiment of sorts.  For this visit, my friend had a sweet potato waffle with also sweet potato ice cream.  I was pleasantly surprised that it turned out pretty well, despite the fact that I was expecting them to use sweet potato batter for the waffles, when in reality, the sweet potato mush was spread onto the regular waffle instead.  Still, both had a nice, sweet taste and worth trying at least once for more adventurous diners looking to try something different!  Be wary though that this is a small sit-down establishment, so on busier nights, you may have to wait awhile.  Do take advantage of the free underground parking that you can enter through the back on Doris avenue."}
{"text":"Yum!  My girlfriends and I shared the Nut waffle(+$1) and the Shortcake crepe + $1 for French Vanilla coffee. It comes with 2 scoops of ice cream as you can tell from the photos in the gallery. Out of the two, I like the Nut best. Every crevice of the waffle had nuts sitting in it *crunch crunch*  It's a wonderful clean place I dropped by for dessert especially after dinner. They also have a variety of cakes if crepe or waffle is not your thing.  The decor is clean and bright! Clean washrooms too!"}
{"text":"I love coming to pastel ! My favorite items are the black sesame crepe and the green tea crepe. Their waffles are good too, but I personally like crepes more. The ice cream and whipped cream is not too sweet which I like. I recently tried their matcha batter crepe, it wasn't bad, but I prefer sticking to plain crepes with green tea or black sesame ice cream.  I think pastel is a great dessert spot after having dinner around the area. The outdoor seating also makes it a perfect date spot in the summer."}
{"text":"Pretty impressed with their crepes and cute interior. Cakes are generic ones and nothing too unique. Same with the drinks, nothing memorable. Presentation for all desserts are great. The draw of the place is to sit down and chat after dinner in the area.  Note there is a minimum order and sometimes too popular so there may be a wait."}
{"text":"Neat little place filled with a delicious aroma.  The only complain I have, is that parking was confusing. Google map took me to the back of the building round-about but the only available parking is at the front of the building, on yonge street. I don't particularily fancy parallel parking on a major arterial road."}
{"text":"If I was really, really into crepes I think I'd give this place 4 stars. I did grow up in Quebec where après-ski wasn't complete without crepes cooked up in a 100 year old cast iron pan over a wood-fired stove. On the flip side, I can eat my crepe in peace in Pastel. I don't have to endure some 18-year-old joual spouting J.D. playing Ram Jam's Black Betty (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R044sleOW6I_) on the jukebox for half an hour straight. Who does that? Freakin' separatists. *spit*  Anyway, Pastel makes for a nice neighborhood dessert place to take a sweet lady. I had the brownie crepe but despite the name it did not have any actual brownies in it. It was just chocolaty like  a brownie.  The decor in the place really rocks. It's clean, nice colors, nice modern lines. The people who designed didn't ignore the washroom either.  ** DON'T FORGET TO ASK FOR A STAMP CARD **"}
{"text":"My friend and I came around 4 pm on Saturday and the places was almost full. My friend had waffles with bananas and Nutella and I've ordered crepe with chicken. Both dishes were good and tasty. For my request to do the crepe without spinach, everything was done well. The size of dishes were reasonable for its prices.We ordered classic lattes , which were good, but strong. When I asked the waitress to bring me some sugar, she went and never came back, so I had to ask for it another stuff member. They forgot to bring my friend's latte, so we must have asked for it a couple of times. Overall, I liked the atmosphere, location( which is 10 minutes from Finch station) and food, but because of many people and just three stuff members who forgot some stuff can't give 5 stars review. I would come back to this place to try some other interesting items on their menu( different lattes and waffles."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious waffle and crepe! I usually come here on the weekend for a little indulgence. They have ever disappointed me with their desserts (10/10). There are always new items on the menu. My all time favourites are pumpkin and green tea.  I love the place. It looks clean and cozy. But there are not that many tables and if you come here on the weekend during busy time, you'll have to wait. Also,There tables are very very closed to each other. It makes me feel uncomfortable sometimes when I need to sit up or down.  Another down side is that the servers here are always friendly but unfortunately they are not fluent in English. I had to repeat myself few times until my server understand what I want."}
{"text":"A small space, packed on Sunday night.  Got the Sesame Crepe - 2 scoops black sesame icecream (made in-house), whipped cream, cereal, sponge cake. Ice cream is great - love the strong sesame flavor and dense/hard texture, unlike some watered down versions. Crepe is good too. However I just strongly dislike the vanilla sponge cake!!  Was not aware it would be vanilla flavored.... too strong and artificial tasting.   The Strawberry Banana sundae was cute - but just one small scoop of strawberry icecream while the rest is just whipped cream."}
{"text":"Felt like having dessert for dinner on our last night in toronto. This place was right down the street from our hotel so it was very convenient. I ordered a dessert waffle while my boyfriend got a dessert crepe. Both were delicious. We also both got a shake to go with our meal and they were really good too. I loved the little seating area right outside the restaurant. It was really nice to be able to enjoy the beautiful evening weather in canada."}
{"text":"Nice quiet environment. Excellent food and drinks, friendly and quick service. They have lunch special on weekdays which is a very decent deal. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Been to Pastel a couple times, they offer delicious desserts at a reasonable price (similar to other dessert shops in north york). Courteous staffs and clean interior but it's kind of tiny and gets busy most of the time so it's not the best place to chat over your coffee/dessert. But overall, great spot! I had the \"NUTS CREPE\" with almond mocha ice cream."}
{"text":"Pastel is probably one of the better dessert places I've been to. They sell french style desserts, crepes and cheesecakes! It's small, not too many tables, but the service was good. I had a Brownie Crepe which was really tasty. I also had the frozen chocolate drink which was interesting, in a good way. My only complaint though, were the water glasses, they tasted like dishwasher chemicals. Yuck! Otherwise, it was all good! :)"}
{"text":"VENUE/AMBIANCE Small, brightly lit dessert cafe located near Yonge and Finch. This cafe seats probably 20 people at a time and there was a line when we visited on a Sunday night around 9 pm. Street parking only. Tables are close to each other so be prepared to rub elbows.  SERVICE Polite, efficient staff. I didn't feel comfortable staying too long though... I felt a little rushed by the service, but it's understandable seeing as the cafe was busy all night.   FOOD They have a selection of cake slices as well as waffles and crepes on offer. We ordered the black sesame crepe as well as a slice of opera cake and a caffe mocha. The whipped cream on the crepe was delicious, and the ice cream tasted strongly of black sesame. The crepe itself was chewy and thin, just the way it should be. The texture of the ice cream was a little thicker than I'd like but the taste makes up for it. Opera cake was a bit disappointing - it was kinda dry.   QUALITY/VALUE Prices are a little higher than average, but justified by their location.   OVERALL The crepe was pretty good, but the cake was average. I would visit again if I'm in the area... but most likely won't make the trip to Yonge and Finch just for dessert."}
{"text":"So you want some good dessert in North York?  Then this is the place to be!  Located in North York in the Yonge/Finch area, this place is a great joint to have coffee and dessert.    My friend and I came here last week.  I ordered myself the brownie waffle and she had the green tea crepe.  Both are highly recommended."}
{"text":"Nice place for dessert in North York. Have been here many times, friendly service and big portions. The waffles and crepe are really good. Have tried the green tea waffle and the strawberry crepe."}
{"text":"Pastel has great waffles and crepe desserts, Cheesecake Factory dessert and more.  I ordered the black sesame crepe desert, which comes with home made sesame ice-cream and sponge cake.  SO delicious!    The service is always fast, friendly and pleasant! I also love the atmosphere and the fact they offer free wifi is an added bonus."}
{"text":"I came here a few nights ago with another couple just to have some good food and catch up :) I liked how this place has both savory and sweet crepes for people who want to eat \"dinner\" or \"dessert\". The space is quite small, it doesn't fit that many people (about 20?) Anyway, I did see that people had some good reviews so we decided to try some of their more popular choices. We ordered the black sesame crepe, and I ordered their strawberry cheesecake waffle.   The black sesame crepe was pretty good - for black sesame lovers, their ice-cream is packed with sesame flavour, super delicious! I loved my strawberry cheesecake waffle. the waffle was soft but crispy on the outside, perfectly cooked (some places always overcook them), the little cheesecake pieces with the fruits and ice-cream went very well together. There was also whipped cream on the side for serving, but with such a heavy dish, I did not need to use them at all! The portions are pretty huge - so if you're going there with an empty stomach you can eat the crepe/waffle by yourself no problem! but the waffle is definitely more filling, so if you are just going to have a small dessert, go with a friend and share :)"}
{"text":"I been to Pastel before and mostly I come here for the cakes (which is from Rahier)  I came here to mini celebrate my friend's birthday and she ordered a cheese cake. 15 minute passed and I got my raspberry tart and I waited for another 10 minutes and asked our server where's my friend's cheese cake. He told me they ran out AKA someone bought it already.   I was like WTF, why didn't you tell us? Anyways got the menu again and order a crepe since by then all the cakes were gone. The crepe took a bit long too and to be honest it wasn't worth the wait. It was good, but it wasn't like the BEST crepe I had in the world. It wasn't anything special. I wish I spoke Korean because the server's English wasnt too good and gave me nods as I ordered.   I would much prefer to visit Rahier,but too bad they close early and it's not as close as Pastel from home. I guess I have to settle for second best~"}
{"text":"We came here and sat down for a little bit and had their cappuccino and coffee. The drinks here aren't bad and they have Asian fusion style drinks such as sweet potato cappuccino which was very interesting.   Since I didn't order any food, I am grading this solely based on atmosphere and drinks. The sweet potato cappuccino which was offered only for a limited time was not overly sweet and had a fluffy texture though they could have made this better by filtering the sweet potato bits with a cheese cloth.   The atmosphere was quiet and calm. If you order less than $10, they will charge you extra for just sitting there. Overall, this is a unique little cafe and they have adorable drinks. I would recommend this."}
{"text":"Today is like the Nth time I come to this dessert restaurant, and it never disappoints. Not many people know about this place so usually you can always get a seat when you come in. They offer free wifi and parking at the back which is definitely a great plus. Their best dishes for me are the crepes, waffles, and green tea shaved ice cream. The prices are around $10, and if you come in Tues-Fri at noon you can get a crepe+hot drink combo for $10.99. Pastel opens 12-23, and I think they close on Mondays"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to stumble across this place during one of my late night cravings for crepes! We ordered the Nutella crepe but opted for strawberries and vanilla ice cream instead of the bananas and chocolate ice cream.   The Crepe was Fluffy and delicious! My only criticism is that there was way too much whipped cream and not enough strawberries... Not sure if there's a shortage of strawberries but I'm hoping that next time they're a little heavy-handed.  It's got a sweet price point (no pun intended) and very friendly staff! Apparently there is free parking underground but I found some street parking so maybe next time I'll have to do a little bit more exploring.  All in all I would definitely recommend this place if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I really like the crepe here - it is not too crispy like some places I've been to, not too sweet and great with ice cream. The ice cream is not really anything special to be honest - it is the crepe that makes it great! The cakes are from Rahier - it will save you a trip but you can probably buy it elsewhere if you are craving cake. The only bad thing is that there is not a lot of tables - everyone wants to stay long as it is a good place for dates or just to catch up with friends. The price is reasonable but I wouldn't say it is cheap."}
{"text":"I was here last night with my girlfriend to celebrate my birthday, saw the great reviews on Yelp so I thought I check it out myself. Perhaps we went during a busy time, but we were still able to find a seat outside. We for iced lemonade, she got the green tea and I had the raspberry (this was too sweet), salmon crepe and the green matcha crepe. We dug into our savoury crepe, so no pic, but we did snap up our matcha crepe. Delicious from start to finish"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I want to thank them for accepting a party of two 15 minutes before they closed and providing us with excellent customer service.   First off, the menu will leave you wanting for more as they also have savoury crepes for lunch and dinner. The dessert opinions are a great variety between the Asian style and the normal crepes you crave day to day - but with a special touch to it.  I got the sesame crepe which was paired very well with little chunks of sponge cake peanut butter drizzles of chocolate and crunch oats. Usually people would pile of fruits on fruits with crepes, but for this place pairs the ice cream with the right stuff.  Definitely coming back for a late night snack again :)"}
{"text":"I came here with my brother and his gf. I ordered a green tea shaved ice while they had 2 different crepes.   My visit was ruined because the 2 waitresses working literally forgot to bring my order.   2 small groups came after we did and ordered after us. My brother, his gf, and the 2 other small groups who ordered after us all received their order. I saw 2 green tea shaved ice dishes ready to be served - one was given to a table (who came in after us!) and the other one was no where to be found. My brother and his gf were more than half way through their crepes when I started getting annoyed (this was like 10-15 minutes since they received their crepes). I had to ASK where the hell my green tea shaved ice was. The waitress then hurried back behind the counter and talked to the other waitress and quickly brought my dish. Wtf? Too bad, I liked the dessert but no thanks.  Also, there is a minimum $5 order per person for dining in here. If you're gonna set up such a rule, then remember to bring out the items ordered."}
{"text":"Pastel is worth the visit. Lots of options to choose from and my favourite part is their sweets aren't too sweet! It's a bit cramped most of the time though so although there's a welcoming atmosphere.. it isn't great for one on one conversations"}
{"text":"Great spot to meet up with fellow sweet-tooth friends.  Initially we wanted to head to another desert spot which was closed after 10pm. Luckily this spot was opened and was able to indulge enough to feed my sweet tooth.   Dessert: Their portions are large and items are not too sweet and full of flavour. A little disappointed by the lava brownie as it didn't ooze out melted chocolate as it's supposed to.  Everything else was delicious including their matcha ice cream and banana/nutella crepe.  Environment: Casual, modern and very clean!   Staff: Very friendly and always making sure you're enjoying your meal.  Would definitely stop by here again!"}
{"text":"Came in tonight with my hubby for a quick dessert. Staff were friendly and helpful, seating us as efficiently as they could given that the place was nearly full. We ordered the chocolate crepe and were delighted to find it was tasty and not over sweet. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"A group of 7 of us visited Pastel for my soon-to-be a mommy shower a few weeks ago.  As this visit was due to other Yelpers' recommendations, I was looking to validate the claims of nice local creperie.    We ordered a huge variety of savoury crepes; I had chicken and it was good with just enough creme sauce and a small tossed salad on the side, sweet crepes and the green tea snow ice.    Everyone enjoyed what they got (I can't recall all the items as most of us had the savoury crepe for lunch and followed it with shared sweet crepes as dessert).  What really shined were the Rahier pastries but alas, I can't give Pastel credit for Rahier's excellence.    All in all, it's a nice spot to hang out with some girlfriends or on a lazy weekend afternoon with the hubby.  I'm not sure if I would travel out of my way to sample their goodies but certainly will be a go to place if I were ever in the area again."}
{"text":"I've been to pastel a couple of time, and each time they manage to disappoint me somehow. The most recent time, they sat my 2 friends and I at a 2-person table even though we would clearly fit better at a bigger table. Secondly, we arrived at around 10:20pm and ordered by 10:30-10:35. At 11:20, I double-checked our order since it has been almost 45-50 minutes since we ordered our 2 crepes and it still hadn't been served yet. The server then asked us what we ordered, went back to the computer and came back with menus and asked us to re-order (they forgot to put it in the system=didn't make the crepes for us). We then got our green tea matcha crepe and sweet potato crepe, the food was decent, not that great not horrible. And we payed (split the bill 3 ways, $22 something total so $8something each). My two friends paid cash while I paid with debit. My one friend who used a $50 to pay for her bill that was $8 something only got $20 something back because the servers thought that she was paying for the whole bill, despite giving me the debit machine and giving my other friend change for her $20 bill. The servers there are super absent-minded. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Must try their green tea shaved ice, I don't think you can find it anywhere in Canada! The nuts flavor waffle was delicious too. I didn't give them 5 stars because the portion is really tiny."}
{"text":"Don't know what the big hype is about this place. 54 reviews with an average of 4 stars. I had to try it based on all the great reviews. I got the black sesame ice cream crepe with a hot chocolate for $11.99 special lunch combo and also tried the white chocolate mocha. Presentation and service was great but being a Tuesday afternoon it was pretty dead inside so great service is to be expected. Nothing really stood out about this place except maybe the waitress. I thought she was pretty attractive.....lol  The desserts on the other hand were pretty basic if you ask me. Maybe I didn't like it that much because I was just too full and had just finished a pork bone soup at Lim Ga Ne but I don't think this is the case. I love sweets and anything sweet usually fairs well in my books. I found the drinks a bit plain and the sweet level could have been kicked up a notch. The sesame ice cream was great but as for the actual crepe portion I really didn't like it much. The way I see it, if you are gonna make something that is unhealthy anyway and you know your customers are not here to eat healthy then just go all out. If it means extra sugar then by all means put extra sugar. If it means more chocolate then put more chocolate. I'm probably not ever gonna come back for a crepe but there were other things on display that I would love to try like the cheese cakes."}
{"text":"Food -  we ordered and shared the sesame ice cream crepe. The verdict: the crepe was dry and almost crispy-like (not even close to how a crepe should taste like). Oddly, they filled the crepe with cut up sponge cake ?!?!!!  Service - When we arrived, no one came to greet us instead 4 servers were just hanging out behind the counter and yelled out sit wherever and when we choose our spot they said \"not there\" (because we needed to be at least 3 persons) and then my friend pointed out a group of 2 who were sitting at a 3-4 person table and her excuse was to blubber no and forced us to sit in between two busy (and might I add super tight) tables.   I've lived in this area for at least 10yrs and it's my first time at Pastel. Man, what an awful experience.   I am going to warn my friends NOT to go here cuz honestly, their customer service was unprofessional and their food was not measurable to a delicious crepe dessert."}
{"text":"First time here! I have been meaning to try this place but every time I walked by it was packed. There isn't a lot of seating in the cafe, it's especially busy on Friday evenings.   I got the Green Tea crepe which was filled with red bean, sponge cake and green tea ice cream. I also tried the Caffe Latte which arrived with really pretty latte art! Both were delicious and enjoyable. The crepe was especially fresh and tasty.   The service was casual but friendly. Clean washrooms. Prices were OK. I definitely would go back to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. Parking is free which we didnt know before hand. We ordered the smoked salmon and the mushroom crepes. Amazing!!! Very light and tasteful. I had the latte, it was pretty good. We had the sweet potatoe crepes for dessert and the creme brulee, which was dissapointing. I would return for the crepes!"}
{"text":"Place is cute and small. It seats about 20 people. The staff are super friendly. And the place is clean. I was just here with my friend and we were seated right away because it wasn't busy. We ordered the lunch special, I got the mushroom crepe with a white choc. mocha and my friend got the ham crepe with a white hot choc. The special was only $10! We weren't expecting our drinks to have a design on them so that was a cute surprise. The service was quick and the food was tasty! They also have a wide variety of desserts. The place also has free wifi. I'd definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this dessert house made its way in this neighbourhood. We need more choices for desserts in this area.   I got the brownie crepe by the lady behind the counter. It's a crepe filled with whip cream, bananas and brownie bits, sprinkled with icing sugar and drizzled with chocolate sauce on the outside, and served with two scoops of cookie and cream ice cream.   5 stars for the ice cream. Where did they get this thing? It's SOOO GOOD. It tastes absolutely delicious and gourmet. Rich, creamy, and does not melt quickly, it was perfect.   3 stars for the crepe itself. It was slightly undercooked, not the type that is golden brown, nor even  barely golden. The crepe is very soft and tastes just like batter. The brownie was mediocre, nothing special, not fudgey but cakey. The whip cream was soft, and a bit gross. I prefer the ones that hold its shape (kind of like the ones on Chinese cakes0. Chocolate sauce and icing sugar made everything swallow down nicely though.   I'd still go back and try the savoury crepes. My neighbours were eating savoury crepes and it looked sooo good!!   They also have an assortment of mini individual cakes if you prefer cake over crepes. They looked really pretty."}
{"text":"Pastel is my favorite place for waffles and crêpes. I've gone numerous times already and my favorite is the sweet potato waffle! It comes with their homemade sweet potato ice cream. They have lunch specials with select sweet/savoury crêpes and drinks that end at 5pm for $10.99. You can upgrade to a waffle, change the ice cream or latte flavour for extra charge.   This place is really cute and great for catching up with friends or getting some work done (free WiFi). It's a rather small space so best for groups of 4 or smaller. They also have other desserts like parfaits or cakes. The only thing is they now have a policy where each person must make a minimum purchase of $6 before tax. If you don't mind sharing, my advice is to get the lunch special and an extra drink and then split the bill. The portions are rather large anyways. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"They have unique crepes that are so fluffy and gooood! I tried their chocolate crepe and their crepe tasted like a fluffy brownie :) I haven't had similar crepes anywhere else. Best part is that one is good enough for sharing."}
{"text":"Cute find with delicious crepes, love how the texture is chewy instead of dry and crispy. Would definitely come here again, the ice cream is original and flavourful!"}
{"text":"Great place for a first date & catching up with friends. I ordered the banana Nutella waffle and it was average. Nothing special about the taste but the presentation didn't fail to impress. I would definitely try a crepe next time.  My friend and I sat outside on their \"patio\" and we got little to no service. Had to get up to ask for the menu and for the bill. It wasn't busy either, so I guess the waitresses  just weren't very attentive at the time."}
{"text":"Love the lava cake! Smooth, strong chocolate flavour not overly sweet, it was perfect with a cup of warm coconut latte. Yummy in my tummy. Also, There's no private parkings lots, we parked on the street that night. so it requires parallel parking. Embarrassed to say but I have to get off and ask my friend to park the car for me"}
{"text":"Excellent presentation of crepes, waffles, and cakes. Not a lot of choices but there are some unique ice-cream. $10 per crepe, I expect a larger portion or a classy dining atmospheres. I had similar or better crepes in food court for half the price. Overall it's a great place to try, however next time, I will go to food court, order the same crepes with drinks at half the price."}
{"text":"Found out about this dessert place through yelp and decided to try it. Pastel Creperie is a pretty cute, cozy, bright little crepe/pastry/tea/latte/coffee place ideal for hanging out with some friends and maybe groups of 6.   I decided to try the black sesame crepe with my friend. The portions are huge, and the prsentation of the crepe was pretty nice with zig zagged chocolate drizzle on top. One order of crepe comes with 2 large scoops of black sesame ice cream sprinkled with what tasted like honey coated granola which I thought tasted pretty good. The ice cream was creamy and rich with sesame flavour and complemented well with small bits of crunchy granola. The crepe itself was pretty good as well. It was thin and chewy. The inside of the crepe is loaded with whipped cream mixed with a small amount of cubed cake bits and sprinkled with mactcha powder on the ends of the crepe. Although the whipped cream filling was a little too much, I enjoyed my crepe overall.  For my drink, i decided to try the Toasted Marshmallow latte. Initially I was only going to order a tea. But the cute design on the latte really caught my eye so I decided to try it. The latte art is basically a cartoon fireball with a happy face on it. The latte was creamy and enjoyable as well.  Pastel Creperie also offers other desserts such as rasperry tarts, creme brulee, and fruit tarts which all look very tasty. I would definitely come back to try their special which is the sweet potatoe crepe and sweet potatoe latte as well!   ."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and enjoyed it. Never tried the savoury items, but the sweet plates were really tasty and filling."}
{"text":"Great taste, good selection, friendly service. Clean place. Small tables and busy traffic. We were moved over a bit to make space for others. Servers had trouble with English do they got it order wrong, but managed to correct it after we pointed that out on the menu."}
{"text":"I'm giving this a 2.5 star as it averaged out my two experiences. 4 stars for their crepes. I especially love savoury crepes and their chicken crepe with mushrooms & cheese hit the spot. However, the cakes I had yesterday (coffee flavoured and crème brûlée) was awful. Okay, the coffee one was decent when comparing it to crème brûlée. It was a mousse with a cake centre and the coffee flavour was there. The crème brûlée however was like a 1/5. That one point was for it looking pretty. Let me tell you what was wrong: crème brûlée is called brûlée because your supposed to torch the top sugar layer which doesn't appear to be done. There was no burnt sugar layer or even a hard layer indicating that sugar was even melted. And the crème part tasted exactly like those egg tarts from Asian bakeries. It was so eggy I had a hard time swallowing it. Crème brûlée is my favourite dessert and this one missed it by a long shot."}
{"text":"Their service can be a little slow but their ice cream and waffles are great! I wouldn't recommend the coffee tough. Excellent for desserts when you also don't feel like the monster portions at demetres.   Fair warning: they drizzle chocolate over all their crepes and waffles, so if you're not a chocolate fan make sure you ask them to skip that!"}
{"text":"I like this place but I didn't find it amazing. I got a salty crepe and a chocolate cake. The crepe was decent, there's nothing to rave or criticize about. I really enjoyed the cake. I went very out of my way for this restaurant and although it's a cute little place to go with a girlfriend for brunch, I don't think I'll go back just because it was so far.  I would give it a try though if you live around the area!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on Saturday night searching for a bit of warmth from outside. the place was busy and a nice flow of customers quickly came and left. They have both sweet and savoury crepes and waffles on the menu and selection of coffee and teas.   We ordered a cup of military latte, green tea and crepe with sesame icecream. The dishes came out in a few minutes. The military latte was quite nice. The military latte was strong, refreshing and lightly sweetened. Tasted good plus the addition of the health advantages of matcha - thumbs up! I would order the latte again if I lived nearby. The crepes came with whipped cream on the side with peanut granola and cubes of sponge cake inside the crepe and two large scoops of black sesame ice cream. It was a nice combo. The toppings worked well together. The dish can easily be shared with others.  Next dessert crepes I would try: matcha green tea, premium matcha, nuts and chocolate.   The restaurant is a nice hang out after a meal for a bit of chit chat with family and friends. I found the staff to be accommodating and friendly.   It's a relaxing and open space with comfy seating albeit a bit small. If you are in the neighbourhood just swing through for a visit!"}
{"text":"Came here after reading some great reviews, however I was disappointed. The staff couldn't really speak English, which would have been fine except that I only speak English. She just seemed confused that I was in there... Ordered a dessert crepe  and hot chocolate. Hot chocolate was not sweet (which some ppl enjoy, but not me) and the crepe was just so-so. Not bad, but nothing to write home about. Will probably try out some of the other dessert places in the area instead if coming back."}
{"text":"I like desserts, and this is my favourite crepe place at ALL times. Highly recommend the strawberry short cake one if you haven't been here before, it's always been my go-to cause it's not overly sweet unlike the crepes I've had at other places."}
{"text":"I haven't gone to Pastel in a while but, my visits there were always pretty amazing. This is one of my dad's favourite place for a coffee and a dessert. The place itself is very small, with a few tables but, extremely clean and tidy. The service too, has been always very pleasant. Parking can be nice when the timing is right however, it is definitely a gamble. Weekends from what I remember, is pretty busy. Otherwise, I highly recommend this hidden gem if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago during lunch with coworkers. We sat outside, which is a small area with maybe 2 or 3 tables set up, but it was cute. We all ordered our own crepes, I got the mushroom crepe, as it's the only savoury vegetarian crepe option. My friends got the smoked salmon and the roasted turkey crepes.   It took about 15 minutes for our food to arrive, even though it wasn't too busy (maybe 2 more tables were occupied inside). My crepe was delicious and I was able to finish the entire thing by myself, which isn't something I can normally do.  My favourite part of the restaurant though, was their hospitality. The waitress was very sweet and came around a couple times to check on us. And when we finished our crepes, we realized that there was a lunch special that was a crepe and a drink, which we didn't order. When we brought it up to the waitress, she said she could make our drinks to go and charge us the special, which we opted for. We all got the raspberry lemonade and it was honestly delicious. I would go back just for that, though I'm pretty sure it was just made with the lemonade powder that you can get from any grocery store."}
{"text":"Kudos to whoever runs Pastel.  I have been visiting them periodically for something like eight years and they have consistently maintained their high quality menu, service and ambiance. Pastel is not one of those all too common businesses that goes downhill a couple of years after opening. My criticism of Pastel has always been that they have limited space and with people getting on Wifi and camping in there seating is always unavailable.  With that aside, the crepes, which are their main bread and butter, are good, different and rich. They are not Japanese crepes like people imagine and write in their reviews - go to Japan and you will see hint: mochi - but they are interesting and creative. They are also large. Their sweets have always been coming from Rahier and nothing has changed. I had a crème Brule and liked both the taste and the lightness. Like everything else they do well with the presentation. The watermelon slush, which is only available in the summer, was tasty. The watermelon used, was a watermelon i.e. not some chemical agent meant to mimic watermelon and was a sweet one. The three girls serving that day were all kind, smiling, sincere and quite nice. Not many businesses can claim that. One of the girls actually accidentally poured water on my friend's shoes, yet promptly came back with paper towels to dry the shoes. The other one brought over a menu from inside and also a table stand with the Wi-Fi password as soon as asked, which connected without issues. Speaking of which, they have a functional patio. The waitresses are all smiling so it must not be bad working there either. The 'pastel' colour schemes shows better in the dark of night, but again is something that sets them apart."}
{"text":"One of my favorite things to eat in NYC was Japanese crepe from eight turn crepes. After moving to dc, I found nothing comparable to it. So while visiting my in laws for the holidays in Toronto, I was dying to see if there were any crepe places nearby. Pastel appeared on my top of yelp search and instantly I knew we had to give it a try!   All 6 of us went with their lunch specials - $11.99 for a crepe and drink. For $1.50 extra, you can order the waffle as your special.   I went with their specialty new crepe - sweet potato purée filled with shaved almond and maple syrup topped with two ginormous scoops of sweet potato ice cream and Creme brûlée coffee. The whole dish was pure heaven in my mouth. I especially loved the chewy texture of the crepe skin. It didn't get soggy at all which is different than the French styled crepe. Everything was perfectly balanced - nothing overwhelmingly sweetened or heavy.   My table also sampled brownie crepe, chicken, ham, and tropical fruit waffle. My husband's aunt was chanting 5 stars from the first to very last bite. My mother in law who didn't much of an appetite polished her plate. My father and brother in law who usually stick to their familiar eats were impressed and chomped away. My husband claimed his waffle with pistachio almond ice cream was one of the best waffles he'd had.   Although the place was small and busy, the service was attentive and we didn't feel rushed to leave. We were given plenty of time to chat and sip our drinks after the blissful meal. Overall - everything tasted beyond amazing, everyone was more than satisfied! We couldn't help but left with a beaming smile across our face. A well deserved all around 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite cafe to visit. I sit here for a few hours with friends sometimes, and the servers are attentive. The servers also make the desserts themselves. I sat near the glass where I was able to watch them make the crepes. Having Honoka serve me is really great. She's always smiling, and her plating skills are very impressive. The cafe is pretty small, but I like the atmosphere of it.  They have a lunch menu Monday to Friday 12pm-5pm for $10.99, which is a sweet deal. You get one crepe and one beverage from the select menu. However, you can sub other crepes or change to a waffle for a small premium. The same goes for subbing drinks."}
{"text":"My green tea crepe had a red bean stuffing! It was amazing! Here's to hoping they would have a green tea millie crepe in the future!"}
{"text":"Great addition to North York, which is lacking in any options for breakfast. I had the Ham crepe, with an Americano, and both the crepe and coffee were delicious. The service was super friendly, and based on this first experience, I'm excited to try the desert crepes at some point in time as well.  Also, it's listed as $$$, but really it's more of a $, or low $$ in terms of cost.  Hope this place does well, we need more places like this in North York!"}
{"text":"I donno. Felt like their could be more?  It was good, but not great? I'm not sure, just can't put my finger on it.  But I would return .."}
{"text":"Pastel is a small dessert restaurant and I've been here multiple times with friends and/or family who've all enjoyed it.  The menu's pretty large for a dessert place and there's a choice of crepe or waffles for each menu item - most people I'm with prefer the crepes.  Drinks don't seem to be terribly popular with pretty much anyone I've been with but I haven't ever gotten anything aside water for myself so I can't attest to this.  The atmosphere's nice, though a little crowded when they try and move people / tables around due to space restrictions.  Definitely don't go early evening as they get really busy.  You do have the option to sit outside too.  Staff are very friendly and food comes out at a quick pace so that's a plus too.  Parking's mostly on the road and paid, but there's apparently a place around the corner you can park that's free if you tell them you're going to Pastel - it's written on the bottom of their menu.  Prices run a little high on some of their drinks and smaller stuff but most other items are fine.  Good recommendation if you're near Yonge & Finch and want a dessert.  Just remember they're pretty small and get busy between 7-9pm, especially on weekends."}
{"text":"Cute dessert place in uptown that serves crepe style sweets and savouries. You have a couple of options, and different toppings/styles to choose from. We got the fruit parfait and matcha crepe. Decent size, and sweetness not-too-overloard. If you love yourself some sugar, it's the place to go. It's not so sweet that you'll feel sick half way through, but at the end of the day, it's a dessert place so don't expect mild tasting crepes. Cute presentation of the desserts and didn't take too long for them to come.  Might want to call before coming because it seemed like it's really busy all the time.  Parking in a pain in the area."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend to try their desserts. The ice cream was fantastic, but the crepes were mediocre at best. It is a bit overpriced for crepes and waffles.  Overall, this place is worth a try if you are looking for a new dessert place, but i probably would not go back here. Atmosphere of the place was friendly enough."}
{"text":"Found this creperie & dessert house by accident.  I was walking up to Yonge and Finch and saw this lovely shop.   I finally had a chance to visit the restaurant. We have a party of 5, we ordered 2 chicken crepe, frankfurter crepe, green tea and red bean crepe. The crepe is wonderful, the presentation is very nice.  I also ordered French Vanilla coffee, it is very smooth and I wish I had 2nd cup again.  We also ordered the cakes, they are from Rahier Patisserie. Wonderful chocolate mousse cake.  I have searched for a long time for a brunch place in North York area. This is definitely the place to go back next time."}
{"text":"Cute place and cute food   The waffles and crepes here  are so good!!! Never disappointed and the drinks are nice as well. Service  is Great!"}
{"text":"Yum! I've been to this place too many times to not write a review.   tldr; A fantastic dessert spot for those with a sweet tooth for crepes and ice cream. And let's be real, what is wrong with you if you don't?! Definitely THE place to hit up if you're with a small group of friends and looking for a place to eat and chat.  The creperie is squeezed between a slew of retail shops under the condos of Yonge Street in North York. It's a very clean and well organized shop that sells both hot and cold drinks (the non bubble tea variety) along with their selection of sweet/savory crepes/waffles and cakes. They also have some other picks such as ice cream sundaes, shaved ice and petit fours. Their serving presentation is gorgeous and that expectation extends to your taste buds as well!  My pick this time:  Black sesame crepes (5/5): Nothing can beat their home-churned black sesame ice cream which is served with crunchy peanut toppings on a freshly made crepe wrapped around whipped cream and sponge cake. At first the two scoops of ice cream might look intimidating but you'll soon wonder where it all went because each bite is heaven! The black sesame ice cream is the best of it's flavour I've ever had. The only thing I'll nitpick about this is that the crepes are cooled when they're served to you, but that might be because they don't want the ice cream melting everywhere.  Stuff I've had before:  Green tea with red bean crepes (5/5): Pretty much all their crepes are a hit but this is the other one where their ice cream is homemade. The minute you bite into it there is an explosion of strong matcha flavour which I love. The two scoops sit on a crepe wrapped around azuki (red bean) paste, sponge cake and whipped cream. If you love the red bean/green tea combination then this is the one to get.   Green tea shaved ice (4.5/5): If you've never had shaved ice before then give it a shot! It's like a slightly watered down version of their ice cream but the texture is sublime. Each bite is like biting into a sliver of smooth creamed ice and is a melt-in-your mouth experience (quite literally). The matcha flavour is also very strong in this and the red bean paste pairing is delicious. It also comes with whipped cream to add some richness to this sweet sweet dessert.   Sweet potato latte (3/5): This is probably the only miss I've had at this place. Maybe I'm just not a big fan of the sweet potato latte but it tasted like sweet milk to me with a slight sweet potato flavouring. The texture was also a bit grainy so I don't think the sweet potato was pureed finely enough. A disappointment sadly.   I love the staff at this place! They're very attentive and will refill your water even if you've finished eating. They're also very helpful in answering any questions you have about the menu. One last thing I'll say about their menu is that their desserts aren't too too sweet. Instead they're just right."}
{"text":"It's a very cute café with about 5-7 tables. I came around 7PM on a Friday night and the place was half packed. It's quite a nice place to share desserts and have a nice latte over a chat with friends, and we were lucky enough to sit for a good 1.5 hour despite finishing our order. It was nice of the waitress to keep refilling our waters even though we were done eating. However, when it gets to about 8PM or so, the place gets a lot more traffic and you probably won't be able to stay as long as we did.  One of the main reasons my friends and I came here was because of the sweet potato items on the menu! As an avid sweet potato fan, I ordered the regular sweet potato latte ($5) and a sweet potato crepe ($9) to share. The sweet potato latte was everything sweet potato I could imagine. It didn't taste powdery at all! There weren't chunks in it, but it was very authentic.. exactly like a sweet potato in liquid form with  milk. As much as I love sweet potato, it got a little too ... potato-ey after finishing my drink AND having the sweet potato crepe as well.  But I'd still drink it again though :P  I really liked the sweet potato crepe as well! There was sweet potato puree inside the crepe - which is SO delicious. And there was allegedly 2 scoops of sweet potato ice cream on the crepe. This was kind of a dark purplish colour (like taro). It didn't really taste  like sweet potato at all.. but I can't really describe what it tastes like. Think a more bland taro ice cream flavor.   More places need to have sweet potato! How can I go back to just a chocolate crepe now.."}
{"text":"Definitely my go to for crepes and coffees! Great for small friends catchups Very cute atmospheres . Wifi available and parking at the back. Prices are reasonable  I love the matcha latte, as a big fan of matcha  Savoury crepes i love the smoked salmon and frankfurter ones! Both are most trys.  Parfaits are really good here too. Matcha and mix fruits are my jam.  Their lunch specials are a good deal for weekdays"}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite dessert house in Finch/Yonge area! The quality of the crepes definitely speak for themselves, but the clean feel of the place and the variety of dessert selections are what I love most about this place.   My favourite is the dessert crepe with red bean inside and green tea ice-cream on top. But if you go with an empty stomach, the savoury salty crepes should be a good choice too.  Today, I decided to order the salmon crepe as well as a pistachio buttercream cake- beyond yumminess! The taste of pistachio is strong but not too overwhelming and it is not too sweet- even though this dessert is not made in-house."}
{"text":"This place is so cute.... and great little desserts as well, I haven't had anything savoury but go have a coffee and ice cream :)   Its wonderful and great service!!!  Small though so tough for groups... or motorcycle gear :p"}
{"text":"I could not forget their Premium Matcha Crepe at this place! Went there with a girl friend and fell in love with it! The atmosphere of the shop is sweet, and there are a lot of crepe,  icecream, waffle, sandwich options to satisfy whatever your craving is. The matcha crepe came with matcha icecream, redbeans, and chewy mochi as well. Everything goes so well together, and very filling! I was full having this for lunch. Seating is limited though, so if you have a big group try to go during quieter times to ensure seating and quicker service."}
{"text":"The crepes and cakes are good, the service is great. One of my favourite dessert places."}
{"text":"This was a tad more expensive than I had thought, but still affordable. There was a mediocre number of selections to choose from despite three different menus (one menu was just the pictures of another menu, and I didn't really look at the third menu). Servings were a lot though, which is a good point, but I don't quite understand why there is extra whip cream on the side when there is already (a good amount of) whip cream inside the crepe.   Taste-wise, it was quite delicious, except for the excess amount of whip cream inside my crepe. Otherwise, I love it. It was nicely decorated too.  The place has a very nice coffee-shop feel to it. It's small and cozy enough, and the interiors are nicely designed as well. We were allowed to choose our own seats, which is nice since the shop isn't that full so we get to choose wherever we would like to sit. The waitresses were very helpful, especially when we first sat down and they make sure to refill our cups of water constantly.  I believe they also offer sandwiches(?) or just entree/appetizers kind of food. They were still advertising Winter Special with Salmon when we got there last week, which was definitely not during Winter.  Free wifi, and prices falls within the $10-13 range per dish. I didn't look at the drinks section because, let's be honest, we were only looking forward to eating sweet crepes with ice-cream."}
{"text":"I only got the French vanilla latte but it was delicious! My friends each got crepes and the shaved green tea. They all loved it so much, not a speck was left! You're averaging at about $8 a dessert.   Very sweet staff and attentive. Small place so you're going to have to wait if you're heading out on a weekend."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch to try their crepes, but left a little disappointed. We both ordered savoury crepes which was probably a mistake..   Should have went with one sweet and one savoury as I believe they are more known for the sweet stuff.  Venue: The place seemed clean, but had a couple of pestering fruit flies.   Service: prompt and friendly  Food:  I've had salmon crepes before so this is based on a comparison of salmon crepes I've had at other places. There wasn't anything that wowed me about the crepe. The white sauce they put on it tasted off and the fish tasted off as well.. The side salad was bland like leafy garnish rather than a salad.   The chicken salad crepe wasn't any better. Just chicken mixed with dressing and lettuce.  My boyfriend and I both left feeling like we overpaid and could have made these dishes better ourselves.. Sorry, but not a fan of the savoury crepes here.   Wish we could give them more stars, but will update the review if we get a chance to try the sweet crepes."}
{"text":"Had an excellent experience here tonight!  Their crepes and waffles are made JUST right, everything isn't overly sweet. Drinks are made with love, every hot beverage is served with a design on the top, I love it!   A small little place, but just enough for you to enjoy a nice dessert after dinner.  Want something savoury? They've got that too!  Definitely will be back to try more!  P.S. Service was also excellent"}
{"text":"Decor: 4 Food: 4 Service: 4  I've always wanted to try Pastel but I never got a chance.  I did after all!  I love almost everything about this place! The decor is really cute, simple and natural. The waitresses were friendly and always smiling.   We ordered the Chicken and Frankfurter crepes which came with a healthy salad.  We also ordered two lattes.  They messed up the order on one of our lattes and when we told them, they apologized and made another one fairly quickly.    The only drawback is the wait time for getting the crepes.  I think we waited approx 20 mins and I was pretty hungry already.  I'll definitely come back for more! You can park at the condo behind the store if you tell the concierge that you are visiting Pastel instead of paying and parking on the street."}
{"text":"Finally found an amazing crepe place in Toronto!  5 stars for the sweet shortcake crepe! 4 stars for the savoury crepes!  The shortcake crepe was perfect.  It was delicious with lots of fillings of strawberry, blueberry, sponge cake with two large scoops of strawberry ice cream.  We also got 2 savoury crepes - 1 chicken, spinach & cheese mushroom and 1 frankfurter spinach cheese.  The crepes were nicely done with tasty fillings but could have been a little bit more flavourful.  There's also a great selection of cold and hot drinks.  My daughter really enjoyed her frozen white chocolate and my green tea hot latte was very good."}
{"text":"Love the crepe!! There were lots of mushrooms and mozzarella cheese and spinach in the portobello mushroom crepe, and the flavors blend very well. The almond flavored latte I had was also very rich, and the presentation was special. Service was also good, the waitress was very friendly."}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant/café, located on the first floor of the condo building always looks and taste very nice. In terms of the atmosphere and the interior, the quality is certainly a few notches above your average in-store eatery. Try green tea latte there, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Deeelicious and prettiful crepes. A must visit cafe if 1) you want to feed your phone and 2) enjoy some yummy crepes. Sweet and savoury crepes are available in case you're wondering, so whether you're going for brunch or just hanging out with friends seems like a good idea.  Staff are very friendly and the restaurant is neat and tidy. The decor is minimal but gives a clean and welcoming feel. A bonus is that they have a patio - definitely nice during warmer weather.   The crepes are neat and nicely presented - you can tell the staff took the time to prepare them, no matter which one you order. Personal favourite at this cafe: sweet potato crepe with homemade sweet potato ice cream (had that twice 2 weeks in a row). The syrup gives it a nice rounded touch. The dish in general is not overly sweet; just right in my opinion. The portions are not small, but not huge either. However, in my opinion it's probably better to share with some (you can try more things that way too). Also tried their frozen white chocolate - nothing too out of the ordinary, a bit too sweet and heavy for my liking, but you can actually taste the white chocolate as opposed to other places that over use vanilla ice cream. Might be better off trying their lattes next time though; the green tea lattes is really popular.   Will definitely be a returning customer.  PS. On their website they offer free parking at one of the nearby condos - there's a section for retails customers. It's probably more convenient parking on the street though as the parking was quite bothersome to get to. Adding to that, the buzzer never works in the garage so you have to walk up the way you drove down from."}
{"text":"Pastel is a classic dessert joint. I always order a crepe and the green tea (with oreo bits) shaved ice here. I have been meaning to review this place for a while now. Just haven't gotten to it. But so far, every time i've been here, the quality has been great, and consistent. If I am in the area, I would drop by this place for great dessert. Quick service.   Be aware: sometimes there may be a little bit of a line because it is a small place. (They should extend!!) Try not to come with more than 4-6 people =/  Parking - pay for parking in the front, or find on the side streets. I wouldn't risk 'trying to get away with a ticket' because parking enforcement is pretty tough in the area.   If you are reading this, I highly suggest coming to Pastel! Go! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Nice and modern, this place serves some good lunch options like stuffed crèps and wonderful waffles as well as a good selection of some tasty beverages. I actually liked their hot chocolate, and pieces of brownie on a waffle make for a great mouthwatering combination. To score all five stars I'd recommend them to use better quality sausage and more interesting condiments instead of your usual vinegary mustard and ketchup and also putting toppings on both halves of waffles would make it more delicious."}
{"text":"There was seven of us and we were there after having a big dinner. Everyone seemed to enjoy everything they ordered. I had the toasted marshmallow latte and sweet potato crepe. I enjoyed the crepe a lot but the latte could have used more sugar.  One thing to note. Seating is super limited so it's really hard to get a table if there's a group of u. We got lucky when we arrived."}
{"text":"The best place for waffles and parfaits! Seriously so amazing! I've been here on multiple occasions, so I've tried their strawberry shortcake waffle, sweet potato crepe, green tea parfait, mixed fruit parfait... and they're all wonderful. Their desserts are light, and perfectly sweet. The portions are large so they're worth your buck, and the waitresses are so nice and attentive. Since seating is limited and the place is usually busy on weekends, it's better if you come with one or two friends for a quick chat. It's such a cute little cafe!"}
{"text":"Walking down Yonge St. on a Friday night with no reservations is generally not a good idea. Coming from Union Social Eatery (review will be up in a day or so [[shamelessly self-promoting]]) I was craving for some good dessert.  Obviously Sugar Marmalade was filled to the rooftops and could in no way accommodate my party of 7.  So onwards North we go.  We stumbled into Pastel as they had a corner table large enough to seat us (they also have a little patio).  The menu itself is fairly extensive for such a small restaurant ranging from savoury crepes to dessert crepes onwards to shaved ice and a variety of café drinks such as coffee/lattes/teas etc.  I ordered the Brownie crepe and chai latte.   The crepe was honestly amazing.  The crepe was warm and soft while the brownies and oreo ice cream (omg) made the sweetest desserty flavour ever. It was also big enough to share (yay).   But do skip the latte.  It didn't taste as much like chai as it did warm milky water.   I'm generally not a fan of crepes (I feel like waffles are so much more worthwhile) but this has cracked open the door for me.  .5 star off for the latte & .5 star off for the big ass mosquito that was swooping around me the entire time."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to go here when I was in high school, but never had the opportunity. Recently came here with my bf and had a wonderful time.  I ordered a chocolate mascarapone crepe which was delicious. It wasn't too sweet and the fruits complimented it perfectly. A little pricey, but it's an indulgence. I switched out my ice cream for the cappucino almond and creme brulee - cappucino almond won hands down! **Interesting fact: they make their own ice cream**  Bf ordered the brownie crepe which tasted equally as delicious! Will definitely be coming back in the future.  TL;DR A little pricey, but crepes are beautifully presented and tasty. Would recommend for coming with your girl friends or going out as a couple for dessert."}
{"text":"Great crêpe. I really recommend this coffee shop. The quality of the waffle is so fresh too. I really like their food"}
{"text":"Been to this lovely spot on multiple occasions for afternoon tea with friends. I really like the dessert crepes with Asian ingredients and my favs are the Matcha Green Tea and the Black Sesame, which both include home-made ice cream! At $10, the crepes are beautifully presented, have a good amount of filling, and are great to share between 2-3 people for a snack. The interiors are simple and bright with a calm ambience. Even though it's a small space, the staff are cool with lingering and are attentive with refilling water. There's a minimum $5 spending per person but it's easy to fulfil if eating, and fair considering that people stay for hours at times."}
{"text":"Four of us came here for some desserts.   This is a lovely place to spend a nice time with friends. Although the place is quite small, the staff is extremely friendly and the decor is clean and modern.   They offer sweet and savoury crepes, desserts and cakes. Crepes and waffles was amazing. We came out very satisfied. Again, a really nice place to have the relaxing moment with friends."}
{"text":"I had their mushroom crepe and it was superb! It was loaded with mushroom and cheesy goodness. The salad that accompanied the crepe was fresh and well dressed.  Their brownie waffle was very good as well, and not overly sweet even though one would think it would be. It's loaded with whipped cream, chocolate sauce, powdered sugar, ice cream and crispy warm waffles!  I would give this place 2 thumbs up with great service as well!"}
{"text":"Tiny place with high quality crepes! Love this place cause the staff love their job :)"}
{"text":"Cute little cafe with an outdoor patio. Perfect for the summer to enjoy a savoury treat!  The very first thing that I have to mention is their EXCELLENT level of service and degree of attentiveness. *appreciative applaud* The waiters would check up on you every now and then to make sure you're doing okay with everything. My glass of water never goes empty because they always refill it! YES, YES YES!! (I'm really big on customer service at establishments therefore, I always place A LOT of emphasis in this aspect. I mean, it does make a HUGE difference in your visit/dining experience right?!)  Many yelpers have mentioned that they prefer the savoury crepes over the sweet ones and I can see why.  For my first visit, I ordered the Matcha Green Tea Crepe. The crepe was filled with a red bean paste, whip cream and pieces of sponge cake along with two scoops of green tea ice cream on the side. The presentation is absolutely gorgeous! The crepe was yummy, however, after a few bites... I got sick of it. (I find that for sugary treats, it only takes a few bites to satisfy those taste buds. Perhaps, I do not have that big of a sweet tooth after all!). For my second visit, I ordered their lunch special: the Chicken Crepe with a Hazel Nut Latte. The savoury crepe was DELICIOUS! Stuffed with a generous amount of chicken and mushrooms. However, it is a bit too salty for my liking... Nonetheless, every bite was satisfying! MUST TRY THE SMOKED SALMON CREPE! I tried a piece from my friend and it was HEAVEN. I kid you not.  My only disappointment was the Hazel Nut Latte. I'm always sceptical of trying flavoured lattes.. but, I always listen to my taste buds and so why not! Yet again, there was no hazel nut flavour in this latte whatsoever! It just tasted like a regular latte... :( It was still good though."}
{"text":"Overall this place was good but the chocolate lava cake was disappointed. Don't order it.  It wasn't melting inside the cake. So it's not a lava cake"}
{"text":"Their crepes were nice and yummy. 7/10  But what I liked the most was the cake! I got the Opera Cake and it was one of the best chocolate cake I've ever had."}
{"text":"Come and get your Green Tea Frosty Flakes!  It is just so pretty.. with the flavour infused right into the ice...with red bean and whipped cream on the side and topped off with Oreo crumbs! The texture of the Frosty Flakes is quite unique..   Pastel has it in different flavours too including Cappuccino and Chocolate... But Matcha RULES!"}
{"text":"After hearing great things about Pastel Creperies & Dessert House, my friends and I finally had the opportunity to try it! The place was a lot smaller than I imagined with tables to accommodate about 30 people. We arrived at around 9pm on a Friday night and waited for about 30 minutes when we finally got a table. Since I had so much time to look at the menu while waiting, I was sure of what I wanted which was the Black Sesame crepe. The price range was decent, around $11 dollars for a crepe and $13 for a waffle.   When it came out, I was so excited. The presentation of the crepe was amazing and every crepe comes out looking marvelous. The unique part of Pastel Creperies & Dessert House's crepes was the fact that they include sponge cake inside of the crepe. It tasted amazing and the crepe was very well done. Another thing that the dessert house has made unique was the fact that certain ice creams are homemade at the restaurant! These flavours include sesame and green tea. The taste is much stronger. My friend got a green tea crepe and the green tea ice cream has a much stronger matcha flavour. It tasted more \"real\" but on the other hand, was less sweet.   Service was good too. The servers try their best to accommodate although it was fairly packed with many people waiting to get a seat. Overall, I look forward to coming back and trying out their other flavours as well as their drinks!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and both times I've been very pleased and satisfied. I only wish the place was bigger, because it's pretty tiny, seating is limited, and it can feel kind of cramped at times. Their crepes though are great, and the most recent time I went, I also ordered a mint chocolate latte which was a) good and b) came with the coolest latte art I have ever seen in the form of a CAT!!!!! MAJOR PROPS for that omg it was so exciting, I almost couldn't bear to drink it. My friends and I came for the sole purpose of trying their sweet potato crepe, which was really unique and interesting and pretty good. It actually tasted like sweet potato because there was sweet potato puree on the inside. It also came with two scoops of sweet potato ice cream, but none of us really thought it tasted like sweet potato... maybe it was taro, because it was kind of a greyish-purplish colour. Tried a sip of the sweet potato latte as well and it definitely had a very strong and distinct sweet potato flavour. Regardless of what you order here though, I can't imagine it being anything but good, and the cafe is really cute. Definitely order a latte because I've also seen pictures on Instagram where they do like cartoon characters and other shapes, love it!"}
{"text":"Came here a while back craving something sweet and i must say the crepes are quite delicious. The sweetness had a perfect balance that was not too overwhelming. Unfortunately, the drinks looked more appealing than they tasted and were a little bit below my expectations. The service was very friendly and the restaurant had was simple and clean. Other than that, I definitely look forward to coming back here again."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Came here last night for my dad's birthday, and I was absolutely blown away. The crepes were absolutely magnificent, mouthwatering delicious, not to mention beautifully presented. Each crepe was a work of art.  We ordered the Strawberry Shortcake crepe, the Lychee crepe, the Match Green tea crepe, and the roasted salmon crepe.  The three sweet crepes all came with two scoops of ice cream, each suited to the taste of the crepes themselves. I particular, I felt that the Lychee crepe, mixed with the banana ice cream, made for an amazing blend of flavors that was a pleasure to experience. The contents of each crepe was soft and tender, very pleasant and not too overwhelming with sweetness.  The roast salmon crepe was also very good. The soft wrapping pastry combined with the Alfredo sauce topped with tender roast salmon that melts in your mouth was the best part of the night. I highly recommend this dish.  As for the presentation, you can see for yourself.  The service was nice and friendly. The prices were a bit high, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, a very Asian-style cafe with chic modern look. The staff is attentive, polite, and service and food came fast. Prices are reasonable.   I had the salmon crepe, while my friend had creme brule. The crepe was just average, served with a light salad. My friend's creme brule tasted great and it was smooth, but didn't have the hard layer on top which was weird (perhaps they didn't have a flame that day). My friend enjoyed her latte.   Overall, I like this place. I'd recommend it, and would return to try their desserts."}
{"text":"I had a Cheesecake Factory red velvet cheesecake which was scrumptious.  My friend had an almond mochacinno, which he loved.  Great service.  Free parking is available but call them to find out where exactly."}
{"text":"I went for an after dinner desert, and had a green tea crepe and a hot green tea white chocolate drink.  The crepe was delicious, with green tea ice cream on the side. It had just a hint of sweetness to it, which suits my taste.   Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Had the black sesame crepe, tropical crepe? And toasted marshmallow latte.  Prob one of the better crepe dessert places I've been to.  I would've given the food about a 4 star rating tho the originality, gave it the extra star.    The latte was awesome.  Cool latte art.  Be advised there is a minimum charge for guests so, if you're going there to chill with friends you might as well get something $5 I believe.  Would go again."}
{"text":"First time here today and enjoyed it! I was craving crepes for a while and definitely didn't want to resort to the typical Demetres desserts.   Upon coming in, I had to wait for a while as the seating area is very limited and because it was Friday night. I spent the time admiring the modern decor (still with Christmas decorations haha) and looked at the different cakes available (some from Cheesecake factory!) behind their glass display.  As I sat down, my neighbour had a latte with a pretty leaf design on top. I am a sucker for drinks with designs on top and so I ordered the same thing. I also ordered Strawberry Shortcake and Brownies crepes to share. Midway through my meal, my neighbour on my other side ordered some drink with a heart made of chocolate sprinkles/flakes on top! It was so cute and I was so jealous! Just a minor negative on my Hazelnut latte I ordered. Did not taste the hazelnut at all...  Will definitely be back if I am in the area craving for desserts.  TIP: Park at the condo at 500 Doris Avenue and let the attendant know that you are eating at the cafe. You will have access to the condo's free underground visitors parking."}
{"text":"Came here for dessert and they have a good selection of desserts to choose from.  Taste is okay nothing too special and it's a small place so seating is limited if you're there with a big party.  Staff is super nice, I would give them a 4 out of 5 on service alone."}
{"text":"I love the crepes here, but the drinks were okay. There was a time when the workers offered us the deal for the day: two crepes + two drinks for $10. They later told us the promotion was not available on the weekends after we had already started eating."}
{"text":"Nice and cute cafe in the Finch area. Visited the place with friends a few days ago and had desserts - chocolate oreo parfait and araganto.. Both were nice.."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by on the weekend to grab some yummy dessert. It was our first time here so finding a parking spot was difficult.  Although the place is small it has a cozy and warm environment. The food and drinks were great and so was the service. Everyone was very nice and we ended up staying here for a little over an hour. We never felt rushed.  I don't really like sweets but I will come back and I do recommend this place for anyone who likes sweet desserts."}
{"text":"Pastel's interior was very cute and the food came in large portions but so big that I was unable to finish half of it. I had the sweet potato crepe that came with sweet potato ice cream but the sweet potato paste in the crepe was too overwhelming and strong which filled me up very quickly. The ice cream on the other hand only had coloring...there was 0 flavour to it.  My server looked as if she hated her job as well so her customer service wasn't exactly the standard but another server who also helped me out was genuine.  Overall,  the dessert looks better than it tastes."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff . Amazing looking desserts . The Nutella crepe had too much whipped cream and not enough Nutella , but for the price and the place , I really loved Pastel ."}
{"text":"Wow, I am in love with this place! Everything about this place screams amazing. I can see this place getting really busy during their peak hours though, my friend and I came at lunch time so not a lot of people eating dessert when we arrived. After we ordered though, people started coming in so my suggestion would be to come at off hours. Parking is a hassle too, but we parked in a neighbourhood not far from the place. There is also paid street parking beside it but it gets full fast.   My friend had the Sweet potato waffle with homemade sweet potato gelato and it was amazing. The waffle itself wasn't too sweet and instead the sweet potato purée added the sweet flavour to it. The gelato was really creamy, and the sweet potato flavour was subtle. I had the toasted marshmallow latte prior to having it so I had to eat a few bites to really taste the flavour of ice cream.   I had the supreme matcha crepe, which was different from the other matcha crepe on the menu because the actual crepe itself was made with matcha. Again, not overly sweet, and the matcha gelato was a very nice accompaniment to it. They ran out of the mochi that came with it so I substituted it with brownies. They weren't too sweet either and were chewy and delicious.   My toasted marshmallow latte wasn't up to my expectations though. I'm used to the one from second cup from their holiday lineup and was expecting a nice creamy touch of that for this one, but there wasn't any. Disappointingly it tasted just like a regular latte you'd get from Starbucks or something. Mediocre at best and wasn't really sweet at all.   Service was friendly and lots of smiles and attention were thrown our way. I'd definitely come back, especially during the summer!"}
{"text":"I don't usually use Yelp to write reviews, but Pastel REALLY deserves praise. It's my favourite dessert shop in Toronto! I've been here on many separate occasions, and they've never let me down.  It's a small comfortable shop along Yonge street in Willowdale. The waitresses are polite, they're fast and they've been pretty accommodating.   I've gotten waffles, crepes (of course heh) the cakes, the lattes and the iced drinks as well. I've loved everything I've gotten here, with special mention to their AMAZING crepes and very full flavoured lattes (and they draw cute latte art as well!).  If you have a sweet tooth or want a new hangout spot for your friends, Pastel is definitely a great place to check out!"}
{"text":"The turkey crepe is made from deli meat... They didn't let us change our order. Disappointment"}
{"text":"I've been Pastel a few times for dessert but recently tried this place out for lunch. Came by on   a Saturday and it was not busy. My friend and I both ordered a savory chicken crepe (each of the savory crepe dishes also comes with a side salad). The chicken crepe included cremini, spinach, swiss cheese, and a cream sauce. Like their sweet crepes, the crepe was delicious. Would not hesitate to come back for more!"}
