{"text":"I went there and wanted to try the very famous bun, then I found out it was just a name and little relationship. The portion was considerable small and pricy.  Overall the taste was pretty good other than price."}
{"text":"I do like my baos and this place is designed as a fast food chinese breakfast type of place. I tried the baos and few appetizers. Will stick to their baos personally. We got the signature baos and they were great! Since they are not made to order you can get them pretty quickly so great if you're in a hurry. The fact that they are pre-made though doesn't detract from overall quality so no worries there.  The signature bao is very strongly flavoured and may induce thirst. But the dough was not too thick and the filling was relatively generous. Not sure if the other baos are as strongly flavoured. May return to try more when a craving hits. It's also open 24 hrs, so you can really go there whenever you want some good baos."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my bf. We ordered steam buns with beef and onion filling and a bowl of meat and shrimp wonton soup. We were served our order very quickly.   I typically don't eat steam buns often as I don't like bready/doughy foods but the filling was pretty good. I can't really comment on the bready part though, because I drenched it in soy sauce and vinegar.  The wonton soup could've been better. The soup and the wontons were very bland I had to pour soy sauce and vinegar into the bowl.   I'll only come back here if I'm ever craving steam buns, which is highly unlikely."}
{"text":"I didn't try the buns, but seeing how it's called Qing Feng Bun, I'm thinking maybe I should've. So I'm just reviewing on what I actually ordered and what I think of the place overall.  Food: We ordered two noodles (#29 and #33) and two drinks (Plum and Herbal). The chicken noodle was average, I've had better, and the pork pieces fat to meat ratio was horrible and we didn't end up eating it. On top of the fat, the soup was bland.   Service: The lady did not seem interested in serving us when we ordered, little eye contact, almost monotone verbal interaction. In addition, when we asked for extra bowls to share, the bowls were not dry (I'm assuming it was recently washed. Or I HOPE it was recently washed) and she dumped extra water on the ground, along the front counte, while walking towards our table.  Value: The portions were extremely small for the price. We spent $25 and I don't know if we can even consider what we order enough food for one person.  Overall: Needless to say, we will not be visiting again, bun or no bun."}
{"text":"I am really torn on how to rate this restaurant because I had both bad and good moments on my first visit here last night.   Good moments: Waitress was friendly and the buns were fantastic!  Bad moments: I was here around 12am (they are open 24 hrs), most of the buns we wanted were sold out! The old school Beijing black bean noodle was sold out as well! What we ended up ordering was terrible.   Food: 1 star for the traditional Korean cold noodle & 3.5 stars for their buns As I mentioned above, they were out of old school Beijing black bean noodle so we opted for traditional Korean cold noodle instead. I thought it would be similar to what I had at Magic Noodle so I was hopeful. The noodles were so chewy and slimy that I had to ask our waitress to cut it up for me. We left half of it uneaten and ordered more buns instead. The soup that came with the noodles were sweet and sour but in an unpleasant way. Can't quite put my finger on what's wrong with it...probably the noodles. Just plain terrible! On another note, the buns were delicious! Some of the best I have had. I would rate them 4 stars but had to chip off 0.5 stars because all the buns served to our table were only slightly warm. I actually don't like my buns to be finger-burning hot anyway, but when it comes just warm to the touch, it doesn't seem very fresh. But who am I kidding? Those buns were good and I will be back ONLY for the them.  Ambiance: 2.5 stars Clean and simple decor. Some wooden bench-like seats along the walls. Large square tables with glass surfaces. Very casual setting. The general atmosphere in the restaurant made me forget I was still in Canada. My boyfriend and I were the only ones speaking English in the restaurant. I felt like I was in China for a minute. Who needs to fly 20 hours to go to China when you can just drive to Midland and Finch?!  Service: 3 stars The lady who mainly served our table was very friendly and even at 12am, she still had a smile on her face. So thumbs up for that! I don't actually know if she speaks any English so non-Cantonese/Mandarin speakers beware. My boyfriend was able to get our order in through broken Mandarin and some Cantonese. There is another guy (maybe the chef?) who comes out with the noodles and brings them to the table. He is a grump and just plops down the bowl of noodles and walks away. I don't know if they generally don't serve water/tea but we definitely didn't get any."}
{"text":"Qing Feng Bun is going to open 24 hours but for now they are only open from 9:30 am - 12:30 am daily.  The menu has a selection of steamed bun with different fillings, which I really recommend you to try. Unfortunately, their signature bun have a minimum order of 6 ($5.99) so I stuck with other the others one which are all reasonable priced at $1.20 or so.  I like the buns as they were all fluffy and served hot. They were not made to order but all ready to go in a huge industry steamer. Great if you want a quick fast snack. I found the filling a little dry, not as juicy as I expected and on the salty side.  There is no free tea offers. As this is more a food court street stall format. You can order a soy milk especially a hot one which is perfect for the cold weather.  I also has the Mala Noodle ??? ($3.99) It was served plain without any toppings compared to the other version I had that usually have cilantro and other toppings. It was no too mala spicy either, might have to request extra spicy if you want to have the sichuan level one accustom to.  I do like the atmosphere of an authentic Chinese local eatery. You order in front or you just shout out what you want to the waitress when she walked by. After just pay at the cashier.  If you can speak Mandarin, you might find the experience more enjoyable. I guess I need to work on my language skill a little more!  Cash only!"}
