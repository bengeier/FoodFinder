{"text":"Pros: Environment, waitress service Not so con: Asian Chicken Sesame Salad Cons: Not know their Wi-Fi password   Is it a good restaurant for kids? No Is it good choice for big groups? No Is the parking lot enough to accommodate the customers? No parking lot  Around 12:00pm after I found that the St Lawrence market does not open on Mondays, I started to find a good place to have lunch on Old Toronto and I discover the The Corner Place. When we arrived, we could sit on any place because the place was not crowded.  The service was friendly and nice and the salad did not take so much time to arrive. But, at least, for me, when I arrive at place where the Wi-Fi is available I like to have access. I tried all the variations provided by the waitress and none worked. On the end, she asked me to look for one of the customers and ask him how they connect. Very bad negative point for me. Overall, the salad was okay. To be true, I prefer the Asian Chicken Sesame salad from Panera Bread. The dried noodle was very hard to eat and most of the salad components were cut in chunks instead of niece pieces to eat with a fork. What makes a mess while you are eating. Well... I did not get excited with the food this time. But I intend to come back here again next time that I visit Toronto, I notice other dishes on the menu that called my attention."}
{"text":"Possibly one of my favorite spots in Toronto.   As an outsider of the area, I was actually very impressed. My girlfriend and I had a bet, I am not a big fan of winging restaurants and would rather research and gain insight, while she is more spontaneous. The rule was, once she drops the ball by finding a lackluster restaurant, i'll have the right to venture toward my guide, yelp.   Ambiance-We ate outside on the patio, the location is ideal but the seating arrangement was too tight to my liking. I prefer not hearing what my next door neighbor was discussing but you make do.   Service-We actually received great service. No complaints.   Food/Drinks: 1) The Pulled Brisket Sandwich is absolutely delicious. A high recommendation when ordering. The pork was soft and flavorful.   Price: The price was mid-range. Not terribly expensive and more in line with pub pricing."}
{"text":"Lovely patio, nice waiters Brunch is very delicious Same with the chicken avocado sandwich :)"}
{"text":"I come here Sundays with my friends for a laid back brunch . Mimosas are cheap $3 and brunch is also well priced.  I've had the eggs Benny And the tortilla Benny- I think it's called .. Both tasty, food always seems to be a little cold here but not a big deal. Coffee was a little disappointing so decided to stick to the mimosas.  Lunch items were okay , have had the pesto pasta before - good and the burger- OK. I'm looking forward to the patio being open as its a great location and drinks are cheap!"}
{"text":"It's okay, but unless you like cigarette smoke and ashes with your food & dirty dishes to eat off of, you might not want to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday while visiting Toronto and loved it! Good drink specials from 3-7, the food was great and reasonably priced (had a delicious jerk chicken sandwich) and the ambiance and atomsphere was relaxed and laid back. Waitress was very friendly and they had really good music too."}
{"text":"Came for a friends birthday because she said her friend was djing at an event. Old school / r&b / hip hop mix . Space was kinda small but good enough to dance and mingle with the mature crowd ."}
{"text":"I ordered the jerk chicken burger.  It was okay.  The jerk spices and the mango salsa on top was pretty good but the actual chicken was too chew and too dry for my liking.  My bf had the ribs and found them to be too dry and just average.  The patio is very nice but unfortunately I chose to sit under a tree and had leaves falling into my food.  I would def chose a different seat next time.    As the menu is pretty varied and seemed interesting I'd give it another go and try the poutine next time."}
{"text":"Growing up in Asia you get to experience some awesome cuisine. The Corner Place's modern Canadian / Malaysian dishes are delicious! In a pub!? I never expected to find such authentic cuisine on Front Street! A fantastic menu that is regularly updated, a chilled space with some fun interior design, and a great drinks list make this a place to try out.  Excellent service, great food and everything you could want to drink... Try it out!"}
{"text":"Last week I came to 'The Corner Place' with three friends from out of town. Though I had previously been here for their 'Happy hour specials' I never had a chance to try the food. Our waitress who then introduced herself as 'Michelle' gave us a rundown on the specials and provided us with some good insight on the beers on tap and the locals for my friends. She also took the time to make a cocktail for one of my friends , though it turned out to be $12 a pop she was happy very satisfied with the 'gin and prosecco mix' perfect for a hot summer afternoon. This place wouldn't strike you a 'Gourmet' type of cuisine but God I was wrong. After some drinks the waitress recommended food for our table to share and decided to go for the fried calamari, Brisket Poutine  which was FANTASTIC, Deep fried pork and carnita tacos! I am definitely coming back for that poutine and the super friendly and distinguished service at The Corner Place!"}
{"text":"Worst place in the St.Lawerence Market area. If you're looking for a dive bar with bathroom drug use, drug deals, and drunk Management by all means. The food is bland and and The seafood I ordered had gone bad. I was ever given a hard time when I complained about it. Moving on, when you walk towards the stairs you get a glimpse of a dirty overflowing with dishes area and it smells foul. It's quite the turn off and makes you realize how unsanitary the food in the place is. The basement smells like Mold and you can tell the place hasn't been cleaned in years. The bathrooms had urine on the floor and some puke as well. The female staff do not seem to care and are rude. Clearly this isn't a place to be. Drink specials does NOT make up for the horrendous experience you will have here.    Do your self a favour and avoid this place! There are far better bars to chose from in Toronto."}
{"text":"I walked into here to grab a pint or two on Christmas eve. The bartender wouldn't pour the beer until I paid him. I don't look like trash. I don't understand why I was treated like a criminal. It was my first time in the place. I paid for my pint and decide to leave right after. The bartender was on his cell phone the whole time and shot me a few dirty looks. I walk up and ask him if it's common for him to request that customers pay before they get served. Maybe I'm being mistaken for someone that previously ran out on their bill. He told me some customers are asked to pay up front. I asked what made me one of the some customers and he told me he's not comfortable discussing it with me and I can discuss it with the manager. Then he walked away and went back to playing on his cell phone. He never came and checked on me. I've never had a place treat a customer so poorly. My business wasn't welcome here. And I was denied an explanation. I work in the service industry. I'm a great customer. I didn't deserve that."}
{"text":"This place gets five stars for so many reasons. First of all the food is awesome and they have one of the best patios in the city. Its a fair size with big tables and a shady side and a sunny side. Thanks to the retractable awning you can even sit out here comfortably in the rain. The patio at the corner place is a fantastic spot for people watching and right across the street from the St.Lawrence Market. The staff here are friendly and cool and the owners and management are very supportive of the  local students."}
{"text":"Possibly the only good thing about this place is the service, which was attentive and friendly.  My main issue is that I  find it completely inexcusable for a restaurant to serve Chilean Sea Bass when it's widely known that this fish is endangered and has been for some time. Seriously, in a city as environmentally aware as Toronto, and uber close to the St. Lawrence market, could you be more retarded? http://www.seachoice.org/profile/3 I wanted to give this place a try, but won't be returning."}
{"text":"Good bar, better patio and cheap drinks. The \"live music\" is terrible, but that shouldn't stop you visiting. They're still trying to figure out what kind of bar they want to be - redecorating every few months."}
{"text":"will go back. the food was very good. I went with a bunch of friends, and we all thoroughly enjoyed our meals. service was great .. always smiling, attentive, and polite. the indoor decor was sophisticated, but it was a relaxing dining experience on a summer evening ... and bonus points for having the jays game on as cecil shut down tampa bay."}
{"text":"Food and service were ok. They were really busy that day but service took a long time like an hour. It's just another bar but the patio is nice. I would go back considering the expensive options in the area."}
{"text":"A few friends and I dropped in here just before Christmas having walked from the Distillery District in the cold looking for an interesting but reasonably priced place for dinner.  This was definitely worth the walk :) The wait staff was very friendly, the atmosphere was classier and more modern than your typical casual-dining place - but the prices were in same same ballpark which is always appreciated by a student like myself :)  I had the fettuccine alfredo since I was so hungry after our meandering walk. I am definitely not an expert on the dish since this was the first time I had order it, but it seemed well put together to me: the chicken was nicely done and the sauce was smooth. The portions were generous.  I would definitely go back if I was in the neighborhood again. I hope they finish their website soon - I always enjoying researching where I am going to eat and seeing updates :)"}
{"text":"Go to place for brunch! Cheap mimosas and delicious breakfast! Definitely a great place if you're looking for a good atmosphere and good service. Really cool inside and big patio outside. Really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Went to The Corner Place in Toronto today for their $4 tacos! Amazing! In my opinion every taco is beautiful but these ones were super model tacos. The service was just kind of OK though. We were a party of seven and the server forgot one of our guest's meals. When we asked for separate bills she kind of complained a little about it. Oh well. The tacos were good enough that we didn't really mind!"}
{"text":"I chose The Corner Place, sight unseen, for a milestone (read: 19th!) birthday gathering with a few close friends. I NEEDED a restaurant that served good food, tasty drinks, and accommodated for a student's budget. I WANTED a restaurant with a slightly classier atmosphere than my friends and I are used to. The Corner Place turned out to be just about a perfect pick.   We're greeted at the entrance by the restaurant's fully stocked and modern looking bar. The lights are low (but not to the point that you can't make out your date - don't you just hate that?!) and on this particular night the music selection is ambient and subtle. My friend remarked that the music reminded him of the underwater levels in Donkey Kong. Okay, it might have seemed a little silly to a bunch of youngsters like us, but I don't think it took away from the dining experience at all. The decor was rich and modern, without feeling sterile or overly trendy. Warm colours and woods. Inviting!  The food was great! I ordered the grilled salmon (about $12) and my friends had the curry chicken (about $12) and the ribs (about $15). We were all thoroughly impressed with the quality of the food but left wanting more... literally. The portions were a bit small.   The birthday girl (moi) was treated to the dulce de leche cheesecake for dessert. No complaints, other than the fact that it was served presumably right out of the freezer and was perhaps a touch harder than cheesecake should be. Tasted great, though.  We went on a Tuesday night and it was very quiet. I live nearby, however, and see a pretty packed house on weekend evenings. Check it out on a weeknight with your sweetheart or on a Saturday with a group of friends!  Our waitress was helpful, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The only negative thing I'll say about this particular dining experience is that a couple staff members were sitting at the bar around a laptop. I know it was a slow night, but c'mon! That's not appropriate.   That aside, the meal and experience were great and I definitely plan on returning!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch after a long run was a blessing as my runch buddies and I were famished by the time we finished our run.  The Corner Place is just a short walk from Yonge and Wellington and the food is always delicious at reasonable prices.  Service is friendly and attentive, but not intrusive.  Plus they're able to accommodate food orders due to allergies without much of a fuss or roll of the eyes.  We all ordered the Carnita Sandwich ($12.99) and it was absolutely delish.  The bun got a little bit greasy from the brisket, but the flavours just melts in your mouth and the fried egg adds a nice consistency to the sandwich.  Plus more protein for us runners which we weren't complaining about.  Also they had $3.50 mimosas, so it was a no brainer that we all ordered one or two mimosas which definitely complemented the meal nicely.  Only complaint was we all wished there were more hash potatoes and fruits on our plates.  I've only ever gone for brunch and it was always delicious, so cannot comment on their dinners, but will eventually try it one day.  In addition, I cannot wait until patio season as they have a good patio out front which is great for people watching in St. Lawrence Market and catching some sunshine."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch and Ceasers! All the food is super fresh, great friendly staff and a fun patio. The potato hashbrowns were to die for and fresh fruit is served with all the meals. Great way to spend a lazy Saturday morning."}
{"text":"This place is the perfect location for everything.   After coming for dinner here with a bunch of my girlfriends I decided that the venue and location are perfect for events!  I spoke to the owner and he was great! He sat down with me, worked out a drink special that could help fundraise for my cause as well as worked out a perfect catering menu for my guests.   The service and the help during the set up for the event and the event itself was a success and I owe that a lot to the team at The Corner Place. They even bought one of our auctioned paintings to support the event itself!!!!  I love the weekly drink specials and found myself going back to The Corner Place to visit with the owners as well as fill my guilty pleasure of sliders and edamame beans."}
{"text":"Food is not bad...standard fair.  They do have Sapporo on draft which is cool...  It probably has one of the best patios in the area so in the summer, it is usually packed."}
{"text":"I always like going to places with a lame name.  The bar The restaurant  The Corner place  It just feels very homie to me when they put up a humble name like that and not try to hype you up  I also liked the outside of this place, they put up lights all around the patio, lined up nicely and gave me that left over Christmas feeling on a cold January night.  Walking in on a Friday night at around 7ish, no problem in finding a table for two but the restaurant was 90% filled up w drinkers at the bar and also diners.   This place has drink specials everyday and $3.50 mimosa during brunch. I m a big fan of mimosa but was disappointed to find out the special price is only available during day time. $7 at night time. I mean... Ok so you are indirectly telling me just get the other drinks. We don't wanna serve you mimosas.   They have an interesting menu, a lot to choose from, and the server helped us w it. She recommended the Malaysian curry w garlic rice, which was really good. The curry was very flavorful and creamy w generous amount of chicken. Jasmine rice was lightly stir fried w garlic and I believe a bit of coconut milk. It just went really well w the curry. I would not have imagined a corner bar could deliver this quality of Asian food. Solid food! The only complaint is that they gave way too little rice and my rice was gone before my curry :(  I'll definitely come back for their daily drink specials (see picture I posted) and other food items on their interesting menu. Overall, I liked the vibe here. Oh I like watching sports and they have enough TVs all around the bar. Guys, you are welcome here to catch a game."}
{"text":"This afternoon, June 19th.2016 we visited the above referenced establishment. Check# 317852 was presented at our Table#33 by \"Carla\" at 14;59 PM.The Food and Beverage sub-total before HST (828289546) was $43.97 which included $10 for beer. The HST was: $5.72. Below the hst was a line which said \"bottle service\" (We had no bottle just two glasses) and charged $7.91 for a Grand Total of $57.60.  When we questioned the server she said that this charge \"just came up\" and that it was the included \"service charge\" on the $43.97 ??? There were just three of us and no identification of an automatic charge (sometimes leveled over 6 or 8 people at a table) so the consumer would leave an additional service charge on top of the almost 20% ALREADY charged to them and not identified as such.  This is a clear rip off of consumers and a total turn off to our tourists who generally regard Canadians as honest and trust worthy and we spend a lot of marketing dollars to attract to our City and our Country.  Shame on this fraudulent and totally illegal conduct of this \"Operator\"!   I trust you will have this sort of misleading conduct corrected."}
{"text":"Would not go back. Great location and patio. Wait staff friendly but not very attentive. Patrons douchey and out of control. Fries arrive cold. Chicken in the coconut thai dish was gristly. Not much meat on the pork frites. Thoroughly mediocre and don't go in the evening unless you want an Entertainment District experience."}
{"text":"Greasy and over buttered hamburgers for $10. Fries and salad are extra cost. I ordered the avocado and chicken sandwich, the avocado was way too ripe and all I could really taste was the butter. Service was good though, just wouldn't come back again due to quality and pricing."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best, but the drinks specials were a great call as well as the consistent cheap Jamesons. However, the service was on point and special, I think the only reason my friends and I keep returning. Shout out to Lia!!"}
{"text":"Although I consider this out of the way from my usual haunts i usually make the visit after work to see friends for a drink.  Their happy hour prices are nothing to write home about, consider the much better options around the area.  What i do like is some of the snack food on offer and the vibe of the place, i am never sure what to expect with the crowd but there always seems to be a lively atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing food great bar very nice n catering staff... I went to toronto for my first time for a week and ended up spending most my time here.. Loved the chop brisket sandwich and poutine fries were off the charts! The fish tacos were plump n delicious... I tried the basa fish and that was great.. Fried Cornish hens is a must but the brisket reminded me of home in the south! Only needed collard greens n cornbread and it WOULDA been better than the south! CHARLES the owner is an amazingly sweet well pounced educated mammoth so much character n history great guy get to know this place it's my home away from home!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and experience. It's right across from the St. Lawrence market and it was perfect weather for outdoor dining. Our waitress said she was new to the city and just started but she was fantastic! I ordered a coke and avocado chicken sandwich with fries and it was great!"}
{"text":"I purchased a Wag Jag Express certificate for a hamburger and fries take-out order for $8 so I saved $6.69.  Burger was moist and delicious although they did put cheese on it in error after I told them 3x, NO CHEESE! Luckily it was a thin piece of crappy processed cheese so I didn't notice the taste.  The fries taste/smell similar to Swiss Chalet fries but crispy. It took 15 minutes to make since this place is a restaurant first, take-out second. I did call in advance to see if I could order on the phone but they never answered and their voice mail was not set up. When I got there the place was empty (2 tables being used, 3 patrons in all at 1:00 pm) and only 1 waitress and 1 bartender so I can understand why my call was missed.   Quick 13 minute walk from the Financial District."}
{"text":"This review applies to the patio/drinks only. The place is close by and seems to have a local fan base. I enjoyed my first visit here as they had Blanche De Chambly on draft which is good. Unfortunately on the second visit they were not serving that (boo!). The service is OK for what it is. I mainly drop by to have a cigar and enjoy a drink. Other than that I don't see why I would come here. They did have promo in conjunction with rainbow cinemas for meal and movie deal a while ago so that may make it worthwhile to try the food here."}
{"text":"Death metal playing from sound system. My friend got rubber bands in his salad. I ordered a chicken avocado sandwich with no tomato and they took everything off but the chicken... which was rubbery and clearly microwaved. Zero effort."}
{"text":"Went to a group dinner here and we had the whole restaurant.  For a place that's across the street from the St Lawrence market, you'd think their food would be fresh not made from frozen.  Calamari was from frozen rings, cold and too salty.  It took them 20 minutes to serve the second course - 20  minutes - so by the time the last person at my table had their food, everyone else's was cold.  Good champagne cocktails though - that's about the only positive thing I can say about this place.  Ugh."}
{"text":"They have a good atmosphere and fun motown music, but they also had some guy playing live, who wasn't very good and detracted from the experience. Their beer choices are standard and lack variety. The chicken appy was no good. The duck appy was tasty and the sweet potatoe fries were good too. Not bad for a random one off, but not good enough to make it a regular thing or a place that you plan to meet up at."}
{"text":"The patio is a lovely little spot at the corner of two major intersections. Fun for people watching and the st Lawrence market was a beautiful backdrop.  The tables were a bit old and worn out and sticky unfortunately but everything else (chairs, utensils, umbrellas) were fine.  Service was a bit lacking, on no fault of the waitress. She was trying very hard (and she was lovely and upbeat) but they really do need an extra body with how many patrons and tables were full on the patio.   The food itself was delicious. A good amount of standard brunch choices. We had the chicken and waffles as well as the corner place breakfast. I loved the choice of fruits and they were all super fresh. The chicken was juicy and crunchy but with just the right amount of batter and the waffle was the perfect complement. Nothing stood out particularly about my breakfast but it was a hefty portion and I liked the way they did the home fries.   One small thing but they didn't have salt/pepper shakers on the table and I really like pepper on my eggs. But with how busy our server was, I didn't bother asking for it.   Overall would come again but a few small things that made it only an ok experience as opposed to a good one."}
{"text":"Possibly one of my new favorites!   Ambiance - perfect! Cute little patio outside, lots of space. Umbrellas, etc.   Service - awesome. Our server was super friendly without being overbearing, happy to answer all my questions and our orders were brought in a finely manner. This girl was a pro! :)   Food/drinks - delish! Ordered a mimosa and my co-diner ordered a palm beach which came in a mason jar. I grabbed a jerk chicken sandwich which was super tasty, aside from the chicken itself being a wee bit dry.   Shall be back for sure. :)"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. Nice laid back atmosphere. Sat at the outdoor bar, eating my breakfast fajitas and eggs benedict while watching people go to the Lawrence market. Food was simple and yummy. Service was great- waiters made sure we were taken care of."}
{"text":"Came here for some late night grub with the gf.  We ordered the guacamole and chips, Mexican street corn, and the fish taco.  The guacamole and corn were both extremely tasteless. Each had no flavour, so we left over half of both the dishes. The taco was okay, and it was a good size.  The service was okay, nothing great. It was two people who were running both the bartenders and the servers. So there was a lot of time they didn't notice is and I had to get up to get their attention.  Overall, place sucked for food."}
{"text":"4 star food, 2-1/2 star service.  The Corner Place is located across from the St. Lawrence Market.  There is a patio which is great for people watching and for soaking in some Vitamin D.  I treated my co-worker here to lunch as she is always helpful and does it with a smile.  Its rare these days to find people who do not mind rolling up their sleeves to get the job done.  I love you JH!  We arrived at around 1PM to a pretty full patio.  After 5 minutes of being totally ignored by their wait staff, we were finally approached and the girl told us it would be just 5 minutes for them to prepare the table.  We were finally seated, and again ignored for a few good moments until our orders were taken.I ordered the Jerk Chicken Burger with a side salad.  I usually shy away from chicken burgers because they're made with chicken breasts, which tend to be a bit on the dry side.  I was pleasantly surprised to sink my teeth into a juicy and tender chicken burger.  The bun was fresh, the burger was flavourful and the mango salsa that accompanied it was the perfect complement to the bit of zing of the jerk marinade.  The side salad could use some improvement as it was just a few pieces of romaine lettuce sloppily drizzled with some balsamic vinegar and olive oil.  Pretty boring.  Of course, I could've opted for fries, but chose to be healthier :pJH ordered the Corner Place Cheeseburger which was adorned with sauteed mushrooms and onion.  I thought the beef patty erred on the smaller side but as JH commented, this was a good thing as the larger burger patty soaked up all the juices so that we wouldn't have needed a Tide 2 Go stick for the aftermath.  The burger was perfectly cooked with a bit of pink still inside.  It was a homemade burger as opposed to a store-bought burger which is given away by its outer appearance (e.g. Encrusted with herbs).  Verdict:  Prices are reasonable considering the area in which The Corner Place is located.  The burgers were $11 and $13 and the portion sizes were sufficient.  I would definitely recommend it for anyone in the area.  However, if you are looking to grab a quick bite, you might want to go elsewhere as the service here is rather lax. I loved their patio as it was spaced apart enough to allow for privacy, and is the perfect way to enjoy a meal on a Summer's day.  The food was delicious, and I will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the calamari and the caprese salad, although the actual caprese wasn't outstanding, the salad itself was really good.  The bar had a good ambiance and is in a really good location.  Would go again."}
{"text":"I love this place. There's not much options for affordable good food with a patio that isn't rammed with people, has good atmosphere and isn't over priced.   The Corner place is on the Corner of Jarvis and Front. Even with happy hour (beers for $3) the place was full, but not crowded. We sat on the patio.   The service is super friendly, and attentive. You just look at the servers and they walk over to you. Good job.   Very rarely I like asian food when not made in an Asian restaurant. I dislike, normally, ethic food on a regular bar menu. But, they do it really good here.  I've had the Malaysian Curry multiple times, and it's full of flavour and highly recommended.   I also got the Spaghetti Carbonara. It was creamy, but not enough to make me feel sick afterward. It comes with smoked bacon, shrimp and veggies.   If I'm in the area, it's one of the few places I'll be willing to go!   The portion sizes are perfect, for a girl. The guys needed the apps and dessert to be sated. Can't wait for another excuse to come back here!"}
{"text":"I wanted a beer with my lunch, start off my day off bar hopping and drinking. Didn't want to go gabby near by due to my bad experience so I ended up here  Food was alright I had cp cheese burger. The way it was dress was meh. The patty was allmost rare.  If I didn't like medium rare I would sent it back. Fries weren't good  Meh food didn't match the price"}
{"text":"This place was really cute. A couple of my friends and I were in the area and they suggested this place. We were seated on the patio, it was a bit small but still cute. There was no place to hang or place my purse, which was disappointing because I had to hold it on my shoulder for the entire night. The service was great, the atmosphere was good. I ordered the organic burger with fries. The fries were great, the burger was weirdly shaped and didnt hold well with the bun. I ended up eating it with a fork and knife. Anyways, it was good but I can say I have definetly had better downtown. I would reccommend this place if you were just to grab drinks and go elsewhere for food."}
{"text":"Nice place to people watch while sitting outside. The tuna and mango salad was excellent and the Bao's were very tasty. Friendly service made the visit very nice."}
{"text":"Love this place for brunch and the sidewalk patio is perfect for watching the craziness of St Lawrence Market across the street. I've tried several of the eggs bene variations and the eggs have always been perfected poached. They also have $3.50 mimosas. My only complaint is that the coffee is a bit bitter.  The service is polite and prompt."}
{"text":"Im giving this place 5/5 for excellent service + food. Walked in and instantly were greeted by some great hosts and servers. Had great recommendations for some GOOD food. Friendly environment (including the manager) and jugged down 2 pitches of Margarita's. Service and food is all I ask when I go out nad that's exactly what I got. Highly recommend the Chicken Gyoza and Japanese Fried Chicken Tacos.  A bit pricey, but worth it for the quality. I didn't like the live music, but that's because I love my rap music, and I wasn't expecting them to accommodate for me."}
{"text":"Only had the torched poutine and it was amazing! Smokey, great depth of flavor, herbaceous, tender brisket and, ooey gooey cheese curds topped with scallions."}
{"text":"After writing my first review of this restaurant, I was contacted by one of the owners to invite my husband and I back to redeem themselves. I thought \"wow, what customer service\", but my first instincts about the place were clearly not wrong!  I don't typically go back to a place after being disappointed, but thought I'd give it a shot after receiving this email. Unfortunately I wasn't able to make the reservation I booked and emailed to reschedule for this past Sunday Nov 23rd. My email was sent Nov 4th and I never received a response back. So in addition to being disappointed with the food the first time, I'm now disappointed in what seems like an insincere email that was supposed to rectify the situation. In this case, more damage was done, which I assume wasn't the intent, but unfortunately that leaves me no choice but to reduce the rating from 2 to 1. Poor customer service and poor food experience... Such a shame."}
{"text":"I was at The Corner Place for a private party last night, this rating is more so directed at an individual rather than the establishment itself -- unfortunately, the actions of this individual made my experience a bad one. One of the bartenders, (I wish I had other ways of identifying who she was -- like a name -- but unfortunately the only thing I remember specifically is she was wearing black, had her hair up and is of East-Asian descent) -- this bartender was extremely rude to all of the guests. I appreciate serving/bartending is exhausting and servers often have to deal with rude customers, I try to always be patient and tip every time I order. However, this bartender would snap in our faces, hit the table with her hands, and roll her eyes if we didn't respond to her right away. Many people at the party were upset by her behaviour. It made me not want to order any more drinks (she behaved like this repeatedly towards everyone there). Her attitude and demeanor was condescending and disrespectful. This is definitely not the correct way to treat customers and I won't be returning due to this experience."}
{"text":"Went here after a long day with a couple friends, and was I ever pleased! The service was great, and the atmosphere was awesome. I didn't get around to eating anything but we were on the patio and it was truly delightful. They play some awesome throwbacks too. Hoping to return there again!"}
{"text":"The food and service are terrible. We stopped by for brunch, had to wait for at least 30 mins for the food to arrive, without cutlery. Add 10 mins to the wait for that. The smoked salmon benny was disappointing. Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"The fried chicken tacos+sesame bowl is SO good. They have good draft beers + strong cocktails as well. The patio is so cute with picnic benches and high stool tables. I don't think there are many places that can accommodate 20+ people and still have lots of seating left over (probably since the patio's pretty big). I'll definitely be coming back soon for some patio action."}
{"text":"i have been here a few times and i am always impressed every time i leave.  The food is really good and for a fair price and the service is pretty bang on.  Not to mention the great beer on tap on the patio on a summer day...ahhh pleasant.   i would come back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here for a party. The food was delicious and the drinks well made. It's a pretty tiny venue, so I guess it would be nice for a romantic dinner.   Bar staff was a bit inattentive as they kept talking to each other before I finally managed to get their attention so that was kind of annoying... but it's a small gripe. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The marketplace was closed on Monday, so our group of 4 when here for lunch instead. We sat outside since it was a beautiful day and enjoyed the venue. Their staff was very attentive and helpful in giving advice to us as tourists. The mine offers up an interesting variety of foods including some Caribbean, Malaysian, and Asian dishes. I chose the Malaysian coconut curry which turned out to be a solid choice."}
{"text":"Tasty brunch option near the St Lawrence Market - we were drawn in by $3 mimosas, and had a fantastic meal, some creative and unique brunch options and friendly prompt service."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!  I can't believe the servers that work there are still employed. My sister and friend stopped by here on Sunday afternoon for lunch and seeing as how the patio was pretty much empty we thought we'd get decent service. But that was not the case. Our server would literally not even wait for us to finish our sentence before she was running away into the restaurant. When placing my order a burger with a house salad, she didn't even ask me what side I wanted (choice between fries or salad) and when I had to stop her from leaving our table so I could say I wanted it with a salad her response is 'no problem we can do that for you' as if I'm asking for something that's not already an option to me. Of course when I get my burger (almost 10min after my friends got their food) I see she's given me fries. She dropped my food down so fast and turned to leave I again had to quickly call her back to the table. When I told her my order was wrong her response was not 'I'm sorry' but you can keep the fries I'll bring the salad in a tone as if I was inconveniencing her from her shitty idea of serving. No one came by to ask how our food was and it took incredibly long to even get someone to bring our bills which was another joke. They overcharged my friend on her edamame and when she asked what the correct price for them was as she's pointing to it in the menu (this was now another server not our original one) this rude server instead of saying sorry that's my fault I'll change your bill instead says 'sure I'll give you a dollar' as if my friend was being cheap for asking for her bill to be looked at. If this is the type of staff you keep, I can guarantee you won't be in business for much longer. They truly lack ANY kind of customer service abilities and actually don't know how to speak to people in general. Not something you want for your customer facing staff. Needless to say I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great patio. They have Sapporo on tap which is awesome.  Ate here a few times and the food is pretty good.  Service is a bit slow as there always seems to be one too few wait staff.  Overall a good spot if you aren't in a hurry."}
{"text":"A-OK! This bar gave off a lively vibe and the servers here were really friendly and attentive even when it got really busy on a Friday evening. The bar just next door was packed and didn't even acknowledge us, so we ultimately left. Whereas this place greeted us as soon as we walked in.   A good selection of beer at a fair price and food selection was interesting. The food options are good for sharing because you're able to try a lot more of the menu. My boyfriend and I ordered the JFC Taco and Braised Brisket Poutine.   The food was fresh and arrived in a timely manner. The Poutine was served in a stone pot which kept the Poutine hotter for a longer period. It was tasty and the brisket was delicious. The JFC taco came with two tacos, the chicken was lightly battered and it had just the right of spice. It wasn't overwhelming and this is great for a snack or as a main entree.   Downfall is the bathrooms are located downstairs but they were clean and tidy when I went. Not sure how it is on other nights. Overall, this place is a hidden gem with good food, drinks and a lively atmosphere. Perfect for a night out with friends."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a bite to eat during my time in Toronto decided to sit outside because the weather was nice. I notice a woman with the taco entrée so I asked the server if I can have exactly what she had, and my server told me that was the fish taco when it arrived it didn't look like the same thing that the woman was eating needless to say I was slightly disappointed that either she gave me the wrong information or the kitchen mess that my order. My boyfriend ordered the grilled chicken wings with fries and I ordered the fish tacos with onion rings the fish on the tacos was small with plenty of greens but I ate it anyway and my onion rings were delicious."}
{"text":"I wished the Corner Place was a place around my corner!  COST I only went in for drinks and I'd say prices are quite reasonable for such a fancy place.  They have $5 specials each day of the week  - $5 Martini Mondays - $5 Vodka Saturdays etc.  ATMOSPHERE Fantastic! The place is filled with beautiful artwork and photography.  High ceilings and a patio outside for warmer weather.  There is this classy feel to the place but not a \"stuck up, you are not welcomed\" feel feel b/c you're of a lower income bracket.  BARTENDERS A bit overly attentive. I feel like she asked if we needed anything more than 6 times that night interrupting me and my company who were deep in conversation.  NOISE The only potential issue I can see is the place getting very loud. The walls don't really absorb the sounds of your neighbour's  conversation but the place wasn't too busy when we were there so it wasn't an issue."}
{"text":"Start of the summer time swing, and this place has a great patio and for those who have nothing better to do, it's a day time people watching spot.   Been a few times, and the food is good, haven't been disappointed yet. The old faithfuls - Cobb Salad and Jerk Chicken sandwich.   Bonus is that they have weekday happy hour drink specials 3-7...   A place for everyone. It's the atmosphere and happy staff that will win you over for sure."}
{"text":"patio patio patio. patio season is here and I am on the prowl for them fresh patios.  Seriously, with $3 mimosas, you can't really go wrong. I was already destined to like this place before I stepped foot in (well...to be technical, I guess I can't actually say I stepped in as we stayed on the patio the entire time... but let's pretend).  Food was quite good. I appreciate their attempt to innovate with brunch food. They have the classic eggs benny, two eggs any style, etc choices, but they also have pretty cool ideas like breakfast in a pot (which is just a pot that comes out with a whole bunch of breakfast food scrambled together--looked quite good).  I got the spanish tortilla benny, which comes with two crispy tortillas and two poached eggs, salsa, guac, etc. At first I was unable to figure out how to eat the concoction, but I just gave up with the knife after a while and just picked it up and ate it. Definitely would recommend it for someone who wants to switch up the ole brunch routine.  Waitress was really friendly and attentive--nothing but nice things to say about her. All in all, a successful brunch endeavour! Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Tried to have brunch here on 9/14/14 but received no attention from the staff. Sat down, waited 10-15mins before waving down a waitress to take our drink orders, after another 10-15mins we still did not receive any menus so I went inside and retrieved them myself. By this time another couple had sat down beside us and were receiving the same poor service. It was another 10-15mins until the waitress came to take their orders and I had to get her attention that we hadn't placed our orders yet nor received our drinks we order nearly a half hour ago. After waiting another 15mins and not receiving any drinks, we decided to leave. The couple next to us were debating the same thing. I informed the bartender inside (since a waitress couldn't be found) that we were leaving but he could have cared less and made no attempt to persuade us to stay.  Overall, the place was extremely short staffed to handle the Sunday crowd. It's a shame because the food that was being served looked very good."}
{"text":"Quick service! The calamari is really good. The staff was also very friendly as soon as we arrived."}
{"text":"Stand by my 4 star rating. Went again for their drink specials, wasn't disappointed at all. Cheap, good alcohol+friendly service+nice ambiance + company= good times!"}
{"text":"One of the friendliest bars in Toronto!  Patio is perfect for a typical warm Toronto evening. Place is a magnet for people who just want to talk and get to know each other, a networking heaven if you wish!   I am a wine drinker so I was expecting the usual bar for which is average but not exceptional. That being said the wine List feature the rose that I fell in love with!    The service is super and the menu items delivered warm and promptly  every time.   Tonight I was there they had a simply fantastic DJ, made the night for me and many others around me."}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. AWFUL. I would give no stars if I could. The service is beyond neglectful, the sangria tastes like something you drank in your teens (over-sweet and fruity), the food takes forever to come out and is not at all worth the wait.   We hit the patio here a couple of Friday's ago for dinner. I should have known better when I saw someone standing doing shots with a table - turns out she worked there. The menu looked promising and we ordered two different types of tacos. The jerk chicken and the shrimp. It took half an hour to come to the table - actually, just dropped on to the table. At first glance it was glaringly obvious that it had been sitting awhile in the kitchen. The taco shells were hardened around the edges and they were cold. Also, the menu states that the tacos are gluten free. The shrimp tacos showed up with fried egg noodles on them. It took me another 10 minutes to get the attention of someone to inquire and have them take them away. We asked for the check. That never came. After 15 minutes we went inside and stood waiting for it.  Their only saving grace is the nice big patio out front! It was an hour and a half wasted, we left still hungry and had to go elsewhere for dinner"}
{"text":"While the frosty weather now prevents us from enjoying the Front St. sidewalk patio of The Corner Place during these cool months, the floor to ceiling windows make people watching just as easy. Despite the lack of warm weather in the winter, we can still count on the $4 highball specials. Perhaps it's because I'm usually visiting quite late on weeknights (after movies at Rainbow Marketplace), but it hasn't been very busy.  Depsite there being so much choice, the hightops are always the most fun to sit on. Food-wise, I've only tried the grilled calamari. It was drenched in sweet teriyaki sauce which drowned the bed of mixed greens it lay upon. I don't think that I would necessarily make trips here for the food, but I've heard good things about their steaks."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place a 2.5 stars, but I feel 3 is too generous.  We came here for Saturday brunch. The patio was the perfect spot as it was not too shady and not too sunny. Service was fine, nothing exceptional but not lacking in any way.  We ordered 2 mimosas, at $3 we thought it was a great deal. Unfortunately, my glass had some sort of dust stuck on the inside of the glass. The server was appropriately apologetic and changed it quickly when I showed it to her. The drinks were a good pour of prosecco.  We ordered the Spanish Tortilla Benny and the Eggs Benedict with Peameal Bacon (the menu online isn't updated). I didn't really enjoy my pick of Spanish Tortilla Benny. Firstly, it is misnamed. I think it would be more apt to call it Huevos Racheros as there is nothing Continental Spain about this dish. Secondly, I did not enjoy the deep fried tortilla. I thought it would be pan crisped, so it was disappointing to see two beige, oily discs. My guy enjoyed his order of Eggs Benedict with Peameal Bacon but he was always quite hungry and said \"the fruit cup and rosti was the best part of the meal\"...so take what you will out of that statement.   The fruit cup is pretty unique and delicious but could do with a light dusting of powdered sugar. The rosti was good but I don't think it was fresh.  Overall, it was just fine and I didn't feel like we threw away money eating here. But I'd definitely not be back anytime soon. I feel like The Corner Place could do more with their menu based on their proximity to St. Lawrence Market and it's culinary uniqueness."}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner our first night in Toronto. I had the pineapple salmon and a beer. I thought the food was good and reasonably priced. I would come back again if I was in town as it was an easy walk from the hotel."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch and left satisfied. The food was delicious but more importantly it came blazingly fast. Probably the fastest I have ever had at a brunch spot. Almost fast-food fast. I was actually quite shocked at the speed. The waitress was also super friendly."}
{"text":"Went for a drink and some food the other day with friends and the service and staff were amazing! I think Caitlin was her name, she took care of us completely with all our requests and I can't give praise enough to her. Excellent food and service. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"We went to the Corner Place on a whim, on Friday night. My boyfriend is a huge advocate of planning where we will eat, but I decided we should wing it. It turned out winging it sometimes leads you to the best places, hence, this restaurant.  When we walked onto the patio at about ten pm, the waitress told us we could \"pick any seat!\" We looked around and it looked like every seat was taken. After scoping out the scene further, we found one little table nestled in between a large party of fifteen or so, and another party of four. Not a problem! I love a busy restaurant!  My boyfriend ordered a beer,and I ordered a Caesar. It was the BEST Caesar I've had in a coon's age! It had a spicy kick, and I downed it like a champ!  We ordered spring rolls as an appetizer, which were a little small, but delicious none-the-less. As we were waiting for our mains, I couldn't help but eavesdrop on our neighbouring table. The man was drunk and proceeded to stumble past us and strike up a conversation with the big party of fifteen. Everyone seemed astonished and somewhat confused, but politely chatted to him for a while, until he stumbled back to his embarrassed, blushing wife. That definitely added an element of surprise to my night.  When we got our mains, we were both so impressed with the food. My boyfriend had the pulled pork sandwich, and he couldn't stop raving about it. I had the cheeseburger, which I ate as if it was the last meal I'd ever have! I would definitely return to this fab joint!"}
{"text":"This place has great decor and very nice staff. The meals are so delicious but you don't get a lot for the price, I find. But, what can you do for bar food. The shrimp Malaysian curry is excellent! Ask for chopsticks and hot sauce to complete the experience"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place on the corner of Front and Jarvis. Nice patio. Tried out the lunch today. The menu is interesting, with burgers sandwich salad and taco. Had the grilled calamari salad with citrus and soy dressing. Very delicious. The calamari was done just right. Will definitely go back to try other things.  Next table had burgers and fries that came with dijon aioli. The fries look good and the aioli sounds interesting."}
