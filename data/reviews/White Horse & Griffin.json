{"text":"Very atmospheric coaching inn in the centre of Whitby. Food is erratic in quality: can be very good or very average. Best stick to the tried and trusted favourites such as fish pie and fish and chips."}
{"text":"We ended up having lunch here by accident really - you know how it is when you're all starving, one of you wants fish and chips, the other wants a burger, then add a vegetarian into the mix and you have one of those standing in the middle of the road not knowing if you're ever going survive this enforced famine!


 The out of the corner of my eye we spotted the white horse and griffen - glanced at the menu and decided to give it a go!


 The food here is not cheap, it must've been the somewhere near payday as none of as seemed to mind (either that or the hunger had made us all delirious).


 Once seated we were offered a bread roll, I had an olive one, and oh wow, it was delicious.


 They serve traditional fish and chips, alongside steaks and various specials!


 I decided to try the cassoulet - a dish I had never even heard of, let alone tried, but there was sausage and duck mentioned so I was sold!


 It wasn't speedy food, we seemed to be waiting a while for our food, but were enjoying a cheeky glass of red wine so we didn't seem to mind!


 The lunch was served in a pan! a very pretty 'copper' pan complete with handle! I was impressed, even more so when I tasted it - totally divine. One of the nicest meals I've ever had the pleasure to try!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has all the ingredients for a great meal out  except a chef! 

The location is great, the cosy, old-world feel is relaxing and, because it was only 6pm, the one waitress had plenty of time to be friendly and attentive to all six diners.

However, back to the food: I played safe and went for the cod in beer batter, chips and mushy peas. How could any chef worth his salt cock up such a traditional seaside staple as this? Well, I don't know, but he did. The mushy peas were grey and tasteless. The chips were big and trendy and unappetising. The fish, however, was the worst of everything and could only be made palatable by being smothered in ketchup. 

If this were my restaurant I would get rid of the chef and send out for takeaways from one of the myriad (and far superior) outlets in Whitby.

They serve Timmy Taylor's Landlord, which is always good news for me, or was always good news until I tasted it here. Yes, they even managed to ruin that! The beer here is served lukewarm."}
{"text":"A pub, restaurant and hotel. I've dined here and stayed overnight.


 This is a well located hotel and restaurant, serving a good breakfast.


 Room wise, the one I've stayed in had an insanely large and well appointed bathroom. The bed however was not too comfortable and was probably in need of replacement."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a cozy warm bite. The food is terrible. I had steak and ale pie. It was a bunch of cut up pieces of meat that it tasted old. There was no gravy either. They brought out 2 of the 5 of our meals out about 15 minutes before the others. 

Maybe they were having a bad day. We will never come back."}
{"text":"LOVED IT SO MUCH ASKED THEM TO CATER OUR WEDDING!!!

We were in town visiting the town of Whitby. I was told to try out the White Horse + Griffin for a drink. I was surprised by it's size of the bar + overjoyed by the quaint restaurant down below (few steps down). The charm was so inviting I made dinner reservations there that evening. We enjoyed the wine selection as well! 

I brought my mother, my fianc√©, + my future aunt... I was surprised how fantastic the cuisine was. To quickly stereotype myself: I am an American who works in the culinary world- so I can tend to be snobby about my food. I was wowed by the experience + quickly contacted them for catering our wedding. Ed was our main contact. He spent a lot of time skyping with us + making plans. He worked with our budget + to be honest wowed all our guests. I would recommend them in a heartbeat! I wish we could host another event there! We had our rehearsal dinner at the restaurant... upstairs private dining area. It was perfect. The next day had our wedding breakfast at a centre across the way. There offsite catering was spot on! 

Best WEDDING menu + food ever offered. This was a unanimous consensus from all of our guests."}
