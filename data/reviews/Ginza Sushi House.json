{"text":"Good Sushi, great service and attentiveness to guests! I would definitely come back & recommend anyone looking for good sushi."}
{"text":"BEST sushi in the area, great price. I am Asian and eating sushi is my normal diet.   Tried Sushi Rock, Pacific East, and other sushi places around.   This is the ONLY place that made REAL authenticated sushi with reasonable price.   They have FREE parking on the back too, I mean FREE parking in downtown Cleveland, can't beat that.   However, space is very limited.  Dining room decoration is OK, service is OK.   Sometimes they are busy and shorthanded, so be expected to wait a little longer. Liked: Food, Service, Atmosphere, Value, Sushi, Fish"}
{"text":"This place was bad. Service took forever along with food coming out after an hour. The sushi was mushy and poorly put together. Hibachi was small and the sauce was steak grease and I asked for another sauce and it was some minty cum looking sauce."}
{"text":"This is is just around the corner from Progressive Field.  Open during the day and sometimes at night. I say the atmosphere is closer to traditional Japanese and any of the other restaurants in downtown. They usually play Jpop music. Highly decorated and good place to checkout. Sushi was pretty good, but prices tend to be higher. They have photos of past celebrities hanging on the walls."}
{"text":"Eek. Went there about a year ago for lunch and it was pretty decent. Not amazing like Ginko, but ok-especially for the price!  Went back again a few days ago. Terrible. Food was awful. Sushi was NOT fresh at a all, extremely fishy and tastes awful. 3 rolls was $12.50 for the lunch special served with miso. I gave it two stars because of the service (good service, in and out, nice friendly server) and the miso was good. Sushi. Awful."}
{"text":"I picked Ginza since it was across from my hotel and a rainy evening in Cleveland. I was hoping to find great little place like the last time I was in NY City China Town. Not so lucky in Cleveland. The place had a nice atmosphere, service was good, staff was very friendly but the food was not impressive. I've had a spider roll, loosely wrapped, and a little bland in flavor. Convenient to the ballpark and the Q, otherwise not worth the trip."}
{"text":"After reading reviews I was inclined to try this place and was pretty disappointed. The staff was very attentive maybe a little too attentive. At the same time they were not very knowledgeable about the menu. I had to order my sashimi twice because they were out of the first two I asked for I finally gave up and had the chef decide. The  \"roll\" that I ordered was falling apart on the plate and I could hardly get it to my mouth to eat. Other than that the miso soup and seaweed salad were good."}
{"text":"i eat here a lot. i usually do takeout once a week, and weekend dining once a month. i think this is by far the best in cleveland. i have eaten at at least ten other ones in the downtown area and the food here is the most consistent in quality. i don't have a problem with pricing, i pay a lot more throughout most of the U.S. for the same amount of food. the sauces are very good from salad dressing to soy. spicy tuna roll is really good, and my friends get  the hibachi chicken etc and  are quite happy with it. decor is very nice, if you have 6 or more you can sit in the low table section on pillows. sushi bar is also nice. parking is usually on the street in front. if there is an indians game it sucks trying to find a spot. they do have four spots reserved down an alley directly behind the restaurant that is marked with a sign and orange cones. tell the owner if you park there so he doesn't have you towed..."}
{"text":"Despite some poor reviews, I decided to give this place a chance.  I was at a nearby hotel and figured it was worth a shot compared to the horrid hotel restaurant I tried the night before.  Service: 5 stars Great service.  Friendly and attentive.  Sushi: 4 stars I only had two pieces of Maguro but they were large slices and fresh.  Have I had better sushi...yes but I have traveled all over Japan in addition to all over the United States.  Hibachi Steak: 4 stars The steak was very good and the vegetables crisp and fresh.  I found the restaurant to be very clean and the prices were average to below average.  Overall a very good experience.  The location does not seem to be a very good one but hopefully they will get plenty of business from the local hotels."}
{"text":"Seriously the best sushi I have had around here in forever ! I had the spider roll, scallop roll, spicy tuna, Alaska, and some dragon roll. Everything was amazing and I devoured it all. Very fresh and great flavor. I used to work at a sushi restaurant and have been to many around Cleveland. This place is a hidden gem. I wish I had been here sooner. Don't miss out on this one ! Service was great also !"}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriend during their dinner hours before a Cav's game for a quick bite. I could've stayed hours enjoying everything on the menu and drinking warm saki. Our waitress was super nice and made us feel very welcome with a warm towel for our hands before we ordered. The food was delicious and very inexpensive. Though we were only there for 20 minutes, I'll be sure to stop in next time I'm in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and low quality.  Would have been disappointed if I paid $4 per roll and they were $10.  Service was good and miso soup was good.  Hot tea was good too."}
{"text":"I had a major craving for sashimi today, so I found myself at Ginza which is about 2 minutes away from CSU.    I ordered the sashimi special for lunch which includes 12 pieces of sashimi (3 pieces each of 4 kinds).  It also comes with rice (your choice of sushi rice or steamed rice) and miso soup all for $12.95.  The sashimi was cut a bit on the thin side, but I wasn't expecting a huge amount of food considering the low price.  The fish itself was quite fresh and had good flavor.  While I was waiting for my order, I perused the regular menu and the prices look a bit on the steeper side, even for sushi.  I can't attest to the quality or quantity that come along with dinner, however, because I haven't been there during dinner hours.    Another thing I noticed while in the restaurant is that they offer happy hour Monday through Saturday from 5-7.  During happy hour, all food and beverages are 15% off.  Not a bad deal.  Since I ordered my lunch for take out, I didn't get a good look at the entire restaurant, but from what I was able to see, it looked really nice.  A previous reviewer noted they they played JPOP...today they were playing Christmas music.  All in all, my experience with Ginza was good.  Wait time was fairly low for a take-out order, the food was good, the portion size was fair, and the price was fair.  I recommend Ginza as a good place to get lunch in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"Definitely some of the best I have had in Cleveland!  Let's be honest, Cleveland is not the sushi capital of the world, but I would take Ginza's authentic, tasty sushi over Parallax's fushion-y, overpriced mediocre sushi any day.    The prices at Ginza are reasonable, and their menu covers the gamut of all your basic sushi/ sashimi/ chiashi/ etc. to all the other basic Japanese dishes you'd expect.  They also have tatami mat seating too, if youre so inclined.  I've been here for lunch with large groups (get the sushi boat!) and for dinner .  They don't have a full bar, but they do have wine and sake!  It makes me sad that this place isn't so well known . . . perhaps because it is a little off the beaten path.  Definitely head here for decent Japanese food!"}
{"text":"I really adore Ginza. When you first walk in, you are greeted by an area with traditional Japanese mats and short tables. Under the table is a depressed area, so for us who are unaccustomed to eating with our legs crossed, you can sit normally and just pretend.   I really enjoyed their octopus salad the few times I've been here. It's very crunchy and has got a really nice flavor - zesty and sweet. Their sushi is also very very fresh. I especially like the handrolls. They're very open to ordering off menu - if you want a particular combination for your handroll, just let your waitress know and they'll arrive looking delicious right in front of you.   For those who are looking to save a little money, coming during their happy hour can save you 15% off your bill. Good foor and great savings, what's not to like?"}
{"text":"Sushi, can you go wrong? With this place its possible. The food was sub-par, not super fresh like i would have hoped for. I mean im eating raw fish but still i want it fresh! Your order is made right infront of you, which is good to know, but the quality of sushi is definetly in the pitts.  Pricing was good, not too high for sushi, but a little overpriced for quality (yes again quality). Service was fast, a bit pushy when it came to getting the check but im assuming it was because they were super busy and trying to get in as many customers as possible.  The seaweed wraps were DEFINETLY old, kind of like grocery store quality but i forgave it. You seem to get a lot of rice with your meal , egg rolls came out cold and soggy. I was a bit disappointed because ive seen all good reviews, but maybe i just came on a super busy bad day? Ill give it another try but its not the rant and rave its made out to be."}
{"text":"World's Okay-est Sushi. Ginza was located across from the hotel I stayed in for a business trip. Placing an order was easy and staff is friendly. Approachable price point. The Gyoza dumplings were delicious, but the sushi itself was mushy, a little loosely rolled, and a tad bland. Tasted just a step away from fresh. A decent place if you're in a pinch, but if you're a sushi connoisseur, you'll remain unimpressed."}
{"text":"Great food and the sake was fantastic. Spicy Tuna wasn't quite as good as other places I've been but the fish was fresh. My server was a little too attentive and very talkative. I would go back for seconds here."}
{"text":"Shrimp tempura roll was grossly underwhelming for the price - small, no veggies in there, not fresh. Boo!  Two stars are for the nice older woman who talked to me about life as I waited for my order."}
{"text":"Meh. We went here because it was across from our hotel and it was late and snowing and I love hibachi and well... dammit.  I wish it was good. but it was lackluster.  the sushi was loose and the hibachi was not hot enough to get a sear and the sauce for the gyoza was vinegar, vinegar, vinegar. Seriously, I tried a little of the everything. The salad dressing was better than average, and the miso soup was a good soup."}
{"text":"Ive gone three times in one week if that gives you any idea of how this review is going to go...  Ginza is my go-to sushi spot downtown. Good priced lunch specials (3 rolls +soup) for $11.95, excellent avocado & shrimp w/mayo dressing salad appetizer, and swift service. their spicy tuna rolls are my favorite in cleveland! also, the hot towel pre-meal is a nice bonus.  Not much i can say besides that I would recommend it above any other downtown spot. the best priced, fastest and best tasting sushi for all of us that work downtown and only have an hour for lunch.  Happy Hour (starts at 6 mon-thurs, 5:30 fri & sat) is 15% off of food and drinks.   Oh- and if you plan on sitting in one of the cozy underground floor tables.... plan on taking your shoes off!"}
{"text":"I want to give this place more stars, but the hibachi is kind of average. 3.5 rounded up to 4. But it's a family run place with good service (the little girl trying to amuse herself was a sweetheart) so that counts for something. Also, the kitchen stays open fairly late, even when the weather is kind of crappy. So when you look out your hotel window and the open light shines like a beacon, walk across the street, pick the chicken over the steak and don't miss the shrimp. (I didn't try the sushi, sorry y'all.)"}
{"text":"Bonus with our last visit:   - Our 8yr old dining guest was extremely pleased with his rolls. It's not super easy to please kids!   - Their little girl was running around, flirting with customers. Don't worry--it was the cutest thing ever and the place was pretty slow. No one seemed to mind.   - The gave us so.much.pickled ginger. I was the happiest girl alive!   Reliable, decent place to pig out on sushi without blowing your pay check."}
{"text":"The family that runs this place are awesome. They're very welcoming and kind. Now only that but this place is peaceful, beautiful inside and have good music that gives you good vibes. To top of the customer service m, the food and awesome. I love sashimi here and the steak yakisoba!"}
{"text":"This review is for the sushi alone, as I have yet to try the hibachi. I absolutely love this place. The servers and hosts are always so friendly and very attentive. I'm always greeted with a smile. The atmosphere is intimate without being small - and with the hot towel served to you before your meal it's a nice way to relax after the work day. I can honestly say I haven't had a piece of sushi or sashimi that I have disliked. I adore the creamy scallop roll! The seaweed salad is also something I find myself craving. This is a place that I will continue to return to whenever I'm craving sushi. You can't beat the half price sushi on Wednesday nights!"}
{"text":"I travel for a living so I eat out almost 5 nights a week and ha email been doing so now for 18 years.  This place was across from the Hilton so I gave it a try and I am glad I did.  Family owed business, clean and friendly.  Did I mention their sushi and hibachi were spot on?  I was very impressed all around."}
{"text":"Just visiting Cleveland, and I wondered how good fish would be here, and this place exceeded my expectations. Chef behind the sushi bar is super friendly too, which makes it nice."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by Sushi Rock - if you want to pay a lot for sushi that is ~actually~ good and not the decor (though it is nice here, too) come to Ginza! I suggest getting the \"Love Boat\" - a beautiful array of expertly made sushi placed like hard working sailors on a mini boat docked right onto your dinner table. The atmosphere is nice and quiet and the service is perfection."}
{"text":"I've had sushi at only two places in Cleveland, but this is by far the lesser of the two.  Of all the sushi restaurants I've been to around the world, this one is clearly the worst.  The sushi was not fresh, nor was the rice.  After reading the reviews here, I was sorely disappointed.  The service however was quite good.  I've been in too many restaurants where it was largely empty, and the service suffered.  That was not the case here.  Kudos to the wait staff for being on the ball.  Back to the bad side, cleanliness is something they're only slightly familiar with.  As I was walking out, I noted my shoes sticking to the floor.  There were other sections of the carpet where a similar stickiness was found.  On a similar note, the toothpicks at the door were in a cup, not wrapped, exposed to the fingers of all who dared to take one.  Overall, this place isn't worth the time.  Take a few more minutes and go to Sushi Rock.  It's a bit more trendy, and costs more, but the sushi is much better.  And another thing...  What self respecting restaurant takes Diners' Club, but not AMEX?  M/C, Visa, Discover, D/C, but not AMEX.  Meal times are too short to waste them on bad sushi.  This is bad sushi."}
{"text":"While it's certainly not the best place in Cleve, it's certainly good. Very nice service, the sushi is competitively priced, and it's quiet. A large plate of veggie sushi, with soup and salad, ran about $13, with an extra $2 for a pot of hot tea. The menu was quite varied, and the rest of my party seemed very happy with their sashimi and seaweed salads. So the main point being: good but not great."}
{"text":"Very good little sushi joint. Was staying at the Hilton across the street and was very convenient and was open late. I was quite impressed with the taste."}
{"text":"looking for a good meal for a great price...try this place. It took them a few mins to get started with cooking the food but it was worth the wait. The hibachi grill is not at your table like Benihana so don't expect that experience.  Likes - Prices (beer and food) - House salad - Hibachi Chicken and shrimp combo with fried rice - portion sizes"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Northeast Ohio. I gave it four out of five stars because it's pretty expensive. I would recommend going there for one of the sushi lunch specials instead of ordering from the dinner menu."}
{"text":"We have been frequenting Ginza since I was a child. It's always been very good, and you get a lot for your money. Also, next time you're there and feel like having a drink, try the Fuki Plum Wine. It's so amazing that we just bought the entire bottle."}
{"text":"Last weekend was CLAW (Cleveland Leather Annual Weekend) and a lot of the dudes stayed at the hotel across the street. My table was the only place in house without a single leather jacket or hat. The server seemed to get flustered easily. I don't think he really knew what was going on. The old lady in there is cute as pie and was pretty damn funny. The sushi was good. If you live downtown or on the near west side, Ginza is a good sushi option."}
{"text":"Very good.. great if you are staying at the Hilton Garden Inn as it is across the street."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner on 4/22/2014 and was very underwhelmed. The service was quite slow and not very personable, in fact my server did not say much at all. The ambience was annoying as there was cheesy bubble gum Japanese pop playing over speakers. It seemed very out of place. The food was ok, kinda ho-hum. I got the Hibachi shrimp and steak with fried rice which was kind of bland. The fried rice was oily and didn't have any egg or veggies in it like typical Hibachi fried rice and came about 5 minutes after my food. Would I go back even if I was staying the hotel across the street (which I am)? No."}
{"text":"In town for biz and needed food late night upon arrival.   Hilton Garden said \"pretty good\" and provided a menu for ordering.  On track in a positive way so far.    I called in for Churashi (sp?) sushi special and a house salad.   Ready in 15 minutes -- nice.   When i walked in the order to pick up / very odd musty smell in the place.   Glad I was getting to go.   OK so salad was days old lettuce at best - pretty sure i got the dregs and they threw out the rest.   Sushi was decent and flavorful, but a bit odd in that it was pieces dropped over a single mountain of rice as opposed to individual/traditional fish+rice pieces.   All in all satisfying and I would try again if in the area.  Just would not necessarily go out of my way to go here again."}
{"text":"They have ok sushi. It doesn't stand out among the sushi I've had in Cleveland.   The decor did stand out though.  The service was great; I felt like they paid me extra attention, but maybe because it was not very crowded at the time."}
