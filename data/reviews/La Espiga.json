{"text":"The horchata was literally a liquid churro.  About the best thing I have ever tasted.  I wanted to swim in it.  We got enchiladas verde an empanada and three tamales.   Thank goodness Taryn speaks Spanish because this is one of those places that can be tough if you do not but you should give it a try even if you do not!  I thought the food was very high quality, the enchiladas had great flavor, the sauce was nice and the cheese was authentic.  The tamales were the star of the show, really tasty and some of the best i have had.  Give this place a try if you are a Mexican fiend like me, its worth it!"}
{"text":"How do you say \"yum\" in Spanish? On our first visit we sampled tamales (rajas, verdes, and oaxaqueños), enchiladas verdes, and the mole verde empanada. Everything was delicious!   The tamal oaxaqueño -- wrapped in plantain leaves -- was my favorite! The enchiladas came with sides of the best rice and beans I've ever tasted. The empanada was filled with chicken and mole verde. I am a lover of all things mole (although I'd never seen a green mole before) so this did not disappoint.   Oh! And the aguas frescas. What ever you do, don't skip the aguas frescas. The first question I always ask at Mexican restaurants is, \"Tienes aguas frescas?\" and my eyes light up when the answer is yes. On this particular visit, my eyes lit up as she told me they had horchata (milk and cinnamon) and jamaica (hibiscus). I ordered the jamaica and Ted had the horchata. Both were served in GIANT styrofoam cups. I've been sipping mine for 2-days now and still have 1/4 of the cup left. The jamaica is herbal and sweet, very refreshing. The horchata tasted like a cinnamon churro in a glass.   The kind woman that took out order put up with my terrible Spanish and took the opportunity to practice her English with us. Moral of that story is, don't let a language barrier scare you away from visiting La Espiga.   They had a display with all sorts of Mexican sweets and treats (dried mango slices with chile!!) and a bakery case that was pretty empty by the time we meandered in at 8pm. We'll be back to sample their pastries one morning. And, I have no doubt there are lots of La Espiga tamales in our future!"}
