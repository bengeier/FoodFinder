{"text":"Visited this place per a friend's recommendation.  Sometimes all it takes is to do things right without fancy gimmicks. I had the Bacon cheese burger. The bacon is crispy. The bun is soft and toasted, meat is juicy, the lettuces and tomato are fresh.  The gravy for the poutine taste like real gravy instead of those powder severed in the chain smokes' poutineries.  Another thing good about it is you don't have a greasy breath like five guys and McDonald. It might not be as stand out as priest burgers but it is also less likely to give you an greasy heart attack.  Anyhow. I would recommend give it a try."}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out for breakfast. I had a Poutine from them shortly after the first opened, it wasn't anything special. I got beef and chicken on it and while the gravy, fries, and cheese curds were good, the beef and chicken tasted like they had been previously frozen. The beef was almost like a processed meat rather than a piece of steak. If I were to get another Poutine from them, it would be straight up, no toppings. The potion size was very generous though and I couldn't eat the whole thing.   Breakfast was good. When I got to work I could smell bacon, and I assumed they were the ones cooking it as there aren't many other places in the area who serve breakfast. Since I have an offsite meeting today around lunch, I decided to check them out because I will be eating lunch late. (Normally I don't eat a big breakfast yeah yeah, I know, most important meal of the day...)  The sandwich was good. I wouldn't say it was amazing but I would eat it again. The price is comparable to a Timmy's breakfast sandwich and the quality was much better, so at least I know I can skip the drive-thru!  The hash brown was yummy, nice and crispy, a little too greasy but I assume they deep fried it as it had that flavour. However, I am partial to potatoes so they would really have to mess it up for me not to enjoy it.   I haven't had their burgers but a coworker did and was disappointed, apparently it was a little to charbroiled.   So, three stars because they're good but the food isn't so amazing that I'm dying to go back. And I literally work right across the street from them, so that's probably a good thing...for my health anyway!  If you like burgers and poutine that don't break the bank though, definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"Great hamburgers. Very well made and seasoned well.   Their specialty poutines are massive and only $1 or so more than smokes.   Hidden away from the major roads but worth stopping in to try. Busy on lunch."}
{"text":"I had the eggs and peameal. Was ok. What can you do wrong with eggs. Was there at 10:45 and he charged me for the after 11:00 price. Don't think that was right.   Didn't like the food on plastic plates and plastic cutlery."}
{"text":"Had a hankering for poutine today and found this place on Yelp. My BF and I happen to be driving on the highway from Toronto towards Vaughmills and figured we'd give this place a try since it was only a 4 minute drive to Vaughmills.  My BF and I shared a BBQ Pork sandwich and we felt it tasted pretty good, I would say pretty comparable to Banh Mi Boys sandwiches.  The poutine was amazing! As others had mentioned, it's a little bit more expensive than your average smokes poutine but definitely better value because of that real beef gravy taste.  If I happen to be back up in the area, I will definitely visit again. And I would recommend it to friends and family members or anyone craving a good priced burger and fries or poutine.  Thanks =)"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday because we were looking for authentic poutine. They had a ton of different types of poutine to choose from which made my decision that much harder.  I went with the \"Pork Up\" and it hit the spot.  My only criticism would be that they are heavy handed with the gravy, however this would not stop me from going back when I am in the area again."}
{"text":"Love the burgers and sweet potato fires also the omelette for breakfast great service and fresh food just hidden place but I'm glad I found it because it's beside my work"}
