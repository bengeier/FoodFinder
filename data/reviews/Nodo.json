{"text":"Great addition to the junction! I love simple, fresh, authentic Italian food and that's exactly what nodo does! Great space, nice decor, good variety on the menu and great wine list! Will define my become a staple!"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday with family (the bottom private room was reserved for us), it was amazing. I ordered the bass with vegetables and my husband had the beef short ribs. The portions were more than generous and the taste of the food was perfect. Not over seasoned, just the right amount of salt. My in laws had pasta dishes and they were very happy with their dishes as well. I will definitely be coming back. It was a bit loud, but they allowed us to close the door downstairs - it made for a nice quiet evening, good company, great food! come to the Junction and try out this restaurant! Loved it!"}
{"text":"*Great* food, but the service was quite negligent. We ended up walking to the service counter to get our own pepper and parmigiana, and 20 mins for a beer. They need to be more attentive to the guests near the front."}
{"text":"Just FYI - They do not take reservations. Some people recommended that in their reviews but it just can't happen. I'll be back if I get a table :)  The 5 stars is because they were nice on the phone and you can't post without stars."}
{"text":"I had no expectations for Nodo but walked away very satisfied after a Saturday evening dinner there.  We started off with the Fritto Misto Gamberi E Calamari, mainly a fried calamari dish along with 3 pieces of decent mid-sized shrimp. It was deliciously battered and fried, served hot and fresh with a lemon and a small cup of 'Quattro Stagioni' sauce. I found that the calamari itself was flavourful enough to enjoy even without the sauce.  The Pappardelle Ragu D'anatra was perfectly al dente pasta, rich in flavours, and the duck ragu was delicious. I would've enjoyed it even more if it had a touch of heat (i.e. chili flakes).  The Garganelli Cavolfiore Gratinato was really good as well if you like creamy pastas. The breadcrumb-cheese-crusted cauliflower was a nice touch, I would've liked more of it in the dish. A little on the rich side but the portion was generous enough that I could pack up a little leftovers and save room for dessert.  We finished with the tiramisu which was soft, delicious, and creamy. It was the perfect end to a great meal.  The ambiance and atmosphere was nice, and the server was attentive without being overbearing.  Overall, Nodo is definitely a gem for italian food in the city. I would visit again at this location or their new one that recently opened up."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Came here for an anniversary dinner after my boyfriend had visited previously for a work lunch. I was so impressed with the atmosphere and the food. We ordered the Milanese pizza, calamari and lamb. I would recommend this place to anyone and will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The place has a nice vibe and the staff were friendly.  The food we ordered was not very good. The Tuna nicoise-style salad ($16) had a lovely presentation but lacked flavour.  The Margherita-style pizza ($12) and excessively salty with the salt overwhelming the tomato flavour.  There were only 3 small basil leaves clumped together on the large surface.  For some reason the waiter recommended this pizza over the gnocchi.  I really wish I had selected the gnocchi or anything else for that matter.  The name of the appetizer we ordered escapes my mind.  It was these pillowy dough things filled with a cream like cheese.  It was probably the best choice of the night  although the prosciutto had a weird taste like it was imbibed with other foods from the refrigerator.  Questions I should have  asked: - why did you leave us a small dish of very salty beans on the table with an accompanying small empty dish?  Even if we eat the small salty beans there is nothing to discard. - why tell me this horrible cheap pizza was good?  It doesn't compare to a good Margherita.  Just tell me what is actually good.  I want to eat the good thing. -why is there no pepper? on the table or freshly ground by the waiter.  I would take either. - Is there supposed to be a complementary bread basket?  It looked like most tables had a basket of bread except for ours."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this casual and very hip Italian style restaurant. My 80 year old parents live 15 minutes from the place and we all enjoyed it. One note for the owners though. The menu type was pretty small so we all had to put on glasses in order to read it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, wonderful service, and on top of that, our pasta dishes and desserts were delicious. Nodo is now my go to Italian restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"For a lunch experience I think it was pretty average. Food is well priced though. I Jane had better pizza in the T.O. and the beer selection was poor. I would like to go back with my wife to see what they may hide for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Went here for my mother's birthday, they do not take reservations, I hate when places are \"above\" taking reservations but anyway, we still went.  Had the arancini which was really delicious, has a ragu sauce with some peas in it as well, never seen it done that way before. Also had the warm olives and bread knots, the olives were great, the bread was dry.  Wine list is decent, I like how they group by price because come on, we don't all work on Bay Street. Selected a nice Barbaresco from 2010 but they brought out the 2011, no biggie.  We enjoyed three pasta dishes as entres:   Pappardelle Ragu D' Anatra it was insanely rich and tasty, the duck is excellent. A couple pieces of the pappardelle was stuck together and raw but the majority of pieces were cooked as pasta should be, slightly a la dente.  Tagliatelle Straccetti di Manzo e Funghi, quite delicious my mom polished off the whole bowl.  Spaghetti Aglio Olio Adriatico, again an excellent dish with perfectly cooked pasta, what they don't tell you is they use sea asparagus which is quite rare and delicious if you like them, the seafood was also very fresh and cooked as you would want it (i.e. not mush!)  They also have cacio pepe which is a Rome specialty (even though this place is apparently Sicilian?) and as simple as it sounds it's very tough to get right, we didn't have it but I want to try it at some point.  The most disappointing aspect of the night was when I told the manager that it was my mother's birthday and if he could bring over a tiramisu with a candle. He said of course no problem. I waited about 15 minutes and no Tiramisu and no candle, I wish I was able to tell the server but as you're trying to \"sneakily\" tell someone without my mother noticing it's kind of tough. The manager guy basically spent the entire night talking to a table of gentlemen who were speaking Italian. I guess I know where I fell in the pecking order of importance. I ended up leaving without being able to sing happy birthday to my mom, a little disappointing. Our server was great and no fault of hers.  Would I go back....probably, would I ever go for a special night again? Nope."}
{"text":"Well to start off I haven't really heard much about nodo before coming here. One of my buddies works as the bartender which is where I heard about how good it is (he's an awesome bartender by the way). So I went with my family, the atmosphere of the restaurant was enjoyed by all. They start off by bringing your table some beans that are a definite must try.  We then ordered the rice balls which let me tell you.... They are wonderful. Cheese is perfectly melted with a crisp outer covering.  They then bring you a complimentary bread with an olive oil to dip.  We then ordered a bottle of wine and some other drinks, which were all super great!  So now that we were pretty dam full to move on the the main meals. I ordered the fettuccine, which had mushrooms! My favorite thing by the way and some awesome sauce! Would highly recommend! But f*ck I wish I got the gnocci My sister had the pizza with mushrooms, olives and artichokes, she subbed the procutto for sausage and it was quite tasty.  So with all that says it was defiantly a challenge to resist desert so we went for it.  Have you ever had canelloni? Well If not this is your calling. Crisp pastry with a homemade cream... One end pastaccio, one end chocolate we got the whole platter so taramasu and chocolate cake all which were mouth watering.  Our waitress was spectacular and highly educated! But big shout out to that bartender  Needless to say... Make sure to starve yourself before going and make sure to expand your stomach"}
{"text":"Risotto was amazing.  Great service and fantastic food.  Menu was a little longer than I like to see - but that's ok. It was a solid offering that covered something for everyone.  A little louder than what I was looking for - but a couple glasses of wine solved that problem.  Well done - worth a second and third visit!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple months ago when looking for something in the Junction area. It was quite busy when arrived but were able to get a table near the front windows which was a little quieter. We shared the lamb skewers and rice balls to start which everyone agreed were very good. I had the parpadelle with duck ragu for my main and found it to be a bit salty but good nonetheless. Friends had the seafood pasta and risotto which they were also happy with. For dessert, the gelato (even though promised that it was \"real\" gelato) was more like ice cream unfortunately and the tiramisu was not the best I've had. Would come back for the apps and mains but skip the desert."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant in the Junction!   4 of us walked in and were immediately seated on a Saturday night, which was lucky as the place soon had a line out the door. All the staff was great, and they seemed excited to be working there. Food was absolutely delicious - the pasta's made in house, and the pizza had just the right thin crust. We had the tiramisu for dessert which was perfect for sharing between two people. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Came here on Friday night at 6:30 for dinner with 4 other people.  They don't take reservations, so depending on what day and time you come you may have to wait.  We got lucky and were seated very quickly. There are several places to park on nearby streets.  This is right beside Playa Cabana Cantina, and is one of the newer restaurants in the Junction's food scene.  They've done a great job with the decor and the ambiance inside, it's slightly rustic chic and not pretentious.  The service was excellent the whole time, very friendly and great at recommending wines.  To start we had the spiducci, a charcuterie board, buffalo mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes and a margherita pizza to share.  Now when it comes to spiducci/ lamb in general, I can be iffy on it because I find unless it's a good lamb, and cooked properly, you get that unmistakable muttony flavour. This spiducci was cooked perfectly and flavourful, came right off the stick.  The charcuterie board had a couple different types of cheeses (one of which had truffle in it), prosciutto, and a few types of salami, an amazing truffle honey and a couple things on it I can't remember which was amazing.  The buffalo mozzarella was large, soft and fresh and the multi-coloured heirloom tomatoes were a nice touch.  The pizza was excellent, tasted fresh, and had a nice thin crust.  I was just in Italy for a month this summer and this pizza definitely compared.  For my main I had one of the specials of the night which was a risotto with scallops and a peice of salmon on top.  The risotto was comparable to a traditional northern italian risotto which is hearty with small pieces of vegetables added in like diced carrots, peas, and beans.  The small scallops were a nice touch and did not overpower the nicely cooked salmon filet on top.  For dessert, I had the flourless chocolate torte with vanilla gelato.  OMG is all I can say.  The chocolate torte was rich, moist, soft and warm, and combined with the ice cream was amazing.  After our meal, one of the owners of the restaurant came by to talk to us, he was a very nice person and you can tell he's passionate about his business.  Overall, was very impressed with our experience and can't wait to come back (probably very soon)."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Quaint little restaurant with lovely Italian feel. Conveniently located in between multiple good bars, with street parking, and a public lot a block away.   So happy I found this place. The food is flavoursome and relatively inexpensive. Will be having a large party here soon in their private dining room, with has real charm. Very impressive."}
{"text":"I ordered through uber eats, excited to be able to try nodo without having to leave my kitchen. Everything is amazing!!!!!!! Had the garganelli cavolfiore gratinato, which was perfectly seasoned and had an impeccable cheesy sauce. Also had the brussel sprouts, and rapini which were generous in portions and very yummy and simple, perfect Italian food! My very favourite was the cauliflower and herbed fingerlings, honestly, the best dish I could've asked for. They really do cook all the food perfectly (Brussels were not too charred but cooked through). All in all I'm overly impressed with their food quality, portions and ability to nail seasonings (not overly salty but not bland by any means)and cannot wait to try more from them. If these dishes were this good delivered, I'm sure it'll be even better at their restaurant, can't wait to take my boyfriend!"}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight. Absolutely amazing! I had the risotto with lamb. It was so delicious. The waitress we had was so friendly and patient with us(large group). I can't wait to go back! You have to try this place!"}
{"text":"Tried the new school gnocchi - amazing. Perfectly soft and pillowy inside but with a slight crisp on the outside and a perfectly savoury, creamy balanced sauce. I was smiling the whole time while eating it."}
{"text":"I 100% agree with the first reviewer - fantastic food!  The salads were excellent,  as were the pastas. And the cannoli was an absolutely delicious end to a perfect meal.  For only being open a week,  the staff really had their act together - service was excellent,  and even though we came in at the start of a rush,  everything ran smoothly.  Nice to see another great food option in the Junction!"}
{"text":"Wow phenomenal food, the best Italian I've had in a long time!  We were a group of five without reservations on a Friday night so there was a lengthy wait, but we prepared ourselves with a pitcher of margaritas at the Mexican next door. Let's see, tried the arancini, shrimp & calamari, pappardelle, rigatoni bolognese, pizza with prosciutto, short rib - all perfectly prepared and delicious.  Wish we had room for dessert.  Also ordered an expensive Nebbiolo but it was worth it.  Great atmosphere and nice service too - we'll be back next time we're in TO!"}
{"text":"Great dining experience! Highly recommend the tuna salad, carpaccio and mains. The staff was very friendly and courtius. The owner even came by iur table to give a warm greeting. Top notch!!!"}
{"text":"We were there last Saturday night. The place was packed, so we ended up having drinks at the bar for about 45 minutes before we were seated. The service at the bar was excellent. Everything we ordered was excellent. I am not surprised this place was so busy!! We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Took my fiancée here for his birthday dinner last Thursday! This place was amazing - we had the arancini balls and shared two pizzas along with some wine and everything was fantastic. The pizza was very good and comparable to libretto and some of the other hit pizza spots in the city. The décor inside was awesome and added to the experience - very beautiful and cozy.   What really stood out above all was the service - every person we encountered from the moment we walked in the door to the moment we left was warm, friendly and our server in particular was amazing. I didn't get his name (which I really wish I did) but he really was the icing on the cake to a great meal with the service he provided. I will DEFINITELY be back to this place!"}
{"text":"Decided to bring my friend here when she came to visit for the holidays. We loved it! The food was great and the service was amazing. I work in the restaurant industry so I know what good service is all about and it was perfect. Neil was our server and he was extremely helpful when we had questions, it was obvious he was knowledgable on their menu. He was also very funny and had me and my friend laughing every time he was at the table. He made it a really fun experience.  Anyway, on to the food. It was very delicious! Classic Italian food. I had the featured risotto and my friend had the rigatoni bolognese. It was pretty busy so we did wait a little longer then we would have liked, since we were quite hungry, but it was well worth the wait once we got the food. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and I definitely plan to go again!"}
{"text":"Service was very nice, and the management actually seems like it cares about its customers.  That being said, all the food was bland to bad. Pasta came with three measly pieces of dry and over cooked beef. Shrimp and Calamari was fried to the point where it tasted like rubber."}
{"text":"Delicious meals, HORRIBLE service, and an accompaniment of Flies ...  I have dined at Nodo before and was thoroughly impressed with the meals and the service! ( I was in a larger party and we were spending quite a bit of money(explains the great service ) I was so excited to take my husband to Nodo to try their dish with the octopus and potatoes. Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted and showed to our table. When our server finally decided to come over, I inquired as to the octopus salad that I had enjoyed at my previous visit. I was very promptly and quite bluntly corrected that the dish was not a salad. Her curt manner shocked my husband. I wish I could say that was the last negative interaction, but sadly it was not. Our server left and didn't come back to us until 20 mins later when my husband made his 3RD attempt to motion to her - indicating we were ready to order. We placed our orders, there was no verbal acknowledgement from her and just like that she was gone- Leaving us to sit quietly with our empty bread basket. Another server brought us out our entrees a short while later. They were delicious. Our server never checked in with us, not even once. She continued to check in with the table next to us ensuring they enjoyed their meal. After our meals were finished we had to ask a server happening by for a dessert menu. Once again, flagged down our server to order an Affogato. At which point it was made clear to me I was not cultured enough- for not having properly enunciated the \"T\" in Affogato. 20 minutes later, no Affogato. At this point I'd prefer to collect my bill and leave. Our server passes by numerous times and even stands idly by while we wait.  The coffee is ready, but so are the beverages of the table next to us that happened to order 10 minutes after we did. The server left the coffee sitting there to tend to our neighbours. When she brought the coffee I simply got a \"thanks for your patience \" as she began to turn and walk away. I requested the bill. $70 later, just when I thought our special treatment was exclusive to our table. The elderly gentleman sitting on the other side of us requested bread with his pasta, to which she curtly responded our pasta isn't eaten with bread and walked away. I can't decide if I'll return or not, but have noted the name and section of the server to avoid an unpleasant experience in the future. I really do hope NoDo reads these reviews, these are the few things that are keeping them from being truly great! - side note there were an abundance of flies around our table- 4-5 buzzing around our food at all times. We were close to the bar and food prep- not the door or windows."}
{"text":"This place is to die for delicious. I've been three times and never did it once disappoint. Usually we get a glass of wine, an appetizer or cheese board, our entrée followed by a digestif. We've had a variety of their pasta dishes and they are all beyond amazing.  I tend to be picky in terms of quality of food and know what to expect since I have culinary training. This place definitely assures quality in every dish. The pasta is always fresh. It seems that their menu compromises of pastas that are easier to make fresh. It is always cooked al-dente. The sauces are made from scratch and perfectly seasoned.   The staff is also very kind and knowledgeable. We love coming here and feel that it is very reasonably priced for the quality of the food and the whole experience. I would highly recommend NODO."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian restaurant. Always busy. Tried the basics Cesar salad, margherita pizza and rigatoni bolognese. Simple and Delicious. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"So hard to explain, but very disappointed. We waited for an hour until we received our dinner. We had the caesar salad (not too bad) to share, we ordered for entree fettuccine bolognese and the fettuccine with beef tips and mushroom. After waiting the fettuccine bolognese was awful, we sent it back because the pasta was raw, and I mean literally raw. Not al dente, because trust me I know al dente. The pasta wasn't hot, the sauce was, so when you tasted the pasta it was barely warm. My friend was grossed out he didn't even want it redone. The owner, funny enough was walking towards us and he literally walked passed us to another table and asked how their meal was, and didn't even bother to apologize or anything. Our waitress couldn't wait to get us out, she didn't even apologize for our experience or anything, she was just rushing to get us our bill so we can leave. Very disappointed. We been there 3-4 times already, but because of this experience, never going back again."}
{"text":"I had to give this place another shot and I am glad I did. This time they came through fully I had really good time food was perfect and staff is really friendly."}
{"text":"I didn't like. Honestly the best part was the bread and butter which they get from Messina bakery. Trend and expensive place. If you look for a great experience at least look for a place where they made they own pasta. Otherwise you can make at home but without a cool and fancy decoration."}
{"text":"I've visited a couple of times now. The flavours are authentic and well balanced. Pizza is decent here but I'd recommend a pasta course instead.  Service was inconsistent, but had a great experience overall."}
{"text":"This is a great place! They have everything just right - the decor, the food, the pricing, the service. I get the sense that they are genuinely interested in creating a quality experience. The pizza was surprisingly good, and the arugula salad I could eat every day! A wonderful addition to the Junction."}
{"text":"Excellent as far as Italian (fusion) is concerned! Worth the trip over from midtown! Gnocchi and appetizers we're delicious! Will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at this restaurant. This experience confirms my 4 A's. Atmosphere. Accommodating. Attentive. Amazing. What a spot this is. It's homey, loving, nostalgic and delicious. We were there tonight with a few friends and everyone had a positive experience. Our waitress (didn't get her name) was so nice and even though they were super busy, we always felt like we were being taken care of. Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Found this gem by fluke.  I'm glad we went in. Atmosphere and food was amazing. I loved the platting. I can't to go back"}
{"text":"I checked this place out after I was recommended it by a friend. Being Italian, I'm usually very critical of Italian restaurants, but I was extremely impressed by NODO. Not only was the food top tier, but the service was impeccable.   I will definitely be back here again!"}
{"text":"Nice quaint restaurant. Went for dinner there tonight with a girlfriend and for a Wednesday night, it's surprising this resto is packed. Thank goodness we had reservations. My girlfriend had the risotto and it was heavenly. I had the lasagna and it melted my mouth and you can taste the freshness.   I will definitely go back here and take my other girlfriends and my hubby. And this time around, I will be bringing a magnifying glass. The menu is printed on brown paper and very small print so it is almost impossible to read. But otherwise, I would recommend this resto."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch with 4 people and ordered a bunch of different items on the menu, the rice balls, pasta, pizza & the charcuterie board. The rice balls were amazing along with the pasta! When I go there again I will most certainly be ordering those items again.  The pizza was good but nothing out of this world and the charcuterie board was tasty but pretty bare.   Cute decor and friendly/knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"Great ambiance !  Good staff here.  Appetizers are a bit small.  Menu selection was short.  Wine selection is alright!"}
{"text":"This Italian restaurant really brought me to Italy.   The FETTUCCINE /// PASTA AL POMODORO FRESCO was delicious!   Very authentic Italian obviously freshly made pasta.  Soooo good.   The tiramisu was the best I've had in a while and they give you a large amount.   The pizza was also good."}
{"text":"One of the best modern Italian restaurants we have tried. The salami and cheese antipasto was a good surprise, where they served with truffled honey! The lamb chops were so moist and tender but not gamy at all. Desserts are good but not as good as the other dishes. Prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere was great. Only wish they take reservations, but will still go again!"}
{"text":"Attended a small Xmas function in December and felt that the Server and Bar Staff were more interested in the Soccer Match playing on their Jumbo  TV  than serving us.  NODO has already raised their prices prior to the January 1st Minimum-Wage Hike so you would expect better service. The wait for our meals was unusually long but the restaurant was busy. Server could have accommodated us with more bread and extra appetizers (not just a teeny-weeny dish of Chick Peas !).  Our group should have brought our own bottle of Wine and just paid the cork fee .  Avoid the thin-crust Pizza and order the Gnocchi .  Oh well,  next time.................NODO  is  a  NO-GO  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"What a great night out! Dining with our best friends is great enough, but going to a cool restaurant within walking distance from our house is even better! We started with the Spiducci, the warm olives and the rice balls. De-lish. The rice balls were so good I wish we'd ordered more of them. My friend had the braised beef, which was generous and delicious. Needed a bit of salt, but otherwise great. Her husband had the lamb special, which looked absolutely amazing. He loved it. My husband ordered pizza because he's boring. But it was very good. I ordered the grilled calamari special, which came late because the waitress ordered wrong, but honestly so good, I don't care. It was really our fault she forgot because we went on and on like idiots about how great it is she takes orders without writing things down. We wasted 5 minutes of her time and half her brain power with our drivel. Hannah you're the best!! You made our night almost as much as the best food we've had in ages.  We will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner after work with friends and their 18 month old son. The staff were great with our friends son and very helpful with getting him setup (highchair, finding spot for their stroller) and also pointing out that there were plenty of food options for kids. There was a lot of great looking dishes on the menu but we each picked one of the pasta dishes. They were all great (which I know because we all kept sharing our dish with everyone else because they were so good). Service was great.   We recently moved into the neighbourhood and this will become a regular spot for us. Can't recommend enough."}
{"text":"So delicious! Without a doubt, this little Italian gem of a restaurant does not disappoint! Dishes are sophisticated, creative, and flavorful and they are not overpriced.  Despite how 'common' it might be to order pizza and pasta, the combinations here are unique and awesome! I think you can't go wrong with whichever pizza or pasta you decide to go with, they all sound so good!   If you like a strong, creamy, mushroomy pizza, I highly suggest Ca'Domini. Our favorite dish of the night was the Rigatoni (vegetable version) though be aware this is REALLY salty and the pasta is very al dente but flavor is bang on. The papardelle with duck is interesting, still very good on its own but the other dishes we ordered impressed us more. If you order this, despite the size it is very heavy and you'll be drinking lots of water to compensate for the salt.  We also ordered grilled octopus and lamb skewers as appetizers. They were good but less value for it since for the price you don't get much. Complimentary bread with olive oil is served at every table.  Service is friendly but veryyy slow. We were ignored/forgotten a few times. Lots of families come here and there is a beautiful room downstairs if you need to book a room for a special event.  Highly recommend and would come back!"}
{"text":"Will return. Went at 5:45 before a movie and rest was 1/2 full. Nothing disappointed and the atmosphere was a good blend of nice bit not too nice and loud but not too loud. Pizza and pasta both great."}
{"text":"Nodo is the new hot spot in the junction, and it's always crazy busy. They don't take reservations and you can expect to wait about half an hour for a table on Friday night. It is well worth the wait, but expect to do some more waiting. This is one of those places where the superb quality of food really outweighs the negative aspects of the place. Service is lovely, but slow. I'm celiac, and was thrilled with the gluten free pasta I had. The noodles they use are made of corn and taste like polenta, it's delicious! The food will bring me back again and again. If the service was just a bit quicker it would be a 5 star review."}
{"text":"This is for the St Clair location.  Was a bit of wait to get a table, but that's understandable as they just opened. Good beer/cocktail/wine list.  3 things that could've been better....  1. We had to ask for bread, as every table around us already had some, and then the bread Came with the main course.  2. We requested our leftover pizza be packed up..after 15 minutes of waiting we finally left.  3. The music is too loud,  should be able to hear your dinner companions and enjoy a conversation.  The food was good, we had pizza, risotto and bolognese, each dish was cooked well, however the seafood risotto for $26 should have been twice the size.  Think they've only been open a couple weeks, so we'll go back and see if they've worked out the kinks."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've had several dishes here and have always been extremely pleased. Great for lunch with the family or a dinner date. Atmosphere is welcoming and non-pretencious. Servers are attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Food is good but it took 45 minutes for mains to come. IMO thats too long and unacceptable."}
{"text":"One of the best meals and experiences this year.  Great place, food and the attention is outstanding.  Rice balls, salad, pasta, pizza, calzone, fish.  And more.  The staff make you feel quite at home.   We did not have any room for dessert, this just means that we have to make another trip for sure.  Our servers name is Darren, just a gem."}
{"text":"Delicious food, accommodating service, reasonably priced.  Solid pizza and pasta.  A great place to bring kids.  Inventive appetizers and lots of nice wines by the glass."}
{"text":"I'm a little bit late on this review and unfortunately I would have to share my bad experience. Few months back while I was pregnant I went for a lunch with my husband. I order soup to start with and potatoes in the soup was not cooked at all. When I say not cooked I really mean it. It was impossible to eat. We told waitress about \"situation\" with potatoes she took soup and left with apologies. We ate our lunch and ask for the bill. She charged us for the soup. Soup that was not cooked. I wish that nobody has the same experience as me. This never ever happened in any of the restaurants I've been to. And to get charged for it- its just ridiculous. Well I guess they feel good now cuz they lost customers and their friends over 5 dollars. Good job Nodo I guess I'll just keep going to place next door :)"}
{"text":"Wanting to take my wife out with our daughter to celebrate some recent success in her career, I asked her where she wanted to go for dinner. After some consideration she recalled that our last and only time visiting Nodo had been less for pleasure and more for function (we were starving and had to be somewhere very quickly) so we didn't get to truly enjoy our experience as we rushed through dinner, and vowed we'd return.  So having a reason to celebrate AND visit Nodo again was a double win. We knew they had great mains but now we would actually have a chance to enjoy.  I tried to make reservations but sadly even with a baby, they wouldn't as they're packed most nights without taking a reservation. So we tried our best to get there on time/early to get a seat but failed. We were fortunate enough to grab a few seats on the bar (not an easy task with a baby in a car seat). While on the bar my wife was feeling a little weary from missing lunch that day, so we asked to order a few appetizers and a drink each to help tide us over. We had:  ARANCINI $9 crispy rice balls filled with mozzarella, peas,'ragù di carne'  CARCIOFINI FRITTI $10 crispy baby artichokes, lemon- caper-cucumber aioli   I missed the fact that the arancini had meat in it so unfortunately, with my wife being vegetarian that was a miss for her (my bad), but I personally loved their egg shaped rice balls that were so delicious I could have easily had a plate or two of that for dinner. The artichokes were a sleeper, something we were a little weary of ordering but wanting something 100% vegetarian it seemed like a safe bet. And it was... and then some! The portion was plentiful and tasty! Definitely an out of the box MUST ORDER for the adventurous.  We were seated shortly thereafter and having just starred at the menu for 30 minutes while waiting we wasted little time, ordering a bottle of wine to share and the following:  BRUSCHETTONE $14 fresh tomato bruschetta pizza (with light mozzarella), garlic, shallots, fresh herbs, olive oil  ** Warning: The above, while easily the best tasting bruschetta I've had in ages, it is not Bruschetta, it's a long bruschetta pizza. Way too much for one person and damn nearly too much for two people who had mains on the way. Also a must order, especially if part of a group. **  She had... RIGATONI /// TRINACRIA $17 garlic-blitzed cherry tomato and zucchini, basil, smoked mozzarella, finished with fresh arugula, shaved ricotta salata ... and she loved it, but was so full from the rest of our meal she could barely put a dent in it so took most of this home for lunch the next day.  I had... GNOCCHI (OLD SCHOOL) /// RAGÚ D'AGNELLO $19 homemade potato gnocchi, slow-lamb ragù, lemon-mint ricotta ... and I loved this as well. I've had lamb ragu on a variety of different pasta vessels and at it's lightest its a hell of a heavy meal, but on gnocchi, pastas fat, filling cousin - it becomes a delicious colon clogging, artery stopping meal. THEN add in that dollop of fresh ricotta and stir it into the sauce and it becomes so insanely rich that my blood type rapidly changed TO Ragu. I would say the flavours of this dish are amazing but the mix of heavy ricotta, heavy gnocchi and lamb meat sauce make this far too heavy for anyone to manage if they've eaten anything else that afternoon. I'd have this on rigatonni or penne next time.  All in all a great meal, I wish they took resos, but they did do their best to help us out with our baby, and I want that Lamb Ragu pasta again but without the gnocchi, otherwise a near perfect experience in my books  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night for a birthday party in the private room downstairs. Service was exceptional and the food came quickly. Ordered the burrata and tomato appetizer and the new school gnocchi and enjoyed both! My boyfriend ordered the risotto of the day and said he would definitely recommend. However after trying the old school gnocchi dish I would definitely order that if you're looking for a more traditional Italian taste, the sauce is rich and full of flavour and the gnocchi is soft."}
{"text":"Amazing place, amazing service! Went there for my friends birthday dinner. We were a group of 6 and everything we ordered was delicious. Would definitely recommend and come back!"}
{"text":"Love their gnocchi both old and new school! Everything is really good. Can't go wrong. Place is always busy."}
{"text":"Great food and ambience. Accommodated our kid with a good choice of \"kid-friendly\" menu items. Food was well executed and service was efficient. Would definitely go back there for dinner if in the area."}
{"text":"Nice place in the junction. Good service, good enough food and atmosphere. Had fresh fettuccine with tomato sauce plus side of garlic rapini."}
{"text":"Been 3 times, love it. Great pizza and pasta. Nice restaurant, reasonably priced this is my goto place for Italian food now."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's Day, unannounced to everyone you were forced to order off the Valentine's menu instead of regular and hence spend more money. Portion sizes small and over priced. Flavour okay but would not go back as we had to go eat elsewhere after"}
{"text":"**Updated 2017- while my previous review is still true, what I'm really raving about is chef Roberto Marotta who has since left Nodo & opened his own wonderful restaurant called ARDO, on King west right at Jarvis.  Roberto has high standards for every ingredient he uses in his kitchen and is the one who brought the menu to Nodo.  So if delicious authentic Sicilian food is your focus, you should give ARDO a visit as well. :)  This is just a short review to tell you that the food at Nodo is amazing. Full disclosure: my cousin is the chef. That said, my family does a whole lot of things I wouldn't  recommend -- I'm loyal but I wouldn't tell you to eat something that I didn't truly love.    By the way, don't hire my uncle to fix your boat. Kidding. I don't have a boat.   The food at Nodo is simple, because it can be. Its just so *good*.  I had the anchovies (so fresh and delightful) the octopus (gorgeous and tasty, and for some reason the zucchini it came with blew my mind). My friend had the Old School gnocchi with wild boar ragu. It was every bit as awesome as he had hoped.   Oh the cannoli! Perfection. One side crusted with pistachios, the other with chocolate with a tiny sliver of orange. Light, fresh, fantastic.  There was so much more on the menu. We skimmed the surface really. Everything looked good. I can't wait to go back.   There is a lovely room downstairs for private parties.  And they have gluten free pasta.   Open 7 days a week!  Go. Eat. So good."}
{"text":"Gnocchis are delicious. With very good flavour the service is ok but lack professionalism. Despite this I recommend st the Jonction new vibe neighbors."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming my go-to spot to whisk away visiting friends into a quieter part of town (the Junction) and pretty much guarantee their satisfaction. With handmade noodles and the sound of Italian conversation wafting through the air (oh, and the smell of delicious food, too), Nodo delivers a truly authentic Italian experience that's a true crowd-pleaser.  The decor is a charming mix between your grandmother's hundred-year-old home and your chicest friend's dining room. Seriously, whoever designed this place has an unparalleled eye for mixing styles into literal perfection.   As for the food, it's unbeatable. My friends have had the calzone and have exploded from joy in front of me. Others have had meat-based pasta dishes and have actually imploded from sheer happiness with life. A vegetarian/vegan might have trouble with really authentic Italian places in general. At least from my experience, the most exciting dishes generally feature meat or seafood. However! Do not fear. Even their simple meals I have devoured with great joy - and by joy I mean several, \"Oh my god,\" and, \"I need five more servings of this.\" I ordered their most minimalist pasta dish - I think their pomodoro? - and I adored it. I dream about it at night, and when I open my pantry to nothing but Life cereal and peanut butter.   If your time in TO is limited, I highly suggest making the trip out to the Junction for this place alone. If you live in TO, you have no excuse not to pretend to fly out to Italy and have some epic pasta."}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent atmosphere and wait staff. Some of the best and most authentic Italian food I've ever had."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and great atmosphere. No reservations so be ready to wait but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"LOVED this place.   The atmosphere was great. Were told we had an hour wait for a table, but it ended up being more like 25 minutes. There's way more seating than I would've expected, so the turnaround was quick.  The wine was fantastic; had a nice chianti. The apps were delicious as were the mains. Everyone at the table had something different and everyone was very pleased with their choices.  Can't wait to come back!  -no reservations-"}
{"text":"I went out for dinner at NODO, last night and I couldn't stop complimenting the restaurant. From the second we walked in, we warmly greeted by a gentleman who was obviously busy but still manged to accomodate the lineup at the door in a professional manner.   The service was absolutely phenomenal! And the food, well, it was incredible! We started with the arancini, my boyfriend had the new school gnocchi and I had a pizza based off our servers recommendation. Everything was served quickly and was absolutely perfect!    I have been working in the food and beverage industry and often find it hard to go out for dinner because of my biases, and knowledge of the industry. Yesterday was a great example of a perfect night!  Thank you NODO!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved eating here so many choices for food ,the wine list was incredible, the atmosphere was welcoming and cosy, the staff was pleasant and helpful ....definitely recommend it to all my friends"}
{"text":"My go to spot for italian food. Best beef carpaccio and cannolis I've ever had! New school gnocchi is another favourite. Yum!"}
{"text":"highlights were the burrata salad and the delicious nebbiolo wine! enjoyed the bolognese and the ocotopus as well. super cute interior, great takeout as well. I'll be baaaaaaaack"}
{"text":"Was in own for TIFF and my friend suggested this place for dinner.  They don't take reservations but we called ahead and they weren't too busy on a Thursday night.  We were seated right away and the owner Charlie was really nice.  He greeted us and made us feel very welcomed.  The servers were very attentive and our food was brought out in a reasonable amount of time.    I would definitely come back, this place lives up to the Italian food standard for me.    Order the rice balls those are to die for"}
{"text":"Came on a weekday evening with 2 of my friends. The restaurant seems small and the sound level is more on the loud side.   The goods: - Trinacria rigatoni - well balance of flavour. Ingredients were really fresh and pasta was cooked to al dente.  - New school gnocchi - fried gnocchi which was crispy and did not get soggy in the sauce. Nutty, creamy and overall flavourful - Tiramisu - soft and light! It was a large slice that could be shared amongst 2 people  The OK: - pizza - I forgot which one we had but I did not enjoy it  We also ordered the calamari and arachini which were good but not mind blowing-must order every time I come here good.   Decent service. Food is more on the pricey side but I feel the goods is worth it. I would come back for the pastas which I believe is a 5/5 in my book and my overall experience is 4/5"}
{"text":"Nodo No, do go to this place. It's good.  Our party of 6 dined at Nodo on a Monday night and it was a very enjoyable experience. We will be going back to try it again the next time we are in The Junction!  Nodo was a recommendation from a friend of a friend and I did little of my own review before dining so I was really going into this one blind. We were seated at the entrance of the restaurant which could have been very uncomfortable with strong winds outside, however, there was a heavy curtain preventing most of the wind from chilling us during our meal. That's a good start! Our waitress was excellent. She was very friendly and helpful (took time to explain the multitude of questions we had) and her service was prompt.   We each ordered a starter and a main and shared two desserts, all which were excellent. The tastes were distinct and bright like Italian cuisine should be, however, next time we will order fewer starters as the portions were larger than we anticipated. The menu includes all of the traditional Italian categories (Assaggina, Insalate, Antipasti, Pizza, Pasta, etc.) which was a little overwhelming to some of our party but for someone who is more-or-less familiar with that format, all of my favourites were available. The highlight for me was the crispy, fried shrimp and calamari plate. It was well-seasoned, fried perfectly, and great for sharing. All plating was simple and elegant.  The ambiance was very enjoyable. There were interesting fixtures and pieces of art which caught our eyes at various points in the night and the high ceilings created a perfect noise level for having a group conversation. I felt as though the food prices were very fair for the quality, variety and taste. We did not order wine but the list looked sizable. Next time I will request a table closer to the back of the restaurant as the vibe seemed cozier towards the kitchen.  THE GOOD Delicious food that reminds you of Nonna's cooking. Cliché but it's true. Oh, and the portions are Nonna-sized too!  THE BAD Cannot count on dining at a specific time as reservations are not taken.  THE BEAUTIFUL Tasteful, comfortable, clean interior.  It's not just the food that's yum -the restaurant is nice on the eyes as well."}
{"text":"Love this place service is always great, food is totally on point some of the best pasta in Toronto great for take out!  Amazing arancini everything on the menu is fire down to the warm olives and bread."}
{"text":"So my friend and I wanted to meet up in the junction.  We decided to come to nodo as we wanted to have Italian.  This was our first time here and it won't be my last!  The waitress was knowledgeable and attentive!  I didn't know whether I wanted this wine by the glass and asked her a few questions and she immediately came back with a small sample.  Wine here was reasonably price and was great!  We shared the arancini balls and it was amazing - crispy outside, cheesy and so flavourful!  One of the best I have ever had!  I ordered the house made gnocchi w/ beef ragu - fresh pasta!  Good hearty flavours and so homey tasting!  Before eating we had the option of fresh grated cheese and freshly ground pepper - yes please!  We were both too full for dessert so that's enough to visit again :)"}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite Italian restaurant in Toronto. It has a rustic dimmed setting and very polite staff. My boyfriend and I began with appetizers: Calamari & Octopus (cannot remember the Italian name to save my life). The calamari was very light which made eating a lot of it enjoyable and the octopus came with grilled potatoes and zucchini. Moving onto the mains, the pasta we ordered were handmade within the restaurant. Our dishes were accompanied with extravagant, unique flavours that definitely sets the tone for Nodo. The Caramel Bread Pudding was our dessert choice and wasn't overwhelming and contained just the right amount of sweet and tasty. Overall great experience, great staff and amazing food!!! Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to easily give a 5 star rating, especially in my first try, but when the food was excellent and the prices were fair and the service was great, what more can you ask for ?  Only open 2 weeks, I was impressed that I had no complaints. Didn't have to Wait long for food and the servers were friendly and knowledgeable. Maybe it helps that the owners seemed to be on site too.  Italian food at its simplest. No try hard fancy over the top fusion stuff. Just pure taste and quality. We started off with the speducci appetizer ($8) for 3 skewers - would have been nice if there were a 4th. Although heavily salted, it tasted amazing.  Pastas ranged from $13 to 15 (in fact noticed no dish was over $20). I think it was a fair price. The Capeletti (tomato with cream of parmesean Asiago baked) was like a glorified mac and cheese but it was so good. Not heavy and creamy but not dry either, came in a large ramekin which was more than enough for me.  Husband got the calzone. Huge! But great man sized portion $15. Filled with goat cheese and eggplant and roasted red peppers.  We really want to try dessert but we were stuffed.  Downstairs there's a nice private dining area with a tv.  Only complaint is due to the open walls, there were two flies that really wanted to join us for dinner. Annoying.  We are ready to come back already and look forward for more restaurants for this calibre to open up on the street !"}
{"text":"Brutal service. Bru-tal. We had to wait 30 minutes for a drink. And then each drink subsequently took 30 minutes to arrive. Our waiter - who was out to lunch - said \"sorry, the bar is slammed...\" but at the end of the night, when there were literally 4 people in the restaurant and TWO bartenders standing there twirling their hair, it still took 30 minutes for a drink or some water.   The food was okay - but who cares with such horrible service."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at Nodo. The staff were very nice and knowledgeable. I had the cacio e pepe with pear and walnuts and it was super good. The others in my party had pizzas and they looked and smelled amazing. There are a few other dishes that I have my eye on, so I will be sure to revisit!   Pasta la Vista, baby!!"}
{"text":"High quality service and excellent prices for high quality food. The try 3 wines for 19$ is a great option. Could use better beer selection, (2 great expensive options and the rest is shit) but thats about it."}
{"text":"Man, what a bummer. This place just wasn't good. My fiance and I went on a Sunday evening, which apparently was our first mistake as it felt like we were eating at a frigging Chuck-e-Cheese restaurant. The entire room was just full of children--every table but ours had at least two and while the kids were pretty well behaved, I had to spend my time feeling sorry for those poor saps who can't eat a meal without having to cut someone's pasta into tiny bites (NO DADDY, NOT LIKE THAT!!!) or pretend to care about their crappy drawing. I actually like kids a lot but if I want the atmosphere of an Ikea restaurant on a Sunday at noon, I'll drive to Scarborough (and the meatballs will be better than my meal at Nodo).   Anyway. The food was crappy which meant I also had to feel sorry for me and my bf. The main flavour profile of my gnocchi with wild boar ragu was salt. Some doughy potato balls laced with brown salt. My partner got the pasta dish with the grana padano and cauliflower and it had no taste whatsoever.   The desserts were good (panna cotta and bread pudding) and I really liked my burrata appetizer. Our waitress was friendly and the service was decent.   We left feeling damn disappointed. I don't have a lot of money but I worked a big ass extra shift this week so we decided to treat ourselves--I guess the plus side is I can enjoy my dollar PC mac and cheese knowing it's actually better than the pasta I had at Nodo."}
{"text":"Heard this joke while I was at Nodo - Why are a lot of Italian men named Tony? Because when they migrated over to the states, they wore name tags To NY.  This is a cute cozy restaurant with great food and service.  I came for dinner with a group of 6 and had a great time.  There are many great options on the menu including soup, pizza, calzone, mussels, octopus, rigatoni, and gnocchi.  Complimentary bread was brought out with olive oil after we ordered.  The food took a while to come out, but it was delicious.    Arancini $9 - These were more like rice cones, crunchy on the outside and cheesy on the inside. Pappardelle $19 - This duck ragu ribbon pasta dish was excellent.  The meat was like pulled duck, flavorful and tender.  The sauce went really well without everything.  Street parking on Dundas is free on weekdays after 6p.  I was able to find a spot across the street when I am for dinner on a Wednesday night.  There are also paid parking lots nearby.  ....| \      _  , , , - - , ,  _  ,       .../  , ` . - ' ` '             . _   \ -  ;  ;  ;  , _     ..| ,  a  -   )   ) _         . ; .

{"text":"I went for an early dinner on a weekday. The interior looks like a nice Parisian restaurant but it was cute nonetheless! The calamari is SUPERB (though on the salty side), but that was the only good dish out of everything else we ate. The bread before the appetizer was ok but the green olive oil tasted like watered down canola oil.. t'was strange. My friend and I ordered the orecchiette and pappardelle and it was salty. The portion was great and the ingredients were fresh (especially the pasta) but the orecchiette tasted like raw garlic and salt! My duck ragu was super tender and tasty but was ALSO overly seasoned. I'd have understood if it was Spanish restaurant but even then, it was too salty. Maybe the pizzas are better."}
{"text":"For a Tuesday evening the place was jam-packed. The staff was very polite and efficient, we were seated fairly quickly. The food was absolutely fantastic. I ordered the rigatoni which was cooked exactly how I like it. I polished off the plate in minutes. Best meal I've had in a while. Will definitely be going back for more."}
{"text":"What an amazing meal! From the wine selection to the pasta quality, this place hit all the bells for us. Order the arancini and seafood linguini. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"First time here. The room was quiet when we arrived but grew progressively noisier, too much so. A very good waitress was helpful on the menu, and the apps were ample. Two of us had a lovely shrimp risotto--full of shrimp--and we split a chocolate torte. Wine was reasonably priced, and decaf coffee actually tasted like coffee. This was a very good meal in a lovely room."}
{"text":"The gals and I had much to celebrate this past week and we met up at Nodo, a new Italian hotspot in Toronto's Juntion neighbourhood.  I liked the French country décor....but wasn't this an Italian restaurant?  Whatever. It was a warm and welcoming atmosphere right upon entry.  I joined my girlfriends, who were already mid-update and snacking on what I think were pickled or soured navy beans (Is it a French thing? I'll have to check), and sliced baguettes with olive oil. I loved how the table was casually dressed in a simple and elegant way.  Three out of the four of us ordered that night's special, which was a veal chop with potato \"cubes\" resting on a bed of rapini and asparagus. Tan ordered the braised beef with vegetables. All plates were a very good size, very well presented and paired well with our wine.  (And Barb's preferred mixed drinks :-)  Nodo's chop was a chop all right. And a good-looking one, too. I cut myself a piece from the generous portion and thought about the bite as I chewed. (What I call the \"Ratatouille Moment.\")  Not as crispy as my university-friend's version, but tasty. Truthfully, I  found it a little on the salty side and it was an active explosion of flavours when paired with the bitterness of rapini and strong taste of asparagus, but when I asked my two friends (who also ordered the chop) one said: \"A teensy bit salty, but very good,\" and the other replied \"I'd like to marry the chef.\"  It's funny how we all taste our food differently.  In my opinion, the birthday dessert of handmade cannoli were the star of show (Happy Birthday, Tan!), and after one bite, I don't recall EVER eating one that good. The outside was fried and crispy, and the cheese on the inside was rich, creamy, a little tangy (yum) and I probably could have had more than just one.  Ambience? Great. It was a cold and Thursday night and the place was full, warm and buzzing. Folks were still walking in when we were leaving. It wasn't too loud, it wasn't too dark and the place had great energy. Our handsome European server was attentive and the host (Giancarlo?) was happy give our favourite Event Planner a small tour of the private dining room that, although is in the restaurant's basement, was bright, warm and perfect for large dinners and small parties. By the way, the restaurant seemsnon-descript from the outside....but it's surprisingly big on the inside.   While my dinner of choice may have been salty to me this first time around, I plan to go back and try another.  What an awesome addition to Dundas West in the Junction.   I'll see you all there again soon."}
{"text":"Slightly above average Italian restaurant. The food was alright and service was nothing special. Slightly overpriced for what you get.  Went here on a Saturday night and the place was quite busy. We had a reservation, so we were fine with getting a table. I got the rice balls as an appetizer to start and then had pizza for dinner (can't recall the name, but it was a chef's special with pear, walnuts and honey on it).   Rice balls - $9 for two rice balls. They were really cheesy and not very ricey. It tasted really good, but so is everyone covered in cheese and then deep fried.   Pizza - just over $20. The pizza was pretty good. The dough was nice and fluffy and the presentation of it was great. The pizza itself is quite sweet, but that's because of all the honey. It's almost more of a desert pizza. Good for ordering in a big group and everyone having a slice of two of it.   Service - I'm not sure if they were understaffed or what, but everything took so long. From sit down to leaving, we were there for about 2 hours. And that was not because we were taking our time. I think it took about 30 minutes just to put our order in.   Overall, with the app, pizza and wine, total bill was about $50 including tax and tip. I don't think I would come back and if I was ever in the area I would opt to try out something else. But if nothing is available, this isn't a terrible choice."}
{"text":"If it was possible to give them half a star I actually would. The reason is because their service is some of the worst I've ever experienced. The brunch menu has like 8 choices, not bad but super small amount of food to choose from. My sister had to explain herself three times about how she wanted bacon in her food. They bought the food to us after a while of waiting even though we were the only other table that was filled in the place at the time. No one came over to us while we ate to see if anything was necessary to fix or even to ask if we needed anything else. This lady asked us twice if we were finished eating when we had only gotten our food ten minutes before. Two groups of 8+ came in while we were eating and we never saw our waiter again until he decided we were finished. Not only was he rude, but he crumbled up our receipt and through it on the table, when we weren't rude in anyway possible. As I said, food wasn't bad, but if you want to have some of the worst customer service ever, Nodo is the best place to go."}
{"text":"It's a charming trattoria in the Junction.  Everything was Italian including the staff.  The best new restaurant I've been to in a long time.  The food was as fresh as it comes.  A lot of items are house made. Upscale Italian food with a twist.  I had a wonderfully light risotto with shrimp (risotto changes daily) which was very delicious.  Started off with a wonderful antipasto tray with more than just the typical things incl.  warm olives.  Tried there baby artichokes.  Very good.  One of  the people I was with had a wonderful fish dish & the other had a wonderful pasta.  We all enjoyed our food & the hospitality.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went by at 11:30, thought it would be open based on hours posted on Yelp. My wife went in to ask if they were open and was told \"Yes, sit anywhere you want\". Then, when we were walking into the restaurant, another person came by and told us they weren't open, and the other guy had been joking. Who thinks its funny to joke about a restaurant being open 30 minutes early? Not me!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere at this location. The food was quite good, not a long wait for tables if you arrive at 6pm. Nice staff and service. Great dessert too"}
{"text":"One of my two favourite Italian restaurants (and one of my top 10 favourite restaurants) in Toronto! I usually frequent the Junction location.  Delicious every time. High quality food and good wines at a fair price. Friendly and attentive staff, wonderful atmosphere and ambiance. Not pretentious. I can't say enough good things about Nodo. A neighbourhood staple for my family and I.  Note: it does get busy especially if you are going for dinner especially Thurs-Sun! I know they have a private dining room downstairs. Most tables are for 2-4 people so just know that it may be harder to get seating for larger parties. The wait can be long but there is a bar in the back and also a lot of options in the neighbourhood while you wait."}
{"text":"Welcome Nodo!  Lovely, friendly, warm service and tasty food. There was a great vibe here at 10 pm on a rainy Wednesday night. I felt like I was in Europe.   The affogato with pistachio ice cream stole my heart.   Congratulations on a successful opening."}
{"text":"Overall the food and drinks were delightful. The Crispy artichokes and the modern Gnocchi were tasty and well made. My mojito was unique and balanced with the chamomile grappa. Prices were fair too!   Decor was cute with a cozy modern twist. Food runners were also courteous. Reason for the 2 stars is because the service makes me not want to return. Our cocktails arrived well after our appetizers. Our Server was not personable and very cookie cutter. He checked in with us on our Entree once then disappeared for 45 minutes passing us by countless times. Dirty dishes sat on our table for a long time and when he finally dropped off the dessert menu we already lost our appetite. Then we had to wait another 10 minutes for our check *sigh*  Dining out is supposed be enjoyable and not make you feel annoyed and ignored. I would hesitate to return."}
{"text":"For such a charming looking restaurant with high ratings, I had big hopes for Nodo. I loved the decor and set up, which I describe as a rustic boho chic. However, the food fell short of expectations and did not taste very authentic at all. I ordered the tradition gnocchi recommend by our server, it was so so. My friend had better luck with the fish. We shared the tiramisu for dessert, but that was also underwhelming and we only ate a quarter of it. The portions are fairly large if that helps."}
{"text":"I was dissappointed. The food was too salty, pasta portion seemed stingy, the gnocchi was tough - i make better gnocchi than they do.  The pizza crust was stiff.  The service was pretty lousy.   We ordered the wine taster for 19 dollars and it was pretty stingy Wouldn't return"}
{"text":"This is our second time in Toronto and our second time to Nodo. Both times were absolutely wonderful. The menu is overwhelming with good options and the wait staff is extremely nice and accommodating. As vegetarians, we found plenty to choose from and loved our picks both visits. The garlic knots and olives are such a good starter. Their salad, pizza and calzones - all wonderful! Make sure to save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"NODO Junction is a restaurant I won't be going to again. When entering I was impressed by how busy it was. Normally a busy resturant is a good sign but as the night progressed, I'm convinced it was for other reasons. The most obvious was the lack of staff on the floor who appeared to be in the weeds. After ordering from the 2 menus they gave us for a table of 8, our drinks took over 20 minutes to come to the table, and over an hour for the main course to appear. If I wasn't with family I would have walked out.  Getting to and from the table was also challenging, as servers walked to quickly across the floor inevitably bumping into you.  If you want to sit across the table from an important person in your life and have a decent conversation, this is also not a good place to go. The music was so loud I had to talk at a volume that would be considered yelling any where else. Now about the food, for a starter I had the carpaccio, the capaccio was the one thing I really did enjoy. It was beautifuly thin with a refreshing lemon zing served with lovely fried capers, and toasted pine nuts that gave the dish a pleasing texture. Unfortunately the pizza I had did not dance on my palate in the same way. The  pizza had gorgonzola, caramelized onions and a cured meat, it was bland, there was little topping and mostly dough. NODO is a NO GO!"}
{"text":"I popped into Nodo with a friend after being thwarted by an overly busy Indie Ale House.  I've always thought this place looked cute from the outside, and we managed to get a table in about 15 minutes, although in retrospect, I would have happily waited a bit longer for some more table real estate.  The FOOD: We split an order of the Pappardelle with duck ragu ($18).  It was a rather average execution with noodles that were a bit too thick and underdone.  The ragu itself was rather tasty, although we couldn't discern any of the \"seven spices\" that were advertised.  The Madunio Pizza ($18) had a nice crust but was otherwise a miss.  The burrata was more like hard mozzarella, the pickled chilis were not all that pickled or spicy, and the rapini was in desperate need of a blanching prior to cooking.    The SERVICE was fine with a very friendly woman handling it.  Pacing was poor.    The real problem was the TABLE itself.  It must have been the smallest two-top in existence, which was then wedged up against the wall and between two other tables.  We were petrified that we would knock something off the table the entire time.  Air Canada Rouge in economy class offers more dining space per patron.  it was so uncomfortable, we felt an immense amount of relief leaving the restaurant.    OVERALL, our impression of Nodo was that it was fairly average.  One can get better pasta at a similar price at Enoteca Sociale.  The food was maybe 3.5 stars, but being squeezed into an airline seat's worth of space really ruined the experience."}
{"text":"Nodo SAVED me!   Drama aside, Nodo was a breath of fresh air in the Toronto food scene. I was planning a surprise party for my friend's 30th birthday and it felt like every restaurant I called just wanted to be difficult. I was only asking for a 10 person reservation and this was either meant with restaurants i) not wanting to accommodate us at all with attitude; ii) mandating a fixed price menu that often meant each person spending $50 or more; iii) ridiculous caking fees (e.g., we'll charge you 5$/pp to let you guys eat the cake you bought yourself). While I understand restaurants can do all of this, the call to Nodo after all these issues/rules from other restaurants went like this:  Me: \"hi, can I have a reservation for 10 people at your restaurant? Can you let me know what rules you have for accommodating us?\"  Nodo: \"rules, what rules? Don't be rowdy?\"   Nodo: \"sure! We can accommodate you! We have a special room downstairs that can all be yours for no extra fee or fixed price menu! It'll be perfect for a surprise party. You're going to bring cake, sure! We'll cut it and put it on plates and charge you nothing extra because this is how awesome we are! Oh, and we'll also play onto your lie to guide the birthday girl in and surprise the crap out of her\"  Okay, the second Nodo quotation was paraphrased because they were this cool and this awesome (the first one is true)!  The food was great, the prices were reasonable, the staff were INCREDIBLE. The birthday girl had a great time and I have been meaning to give this restaurant a stellar review for months because of how accommodating they were (over literally every other 'decent' restaurant in this city). Love them!"}
{"text":"After two visits here, a review is in order.  Nodo is a very good Italian restaurant opened by three Italian friends in the Junction between Mavety and Keele on the south side of Dundas (close to Mavety).  1. In two visits I had a seafood spaghetti dish (19$) which was delicious, as well as a sausage pizza (13$) that was good with the exception of overly dry sausage. I also had a green side salad (9$) that was excellent, as well as cannoli for dessert, which was very good, but not the best I have had. The fritto misto (11$) was fried well, but lacked flavour. Perhaps a thinly sliced fried lemon would add to the taste. 2. The restaurant is quite nice. It has both a loud, fun vibe, while managing to have a softness and warmth about it that makes it great for all occasions. 3. Another nice thing here is a wine special (19$) where you can choose three smaller pours from a select list of red and white wines by the glass. The pours were sufficiently generous. 4. I sat at both the bar and in the restaurant. Nodo has the same challenge/problem that everyone who has opened a restaurant in the Junction in the past year has... The bar is somewhat of an afterthought. Rather than having at least one designated bar tender (who is highly knowledgeable about the wines, cocktails, etc) engaged with the bar and customers at the bar about wine or opinions about spirits, the bar serves as the dishwashing station where the staff (who are very nice here) are much more engaged frantically washing glasses, drying glasses, cleaning the counter, making Espressos and filling tap waters for the restaurant customers. They could have a serious bar business here. That being said, they make a good cocktail AND the seat in the restaurant is the better choice. Service in the restaurant is excellent. 5. Nodo is off to a great start, and I believe it will only get better. Service is better than a lot of places and the food is too. Be sure to make a reservation, as it does fill up fast after 6:30."}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent. Walked in on a Sunday night for dinner and had a table within 5 minutes though the restaurant was pretty busy. Started with a caesar salad which was a nice start and had the pappardelle with the duck ragu as my main. The ragu was delicious and I will definitely be returning for it."}
{"text":"ambient of the resto was cozy, delicious food, good service. Recommend."}
{"text":"Dined here recently and enjoyed it but it didn't blow me away.  The wine was reasonably priced which was nice and the atmosphere was mostly good, except for when smoke from the kitchen billowed into the restaurant and they had to open the door - which made it really cold for the people seated near the front. They really have to resolve that situation.   Service was ok. I met a couple of friends there and we all arrived at different times in the span of about 30 minutes. I sat for 20 minutes before being offered a drink (other than water). Actually, I think I had to ask for the drink in the end. Staff was friendly enough, but it felt a bit superficial.  We started with the Arancini (Crispy rice balls filled with mozzarella, peas, 'Ragu di Carne') and they were really good and nicely presented. For the second app we had Fritto Misto Gamberi e Calamari (Crispy, dry-rub shrimp & calamari fritto, 'Quattro Stagione' sauce). It was fine, but nothing overly special.   For my main, I had Tagliatelle Straccetti di Manzo e Funghi (Beef tenderloin strips, wild mushroom, spinach, pine nuts, beef stock). I thought it was quite good - fresh pasta, nice flavour - but there were several pieces of beef I had to spit out due to gristle. I also found it odd that there was a strong truffle flavour, which wasn't referred to in the description on the menu. I don't mind truffle but I can't say I love it. Probably would not have chosen this dish if I'd known.  My friend had Rigatoni Bolognese (Slow-cooked veal/pork/ beef ragù, Reggiano) and she described it as blah - not much flavour and kind of boring. My other friend had the lamb and said it was good.  I will give Nodo another try!"}
{"text":"We had a dinner here per Yelp recommendation.  We ordered a spring salad, an octopus appetizer and a pasta (I forget the exact names).  The salad was fresh but the dressing was too sour to my liking.  My BF thought the salad dressing was alright.  We both loved the octopus appetizer.  The dish was created with fitness.  The octopus was meaty yet sufficiently tender.  The pasta was cooked al dente.  Unfortunately, the pasta sauce was very salty.  I could take salty alright, but the saltiness overwhelmed my BF.  Maybe if we had ordered a pasta with Alfredo sauce, our experience would have been better.  Services was great.  The decor was European urban classy.  The lighting was too dim.  The value of main entree was outstanding.  The appetizer was pricey due to overly small portion."}
{"text":"We ordered the roasted rainbow beets with heirloom carrots and pistachio to start (it's a side, but we wanted it instead of salad or appetizers). The texture of the beets and carrots was great and the pistachio gave it a lovely flavour and crunch.  We were craving pizza and ordered the Marea and the daily special (burrata with tomatoes and arugula). The crust was ultra thin - which we loved - and the toppings were fresh. Our wait was much longer than expected because several pizza takeout orders were ahead of us in the queue. However, our waitress checked on us often and explained the delay; we enjoyed conversation and seeing the pasta dishes that were served to neighbouring tables as we waited.   We shared the cannoli; the ricotta filling was the creamiest I've eaten!   Several other items on the menu caught my attention. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far. Once with a big group on a Saturday and once with some girlfriends during the week. They don't take reservations so it's best to show up either early 6:30ish or late 9:45ish. They do however, take your name and number and give you a call when your table is ready. On Saturday we waited for about an hour after showing up at 8pm and on Wednesday we showed up at 7pm and got a table right away.   The service here is excellent!!! They are very attentive, polite, responsive and they aren't the least bit rude (even when you ask to do annoying things, like 3-way share a salad, or package up leftovers).   The food is also excellent. The calamari is to die for. The Caesar salad is really good...not all creamy like some places. The meat and cheese board is also amazing and it's a must if you go with enough people. I had the pasta with breaded cauliflower and it was so so so good. It tasted even better the next day as leftovers. For dessert we had the tiramisu and the trio of gelato (vanilla, chocolate and pistachio) all super yummy. I'm preggo right now so I can't speak to the wine, but they do have a wide selection including some reasonably priced options.   In addition, the restaurant is decorated very nicely with some antique pieces and the washrooms are super clean and have the smallest, cutest sinks I've ever seen.   This is definitely a Junction favourite and they even have a private room for larger parties. I can't imagine bringing anyone here and not having them rave about the place. It's an amazing restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing. I called for a reservation and was told they don't take reservations on Saturday night. They did, however, tell me that if I arrived in 30 minutes a table for 4 shouldn't be a problem. When we arrived, there was a table near the door but it was a cold winter night so I asked for something further in. We got a great table in the back of the restaurant. The restaurant is very narrow but I felt it had a cozy feeling rather than being tight. I had my 5 yr old son with me and felt the staff couldn't have been nicer to him. He spilled his drink and it was not a problem. I saw other children in the restaurant. We had a fantastic bottle of red wine. We had a warm olive and garlic knots appetizer that was good. They offer charcuterie that I saw at another table. Very artistically presented. I had an arroncini appetizer that was perfecto and brick oven pizza that was pretty spectacular. My Dad had a fish dish that he enjoyed and my Mom had a different pizza that was as delicious as mine. I really want to go back and have pasta or gnocchi. The bowls of pasta at other tables looked very appealing. We had house made cannoli for dessert. It's a must have. Our waitress was fantastic. We didn't feel rushed at all. The place has a very hip, NYC feel and apparently is very popular but the staff are warm and welcoming. Not arrogant or 'too cool'. If you are visiting TO highly recommend a stop here!"}
{"text":"An Italian restaurant with Italian wait staff and menus in Italian but they do not take reservations.  Not pretentious and quite pleasant even with my kids.  Their specialty is a rice ball which my kids love.  Not being a huge fan of Italian food I appreciate their attention to detail.  The wine list is quite comprehensive and they have a bar in back."}
{"text":"We tried Nodo in the Junction on a whim one evening in late December.  We arrived at 6pm and were seated right away but it got really busy, really fast.  We ordered the calamari/shrimps...the calamari was not that great...the shrimps were good.  My son had the pizza and being a kid, was turned off by the blackened/charred bottom (I guess from a wood oven?).  Honestly, I had a piece just to try it and it wasn't great.  I had the cornish hen dinner and it was SOOOO good.  I actually crave it just thinking about it.  My husband had some pasta (I can't remember which one - that's how unremarkable it was).  Overall, I really liked the atmosphere and the waiter was super nice to us but I don't think we'll be hurrying back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great and comforting Italian food in the Junction. Love the look of it, the service and the variety of dishes. It's my good to place in that area to eat at, also Grasshopper is great too. :)"}
{"text":"We went for Valentine's Day and opted for the set menu, as I always feel it's a good way to test out the menu. To start a Caesar salad with grilled corn which was an interesting add in, also liked the croutons but it was over dressed in oil. The rice balls were really good, larger in size which was a nice surprise. Our wonderful, sweet server Hanah recommended we try the beef short rib (fatty and disappointing)  and Gnocchi which was pan seared and in a heavy cream sauce which was ok, but also not something I would rush back for. Dessert we tried the cannoli (delicious)  and gelato which was interesting a bit sweet and bitter. The 1/2 liter of wine was a generous serving, the atmosphere was understated but sweet, and service was great. Unfortunately, it was a cold night and anyone sitting in the first half of restaurant was chilled every time the door was opened, we had a heater directly beside us but we still found it extremely chilly. I strongly recommend they invest in a second door vs. a curtain and continue the partial wall all the way up to the ceiling to help that issue, because in my opinion it is a major issue. People had their scarfs wrapped around their legs etc.  which definitely took away from the night."}
{"text":"Really enjoyable meal.  I had the gnocchi (New school style as opposed to Old school) which meant it was pan-fried.  It was light and springy.  The mushroom sauce was delicious.  It would have been perfect if there were a few more mushrooms. My husband had the pappardelle.  The pasta was perfect al denté and duck ragu was tasty.  The octopus appetizer was very good!  Not rubbery at all.  Ambience was lively, not cozy romantic.  Wine list by the glass was okay, but not great.  Complimentary bread was served with olive oil.  The olive oil was really nice with a touch of chilli.  Overall I was really satisfied with the meal and service."}
{"text":"It's not No-do, it's yes-do. Or whatever the kids say.   So I may be a little bit biased because I was craving pasta but, I had a fantastic experience here. As we sat down, we were served chickpea like bean things which helped satiate our hunger and then a bread basket and olive oil which was okay but not outstanding. Not entirely throwing all caution to the wind and embracing TGIF, the four of us decided to forego appetizers for the sake of our waistlines and ordered individual plates of pasta for our mains instead. Two of us ordered the brome lake pappardelle, one the Adriatico linguine and the last the Rapini Salsiccia Orecchiette. If I were to rate in order of best to last, it would be in this order:  1. Pappardelle - the noodles were fresh and cooked to absolute perfection. A perfect balance of rich duck and tart tomato, this was probably our favorite pasta of the four. I could literally eat these noodles non-stop. The only slight miss was the crispy sage which I felt there wasn't enough of.  2. Orecchiette - Again, this dish was executed well but, the reason it takes second place is how heavy it was. The noodles weren't quite as fresh as the pappardelle but the flavor was fantastic. While it took a bit of effort to get through because of how rich it was, the sausage combined with the garlic and cheese was fantastic.  3. Linguine - This pasta was good but definitely not standout. There was a good amount of seafood and the noodles were cooked well but it lacked the pizazz and finesse of the first two. Good, but not something I would go back for.   Now, I know I said we would play it safe for the sake of our waistlines, but after the delicious pastas we just couldn't resist dessert. Between the four of us, we shared the chocolate torte, caramel bread pudding and tiramisu. The tiramisu was the absolute best and IMO the second the chocolate torte and then the bread pudding. The alcohol and cream balance in the tiramisu was perfect but the chocolate torte was just missing something. Don't get me wrong, it was still good but not great (although the accompanying gelato was PERFECT). The bread pudding wasn't as decadent as we had hoped it to be and ended up last on our list.   Overall the experience was good. I would definitely come back for the pappardelle and would love to come back to try the pizza. Prices were mid-range but make sure your entire party is present or they won't seat you."}
{"text":"Been to Nodo twice now. I have enjoyed both visits immensely but be prepared to wait a bit, it fills up fast after 6pm. I went on a wednesday night and we chose to eat at the bar; which is super comfortable for a casual meal with a friend.  The bartender was friendly and helpful, yet respectful of privacy .   The service is always friendly, the atmosphere warm and the food is very flavourful.   Today I had the risotto of the day which included boneless short ribs and cherry tomatoes. It was perfectly cooked and so delicious! My friend started with the butternut squash soup, it was perfection!"}
{"text":"Appetizers were delicious! Mussels, squid, and fish were all great. Don't recommend the pasta as it is too salty. Dessert was awesome, get the chocolate torte with vanilla gelato :)"}
{"text":"We came in around 7pm on a Saturday night and was seated within minutes. I do have to say, the service was very friendly and attentive. After going through the menu three times (and I have to admit, I looked up the menu before we went to Nodo), we decided to go for the gnocchi (new school) and the steak, which was their special.  My friend enjoyed the gnocchi and savoured every last bite. He did not let any sauce go to waste. The steak was cooked well. It wasn't amazing and mind blowing but hey, its better than any steak I could make. I liked it but that being said, I had better steak.  Overall, this place was pretty solid with welcoming atmosphere. It is a great place to bring your friends to catch up.  Note: They do not take reservations and this place is bustling."}
{"text":"Fantastic place! I can see why everyone enjoys it. Good atmosphere and decor... Very eclectic. We had the burrata salad and the octopus, very yummy. Nice char on the octopus. Pasta was great and fresh. Save room for the Tiramasu"}
{"text":"Italian style food in a quaint style restaurant in the Junction.  Lunch time menu, lots to choose from pizza, salad, pasta and main dishes. I had Orecchietti pasta with rapine and hot barese sausage. Portion was generous and food was delicious.  Price point was average"}
{"text":"In my opinion nodo is one of the junctions best places to grab dinner. Really cool and intimate room, great serving staff, and really tasty dishes. Definitely either see if you can make a reservation in advance or be prepared to wait a while."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for the downstairs dining room and Nodo did not disappoint. Our party of 12 + baby sat comfortably in the private area. The waitress and staff were very helpful and nice. Great explanation of the menu and suggestion in pairings. The rice ball appetizer was amazing, crunchy outside, and soft and rich inside (comes in 2 almost pear shape balls). Pizza and pasta were solid. Great selection of home made desserts too. One of the best places I've been with a big group. Fantastic service!"}
{"text":"We decided to host a party here despite having never been to the restaurant. We reserved the private room which is quite nice and easily seats 16.  While it's in the basement by the bathrooms, it's fine!  We went with a medium prix fix menu, which I think is the only way to go with this sized crowd. Appetizer included a tasty Caesar salad, lamb skewers that were very good but a tad small and a bruschetta like 'pizza'  Main course was an amazing beef Raghu, risotto and grilled Cornish hen. Again all really tasty. Plus dessert.   The only thing contributing to a lower rating was the serving size - main serving was too small.  All of the guests had to be really careful to take very very small portions to serve everyone (eg one small spoonful of risotto, one piece of Cornish hen). I would say that we were at least two bowls of pasta, one plate of Cornish hen and one bowl of risotto short. Not a huge deal - everyone managed.   Wine selection was solid. Service was good and generally attentive for the party.   Would definitely go back and recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place! Everything was delicious, and actually decent portion sizes. The arugula salad is amazing! I had the daily risotto, with fig asparagus and burrata and my boyfriend had a pizza. We loved everything and the staff was extremely friendly and always checking up on you. The only downside would be that it was pretty loud in there. However, I wouldn't dock a star for it, just be prepared!"}
{"text":"Been at the restaurant on three different occasions and experienced really untasteful service.  First time we had some drinks, and we had a hard time finding a place at the bar. The second time we had tiramisu but there was a mistake made and the lattè wasn't hot enough. The third time I had dinner and this is what really did it for me. I ordered the special for the day and got a real tough piece of lamb roast, very chewy and dry. As a former server, I was appalled to be using the same silverware from my app for my main course. When I notified the manager of my displeasure with my meal, he simply offered us coffee...wow. The cappuccinos were badly made and since I'm a barista, it just culminated to the problem. He also had the audacity to say he would talk to the kitchen about my lamb but still we were only offered coffee for our trouble. What's worse, my friend ordered mussels and felt sick whe she got home. I also have friends who've had their mussels and have felt sick afterwards as well.   The space is really tiny and service is nothing special. This is only a review and does not necessarily reflect the attitude of everyone at that restaurant but it does reflect all of management and quite frankly I have stopped patronizing Nodo restaurant.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! What a lovely space, it's much bigger inside than it looks. Well worth the wait. The menu has some typical items and some very unique things as well. We had the warm olives, the rice balls, the cheese and meat plate and calamari to share - each was phenomenal. The cheese board came with a truffle honey, a chutney and pickled vegetables. A good selection of cured meats for 23$. We also tried the burrata salad (SO GOOD - so fresh and you get a HEAPING of burrata), a pizza (cooked to perfection, thin crust with the right amount of burnt pieces, great toppings, super fresh) and a pasta. All were absolutely amazing. The wine list is fabulous, the beer list is ok, very very nice cocktails as well. The service was the best I've had in the Junction for sure. Hard to get into on a weekend but not pretentious at all and really really worth stopping in."}
{"text":"This Italian resturant was recommended by my Italian friends that live in Woodbridge.  I cannot comment how authentic the food is, but it definitely tastes amazing!  The presentation is there, taste and everything makes sense.  It is only $$, and surely surpasses many $$$$ Italian places in the GTA.  The wine list is very interesting.  With 4-5 different fixed prices and with 8-10 wines in each group. The most expensive group of wines is $95, in there you will find $40-50 dollar wines from the LCBO which is a very reasonable markup"}
{"text":"Really nice food, ambiance- cozy, dimly lit and casual -but would be nice for a date as well-  and professional and friendly service. The servers were attentive and knew a lot about the food.The pasta and pizza are outstanding And the complimentary navy beans and bread  are a nice start to the meal. The prices are reasonable for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"So excited for another great restaurant in my 'hood.  We checked out Nodo for dinner on a rainy Wednesday night.  We were seated right away at a cute table for two near the window.  Great menu, lots of pizza and pasta options.  We ordered 2 different pizzas and swapped slices to try each.  Really good pizza, nice crust and a generous size for the $13-$15 price range (better than Queen Margherita West IMO).  We stayed away from the tempting wine list as I'm still on detox from my vacation and we skipped dessert as well.  Service was extremely good, our server checked in on us quite often.   We'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Great place. Great staff. Great owners. Clearly, they've been in the industry for a while because they really understand the consumer. Get the gnocchi. Killer."}
{"text":"Fantastic addition to the junction. Been here twice with muy wife and daughter and we all loved it.  Interesting pasta dishes, affordable wines hr the glass, good salads. Risotto was just ok on the second time. Off send like they have a different one every day.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Arrived at around 7:30pm on a Thursday with some friends and waited for about 5 minutes to be seated. I don't eat Italian very often but I'm glad that one of my girlfriends picked this place to try out. We ordered the rice ball and fried calamari for starters. Though they were both good I did have much higher expectations from the hyped up reviews. For our main, we ordered pizza, the new school gnocchi and the trinacria rigatoni. My friends and I agreed that the pasta was the best out of everything we ordered. The rigatoni is light made with a lot of fresh vegetables, a great summer pasta. The new school gnocchi was my favourite, it was pan fried and cooked perfectly through, though the portion leaned toward the smaller side. We ended off with the Tiramisu which was good as well. As for the service, they were friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"The place is very busy and doesn't take reservations, and parking is very difficult in the area, so plan accordingly.  The noise level was medium - normal for a place like this.  Service was excellent, but the menu required a magnifying glass.  My partner's food was a bit salty, but that's a pretty common problem, and it was otherwise very good.  Her flourless chocolate cake was excellent but the texture verged on chocolate souffle (which is fine - just sayin').  My short-ribs were excellent and so were the accompanying vegtables."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last night for Valentine's Day with my wife and we both loved it!   Great ambiance without being pretentious, friendly hosts and servers, and an amazing menu that is pleasantly less predictable than many Italian spots. A welcome addition to the neighbourhood - we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful service. Delicious food. The carpaccio was amazing as is the Caesar salad. I would return in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is delicious, ambiance is fantastic, and service has always been great. I live  very close by and have dined here for lunch and dinner a few times and it's consistent. The entries have all been very good, I normally order a pasta, fresh and delicious, flavourful and a good portion size, and my hubby will order a pizza. He's like them all so far. No complaints! This is probably my favourite resto in the junction- the food is awesome and decently priced (more than I can say for some other restos in the area...)  A special touch: They gave all the female patrons flowers on International Woman's Day! Awhh shucks, flowers for me? Supporting women's rights too? I'm smitten."}
{"text":"Wow! Ambiance 5* Food 4* Service 4*  Was recommended this place a year ago... totally should have gone a year ago!  Italian in the area doesn't get any better!  Go!  Seriously..stop reading reviews and go!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem (not so hidden) but for some reason I did not hear about it for far too long. Starting off with the olive oil- I knew it was going to be a good meal as soon as I tasted the olive oil-WOW. I ordered the margarita pizza, and two pastas and loved them both. Shout out to the rigatoni with smoked mozarella- one of the best pastas I've ever had. The portions were big (which I find to be rare these days) and the service was great. Have already returned twice, and cannot stop recommending it.  Looking forward to trying the gnocchi on my next visit!"}
{"text":"I  didn't really enjoy my experience here. We were in a large party close to the holidays and it was slammed. It took forever to get drinks (30 minutes ) and we only had 2 menus for 8 people. Each person had to pass the menu to decide. Our appetizers took 30 minutes and our mains came 45 minutes later. We had a child with us and she was just so hungry and cranky by the time the apps came.  The food was okay. The risotto balls are good and my pizza was fine but I was so frustrated I just wanted to leave.  The music is too loud and the ambience lighting too dark. Far too trendy and under staffed for me."}
{"text":"What a gem of a place! Had the charcuterie and cheese place to start. The variety was delicious, but the best part was the truffle honey! Couldn't have enough of it. I had the pappardelle duck ragu, which was very tasty and a great portion. My husband had the pizza with generous amounts of burrata, sausage and rapini. The service was fantastic and the servers were knowledgeable. I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Nodo is my home away from home. At some point it became about a lot more than the food, which is great to start with. Staff, modern Italian food, drinks, atmosphere - everything is top notch. I couldn't recommend it more."}
{"text":"Delicious. Great price. Great atmosphere!  Went with my husband and inlaws for dinner and everyone had a fantastic time. My MIL wanted to try something in the junction and great reviews here helped us choose this gem. The waitress was excellent. Explained everything and answered all our questions. Food was well paced and delicious. We ordered olives for appetizer and it was a huge portion (YUM!) and i had the pasta with cauliflower for dinner. We shared icecream for dessert. I recommend sharing apps and dessert as they are pretty big portions.  Everyone loved the food.   Best Italian I have had in Toronto!  (looking forward to going again soon!)"}
{"text":"I had been eyeing this place for some time now when I finally decided to give it a try for Hubby's and I birthday dinner.  We came in on a Friday night a bit after 7pm and the place was packed. FYI they don't take reservations. We were kindly welcomed in by a host who informed us it would be a 20 minute wait but we could have a seat at the bar which offers the full service dinner menu and the waiter would grab us when our table was ready. We decided to wait it out on the bench by the front as we watched more and more patrons come in. 20 minutes later true to his word our table was ready and the wait time had increased to 40+ minutes.  We were led through the dim lit restaurant to the last table against the communal tufted black leather banquet that ran along both lengths of the restaurants. I particularly liked this table as it felt much more intimate as there was no one seated to the left of us and we had great views of the bar, kitchen, and entire restaurant.   Our bubbly and friendly waitress came over to greet us and went over the entire menu with us and was super informative giving us honest opinions and helping us choose between dishes.  We started the night with some crisp and refreshing pinot grigio that came served in a funky jug with a rooster on it. We were then brought over some complimentary bread with olive oil and lupini beans - which our waitress described to us as the Italian version of edamame.  To begin our meal we shared a salad. Rucola E Fungi - Organic baby arugula, wild mushroom, goat cheese, toasted walnut, diced radish, lemon-balsamic vinaigrette Very fresh tasting, I enjoyed the tangy dressing against the spicy arugula with the creamy goat cheese and crunchy toasted nuts  For our mains we decided to share two entrees and a side  Rigatoni Bolognese - Slow cooked veal, pork, beef ragu, reggiano Very large portion of pasta cooked to a perfect al dente. My only complaint was the lack of meat. I was expecting a rich chunky meat sauce but there was only a few crumbles of meat through out the huge bowl of pasta which was mainly coated in the san Marzano tomato sauce which was still delicious.  Lamb Costolette D'Agnello - Fire-grilled, marinated lamb chops, rainbow beets, roasted brussels, garlic rapini, rustic herb potato, nebbiolo-demi Cooked to a perfect medium rare the lamb was so succulent and flavourful! Again another large portion, 4 chops sitting on a bed crushed potatoes and a gorgeous array of winter vegetables. It was definitely the highlight of our meal.  Blackened Brussels, shallot, maple-cider I adore brussel sprouts and always have to order them whenever I see them on the menu. These were particularly good with a yummy sweet and tangy glaze lightly blackened and with still a bit of crunch to them - I ate every last one!  I was super stuffed by the time we finished our mains but who am I to ever refuse dessert especially when it's your birthday!  Chocolate Torta Cioccolata - Warm Flourless chocolate torte, artisan vanilla gelato, white-honey, crushed nuts I'm a sucker for a warm chocolate cake especially when paired with gelato. What I really liked about this cake was it was more of a dark chocolate flavour and leaning towards the bitter side of chocolate which was great after all that rich food and it really complimented the sweet and creamy vanilla bean gelato. I scraped every last bit of my dessert off the plate.  Tiramisu - Classic Italian tiramisu made with fresh mascarpone Hubby loves tiramisu so he had to order this. Of course I got to snag a couple large mouthfuls and it was also to die for! Just the perfect take on this popular Italian classic.  I can truly see why this place is soo packed the service here is just amazing. Our waitress was soo warm and friendly - she surprised us with candles in our desserts and all the waiters wished us a happy birthday as we were leaving. The food came out in perfect timing with wonderful flavours and hearty portions, and the ambiance here makes you not want to leave. One downside to this place is that the tables are pretty tiny and it was circus trying to juggle all the huge plates of food. The servers were really great at clearing plates when you were done and trying their best to make everything fit. We were lucky we had no one beside us as we were able to stretch out and have more space. It's definitely worth checking out but make sure you stay away from the centre tables along the banquet as they are really squished together."}
{"text":"Excellent food , excellent service, excellent atmosphere. I loved the beans served at the beginning of the meal and the marguerite pizza was to die for! I would definitely eat here again.  I went during lunch and I ordered, ate and got my bill within 45 mins. Great service and decor was really euro."}
