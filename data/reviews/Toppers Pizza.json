{"text":"The only reason you should ever order Toppers that is if it's like 3 in the morning and you're drunk and have the munchies. During normal operating business hours you can find a way better Pizza even at the chains like Papa John's and Domino's."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the other reviews were drinking before eating here or if they've ever eaten real pizza but this is nothing more than bad chain pizza.  The pizza is chewy, the sauce is ketchup and the pepper in the box reeks of Papa John's knock off.  I only ate pizza and bread sticks twice and the second time was only because if I didn't, I'd have to wait another 3 hours to eat.  I should have waited the 3 hours.  Ugh!"}
{"text":"Just like mentioned earlier, when this location opened, it was awesome.  But, at that time, they were under different management.  Now, it's ridiculous!  The pizza is good.  The deliver people are always pleasant.  But, the customer service is terrible, and the website is even worse than terrible.  For example - I just ordered from the website and it took 30 minutes to order two pizzas.  Thirty minutes!  But, to be honest, I'd rather order online than have to call and talk to someone.  The delivery guys/gals are constantly apologizing for the orders being delivered passed the quoted time.  If the pizza wasn't so good and it wasn't a mile from our house, we'd order from somewhere else.  I wish the previous owner still had it.  He knows how to run a company."}
{"text":"Got to a hotel late night as we missed a flight. We were very tired and hungry. My son wanted pizza. So we ordered from Toppers. The place and concept is good. They were very busy as a lot of hotels were filled with passengers on either cancelled or delayed flights. 

We ordered our food with a guy name Khalil. He put us on hold numerous times. The music on hold was stating their beverage deals were : a 2 liter for $2 and two 20oz for $2. So after he finally come on the line, I asked him if they had any deals. He mentioned a few of the pizza deals but just ended up ordering a large pie with half buffalo chicken and the other half with mushroom, peppers, and sausage also added onions and jalape√±os. Also medium order of boneless wings. (Hot buffalo - it was spicy and good)

I mentioned that I wanted to take advantage of the beverage deals. Ordered a 2 liter of Diet Coke and 2 Dasani 20oz. 

They over charged me for the water. Instead of charging 2 for $2 they charged me $2 each. They also got me for a $2.25 delivery fee they did not mentioned to me. 


So I called the restaurant back and mentioned them about the over charge. Instead of apologizing the guy who took my order who happens to be the manager states \"well it is your fault for not mentioning the deal\". I told him that I did. He stated that it is your word against mine. 

I still told him that if he just acknowledges that they made a mistake I would want him to give the extra $2 to the deliver guy ( who by the way was already tipped $4 by me on top of the delivery fee. 


While good food and service can take a business to the sky, being rude and disrespectful to your customers can only eventually bring down a business. 

I would want everybody who reads this to just make sure of what they are charging before paying. Also I would hope that this so called \"manager\" gets reprimanded by the owner of not FIRED."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. First of all, the service is great. I've unfortunately had a few problems with pizzas I've ordered in the past, but they are rockstars in trying to get it right and making sure you're taken care of. So major props for that.
I hate that I don't live in their delivery radius anymore, because they are the best pizza franchise I've ever been to. The pizza is tremendously good. It tastes like quality. Plus their wings are the best I've had from any kind of franchise place in general (even most local places don't have wings as good, often times).
If I'm ever passing through, I'll always stop in and get a pie."}
{"text":"First time placing an order, pizza and wings were delicious. Great and courteous delivery person.  Early delivery on top of that. Will recommend to family and friends"}
{"text":"The other reviews definitely aren't lying about this place being awful. Our pizza arrived late (more than an hour after ordering), and incorrectly made. I guess one shouldn't expect much more from a chain pizza joint. The extra couple bucks at a \"better\" pizza parlor would be well worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome and quick pizza. Got a loaded baked potato pizza, super unique menu and will def be trying the bratwurst one next. Delivery guy was really cool as well and friendly. Garlic wings are on point!"}
{"text":"Slow delivery, over an hour. Tasted very similar to Domino's."}
{"text":"I love Toppers! I'm use to the 1 in university but I've ordered from this 1 twice now and it's just as good! The pizza is different yet good. Build your own or get one of the many \"house\" pizzas. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This here is some damn good pizza. 

I went out on a limb in trying a local pizza joint. I'm used to going to Papa John's, Domino's, Pizza Hut and the other major players in the game. Mostly because local pizza places fail miserably. 

Well I've never been more wrong and it feels so right! OMG! Toppers is my new crack. First off can we commend them for believing in the size small?! And a second commendation for delivering that size?! Oooh baby. 

Oh my goodness the dipping sauces. It's like do you want this bomb ass pizza to be even better?! Man oh man. Garlic Parmesan!!!

I wish they had a membership. I wasn't even high when I bit, bit, engulfed it in 3 bites. Yum!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here a few weeks ago and forgot to yelp it. I had a busy day at work so I didn't feel like making anything for dinner that evening. So what else but pizza! I looked over the menu online and finally decided on a deal they had for 2 medium pizzas. I went with their version of the \"supreme\" and their take on a bacon burger pizza. But we're good, but nothing special. Over all I'd give toppers a 3 star rating. About the same quality and price as you could expect from dominos"}
{"text":"I miust say we have not been dissappointed with Toppers Pizza.  They provide Excellent and timely delivery.  Pizza was hot and delicious!  I would recommend and will continue to order from Toppers.  Extended hours are also great."}
{"text":"Grateful for a place open so late when stuck in Charlotte after a failed flight. Sounds from others like the pizza is the way to go. Wings were okay but small, and would be much better if they came with some carrots and celery."}
{"text":"We tried Toppers for the first time recently. The order-taker was pleasant and informative as we asked questions about the offerings. She wasn't at all rushed or dismissive as some other pizza parlor staff sometimes are. 

When the pizza arrived, we found the hand-tossed crust was just right, the sauce was tasty,  the toppings seemed fresh, and it was delivered quickly. Best of all, the delivery guy was happy and engaging What more can one ask for?

We'll be ordering from Toppers again soon! In fact, tonight!"}
{"text":"Hot, delicious pizza with fresh ingredients delivered to my hotel at almost 3 in the morning. A little pricier than most chains, but who delivers that late? Unexpected and appreciated."}
{"text":"My family got stuck in Charlotte for the night and we wanted pizza.  The clerk at the hotel told us about Toppers. Well since pizza is my all time favorite thing to eat I have to say ..amazing! I loved it!  We got a one topping and a taco topper and they were both delicious!  Wish we had a toppers in Missouri! We got delivery and it was at our hotel in about 20 min! They are also open until 3am!"}
{"text":"I have ate so many pizza places including other Toppers and no experience could compare to this location in fort mill. Literally had a 1 hour wait and kept getting told it's almost done only to find out it was never in the over then the pizza came out 20 minutes before cheese sticks. Crazy awful experience. Couldn't explain how bad the experience was."}
{"text":"I'm just a big fan of the Original Cheese Topperstix with ranch. Always have and always will.  I'm not a huge fan of their regular pizzas however. If I wanted a pepperoni pizza, i normally would go elsewhere. The pricing is a little higher than competitors. My rating is solely based on my latest triple order of Topperstix. 

One of my \"pet peeves\" when it comes to the triple order is: the first slice or two on the outsides barely have any cheese and its like crunchy crust. Once you get into the middle slices, the cheese is like heaven and it is well cooked! You just have to wait until you get to the good stuff. (Unless you cheat and go right for the good pieces). Anyone else agree with me on that?

If Toppers can figure that out (and maybe lower their prices), then I would definitely give them 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Some good pizza and they are open late which helps for late night munchies. The taco stix are worth trying also!

I believe it to be better than the regular Papa Johns or little Caesars by a long shot!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here.  We found it while driving up South Blvd in South Charlotte.  We ordered a Topper's Classic Supreme pizza to go while we waited, about 15 minutes.  Pizza was hot and fresh tasting."}
{"text":"Open during snow storm; needless to say it made me happy. Friendly and patient staff (super busy night) and good fast pizza."}
{"text":"The other reviews I have read about this place pretty much hit the nail on the head.....the quality is super cheap yet they charge outrageous prices for their food.  This is another place we have ordered up from more than once because its close to our house and I will say their delivery is fast.  But, everytime the food arrives, we are ALWAYS disappointed with some aspect of it and the price is just too much.  We ordered a large specialty pizza and a dozen boneless wings and it was $33!!!  With that kind of money I could have purchased three large pizzas at a place like Domino's and gotten better quality.  Plus, they didn't tell us the total over the phone so it was just a bombshell when it arrived.  The taco pizza is gross, the grinders are too small, and the \"Topperstix\" aren't great either.  I do, however, like the boneless wings and we've had the macaroni and cheese pizza......I hate to say it, but it's damn tasty.  All in all, pretty weak food.  They get a star for fast delivery and another for the mac and cheese, but that's about it."}
{"text":"We love our pizza so it can be difficult to find a place that has new, different, out of the box toppings. This place nailed it! We got their loaded tot-zza, which is their most popular, and toppers classic. I absolutely fell in love with the loaded tot-zza as I LOVE my tater tots.

They have a crazy amount of sauces to choose from and three kinds of crusts. They also have gluten free options. You can tell they take pride in their work and believe in quality, not just getting pizzas out the door. 

Cute place, friendly polite staff, and delicious pizza. They are only take out or delivery. Bummer, I would have loved to sit and eat our creations."}
{"text":"I love me some toppers and I have to say pretty much every toppers looks and is about the same so let me speak on the quality of food and staff coming out of this place. First of all, I have never had any bad food from this location. It is always hot, and doesn't taste re-heated. The staff? They are fast and friendly whether it's picking something up or having it delivered, this is one of the best locations for that. Pretty happy with this place, what else can ya ask for?"}
{"text":"As others have stated, when Toppers first came to town, I was delighted to have another option for delivery. Pizza was good and came on time. On about the 3rd or 4th order, everything changed. We waited for well over an hour before I called to check on it. The girl on the phone apologized, but didn't seem to know what was going on. We waited and waited. Finally, after a couple of hours, the pizza arrived. No one ever called to explain or anything. NEVER AGAIN! There is simply too much competition in the area to tolerate this. We have ordered from Marco's Pizza countless times and even though the website says it will be here in 40 minutes, it almost always arrives in 20 minutes and the order is perfect. Danny's Pizza in Tega Cay is another great pizza delivery. Slightly slower, but they  give you an accurate estimate of delivery time and always deliver great pizza. Their lasagna is good also. I won't give Toppers another chance, they blew it!"}
{"text":"YEAAAAHHHH! Super pizza specials and fresh ingredients? YES PLEASE. I tell all the guests where I work to give Toppers a try because they deliver quickly, have friendly service, and great food! 

My personal favorite is cheese and mushroom pizza as you can't ever go wrong with that. A large is around $10. If you're looking for a specialty pizza, be sure to try the philly cheesesteak pizza. It might sound gross, but I assure you, it's delish! The ranch based sauce adds a nice flair to it.

I've heard that the subs here, called \"grinders\" are really tasty.
So, if you're ever in the University area and need a pizza delivery place, Toppers will never let you down.

The only negative aspect is that there is no seating or pizza by the slice, otherwise this place would get five stars."}
{"text":"Ordered late. Got it fast. Delivery driver was cool.  And the food is great.  Very impressed. Great experience"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful!!! Website sucks, employees suck and pizza sucks! Shame on me for giving it a 2nd chance and having a worse experience the second time. Go elsewhere!!! Complete joke!!! Will never recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"We had to order carry out since our address is still new, they could not deliver which we are use to. Very glad we weren't able to order delivery because these guys were higher than a kite on a windy day.
We ordered the California pizza and Taco topper sticks. VERY disappointed, the taco sticks were lacking in all the toppings and the pizza lacked toppings too and was tough to even chew. After attempting a second slice I discovered a long bronze curly hair graciously tangled in the cheese. Husband said that it looked just like the kids hair who cashed him out.
I would not recommend this place to anyone not even my enemies."}
{"text":"I had a veggie pizza which I felt was a bit pricey for what it had on it. I picked it up in person after ordering it on phone.

The pizza was well baked but had few veggies on it. They charge for everything extra. I think the meat options were better. The portion size was about enough for one person.

Service was good to excellent. The staff was courteous and quick and the premises were clean. I may go again but I will certainly look for what the competitors have."}
{"text":"We've eaten there twice and the end result both times was diarrhea. The pizzas were loaded with toppings, yet had the taste of wet cardboard, even less.

My official opinion - blech."}
{"text":"I always have a great experience here!!

The cheese sticks were awesome and so was the thin crust cheese pizza. It's a must for easy quick pizza. It was my first time the other day and i was pleasantly surprised how good it was. Surely it won't be my last! 

M - W   $7.99 large special



Tip - Ask for the Thin Crust to be a light quick cook, so it doesn't come out burnt or too crunchy.  They have always done it right for us!!"}
{"text":"Love it for variety and flavor! It's awesome to have delicious and hot food delivered to your door with a smile. Wish they were open now!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery to my hotel I was staying in on a business trip the website is very user friendly. The pizza arrived sooner than expected and was hot. Overall a good pie I would order again if I'm ever in town. Pizza was great the next day cold too"}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town a few days ago. We tend you flock to \"non chain\" restaurants while traveling. We searched yelp for pizza places that deliver d to our hotel. We chose Toppers because of the reviews and deals. We ended up ordering 2 large pizzas. Old school pepperoni and sausage & the ultimate pepperoni.  Online ordering was extremely easy. I made a note to have them bring plates and napkins. (Pizza delivery almost never includes these). I can't even remember how long the pizzas took to be delivered. It wasn't that long at all. The delivery driver was VERY nice and polite. He brought enough extra napkins and plates for a few servings. He also added crushed red peppers and Parmesan packets. Now onto the pizzas! Both were fresh and hot. The Ultimate Pepperoni has just the right amount of kick to it. It was spicy but not unbearable. The pepperoni and sausage was very good. The roasted tomatoes really added extra flavor. We we definitely order again when we are back in the area."}
{"text":"When they first opened we were like, this is a great alternative to the others. Pizza was good, orders were complete. Fast forward to today, order took over 1 hour 45 minutes, pizza was COLD, wings were soggy and we were missing our sauces. 

This has happened on the last two orders. We called to speak to a manager about our dissatisfaction and how this has happened two times in a row and the manager proceeded to call my wife \"Rude\". No empathy at all. Just a, that's the way it is attitude. 

Good luck to your business. Your Corporate Office  will also receive this feedback."}
{"text":"I am very selective when it comes to pizza. I usually stay away from the chains, but Toppers surprised me.

 I was out on business, and it was late, Toppers was my choice do to lack of choices, but I was pleasantly surprised with the taste. It was okay, and satisfying. 

I do think they should have better options for individual orders."}
{"text":"Awesome always really good. steaming hot and fresh very consistent and a perfect pizza every time!!"}
{"text":"I had to stay at a hotel in Charlotte because my house was being worked on. I had Toppers delivered to my room...I was impressed.

I had the small buffalo chicken pizza and an order of topperstix (berry). The pizza was good, nothing too special but the berry topperstix were amazing! I got extra frosting and berry sauce-which I recommend doing, not because you will need them, but because the berry sauce is SOOO good and since I had some left over I used it on my waffles the next morning! 

Delivery guy was nice and courteous and delivery for a Friday night wasn't too bad (I think about 30ish mins)"}
{"text":"Waited an hour and a half for my pizza. This is ridiculous. It is only 3 miles away from my house. I am so disappointed and will never order food from here again"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad pizza from Toppers. When delivered, the pizza always arrives hot and on time with friendly drivers. The new pricing system (one price for up to two toppings, a higher price for 3+) is super helpful, much more efficient than charging by the topping. The Topperstix are deliciously cheesy (or sweet, depending on your order). I have never tried the wings. 
The pizzas are definitely more expensive than the national brands, but in my opinion, it's worth it for the options you get and definitely for the quality of the pie. All the crusts are hand tossed and made fresh. 
My go to is a large cheese with mushrooms, roasted garlic, and garlic tomatoes. With garlic sauce. I like garlic. Sue me."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery my first night in town.
Loved the cheese sticks with the Garlic Butter dip. 
The pizza was A-OK. 
In flavor, the crust reminded me of the national pizza chain with the red white and blue logo. 
More toppings that that chain. 
I woudl pick Toppers over that other chain."}
{"text":"The toppers sticks are really good and the people working there are even better. I've noticed the staff has become friendlier and more helpful in the past couple months. If youre looking for delicious greasy pizza toppers is a go-to."}
{"text":"Had great experiences with other toppers pizza. They left out ingredients that my pizza carried. Called back to let them know and the person on the phone didn't seem to care. Just not good customer service."}
{"text":"So I want to preface this review stating that this is heavily based on my customer service experience that I just had with this location. 

I called to see about having a pizza delivered. I live 3 miles from the location. I get someone on the phone who couldn't focus on the call we were having, kept talking to other people, couldn't figure out where they deliver, and was actually kind of rude. I gave my address (which is a fairly new build) and he was like oh we don't deliver there. I mentioned I was less than 5 miles from them and asked for their delivery radius. He didn't know and said they delivered all around me but not me. My problem is that I have seen their delivery drivers here in my apartment complex NUMEROUS times!! So when looking on the map it shows that I'm not in their delivery radius, makes no sense but apparently I'm not. So what I don't understand is why they deliver here to some people and not others? Are they delivering to friends, or is this because they don't know what's going on in their own store? 

Basically I'll give 2 stars because the pizza is actually decent but if I see your cars delivering to my neighbors and when I call you won't deliver to me yeah I'm going to give a bad review. Seems like really poor business management and customer service!! The other reviews I've read make me think this isn't a one time issue."}
{"text":"I really like toppers. The stixs are a good idea. What I don't like about them is that they cost more then Dominoes. What I do like about them is there a minimum order is lower. The food taste about the same. Really perfect for the college crowd."}
{"text":"Lots of negative reviews here, and from what I'm gathering, a lot of it has to do with the location in the UNCC neighborhood. Well, I live by the one on South Blvd, and I have to say that Toppers is the best chain pizza around, at least TASTE wise. Being from Chicago, I am used to very flavorful pizza. I'm not hung up on the \"has to be like NYC pizza\" either, because I love all good pizza. But what makes Toppers a good pizza is the quality of their ingredients and the overall taste. Their sausage is VERY good, and their sweet marinara and cheese is also VERY good. This is the good part....

Now the bad. This is also the MOST expensive pizza in Charlotte! Their coupons mostly consist of free bread sticks and soda. I can give a flying $^!*#$@ about these things when I'm ordering PIZZA! Because my wife and I don't like the same things on our pizzas, we order 2 MEDIUM size pies each with about 3 or 4 toppings. With tax, delivery and tip, this typically runs about $43.00!!! For TWO medium pizzas. Yup, that's right.

Now compare that with Domino's, Papa John's, etc. Doing the math, I figure it's about 40% MORE in cost than Toppers. Is Toppers better than the others, Yes! Is it WORTH that much more.....well, that depends on your point of view and if you can afford $40+ pizzas. SOMETIMES I think it's worth it, sometimes I do NOT.

I actually complained about the price, and the South Blvd Store Manager gave me a coupon for a free Med Pizza with whatever toppings I wanted. That was nice, but the one pizza I paid for still cost me $23.00! For a MEDIUM with 3 toppings! THAT is pretty steep.

So if anyone from Toppers Management is reading what folks have to say, they really need to re-think their pricing and sales strategies. They have a good product, but their pricing is just too high for this market."}
{"text":"Ordered the Ragin' Pepperoni, Bacon Cheese sticks and Parmesian Buffalo Wings from Toppers for the first time here and the food is awesome! The delivery guy was really cool too, he made sure to even call us and let us know when he'd be delivering our order. Great customer service and I'll definitely be ordering from Toppers regularly from now on."}
{"text":"If you have had conveyor oven franchise pizza then you have had Toppers. The flavor is on par with every other major pizza chain and like every other major pizza chain they reheat chicken wings and sauce them up instead of cooking them fresh. Don't get me wrong - it's not terrible but it's not authentic pizza like Empire or Lorenzo's. If you are having a party and need a lot of pizza or if you live nearby, it is worth a visit. They have some gimmicks such as tater tots and noodles for toppings. Also, you get a free flavored sauce with each pizza which is nice when the pizza does not stand out on its own.

It is nice that the franchisee lives in Fort Mill. He owns the two Charlotte Toppers. However, if you are the type of person that prefers pizza baked in a real oven and not franchised pizza , this place is not for you."}
{"text":"Your average fast and basic pizza. Nothing special but they are open late. Their wings were not very good."}
{"text":"This has always been a great place to get some late night pizza. But what is the deal with delivery? I can get pizza delivered from every other pizza company but not here. I am 3 miles away. They have no real delivery area. When I asked what the area was they gave me some BS about it was like that before the store opened. While I waited on my pizza to be made, a driver left with a pizza bound for more than 5 miles away. This will be the last time I order here. Do yourself a favor and don't get food from here either."}
{"text":"If Tron answers the phone please understand that your order would be correct and complete."}
{"text":"Toppers knows how to take the fast pizza & take-out model to a higher level.  Great food, great service.  Really love the crust and pizza sauce, wings are excellent and specialty cheese bread is a nice addition.  Much better value than larger national brands.  My family loves it and we're never going back to the others!"}
{"text":"yuck.  i think Topper's is pretty gross.  Def the cheapest (quality wise) pizza in town.  They do have a varied menu and are open very late, but i wouldn't eat most of the things on the menu.  I guess the food appeals more to drunk college kids than to me, but if you're ordering food at 3 am, it's likely that the quality you are expecting is below par.  If you go for a cheese pizza you should be ok, but you'd be just as well off with a frozen pie from the grocery."}
{"text":"Being a NY I expect a lot from pizza - but I didn't expect a hole lot from Charlotte pizza (rumor has it there isn't great pizza around here).  The pizza wasn't bad actually - however for the price (a large for $25 with delivery/tip) I want a bigger pie.  This was about the size of medium and the toppings were not at all adequate.  However the crust was decent and the sauce was actually pretty good.  But the size and limited toppings made it not worth the price.  VERY disappointed with the size...we will not be trying this any time soon"}
{"text":"On vacation wanted something different!  We were told 30-45min for delivery, order arrived steaming hot in 20min & correct!!!!!!! Pizza was delicious and wings were tasty. Only reason not 5 star is I like my wings crispy."}
{"text":"I have really enjoyed their pizza! Their customer service and their employees ability to talk with courtesy to customers is seriously lacking. I've spoken with their manager, and he has been more than kind, but the kids taking their phone orders need to be trained."}
{"text":"We ordered two pizzas, one thin crust and one regular and an order of hot wings at 2:22 for delivery. Tom said thirty minutes. The delivery guy was here at 3:00. The pizza was good and the hot wings were hot. It was worth the wait but I just wish we had got a better time estimate. We didn't make an issue and still tipped but I can see where someone else might not. It was our first time ordering there and I think I would recommend this over the usual pizza chains."}
{"text":"3/4 times had a horrible experience. Most recent tonight. Took 50 minutes to receive a pizza that was a carry out order that was supposed to be ready in fifteen. Not to mention the initial ordering of the pizza itself took 15 minutes and 2 employees, just to find out my order was never even placed. Offered nothing but for me to have good night. No apology or anything. Never again."}
{"text":"SO five stars is as far as they let me go on yelp but if we had 10 stars toppers would get it! I was a dominos fan...I lived for dominos, I even thought about getting a tattoo to express me love for it (not really) But when I tried toppers for the first time I have divorced the Taylor Swift of Pizza and upgraded to BEYONCE! The Name Toppers is so appropriate because there are so many toppings! And get this..you can put TATOR TOTS ON YOUR PIZZA!!!! Pizza lovers only dream of such greatness! I always get their tallboys because the regular crust can't handle the amount of love they put on their pizza. I always use this location, the people here are really nice and I appreciate that a lot. My Toppers obsession is so real that that time we had all the snow and ice in Charlotte I drove 5 miles an hour in ice to get to Toppers, slid my car like 6 times but that pizza was so good and worth it! I promise you if you are not sure if you want to try this place...TRY IT! Once you go Toppers you never go back! I am just waiting until they get a deep dish pizza!!!! I will probably gained 900lbs in a year if they did that but it would be so worth it! Visit Toppers guys, you won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and super fast delivery.  Get the three little pigs you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"1st and last visit. Service was great not so much for the pizza. Very dry as there was no sauce on the pizza. Toppings were good but very little cheese. As another reviewer noted similar to Domino's but no sauce. Try any other pizza place it will be better."}
{"text":"Fresh Pizza Tons of Choices! I had Garlic- Parmesan wings. 9\" Meat Trio Pizza! 

LOVED - LOVED - LOVED - LOVED 
 
GARLIC PARMESAN WINGS!! 

Helpful Staff

Unique Pizza Combinations 

DISLIKED - DISLIKED - DISLIKED 

It was totally my fault, but I didn't eat my pizza fast enough and it changed the texture and taste of the crust.."}
{"text":"The staff were really nice despite the fact that they looked short staffed and it was pouring outside. They were very consistent with how they handled each customer. Only missing a star because it took longer than it should have for my pizza, but it's okay because I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery while in a hotel. It didn't take long, the food was good. We got the buffalo chicken topper and 3 cheese garlic bread sticks. I think it had mushroom on it which I didn't know. I don't really have any complaints."}
{"text":"Favorite delivery pizza in town.  Great selection of pies!  Delicious.  Only place we order from now."}
{"text":"My new obsession: Toppers pizza and topperstix.  Crust is amazing, tons of cheese, AND scrumptious dipping sauces!  Prices are pretty reasonable.  They have this crazy good signature Tall Boy crust, which is coated on both sides with garlic butter.  Doesn't help you lose weight, but it sure does taste yummy. 

The service has always been super friendly.  Both on the phone and in the store.  They wait patiently on the phone while I ponder what dipping sauce I want and seem really happy to be taking the order.  We always do carry out since it's so close to where we live, and our orders have been ready in 15-20 minutes every time.  

LOVE it.  Will order weekly from now until infinity."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering Toppers and delivery in Charlotte is limited so my expectations were low.  I was pleasantly surprised. The pizza was good and delivery was fast!! It was a bit pricey but the spicy pepperoni was delicious and the thin crust really good. We will order from here again!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Service was excellent, price was fair, and the food was great! Did I mention they have 3456884256 different sauces for your crust?"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here a few times. Everytime I was disappointed by the quality. Barely warm, lacking toppings, and cheese. Not at all what I've known toppers to be. The best location from my experience is the fitchburg location near the super target. Unfortunately I moved near this location. Guess I'll have to find a new favorite pizza spot."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best delivery pizza places in CLT!

They are opened till 3am every night! So all of the late night peeps can much on some awesome grindage. I have ordered delivery every single time & picked up a pizza there, only once when they had a pick up special (which they do quite often). 
The thin crust well done pizza (any kind) is always the best. While the topperstix are always chewy n gooey. The wings are pretty good too. Not breaded & full of juicy flavor.

If you are in one of the areas that Toppers delivers pick them over Pizza Hut, Papa Johns or Dominos. You will not be disappointed:)

I am no longer in an area that has a Toppers and it is just a crying shame

Boo Hoo"}
{"text":"Hey...not bad!  Not bad at all!

Here in Charlotte NC on a business trip and the front desk of my Hyatt Plac suggested Toppers.  So I caved...and ordered online...a 12\" thin crust with Italian sausage, mushrooms, and black olives.

Came to $19.07 which included a delivery fee of $2.25 to the hotel.

Other than being luke warm when the delivery guy dropped it off at my hotel room, it was delicious.  Wonderful Chicago thin-crust style with plenty of toppings.  Great taste too.  No complaints whatsoever.

Nice job Toppers!"}
{"text":"I think I've been eating too healthy lately to give this greasy mess a decent review.
I ordered the Cheeseburger Pizza. I told the young man I didn't like ranch dressing and they put it on anyway. 1 demerit. I also told him I didn't feel like anything sour or greasy and to go easy on the cheese and no butter glaze.They put pickles on it and too much cheese. So they earned the 2 stars fair and square."}
{"text":"This is the review that I posted on May 20: This review is for their thin crust and hand tossed crust pizza only.  Pizza was delicious, and delivery was fast.   For the second topping we ordered extra cheese, and they were generous with that.  Delivery guy had stuff to give, like packets of parmesan cheese, peppers, napkins, etc all.   That was a nice touch.

And now, here is my June 3 update: 

URGENT WARNING: This pizza is highly addictive, and may cause you to make unplanned late-night calls to order a delivery.  In addition to being highly addictive, there is no known anecdote.  So, please be advised that when they try and lure you into ordering their pizza with one of their special deals, they are just trying to get you hooked!"}
{"text":"I always saw coupons and wanted to try Toppers when I was at UNCC, but my loyalty to Papa Johns never allowed it. I tried Toppers a few years ago, and for a while we were ordering the philly cheesesteak pizza, minus mushrooms add banana peppers, once or twice a week. I also really love the potato pizza. I don't order it much though since my husband doesn't like it. We still order from here whenever we get pizza, but not as often as before."}
{"text":"This place is horrible! Our order was 40 minutes late; the cashier was rude, lied to us about starting our pizza the first time we went to pick it up, and tried to make us pay for the pizza in the store even though we had already paid online; the order was wrong (we paid extra for thicker crust and didn't get it plus one of our dipping sauces was missing); and one of our pizzas was completely doughy. Seriously, don't waste your money! We threw almost a whole pizza away because we couldn't eat it."}
{"text":"I must say that Toppers has got Pizza Hut and Papa Johns beat in this university area. Not only are the pizzas always delivered HOT and cooked to perfection but the delivery time is so fast!!! I've always received my order In 30-45 minutes. The pizza is fresh and BOGO Tuesdays are a family favorite. One less day I have to cook during the week."}
{"text":"All I can say is, \"WOW\" and \"Thank you\". If you have ever gone to Charlotte before, you know their \"late night\" food choices are very skim. Well, I didn't know. It's been years since I've actually gone to the Queen City. No one wants McDonald's and we all get tired of cookout (but we love it haha). So when I looked up what was open late on the map, this place popped up. I had to drive a little further, but it was worth it. I walked in and Mike helped us. He had great customer service especially with this being my first time coming. He then explained the specials and I took a risk and got the buffalo chicken pizza. When I say, \"WOW\" .. I mean wow. LOL, if that makes sense. It was one of the best buffalo chicken pizzas that I have tried. The chicken and the sauces are a great combination. Then Mike suggested we try it with the chipotle ranch. life .. changing. 

I wish we had Toppers in my area (Virginia Beach), but it is in limited cities around. Will def be back whenever I am in town and need a late night meal."}
{"text":"Well, If you read my Mama Ricottas review and this place came before them you know they are NOT at the top of my list Pizza wise.

The thin and Crispy was not.

Lacked Flavor.

I am glad I did get the dipping sauces, this is one pizza that definitely needs them, in fact probably why they offer them.

Lack Luster taste, Dipping Sauce, Not Crispy, Dipping Sauce. LOL

The Stars on this review should come with dipping sauce for these guys. Not uneatable but....Not Papa Johns 3 star Quality."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, hot and maybe the best pizza I've ever had.

I got a thin, light sauce, pepprone, bacon, onion with extra cheese.  Amazing!

Just in town overnight and ordered pizza delivered to the hotel."}
{"text":"Terrible pizza. Such a disappointment. Never order there again! Plus...they stuck my side of hot sauce in the pizza. Pissed me off."}
{"text":"Toppers Pizza is fast and the best pizza in Charlotte by far. I recently cheated on them with a local chain. To my dismay, it was the worst pizza I ever ate. The \"BIG\" chain called me and offered me free pizza to redeem themselves, I still haven't ordered my free pizza. For the Superbowl I ordered my pizza online three hours early, it was ready when I got there....two pizzas and toppers sticks. It's the best pizza in NC!! Worth the money any day of the week!!! You won't be disappointed no matter what you order!!! The folks that work there are so nice and the guy I usually speak to when I call has a sexy, deep voice!!"}
{"text":"Just not that good. :( But I guess it's a chain, so that'll do. Not sure how it compares to other CLT pizza places but I think next time I'll pass."}
{"text":"We were regular customers when they first opened the food was great. But we quit ordering when the food quality went down hill fast! We would order our pizza with extra sauce and they would have hardly any sauce or cheese. Toppings used to be on the pizza's quite generously but now hardly any at all. We took a chance and decided to give them one more chance after many months. We ordered a medium Taco pizza extra sauce and and a create your own with extra sauce. Both came so dry. Taco pizza had some brown lettuce on it and my other pizza had maybe 1/3 cup of cheese. I firmly believe in supporting local businesses but this is one that I will no longer waste my money on."}
{"text":"First time trying it today, the large is very small and why do pizza places insist on cutting pizza into squares. If you like card board pizza you will like this place. Big rip off."}
{"text":"Toppers makes some fantastic pizzas and they usually have some great deals.  We stopped in to get one of their phenomenal Loaded Tot-zza's that's got tons of cheese and Tater Tots!  Love it.  

Just by chance they had a 2 Large Pizzas for $9.99 deal so we got their Toppers Classic with Mushrooms, Pepperoni, and Green Peppers.  Another keeper.  Not only are the pizzas a great value, you get to choose the type of crust and they throw in a dipping sauce: Nice.

I love Pizza and Toppers is a great choice when you can make the trek to a high-end sit down Italian Pizza joint.  The only negative is I can't eat there and the waiting area isn't all that comfortable when you're waiting.  

Greta little joint and nice polite staff."}
{"text":"Toppers UNCC sucks balls. Their service is horrible and the food is downright gross. You're better off going with tried and true dominoes. Plus toppers displays annoying after annoying ad on UNCC's campus to attract new customers. I guess they need all those ads because once you eat from there, you understand why you never want to eat there again.

If you want real pizza, head over to NoDa's Mellow Mushroom where service is excellent and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Living around the corner and down the way means Toppers has their ads up in my hood. The kid saw one while the sitter was here and proclamations of adoration for the Regent Street location Topperstix ensued. I was outnumbered and my feeble attempts to say \"we have dinner here\" were lost. We have carried out from this Toppers a few times in the few weeks since starting with them, so let it be stated this grub is good!

Each pizza and stix has been delish! Thin, hand tossed, and stix style crust options. We stick to plain-ish toppings but exotic combos are here for the taking!  All counter people are friendly. They offer plates and such too. Bottled beverages are in a case for you.

The music has been late 80s metal each time. Nothing quite says \"It's the weekend!\" like getting off work on a Friday late night and walking in to the sounds of Skid Row cranked to 10! Or 11! You might raise your voice to talk to your peeps but you know what they say about if it's too loud...

Pizza times may get quoted at 10 minutes but always ready in 7.
Clean and rad comfy seats for waiting too! You can eat in gets also. Small groups up to 4 people in a party can dine in. 
Worth it if you want tasty treats fast!"}
{"text":"We waited for over an hour for our delivery. When it didn't materialize, we called the store only to find out that they had lost our order. Rather than working with us to remedy the situation, the customer service rep shrugged and said, \"Oh well.\""}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise when scrambling to find legitimate pizza near the airport hotel area!  The pizza is made up of a pretty good quality dough, and the toppings are fair in quantity!  I will suggest the cheeseburger pizza with its cheddar cheese, beef, tomatoes, and pickles!  I have to give a shoutout to the staff which is extremely helpful, patient, and super pleasant!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza delivered lightning fast! El Cubano, Mac n Cheese and chicken Tuscano are incredible!!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in university charlotte area. The buffalo chicken pizza tall boy  style is amazzzzing. Cinnastix  are a must with frosting. Wow. Long time customer and will continue as you get what you pay for here. $ yes..but worth every penny."}
{"text":"This is really good pizza!

I'd heard good things about Toppers but living in East Charlotte made it somewhat difficult to get to one on a weekday so I was glad when I finally had time to swing by one Saturday evening and pick up a couple of pizzas. They had a nice TV for me to watch while I waited on the pizzas to finish.

When I got home I finally got to see why people rave about this place, the pizzas were hot and extremely tasty. If you live near South Blvd you really need to check this place out."}
{"text":"Got my pizza delivered hot as hell in 15 minutes. Couldn't ask for anything more! A little pricey, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Living in the university area full of college kids and countless pizza nights.. This is definitely your best option for delivery. Their pizza is amazing, it's warm, just enough sauce cheese and toppings, and their crust is amazing. I also love their breadsticks. I would almost just order those all the time. They get creative with toppings so if you're in the mood to explore they have that option. They are also super fast! Like insane fast.. I've waited for other places for over an hour and Toppers delivers in about 20min on a good night. They're super friendly and helpful too. The prices are decent and they always have deals and specials going on."}
{"text":"We were up late and were craving some food.  We did not want to have the run of the mill Dominos or other national chain.  We looked on Yelp and found this place.  We called and told them to put whatever toppings they thought would taste good.  They put on pepporoni on one and sausage on the other.

The pizza came quickly and was also really good (for delivery) and was much better than any chain pizza.  Also, the price was really good for 2 pizza (like $16), and the pizzas were bigger than I was used to.  We had leftovers for lunch (nothing quite like leftover pizza - unless it's leftover chinese food).

I would order from here again and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Well this was our first time here. Very clean place, friendly staff, pizza and cheese sticks for carry out, my wife and I enjoy our meal very much can not wait to go back.   Updated few weeks later I try it again. All I can say is YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"We've had less than stellar times at this location but they always redeem themselves. 

It took us to visit charlotte in 2011 and actually try Toppers although we lived a few short miles (blocks rather) from the WORLD famous HeadQuarters in Wisconsin. 

Anywhoo, this place made fans with the peanut gallery primarily due to the \"tall boy\" offering. 

I personally think the \"hand pinched sausage\" \"thick cut pepperoni\" slices and real bacon via pieces make a world of difference. If you knew the college town that is Madison, Wisconsin - you'd understand why they have the variation of offerings as there's a lot of competition from ranch base, BBQ base, tator tot offerings, steak toppings and single slices sold NY style to deep dish Chicago style which brings me back to this location...

Service is solid and attentive. They have problems but quickly and politely address them. 
They know their specials. 
Online process makes things that much simpler and invoices are offered for record keeping or reimbursement efforts. This is useful when you have sorority or group functions and can be assessed at any time (4.5 years and rolling) if you set up an account. 

Quick reorder function from the online access 
TopperStix are like cheese bread but better."}
{"text":"Quality food - Reasonable Prices and Courteous Employees!!! What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Not worth the time. Ordered online twice and when I go to pick up my order it has not even been made yet. First time I waited but this more recent time I was feed up. The whole point to online ordering is to set a time when you want your food to be ready. Apparently they don't get that or maybe don't care. Not going to waste my time on sub par food."}
{"text":"Love this pizza! Love the chicken bacon ranch pizza.  Folks are great and the owner is awesome."}
{"text":"Worst I've ever had. Asked for delivery but they marked it as pickup. 2 hours later the manager was unapologetic and then... Who cuts their pizza in weird squares where all the good toppings are in the middle? Worst I've ever experienced!"}
{"text":"I will say first I was skeptical about trying Topper's Pizza. They weren't a chain, and they weren't Mellow Mushroom. So my boyfriend and I decided to get a pizza from there one night and we never looked back.

Their pizza is SO good! They have so many different flavors and toppings and customizations you can choose to do with your pizza. My personal favorite is their Hawaiian. Their crust is so fluffy and tasteful! I love that they have the option to have thin crust on a small pizza-- it blew my mind! Other chains say you can only have thin crust on a large pizza, so this was a nice surprise. Did I mention they have like, 10 different dipping sauces you can do with your pizza?! It's delicious my friend.

All the people who work there are awesome; they're so friendly and amazing and will do anything to ensure you get an awesome pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered to be delivered. Was told to expect within 30 mins. Waited 45 mins before I called them. Was told it should be there any minute. After an hr finally got it delivered. Pizza was cold by the time it arrived. Not worth the $$ or wait!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time tonight. My mouth is on f'ing fire. Legitimately had to get a glass of milk and stop eating fire. 

My husband likes his meaty pizza, the driver was very very nice, and easy ordering system..

However, if my hubby wouldn't have been so nice as to share his pizza I would have gone hungry tonight. My Buffalo Mac and cheese pizza was not even edible for me due to how spicy it was. I'm no stranger to spicy food. At all. But the level of heat in this pizza was absurd."}
{"text":"Three words: TATER.TOT.PIZZA. Try it, you will not be disappointed! I must say, I was thoroughly impressed with Toppers. We ordered from them
the day before thanksgiving even though my wife, the charlotte native, had never even heard of them. We checked out their menu upon recommendation from a friend and decided to take a chance on their not so typical pizza menu. Man, was it worth it! I don't even remember what the other pizza was that we ordered but my wife HAD to have that Tater Tot pizza as soon as she saw it. I was skeptical, but once we took a bite, we were in Heaven. We took some home to my in-laws and they loved it as well. Imagine crispy tots baked on top of a pizza with creamy sauce as the base and creamy sauce, bubbly cheese and herbs on top! Yum! Also, the pizza was reasonably priced  and the order was quickly executed. Thank you Toppers, we will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Wow! The breadsticks are very good, the pizza was a bit mediocre. The toppings we had were very good and fresh, however the pizza was fairly greasy. 

I would try it again, with different toppings to see if it is indeed the toppings or the way the pizza is made.

If you were going to eat here be sure to get the breadsticks. I cannot emphasize how good they were. 

Also Toddler approved."}
{"text":"Stuck at Motel 6 overnight. Called this establishment  which was one of the few open. They said they don't deliver here (even though it's just over a mile away). Their reason was that it was \"too dangerous\". Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I saw a friend on fb post about how good Toppers pizza was so I was intrigued. I went to the closest one and didn't know what to expect. 

1-They offer delivery and take out. They don't have a dining room! We heard their specials and decided to go with a large one topping pizza and a order of topper stix for $15. We also got a specialty pizza for regular price. The guy at the register was really friendly and helpful. We got our pizza and topper stix and went on our way. 

Large pizza was really good. Dough was good and not too crispy which I like. Sauce was good. Topper stix were cheesy and gooey. We got a thin crust pizza and the toppings on it were delicious!! 

Perks-Any pizza comes with a side of sauce. There are lots of options to choose from! Not sure why but when we left, the cashier gave us a coupon to use next time for 50% off! Awesome deal!!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here they said it would take 35 minutes but the pizza got here in about 15 minutes. The pizza was very hot and delicious. Will be ordering more often from here. Loved it!"}
{"text":"So let's start out with the fact that it's my wife's birthday today and she wanted pizza.  We looked at other pizza joints, but she wanted Toppers, so we ordered... 

2.5 HOURS PRIOR TO OUR FOOD SHOWING UP!  

  After an hour and a half of waiting, I finally called in.  \"Your food should be there in 20 minutes.\" said the guy on the phone.  He apologized for the wait and then mentioned that they only had one driver on duty and had received multiple calls about late food.  After a 50 minute wait, our food shows up... incorrect.  We had ordered 2 pizzas and an order of single sticks, what we got at the door was an order of sticks and supposedly MY pizza.  The driver checked his car for my wife's pizza and came back with a comp pepperoni pizza, (which wouldn't work as my wife is vegetarian), which we declined.  We opened the boxes and found that we had received the topperstix and HER pizza, (dang, should have taken that pepperoni pizza).  Oy vey, what a night.

  Long story short, this is poor management.  I don't blame the driver.  I don't blame the guys on the line.  I blame a manager who didn't realize they were in the weeds and didn't call in or reallocate resources as needed."}
{"text":"Whenever I fly, I somehow manage to have flights that put me in Charlotte at 10pm or later. By the time I get home, it's midnight and I realize I'm starving and there's no food in the house. This last time it was closer to 2am before it occurred to me my stomach was trying to digest itself. 

I'd like to thank Yelp for existing and letting me know who was open and serving food so late.
And a huge huge thank you to Toppers for being open until 3am. 

The staff were still super friendly at 3am on a Tuesday night. That's awesome, guys, truly. I already feel guilty I'm the reason you can't fully close up shop, and you're being so nice about it. 

Pizza was great. For those of you who enjoy the Pizza Hut deep dish thing, Toppers is that and better. Ingredients are generous and taste really fresh. Prices are great, as well.

I usually do the New York slice thing, but when I'm craving something else, Toppers is for sure #2 on my list for pizza in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza & service!  Highly recommend.  Great selection of unique pizza's.  Also, the chicken wings are delicious.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Saw a toppers car in my neighborhood so I googled them... The guy in the phone was patient and helpful.. Order arrived delivery in 20minutes, received free breadsticks from Halton park (?) and the delivery guy was nice and gave me a coupon! Super great experience for my first time! Food was hot and yummy! Def gonna use them again! I also called the store n talke to manager to tell him my experience he was super nice! 5 stars! Will call again!"}
{"text":"Staying in a hotel and found this place on Yelp searching for 'pizza delivery'.  Ordered the old school sausage and pep, thin.  Delivered in 20 minutes flaming hot.  Crust was super thin, with perfect amount of crunch and the meat was loaded!  Pep had great flavor and was sliced super thin so got awesomely crispy on the edges.  There was almost too much!  So much better than the big chains.  Looking forward to having it again during my second week of hotel time.  

This isn't gourmet but it's great delivery za.  Nom nom nom.  

$20 for a large including tax and delivery."}
{"text":"Would also give 0 stars if I could. Last time we ordered at 8pm. Pizza didn't arrive until after 10pm! I didn't even want it by that point! My email said it would arrive by 8:45pm. After 9:15pm, I called and was told they were running behind but that I was next on their list. Interestingly, it still took 45 minutes for our cold food to arrive. Not kidding - COLD. I contacted Toppers the following day via their website and received an email back from manager Travis Backhaus: \"The online ordering system doesn't account for how busy we are in the store. If you order a pizza at 1pm on Monday(a super slow day) or 5pm on Friday(our busiest day) it will tell you 45minutes.\" Um, okay. Why have it then? Also, I understand being busy, but over TWO HOURS is excessive. Especially without notifying the customer until they call, and then blaming factors like \"the online ordering system\". We received a 50% off coupon for our next order. Pizza was 100% cold, so I don't know.

Assuming that last experience was a one-off, I ordered again tonight. When placing an online order, you must enter your address. The system then allows you to order from the location that delivers to your address. My point is that I did not select the location to order from. About 30 minutes after the online order had been placed, we received a call saying that our food was ready, but that we'd have to come pick it up because they don't deliver to our address. Okay, 1) like I said, this location was automatically selected upon entering our address, 2) we have ordered from this location before, and 3) they don't deliver to our address but still made the food just hoping we'd be willing to come pick it up? Sounds weird. For whatever reason, I did go to pick up the food. In front of other customers, the guy said sorry, but \"people in your neighborhood ruined it for you\" and proceeded to tell me that a Dominos driver had just been robbed in my neighborhood. It was a bit embarrassing to basically have this guy trash talk my neighborhood as though I live in some rough area, but even if I DID, this entire situation was THEIR fault. 

Being busy, no longer delivering to a certain location, etc... these things I can understand and work with. It was the way these situations were handled that I found to be so unprofessional. Just apologize. DO NOT blame external factors for YOUR mistakes. I will not give this location any further business (if I make it out of this rough neighborhood without being robbed and tortured, of course)."}
{"text":"This is honestly the best pizza and cheesesticks I've ever had. I'm from out of town and got it for delivery but it blew me away! Can't wait to come back and eat it again"}
{"text":"I love toppers...fast delivery and it's always delicious. The thin crust is where it's at, for real!!! ...and weirdly enough, their wings are good. Just make sure to order them extra baked."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here for tonight's dinner. I had just driven 6 hours and couldn't bear to cook. I had some issues ordering on the website but finally got the order in. 

The had a great deal $14.99 for a large one topping pizza and an order of the toppers stix. We  went for the the half cheese, half pepperoni thin crust with the original stix. The order was scheduled to arrive at a certain time and actually arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule.  The \"pizza chauffeur\" was very kind and offered plates,  napkins and condiments with the order.

It was all very fresh and delicious and I think it is a quality alternative to Domino's. 

We will be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"This is the best of the hole-in-the-wall pizza places, akin to Dominoes and Papa Johns. In comparison, Toppers comes out on top. Their crust is always a perfect balance of soft and crisp, their cheese baked to perfection. Their toppings are quality as well. I've had several different pizza combinations from Toppers and have yet to be disappointed. Price-wise, there are surely better places to go; they're not the cheapest. They are surely the best, and you will get your money's worth!"}
{"text":"Hello Friends, 

I'm not a fan of fast food pizza \"Chain Pizza\". However, I tried this place out. Based off reviews from fellow Yelpers. Even tho a lot of negative reviews for this location is based/for the other location (university city). I placed an order for a special they had going on. 

Large 2 Topping and Cheese Sticks = about 21.00. 
+ 1.00 \" Feed the Children\" donation (hey, i'm a humanitarian)

It was pretty good.. and STILL HOT once I got home. I have NO regrets, and would order from here again. 

Open til 3am... everyday!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza.! Convenient location. The attendant was very nice :-)"}
{"text":"I ACTUALLY live 5 minutes from this location no matter how you find it on GPS. As I type this it has been an hour since I placed my order. I had an issue with my last delivery from this same location the last time I ordered and when I called to find out where my food was the manager was rude, had a nasty attitude and hung up on me. This is the last time I will order from here. I will also try as hard as I can to make sure anyone I know in the Fort Mill area within distance orders from another establishment."}
{"text":"BBQ pizza is awesome! Delivery was fast for a Saturday Night. Prices are a little high, but I would def suggest this place for good pizza and wings."}
{"text":"I have to say, flavor wise, it's pretty good. Wasn't hot upon delivery which is saddening (nothing worse than a lukewarm pizza )
Ordering was very pleasant. The person taking the order was helpful, offered a variety of dipping sauces and was courteous, not very common these days.
The delivery person was just as nice!  Offered variety  of seasoning packs which was another bonus and didn't try to charge you extra!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Their delivery was right on time. The lady on the phone was in a hurry but was still polite even though I stumbled with remembering what hotel I was in."}
{"text":"I used to love Toppers when I ordered from them repeatedly at their East Washington Avenue location. Had the misfortune of being forced to move out, and moved to Middleton. The Mineral Point Road location has repeatedly brought the pizzas only. No paper plates, crushed red pepper, grated parmesan, all of which were par for the course at the East  Washington Avenue delivery people. Just saying..."}
{"text":"I have loved all of the different pizzas we have gotten from Toppers!  So much better and FRESHER than the other \"chain\" delivery places!  (And definitely better than Digorno! LOL!)
The BBQ chicken pizza is one of our faves!
They have some unique and innovative flavors of pizzas too.
I adore the thin crust style!
Lots of different dipping sauces to choose from too, which is unique.
Delivery Drivers and counter staff have been very helpful & personable also.
Can't wait for their next location in Ballantyne to open!
Local owner is also a bonus!  #ShopLocal. #SupportLocal"}
{"text":"Hubby and I are in town for business and had been looking for some good grub we could order and not have to leave the hotel tonight. So I pulled up pizza delivery near me and Toppers was at the top of the list. I pulled up the online menu and since my hubby has a fascination with pineapple on pizza, I decided to order the Maui Topper because he'd get his pineapple and I'd get my bacon. Plus he ordered some sweet chili wings. 
Delivery was quick! The delivery driver was very friendly and polite. 
Man! That was some really good eating! The pizza was hot, which is a definite plus for delivery pizza, it was flavorful, not greasy and not doughy. The wings were tender and fell off the bone and flavorful. 
We were so upset that we didn't discover them until tonight but super thankful that our last meal in Charlotte was a really good one."}
{"text":"late night order. Delivery was on time to a hotel that I was stuck over night.  The asked if I wanted napkins, silver wear, crushed peppers, everything was a \"separate\" request.  Pizza good size, but too much oil.  The toppings were not spread but lumped into different areas of the pizza.  I don't know how its garlic sauce when it looked like pure oil.   Delivery was warm."}
{"text":"Tried their pizza for the first time tonight instead of getting my usual topperstix.

Ordered a Myza (small personal pizza) that was basically a meat lovers style pizza. Was told it would take 35-40 minutes but it only took about 20 which is great. 

While they are more expensive than the other pizza joints they definitely use some fresher ingredients, high quality chese, and put love into everything that they make. It definitely is worth the extra couple dollars."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!  My very first Toppers experience and I thought it was great!  I ordered the Tater Tot pizza that had tater tots, nacho cheese, ranch sauce, bacon and scallions (onions).  It was just me so I orderd the 9\" size and it was great!  The pizza was brought right to my hotel room door almost a full 20 minutes faster than the projected time.  Price was average to higher but in line with average pizza delivery cost.  I'd order from Toppers again without hesitation....and you should too!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We got to enjoy this pizza because another local restaurant gave poor service. We had it delivered to our hotel. They were quick, friendly and the pizza tasted great.  If we're ever back in Charlotte. We will definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"The food was good and the delivery was fast.  My food came about 15 minutes faster than the estimated time and the delivery guy was friendly. I got the raging pepperoni pizza which was slightly greasy, but tasty.  We also had the sweet chili buffalo wings which are always awesome.  One thing I would suggest -- the raging pepperoni pizza has 3 types of pepperoni on it.  One of them are the diced pepperoni and they seem to put that one on last which means they are on top of the other pepperoni and keep falling off.  I'd actually put them on either before the cheese or before the other 2 types of pepperoni so they stay on better."}
{"text":"Pizza is a yummy treat no matter what. A family friend ordered pizza for us and this was the lucky place I had the chance to try. We ordered delivery. The delivery gentleman was very pleasant and courteous. He offered us plates and all of we needed them. The pizza we ordered was the veggie and the cheese. They both were great. We also ordered the cheesy bread and this was my FAVORITE. 

Pros: Delivery Time, Food Quality, Customer Service

Cons: None"}
{"text":"Family travel in Charlotte. Topper's pizza and Topperstix were very good.  Fresh toppings, good sauce and great thin crust. Crisp but not over cooked.  Delivery was timely for made to order, fresh pizza."}
{"text":"OH NO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  THEY NO LONGER HAVE GRINDERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I was devistated to find out this unhappy fact the day I went with an order for eight
grinders.  I was told their corporate office (in some far away state) made this decision.
I was told they want to concentrate on wings & pizza.  Just like a thousand other
pizza/wing places in the world.   
Since that unhappy day we have ordered pizzas from there and the taste / quality has
gone down.   This is not a place that I would make a special trip to."}
{"text":"Fast delivery. Great thin crust pizza - were willing to do a half and half pizza. Nothing beats a greasy pizza after an evening of drinks."}
{"text":"Had them to deliver to our hotel room and the pizza was excellent! We ordered from them twice. The first time was a Mac and Cheese pizza (really good) and the second time was their \"Taco Topper\" pizza which I was really impressed with! Perfectly cooked and loaded with ingredients! It truly was like eating a taco except better! The Cinnastix were less than impressive, they were over cooked and weren't very good, Dominoes still wins hands down for their cinnastix. Overall, it was good food but horrible prices. $14.99 for a medium pizza, they need to lower their prices especially being in a state that's virtually bankrupt. They could be a little faster on their delivery too considering the hotel is only about 3 minutes from the restaurant, wait time is about 45 minutes."}
