{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, good music, friendly service, menus are big and clear, waiting chairs are comfortable. I truly love this place there bubble tea and curry are the best

*editied may 24* just as good as what I previously said but service fluctuates from \"meh\" to amazing depending on who is working

Updated after the jusfruit renovations: 
Curry is still amazing and the wasabi popcorn chicken :) new and improved menu items are supposedly coming soon, I will update after trying said items."}
{"text":"I love the bubble tea from here so tasty and so many options to choose from drinks can be pricy but it's basically a meal and a drink at the same time. You can add almost anything for an extra 50 cents which is not bad ! Wait time can be long depending on how many people are there but service is always super nice and friendly staff. I love how they have dairy free options and I enjoy going here during the night for a pick me up !"}
{"text":"We were here last weekend. We ordered for take out, and I am not kidding it took them 50 minutes to prep/cook our order. We ordered 2 BBTs, 1 bucket chicken and Japanese curry meal. There were only 2 other customers in the store, and the staff said he's working alone and still learning. How could you leave a trainee all by himself on a weekend. Anyways, I sent the company a message too, but as of now, I have not gotten a response yet."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm so glad to have Bubble Tea in Forest Lawn - it's surprising to me that I haven't been able to find any really good, fresh, quick bubble tea on \"international avenue\" until now!

We've been to Quickly a handful of times since it's opening - we live close by. They have a really decent sized food menu, a little on the pricey side I always think of this chain, but everything they make is really tasty. Lots of drink options and toppings selections. 

It looks super cute inside and the booths are really comfy. I will be back a lot, I hope they are here to stay!"}
{"text":"I've honestly never been the biggest fan of Quickly but I've decided to try it out again because they recently changed over to JusFruit and their menu looked pretty nice. My drink is the Longan Honey Milk Tea. There's nothing really special about it. The reason for my review being 2 stars is because of the lack of service at the store. When I walked in, there were a couple of people ahead of me just ordering. I looked at the drink line, there were at LEAST 6-8 drinks ahead of mine and there was only 1 girl taking orders and making the drinks. There were 3 girls working, one of them was sleeping in the very back corner yelling something at the other girls and one of the other girls were walking around, sitting around and just chilling. If these are how standards are; i will never come here again."}
