{"text":"I have eaten at the French Coffee Shop at least thirty times.  Every time it has been the same, and that is a good thing.  Yes it is true that the decor is ancient and unimpressive.  But that is not why you will be there.  It is the chicken cream crepe and the French onion soup that you must consume.  If you don't try these things, you are missing out on this hidden treasure of culinary delight; tucked away in a small corner of Cuyahoga Falls like Narnia behind-a-closet-door.  Coincidentally, this restaurant is my earliest memory of eating as child.  I remember watching in fascination as a lady pulled the long strands of cheese from the bowl of French onion soup.  You can experience that first hand even today - that cheese is amazing.  Please, no more people protesting that they find this food too rich and it's not a \"healthy\" eating choice.  That is not what this restaurant is for.  Haven't you heard of French cooking, you silly?"}
{"text":"Went on a week night for an early dinner - there were not that many tables occupied.  First off, as soon as we walked through the door we were hit with a bad odor (it smelled like a sewage/ventilation problem?).  Having been there several times before, I knew not to expect ambiance and that is one thing, but it could really stand a good cleaning (everything just looked like it would be sticky to touch, the table had something that looked like a dead bug stuck to it, walls were splattered with who knows what, and the menus were FILTHY -  I could go on....).    We started with a cup of french onion soup with a side of french bread (both delicious).  For the main dish we split the chicken crepe and chicken salad sandwich.  The sandwich was very good.  The crepe was really very, very rich.  Did not like that the crepe was folded and not stuffed, and there was too much sauce for our taste.  I have had this before but probably would not order it again.  Ordered a plain crepe with sugar.  This took FOREVER to come out.  In the meantime the waitress was nowhere to be found - she did not offer a refill on my coffee, nor did she clear the dishes.  There were only a handful of tables occupies, and I counted at least 3 females and 1 or 2 male staff, so as far as I was concerned there was no excuse.  When the dessert finally came, dirty dishes still on table, I asked for a coffee refill but never did get it.  And there was no apology for the wait.  The dessert crepe itself was so-so - soggy on the bottom from moisture.  My family said that they much prefer the crepes I make at home.  Overall, a disappointment, as I would sooo love a decent crepe place nearby."}
{"text":"I am one who takes time to review only places I absolutely love and can't live without. I feel as if people should know of the diamonds I've discovered in my time....     I have been a slave to The French Coffee Shop on Bailey Road in Akron since my friend brought me here in high school. That was maybe an owner or two ago (back when restaurants still were smoke-permitting to date me,) but the recipes never change :) I became addicted like vampire who must have cheese! (Not blood) I feel there could be a twelve-step program for anyone who goes on a dairy-free diet and can't have this stuff, poor souls...      The style of the restaurant has changed little, it isn't fancy, but it does have a nice feel. The theme in my mind is \"FRENCH COMFORT FOOD!\" I love the \"folk scenes\" painted on the walls :) But I only look at them while I wait for soup! Once food is there the view improves immensely to the sizzling plate in front of your face :) And as diverse as I like my palate to be, I've ordered the same thing since day one of falling in love... Let me tell you it takes a champ to eat all of this, even still I always want seconds immediately!   Biggest bowl of French Onion Soup they have!!! for starters.  *Extra order of french bread and butter on the side always*  Chicken Bechamel (extra sauce when I'm feeling saucy)   Fresh Strawberry Dessert Crepe (when in season)  Extra, Extra Everything! J'adore!!!!"}
{"text":"I was sad to find out today that after nearly 45 years of serving some of the best food in the Akron area the French Coffee shop has closed it's doors for the last time."}
{"text":"High rating for the food alone.   I see hit or miss on service, but we've had nice and fast service the two times we've gone.  The French onion soup is truly the best, I think it's the cheese and bread they use.   Also enjoy the sandwiches and today tried a cherry crepe which was fantastic!   I think this place has been around 30 or more years and the decor shows it.   But it's clean and the atmosphere adds to the experience.     Great spot for lunch.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty awesome food but the filth of the restaurant and the trash of the staff completely make the experience awkward and sour.  Oh and it's a little pricey for being a diner/cafe."}
{"text":"Kinda crazy. Looks like a dive, but serves up some awesome food. We have been here tons of times (even for my birthday brunch!) and love it more each time. My daughters get a savory crepe and a fruity crepe and share each time. I get the chicken crepe every time and it never disapoints! My husband usually orders that too but did try a steak sandwich once and liked it, but still had \"entree envy\". And they have great coffee too!"}
{"text":"Would have been better if we had been a regular... 5 star food with 2~3 star service.  Regulars who came in after us got their orders taken before us... but when we ordered a dessert crepe the waitress was nice enough to warn us there were 3 people ahead of us.  Coffee was strong and not bitter... refills almost came fast enough... but it was 45 degrees out and the air conditioning was on... they were trying to turn it off... they failed... it was like an ice box by the time we were served at 11:45... they only opened at 11... it really got cold fast.... so on a hot day it would be a great escape from the heat.  Cups of Onion soup came fast and hot... very well made... great layers of flavor on the sauted onions... totally worth the trip all on it's own.  Hubby's Egg / Ham / Swiss Crepe was great... fluffy eggs... just the right amount of ham... paying extra for the Bechamel was kind of a waste since mine had sooo much extra... but worth the cost.  Cream Chicken Crepe was ok... very dissapointed that the crepe was folded on the bottom of the dish and not filled... piles and piles of chicken and cheese smothered in Bechamel covered it... but really really hard to get any of the crepe and some of the chicken at the same time... tasted good... but would aske to have it filled next time. Cost of is crepe includes a soup or a salad.  Chocolatey Strawberry Crepe was one of the dessert specials of the day... Strawberry preserves seemed home made... HUGE slices of strawberry... and what is not to love about warm Nutella + any fruit!   $28 for 1 cup of soup, 1 egg crepe, 1 chicken crepe, 1 dessert Crepe, 1 coffee, 1 soda.... with half of the chicken crepe boxed to go."}
{"text":"From the outside it looks like a small (maybe scary) dinner. The indoor decor is pretty old and drab, but don't let that stop you from trying them.   The french onion soup is wonderful! Plenty of warm melted cheese and just the right balance of spices in the broth. They warn you on the menu a bowl could take 20 mins. Don't be surprised if it does take that long, but I've gotten it faster too. I think it probably depends on the orders before yours and how many soups they can do at a time. It's worth the wait.  The only crepes I have tried is the fresh strawberry. It's a decent crepe and you can't really go too wrong with slicing up strawberries and tossing on a little whipped cream.   Prices are reasonable and the service is pleasant enough. Great place for a light lunch or snack."}
{"text":"This place is somewhat of a dive, but I love the food!  I get a bowl of French onion soup and a chicken sandwich with French cheese.  Portions aren't huge so you will have room to share a desert crepe, which are freakin' awesome!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something different and the other reviews really intrigued me.  This restaurant is tucked away in a strip center in the middle of nowhere, so it can be easily missed (thank goodness for GPS!).  The decor is minimal but nice, and we were seated for lunch right away.  I had the ham, egg and cheese crepe with bechamel on the side and it was FABULOUS!  The crepe by itself was light, full of flavor, awesome ham, I just loved it.  I love bechamel, but I don't like too much at a time so ordering it on the side was just perfect as I could add just as much as I wanted (and my daughter could then share it too!)  It took us a while to make up our minds on a dessert crepe, but finally decided on a red raspberry one.  Again, really well done, just the perfect touch after our savory crepes.  Servers were right there when you needed them and were very friendly.  This is definitely somewhere that I will be returning to frequently (now that I know where it is!).  You have to try this!"}
{"text":"I come here for their cinnamon-sugar crepes!  They make everything in the kitchen, and it's always fresh and delicious!  Prices about average.  Service is either really good, or really bad.  (Hit or miss)  Soup is a favorite, and their French bread is delicious.  As far as the building, it's not the \"nicest\" of places, but bright cheery France murals on the walls help cheer up the otherwise unimpressive, old decor."}
{"text":"First, plan ahead because the French Coffee Shop is closed on Sundays and Mondays.  Be warned, because the French Coffee Shop is so easy to drive past since it is tucked in a small strip center. Having said that, it is worth the effort to locate.  You will be \"transported to France\" by the unusual decor. If you judged the restaurant by their store front and decor, you would miss a delightful culinary experience - DON\"T JUDGE THIS BOOK BY ITS COVER.   Order the French Onion Soup to start with. While you can expect to wait about 20 minutes, which is stated on the menu and the waitstaff typically states this as well, the time will pass with tremendous anticipation. Before coming here, I never liked French Onion Soup. Almost everywhere else that serves French Onion Soup prepares it so the only thing that one typically tastes (other than the onion) is SALT. This is not the case here. Upon delivery of the perfectly seasoned soup, the first thing you notice is the beautiful solid layer of \"three foot thick\"  golden melted cheese that blankets the bronzed onions and the broth soaked crouton. Insider Tip, don't forget to scrape the thin, crunchy pieces of cheese from the side of the bowl - they taste just like a cheese cracker.  Now, either get the chicken sandwich on French bread with a bechamel sauce or go for a savory or sweet (desert) crepe, you will be satisfied with your choice. The savory crepes are generally heavier than the sweet.  If you get the soup and share the sandwich or savory crepes, you won't need to eat again until the next day.   While many of the people I have dined here with love the coffee, I have always found their French Roast very strong and somewhat bitter. I am not surprised by this though, I have never found French Roast Coffee to be my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Been a regular for many years. Best French onion soup anywhere. Great French bread chicken and steak sandwiches. Good salads and coffee. Crepes are superb. Atmosphere is mediocre and the restrooms are clean but need updated. Ample parking. Excellent service. Nice friendly atmosphere."}
