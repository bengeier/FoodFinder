I wrote a FULL review and accidentally got deleted and this restaurant does NOT deserve any more of my time...   Check you bills against the menu prices (www.meshgrill.ca/dine_in.asp) - they claim this is an old menu in the store, yet their website still shows this supposed 'outdated' price menu.  EX. Mega Fest (2 FULL Chickens):  $49.99 2nd menu:  $51.99 3rd menu:  $53.99  Yet, the 2 FULL chickens don't include the wings and they keep one breast from each chicken!!!  They keep one third (1/3) of the chicken and when confronted - they claim you're lying and must have eaten it!!!  As for the FOOD:  Check the other reviews:  DRY, CHEWY chicken, COLD and raw fries!!!  Only flavour is the sauce... Even that is the same sauce in different bottles, just different level of hot...  Nothing to get excited over and the prices are outrageous...  Better to go to Galito's!!!!  DISGUSTED!!!  DISGUSTED!!!  DISGUSTED!!! UNETHICAL!!!  UNETHICAL!!! UNETHICAL!!! DISHONEST!!!  DISHONEST!!!  DISHONEST!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. We ordered the mesh chicken to share, supposed to be two whole chicken a but I only saw breasts, thighs and legs. No wings or back.  The breasts were a little on the dry side but the sauce more then made up for it in flavour. The rice was tasty but the coleslaw was okay and the fries were horrid. The dinner rolls weren't toasted enough either.   The customer service was very nice, but two issues with the store overall was 1. They did not open until 1 on Sunday. And 2. Their fountain drinks were in these dinky little glass cups... This meant that I had to drag my handicapped arse back and forth several times to refill my drink. It didn't help that the food was spicy and the fizz kept me from filling up all the way, so I had to make needless trips. Would be much happier if they provided larger cups or even pitchers that we could fill to bring back to the table."}
{"text":"Very nice and welcoming service but the food was ok. We ordered a double leg and it came with so much sauce and glazing that we couldn't try the rest of the actual peri sauces properly. The side order rice was a little undercooked as well. The lime sauce and the aged chili sauce were different and tasted good. But I don't think the peri sauces were that great"}
{"text":"I went to Mesh yesterday for a late lunch around 3 pm with my mother.  I love Nando's across the street from this place and hence I figured I'd give Mesh a shot.  I ordered a half chicken with a salad and you need to pay upfront for the food.  The difference between Nando's and Mesh is that at Mesh they disassemble the chicken and cook it in pieces vs. Nando's is a full roasted chicken.  The chicken I was served at Mesh yesterday was extremely dry.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that it's the driest chicken I've ever been served in a restaurant.  After only eating a bite I took it up to complain.  The cashier directed me to the owner of this place, a middle aged woman - she started defending her cooking and justified how she checks the temperature of the chicken before it's served - which is all irrelevant to her serving me a dry chicken.  Then she went on to further elaborate that the piece of chicken I was complaining about is how a normal chicken breast is supposed to be.  So I'm standing there with my plate and showing her how dry the chicken is and not once did she bother to actually look at what I was showing her.    I was starting to feel extremely angry and I was starving, so I gave up arguing.  I ate the dry piece of chicken since this woman didn't offer me a moist, tender piece of chicken breast and didn't offer me my money back.  I didn't enjoy my meal and I will never be going back to Mesh to eat and I will make it a point to let people know NOT to eat there.  Horrible customer service and food.  Also, the food came out within 2 minutes of ordering.  My hunch is she re-heated old chicken and served it, which is why it was super dry.  I'll post a picture of the chicken breast so you too can see how disgustingly dry it was."}
{"text":"The family has been to Mesh Peri Peri four times in total. I have to admit, the first two times were good. The last two visits were just horrible. Let me go into some detail here. The server was a caucasion female. The service received was poor to say the least. She even made some smart ass remarks which i ignored because i did not want to ruin our night out. We ordered a full chicken and a plate of ribs. The ribs were warm to the touch. When i asked about it, i was told the sauce comes out of the fridge which makes the ribs cold. So they had to shove my cooked food back in the microwave to heat it up. Secondly, they did not have butter for the rolls.  Fourth visit: Ordered a full chicken and a steak (they were out of ribs). The chicken had a weird taste to it and everyone on the table agreed that the chicken was definitely OLD. Yes old, and stale chicken that tasted bad. Secondly, the steak i ordered was to be made medium rare. Upon receiving the steak, it was rubbery and was fully cooked. I did not ask for a well done steak, i asked for medium rare. When i notified the owner, she said that she might have heard wrong. There was no suggestion of making it right...nothing!!   This tells me, they're very stingy and don't care about your hard earned money. I was planning on taking my entire extended family here, but i will never put foot back in this restaurant.   Mesh Peri-Peri - You do not deserve my hard earned money. To the readers - you want good food? You want consistency? You want fresh food? You want the owners to care and make things right if they screw up? Yes?

{"text":"I went there Monday night and ordered a mild half chicken with peri potatoes. The chicken was well cooked but there was nothing special about it, or that made me think I'd go back again. The place was quite empty except for one family that was present and around 9.20pm (they close at 10) they turned the lights off on the side I was on. The lights were turned back on but things like that should be paid more attention to.   It wasn't very expensive - about $13 or so including tax for the half chicken with 1 side. Overall a very mediocre experience."}
{"text":"if you're looking for a spicy alternative to Swiss Chalet (minus the cozy atmosphere), this is your place."}
{"text":"The food was literally repulsive. Everything was totally inedible. The Chicken was dry, the flavouring of the kabob and hamburger where as though they were attempting to fuse DOG FOOD into their taste mix. Serious gross. It could be the worst restaurant food I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"I loved this place but over time their quality of serving the food has gone down.  If you want to enjoy Portuguese grilled Chicken, well they still serve it, but in my last 2 visits the food has been cold. The fist occurrence we were too hungry and didn't bother complain as only the potatoes were a little cold.   My last visit the chicken was cold inside with hot sauce on it and the potatoes were cold (when I say cold it seemed like it was cooked and placed somewhere for quite sometime). Well this time I sent the food back as it was not eatable. We did make the server touch the chicken and potatoes to show her on how cold it was for a food which just came out from the kitchen. The chicken came out back ok but the potatoes seemed to be microwaved as the sauce was dry on the edges and I microwave a lot of stuff so it was obvious.   They have also stopped checking on the table, if the food is ok or not.  The portions are still the same and their is plenty of space in the restaurant to enjoy a decent sit in meal. They do serve Halal meat."}
{"text":"Good value place to eat.  Tried the Wednesday Special and it was ok.   I wouldn't have been happy if I paid full price for it.   I also ordered the wing appetizer and it was bbq then soaked in peri-peri.  Not bad, just ok."}
{"text":"It would appear that this place has recently taken a beating on the review front. Full disclosure, a couple of months ago the owner asked me to stop by sometime to try them out, I was frank and informed him that I would make my way there in time when I was in the area, I would not announce my visit and I would pay for meal, eat and then leave - just as any other paying customer would do. Today, as I was driving by Heartland Town Centre I remembered about Mesh and decided to pay them a visit...  In the midst of an area one would consider \"stereotypically suburban,\" with BIG - big box stores, extra value meals and yes even a Panda Express, beats the heart of independent business, and in my personal opinion it beats the loudest at Mesh Peri-Peri Grill.  Entering today for a quick/healthy lunch I was amazed at the sheer size of the space. The decor as vibrant and colourful as the food served, and speaking of the food, the menu itself was a fantastic array of selection and culinary offerings from South African, and Pakistani cuisine.  This is a family owned and operated place and the woman in charge has been featured in several articles including a feature in the Toronto Star as well as being listed as one of the top Halal spots in Toronto/GTA.  After reading some reviews, looking at some pictures and knowing I'm trying to eat healthy, I knew I had to order their grilled chicken. I went with the 1/2 chicken w/ one side, which I opted to have a fresh green salad.  Those who follow my reviews know that Portuguese/S.African style Peri-Peri chicken is a favourite of mine, so I am more than a little picky with where I put my peri-peri.  Some might compare them to Nandos, and that wouldn't be too far off, but in terms of price and value for money, Nandos couldn't hold a candle to them. First off the meal was $11.99+tax for the 1/2 chicken and side. Similar meal across the street at Nandos will run you a much prettier penny. What's more, for that price the amount of chicken you get is more than generous. I've been consistently disappointed by how boney Nandos offerings are.  The chicken is apparently marinated for 24-hours in their signature sauces before being grilled, and I can believe it. My chicken was moist, juicy, cooked through and succulent. I asked for it to be made Extra Hot and I found that to be tasty, with a good kick, but not enough to make me want to curl up into a ball, I could easily move up into their \"big 3\" heat categories.   The Salad was .. well salad. A nice array of toppings but I did feel it was a tad dressing heavy, so should management be reading, I would perhaps offer dressing on the side or lightly dress.  Meal aside, I took a quick peek around the facilities and found it to be clean, up to date and even the washrooms were well kept. As a testament to their cleanliness, one of the servers was washing the undersides of all tables during down times.  Overall, a great experience, and I would gladly return here and bring friends. The trend I'm seeing from other reviews here is there seems to be issues around potato products and cold chicken, that said while I can't comment on the potatoes, the chicken, as I mentioned, was perfectly cooked and excellent.  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday with some friends around 1230, but were surprised it opens at 1pm.   We ordered mesh chicken, which was good enough for 5 people. The portions were fair and the food was good. We got fountain drinks, where they gave us a small glass where we found ourselves making many trips for refills.  Overall, a good eat."}
{"text":"Had a chicken burger and spicy fries.  Chicken was grilled well and moist and it was decent.  Fries were not bad and the spicy salt was alright, tatsted more like cajun spice.  However, what's good about this place is that they have 10 levels of hot sauce, which is rare for chicken places.  Would I visit again?  Sure, but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"It was delicious.  I've been several times and the chicken has been juicy, tender and warm. What they offer is what mainly attracts me, their sauces as standard fare: a unique lime flavour with choice of heat degrees. The fries are kicked up with the saucy flavour, usually hot fries are in powdered spice, here it seems to be sauce based, yet maintains crispy. Extra sauces are also on your table. I also enjoyed soft drinks in fine glassware with free refills for the first time!  One thing I found odd was side bread being served in a wicker bowl that can absorb grease and crumbs."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick take out lunch as I was working in the area. Thursday special was \"Peri on the rocks\" chopped up chicken on a bed of rice. Rice was a bit funky, definitely not very fresh at all. The chicken also had a questionable flavour, I highly doubt what I ate was originally cooked today. I couldnt even tell you how it was cooked, I'd assume it was grilled but it certainly didn't taste like any grilled chicken I've had. With that being said, the Peri-peri should have added lots of flavour.  Should have, but didn't. I cant understand how they achieved this but the sauce (Hot) was all heat with no taste whatsoever. I couldnt even eat half of the meal, it just tasted like 3 days old left-overs. I threw MOST of it away. Next time I end up working in that area I will stop by again and update this review."}
{"text":"Had the chicken on the roxs. Very little chicken for the price. Rice was tasty.   Will not return because of unethical business practice.  Not being given an itemized bill when payment was made should have been the 1st tip off.  The lady had full knowledge that the price of the pitcher of soda was more than the double the posted price but chose not to mention.  When questioned about discrepancy between posted price was unapologetic and said she doesn't know why the price hasn't been updated proving that she knew the menu board has incorrect pricing. Makes you wonder what else if you not given the itemized bill, you going to be overcharged for and THEN told about increase in price.   Another reviewer a year ago mentions a similar experience.   DO YOUR MATH!!!! Insist on an itemized bill."}
{"text":"Located in the Heartand Town Centre area near Mavis/Britannia.   Interior is really well decorated and there is plenty of seating space. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich combo to-go with a delicious spicy peri peri sauce (\"hot\" gives a decent burn).    The taste and menu is very similar to Nandos and Galitos."}
{"text":"1st time in. Today I was down in the Mavis and Britannia area. I stumbled on a plaza full of over 10 restaurants. I entered each one and asked if their was a deal for new customers. No one stood up to this request, until I arrived at MESH Peri Peri Grill. The host/sales lady, said we want you to try this and will work you a 1st customer deal. I bought the 2 kabob meal with 2 sides. The worker than asked if I would like to try 1 beef and 1 chicken. I agreed. I chose rice and potatoes for a side. You may add 0.99 cents and upgrade to salad or premium items. The chicken was good with the hot sauce I added. The beef was amazing. Probably the best kabob I have eaten. The potatoes were okay, maybe requesting less sauce would help. The rice was surprisingly good. I am not a fan rice usually, but was pleased. The amount of food was more than I could eat for lunch and enjoyed every bite! I commend the worker/host(possible owner) whoever she was for making me a deal. I would of walked out, like the first ones. She was very friendly and helpful and knew the menu. I definitely will be back. Hope there is deal on bulk orders of the beef kabobs. Anyways I added a shot of my take out tray. See you soon."}
{"text":"Taste of the food is not that great. I ordered half a chicken and rice and salad. Rice wasn't warm or that tasty. Customer service was good. However food wasn't that delicious."}
{"text":"Updated review So disappointed with this place. I called in several times earlier during the week to try to make a reservation for Saturday 30th dec.  Left voice messages for a callback thinking they are busy. Friday the 29th dec the lady finally pick up. Told her to book for 5 people at 7pm as we are having guests over and they never tried their place before. And since I love this place, I said let's go there.  The lady confirmed my reservation.  To my greatest disappointment we all arrived there that day and the restaurant was closed. The restaurant's lights were switched off. But we saw people at the back in the restaurant so I called them several times. Left a voicemsg. They didn't even pick up.  I would have understand that they picked up and apologized that they are closed but no they choose to hide at the back.  Will never go back there due to this unprofessional incident.   ----- Earlier This has always been my place to go for when I have grills cravings. Only thing I didn't like is that they say they offer delivery but when you call to put a big order, they asked you to come and pick up yourself.   The chicken, the ribs, the steak are soooo tasty. It's not dry unlike some other places. You can asked if they have good ribs for the day because sometimes it's too fatty, so they will you know if you asked them.  The sides are amazing too. The coleslaw is on point just the way I love it."}
{"text":"When this place first opened up i would have given it a 5 star rating. My family and I ordered a dozen wings and they were amazingly priced, huge, and the full wing (drum & wing). Compared to Nandos they were a steal !! However, the size of the wings and the amount you receive has changed. They now split the wings (so what was once 1 wing now counts as 2) and have decreased the amount you get while keeping the same price. Another downside to this place is their \"daily specials.\" I have gone in here on numerous occasions for their daily special and they charge me regular price because it's after 4pm. What the sign doesn't disclose is that the special price is from 12-4 only... They should change the advertisement to say lunch specials because listing them as \"daily specials\" and then not honouring the price is such a scam!  I just ate lunch there today(1pm)  and I had the Wednesday special half & half. Everything was good except the lack of chicken.. Not sure if they messed up my order or forgot to put it all in but there was only a couple pieces in my rice.. Usually they lay the chicken on top of the rice but this time they blended it in the rice which leads me to believe they ran out or something .. That said I do like the taste of their rice, chicken, & salad. Their marinades & hot sauce selection are delicious. I like that the salad dressing comes on the side so you can adjust the amount && the side hot sauces to adjust the spice levels. My advice to management is to change their specials sign so it's not so deceiving and to increase the chopped chicken portions because what I received today was laughable !"}
{"text":"It's a mixed feeling...  The peri peri chicken meals are good.... well, it may not be great, but its good. The place is clean and brightly decorated. Has a welcoming look.  But about the service, we have mixed feelings. In one visit found the server very helpful and friendly. In another visit, she (a different server) was almost on her toe to leave the place. We walked in at 9:30pm, she said if we want to dine in then we \"must\" finish and leave by 10:00pm. Considering the serving time of approx 15~20 minutes, we decided to leave and head for the restaurant next-door."}
{"text":"I have to say my most recent experience at Mesh was extremely disappointing. I ordered the Chicken Sandwich with a side of rice and both were actually cold and tasted like they were made earlier. This isn't what I come to expect when I pay money for food I could've probably made better myself. Compared to my previous experiences here, this was unacceptable and I will not return again."}
{"text":"I really like this place. My friend and I have been here a few times now and the food has always been good. I usually order the half chicken, but have also tried the wings. This place is a lot better than Nandos as some of the other reviews have also mentioned. The prices are very fair, and the chicken has always been good. The half chicken comes up to 11.99 (with one side), while the quarter chicken is at 9.99. I highly recommend this spot for Portuguese style chicken if you are in the area! Heartland seems to be growing with great food spots, and this is definitely one of the better ones!"}
{"text":"HALAL  Visited this place for New Year's with family. Great food!! Their service was good but the food was amazing! We ordered so many dishes and the chicken was scarfed down in no time. Tasty, succulent, juicy chicken...price was a bit high but the food tasted amazing!  Definitely a must try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"This place is freezing no storm door no heat!!, bathroom has cold water only talk about being cheap!! Over priced food, service is very bad, the peri potatoes are horrible sticky and slimy we told them we didn't like them and they said there's nothing they can do no changing or replacing lol!! The manager said you tasted them so now they are garbage implying she can't reserve them. OMG she would have sold my rejected food to someone else!!! This is not at real piri piri restaurant it's a Pakistani restaurant beware of fakes! Don't waste your money here. Manager is the owners sister she is a real rude lady bad attitude wouldn't replace our potatoes on a 109$ order ?? That would have cost her less than a dollar??? Not smart I've already stopped several friends from going there now you all !!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I usually end up getting the same thing. Chicken kabobs with peri fries. I personally like this place more than Nandos. The meat was so juicy and tender and there's a few type of sauces you can choose from. You can also choose your sauce spice level.   I like the one above lemon herb? Just a little more spice to it. The fries could be a little more crisper but I like the peri seasoning they use to it. I get super full from the whole dish. I never finish the fries.   Seating area is huge. Ample space available and located in the heart of heartland. Don't be fooled by the level of slow traffic they get, the chicken here is good! Have yet to try the beef though.. maybe next time."}
{"text":"I usually go to Nandos, but saw this place and thought I'd check it out.  My wife had the chicken on the rox and I had the half chicken, we both ordered hot.  There's no way the food was hot, the chicken on the rox was mediocre, it had no taste, not even the small amount of chicken it comes with.  The half chicken came with McCain fries and a good portion of chicken.  The chicken was okay, but wasn't great, it seems their version of hot is whAt Nandos serves as mild, even the sauces on the table added little flavour.  Definitely not worth the money"}
{"text":"Went there the first time. Upon entering with my wife, we saw that it was a nice big place. When we got to the counter, we were met with a very non welcoming style. I think it looked like lady was the owner.  When I ordered a half chicken and a mini burger, she refused to serve us the mini burger Coz she said it was only for children 10 years or younger. I told her that we wanted the mini burger Coz my wife wasn't much hungry plus she likes to order small Portions . But the lady refused lying that the system won't accept the order. I mean how would the system know the age of the person ordering. Plus shouldn't it be a choice of the customer to order whatever he/she wants to order on the menu, irrespective of her age. Not sure why this age discrimination. We just walked out of the restaurant without eating due to her bad attitude."}
