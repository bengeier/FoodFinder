{"text":"Often closed,  out of stock indie butcher that's more focused on having beer with his buds on his own patio than serve his customers.  I keep giving this place more chances only to be let down with either what I want not being in stock or the raw product just being average and highly overpriced.  I can name at least 3 better butchers in a 10km radius."}
{"text":"Best. Place. Ever.

I'm not a meat connoisseur, in fact, I rarely eat meat at all. For the most part, I find the flavour of meat to be a little lacking... but that was until I tasted the meats served up at the Village Butcher. Wow!

Everything is fresh, succulent and simply amazing. The guys behind the counter know their meats. On top of the huge array of butcher meats, you can choose form a selection of world cheeses, pastries, seafood, sauces, you name it! One of my favourites is their steak & mushroom pie... it's packed full with some of the best cuts of steak, a deliciously seasoned filling and a selection of mushrooms. One time, my husband and I went to purchase a couple, only to discover they'd sold out! I was heartbroken! The owner, asked if we had 5 minutes to spare, which we did, and made one up fresh while we waited. You don't get that kind of service nowadays!

I highly recommend this place--it's chocked full of character, characters and the best selection of meats probably anywhere on the west-end of the city. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Okay - this is to get your attention: The Village Butcher and Around the Corner have closed - ie. no longer there on 6th Street or anywhere else from what I can see.  Too bad - we stopped going to the butcher shop because Mark seemed to abandon it in favour of the restaurant - so maybe we weren't the only ones."}
{"text":"Brilliant. This place is legitimate. I went in today to do my holiday shopping, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had everything I needed (even somewhat obscure stuff like bones for marrow). 

The quality of meat is exceptionally high, especially their Berkshire pork. The man (I assume the manager, as he said he would be working XMas day!) who helped us was very knowledgeable, friendly, and efficient. He cut and cleaned a beautiful bone-in pork roast for us on the spot, all the while describing where and how the pork had been raised. 

Special orders are available if you call in advance, but as I said, they had a great selection when I went. Everything from ground beef, to fresh chorizo, to duck rillet. 

The shop was clean and well stocked with the accoutrements you expect from a fine dining shop I.E. Preserves, sauces, and the like. Also, they totally have an arcade cabinet! Bubble Bobble while you wait. I love it.
 
Of course, you pay a premium for a premium cut of meat, but the prices seemed very reasonable. I will definitely make this my go-to from now on. I was thoroughly impressed by the caliber of meat and helpfulness of the staff. I really think it's worth making an extra stop to get your meat here, rather than the supermarket."}
{"text":"A great store with excellent selection of high quality goods. Best items include: fresh meat pies (the best we've ever had), bison burgers, fresh seafood, and fair trade coffee from Alternative Grounds.
But that's not the best part! Excellent, friendly service from the guys behind the counter is what keeps customers coming back over and over."}
{"text":"Terrific local spot.
Great owner, helpful and friendly.
Amazing smells from the outdoor BBQ, an appreciated scent in the neighborhood!
Owner takes off a good 3 months or so a year, so check before you make the trek... He's smart; leaves during winter, especially this &(*in winter!!"}
