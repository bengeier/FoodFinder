{"text":"Really enjoyed this restaurant. The concept is novel and the quality of the meat is up to that of Ruth Chris and other high end chains, but the difference is you cook your own steak to your liking - so much fun and we ate every bite. The owners and their staff could not have been more friendly and appreciative that you entered their establishment.  I finished my meal with a perfect creme brûlée and the best irish coffee I've had in a long time while my husband had the chocolate cake. We also thought the prices were fair. This restaurant has a european flair and an atmosphere to match.  We will be back and bringing friends with us next time!"}
{"text":"Great food/ unique experience. Would definitely recommend for all looking to try something new in lkn. Great service and food!"}
{"text":"This was not a good experience. I ordered the mahi mahi, which was the catch of the day. It smelled so bad (not fresh) we immediately sent it back. We also had a small salad with grilled shrimp and it was not fresh and under cooked, which went back as well. We also had two filets that were OK, but the demi glacé suggested to go with it was not good and seemed like it was prepared from a powdemix to us. We had babies with us and asked if the meals could be cooked in the kitchen instead of on these hot stones for safety reasons. They would not accommodate our request. I think this concept may work in more of vacation setting, but I want my food prepared for me, that is why I go out to eat. We won't go back."}
{"text":"It was ok, my hubby ordered the mussels and was very disapointed as they were almost non-existent--very small. I had the ahi tuna which was delicious. I think the side dishes are way too costly, $7.00 for a side of vegetables? unless the prices change, its just to expensive for me, particularly for the value. Cute place, super cute and nice waitress"}
{"text":"I booked a table for 5 today for Mother's Day. When we arrived, there were maybe 3 other tables filled. Definitely not busy. We all ordered (3 soups and salads, fettuccine, sausage plate and cheese platter to start).  After an hour of no food and no explanation, we finally received our cheese platter. It was a joke. Mediocre at best and served with soft store bought bread. There was no reason for that to take so long. We then waited and waited and waited some more for our entrees. Meanwhile, the owmer was walking around aimlessly, not at all concerned that our table had been sitting for more than an hour with no food.  Our waitress had told us we were next and our food was being plated numerous times. Finally, we just decided to ask for our check. The owner then comes to our table assuring us it will be 5 more minutes. We ended up leaving with no food. So, I can't comment on the quality of the food (althhough the table behind us was not pleased with their food or service either).  Definitely do not recommend."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Hot Stone Grill.  My boyfriend on the other did not dislike it but didn't love it.  My expectations may have been lowered considering all of the reviews I'd read previously.    His thoughts about it are that it's about the experience, which it is, which I enjoyed.  He didn't feel as though the prices should be as high as they were due to the location (in a strip mall) and the amount of food received wasn't a lot for the price.  He also thinks it's a little overpriced considering you are cooking your own food! :-)   With the hot stone entrée options you will receive one side. (most of the options here are not the sides mentioned on the main menu).  The meat comes out basically raw, a little cooked on both sides.  If you need assistance, someone will come over and give you tips on what to do.  He had lamb with mashed potatoes and I had filet mignon with broccoli.  We ordered a shareable macaroni and cheese.  The taste and season of the meat was good.  They also give you options of sauces for dipping, I preferred mine without.  The broccoli was pretty basic, not much seasoning applied, which is ok by me.  The macaroni was good.    Thankfully we had a Living Social deal so that helped out as well with the price.     I can agree to all of the cons my boyfriend pointed out.  While Hot Stone Grill definitely wouldn't become a regular go to dinner location, I enjoyed it and wouldn't mind going again."}
{"text":"Wow! Hot Stone Grill gets a 5 star rating... My husband and I stopped in for wine & apps and were amazed by the Baked Asparagus & prosciutto w/ Mornay sauce and the fabulous Shrimp Cocktail! The staff was truly professional and very welcoming and the owners were wonderful ! We cannot wait to go back... We highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Our first trip here and it was outstanding. The filet was one of the best I've had (and I've had a lot). Service was great and the atmosphere was comfortable. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Awful! They were out if nearly everything. If you are accustomed to a high end restaurant ala Morton's or DelFriscos you will be sorely disappointed. The entire evening was weird, the food simply topped if off!"}
{"text":"For anybody seeking a new dining experience, try the Hot Stone Grill. It has everything from a great menu, an accommodating owner and friendly staff. For a business lunch with your best customer or an enjoyable evening with your spouse, Hot Stone Grill is the place to go.  The dining experience at Hot Stone Grill is \"Out of the Box\".  Go and be surprised.  Christine & Martin Eichenberger"}
{"text":"a little european culture in huntersville. the three owners come from England, Germany and France.  they have entrees on the menu that are the traditional dishes from all over europe.  but the specialty is the hot stone entrees.  we had a nice cut of lamb and swordfish.  they are seasoned and put on a volcanic slab of stone that has been heated for some 10 hours apparently.  the stone retains the heat (around 400 degrees) for about an hour.  but you don't need to let the meat cook for that long.    you let the meat cook for as long as you like.  sometimes you can cut off a smaller piece and cook that faster to eat a bit sooner.  the place is small and cozy.  the nice long slab of marble that is the bar has high end wine and liquor ... saturday night was busy enough that we, without a reservation, had to eat at the bar.  being just 7 seven weeks into the restaurant's existence, the kitchen had the usual hiccups but nothing that the wine didn't fix.   the food was excellent, the scallop appetizer and the mesclan salad were stellar. the swordfish and lamb were exceptional. and the dessert was a standout dish of poundcake as well.  not that it was the best dessert or appetizer or entree.  i was just there once so i can't say if the other entrees, meats or desserts were better but i can say that you couldn't go wrong with the dishes that we had.  the owners seemed like good people as well. they were all there and we had a nice chat with the english gentlemen by the bar and the french lady behind the bar.   all in all, i'll be back and i hope to taste a good number of the entrees and meats on the hot stone.  the stones definitely make for a different experience which is well worth the time and energy to get down there and give it a try."}
{"text":"Bad bad bad idea! Out of calamari, out Malbec, out of chocolate cake, $13 bourbon, I guess they were out if bacon for my kinda of a wedge salad that had hidden valley ranch dressing as well.. Hmmm I would advise a better meal at Waffle House!"}
{"text":"Take the following with a grain of Himalayan salt, since my dining experience fell on an extremely crowded Valentine's Day evening.  The Hot Stoners were clearly more accustomed to a slower pace, and I don't think that pace will be picking up anytime soon.  Ensconced in a charming Cornelius strip mall, my wife and I were escorted to a decent table and introduced to our server.  As my wife put it, \"he was really good looking, until he opened his mouth.\" There were two Reislings on the Valentine's menu, and my wife asked what the difference was, only to be told that one was \"really smooth\", while he was more of a beer guy who hadn't tried the other.  Thanks, brah.  We ordered the food and settled in for a long winter's pause.  While waiting, a flamenco style guitarist started playing and set a great vibe.  Unfortunately, his second number was an extended rendition of The Godfather waltz: not exactly smoochy smooch material.  While the Corleones waltzed on, we were distracted by the waiter's assistant, who timidly hovered next to the table before asking if I wanted more water in my empty water glass.  Why yes, Garcon!  A few minutes later he interrupted our conversation with another incisive comment: \"Are you finished with this?\"  I glanced down at the completely empty bread basket and praised his perspicacity.  He next delivered our appetizer, then took it away, only to bring it back a few minutes later.  We settled in and actually had a grand time watching him nervously wander from table to table carrying people's \"hot stone\" entrees as they sizzled toward over-done.    This pastime lost its allure when my hot stone steak arrived and our suave server informed us that my wife's Ahi tuna salad was accidentally served on a hot stone, but the kitchen was rapidly transforming it into the salad she had ordered.  A few minutes later, her salad arrived with a decidedly over-cooked hunk of tuna quite reminiscent of StarKist.  I choked down the gristly, overpriced ribeye not quite as \"aged to perfection\" as the menu promised, while she ordered another \"smooth wine\" to accompany her tunafish salad.  We hurried off to the Fresh Market for a decent desert and bottle of wine.  Check please, Garcon!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars - Somewhere between meh and ok... The quality of the filet is the only thing that gets this review rounded up to three stars. Read on for more details.  We decided to catch an early dinner (after skipping breakfast and lunch) on Saturday. I made easy reservations on Open Table for 5pm. When we pulled up, both of us were pretty surprised by the exterior. The restaurant was in a newer looking strip mall, next to a nail salon. Not the swanky digs that I was expecting. We walked inside to an empty restaurant, as they had just opened. The host, who turned out to be our waiter, asked us if we had reservations. Yes, we did. We were seated at a small two top by the wall. I guess they couldn't spare a more roomy table. The interior of the restaurant felt like they wanted to make it look and feel upscale on a budget.   So, Hot Stone Grill's schtick is kind of like a fondue restaurants. Switch out the hot pot for a 600 degree volcanic stone. Given this description, you would figure that the food would come out raw and you would get to cook it. Well, that wasn't quite true. The filet came seared on both sides, sitting on the stone. The shrimp and scallops came cooked but sitting on the stone cooking further. I was hoping to get the ahi tuna but they didn't have any. The fish selection was salmon and mahi mahi. But after reading the negative review about the quality of the fish, I decided on shrimp and scallops instead. In hindsight, I wish I had just ordered a filet.   The quality of the filet was excellent, and it was kitschy fun to be able to sear the meat on the stone before eating it. We like our meat rare so we pushed the meat off the stone and threw it back on just before eating. I'm not sure what the big hoopla is over their demi glace. It was pretty bland. I preferred the peppercorn sauce, which had much more flavor. The sauces that came out with the seafood were both ok. The seafood was very bland, only having been seasoned by salt. The sides were soooo boring. The mashed potatoes seemed like those out of a box. The veggies of the day were overcooked, underseasoned, sauteed yellow bell pepper strips, onions, and zucchini. Very disappointing for a place that charges $30 per plate. I was also surprised that they didn't offer a bread basket or something. I feel like that is really par for the course.    Our waiter was ok, just really awkward. He was trying way too hard. I mean who tells a customer to come up to look at the beer selection... shouldn't you have a list or something. He hovered and tried to make awkward conversation.  Overall, we won't be returning. While the filet was very good, there are much better places to visit for the price."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Come here if you want a different, unique dining experience with high quality food and service.  The owner was on site when we ate dinner here for the first time last night.  You can tell he really cares about his customers with his attention to detail.  (Super nice guy to boot!)  Our server was Sarah and she was great as well.  I had the surf and turf (filet and shrimp) and my girlfriend had the 6oz filet.  Both were perfectly seasoned, and the demi-glaze sauce was out of this world good.  I even asked if they sold the sauce separately... it was probably the best glaze for a steak I've ever had.  Since the stone stays hot for two hours, every bite of filet is hot and cooked perfectly!  You can't go wrong here!  Great place for date night!  We will definitely be coming back.    I read a few reviews before this one and was surprised by the comments on the prices.  Come on, people... clear the moth balls out of your wallet already.  The prices are reasonable given the quality of food.  Get over here and have you some filet with that demi-glaze and if you don't like it, I'LL PAY for your dinner.  (ok, I won't really pay for your dinner, but you won't be disappointed!)"}
{"text":"Booked dinner at Hot Stone Grill through Open Table, where the reviews were mostly positive.    I started with a Bloody Caesar (a Bloody Mary with Clamato instead of tomato juice) and found it to be entirely lacking in character -- it didn't appear to have any hot sauce or Worcestershire sauce in it at all.    We ordered the cheese plate and a Caesar salad for starters.  The cheese plate was a mediocre Brie, a mediocre crumbled blue cheese, a mediocre Gouda, and a passable smoked cheddar.  The plate was garnished with very strongly pickled onions, which only overpowered the cheeses and did nothing to accentuate them.  The salad featured a grilled Romaine -- in practice, it was less 'grilled' and more 'hot & wilted'.  At best, the salad was a failed experiment.  The dressing was pleasant enough but the poor, abused lettuce made it a chore to eat through.  We considered ordering one of their 'hot stone' entrees, which are delivered to the table sitting on a 400F hot stone; however, while this sounds like fun, careful consideration led us to dismiss the idea.  I can't imagine any reason that I would want my steak to pass from rare clear to well-done while I'm eating it.  Perhaps we were mistaken.  We ordered the seafood paella for two, having been assured that it was excellent.  Instead, it could charitably be described as bland.  The rice was plain -- not a trace of saffron to be found -- and, while there were quite a few mussels, there were only traces of other seafood to be found in the dish.  (I didn't see any clams at all, though the menu assures me they were supposed to be there.)  Overall, the dish was far too expensive for the few delights that it offered."}
{"text":"Went for a wine tasting. The waiter obviously didn't understand what a \"tasting\" was. He poured too much wine (not complaining) and didn't explain the wines. Cheese and crackers were at the bar, which we had to go and get and bring back to the table. We enjoyed the wine, but then ordered dinner and it went downhill from there. We ordered Chicken Cordon Bleu and Ahi Tuna on a lava rock. The Chicken was breaded with no taste, no cheese and the ham was used as a garnish. The Ahi Tuna was bloody and had to be turned on the rock several times to be editable. They forgot the side dish of blue cheese mashed potatoes and then when it arrived, it was like soup and had no flavor.  We may go back for a wine tasting because the music was great and we obviously got a lot for our money! But for dinner, no."}
{"text":"New place in the neighborhood. Unique concept, cooking your own food on a hot stone. Nice that they have opentable. The scallops are awesome, you don't need to cook it for too long. The sauce they recommend goes well with the seafood. I would like to see fresher, local cooked (not commercially purchased) desserts. So far so good. They do have homemade butter pound cake."}
{"text":"Just down the road from the Birkdale Mall area, this cozy restaurants is excellent. I stumbled upon this restaurant because I was living at the Residence Inn just around the corner.  I had their steak on a Hot Stone and it was great. Big beefy taste , served on a hot stone, grilled fresh before your eyes. Fresh and high quality beef, that is oooo so tender.  Will be back for sure.. It's been a while since I had steak so good."}
{"text":"I was visiting NC for a Wedding and Yelped my iphone for a Healthy Resturant in the Cornelius area.  Hot Stone Grill as a cool outside patio, great for watching the Sunset, while sipping on a nice Glass of Wine and also a cool looking indoor Bar. The food is superb and they also can cater to all. ( I am a Vegetarian and they created a AMAZING personal dish for me) A great atmosphere for ALL occasions, the owner Nazira was a breath of fresh air, very welcoming and had a great knowledge of Wine and food parings, maybe because she is from France?  I love this place, if I lived in the area, i would be there every night!"}
{"text":"Go eat here! You won't be disappointed. If you are, you were looking for a disappointment. The lava rocks, friendly staff and sincere ownership are only additions to the tasty cuisine."}
{"text":"Ever since Hot Stone Grill opened up in the ex-Lowes shopping center in Cornelius I've been intrigued by what they offered. It's like the Melting Pot...who doesn't like the idea of cooking a bunch of fresh raw meat in front of you at your table? But Hot Stone does away with the community pot of broth and instead brings you your own personal 600 degree lava stone to cook your vittles on. It's a great concept that is executed perfectly and makes for a unique dining experience.  Let me start of by saying that Hot Stone Grill is pricey...we didn't go until we had a Groupon-esque deal AND we were celebrating a special occasion (our anniversary.) We walked in at 6:30 on a Friday night and found the place to be dead, though by the time we left at around 8:00 it was pretty hoppin'. The interior is quaint and charming, and has a fancy, intimate feel to it. The hostess greeted and seated us right away and our server was very knowledgeable. I was a bit disappointed in the wine selection, as they only offered two reds and two whites by the glass ($8 each), though they did have more to choose from by the bottle.   For an appetizer we ordered the cheese plate ($12) which had four different cheeses, some fresh fruit and hot bread. The cheeses were a decent selection, with a smokey gouda, a bacon-infused cheddar, a brie wedge and some crumbled bleu. I was a huge fan of the cheddar and gouda, and the missus really enjoyed the bleu. The brie in particular went well with the strawberries and blueberries that accompanied the plate.  Then came dinner. While there are about eight European-influenced prepared dishes on the menu, you don't come to Hot Stone Grill for fettucini alfredo or beef bourgignon...you come for the actual hot stone entrees! If you come here and don't do the hot stones then you're missing the point of coming here!!! There is a selection of meats to choose from, and they bring the meat out to you on your own personal stone along with the side veggie of your choice. The meat is mostly raw, but they do pop it on the lava stone to sear it for visual and audio effect (plus it just smells amazing too!)   I chose the lamb tenderloin ($30) and was not disappointed. The server advised us to remove the whole meat from the stone, and to then cut off and cook each bite individually. This ended up being sound advice as each bite was cooked in a matter of thirty seconds and was done to perfection. To try and cook the entire hunk of meat at once, and then eat the whole thing after, could not compare to the quality you get when cooking each bite pretty much to order based on your own personal preference. The lava rock is coated in Himalayan salt and getting that little bit of salt with each bite was amazing. There are several dipping sauces to choose from when ordering your meat and the server will be more than willing to advise you on the chef's suggested pairing. With the lamb the server had recommended the demiglaze and it was a rockstar choice, as it complimented each lamby bite so well. My lamb was nothing short of tastetacular!  The missus went the sea route and ordered the ahi tuna ($32.) The tuna consisted of two long slabs that she was able to cook to that perfectly seared rare. The fish was extremely fresh and tasty. The server recommended a lemon citrus sauce that also complimented the tuna very well. We both ordered the mashed potatoes as sides, and while they were bland at first, they grew on us as we ate more. They were not overly buttery or salty, but we couldn't stop eating them.   The Hot Stone Grill offers a great dining experience that is near impossible to find anywhere else in the area. Cooking your own meal on a hot stone is not just a novelty as it is a really satisfying experience, and not just some lame gimmick. It is a bit pricey but totally worth it if you want to celebrate or just go all out and treat yourselves. The next time we want to splurge we will definitely be having Hot Stone Grill at the forefront of our minds."}
