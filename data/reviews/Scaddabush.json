{"text":"This is my second time at scaddabush. I remember the first time was a good experience. This time....was also good! Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. Food was yummy as well. We ordered the carbonara pasta, a pizza, and a few sides. The carbonara was pretty good. There was an egg on top, but it didn't feel like there was egg in the sauce (and thus I felt it was not creamy enough). Pizza was alright. The side dishes were good except for the rosemary fries. I thought that there could've been more rosemary flavour to it. (Note: after we finished the fries, we then realized that the seasonings were all on the bottom of the bowl the fries came with!! So, hint: toss your fries before you devour!). We also had one of the salads (the Tuscan salad?) and it was very flavourful. 
All in all, dinner at Scaddabush was a good experience! The setting was nice and seating was comfortable. One small thing I would've liked: complimentary bread!! ;)"}
{"text":"Quick lunch time service. Got the pesto fettuccine with chicken. The pasta was well cooked and sauced. Their tiramisu was also very good."}
{"text":"The pasta tastes notably fresh, the service is good and the setting just right. The meatball was a tad bit on the salty side but big and bold. Simply put, Scaddabush has excellent pasta and good flavours."}
{"text":"Been here over an hour and a half. No main course has been served yet. Empty drinks and hungry stomaches. 

Terrible service. Waiter nowhere to be found. 

Being in the hospitality industry, this is extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic meal here! I had heard good things and wasn't disappointed. I liked that my friend and I had a very nice leisurely dinner and never felt rushed. The Mozzarella ball is a MUST. Super delicious and great for sharing. Friend had pizza that I thought tasted great. My pasta was a good serving so I was able to take a bunch home. It wasn't the BEST homemade pasta I've ever had, but it was close. One complaint is that most of the sauces are tomato based. Would be nice to have some oil and garlic or pesto options too. We ordered the Zeppolle for dessert and I found them a bit dense, but I think that's just preference."}
{"text":"The wait staff were friendly. The food portions were generous and the food itself was fresh and lively. It wasn't overly noisy although I suspect it might be on a busy night."}
{"text":"Went there last week for dinner.  Decor looks the same as old Alice fazoolis.  Ordered calamari to start,  it was alright,  seemed to be missing something.  The bacon and egg pizza after was really delicious though, tad spicy.  Overall experience was great,  service seemed a bit slow a food took some time nothing too crazy."}
{"text":"The appetizers are awesome. The main course is good, but I prefer to eat appetizer. 
I'm fan of the environment there. U should go and try it"}
{"text":"Worst service in Greater Toronto! I booked a reservation for 4 people. We walked in and I literally stood in front of the hostess for 10 minutes before being greeted... I provided my name and reservation and was told we'll be looked after soon and then the hostess pulls a Houdini. They were probably overbooked but didn't care to inform us of the situation, hence making us feel ignored. 15 minutes later, we were seated. The server came and we inquired about bottled wines. He provided a couple tasters but we didn't like them so we asked for a recommendation. 20 minutes passed and we flagged him down while serving another table. He looked at us, then looked away. So we're 45 minutes in, and have yet to even be served water, we did what any logical patrons did... Get up and leave. You have been warned"}
{"text":"We were here for lunch on a Saturday and had a better experience than our previous visit. The restaurant wasn't busy so we received a much more attentive service from our server. The food was also delivered much faster than last time. 

We ordered: 
- calamari fritti: The calamari was lightly battered so it didn't feel too heavy
- the butcher pizza: Crust was a little soggy this time and the toppings were too salty for my liking
- baked carbonara: Delicious! So creamy once you break the runny yolk. 
- chocolate toffee jar cake: So indulgent but this is so good. 

Gave Scaddabush another shot and it fared better than last time. It's a good place to eat while catching up with your friends."}
{"text":"Okay the pros: the place is quite nice- beautiful decor with dim lighting. The ambience is quite nice as well. 

The cons: the service is pretty terrible. We had a hard time finding our waitress and she only came by twice- once to take our orders and second for the bill. We didn't have water at one point in the evening and there was no one around to even get water for us. Instead, I noticed all the servers gathered at the back chatting. 

The cons: the food was not great. The prices were moderate ranging from $15-$30. We tried the calamari, arrabiata pasta, zucca pasta and chicken parmesan sandwiches. The pastas were bland- fresh parmesan or pepper was not offered to us by our server. The calamari and  chicken parm were better and had more flavour.

Overall, I give this place 2/5 mostly because the service was not great."}
{"text":"Nice interior,but the food is really not authentic,and the food quality is not steady also,will come back for drinks but not food"}
{"text":"Went here last night. Everything was excellent. We orders table dishes and a bunch of apps for a party of 6. Waiter was quick and didn't miss a beat. Everything from the meals, the wine, to the service was great!!! Would definitely go again to try the rest of the menu. The place is perfect for a nice relaxing evening with friends or your family. Even for a drink with friends at the bar. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our lunch at he Scarborough location so much we tried dinner here. Not as good on the table service front, but we did watch the mozzarella pull and she was very nice. She walked us thru all the differ t processes and recipes she was doing. It was a nice touch while we waited. 

I had the Capri. Very nice, not overly fishy or tough."}
{"text":"Food: the best food ever! I ordered the spinach and artichoke dip which is so good and it comes with this really crispy bread, I recommend that! And then I ordered a pizza but I must warn you, it's filling especially when you've had an appetizer so you should split it! The Rosemary garlic fries are delicious! Very flavorful. For dessert I had the cheesecake which was so unique and probably the second best cheesecake I've ever had. THE FOOD IS WORTH EVERYTHING!!!!!

Service: now I've been to scaddabush a few times and the waiters and waitresses are amazing but this time I had a rather rude waiter. He consistently forgot stuff I ordered and had an attitude as well which sucked. Nonetheless, the food was great so I got over it!"}
{"text":"Every review mentions Fresh Mozzarella and I was saddened that the menu said daily 5-11pm and we went for lunch. So glad I asked for \"leftover\" Mozzarella and they actually had them available .... fresh ones. Had naked and sweet and salty and it was really good. Also had spaghetti and meatball and Caesar salad. Definitely need to go back and try other menu items."}
{"text":"Recently went to lunch with co-workers for Xmas lunch and the place was very nicely renovated, high ceilings, nice decor and overall a beautiful place.  

I think this location used to be Alice Fazooli's and in some ways, it's the same and different.  One thing I noticed was the menu writer is very talented.  Everything sounds wonderful and hand made with fresh ingredients, the way nana used to make it.  We ordered some appetizers to share and this is why I say it's the same and different at the same time.  If you had blind folded me and asked me if there was any difference, I wouldn't be able to tell you.  I ordered the pepperoni pizza and it came out on this really cool plate with built in cutter but I found it to be greasy and too heavy with too much pepperoni.  I never thought I would ever complain about a restaurant giving too much pepperoni but it didn't work for me.   The things ordered by my co-workers again could have came out of another chain \"Italian\" restaurant.  

For dessert, I thought I'd order chocolate gelato and I think this is the first time that I have ever gotten ice cream that looks like it has been sitting in the freezer too long when it starts to have that syrupy, sort of melted texture.  

So in the end, Scaddabush is a chain restaurant with a talented interior decorator and menu writer (maybe it's the same person) with a cool sounding Italian name.  I've walked by many times and my expectations were high but have to say I felt a little bit let down."}
{"text":"Came here for Christmas eve lunch, made a reservation through open table. Not too many people inside when we got seated. We asked our server what was good on the menu, she basically said everything which wasn't helpful so I went with the shrimp pasta with herbs and lemon, really good! My date went with the stuffed meatball, he said it was good too! 

We wanted to get a bottle of wine too she gave us a suggestion and we went with it, it was okay.  We also got dessert, went with gelato but it was mediocre. 

The service was horrible, she didn't bring us our food or refill our wine. I don't even know where she was because it was not that busy. For joining the social club I got $10 off so when I gave it to her she had an attitude with me. My date tipped her for the whole meal and when it was my turn to pay, I added to her tip.

As we were walking out she gives me my tip in my hand and says \"you clearly need this more than I do\". So she basically waited there to do that. If she thought I was going to tip her another 10-15% she's delusional. I wish I remembered the name of our server, but I don't know her name."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. They have awesome meatballs and pizza. Their spaghetti was not outstanding though; it was a tiny bit undercooked. Our waiter was great."}
{"text":"Would definitely recommend this place for a friend group to a family dinner!! The hosts and waiters were very friendly and got us a table very quickly. (It was a busy Sunday night and a Leafs game was on as well). The tables and chairs were very nice and we quickly got our order in. I enjoyed how the pasta came with three different sizes for three do occasions. The food came very fast and was super yummy! Overall would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Servers are very kind and they have a pretty decent variation in their menu. I had the bacon and egg pizza and it was unlike any pizza I have tried before, and it was pretty good. I will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Great fresh pasta... otherwise pretty standard Italian fare."}
{"text":"Overall, our party of four was very disappointed with the food.  We shared three appetizers to start - the spinach dip (the dip was good, the oily bread sticks were awful), the chicken bites (very disappointing), and the prosciutto mozzarella app with fig jam (this was delicious and the only reason I'd even consider going back).  

I also ordered the white wine sangria which was wayyy too sweet.  In all honesty, it tasted like juice.  I couldn't drink it. 

My main was the spaghetti and meatball. The sauce seriously tasted like a jar of Ragu- awful. Meatball was decent. The other members in our party had the penne bolognese (no good), the pesto, chicken pasta (not bad), and a pizza (also not good).

We had wanted the calamari instead of the chicken bites but they were sold out. Our reservation was at 9:15 pm on a Saturday. When it was time for dessert we had wanted the jar cake - they were all out. We asked for tiramisu - our waitress came back and told us they were out of that too. We settled for the zeppole (sp?) with Nutella sauce - umm they were dense, fried dough balls rolled in sugar - worthless dessert.

Our server was great, however. 

Great service and great mozzarella app - hence the two stars. Other than that, nothing special at all.  They really should make some changes.  The food needs work, and they need to not keep running out of menu items so early in the night. I'd be hesitant to go back."}
{"text":"The food is not authentic Italian even though they claim to make fresh pasta. pasta needs salt and the steak was also lacking seasoning. I've been 3 times and every time I'm not impressed by the food especially when they charge prices like Terroni. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Had the stuffed meatballs, it was a really good dish. No complaints on the food or the actual place. The waitress however was very rude. She actually returned the tip I gave her.. I don't know what type of ego she had but to return a tip to a customer? You probably need to revaluate your career choice.

Great food though!"}
{"text":"Food is decent but the music is ridiculously loud!  I felt sorry for the waitress who had to continually scream at patrons in order to be heard.  It was impossible to carry on a conversation.  Food was meh - okay .... (the Diavolo pizza was pretty good), but we won't be back because we want to be able to have a conversation when we're out for dinner.

It was really packed at 8 pm on a Friday evening so make a reservation - or don't - and go somewhere else entirely.  Somewhere where you can carry on a conversation.  You've been warned."}
{"text":"Went here with a big group of people. The atmosphere was really nice and they have lots of big tables.

The menu looked a bit expensive, but when the food came, the portions turned out to be really big. I had to share my pizza with other people. For pasta, you can order a bigger size and ask the waitress to split them into two. 

Overall, we ordered pizza, different pastas, cheese, and some sandwiches and everything tasted pretty delicious."}
{"text":"Downtown location has better service and food.  definitely won't be back to this location in Richmond Hill.  It was a party of three and we waited for 30 minutes for our main course to arrive and the worst was that the pasta seemed to have been waiting on kitchen counter for a while before someone finally picked it up and delivered to us. Server provided minimum service."}
{"text":"Went for a Bday dinner for mother in law... Ordered the pesto Pollo and the veggies pasta... The sauces were each different and good in their way.... Needed a little salt but other than was good... Also order the verge option  pizza.. Was very flavorful and delicious..."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of dining at Scaddabush, Richmond hill, ont, on Friday, January 29, 2016. Scaddabush is a rustic Italian style kitchen who prepare handmade mozzarella and fresh made pasta on site! We rate the deco a 3/5. The deco is very casual with an open kitchen, exposed brick walls throughout the dining room, mason jar deco, mismatched tables and chairs. We were unfortunately sitting at a high table top and being a tall person, I was rather uncomfortable as the table skirt was too low for the stool I was sitting on. The lighting was comfortably low however the noise travelled through the restaurant bouncing off the walls. The menus were printed in a small font making it quite difficult to read. We rate the cleanliness a 4/5. The tables, chairs glasses, dishes and utensils looked quite clean. We walked up to the kitchen to observe the mozzarella chef and noticed the stations were very clean and organized, bravo! The restrooms were kept up quite well. However, I must say that myself and another women thought the stalls were quite awkward getting in and out of as they seemed to be to tight. We rate the service a 2.5/5. This is where we were a bit disappointed. Initially, our waitress was very helpful, she was informative and quite knowledgable of the menu. She made a couple of recommendations that we took her up on. However, she didn't check back with us enough. We had to enthusiastically flag down other wait staff for help. Our drinks were not served properly as the bartender forgot to garnish a \"shock top\" beer, our sodas were forgotten and a wine refill order came as I was finishing up my entree. Not impressed. Finally, the food. We rate the food a 4/5. The food is the star of the show for this restaurant . Quite satisfying to the pallet. The handmade mozzarella was scrumptious! The fresh made pasta was wonderful! Although the sapore  of the tomato sauce had an American/ Italian taste it was still very enjoyable. Overall, we rate Scaddabush a 3/5 and recommend you try it out. Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"Perfect Valentine's Day lunch! The staff was wonderful in accommodating our seating request and was very patient with a late arrival. The food arrived in a timely manner and was delicious. (I highly recommend the chicken parmesan).

We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Food and service was great! our server was fantastic as well, very attentive. We had the lobster spaghetti (I highly recommend this!) and the Chicken Parm.  Fresh mozzarella was good!. Their peach mango bellini was good and we also had the cheesecake and tiramisu.(Both are absolutely delish.) I will be coming back and would definitely recommend to others."}
{"text":"Its a great place for dinner. Solid choice if you're confused on where to go."}
{"text":"I had the Sophia pizza and it was pretty good but with tax and was $23 which is my biggest problem with the place: price for what you get.

This is westernized Italian cooked in a Milestones-chain way. When I come to places of this ilk, it is admittedly usually tasty but very generic and over priced. I don't like coming to these places because I can get better, tastier, more unique food for a lot less. This type of food is so ubiquitous. I would never choose to go to these type of places myself.

The service was nice, the servers were pleasant and the decor was not bad."}
{"text":"Stuck to the classics and we didn't go wrong! After reading the mediocre reviews, was not super excited to try this place. Friday night we knew our options were limited without any reservations. Got here and seated prompted. Waitress was attentive and friendly. The reviews weren't fantastic so decided to play it safe and stick to the simple stuff - like pizza and apps. Ordered calamari and Tuscan salad. Both great and on point. Kids had kids meal pizzas and adults had Diavolo pizza and Italian burger. Again, nothing negative to say at all about both! Burger was exceptionally yummy! Kids meal came with a build-ur-own gelato sundae which they both LOVED. Great experience, would def come back!"}
{"text":"The food amazing and it had lots of flavour and pop but made a mistake by giving us apple juice instead of the sprite we ordered. Over all very good a would come back many more times"}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Good wine selection
And good meat ball spaghetti!
I probably went here more than 10 times. Tried a lot of their dishes and liked majority except a few. They are famous for meatball spaghetti and this is something i always order if i go with new ppl. Their bomba burrita? is a great app to share. I just love this dish. Service is amazing too. I wasnt a fan of their steak... it was a bit tough to chew. Also the carbonara is made from penne which i didnt really understand. It was more like a alfreado sauce than carbonara. Other than that everything is good! Great for romantic dinner too."}
{"text":"The decor was amazing. Service was fine. Unfortunately, the use of garlic and oregano was incredibly overbearing which is a common mistake by non- authentic Italian restaurants. Sorry SIR Corp...but your other restaurants are pretty good."}
{"text":"Realized this restaurant was fairly new, so I decided to try it out. This location definitely exceeded my standards. Had the lobster spaghetti which was really tasty, and the appetizers are fantastic as well. As the night went on, i liked this place more and more because of the heart service that came along with the food. I highly recommend scaddabush to anyone who has not visited this location before."}
{"text":"The menu has a nice selection for every pallet and our server recommended we try the meatball as it was one of the more popular dishes. We shared the meatball and each got our own entrees which were large enough that we couldn't order dessert! The food was a 8/10 but service a 5/10. This is a good place for an Italian dinner date and I will be returning to try the fresh mozzarella!"}
{"text":"We came here after a Jays game and our server didn't come to our table after a few minutes. When she did come to take our order, she apologized and a manager came over to apologize as well. After we ordered our food, the manager came by to tell us that our food was going to be paid for by the restaurant. We didn't complain or ask for any of this - we were very impressed by the service and we will return again and again."}
{"text":"Visited with a group of 9 people.  Service was good considering we had 9 at the table.  Food was OK.  I had the chicken parmesan with herb and garlic buttered spaghetti.  The chicken was a bit overcooked and dry, lacking that parmesan bite.  The fresh made spaghetti was hard in places and clumped / stuck together.  Could have been better.  The Americano pizza looked great, as did the baked penne carbonara.  Best looking item on our table of 9 was the spaghetti and stuffed meatball, which will be my choice if we get the chance to return."}
{"text":"Last time I was here, I sat on a dirty tray that was left on my chair, & was told I would be compensated on my bill, but never was. 

This time, I ordered a Bellini, but all the blenders were broken so I opt for a sangria... 

**You know a nice wine mixture in a WINE GLASS with FRUITS**

 I got my sangria in a typical glass with a straw. I told the waiter me and my friends ordered a sangria and he said this is it. It looked like water and tasted like it too. We then asked where the fruits were in the sangria? The waiter said oh they ran out... Okay, If you ran out of fruits.. Why didn't you tell us instead of charging us $8.50 for half a drink? 

I do not recommend scaddabush at all. Mediocre food with horrid service."}
{"text":"Scaddabush is a solid option if you can't decide on a place to go. They're located at East Beaver Creek among all the other eateries so parking will be a hassle if you're coming at prime time (try coming at 7ish). 

We ordered they're naked mozzarella for an app. which has been raved about by others and we found those people to be right. It came with the mozzarella of course, pieces of bread, and a side of garlic and spicy jam. One mistake we made was by putting too much garlic, it'll overpower everything and you won't be able to enjoy it! Thankfully we only ruined a small portion of the moz. Definitely recommend it if you're getting an appetizer.

We also ordered the pesto fettuccine and the butcher pizza. Both were delicious and I can't complain about them. Service was extremely friendly and the waitresses took good care of us. 

Be sure to look out for coupons you get in the mail as this is the reason we decided to make our first visit here, and it probably won't be our last!"}
{"text":"This place seems to always be busy, which is a pretty good sign you are doing something right.  

I arrived around 9 on a Sunday night and since there was nothing immediately available I offered to wait for a table. The hostess was very courteous and was able to find a table for me in short order.  Cannot say enough about the service at the front.  The host and hostess had just dealt with two incredibly rude (entitled) customers in front of me but the hostess was still able to compartmentalize and greet me like an old friend.  A+.  

My server, Mitch, was friendly and outgoing.  Attentive but not hovering, and happy to discuss menu items and take care of a couple small special requests.  Glasses were never empty and I never had to look around to find him - always available when needed.  Also A+.

The food.  Overall, I was pleased but I did take off a star here as I was a little disappointed in the house mozzarella.  They make a very big deal out of it on the menu and on their website and I thought it was good, but not amazing.  Good for sharing.  My order was relatively dry, which is fine, but I thought it lacked flavor.  

Penne Bolognese was a good basic choice.  Noodles were a bit firm but that is my preference, between molto and al dente, towards al dente.  Really not a fan of the \"poor man's parmesean.\"  I don't want bread crumbs in my pasta - if anything I want parmesean, and I would expect reggiano at these prices.  I am sure it would have been provided if I asked, but I just wanted to eat.  

Portion sizes were more than adequate - I'd imagine larges are really just for sharing.

Coffee was excellent after the meal - tasted freshly brewed even at 10:30 at night.  Would actually be happy just to come back for coffee but usually to crowded."}
{"text":"I'd highly recommend Scaddabush for lunch/dinner or even to host an event there! I actually did both and both times I was surpassed by the service and the quality of the food. 

The event staff was beyond amazing! So attentive and just plain nice and helpful! It was so refreshing to have that type of service for a corporate event. I was coming in from out of town to host this event, so it was taking a chance but it surpassed my expectations!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner while vacationing in Toronto and had a great time! Wasn't expecting much for Italian in Toronto, but was pleasantly surprised by how delicious the food was. I ordered the baked penne carbonara (homemade pasta), which was delicious, although a little too much black pepper. The spinach dip was delicious, along with the salads and everything else we had. The atmosphere is casual and cozy, and the service was great. An excellent find right on the main strip near our hotel (The Fairmont Royal York) as well as the CN tower. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"The salad was very bad, and the veggie sandwich awkward. The burger was good. In the end when we got the bill, they had items on there that we didn't order."}
{"text":"It was good is the most I can say. Went here for lunch, ordered a margarita pizza, the entree brick chicken and a stuffed meatball sandwich with soup. The pizza was nice but being a place that promotes fresh mozzarella, I felt like the cheese was a little under seasoned. The chicken in the entree was great. Nicely seasoned with a great crispy skin. The pasta that came with it was not very memorable. The meatball sandwich is very overwhelming with meat. I think a stuffed meatball has pepperoni and cheese inside but couldn't really taste it. The winner here for me was the soup that came with it! Tomato fennel seed with croutons and cheese. It was so tasty I enjoyed every spoonful before taking on the sandwich!

If the prices were less gut wrenching then I would've giving Scaddabush a forth star. However, all the above without any drinks for a lunch totaling over $50? We were very full and the service was good but money could've been better spent."}
{"text":"I visited this resturant for the first time. I had great time with my family. After we ordered the food, it was served to us on time. Our food tasted really good just as decribed. The best part of the night was the dessert. I would def. go back to this place and would recommend to my family and friends."}
{"text":"ambience rustic with mismatch decor, cutlery with normal cloth wrap. Mismatch appetizer plates. Ordered appetizer ls very oily(drenched) charity bread small portion good cause also fries extremely oily. For Saturday mid afternoon empty maybe three clients in total. Food arrived fast, service was quick, as it wasn't busy. We ordered appetizers-meal-dessert and coffee. Pictures include somethings we ate. Also I house mozzarella, we asked for taste test. Would I return will do, but would say relax on the oil."}
{"text":"I had very high expectations for this restaurant because their location downtown could easily be one of my favorite restaurants in Toronto. 
However, I was very much disappointed. I went on a Wednesday night and the restaurant was not very busy, but the service was very slow. It took our waitress 10 minutes after we were seated to greet us and after we ordered our food, it took a while for them come. Our waitress was mostly unavailable during our entire visit, I had to ask the hostess for Blackpepper. 

As for the food, I ordered the diovolo pizza which was pretty delicious except for one thing. The pizza was not hot, it was at most warm. I would even consider it cold for a restaurant like this. My friend ordered a pasta which in my opinion was very mediocre. It was again cold already when it was served to us. The most unacceptable part of the dish was that the pasta at the bottom was all mushed together and it was very chewy. 

Going back to the service, it took her 10 minutes to bring us the credit card machine. I decided to pay cash instead and was ready to leave by the time our waitress brought over the machine. 

I really hope to see some improvement in the near future."}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I went for lunch.  Our first time at Scaddabush. We don't eat much and we usually Share a meal with a big salad.   We asked the waitress for the large plate vs the \"small\" as stated on the menu.  Later we found she charged us for a \"social\" sharing bowl and our lunch bill was over $50 without the drinks!  She may have mentioned the \"social\" bowl but she should have stated clearly that it is not on the menu and the cost. When we pointed that out she should have gotten management to fix that for us.   Although our Shrimp Spaghetti was delicious and well presented and service great.   This deception deflated the new experience there.   So be careful when you order.   So only a 3 star for them."}
{"text":"The fresh mozzarella was the bomb! The server was humorous and friendly. Would definitely go back again and again!"}
{"text":"There was a pretty good dj Friday night. Food was better than I remembered. And service was quite decent. 

The Naked Mozerella doesn't disappoint. But I forgot the carbonara wasn't a base of spaghetti, so heads up.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is my second time dining at Scaddabush. Things have improved, it got busier and the severs are more attentive this time. Came on a Friday night around 9pm, got seated at the back of the restaurant. Until then, I realized this restaurant is BIG indeed.

My first experience in here was a so-so. Food/service was a pass, and so I did not bother leaving a yelp review as I believe they needed some time and space to improve given they are not opened too long ago.

Meatball - which seems to be something that everyone has ordered or interested in ordering; not bad, big in size just like how the pictures look, meaty, moist, with good seasonings but not the kind to die-for
Baked carbonara penne - this has exceeded my expectations, very creamy, rich, saucey, well seasoned with chunks of bacon that is NOT overcooked; which is very important to me. I prefer bacon that is well fried but not being overkilled. Loved the presentation! Interesting note tho, it does not actually taste like the classic carbonara you would have elsewhere because it is more creamy than usual but I just loved it. It is like a combo of carbonara and alfredo pasta if you know what I mean. Try it! 

Going to come back to try other pasta they have on the menu. It is a place that you don't mind coming back because the service/drinks selection/food menu are decent."}
{"text":"Pastas are good, but are a bit overcooked. Good selection of beers and other drinks. Good overall service."}
{"text":"The appetizers are pretty good as well as their house made pasta and great service, don't like the pizza tho."}
{"text":"I have been to this location on 4 separate occasions and unfortunately each time gets worse and worse. Last night will be the last time i visit this particular location. 
The whole evening was oddly unfortunate. Beginning with the fact that when we came in with a group of 5, we were told we would have to wait... and then the host walked away...even though there was only 3 other tables being served.. in the entire restaurant. She sat us at a table that may have been able to fit 3 people.. maybe.. 
we asked to move.
Our server then took 25 minutes to bring our drink orders, 2 Caesars, 2 beer.. and a coke we had to remind her about. 
We were there for two hours and were never asked again if we would like another drink... not even water.. which one of the members of our group ended up taking from a bucket filled with ice he happened upon. 
One of our group members had their food served about 20 minutes before anyone else had food in sight. She let it sit in front of her as she had specifically asked for it to be brought out with all of our meals. No one asked if there was anything wrong, if she liked it or not.. nothing 
When the rest of our food arrived no one came to check on anything, we had to ask a bus boy to bring pepper to our table. 
The food was ok, but portions were very small, and people were still hungry after dinner. 
I am not one to write reviews Or to berate people.. who knows what happened to that server previous to her shift... but I have never experienced neglect like that in a restaurant before. Neither myself or anyone from our party will be returning to this location. That was by far the worst experience I've had"}
{"text":"It's a good place for pizza and pasta. The restaurant is quite large and it has unique utensils and overall design.
However, my friend who has allergies to peanuts has an issue with Scaddabush, although she told the waiter/waitress' of her allergies she tends to still have issues. This can be very dangerous and should be fixed."}
{"text":"Their food was excellent . I hardly go out for Italian restaurants and my go to place is cibo. but this place really did excite my taste buds lol... we had the chicken pizza which was my absolute favorite. 
We also got the sausage pasta and the chicken parm 
I would just like the drinks to taste more alcoholic."}
{"text":"Came to Toronto from Indiana and with it being our first day stumbled across this place. Absolute amazing food and the drinks were incredible. Environment is so unique and can be a little loud but still a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! The best italian restaurant in city spaghetti with meatballs were super perfect and pumpkin ravioli was good too... i loved the place and food"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight with my friend. It's our first time at Scaddabush so we weren't sure what to expect. 

Overall we were pleasantly surprised. For the appetizer, we ordered a salad - the Caprese - which is arugula, tomato and mozzarella with a balsamic vinaigrette dressing. This salad was definitely our favourite. The tomatoes were so sweet it tasted like candy. They also make their mozzarella fresh, which we got to watch as we sat right infront of the kitchen. 

For the main course I ordered the Americano pizza - which is pretty much just tomato sauce, mozzarella and pepperoni. However this pizza was baked on fresh made dough so it was really yummy as well. The portion size is huge too so probably best to share as I only ate half. My friend had the Pesto Pollo which is fettuccine with chicken, sun-dried tomatoes with a pesto cream sauce - also pretty good! For the pasta, you also get to select the size: either small, large or social. We ordered the small size for the pasta and found it to be enough given all the food we had already. 

For dessert, we got the chocolate toffee jar cake which was okay. Looked better than it tasted in my opinion. As for drinks, we had the blood orange cucumber mojito which was recommended to us by our server - also not bad. 

We also signed up on scaddabush.com to join their social club and got an email for $25 off $50 next time we go. This deal expires Jan 31 2016. Highly recommend signing up before dining in as the email can take up to 24 hours to get to your inbox as stated on their website. We weren't able to use this deal at the restaurant as we signed up while eating and the email didnt arrive until we were home. 

Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Great food! 

We came here Friday evening at around 6:30PM and got seated quickly with no wait time. 
The seating area we were in was very open and had an odd amount of space around our table... seemed like an inefficient use of space.

To start, we ordered the \"Naked\" Fresh Mozzarella ($11.98) which was awesome. Highly recommend ordering this! For mains, we shared the Pesto Pollo ($18.97), which they asked if we wanted to split it into 2 dishes for us which was helpful, and the Smoked Bacon & Egg Pizza ($15.96). Pasta was pretty good but nothing amazing, not too different from pasta at any other Italian restaurant. The pizza was unique in that it had a lightly poached egg in the center that you break and spread over the pizza which gave a light egg-y taste which I enjoyed. You also had to cut the pizza yourself and it came with a pair of scissors for that. 

The setting was pretty good, dimly lit and service was helpful in providing the above recommendations. Overall a good Italian eating experience and would come back - if only for the mozzarella."}
{"text":"AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!!
The worst service we have ever experienced. We had 8 different staff members bring us our \"food\". 
Premium price for very substandard Italian food; I am not sure what the concept is supposed to be. ...SIR Corp missed the boat on that one!!!"}
{"text":"My overall experience with this restaurant was extremely disappointing. This was probably the worst experience we've ever had at a restaurant!

It started off with wait times: we showed up at 8:00PM and put our name on the wait list. We were told that we would be seated by 8:30PM and that they'd call us. On our way out of putting our name on the list, we counted 5 tables for 4 empty, waiting to have people seated.

We finally got our call at 8:50PM. We were seated promptly, and then waited for 10 minutes for a waiter to arrive at our table. He poured us waters, and then asked us for our drink orders and our meal orders at the same time.

A child in our group asked for just a bowl of pasta with cream sauce. The waiter rudely squatted down next to the child and said \"that's not an option\" quite loudly. He went on with the child, saying that he would modify the most expensive pasta to make it just with cream sauce.

We received our meals at 9:45PM. One of the members of my party ordered a pizza with no onions on it. We called over our waiter, and he told us that he put in the order with special instructions: no onions. He then proceeded to tell us that there weren't onions on the pizza (which there clearly were). What happened to \"the customer is always right\"? We sent away for a new pizza which arrived 10 minutes later, with a different waiter.

Everything (minus the pizza) arrived cold. Oh, and I forgot to mention, the drinks arrived at 10:10PM! He forgot to get them altogether, and ignored us when we tried to get his attention. We ended up asking another waiter for our drinks.

Our food itself was sub-par, with nothing special about any of it. I understand that it was busy, but people who work in the back should always try to make every meal the best."}
{"text":"Came here because my boyfriend is absolutely obsessed with this place! 

Celebrated his birthday here - made the reservation a few days beforehand. Got a phone call a day before confirming my reservation. While on the phone, I asked if it was possible to do a tiramisu cake for his birthday.

We had the fresh mozzarella (amazing) and we both had pizza. I've had their carbonara before but it was nothing spectacular so I decided on their pizza. Don't remember exactly what it was called, but there was a raw egg which was great. Wasn't able to finish the pizza so we were able to get it to go. 

Waitress was great! She came by pretty often to make sure our food was good. She explained that the tiramisu typically isn't part of the Birthday desert but they made an exception. I do have to admit though, she disappeared as soon as she gave us our bill.

Overall good service and food. Would come back again!"}
{"text":"Scaddabush has been open for a while and as a disclosure this is not my first time dining at the chain or this location in particular. 

Food 2/5
To keep it short and sweet, food was subpar. Calamari and charity bread as appetizers were okay, nothing mind blowing. I had the roasted fennel and sausage fettuccine which was once again okay but lacked flavour. Pasta is supposedly freshly made but were overcooked in my opinion. The dish was greasy, coating my mouth with oil with every bite but at the same time was dry because it didn't have enough sauce.

Service 1/5
It was busy on a Thursday and my party of 5 had previously made reservations. Surprisingly enough reservations had to wait to be seated while we saw group after group of walk ins get seated before us. The hostess seemed inexperienced and flustered as she asked us seating  preference then changed her mind and said it wasn't available. Fast forward to the service which got even worse as the night went on....server did check in on us while we waited for the rest of the party. However once they arrived he was barely to be seen and took 15 minutes before we could flag him down and order. Throughout the whole night he seemed rushed and didn't quite seem to have time for us. At the end of the night he brought us the bill but we forgot we had coupons. He seemed annoyed, crumpled up all the checks in front of us and left disgruntled. 

All in all this experience was definitely the worst I've had at any Scaddabush locations. The highlight of my evening was having him toss my credit card receipt and card at me. I love having people toss me my belongings right after I pay and give them tip. I gave the service a one because at least I able to get my food."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times now and have not been disappointed! I do recommend to make a reservation, wait times can be from 1-2 hours. Also, arrive early to find parking. It can get chaotic! The restaurant has a cute rustic vibe which is really cozy. The service is great and the food is ahhhh-mazing! Try their fresh mozzarella, especially the bomba burrata. It is to die for! You're not gonna wanna share this baby! Other favs include the lobster spaghetti, shrimp spaghetti, chocolate toffee jar cake and tiramisu! I will definitely be going back! They are also opening a new location in Scarborough around June. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant.! We went to celebrate a family birthday. From the time we were seated, our server took care of all our needs and provided some great recommendations from the menu. The place had good energy and ambiance. Must tries- fresh mozzarella, shrimp spaghetti and the giant meatball!"}
{"text":"Not an expert on Scaddabush's authencity as an italian restaurant, but I love their mozzarella cheese! You must order this as a side when you come here simply because it's good and because their entree portions are otherwise not huge anyway.

The entire plaza here are scattered with restaurants, as such it can get pretty busy during weekend dinner time.  Scaddabush is towards the outskirt of the plaza, so you may have better luck trying to park behind/around the back of the restaurant.  The interior has a dining area and a more bar/lounge area.  I prefer the bar area where there are TVs all around.  In the summer time, their patio is also gorgeous - a little area with vines and greenery and is a perfect spot for a sangria.

Scaddabush has a variety of pasta and pizza.  Their pizza is delicious - crust is thin just the way I like it."}
{"text":"3 weeks ago they were still Alice Fazoolis which i love but Scaddabush is also one of my faves when i tried it downtown.

Compared to downtown Scaddabush... i like downtown bwtter for the service, food and surroundings. 

Compared with Alice Fazoolis .. i like Alice Fazoolis better.

 Their food isn't bad but it's not amazing. We ordered fried cauliflower and artichoke to start and it was average. Our mains were salmon and sirloin .. was okay but again not amazing. I swapped my potatoes from the salmon for the caprese and that was also not amazing. We had the zeppole for dessert (soft tim bits) ans they were ok but not amazing.

I'd come back but I wouldn't crave for the food.

I came on a Wednesday and they did have a $5 5 oz wine special. 

The decor didn't change too to much from Alice but still nice.

They make their pasta fresh but they don't have angel hair.

I came with an online coupon of 25% off your bill due to grand opening. They also gave me another coupon of spend $50 get $25"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon for a friends birthday celebration. She had made reservations via open table, super convenient online UI. I was greeted by the hostess right away who showed me to my table. Minutes after our waitress Julia came by to introduce herself to us. The menu had a lot of selection. Julia highlighted some features such as the feta salad and the meatball. 
Unfortunately the mozzarella was not available during the lunch hour. I opted to try their meatball with a side of sautéed mushrooms. 
The meatball was portioned well. It looks great. It was stuffed too so it had cheese and pepperoni inside. The first few bites were delicious. I do understand why they serve this as a shareable now. After the first few bites its too much salt. I couldn't finish my meatball since it was so salty. As well the sautéed mushrooms were the same.my friend who also ordered a stuffed meatball also said it was too salty as well. 
Meatball is good when kept as a shareable tho! 

Since it was my friends birthday, a cake in a jar also came with a sparkler complimentary. That was a nice touch to celebrate the occasion.

I would come again, but I would order something else. Also looking forward to trying their mozzarella"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Waiting for 30min to be seated on a table, although half restaurant was empty. Then the heater in patio stopped working, no service the next 30mins. Waiters promising to make everything right, manager coming to table with empty promises. After 90min waiting, we decided to leave the restaurant and no one even bothered to say even sorry. That's it, no more Scaddabush for me."}
{"text":"I was always a big fan of Alice Fazooli's so when I heard that Scaddabush had taken over, I did not know what to expect but had to give it a try. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised. 

We went on a Friday night and the restaurant was bumping. The vibes were good, the decor was nice, there was great music and it was not too loud - it was the place to be. They have an open concept kitchen so if your table is close to the kitchen, you get to see them cook which I really liked. The servers all sang along to the music which made it more entertaining and fun. The servers are very friendly and will go out of their way to help you, even if they are not serving your table.

We ordered the Calamari Fritti to start and when it comes to calamari, I can be very picky. But I was not disappointed; it was pretty good. My boyfriend ordered the Americano pizza and it was absolutely delicious. The only reason this review is 4 stars instead of 5, is due to my order of the Capri Pasta. I normally love seafood pasta, but I was pretty let down. There was not enough sauce and not much seafood. The pasta was not the greatest and they were stuck together.

But overall, it's a great restaurant and I would definitely come back. Prices are very reasonable. If you sign up for their Scaddabush Social Club (it's their free emailing list) on their website, you can get discounts."}
{"text":"Small portions, salty, and oily.  I will not be coming back to this restaurant.  Came for lunch and ordered the stuffed meatball ($14), charity bread with cheese ($5) and baked cabonara ($16).  All 3 were tiny pirtions and not worth the price.  Maybe if it tasted better that could justify it, but the bread and meatball were both very salty, and the bread was too overly soaked in oil for my taste.  The baked cabonara is very basic, aside from the novelty of being served up in a small cast iron dish with some breadcrumbs, the taste was below average.  It's also not a true cabonara with eggwash sauce, more like alfredo sauce with bacon salt and pepper and an egg on top.  Service was fine, no issues there, and atmosphere is the same as the previous Aliz Fazoolis."}
{"text":"Scaddabush in Richmond Hill location was originally Alice Fazooli's. Menu is pretty much similar to Alice Fazooli's. Been to Scaddabush about 6 times since opened. 

The pizza is good, a quick fix for something near the area in Markham (but I like another restaurant located in downtown, Toronto). **Remember to ask for the chilli oil**  

I tried 4/8 types of pasta they have and I liked none of them solely because there wasn't enough sauce (for all pasta I ordered), not enough flavor and pasta was a bit over cooked to a bit soggy. Bare in mind I tried the 4 types of pasta at different visits. So I wouldn't order pasta from their menu anymore. For the price, I'd go to other western cuisine restaurant for much better quality pasta (in the same plaza). 

Their mozzarella is famous for being freshly made everyday. They are good if you have someone to share or if you go as a group so everyone can have a try. 

I tried their bruschetta (classic & pork 3-ways) and I personally love the pork 3 ways. Very tasty, the bread was grilled/baked with butter; it was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside (not rock hard). Good sociables with a few friends sipping on some drinks. 

Their classic vs. stuffed meatballs, I liked classic. Juicy, aromatic and just the right taste paring with beer.  

*They have drinks specials on Wed & Thurs. 

*They have a social club, you can sign up and receive $10 off coupon (takes 24hrs) and get most updated information from the company and get invited to social meets and parties."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend and another couple for lunch and was not disappointed! The drink specials are reasonable and the food is also delicious. I'd recommend their pizza as well as their large meatballs!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I came here on a Friday night around 7pm to celebrate my birthday. Surprisingly, it was not busy during this busy dinner time. Food was really good. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer, I had the fettuccine capri (regular size), and she had the chicken parmesan. All were really good! No complaints whatsoever! For dessert we ordered the tiramisu, and a complimentary chocolate toffee cake was given to us with sparklers since my friend secretly mentioned to our waitress that it was my birthday. It was a great birthday dinner celebration! 

The only reason why I am taking off a star was because during certain times, it seemed as if the live DJ kept on increasing the volume, making it hard for my best friend and I to hear each other, especially on top of everyone else trying to raise their voices over the loud music.

In conclusion, for the first time being here, I absolutely loved my experience! Food was great, waitress was helpful and good with checking up on us, easy to get a table, and music was good but volume could be turned down a notch. I will definitely be back in the future!"}
{"text":"I am Santiago GYpsioloo and I a say AH MAMA MIA OK. Food good but not exacto like in CALABRIA"}
{"text":"I've gone here several times for lunch and it's just passable at best. Over priced for what it is and nothing really stands out. I've had the gnocchi which was on the specials menu and it was ok - but the portion was not worth $17 dollars and the balsamic flavor ruined it and also came luke warm. Today I had the avocado and goat cheese bruschetta which was quite huge but towards the end all i could taste was the cilantro."}
{"text":"The place had a really nice vibe...dim lighting, spacious, very good service. The menu was mostly pizza, sandwiches, and pasta which was expected at an Italian restaurant. I ordered the fettuccine capri which was basically fettuccine in a tomato sauce with parmesan cheese, mussels, shrimps, and squid. It was rather disappointing. I've consistently found a problem with fettuccine in which the individual pasta would stick onto one another and become very paste-y. The seafood was pretty good, especially the huge shrimp. The shells of the mussels sometimes broke up (during the cooking process) and I would sometimes get bits of shells mixed it when I was biting into the pasta. I wished the waitress would come around asking if we wanted extra parmesan as it was basically nonexistent when served. I also tried a slice of my friend's pizza...again, nothing impressive and on the poor side. It used goat cheese which I enjoyed but obviously it doesn't spread / melt as well as mozzarella so using that as the base was not the best choice. All the other toppings were very mediocre again. The biggest problem is that everything became cold so fast after being served. This is a huge problem with Italian food because pasta does not taste good cold. Oh, just to add to this, it was very expensive. I ended up paying $27 after tips and tax for one ok-portion bowl of pasta. There is a small size option but we asked the waitress, and she told us that people normally order regular anyways. It's pretty small."}
{"text":"It is my first time being at a Scaddabush restaurant and we were greeted nicely by the hostess. She got us seated and our dinner experience began. 

For our Appetizer we ordered Naked Mozzarella which had Crostini, Freshly made Mozzarella, San Marzo Tomato sauce and Maldon salt. We also ordered 3 Cheese bread which had Asiago and two other cheeses that I do not remember. 

For our main course we got the Baked Penne Carbonara, Zucca Ravioli and the swirly pasta that was on the top of the pasta list with the long Italian name. 
The Carbonara and the unknown pasta came but our waiter didn't get my order which was the Ravioli and rushed the order for me. 

The Mozzarella was the best part of the dinner experience. But sadly the 3 Cheese Bread, Carbonara, Ravioli and the other pasta was a bit mehhhh. After taking a few bites of the Ravioli, I just got completely sick of it. But I finished it anyways not because I liked it, but because I do not want to waste the food. 

In conclusion this chain fine dining restaurant is 'aight'. Service 'aight'. Food 'meh' and I wasn't even full after dinner. 
Sadly will not come again. 

If the PR person is reading this. Please get your Corporate Executive Chef to revise this menu and make sure that the least favourite foods are revised in order to get better reviews both in person and online. Go ask your staff to eat the whole menu and ask them what they loved and what they hated. Make the waiters ask customers for their legit and honest opinion on the ambience, the food and the service. Make the executives eat three courses on the menu everyday and ask them what they loved and what they hated. 

This sadly is my first restaurant that I absolutely disliked. Even bad chinese take out restaurants seem a bit better than what I was served. Presentation is nice but food lacks in taste. 

Service 3/5
Ravioli 1/5
Unknown Pasta 1/5
Carbonara 2/5
3 Cheese Bread 1/5
Mozzarella 5/5

Total Score: 2.6/5"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner back in Feb and ordered a spaghett and meatball. It was just an average meal- nothing special. 

But then i came back again just last week for lunch and overall i must say i prefer our lunch experience more.
We got to sit in the nice cute little patio, ordered a few dishes for sharing:

- fresh mozarella with prosciutto
- Mario pizza
- Zucchini fritti
- pitcher of sangria (red)

The menu says the mozarella could be ordered from 5pm onwards- however we had a late lunch around 3-4 ish, and asked if we could place an order, the server said they could make it for us :) we got lucky !!!

The fresh mozarella was the best dish out of our meal, and i would recommend you to order this as an appetizer for sharing. 
The sangria was pretty good as well.
The rest of the meal was ok, nothing spectacular.

The bill came up to around $30 per person for the 3 of us, which it's pretty decent considered we ordered a whole pitcher of sangria. 

Overall, the food is average, but service is great"}
{"text":"Went there as a get-together with a few friends.

Location/Environment:
Took over Alice Fazooli.  Interior wise it has not changed from before - good for groups/kids.  They have high chairs by the bar, they have cozy tables and big tables for groups.  Can take reservations.  We went on a Sunday night, not jammed pack yet - but it might in the future.  I always liked the environment there - pretty casual and perfect for a long chat with family/friends.

Service:
Our waiter was very nice - he gave some recommendations when we asked and suggested how to portion too. They have small, large, sociables sizes.  Sociables are the best for larger groups, but having the option of small & large is also convenient if you want to eat more dishes and not overwhelm yourself with the amount.  Other staff there are also nice and approachable, I believe it's the same staff from Alice Fazooli.

Food:
Ordered several items.
- Bomba Burrata fresh mozzarella.  I was always a fan of mozzarella - so it was delicious!  Crunchy on the outside, gooey and soft on the inside.  The chili and spicy roasted tomato sauce complimented very well (especially if you want second dips)
- Stuffed meatballs.  This is one of their signature dishes.  Gigantic with lots of filling.  The Angus Beef was well done (not to the point that it's dry).  You can order it on its own or as part of the Sociables, Sandwiches or Pasta items.
- Cripsy Polenta Tots.  This was a good selection for an appetizer.  Everything balanced pretty well (mascarpone, Sunday sauce).  It wasn't outstanding that took my breath away - but it's good for a try.
- Bruchetta Mozza & Sun-dried Tomato.  The mozza again was awesome.  The sun-dried tomato was crushed pretty well.  But it was kinda spicy (could be good for some) - so I thought the space over powered the tomatoes.
- Sophia Pizza. Not your typical style pizza.  I like how it's thin crust, there's smaller portions but loaded with toppings.  The marinated chicken & goat cheese blend well together and the caramelized onions helped smooth out the strong taste of the cheese.  I would highly recommend this one.
- Lobster Spaghetti.  There weren't a lot of lobster pieces (probably just a few from its claw), but it wasn't as spicy compared to the bruchetta.  It was very light so it's easy to take in and you don't feel full from eating it.
- Zeppole.  Sweet fried dough serve with chocolate hazelnut sauce.  Nice combo and the dough was fried well (not too oily and still soft on the inside).  It's hollow on the inside, so it's perfect to indulge it in with the chocolate hazelnut sauce (or Nutella as I like to call it)
- Chocolate Toffe Jar Cake.  I really liked this one.  The chocolate ganache was kinda like a brownie (soft and rich) and when you add the toffee together - delicious!  It's sweet but so good.  There's a bit of vanilla whipped cream that doesn't overwhelm the whole dessert.


Overall it's not bad for a first try.  Would like to try some of their drinks/wine next time and a few more interesting items.  Prices are reasonable - for a party of 5, with the amount of food, it was around $16/person.  Now we ordered mostly small portions, but it was enough to feed all of us.  I don't have in-depth knowledge about Italian food, but the variety and environment is enough to keep me coming."}
{"text":"Went here on the weekend because I've heard some good things about this place when it replaced Alice Fazooli's...can't say I was impressed. Sure, the new layout was quite interesting. Hostess that took us to our table was very polite. But let me tell you, as much as I am an impatient person when it comes to being hungry, I was NOT hungry but had to wait AT LEAST 25 minutes for SOMEONE to bring us a glass of water and menus! Any sign of team effort for coverage of tables? NOPE! This waiter kept walking by our table and can CLEARLY see we were not helped at all. Given his attitude with the way he displayed himself and his facial expression, he couldn't care less. Perfect. We even made eye contact and he just looked away like it was nothing. Hmmmmm, ok.

Finally a waitress comes around and gives us the menu and water. She's all smiley and has a super soft voice. I don't care how smiley you can be, do your job properly and own up to your mistake because your smile doesn't fix anything! She takes our order and APPARENTLY because it was too busy (and believe me it was not) she took forever to bring me my drink. Actually, she FORGOT about it. Honestly I'm not even going to continue. Pretty much I was not impressed at all with the service here.

Food was ok. Nothing special. I had the Zucca and I was hoping it would taste pretty good since it was an italian restaurant and I haven't had good ravioli in ages...turned out ok to me but maybe it's just because I got all riled up prior to my food.

I really don't have much else to say about this place. I'm really surprised a couple of my friends said it was really good. Perhaps I will give it another try later but for now, I think I will pass."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Service was horrible, the pasta was undercooked. But mainly, horrible service. Our server said they were busy due to the Blue Jays game - which was going on at the time - so it wasn't pre or post game crowd. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"WE WENT FOR DRINKS BUT GOT HARASSED BY THE STAFF.
I Went for a drink with a couple of friends after we had dinner somewhere else.
We have stated at the door that we are only here for drinks not for dinner, we were welcomed and seated then the drama started when the first girl introduced her self as our waitress and took the orders she asked if we want to eat something and we said that we are only here for drinks, my friends asked for beer so it was easy but I made the mistake to ask for whiskey, the waitress didn't know what whiskey they have and after a few minutes she came back with a small piece of paper with the names of 3 brands only, I chose Chivas. Drinks came on their own no nuts no chips we said fine can we order nuts and chips and we will pay for them but the waitress replied we don't have but you can order food even though we mentioned in the beginning that we are only here for drinks. A couple of minutes after another waitress introduced herself and said that she will be our new waitress and asked if we want to eat something we replied no we are only here for drinks, her smile got smaller and she left but surprisingly she appeared again shortly after asking if we are sure that we don't want to eat something pushing everyone to our edges because it became very annoying. The biggest surprise was when she was replaced by a third silly young waitress came asking if we want to order some food. WTF . We are being harassed in a very annoying way and we are paying for it with what we believe is tactic of the management to make people spend more money. we left very upset because we went there to relax but we ended up pissed off. This place must remove the bar sign and keep the restaurant sign if they can't accommodate bar customers and must respect all customers no matter if they are there to have a couple of drinks or a full meal.
While we were leaving a young gentleman named Andrew asked how were things so we expressed our opinion and he gave us a card that was sitting at the front desk stating $20 off if you spend $40.
Sometimes you can repair the damage but sometimes you can and Sorry this time it won't work because they really spoiled our Saturday evening."}
{"text":"Scaddabush is a decent Italian chain restaurant that we pop into once in a while. Their food is okay, some of it is a hit, our \"go to's\" when we come to the restaurant, but we've tried an overwhelmingly large number of things that have been \"ok.\" They're not bad, but they also aren't quite that satisfying - nor do they hate that \"ahh\" spot. I will say THIS though, at the York Blvd location in Richmond Hill, we have never failed to have bad service thus far. Although wait times have been long, every waiter and waitress that we've had has been very courteous, always ready to make suggestions and always very polite and good at their job - and I'm grateful for that.

Our go-to's that we love: burrata ($14.27); osso bucco bites ($12.97); pesto pollo fettucine (L - $19.33). The burrata and osso bucco bites are wooonderful. The truffle cream is evident in the burrata, it is a bit pricey but for fresh mozz, I ain't complainin'. The osso bucco bites are one of our favs, meaty pork bites, come off the bone so easily and into our mouths. We like the pesto pollo, but when we get it, it's tasted slightly different every time. But overall, one of the pastas we like the most above the other ones.

Tried and are meh but not bad: bomba burrata ($16.27); charity bread - great cause, but fairly salty; caprese ($15.37) - decent caprese salad; italian burger ($16.77) - it was good, the burger was well made, but it's weird that it was on focaccia bread; baked penne carbonara ($17.27) - small portion and only decent; sophia pizza ($16.87) - meh; smoked bacon & egg ($15.96) - actually pretty good, not as heavy as it would seem; mario ($17.37) - solid classic pizza."}

{"text":"I've been to this Scaddabush location twice and didn't really like it as much as the Yonge location. The first time I went, the pesto linguine pasta just didn't taste as great as it usually does. The second time, the service was just outright unacceptable - I came here with a friend to grab a glass of sangria after work. Once the server realized we weren't ordering food, he totally ignored us and acted like it was a crime to be there without a plate of mediocre food in front of us. He also gave me a tough time with my ID even though he was the one who clearly couldn't add up the years to figure out my age. If I could, I would have demanded a refund since the sangria didn't even taste great after that service."}

The Shrimp Spaghetti had an interesting combination of flavours, a rich sauce, and good presentation. Steak was ordered at the table again despite my warnings from my last visit, fortunately it turned out okay this time around though the fries and greens were still too salty for my preference. There seemed to be some confusion between the kitchen and the waiters as our food was \"brought out\" but never arrived to us in some cases, though management took care of the delay acceptably. I would advise on taking a close look at any extra cutlery or plates that may be requested to be brought for the table as it seemed their dishwasher was not performing at top quality...that dampened the experience for me significantly."}
{"text":"Probably one of the finest quality Italian restaurants that I have ever been to. I had the ravioli and it was pure heaven. When I come back to Toronto it's a must stop for myself . The pricing was great"}
{"text":"Food is okay.
Had the fresh mozerella with prosciutto and that was nice with the salt and fig jam. 

Pesto pasta was okay. Heavy cause of the cream sauce. 
Spaghetti and meatball was okay. 

Overall, way better than Alice fazooli. 

I had a great server btw so that made the meal enjoyable. What I didn't enjoy, was how there was an old couple in a booth behind us, and they were making out the whole night. Not classy. Get a room losers!"}
{"text":"Scaddabush opened in Richmond Hill a few weeks ago, so naturally me and the fiancé decided to give it a shot. 

Let me first start by saying, I hate parking in this lot. It's always overcrowded and there are way too many restaurants for the lot, but anyway...

The restaurant itself is very nice, low lit, rustic feel. There are several tvs around that show different sports channels and cooking shows (something for everyone). 

We ordered the bomba buratta as an appetizer. It's a cream stuffed fresh mozzarella with a garnish of chilli and roasted tomatoes and sausage (though the menu says double smoked bacon, I swear it was sausage). It was incredible. Scaddabush is known for their mozzarella, they make it fresh in house daily. It was so good. Definitely worth getting. So creamy, and light and delicious. 

We then ordered a large pesto pollo pasta (fettuccine with pesto, roasted tomatoes, chicken and spinach) and a butcher pizza (bacon, sausage, pepperoni, garlic). It was a lot of food, but so delicious. The bill was just under 60$, and we left stuffed and satisfied. 

Definitely worth coming to, their mozzarella, pasta and meatballs are all made fresh daily in house - I would highly recommend trying them. Glad they have a location up town!"}
{"text":"The interior hasn't changed from when it was Alice Fazooli's. I must say though that I much preferred the food offered by Alice Fazooli's over Scaddabush. 

Not too many items were appealing on the menu as they seemed very standard for a chain restaurant. 

My group decided to order and share apps:
- Calamari fritti 4/5: I think this was the best part of the night for me, the calamari wasn't super tough and was fried just enough. 
- chicken parmesan bites 3/5: the chicken bites were quite salty with the parmesan and the sauce it came with balanced it out but I thought this was only average.

I ordered the butcher pizza and also sampled the bolognese. The pizza was super salty and I could barely finish half of it. The bolognese on the other hand was bland and quite tasteless. 

Will most likely not come back."}
{"text":"I went to Scaddabush for a birthday dinner with friends and had a really pleasant experience. 

The ambience is great with cute chandeliers and rustic decorations; a very photogenic restaurant in my opinion. Cute place for dates!

For appetizers, we got the Naked Mozzarella and it came with a tomato jam, sea salt, and crostini. SO GOOD ! They had some other variations as well and I'm definitely going to try another when I go back. Their menu had a large selection of mains with pastas and pizzas and sandwiches/wraps as well as other main entrees. The nice thing was that most of the pastas came in three sizes. Small, regular and social with the last one aiming to feed 2-3 people. I had the Zucca pasta and it was delicious, slightly sweet with a creamy butternut squash filling. Didn't get a chance to try any of their desserts but will definitely do so when I return. 

Service was a little slow but it was fine since we were in no rush to eat and leave. Props to the waiter for dealing with our super complicated bills at the end.. I felt a little bad."}
{"text":"Want fresh mozzarella? This is your place. They make it in-house and it is very, very good. It is served with beautifully buttered bread, sea salt for sprinkling on top and san marzano tomato 'jam'. This originally was the reason we came back to this place and it was worth it. We also shared a margarita pizza and baked penne carbonara. While the pizza was so-so (the crust was subpar compared to the sauce and cheese) the carbonara was very delicious with a lot of deep flavours. Scaddabush is a great place for very tasty food. You've gotta try it out!"}
{"text":"Service was ok. Food was cold!!!    We have been to others Scaddabush's, one in oakville and one Mississauga. Both we were great. 
This one downtown was disappointing!!!!    
Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim on a Saturday night with my boyfriend before heading to the aquarium. When we got in, we were politely greeted and seated right away. 

I got a peach mango Bellini which was amazing. My boyfriend got a beer but I cannot remember which kind. 
For our appetizer we got the calamari which was delicious. I was very happy with the amount of time it took between finishing our app and actually receiving our meal.  Nothing is worse than having apps and meals crowded all over the place. 

I got the shrimp spaghetti (I asked if they could sub fettucine for the spaghetti and they were happy to do so). My gosh was it delicious. It was so flavorful and satisfying. I was hesitant to share with my boyfriend, who got and very much enjoyed his Margherita pizza. 

The service itself was wonderful. Our waitress was training another waitress, and both were wonderful and attentive. 

My boyfriend and I both agree that we will be coming here again soon so we can try out the fresh mozzarella. My only complaint is that the restaurant is extremely dark...so much so that we had to use the flashlight on my cellphone to read the menus. Both my boyfriend and I wear glasses and found the very dim lighting challenging. The waitress being trained proactively and very sweetly brought us a candle. It didn't help much with being able to see, but a thoughtful gesture nonetheless. I definitely recommended you check this place out. Download a flashlight app before going if your phone doesn't have one built in!  ;)"}
{"text":"Went for dinner before a Raptors game and the staff were very helpful because they knew we were in a rush. They were friendly, efficient, and did everything they could to make sure we finished on time.

The food was pretty good. The naked mozzarella with crostini, sea salt and chilli jam is excellent. I've had some of the other cheeses previously and liked those too, but I love the toppings for the naked mozzarella the most. The fettucine was good too, though not especially filling and the chicken tasted like it was a bit old.

The restaurant has an energetic vibe, but is not overly loud or pretentious. There are TVs everywhere if you want to watch a sporting event."}
{"text":"I have been to Scaddabush in the Mississauga location before but it was our first time in the Downtown TO location. 

The place is big and spacious with tables and booths for seating option. There TV screens throughout the restaurant. We came on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and the place was fairly busy. We were seated in a middle booth inside near the side patio doors. Our waiter was attentive throughout our meal. No complaints about the service. 

Although the restaurant claim being an \"authentic\" Italian eatery, this is not the case. However, their version of Italian food is still very good for a franchise. Please note that prices are a bit high. However, portions sizes are generous. There are no free bread. 

We ordered the Baked Penne Carbonnara, the Chicken Parmesan and The Butcher Pizza (bacon, sausage and pepperoni). We all enjoyed our food although it was a bit salty. I think the pizza can be shared with another person. 

Recommended and will come back again."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday evening, and it was fairly busy. We had made reservations for 7 people through Open Table (call into the restaurant to reserve for tables greater than 6). We originally were 5 people; however, the restaurant had no problems changing out reso to 7 people. 

The food was good but the noodles were a little hard. If it was just a tad softer, it would have been perfect. However, I loved that the Spaghetti Sorentina came with a large mozzarella ball on top. It really was the icing on top of my pasta. I also enjoyed that there was a generous amount of basil. 

Overall, I think the atmosphere is good for a fun night out -- music was a little loud so having a conversation took a little extra effort but I would come back. Keep in mind that the portion sizes are quite generous here -- a sociable plate could probably accommodate 4 people and a regular pasta size was good for 1 (if you're hungry). My friend ordered a small ravioli and it was definitely the perfect portion for 1 person."}
{"text":"I just want to mention this is my 4th visiting this location.

The very first time I came here close to when they opened up, I was very very impressed. 
That might they had a DJ and the vibe was really casual and inviting. 
The service was bomb and the food was great and we were very happy. 

One of the other visits was for my boyfriends birthday and we were a group of 10 people. 
Once again food was good, service aswell maybe just a couple fix ups here and there and one of the pizzas were just a tad burnt. 

On another visit, we were a group of 6 girls and they gave us a really nice booth perfect for pictures and the best view of the restaurant. 
Everything was good except the service was really slow. 

Recent visit: Valentine's Day for early dinner. We didn't reserve but they didn't seem busy at all and we noticed a lot of staff were not that busy aswell. 
We were greeted and we had a pretty good booth.  Once we made our order it took awhile to get to our table and our mains took about the same amount of time. The food was great as always. 
ORDER THE FRESH MOZZARELLA ITS SO GOOD. 
We noticed however that the 3 tables near us have had dirty plates on them for almost over half our stay and finally someone cleaned it up. 
We joined the scaddabush social club and received $10 off. 

The prices are pretty reasonable and they have different sizes for most dishes. 

The best thing about scaddabush is the atmosphere, most tables have candle light and it's so nice and romantic and easy going from top to bottom the decor is spot on. 
The bar looks really nice too, just chill and have a drink."}
{"text":"Good italian food! I can't believe I've never been here before again, I've just never noticed the restaurant. I dropped by here for lunch and it was PACKED - but the service was still very quick and the food was prepared much faster than expected.

I got a pasta dish, and it was tasty! I thought the prices were fair and the quality of the food was very good - this would be a good spot to go out to even on a weekend for dinner. It's not too fancy, but it does provide some good dishes, at reasonable prices with a nice clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Try the meatball. It was tasty. This place is convenient to hotels, not the best Italian I have ever had but employees work Hard with a smile."}
{"text":"This evening my boyfriend and I decided to try out scaddabush and let me tell you it was the best decision we made! We are Italian, so when we go out to eat Italian sometimes, usually it doesn't meet our expectations, but let me tell you scaddabush is the place to be! We started with the mozzarella, the polenta tots and of course the fresh pasta! Food was out of this world! Drinks were amazing! My boyfriend truly enjoys his pints but I love my fruity drinks and let me tell you I found my favourite drink, the passion peach! And let me tell you the zeppole's were Devine! Overall, scaddabush is the place to go too for great service, authentic, fresh Italian food! We will defiantly be back! It's so nice to enjoy real Italian food not having to cook it at home and enjoy great service and great company! Thank you scaddabush for this wonderful experience! Also, I believe our server name was Montana! She was on point, friendly and super efficient !"}
{"text":"Very down to earth, cozy and friendly service. The food is savoury with lots of flavour and comes in a decently filling portion."}
{"text":"Had spaghetti and meatballs and it was very authentic. Felt like I was eating dinner at Nona house. Very good portion could not even finish it and great price to go along. The server at the bar end was very friendly and knew tons about every aspect of the menu."}
{"text":"Man, this is pretty much a much needed facelift for Alice Fazoolis, so I commend them on trying to fix some of the issues they had before, but there are still a few areas that could use more tweaking.

First off, the interior of the restaurant is pretty much the same in terms of space, but this space is used much more appropriately now. They removed that ridiculous giant entranceway and have used lost of the spaces that were empty to fill with tables. This means you get seated a lot faster. The environment is a lot more lively as well, which is a nice improvement. The music was done by a live DJ (which is always a nice touch), but a bit loud if you were to have a conversation. 

For food, the menu itself had some new items, but was both happy and disappointed to see that there were items that were exactly the same. Decided to go for the Naked Mozzarella, the Classic Meatball, and my friend and I got a pasta each, the Pesto Pollo and the Zucca. 
First off, the freshly, in-house made mozzarella was amazing. With a little bit of salt, tomato jam, and bread to go with it, everything came together in a perfect harmony. Would definitely try one of the other mozzarella options again. 
The meatball was quite good as well, nice in-depth flavour, without being too oily or saucy. However, it was the meatball itself that I liked. There was cheese, sauce, and bread that came with the dish that only diminished the meatball's flavour. For one, the cheese on top was way too salty. 

The Pesto Pollo had a good pesto flavour which I liked, and the pairing with sun-dried tomatoes was a nice touch. However, it came with chicken which made the overall pasta seem too dry, as it was an oil based seasoning. The pasta itself was nicely done, as you could taste the freshness as it's made daily, but I usually prefer my pasta more on the al dente side, and they were a bit too soft for me. 
The Zucca was quite good, with a nice moist centre to the ravioli, and a beautifully done cream sauce that was flavourful without being heavy. A nice combination overall. 

The service was decent, but definitely could have improvements. Our main server said they use a 'team service' approach, which meant that we could ask anyone for anything we needed, but the service at our table was lacking. Our main server definitely did her job, but not as much checking-up-on as one would expect at a restaurant like this.

From what I understand, other Scaddabush are much better than this location, so it would interesting to see if this location will get any better. As with a facelift, you can change the outer appearance, but the underlying problems may still need some attention..."}
{"text":"Although its a chain restaurant, i always enjoy my experience here. I love the calamari although my son thinks it's too lemony. I also like the fried zucchini and the polenta tots. My ultimate favorite though is the shimp pasta. I've been to both this location and the one at Front Street and i think the front street one is better in terms of execution - the fried dishes are less greasy and the shrimp pasta was tasti"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and had good size portions. I enjoyed the stuffed meatballs and spaghetti. Full of flavor.  I would have liked a small side of bread or salad with the meal however the portion was large enough to fill me with out ordering any extras.   I did splurge on a take desert to go and was very glad I did. The chocolate jar cake was a great way to end the night.  I was also impressed with the the service.  I sat at the bar as I wanted to see the game on TV and the staff balanced a good mix if talking and acting entertaining while also not talking too much. They made good suggestions and the staff acted like a team to make sure I had all the food and drink I needed. The music was a little loud and the TV's should have had closed captioning in the bar area so those who wanted to see the game could read more details.  I asked the bar tender to help with closed captioning and he said he would ask the manager however this man was too busy trying to go home and talk with other staff so he could not be bothered.  It was overall strange the place was so empty.  I was the only one at the bar for almost an hour.  The tables were moderately filled but clearly the place was not doing great business for a Thursday night.  The food could not be the issue, as it was delicious.  Looks like it would be a great place for groups"}
{"text":"Wonderful and knowledgable service from the wait staff! Definitely try their penne bolognese and tiramisu, it is to die for. The pasta is made fresh in house and is served with freshly grated parmesan. Recommend making a reservation beforehand though, as their location in the heart of downtown Toronto can result in long wait times. One con is that it can get loud and sometimes you'll have to yell to have a conversation. Overall, a great place to enjoy good old fashioned Italian food!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening, the restaurant was packed but we were seated right away. The atmosphere of the place was the right blend of cozy, swanky and mozzarell-y. Our waitress Krishta(?) was delightful and had great recommendations. Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Recently went to scaddabush to eat with my family. The restaurant was really nice and had a rustic, warm atmosphere. We got a seat near their open kitchen and got to see them bake the pizzas and hand stretch their in house motzerella. Food was good lot of selection on the menu and prices for main courses ranged from 14-30. The service was also friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Not bad. Definitely nothing authentic like you what you would find in Italy, but it is a reasonably Canadianized adaptation to some of the basic Italian necessities. Great easy place for lunch although it's a tad overpriced for the simple food that they serve. If I could give half stars, this place will get 3 1/2 instead of three :-)"}
{"text":"Been to this one for lunch and dinner a few times. Food quality is pretty consistent. Service thou is hit or miss. Average Italian place."}
{"text":"A tavola non si invecchia  (at the table one does not age)
Popping atmosphere and great food"}
{"text":"Came here with a large group of friends and asked the hostess if we'd have to pay a service charge she said no and at the end we got charged a service fee still. Ordered a baked penne carbonara and a charity bread. The pasta was only one size, and was only in a 5 inch diameter plate compared to a small sized pasta which was twice the size. Food overall was okay very small portions and overpriced would not recommend."}
{"text":"One perk of Scaddabush is its ability to accommodate groups of various sizes. The staff were very accomodating to my large group of twenty, and were able to make various adjustments to ensure that everyone was taken care of. The menu has a wide range of pizzas, pastas, and appetizers and luckily have sociable sizes that are optimal for sharing. The pasta was fresh, coming with just the right amount of sauce, with an abundance of vegetable and meat toppings. The pasta had a nice thin crust and a light tomato sauce that did not overwhelm the toppings of the likes of prosciutto, arugula, and mozzarella. As well, the bruschetta came in a large portion, spilling with tomatoes and cheese on a crunchy baguette. I would highly recommend ordering the house-made mozzarella which had an authentic taste and texture. Overall, the food was quite good, and as was the service. Most notably, Scaddabush' most unique quality is not its take on Itallian food, but rather its ability to provide a nice night out and quality service to large groups."}
{"text":"I had high expectations of this place but my food came out a bit like it was set there for some time before it came out and the service sucks!!! We we're looking for our server to order drinks with our meal and she was nowhere to be found. We didn't even enjoy our food because by the time we were done our food she shows up asking how everything is. We couldn't even have drinks with food. So you're into hot meals and good service this isn't the place to go."}
{"text":"This is NOT italian food. I feel like anyone who rates this place well obviously has never had good pasta.  After having been to italy several times and having mouth watering ravioli in paris, I can assure you that Scaddabush is does not know good food.

I had the zucca ravioli (Butternut squash ravioli, grated Grana Padano cheese, hazelnut butter cream sauce, fried sage, poor man's Parmesan ). Yes, I know it sounds amazing, but it was not even close to that.  Not only was it cold when it was served but it was also HARD (not in the al dente sense).  They claim they make their pasta fresh in house daily and honestly after my dinner here last night I find that a little hard to believe because the pasta did not seem fresh to me.  

Please do not come here. ever."}
{"text":"S'aaaaaaallll right.... Super hype for this place but I found it okay only.
We tried the mozzarella, and half of the group loved it.. i found it - okay. no big deal.
The drinks were delicious and the lobster pasta was delicious. 
A+ for presentation and atmosphere, B- for food and C- for price."}
{"text":"Terrible service, food was disgusting, busers looked like they wanted to leave and have nothing to do with anything. Waitied 30 minutes for first order and food was absolute terrible. Rather eat mcdonald's leftover week old fries with a bit of ketchup"}
{"text":"It's a bit pricey for the bland food offered. The waitress and hostess were both friendly and provided good service."}
{"text":"I came on a Wednesday night with 8 of my out of town family members. It was a rainy night with the Blue Jays in town but the wait for a table was no longer than 20 minutes - as they had stated. 

We sat down and looked at the menu waiting for a server but no one came. When I finally flagged him down he came to take our drinks order down but didn't know the specials. We wanted the beer special and he said there was none for the day - I had to show him on the menu that there was indeed a beer special. After ordering drinks, it took him quite some time to come back and order our food. 

We ordered the mozzarella ball, a salad, 2 large social pastas, and a pizza. All of which came on time, but he wasn't around when it came to fill up our waters, get another round of drinks, and give us our bill. We spent over $250 that night with poor service. I wasn't vocal about it because I was with family but the service here is poor. I will not be returning. The only thing saving this from a one star is the food was pretty decent."}
{"text":"Will you do the fandango? Ok, bad Bohemian Rhapsody pun. 

Well here is a very good example of a restaurant that started with strong food and service and has slipped in both categories. We went for the last time the other day. 

Here is a place that is always busy and is filled with passive aggressive servers. 

The food has lost its portioning, and is suitable for people with small stomachs. 

The seating arrangement, especially if you have kids, is always, always right beside the kitchen, so this means that you have every single server walking by you multiple times. We honestly felt like we were in a cafeteria. 

This place is a perfect example of creating a rustic and seemingly cheap atmosphere and charging excessive prices in a hectic environment. 

To pay  so much for a meal and be met with all these negatives is literally flushing money down the toilet. 

People with kids want decent pricing, large portions, good service and to be able to be seated in calmer atmospheres."}
{"text":"I've been to scaddabush many times before but this was my first time at this location. The quality of food was the same, the only difference was the service. We came as a big group, of about 15. We reserved ahead of time, and still had to wait 30 minutes. Then we didn't get waited until 20 mins after we were seated. It was a big juggle of a day. 

All the food and whatnot came pretty quick, and again everything was really yummy. The pastas are phenomenal and so is They do give out birthday brownies for special events."}
{"text":"We went for lunch as the family was craving pizza and pasta. Unfortunately what we ate was far from rustic and far from authentic Italian food. It was a poor man's imitation of Italian cuisine. The restaurant lacks the small touches that most real Italian restaurants offer patrons. No fresh bread is brought to the table. We had to ask our server for fresh parm on the pasta but any real Italian restaurant would routinely offer cheese. When we asked for hot peppers we got dried pepper flakes. Yuck. 

Surprisingly  the restaurant was quite busy so clearly most people can't tell the difference between real and American style Italian food. I can't believe people are willing to pay the crazy prices charged here for this food. Next time we would drive west to Vaughan for real Italian food- just wish more of our favourite authentic Italian places opened for lunch on Sundays rather than only do private functions. Even Fratacellis is far better than this place.  

The Mario pizza was ok but nothing to write home about. It arrived warm and not hot. The Tuscan salad was mediocre and slightly too vinegary from the pickled onions. Our kids had the spaghetti and meatballs. The food is cooked with an abundance of garlic. This is probably to mask the lack of real authentic flavours. While they purport to make fresh pasta it comes over cooked and mushy. We would not return again. If you like American style Italian food and are looking to pay unreasonably high prices for this food this is your place."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband on a Friday night right before 7pm. We were surprised at how easy it was to find a parking spot (I hate parking at this plaza), and we were able to get a seat right away. It might have been because it was Black Friday, and everyone else was still busy shopping. When we left at around 830, there was a line up at the door.

The food was pretty good and I would give it a 4/5. We ordered the calamari and parmesan chicken bites for appetizer. I really enjoyed both dishes, and would definitely order them again the next time I come back. I loved the salsa verdi aioli that comes with the calamari. For our mains, we had the baked carbonara and spaghetti with stuffed meatballs. Both dishes were good, but I've definitely had better home made pasta from other Italian restaurants. The meatball was very good, and I'm glad we opted for the stuffed option. It was with stuffed with cheese and pepperoni, which was really yummy. The portions are pretty good. This was too much food for the two of us. We were able to finish both the apps, but had to pack some of the pasta home. Most of their pasta come in three sizes - small, regular and social which is meant for sharing. So next time, I would probably order just a small pasta.

The only negative of the meal was the service. Our waitress was nice, but maybe she was new, as there were a couple mess ups throughout the night. Right after we placed our order, the calamari came out within about 2 minutes. We at first were very impressed with how fast they were, but then realized it was probably meant for another table. When our waitress saw that we got the calamari so quick, she came over and asked if we had ordered it, and looked like she was about to take it away until we told her that we did order it. Then 10 minutes later, another waiter came out with our chicken bites and calamari, and was about to put both down on our table, until we told him that we already got the calamari. A few minutes later, another waiter came by and put some garlic bread down on our table. I assumed that this was just the complimentary bread from the restaurant, and ate a slice. Then our waitress came by again and asked us if we had ordered the bread (which we didn't), and then told us that the bread was an item from the menu and was for another table. Anyways, since we didn't know and already took a few slices, they gave it to us for free. After we were done eating, we called our waitress over and asked her to pack our left overs, and get the bill. We also told her that we had a coupon to use, and wanted to give it to her, but she didn't take it. Then we realized she must have blocked out everything we said after we asked for the bill, because a few minutes later, she came back with the bill without the discount on it. Anyways, she took the bill back with the coupon. Then around 10 minutes later, she came back again and asked if we needed to use the POS machine, in which I replied that she never gave us the updated bill. Eventually, everything was sorted out. Hopefully, the next time I come back, this won't happen again!"}
{"text":"I did not know that Scaddabush rebranded from the old Alice Fazoolis but they are doing a great job so far! The food and selection provide a good value to the cost. I ordered the \"baked carbonara\" as I love carbonara.. and i thoroughly enjoyed the flavours..at first the portion didn't look like it would fill me up but it did! It comes with a fried egg on top too. I tried my friends' pasta and also a sandwich and their food was tasty as well. Pretty good for a chain restaurant. The stuffed meat ball wasn't as wow as I'd hope for but apparently the cheese is a must order next time. Will be making a return visit but probably at a different location as service could have been better."}
{"text":"Although I've only been here once, I would definitely say this is the best Italian place i have ever been to thus far!

Let me get the two negative things out of the way:
1. There are a lot of other restaurants in this plaza, so it is very difficult to find parking, especially on a weekend. You may actually need to follow people coming out of the restaurant to get a parking spot! 
2. You should also make a reservation ahead of time as i heard the wait time can be a few hours long!

Let me start with the atmosphere! It is extremely lively and beautiful. Although some may think that the the ceiling looks as if its still under construction, i think it just adds to the vibe. 
The food is spectacular! We started with the Bomba Burrata and words cant describe how scrumptious it is, it takes mozzarella to a whole other level. I had the lobster spaghetti and i was mind blown. It had the perfect amount of spice, sauce and lobster.  No complaints! I also like the fact that you have the option to order a plate or a bowl. We had ordered 2 bowls as there were 8 of us.
The chocolate toffee jar cake is to die for. I have also heard that the tiramisu is really good, but i was stuffed and did not have room for that. I would definitely try it the next time.


Would I go back? YES, YES, YES!"}
{"text":"Scaddabush makes by far the most delicious mozzarella I've ever had, I would highly recommend it. I also really enjoyed the Capri pasta which was an authentic flat egg noddle fettuccine with assorted seafood. The calamari was a great finger food to share and the pizzas were generously topped.

My overall experience was commendable - friendly service, fancy ambiance, and delicious food. My only complaint would be the slightly slower than usual service of food."}
{"text":"I really enjoy scaddabush as it's mine and my girlfriends go to place when we can't decide what we want to eat.

We usually order two pastas and one pizza ... and always one tiramisu which is amazing.

Their food never disappoints and fits our budget really well. None of it is out of this world (the tiramisu is close), but the food is very satisfactory.

It tends to have a nice ambience and enough room for us to just have a good night casual night out."}
{"text":"Do I miss Alice Fazooli's- Yes
Do I resent Scaddabush for opening- No!

Really good choices- however I did find meatball to be over-rated. Was nothing special at all. A bit dry to be honest.

My pasta in an alfredo pesto was delicious. you could taste the thickness in the pasta and realize that the dough was being hand made in the back and fresh processed linguine.

Was a real treat!"}
{"text":"I've been to his location multiple times, and frankly expected a bit better this time. Made a reservation for 3 at 6:45 pm and was seated promptly. Normally the plaza starts to fill up for parking, but I was lucky to get a spot nearby. 

Luck of the draw, but we were seated directly beside a company event, so at times it got a bit loud. Ordered the prosciutto mozzarella and the shrimp spaghetti (social size) for everyone to share. The mozzarella was actually a nice mixture, with cheese, bread, prosciutto, salt and jam. I wish the mozzarella became more of the focus of the combination. It was a bit hard to cut and chew, and most of the taste was centred around the jam and prosciutto. At 17.33, it is reasonable, as each person had about two servings of the bread to go along with the other toppings. Good as a shareable. 

The pasta was a tad disappointing. First impression: it was really small. I expected a social size (their largest) to adequately feed at least two, but it seemed like one person could finish it. At least there was a lot of shrimp and the sauce was a nice thickness. I found it a bit salty but overall the taste was alright. At 38.90 though, it didn't really seem worth it. Maybe we would have been better off ordering a smaller pasta along with a pizza. 

Service was positive on the most part, always checking on us to see how the food was. It was a bit slow at times, but not a huge concern. We had a card for $15 off $50, so the total cost per person was not sky high, but we left feeling a bit hungry. 

I have had better experiences previously so maybe I will return if they have the cash card promotion again."}
{"text":"All I have to say is...their fresh moz! It's so good. We got the prosciutto one. It came with crustinis, fig jam, and prosciutto. I'd go back just to eat that!"}
{"text":"This place was a total joke!! First they advertise Gluten Free on their website but they could not accommodate any of my friends needs. My friend had to go to another restaurant to get food that she could eat. At the end of the night the manager Crystal told me that we were lucky they let her bring in outside food!  Very unprofessional and the food was mediocre at best! Would not recommend this place purely for the customer service. With all that being said, it was our servers first night and he tried really hard to make our experience good!"}
{"text":"Omg! How I love this place! 

Seriously the cutest decor in a restaurant ever! From the chandeliers to the bike hanging from the ceiling to the glass mirrors on the walls, it was pinterestly-decorated lol. 

Our server was amazing. They made suggestions as it was our first time ever going there. 

We tried the fresh mozzarella, which is made fresh daily. There is actually an area where you can watch them make it. How cool is that? We ordered the fresh mozzarella Burrata which was mozzarella infused with honey and truffle cream. It tasted so fresh. That's the word I'm gonna use. Fresh. For appetizer, we tried the crispy polenta tots. Do not not order this. The tots were nice and crispy but inside was nice and smooth and moist. The Sunday sauce with the Parmesan aioli were so delicious. For my entree, I wanted to try their pasta so I got the chicken Parmesan. The chicken was okay but the fresh spaghetti and sauce made up for it. 

Really great dining experience!"}

Scaddabush gives off a dark, casual ambience. 

What I enjoyed:
- Prosciutto fresh mozzarella - this was soooo good. Mozzarella made fresh. The app was sweet, salty and savoury from the prosciutto, bread, and jam. We really loved this app!
- Butternut squash ravioli - I enjoyed the different texture in this dish. It has a nice crunch from the walnuts, not too sweet, and was savoury from the sauce. 
- Toffee cake 

OK dishes:
- butcher pizza - on the drier side, and I was not a fan of the crust. Lots of toppings on the pizza though.
- tartufo - meh 

I thought our meal was a bit pricey. Good service. I would probably only come back for the fresh mozzarella which I thought was the star of our meal."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!!!! I seriously love this place - I love the decor, if you are fan of rustic feels. This place will make you go gaga on alot of their decor. They have different chairs per table, apparently they were collected from an antique store, that's why the chairs are all different. How neat is that? 

Services was excellent, the food was great. I love pasta and they have delivered the pasta I've been longing for. I got the meatballs and spaghetti.. they have HUGEEEEEE meatballs! I eat alot and I barely finished my plate.  

I didn't have any more room for the dessert. But I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! I had my Bachelorette Party in Toronto and my maid of honor chose this restaurant. We couldn't have been happier with her choice. 

They offer fresh, homemade mozzarella and pasta- what could go wrong with that? The cocktails were also amazing!

From the atmosphere, decor, service, food...it was all fantastic. I'm actually quite surprised by a lot of ratings with 3 stars or less for this restaurant. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The first fresh mozzarella ball she did was for the Burrata cheese which was a popular one out of the fresh mozzarella selections but it was spicy.  Christal and I opted for the Naked Fresh Mozzarella this time since we had never had this before.  We watched her make the one for our table as well.

That was a very quick and fun experience.

We were told that we could cut the mozzarella with a knife and then eat it with the San Marzano tomato jam, sea salt, and focaccia crostini.  I found that putting everything together with the mozzarella made it taste good.  The fresh mozzarella was quite chewy and definitely fresh!  This was my first time having fresh mozzarella."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here on a Tuesday night before a concert. Despite a full restaurant (pre jays game crowd) our drink and food came out quick and was well prepared. 

I had the beet salad and spaghetti with a fresh mozzarella ball with added Italian sausage, which was quite good. My GF had a pizza with arugula which she was really happy with as well. 

I also highly recommend the pistachio sour 

I'd certainly go back before a game or concert."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!! Service was great! Food was amazing!! Baked carbonara is a must try and their mozzarella was goooood! The show kitchen is open and you can just sit by it and watch them make fresh mozzarella. Me and my friend went up. The chef was nice and even gave us sample to try!!"}
{"text":"Visited here Wednesday,  my second time.  Ordered the Sofia (came recommended) and the lobster spaghetti (reg size) to share with a friend. Total was 57 after taxes and tip. The pizza was just ok. The chicken was a bit dry and the caramelized onions were clumped in a single area. The size is standard for the price with it being a chain restaurant. The spaghetti was good, but the lobster was non existent.  I think my friend and I each had a small piece of lobster. For $28, not worth it. The service was a bit slow for our table of 8. The server was really nice and the atmosphere was nice, but overall the food was just ok."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful.  Service was horrible.  Our waitress took our drink and food order, brought us our drinks and then clocked out.  The new waitress, who was also the bartender (Sam-a female) brought us our food and walked off.  My husband had to fetch us salt and an extra fork.  The next time she came over was to take out plates.  She quickly asked how our dinner was and before we could answer, she was walking off.  Never got a smile out of her or a thank you.  Meanwhile our original waitress was sitting 4 feet from us, having a beer and gossiping while she cut her eyes at me. Weird experience, never again. You"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with this place we came 2 hours before closing there was no one to greet us at the front or to even show us to a table. The DJ at the front told us to find a waitress/waiter at the bar to get a seat. When we finally got our seats theres was no one to bring us the menus or water, the waiter finally remembered that we were there about 5 minutes of waiting and constant trying to get his attention. Theres no excuse for the service to be this slow because the place was pretty much empty for a thursday night.

The wait time on our food took forever we waited about 20 minutes for our appetizers to come, we got the bomba mozzarella and a caesar salad. We wanted to use the small side plates but as soon as we lifted one of them there was someones left over food stuck to the bottom. The mozzarella was delicious but the \"in house fresh croutons\" for the salad was horrible. It was not crunchy or crispy but oily, chewy and soggy. It just tasted old and nasty. We waited about 15. More minutes for our mains to arrive. We got the steak and fries and the carbonara. The carbonara was little on the bland and dry side. My steak that i request for a medium rare was cold and came out to be raw. At this point we wanted to leave because of the horrible food and lack of service. We packed our left over pasta and steak and went home. 

But to finish the day off when we my boyfriend and i got home both of us got stomach aches. My brother who was feeling fine that night finished the left overs that we brought home. He then vomited a few hours later.

It was my boyfriends first time at Scaddabush and i was pretty disappointed and embarrassed for that i suggest to come here for dinner. Disappointed with the lack of service/attention, cleanliness of the place and bad food that made us all sick."}
{"text":"I was craving for some fresh mozzarella cheese and I love the Burrata-infused with honey and truffle cream foccacia crostini. $14.27 This goes well with a nice glass of white.

We ordered the meatball, pizza, calamari, and ceasar salad. These items tasted good, but nothing to write home about. 

The pizza when they served, it's neat as they attach it to a pair of scissors and you can cut it. Overall, I like the venue and service. Great fresh mozzarella!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with a big group, we had reservations for 12 people at 6 o'clock and arrived at 5:50. We waited for half an hour to be seated even though we had reservations. We expressed our concerns to the hostess Rebecca who served us drinks as she found us a table, she then compensated us with wonderful appetizers. Once we ordered our dinner all of our orders were amazing. Compared to the other locations I've gone to, the service at this location surpasses them all! We will definitely be coming back here again"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular customer at scaddabush but recently the quality and service has been going down the drain. 
We went out for appetizers and drinks, and ordered the artichoke and spinach dip and the naked mozzarella, unfortunately the bread was drenched in butter and inedible. In addition our order was messed up and we were given the honey and balsamic mozzarella instead of the naked one which did not taste good at all. Lastly we ordered a social caesar salad but the croutons were also drenched in butter and the salad has way too much garlic. 
In the past Scaddabush had delicious food but after this bad experience I don't think I'll be going back again"}
{"text":"Chose this place for my mom's birthday. 

It was a sunday evening and packed. Luckily we had reservations. So I highly recommend you make them on the weekend otherwise you will be like the rest of the people lining up and waiting for a table.

Atmosphere seems similar to Alice Fazoolis (which was the previous restaurant before it became Scaddabush).  They kept the rustic feel and now have an open Kitchen. 

Our waiter was named Joe. He was very attentive and fast with getting our orders. But he forgot my hot water with lemon slices as I was cold. I couldn't drink anything else on the menu since I'm preggo and water was just what I needed.  The rest of our table ordered cocktails and they got their drink except me :(    Anyway, not a big deal.

The menu was a good selection.  I recommend the Lobster pasta and the cheese as appies. 

Overall, the place was great, the service was good and the atmosphere was noisy but fun.  Great for families and large groups of friends."}
{"text":"Went here for my bday with the fam. Overall service was good, but the food took forever to come out. They were busy, but our order wasn't that complicated. Pasta and pizza mostly.  Overall I like the atmosphere, but I think they are a tad on the pricey side for what they offer in terms of food quality. I still prefer the pasta at Grazie, which also costs less."}
{"text":"Hair in the bread but good pasta. 

Have been to the Scuddabush in Mississauga and enjoyed it.  

First walked in and place had a lot of open seats but they tried to seat us in a table for two.   We suggested something to fit all of us.  

So we tried the charity bread. It's a butter soaked square of what seems like a few day old bread but some reason popular.   I am sure the hair I found under the last piece soaking in the butter wasn't so popular.     

Waitress \"got it out of our way\" when told.  

Spaghetti and meatball was good , other meals at the table were chicken parm and a pizza which I believe we're well received.  

He big moment came with the bill and the bread was on it right at top so I didn't miss it.  I was speechless and my guest were embarrassed when I wanted to say something so I paid the bill and the bread against my better judgement."}
{"text":"At the recommendation of my Canadian colleague, we enjoyed a very nice business dinner here. We arrived just past 6 PM on a Thursday evening. The bar was packed, and with the DJ spinning modern techno tunes, had a really energized vibe to it. Our group, mostly 50-somethings, were really taken by it. We enjoyed a couple glasses of wine while we waited for our 7:00 reservation.

The fare here is Italian, and they offer many of the classic Italian dishes one would expect, including Sunday spaghetti & meatball, chicken parmesan, penne bolognese and so many others. We started with a selection of appetizers, including their famous stuffed meatball (an Italian meatball stuffed with pepperoni and fresh mozzarella cheese), calamari, and raw cheese. All were delicious and prepared our palate for what would turn out to be an outstanding meal. One of my colleagues chose the wine, so I did not peruse the wine list. He selected the Buried Hope cabernet sauvignon from California's north coast; I've never heard of it and I'm not sure why, as it is one of the better cabs I've had in a long time. I plan to check my local Spec's to see if they carry it.

I was torn between the penne bolognese and the spaghetti with meatball and Sunday sauce. At our servers recommendation I chose the latter, and boy, was he right! This was one of the better meatballs I've tasted and the Sunday sauce (a traditional deep red tomato sauce) was perfectly seasoned and quite flavorful. One of my colleagues opted for the bolognese and ate every bite - certainly a testimony to his enjoyment of the meal.

Although the place was busy, we were never rushed, and we lingered after dinner to finish our wine and enjoy some quality conversation. The TVs were showing a curling tournament, and our Canadian hosts explained the rules and strategy of the game to us as we finished our beverages. If there was any lingering doubt that we were, in fact, in another country, the curling tournament definitely put those to rest.

What a great recommendation this was. If you enjoy Italian food and lively atmosphere check this place out. I recommend making a reservation. Cheers!"}
{"text":"A nice open concept restaurant (can see the cooking). With dim lights and candles throughout the restaurant. The servers were exceptionally friendly and checked in on us regularly.

Tried the house made mozzarella, stuffed meatballs, calamari and lobster pasta.

 I wouldn't mind repeating most, except for the lobster pasta. Found it lacking in lobster meat."}
{"text":"This is one helluva a Italian restaurant and one of my favs. It has the perfect ambience, very friendly staff and the food is just outstanding. 

The menu is varied and extensive. The service was great. The decor of the restaurant was pretty cool and sporty.

We ordered osso bucco bites, shrimp spaghetti and spaghetti with meatball. 
I generally am not too fond of pork but their osso bucco bites had me wanting for more. It was that good. Portion sizes were massive too and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The one in downtown is way better. Food was below average, pasta was overlooked. I asked for a virgin drink but I could tell on my first sip that there was alcohol in it. I told the waiter and he just took it away. Still got charged for something they made an error on. Oh well, there are so many better places to go. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"I had a seriously good time here. I think this is my new favourite!! 

From beginning to end our visit was fantastic. It all started with the gorgeous restaurant the second we walked in. The decor is VERY cozy bring dim-lit with gothic chandeliers but a chic modern classic look that is very Italian, down to the side plates and cutlery wrapped in linen on the table, and even the mismatched chairs which brought so much character. I loved the experience from the second we walked in. I'm glad we came on a Sunday night because it wasn't busy at all, we were promptly seated by the friendly staff at a lovely table and ordered some starters right away.

We got the mozzarella to try (obviously, it's an absolute staple) and it was DELICIOUS. I am not sure of the name but we got the one with honey glazed and truffle oil and I was absolutely in love. The bread was warm and freshly warmed with some olive oil and the cheese tasted amazing and was so fun to eat because of the do-it-yourself arrangement. I can't wait to try them all. 

I then got the grilled cheese and prosciutto sandwich which came with 3 freshly grilled cheese sandwiches loaded with fig jam, prosciutto, and arugula and a Caesar salad on the side. I loved it! Very fresh and the flavours played very nicely with the fig jam.

I also ordered the side of fries that are tossed with rosemary, truffle oil, and garlic parmesan. Absolutely INCREDIBLE. It's only $3.97 and you're crazy if you don't try them.

My partner got a margherita pizza which was delicious and beautiful, and came with convenient snippers to slice it up quickly and easily. He also got a nice passionfruit and peach cocktail which had a great tart flavour to it.

We ended the night with some dark chocolate ice cream which was, as you can assume by now, lovely in it's simplicity.

The best part of the night was the bill total, I totally thought I'd be spending at least double what I did. Always a pleasant surprise :) and of course our server Sonya was also great.

I will definitely be running back soon!!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and the first time my pizza was too salty.  Second and third time I made sure I asked for less salt.  Overall the food just okay.  Service was great.  I've had the pizzas and also their spaghetti and meatballs.  Their pizzas are long shaped and served with pizza cutting scissors.  But I think the spaghetti and meatballs is the best.  You get one big meatball"}
{"text":"Came for a group dinner on St Patty's. Immediately, you will notice how large this place is, making it the perfect spot for larger group meals. We ordered the special St. Patty's sangria pitcher, spinach artichoke dip and the classico and avocado/goat cheese bruschetta to share. Normally, I'm not the biggest fan of bruschetta, but Scaddabush does an excellent job - I highly recommend the avocado goat cheese bruschetta! I did not have the opportunity to try the dip since it was gone in a heartbeat, but can only assume it was great as well. The sangria was also bomb.

For my main, I had the margherita pizza. My favourite part by far was the mozzarella, which is freshly made in house. The crust was a bit too thick for my preference. At $16, I was excited I had enough left over for a second meal.

I would most definitely visit for avocado bruschetta again!"}
{"text":"Great service. We had the charity bread with cheese which was really good. Meatball sandwich was alright but not outstanding. Tomato soup was delicious. I would return but certainly wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Food was standard with the other Scaddabush locations but service was poor. 

We ordered several dishes for the table; the charity bread, a spring salad, the fettuccini capri, and spaghetti with meatball.

The charity bread was not warm, the cheese was cold already. Disappointing compared to the downtown locations. 
The spring salad was standard. 
The pastas were cooked well (al dente) and the small size was plenty for one person - I took home nearly half for dinner. 

Rude service. Server was clearly not interested in being there. Practically threw the drinks down on the table before dashing away - and not because the restaurant was busy, it was practically empty. 

Probably would not visit this location again."}
{"text":"Don't let my picture fool you, the portion was tiny!!!

I got the Baked Penne Carbonara for $17.49, which was the regular size. I was still hungry after eating here, I went home to eat again. There was barely any bacon/meet on it too.

I know the pasta is supposed to be made fresh everyday, but you could've fooled me. No different than the pasta from a bag. And the sauce? Tastes like I can make the same thing from a can.

The atmosphere was cool at least, but definitely a scam for pasta."}
{"text":"Food was good wasn't enough in terms of what your paying for pasta was semi fresh not 100% like they claim... there was so little sauce which made the pasta dry this is not real authentic Italian food you want real Italian go to Italy...  have a wonderful time would I recommend yes and know depends if you want pasta or not but they are not traditional Italian"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch with two of my friends. The server was nice and friendly but there were a few blunders with our order. We requested for a coffee but we were served an Americano. The sugar we requested with the coffee was served almost when the coffee was over. The server did replace the Americano, with a coffee but got a cup that was half full. One of the entree was the pesto pasta with the request for a vegetarian one. The regular order comes with chicken. The server acknowledged the request, but only to serve a pasta with chicken!!! Both the errors caused due to a miscommunication with our waitress and the server. The quality of the food was"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner three times now. I don't like many chain restaurants but this one is quite good. Their name is fun to say too.

Scaddabush is part of the Service Inspired Restaurants that include Jack Astors, Canyon Creek, REDs, etc. I think they just rebranded Alice Fazoolis that was at this location few years ago. They are still very similar but the rebranding and the addition of fresh mozzarella made daily and other menu options are highly welcomed changes, since I found Alice a bit boring.

The mozzarella is made to order, but only available certain hours (dinner time usually), try to get that if you can as an app. Stretchy delicious cheese. I've tried two varieties of it, burrata and bomba burrata, and they were both good although a little expensive for the amount. 

I also like their giant stuffed meatballs on top of pasta or on its own. The carbonara pasta is great, served with an egg on top, and delivered on a hot skillet pan. Also I tried garlic fries and crispy polenta tots, both decent sides. They come around offering to add parmesan cheese to any dish. Can't get enough.

Apple ravioli (pie) with ice cream was an okay dessert. Kinda small. The ice cream melted too quickly due to the hot apple pies, as expected.

They have great service here! Also nice decor with TVs. Usually they play music but during the last big sports game, we requested audio to be changed to the game since it seemed like all patrons were watching. The server did her best and made it happen. Would definitely come back when craving Canadianized Italian food."}
{"text":"I had pretty high expectations coming to the restaurant because I heard such good things about it from my friends. But I was quite disappointed.

Being a lover of all things garlic-y and butter-y, of course we ordered the charity bread. It was exactly how I imagined it would taste- delicious and full of garlic flavour. It was really soft and fluffy on the inside. On the downside though, I found it to be way too oily.

We also ordered the fresh Buretta Mozzarella. We were seated right in front of the chefs table, so we got to see our cheese being made, which was cool! In terms of taste, the cheese was really good when it was warm, and had a touch of sweetness to it. It also paired really well with the crispy focaccia crostini. I do love cheese, but since there were only two us, we found it to be pretty heavy and filling after a while. I would recommend ordering the mozzarella only if you have a party of 3 or more people to share it with! 

Lastly, we tried the Mario Pizza (because who doesn't love prosciutto and arugula on pizza?). I was quite disappointed with this dish, as the pizza dough was way too thick and hard, so a lot of chewing was required. Overall, the pizza was quite bland- it would've been nice if the prosciutto was more savoury.

The service was slow. I would've preferred it if all our food had come out around the same time, but they came out one after the other. Probably won't come back to this location. I do still want to try their baked carbonara and giant meatballs, so hopefully my experience will be better at the downtown Toronto location!"}
{"text":"So I came here for dinner 2 nights ago. I usually make a reservation for this place as they do get busy even on a week night. So I was seated at a table by the kitchen. Oh my, this view is excellent where I get to see all the yummy food being prepped. So setting is excellent to start off the evening. 

Food wise. My friend and I ordered a Sophia pizza and a zucca ravioli. I ordered a regular sized ravioli and the server was very kind to recommend us to split into 2 plates. Not long after, the ravioli arrived and wow. The taste had different layers to it. The sauce was creamy yet not too heavy and the ravioli was sweet and not over powering. Then the moment of the night came. The server said our pizza will be late because they had to remake it from scratch cause it didn't meet their quality standard. I was quite amazed by that. So about 20 mins later the pizza emerges from the kitchen. And not to disappoint, it came out piping hot. Flavour wise, it's not over powering with the cheese. Chicken and veggie tasted just right. 

I have to give 5 stars for both the service attitude the server provided and the food came out perfect."}
{"text":"I visited Scaddabush with my family for a birthday tonight. Whereas the food was delightful, the service we received was unfortunately quite disappointing. To begin with, the quality of the food measured up well to their prices, and the taste is comparable to other Italian restaurants. It definitely left me no room to complain. 

The whole aesthetic of the restaurant is really nice with the wooden mismatch chairs and tables, but our table was too small for a group of 6, making it really chaotic between dishes, some of which our server did not even take away.

On top of that, the servers seemed to be busy even with half the restaurant empty. We finished eating at around 8pm (keep in mind that the restaurant closes at midnight) but the tables around us, who left over an hour before, were still covered in untouched, dirty dishes. Our server in particular seemed rather absent minded with the number of times we had asked for takeout boxes before he went off to do something else and forgot about our request. For the birthday, we had brought in a cake that we bought from outside for them to bring out when we finished our meals. When he brought us the cake, however, our table was still littered with our empty plates. If it wasn't for us stacking up our plates and utensils, we would not have had space to even place the cake, let alone eat it with utensils that we had to fetch ourselves.
Service was kind and friendly, but I have to say that with my experience there tonight, it was very inefficient and inconvenient."}
{"text":"If you park on the side of the restaurant (there's a blue painted line in the middle of the parking lot), then it's free.

The fresh Mozzarella Balls are insanely good. I love the BOMBA. 

Foodwise, I haven't had anything else here that I love. I've been to the downtown location twice and this was my first time at this one. I don't remember what I got at the other location, but only the fresh mozzarella impressed me. More or less, I assume the foods taste the same at both locations. 

I liked that the Diavolo pizza was flatbread styled, but I wasn't impressed by the flavour. It wasn't spicy either - more so overpowering vinegary balsamic. 

The Blood Orange Bellini did not taste like Blood Orange at all, but I mean, it's still an drink you can easily down. 

The Espresso Martini is always a good choice at most places. Tasted like an ice coffee. I also loved that it came with a biscotti. It was like $8 as a special - so that was a nice treat. 

We sat in the bar section at a high top and the server was not very present. However, it should be considered that it looked like we were on a date. Very average service, more or less. 

3.5 experience - I can get the espresso martini elsewhere too. I'd only come back for the Mozzball!"}
{"text":"Scaddabush: a place that is as fun to say as it is to eat in. Where else do you get to cut your own pizza with shears and reminisce on kindergarten arts & crafts? Having been disappointed by its overpriced predecessor Alice Fazooli time and time again, I am very pleasantly surprised!

The most important thing is the food. Wow, I've got to say, I am definitely impressed with all the flavours in their dishes. My boyfriend and I started with the Burrata, a mozzarella ball infused with honey truffle oil served with crispy bread. It was such a unique flavour profile, with the delicate sweetness of the honey mixing with the slight saltiness of the cheese. What a great way to start a meal. They're also very proud of the fact that their mozzarella balls are freshly made in-house and you can sit and watch/interact with the chefs making it. 

Then came the entrees. We got the shrimp spaghetti and butcher pizza. The pizza is an ordinary meat pizza. Not that it is bad, just nothing special. But the shrimp spaghetti!!! It was lemony, creamy, briny, and just plain delicious. There was an ample amount of shrimp and there were these crunchy little bits on top that just added great texture. Did I mention they have sizes for the pasta? For someone who doesn't have the biggest appetite for a boatload of pasta and cream, this is perfect!

For dessert, we settled for the raspberry and chocolate tartufo. Again, good but nothing special. Tasted like fruity chocolatey sorbet with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. 

In my opinion, Scaddabush completely succeeds with its quality and flavour combinations. The decor is rustic and cozy, more or less similar to Alice Fazooli's. Service was relatively attentive and quite quick (though we did come on a Tuesday night, during a snowstorm, so there weren't that many people). I am not usually a fan of Italian food, but I am definitely a fan of Scaddabush. What a welcome addition to that cluster of restaurants!

(14/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"I have a thing for fresh pasta.  And Scaddabush does pasta really well.  My favourite is the shrimp spaghettini and the Butternut Squash Ravioli.  

My ultimate favourite is the hand-pulled mozzarella they offer after 5pm each day.  I used to try the naked mozzarella which they offer with tomato jam and sea salt.  But after I tried the prosciutto mozzarella, I couldn't go back.  (This was before I was vegetarian).  The prosciutto mozzarella comes with fig jam, proscuitto and focaccia.  If you don't want to spend the extra 5 dollars for the proscuitto, you can switch out the tomato jam from fig jam for free.  (The fig jam really is the best part).

I wouldn't recommend getting the charity bread however.  Although a donation goes to a good cause, the bread is damp with oil.  You might as well just donate money without getting a bad taste in your mouth.

All in all, Scaddabush is 10/10"}
{"text":"We ordered their stuffed meatball, lobster pasta and Sophia pizza. Everything was delicious! The service was excellent. The waitress was very attentive to our needs. If I had to suggest an area for improvement, I would add a little more sauce to the pasta and meatball."}
{"text":"Had the meatballs and pasta. The meatballs were well seasoned and very tasty. The pasta was undercooked. Definitely not al dente."}
{"text":"It's all right, but other than the homemade bread and cheese dinner kinda sucked bad."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday and there are WAYYY too little servers for the amount of tables they have here. Took us 20 minutes for us to find our server/get her attention to come back to our table just to pay her. Like do you want your tip or not? Food wasn't AMAZING , its good but not \"wow i'm definitely coming back for this\""}
{"text":"Life is really full of unfortunate. This place is a solid 4.5 star, I would've gave it a 5/5 since I can't put half a star on a review (my standard has be lowered when you have Waterloo food for 2 weeks straight. #hell). The food was good, but one of our pasta was serve cold and it was just very upsetting. Although the manager was very kind and quickly made us a new one (when I say quick, it was like 2 minutes), it just doesn't deserve that 0.5. (Hi manager, if you are reading this I know you know who I am. You did great). The food was also very filling, I almost threw up cause I was that full. Give it a try, I can't guarantee if your food will be hot. Good Luck."}
{"text":"Great place to socialize and watch the game. The restaurant is spacious and has 2 areas (bar and dining area). You can really dress up or dress down. This would be the 4th time here, personally I prefer the apps than the mains. The deep friend polentas were great and the stuffed meatball was even better. The meatball was stuffed with pepperoni and cheese. I found that the meatball was not cooked enough as the cheese was not melted. The mozzarella on the other hand was amazing. It is made fresh daily and comes with a baguette and fruity sauce which complemented each other very well. I would strongly recommend to order like tapa style so you can share and try a bit of every thing. I was  a bit disappointed in the pasta coming to an Italian restaurant. I tried the pesto pasta-social style and I found it over cooked and bland. I also try the carbonara and lobster pasta and would not recommend getting any of the pastas. Overall great place to socialize and grab a drink or two."}
{"text":"I think I set my expectations to high. Had a company celebration here and the opening garlic bread followed by salad was pretty good. I preferred the Ceasar salad and their garlic bread was a little too oily.

The main dish portions were a little disappointing. I opted for the chicken parmesan which was alright. Got it topped with some more cheese as they had a giant blob of melted cheese on the chicken only. It wasn't anything special as far as I could tell.

Desert had overwhelming tastes. The wild berry sorbet was a little too sweet and the lemon was quite sour. They were quite generous with the serving, but because of the above many didn't get past the first of four scoops.

My tea never came, but that's fine. Had a green soda (don't recall what it was called) that was refreshing and plenty of water to work with.

Hopefully their regular dine in experience is better than what they offer groups."}
{"text":"I came here with colleagues for a work lunch and really enjoyed my time here. They asked before hand how much time we had available and served us promptly so we wouldn't be late getting back to work. The staff were friendly and attentive.  

The food was really good, the pasta is made fresh in house and was delicious. We ordered some focaccia along with the meal and it was cooked to perfection.  The portions were huge! I ordered a small plate and that was more than enough food for me.  I'd definitely go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Scaddabush is one of my favourite Italian chain restaurants! I've been to both the downtown and the new Richmond Hill location many times. The difference is the service. At this one, I always have a wonderful time. Every server I've had here thus far has been so great that I tend to remember their names. Daniel is really funny! And Stephanie is so nice and sweet. Since I like it so much, I came here again last night for Valentine's Day.

Appetizers: 
Spinach & Artichoke Dip - my personal favourite. I get this at every restaurant I go, but I absolutely love it here! The dip is so flavourful and creamy. It's a must try.
Stuffed Meatball - very good but it's a bit big. We weren't able to finish this, as there was too much meat for me. 

Mains: 
Lobster Spaghetti (social) & Pesto Pollo (small) - I'd highly recommend either of these items under the pastas because they are just so tasty! However, the social size is huge! Probably best for 4 people to share. NOT two. We ordered the social size for one of the dishes with the intention of having a little bit of leftovers to bring for lunch the next day but this was still too much!

Unfortunately, everything came out pretty much all at once, which was what we didn't want. We wanted to pace ourselves and our server, Stephanie, kindly understood and was extremely apologetic about it. She quickly offered to ask the chef to remake certain items and insisted on giving us complimentary drinks and desserts on the house. We loved her positive attitude.

I'd recommend this place to anyone who likes pasta and pizza! But they also have other items if you don't like those. Scaddabush will continue to be one of my regular go-to restaurants."}
{"text":"I came here on a weeknight with a friend and we were seated right away.
Service was fair, but I've experienced much better. I felt that the waitress gave us some attitude at times. When we ordered dessert, I asked which dessert would be the safest for me to eat since I have a nut allergy. The response I got was \"Well I don't have a nut allergy so I'm not sure\". The logical thing to do would have been to ask the chef but instead, just gave us attitude.
I have been here in the past and the food was okay. This time, It was just not good. We started with the focaccia bread with garlic butter. There was so much butter that the bread was essentially drenched in it. I ordered a small size pasta with shrimp and wine cream sauce. I asked beforehand if the sauce was heavy, and the waitress assured me it was not. When the meal came, it was HUGE (definitely not the size of a small order) and it was extremely heavy and oily. I couldn't finish my meal. 
The only upside to this place was the ambiance and atmosphere of the restaurant. There was lots of people which made it a very social outing.
Other than that, I will most likely not be returning."}
{"text":"Went here with my family, we ordered the classic bruschetta to share, which was by far the best bruschetta we had all ever eaten! The tomatoes were very flavourful and the cheese was super fresh. For my main I got the butternut squash ravioli, there were maybe 4 or 5 ravioli which I honestly didn't think would fill me up but I was stuffed! It was not only filling, but delicious. I wish I had the stomach to order 3 more plates ;)"}
{"text":"Poor inattentive service and mediocre food.

Made a reservation for a party of 5 last night. Half the party had already been seated. Once my friend and I finally arrived, we asked the host to show us where our table was. She walked us into one corner of the restaurant but stopped and realized she had no idea where she was going. We awkwardly waited at that spot as we waited for her to come back, but she never did. When we walked back to the entrance, we noticed she was just standing at the host stand, having to forgot about us... We ended up just calling our friends and finding the table ourselves.

Once finally seated and ready to order, our server was no where to be found. We had to flag another server as they were passing us and to ask us for our server. She promptly took our order.

We ordered the prosciutto mozzarella to share. Came with four pieces of bread and three big slices of prosciutto. The fig jam was very good to pair with the mozzarella and prosciutto! 

The main dishes took a while to come out. I ordered a Caesar salad and the seafood pasta. The Caesar salad was very garlicky and nothing too memorable. The seafood pasta came out cold. The mussels were very cold and soggy (almost like they weren't cooked). Didn't finish this meal. Very under whelmed. 

We finished our dinner and we were waiting for the server to come back to ask for the bill. We waited a long time again. We looked and our server was standing in the middle of the restaurant chatting with some other people. My one friend decided to walk to her to get her attention (eeks!!). 

Overall, I would not return to eat at Scaddabush. Their food is very mediocre and the lack of service is enough for me to say, no thanks! :)"}
{"text":"Came here for my girlfriends birthday.   Upon entrance the lady in the front had her arms crossed and did not smile.  But that wasn't going to ruin my night with the girls. 

It was a Sunday evening, the bar area was pretty empty, so she asked if we mind sitting on tall chairs, which we didn't.  We were just hungry.  

We were served by AJ.  Who was very personable, talkative, and busy since it seems like he was the bartender too.  

We ordered the honey and truffle infused fresh mozzarella.  It was pretty unique, was a little sweet, but needed more crostinis, only came with 4 very small pieces.  

Then got a Tuscan salad to share.  This was really good. Very refreshing vinaigrette, crunchy bits on top, mix of Arugula and kale, raisins. Definitely highlight of our meal. 

Next we got the Sophia pizza. The crust was pretty good and chewy, the goat cheese wasn't overpowering, and it came with a pair of scissors which made it very easy to cut into strips for everybody to share. 

We then got pesto Pollo sociable size to share.  It was about $33.00. The server told us it was enough to serve 3-4 people, it was quite a decent portion, but I'm not sure about the price.  The pasta must be fresh since they all stuck together, the chicken breast was a little dry, but the sauce was pretty good. Overall not too bad.  

At the end of the night we wanted to try a dessert, so we got the toffee brownie in a Mason jar.  It was pretty good. The chocolate brownie was nice and fluffy, with crunchy bits on the top.  There wasn't enough toffee, drizzled over the brownie, but that might make it too sweet.  

The meal was pretty good, a little pricey.  But we got great service.  A little disappointed that it didn't come with complementary bread being an Italian cuisine.  I miss that part of Alice Fazooli."}
{"text":"good service here got a free sake cake for a birthday and got a cool sparkler the pesto chicken noodle was a 4/5 could have used some more chicken but good flavour as for the shrimp chicken noodle I would give it a 5/5 really good flavours tangy and juicy tomato. Portions are good and I got the regular size 
the restaurant is v aesthetic and fun place to go on a date 
expect to spend around $25/ person here"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening at 5:30 and the place wasn't busy yet. We had a reservation, though the woman at the front desk was on the phone, one of the servers saw us waiting and he took us to our seats.

Just like expected from other reviews, the staff here are all friendly.

Service is prompt and though the place got busier around 7PM, the service quality didn't change, and our server was always making sure we got what we need. 

Food is good, portions are just a-ok. I ordered the baked carbonara and there was a little bit much pepper than I expected. I expected a bit more creamy sweet sauce.

The place is cozy and inviting, by about 7PM there was a DJ playing good music.

I will come back to try their pizza and desserts as the dessert pictures here on Yelp look yum!

{"text":"I have been to Scaddabush in RH twice and once in the DT location.  All 3 times I had great food and service whether it was their app, pasta, or pizza. I recommend getting the small portion if you are sharing appetizers, cos, well, to me 90% of Italian cuisine is carbs and cheeses. Check out the small vs large portion of the Shrimp Spaghetti as a reference. For those of us who are more health-conscious, the online menu includes nutritious content for each dish.  

Polenta Tots: Had the right mix of corn meal, mascarpone, pancetta, parmesan aioli! 

Fettucini Capri: If you like seafood and long pasta, you can't go wrong with this dish.  

My friend had the Spaghetti & Meatball, and to quote his comments: \"The fried garlic bits in the meatballs do not go too well with the tanginess of the sauce\". But it wasn't bad, the taste was just a bit strange."}
{"text":"My best friend and I came to have dinner on Wednesday night. Low and behold you are now charging for parking much to our surprise. $20.00 for two hours. Sadly we will not be coming to eat at this location any more. To charge people $20.00 before we even get in the door is way over the top. This is Richmond Hill not down town toronto. I can only hope more people think like me and business falls off. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"We came as a family for a dinner while we were at the Convention Center across the street, not the best choice. The food was marginal, not horrible but far from good considering the price point. The service was terrible, not very friendly, not very knowledgeable and borderline rude. When we came  with 3 kids, not kids menu was provided. I had to ask for it, and they still only brought 1. We ordered a social pasta as a gluten free option and were not told it was only penne. When the dinner came, we then had to wait for the plates. After all that, we had to ask for Parmesan. Just seems that there was not much by the way of training. As a family, we were very disappointed with a very expensive meal."}
{"text":"We've passed by this place for quite some time now but have never dropped in to try it out. We were happy we did!  Like other Yelpers and friends, we really liked the house-made fresh mozzarella. We had an early dinner so we couldn't try the honey and truffle cream infused burrata. Instead, we opted for the prosciutto one. It was served with crostini, sea salt, prosciutto and fig jam. The flavours were very nice. 

Our server was bang on with the dish sizes. We explained how we weren't big eaters so she suggested that we order the small size for everything. We had 4 adults and a preschooler.  Our Cesar salad was tasty and not overly dressed which was nice. I dislike those goopy, heavy salads at some restaurants. The lettuce was fresh and crispy (no bitter leaves to be found). 

We also had the pomodoro pizza. Love the scissors that it is served with. Makes cutting a piece to your liking easy. The crust was light and airy and the toppings flavoured just right.  My mother did mention that by the second piece, the crust was overly greasy though and she was right. 

Our pesto chicken pasta was perfectly cooked as well!  We also had a spaghetti with meatball, also yummy. Both pasta dishes had left overs as we were stuffed. 

We will be looking forward to our next visit and hopefully we'll get to try the burrata!"}
{"text":"I went there with friends for dinner without a reservation.  To my surprise, it only took 15 minutes for a table of 4.  We ordered some drinks and the tomato soup to start off. The tomato soup was different from what I have had at other places.  They added cheese and croutons which was a fine balance.

We shared a few dished including pesto pollo penne, fetticcini capri and smoked bacon & egg pizza. All the dishes were nice and shareable. I did not realize on the menu that  the pizza had chillis so opted to just eat 2 slices. The standout was the pizza with the freshly cracked egg on top despite the spiciness.  The pasta were average overall.

The location used to be East Side Marios but they did a good job on the renovations. There are booths as well as a few long tables to cater to larger groups. I usually stay downtown so won't be back anytime soon.  My friend on the other hand goes often as his favorite water hole."}
{"text":"Nice and unique decor.  Been here many times and have left satisfied.  Both food and service is good.  Background music, noise is there but not overwhelming that we need to scream to hold a conversation.  Love the pizza-alway add that in conjunction with another main dish.  TVs are strategically placedin many good spots so I can catch a game while having a decent meal (instead of the bar variety chicken wings).  

I cannot comment on the other locations but the RIchmond Hill is excellent!"}
{"text":"Some out of town guests were craving pasta for lunch so we decided to come here. They make delicious fresh pasta and pizza. Everything tastes fresh. Portions are quite generous, especially the social size which is meant to be shared family style.

We ordered stuffed meatballs and charity bread to share. We also got the fresh mozzarella which was served with sliced toasted focaccia, prosciutto, and fig jam. These were consistently delicious as had been my last experience with these dishes.

We shared social sized portions of the pollo pesto pasta (one of my faves, which we requested to be cooked with penne) and the Capri pasta (fettuccine with assorted types of seafood in a marinara sauce. We also ordered the Sophia pizza with caramelized onions, goat cheese, and chicken. Even between 8 adults, this was a lot of food.

As we were celebrating a birthday, our server was kind enough to bring us a complementary freshly baked chocolate cake in a jar with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. Delicious and not too sweet.

If you're looking for good service and consistent Italian food for reasonable prices, you should definitely give this place a try.

{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place. I've passed by it many times and I finally got a chance! 

The decor was great and the booth seat we were at was by the patio so a gentle breeze wafted in often to cool us off. The server, who is extremely courteous and welcoming, explained the giant meatball and was very patient with my indecisiveness. I must have taken 10 minutes to decide. Honestly, I wanted to try everything, and I still do. 

I got the fettuccini capri, which is a seafood pasta. My bf got the spaghetti and stuffed meatball. My friend recommended me the pasta hence my decision. 

Wow :D stuff tasted super fresh and their pasta is great! Texture is good, and the chewiness was interesting. Despite being fettuccini and spaghetti, it was able to absorb the taste. Also, it didn't break even though I twirled it hard. 

We also had calamari but it came out soggy. We were like ehh but the server came and asked us how it was. I said \"it's.. Alright\". He was immediately concerned and asked what was wrong with  it. I told him and he offered to bring a new calamari free of charge, and apologized profusely for the error. We waited a while and he checked back with us, and we said we don't have it yet. 

He went into the kitchen and got us a brand new dish of calamari that looked and smelled great. It was even tucked into a newspaper cone, which had not been done for our first calamari. He apologized again and said the head chef checked before sending it out. 

Not sure if it's true, but it tasted totally different. 

The customer service was phenomenal here. Thank you, man loop server with a NZ accent! You're splendid."}
{"text":"My husband and I saw this restaurant while walking to a Bluejays game and figured we had to try it. We couldn't stop saying the name--Scaddabush, scaddabush. I believe they said it means, \"A little bit of everything\" in Italian. They should have a little bit more vegetarian food, in my opinion, but I was pleased with my primavera pizza. We also got the balsamic mozzarella as a starter. They make their own mozzarella every day, so you kind of have to try it. It's pretty delicious. We sat at the bar, which is great when there's a game on TV. They have standard beers on tap. Service is decent, though our waitress went off shift and forgot to give us our bill... We did not dine and dash, for the record."}
{"text":"I come here almost 3 times a month and they never disappoint. Although the wait times can be a bit long, its definitely worth it. 
What I usually get: 
- balsamic truffle mozzarella 
- ravioli or carbonara 

I decided to write a review this time around because when I was planning my boyfriends surprise dinner, they met every request that I made and lemme tell ya that list was long. The dinner ended up being a success! 

Overall, reasonably priced, good food, good atmosphere, and good service."}
{"text":"The richmond hill location has the worst service. They leave the tables dirty and we have to wait so long just to get seated. The waiters take a long time to come and take our order and on top of that our food takes forever to come. I have been here so many times and I always leave disappointed."}
{"text":"I think they renovated Alice fazooli and renamed it. We tried the stuffed meatball, lobster spaghetti and the pento pollo? (Chicken pasta). It's ok overall- price is ok as we have a $25. The large portion is slightly bigger than the small portion. I would say small portion is enough for one individual. Tons of lobsters in the lobster spaghetti which is a plus! Will come back again."}
{"text":"Alice fazooli's facelift is absolutely lovely.
Scaddabush, which I didn't even know was a chain, is definitely a place I need to go back to. Now, I rarely crave italian food.. or any 'white' food in general, but I definitely had to go try this new place in the 'hotspot' of that little gap between markham and richmond hill. 

Upon walking in, it's great to see how they've closed up the useless space of the front, where Alice Fazooli's had wasted and you no longer have to walk 2 miles to get to the hostess. Speaking of.. where was the hostess?! Nobody was in sight and I may as well have been invisible because every staff member that looked over, chose to look away. Eventually, the bartender came over and tried to seat us but it was clear it was not his forté, and he led us around the restaurant to 3 potential areas, until deciding on a tall table. These tall tables are small and pretty uncomfortable, but since it was just me and my date, we didn't mind. Our waitress, Steph, came in minutes and she was extremely soft-spoken and friendly. For some reason, listening to her talk just relaxed me- that's how gentle her voice was. (watch her be reading this and feel creeped out.. sorry LOL) She was kind and apologetic towards any wait any table had to endure and definitely a great server.

The menu is typical, with sandwiches/pastas/pizzas, but there are also fresh mozzies made to order at scaddabush, which seems really interesting and I'd definitely like to try it. The pizzas were amazing and they were served like flatbread with a pair of scissors to cut them as you wish. Extremely fresh and cheesy- just the way he likes it. I ordered the bolognese, and I was delighted to see that they served a 'small'!! Not being a common eater of carbohydrates, my body finds it harder to digest wheat (not gluten free though, thank goodness).. anyway, the small was the PERFECT size for me. In fact, it was still a bit too much and I was definitely STUFFED. The pasta was fresh and texturized, which is a good factor, I guess. It also had a lot of flavour! Since this is one of the few restaurants that offer a small portion, I'll definitely be back to try the other pastas!! ...and perhaps the rosemary garlic fries. (Just thinking of that name makes me drool)"}
{"text":"At the recommendation of a friend, I've come here not once but twice in the past month. This place really deserves a 3.5 but I'm rounding it down to a 3 because of general food quality. 

If there's one thing that Scaddabush does well it's their mozzarella balls. Made fresh and in-house by order, these cheesy balls of goodness are a definite must during your first visit here. I've had the burrata mozza and the prosciutto mozza & both come with focaccia crostini bread. If you're more into a sweet and decadent taste, the burrata mozza is for you - it's infused with honey and truffle cream. If you're craving more salty and sweet (and unique), go for the prosciutto mozza. Served with prosciutto, fig jam, extra-virgin olive oil, & sea salt, this one was my favourite. With the burrata I found that if I had too much, I got tired of the flavour and density of all the ingredients. 

During my first visit here, we ordered the pesto pollo fettucine (social size was $34.15). It has a creamy pesto taste which we weren't used to and I'm not sure we liked that much. We'd probably give this dish a 2.5/3 out of 5. Along with the pasta, we ordered their smoked bacon & egg pizza (fun fact: their pizzas are more rectangle/oval-shaped than circular) which we all thought was really unique since you don't see this type of pizza often - it comes with a freshly cracked egg right in the middle of the pizza! We enjoyed its flavours and agreed that this was one of their better tasting items. For dessert, we ordered the apple ravioli - which turned out to be more like an empanada shell encasing caramel apple filling - the pastry shell made the dessert a bit dry but the scoop of vanilla ice cream and side of caramel sauce it came with helped with that. 

The next time I went, we had the avocado BLT and the prosciutto grilled vegetable sandwiches. For a mostly veggies dish, the latter packed a lot of flavour - consisting of grilled eggplant & zucchini, goat cheese, arugula, fried shallots, & olive tapenade (a puree that usually contains olives, capers, anchovies, & olive oil) on house-made focaccia - this is one of my favourite items at Scaddabush. I believe you can choose this sandwich without the prosciutto too for a vegetarian option. The avocado BLT was a pretty good sandwich but tasted simpler than the prosciutto veggie sandwich. 

Scaddabush is a good place for good Italian food. While I can't say that each and every food item is amazing, their mozzarella balls are delicious, their sandwiches are pretty packed with lots of flavour, and their pizzas (big enough to feed 2-3 hungry people) come in unique combinations. Couple the food with a great and cozy atmosphere that has an industrial feel to it plus a section of the kitchen where you can sit and watch mozza orders be made fresh, & you've got a great restaurant experience. 

One more tip - the seating area near the bar (especially the tables with the high seats) can get loud since that's where the store's speakers are located - but if you (kindly) ask them to turn it down, they'll do it for ya!"}
{"text":"CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE! I love their mozzarella cheese because it is made as per order and tastes even better than it looks. Being a chain restaurant you wouldn't expect their food to be amazing but Scaddabush actually has some quality dishes. 

The atmosphere is ideal for a romantic night out with your SO or just a gathering with a few close friends as well. Many of their dishes comes in small, regular, and shareable which can save you some money if two people want the same dishes."}
{"text":"We stopped by here in a whim and were pleasantly surprised. The location is great, and the outdoor patio is big and nicely decorated. The menu is as expected for an Italian joint with items such as Pasta, Pizza and other dishes. We stopped by for a few appetizers and drinks and ordered the meatball and the bruschetta with goat cheese and avocado. The food came out quickly and tasted great. The meatball was especially delicious and something that this restaurant prides itself on as well. For drinks we had the aged Negroni (This restaurant prides on aging their Negroni for 2 weeks and it pays off) and the Peach Bellini which were delicious. The service was great, the waiter was prompt, attentive and checked in on us several times which was a pleasant surprise given how busy the location was that day. For a place that we walked in with little to no expectations we were surprised and would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We ordered balsamic mozzarella. Chicken and shrimp. I'm not a cheese person, buy the fresh mozzarella tastes soooooo good. The balsamic is slightly sweet but taste really good too. Chicken and shrimp with herb spaghetti tastes perfect. The chicken breast tastes fresh and and fresh pasta got the great texture. The service is excellent. The atmosphere is really chill and welcoming! Will definitely go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Super loud environment. Went on a Friday night and waited 30mins for a table for 4. Pizza was good but not the pasta. Pasta portion was pricy for a small portion and is not flavourable . However the cocktails was amazing. I would only recommend drinks and pizza and please do avoid the pasta."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Service could have been better. Our server seemed to focus on my friend more when she took our orders. It also took a while for her to get our bills when we were done eating. She gave us breadsticks when we didn't specifically request for them - she just made an assumption that we wanted more because we ordered the (apparently popular) spinach and artichoke dip. Although we appreciated the gesture, we didn't actually request for them (nor did we want any more at the time). 

Food was somewhat overpriced. Some dishes were better than others. The spinach and artichoke dip were bomb. The baked penne carbonara that I had was very nicely presented. It tasted quite good at first, then became rather heavy as I continued to eat it. As I was finishing up the pasta, I found it to be quite dry and salty. I prefer my pasta to be creamy but it wasn't exactly the case with the baked penne carbonara."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with Italian food. I love coming here for my cheat days. The atmosphere is nice and food isnt bad. I always get their fococcia breads cuz I absolutely love Italian bread and its made fresh. I got the Italian before and it was a bit to heavy for me so this time I got the roasted vegetable fococcia and it was so good. Filled with vegetables and goat cheese. Wasnt a fan of the goat cheese but it was tolerable. And of course their fries are super nice and crispy. You get to choose between rosemary garlic and regular. I got the rosemary garlic last time ans it made me super thirsty throughout the night so I chose regular this time and wasnt as thirsty. We also got the sophia pizza which is grilled chicken with carmalized onion and balsamic vineguar. Also good. But I did notice the portion size was smaller than before, not significantly but noticeable. Service can be a hit or miss. We honestly sat there for 30 minutes before we were able to get someones attention. But other times service was fine."}
{"text":"The food was ok, nothing I'm crazy for. But the staff was very nice, my boyfriend ordered the wrong dish and they brought him was he wanted in the first place. We offered to pay for both and apologized but the staff didn't let us and said not to worry about it."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a tuesday night with no reservations, we got seated in the high top kitchen area in about 10 minutes. Our waiter seemed a bit green but was endearing even though he kept bumping into a lot of things, he was still very friendly. 

We started with the burrata cheese, it was soft and the honey made is slightly sweet, it was delicious but the cheese itself could have been creamy and more solid, when it was cut it was a bit watery and parts of the cheese didnt hold together.

I got the baked carbonara ($17), the pasta and the egg was good and the food came out nice and hot, however it was very salty. The portion was a good size and I was left very full. My friends got the capri and it looked really good and they got a lot of seafood with it. They have a limited selection for their gelato flavours and the apple ravioli was not bad, but nothing memorable.

I would like to return to try their other pastas, it's a great addition to the neighbourhood and a good place to get together with some friends for italian food in the area."}
{"text":"I had high hopes.  Sigh.  I visited with my husband, mom and son.  The waiter was nice and welcoming, but unfortunately, his service fell terribly short.  In the interest of not babbling on for too long, here are the lowlights:

- My mom ordered a pinot grigio and as the waiter was writing it down, I had to interject to ask my mom which one.  There were three PG selections on the wine list.  SHouldn't the server know this?  He couldn't even recommend one over the others, once this was pointed out to him.

- I ordered a malbec.  He actually asked me to point it out on the menu for him (I'm guessing b/c he didn't know how to spell it?  omg, lol)

- we ordered entrees AND appetizers (mozza and calamari).  After waiting forEVER, we finally asked about the ETA and it was met with a blank stare.  He forgot to punch in the apps!  The entrees were on their way, so we decided to cancel the apps.  Nothing I hate more than all that food arriving at once.  The server actually asked me, 'wait - what did you order??'.  This is unacceptable especially since i watched him write it down.  Buddy, look at your notes FFS.  

- We get the food and my husband decides he wants another drink.  wait, wait wait....no drink.  

The service was slow.  The server was green.  The server was understandably embarrassed about the appetizer screw-up, and he apologized profusely.  But we were really annoyed!  The place wasn't busy, the order wasn't complicated.  There is really no excuse.  

My husband went to talk to a manager, if only so he would realize it is unacceptable to have such an inexperienced server manage a table on his own.  The manager (Chris) was super nice about it, which I really appreciate.  In fact, he comped us up the wazoo with a free beer for my husband, free desserts for all four of us, 25% off the bill and coupons for two free desserts and one free mozza app upon our next visit.  This was well above and beyond what I would expect, but I suppose it was warranted.  :)

The food:
my mom and husband enjoyed their steaks.  I had the arabiatta pasta and while the pasta was maybe a bit overcooked for my liking, it was a pretty good dish with the added veg and breadcrumb topping.  We also had the polenta tots which I would recommend.  For dessert I indulged in the cake-jar thing with sponge toffee.  It was delicious.

SO, will I go back?  Yes, but only b/c I have some coupons to use.  If my next visit is anything like this visit, then I probably won't go again.  The food was average, but I appreciate that many of the dishes aren't typical chain-italian-fare.  

As the 2-star review states:  MEH.  I've experienced better."}
{"text":"Excellent chain each one a little different.  Food is consistently excellent atmosphere is relaxing and interesting made up of repurposed building material, old paintings, light fixtures etc.   The name is Italian for a little bit of everything which fits their style nicely."}
{"text":"Love the decor and atmosphere.  The staff are very relaxed and seem to enjoy themselves even though it's super busy at times.   Food is always excellent and bordering on high end cuisine at times which is so nice to have while enjoying a casual setting."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have enjoyed both experiences. Their fresh mozzarella is the BEST. I've tried the naked and the one that is in a hot skillet with a spicy tomato bacon sauce. Both are delicious and definitely worth it! The chicken fettuccini and pizza are good too! Ontario certified teachers also get 15% off through Venngo."}
{"text":"Service was OK. But food was the downer. $18 for chicken pizza with underage tasting dough,lack of mozzarella cheese, $13.50 for overnight tasting meatball that tasted like it wasn't microwaved enough, $12 for greasy tasting avocado bruschetta , and $18 for four shrimps on arugula salad felt overpriced for cheap Italian food."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for a gathering. I've been to the location at Yonge/Gerrard and was not overly impressed with the pasta. I completely avoided the pasta this time and overall enjoyed the experience.

First we ordered several appetizers (bruschetta, calamari, spinach and artichoke dip) which were fairly good. I also ordered the smoked bacon and egg pizza after being told by the waiter that it was one of his favourites. My recommendation...do not order the smoked bacon and egg pizza it is as weird as it sounds. I don't know how to describe it but  I didn't love the taste. The egg was still runny so when I accidentally popped the yolk it was all over the pizza which wasn't great.

Other than that the food was good and drinks were fine as well. Service staff was attentive and friendly. Overall a fun night and looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Food is not amazingly spectacular, but the ambience at this restaurant was relaxing and ultimately helped enhance my experience.

The last time we came it was so packed that we were turned away but was compensated with a coupon that gave us a $20 discount with spending of at least $40.

So we decided to order the Classico bruschetta (small), and calamari for appetizers, and the butcher pizza and Capri pasta.

Classico bruschetta: taste was fairly decent.

Calamari: It was mediocre at best and can say other restaurants with the same pricing make it better.

Capri pasta: it is essentially a seafood pasta. However, the assorted seafood tasted frozen.

Pizza (butcher): this was probably the best dish of the night. Toppings were spread evenly, and the dough was well prepared.

Overall, probably won't be back again unless I have to (unless it's a social gathering)."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to scaddabush. The vibe and decor was nice. Its a very rustic and vintage looking place. We got seated really quickly, however, our food took way too long to come. I got the pesto pollo fettuccine and it was really bland."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today.  They should try a lunch menu with smaller portions.  Maybe we would have tried a few more things.  However, I did try their Margarita pizza and it was delicious.  The crust was perfectly cooked, very light tasting.  The sauce was very subtle but fresh tasting."}
{"text":"So Scaddabush was recommended to my boyfriend and I by a friend and my uncle. Let me tell you the fresh mozzarella was amazing! I have never had it that fresh they make it right on there. The pasta that we orderd was sooo good! It is even made fresh!!! I reccomened this place to many people!"}
{"text":"Scaddabush finally expanded into Markham!  I went to the Mississauga location a year ago and really enjoyed my time there as the food and environment were perfect.  So when they opened in Markham, I came here with a friend on a weeknight craving for some pastas!

Reservation was easy, they have OpenTable so it makes the booking experience very easy and seamless.  Requested a booth using booking and the server took us to a very comfortable booth seats.  For two people, we ordered the Prosciutto Mozzarella to start, Tuscan salad to get some healthy in our system, Large Capri pasta as main and wrap the dinner up with the Baileys Express to share.

I was very impressed with every dish, the Prosciutto Mozzarella was great for 3 people, the cheese was amazing and it complemented well with the sea salt and prosciutto.  Salad was also surprisingly amazing, I am not a big salad guy especially salads with seeds, but the Tuscan salad was amazing!  I love the dressing pairing up with kale and some seeds which brings out some bitterness from a vinegar base dressing.  The Capri is probably the most disappointing dish out of all, although it's still decent in terms of the seafood and sauce it comes with, the pasta itself was a little overcooked, but this could be because the sauce soaked it up a little too much.

Baileys Express is a MUST if you are a big coffee lover, strong coffee with Baileys actually tasted very good, my friend almost wanted to drink the whole thing from me!

Overall, Scaddabush is a great newcomer in Markham area and is a must try place if you want some decent Italian food."}
{"text":"Scaddabush reminds of a better quality east side Mario's but without the unlimted bread and salad. Their calmari is takes kind of like the ones you get from the grocery store. Had the spaghetti and meat balls for the main course and it was solid. Pasta was fine cooked properly and the sauce was decent. The meatball was pretty good. Overall a decent meal, but wouldn't go out my way to visit again."}
{"text":"I really don't know why this place has gotten such mediocre reviews. On recommendation a few friends and I decided to check it out for dinner. The place is quite bustling but our waitress was very nice and super friendly. We decided to split the mozzarella ball as an appetizer and seriously their tomato jam and salt with the mozzarella and bread was amazing. I could have ordered a second just for myself because it was so good. My carbonara was quite good also. Everyone at the table really enjoyed their meals. If I were in the area again I would definitely go back here."}
{"text":"The poster child for bad restaurants.   I stopped in for dinner with a family member.  I ordered one of the Seasonal Specials, the Chicken and Bacon Penne Al Forno.  Expecting the typical \"Italian Serving\" I was surprised to see my $18 gets a modest portion served in a tiny 6\" cast iron frying pan.  For this portion size, $12 is fair.  I had also ordered a side of shrimp, expecting a decent meal in all.  No such luck.

First, the shrimp were dry and tough--a feat you need to work at achieving, since it is pretty hard to make fresh shrimp tough unless you just cook them badly.  But the pasta has a ghost pepper level of heat that was certainly not mentioned on the menu.  It was spicy to the point of being flavourless.  I got through about a third of the serving before I gave up.

My relative ordered the Baked Penne Carbonara, and requested it without scallions.  That would have been fine, since they left out the scallions, but it had onions!  What was the point of deleting the scallions and adding onions (don't recall the onions being listed on the menu)?  Kind of defeats the purpose, huh?  Also, I have never had a \"spicy carbonara\" in my life.  Nearly $19 for that dish, when $11 would be reasonable.  Two thirds of that dish was also packed in a take-out box although I don't know why we took the leftovers.

Our server was excellent.  She could tell there was something not right and made an outstanding effort to find out more, and then approached the management, apparently a waste of her time.  A prime example of a staff member that is way too good to be working there.

We walked out with our $50 mistake and went across the parking lot to 3 Brewers and had a great dinner and awesome desserts for $45."}
{"text":"Excellent friendly service. Very decent food. I only have a beef with the parking since it's so difficult to find parking on a Saturday evening. Otherwise, I'd love to come back...On a weekday evening!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. In fact my husband said it was the best Italian he has had. The focaccia is unbelievable. We liked it so much we went there two nights in a row. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the music is way to loud and wrecks the otherwise perfect experience."}
{"text":"Probably the best casual Italian restaurant and miles ahead when compared to other generic chain restaurant - especially Boston Pizza or even the restaurant it replaces, Alice Fazzolis.

The food is superb - I found charity bread to be one of the best appetizer bread I've ever tasted, the Occo Bucco (Pork riblets) is also terrific. Sphagetti / Meatball is also well cooked and seasoned. The food is solid across the board.

Service is very attentive. You're promptly greeted, seated and server is helpful in providing recommendations and routinely checks.

Overall - great experience and certainly will return."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years. The first time I ever stepped foot into Scaddabush was years ago at their Mississauga location. With the Alice Fazoolis chains being replaced, the new look gives it a more casual, cozier vibe without sacrificing the quality of food this place dishes out. Aside from the quality they've got an extensive food and drink menu to cater a range of clientele
For drinks, I was so happy they served Spanish beer  Estrella Damm..hence I ordered a few pints throughout the evening. However with that being said, our entourage were here for food. 
With some unfortunate miscommunication, my food finally came out. I ended up ordering their polenta bites to compliment my pints lol. Played beautifully, the portions were sufficient, and the quality ingredients they used in their food enriched the dish.
Overall great place that I'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"We came here after the cn tower and we were quite impressed. The decor and atmosphere was amazing. The service was good and the food was impeccable. I enjoyed the pesto pollo pasta so much! It was absolutely perfect. I enjoyed my cold Canadian beer and the incredible atmosphere. I highly recommend this establishment for a night out in downtown. This place is a little pricy but well worth it!"}
{"text":"We come here a about once a month from work.  Always enjoyed the shrimp or lobster pasta, various sandwiches.  Apparently the menu was recently changed - lobster pasta is gone, the serving portions have gotten smaller but the prices seem to remain the same.  The taste has changed somehow as well, it's hard to pin point.  

Why, oh why mess with a good thing???

The next step is probably a price increase.

Will sadly be looking around the area for other lunch options :(("}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this even ONE star is because out of the group of three of us, my dish was the only decent one. I ordered the salmon on kale salad, and it was actually good. But the fact that one of our party's meals came 10 minutes after the other two, and was jumbled up and looked like it had been sitting in a fridge for two days.....was enough to turn me off of this place regardless of my decent kale.

Horrible service. The greeters didn't even look up to acknowledge us entering the restaurant. We stood there for five minutes while they talked to each other, and eventually had to approach THEM to ask them to seat us. 

We ordered salmon on kale, the giant meatball on \"crostini\" (NOT crostini, just a soggy soppy piece of soaked bread that turned to mush), the fettuccine with \"Nonna's Sunday Sauce- Just How Nonna Makes it!\" (No. It is not how my nonna makes it. It was like raw crushed tomatoes.), and some kind of basic club/BLT type sandwich that was pretty bland. The meatball arrived and was huge, like a matzo ball. I tried it and it was salty AF. Like, to a point that I couldn't even swallow it. I'm not even sensitive to salty things! I eat seaweed every single day! This was out of this world salty! To make matters worse, the person in our group who ordered it has a medical condition that would be aggravated by salt so she couldn't even eat more than two bites of it. 

Then came the fettuccine. Ohhhhh, the fettuccine. Where to even begin? It was clumped together, congealed, as if it had been sitting in a fridge for two days and someone said \"oh, I think I'll eat this before it goes bad!\" and just threw it on a plate with some raw crushed tomatoes. The waitress didn't even bring parm to the table to put on top. 

Just all in all......HORRIBLE. The only thing this place has going for it is the creative decor and it could be a good place to go for drinks with a large group. Maybe. 

Bad service, waitress/waiters are nowhere to be found when you need something. The entire experience took something like three hours of our night. 

OH- also, the bread came at the END of our meal. Like right before we were about to pay. And it was \"light on the butter!\" More like SOAKED IN GREASE

Not going back, and hope the management changes things up!"}
{"text":"Love the fresh mozzarella balls! Meatball good too , salad lovely and margarita pizza delicious! Always good staples . Stick to basics here. Tiramisu not good (no real mascarpone in it). Will be back for mozzarella balls and pizza."}
{"text":"My family and I came here from out of town. It was great. Good service. Food was excellent. We had social servings. Like family style. Great flavors. I'll definitely come again when in town. Price was right too."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night and loved it!!   Had the fresh mozzarella with prosciutto and fig jam. Amazing!!  Also had the fried zucchini.  My husband is very picky and said his chicken and shrimp was delicious.  I had the chicken limone and it was fantastic.   We finished it off with the apple ravioli. Mmmmm mmmmmm.  So good!!  A little expensive but we had a lot of food!  The server was absolutely the best.  Attentive, friendly.  Great place.  Decor is cool."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience here. Great service - excellent food. They were very accommodating to our big group. Would go here again!"}
{"text":"Nice service. Food wasn't anything to write home about. But I do want to try that famous hand pulled mozzarella"}
{"text":"Came as a party of eight to have a birthday dinner. No reservations excepted. Asked for a table outside. Were given a long table to sit 15 people . We asked if they could remove part of this structure, as it was not even flat . I could not put a plate on it straight . The chairs were metal all different sizes and we asked for at least  the same chairs. The waiter did lot even set the table . We had to ask for cutlery. I would say the quality of pizza was so mediocre and the pasta was clumped. For desert o brought my pastry and asked for cutlery again . Never got it . The Waiter totally lucked personality, professionalism . 

Will any of us come back? Never again"}
{"text":"The waitress was very nice and friendly. We ordered pizza which came with scissors, which was very cool and different. Too bad the pizza was bland along with their Caesar salad. I could have closed my eyes and taken a bite and I would not have known which salad I was eating, it could have been a Cobb salad. Very disappointing as a TV dinner at home would have been better. Hopefully they can change and add some flavour to their menu."}
{"text":"Had the stuffed meatball sandwich and baked carbonara.  The food wasn't as expected.  The old Alice fazooli did a better job.  The portions were not good for the price we paid.  13 dollars for a meatball sandwich with no sides wasn't really worth it.  They advertise their meatballs as a signature dish but it wasn't very flavourful.  Carbonara was a dry at the top,i would have rather went to Grazie for the same price.  Service was good but not anything extraordinary."}
{"text":"Went with a friend to this location based on his recommendation of Scaddabush. Terribly disappointed in the service. Started off with our waitress introducing herself and taking our order in a timely manner (which was fine). Once our food arrived she was no where to be found. I ordered the shrimp spaghetti and upon my fork twisting the pasta for the first time, I see a long strand of hair intertwined in it. I looked around and our waitress is no where to be found. My friend offers to share his food with me while we wait. Finally another server comes around and I explain the situation and I decide to have another one made. I notice he is also the bartender for the night but was now taking care of our table. New pasta comes out but I already lost my appetite. I take a few bites and decide to get the rest to go. Long wait until bartender server comes back to our table as he was busy making drinks. Bill arrives finally. No discount whatsoever. Yeah I won't come back here."}
{"text":"They get no stars for no service.
Refused entry upon arrival.
9pm on a Saturday night, table for two, and they said and I quote, \"I'm sorry but we are not seating anybody anymore this evening.\"
After which, another couple walked in, and appeared to be seated as we left, dumbfounded as too why we were refused service. 
Will never return to this restaurant again. Was a regular customer (once a week) but no more."}
{"text":"Scaddabush is one of my regular Italian haunts (other one is Nonnas oven on Elgin Mills). 

Really enjoy their mozzarella, and pasta. Both are made fresh in house and pasta is al dente. Not quite as al dente as in Italy but I'm convinced that's because the flour is different there. 

Today we had the lobster spaghetti and the bomba burrata mozzarella. Portions were great for two people (we tend to eat less), spaghetti sauce was fresh, pasta was cooked perfectly so the food was awesome. Server was also great, and helped us split the portions knowing we were sharing. 

Things they can improve? Well the service was a little on the slow side, although we weren't in a rush so not a big deal."}
{"text":"great place and great people. enjoyed quality of food just a bit waiting time ."}
{"text":"pretty good, their home-made cheese was tasty. Homemade pasta was cooked well and quite good too! Their meatball was a little on the salty side and tasted like it had a lot of filler, but we still pleasantly enjoyed our meal there.

We had the nicest server during our time at Scaddabush. She took the time to explain things on the menus, how it's made and what she recommends. She was nice enough to plate our large salad on two separate plates since she knew we would be sharing everything!.  I would say the food is a 3, and an extra star for our server!"}
{"text":"Our party of four stopped in for dinner before the Raptors game because it looked inviting and we all enjoy Italian food. Two of us ordered the Americano pizza, one the Margherita pizza, and one the Chicken Parmesan. Please do not order the Americano unless you LOVE pepperoni more than your own mother. It was completely covered from end to end with pepperoni. The pepperoni caused it to be terribly greasy and was quite a mess. The Margherita was great, light, and not messy/greasy at all. The chicken parmesan was pretty standard. The three cheese 'charity bread' was quite oily on the bottom. Overall, mediocre. Would probably try something else to see what it was like. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak medium rare.. it was so hard and chewy my mouth was sore by the end of the meal. The waitress recommended it too :o my friends all enjoyed their pastas, salads and pizzas though. Their portions are good for the price :) would return but would not get the steak lol."}
{"text":"It was really busy on a Saturday Night! There was hardly any parking, had to park way far and walk to Scaddabush. Went in and there was also a long waiting line as well. Said about 1/2 hr wait. Got a buzzer light and waited outside away from the crowd. 

The decor in the restaurant was unique, it matched the restaurant name \"Scaddabush\" a little bit of everything.

The stewardess was very sweet and nice when she seated us. Our waitress was also very courteous.

We ordered a bunch of stuff for a party of 4.
I ordered a Lemon Rosemary Soda.
It was ok, but nothing special.
Apps: Fresh Mozzarella & Giant Meatball.
The fresh mozz was delicious and the meatball wasn't bad either.

For my main I ordered the Small Lobster Spaghetti.
I love the texture of their spaghetti, there was a bit of a chew, which i liked and the sauce was a nice pairing.  
One of our friend's main didn't come yet and the manager was kind enough to apologize and even gave our friend a free salad.

Wanted to also try some desserts.
We ordered the Zeppole & Apple Ravioli.
It was a bit of a disappointment. The Zeppole was a bit dry and the Apple Ravioli was just a half flat empanada apple pie with Vanilla Ice Cream on a mini cast iron skillet. That was also nothing special. 

Overall, the good was great and the ambiance of the place was excellent. It was just a tad too loud, cuz they had a live DJ there."}
{"text":"I heard about Scaddabush from a friend of mine who was craving Italian food and raved about this restaurant for its consistency and quality of their dishes. I was never really a huge fan of Italian food because of how overwhelming and filling the dishes are - however this restaurant gave me a different perspective that made me appreciate how delicious Italian food can be!

First time entering this restaurant in October 2016, I remember thinking how cool it looked! The interior décor is quite large and unique with their chandeliers, distinctive pieces of furniture and their use of candles throughout the restaurant. My friend and I came in at around 5:00PM on a Wednesday and we were immediately seated to a booth. 

The menu was very easy to read and with a wide range of options. The menu items are a bit on the pricier side, and some items were in Italian, so we decided to ask the waiter a few questions about each meal. Our waiter was very informative and even gave us a little spiel on how their famous Mozzarella is hand-made in their kitchen. This easily convinced us to get their Bruchetta Mozza with sun-dried tomato. My friend decided to get the small size spaghetti and meatball while I got the Italian burger.

I'll be quite honest - I was kinda skeptical on my friend getting the spaghetti because of their emphasis on the fact that it was only ONE meatball, rather than meatballS. I laughed and I told her that it was probably going to be a rip off. She laughed back and told me to wait.

.
.
.

Damn, was I wrong. that meatball was pretty big - as big as my fist! 

The spaghetti and meatball tasted beyond amazing. I never really thought of spaghetti as anything special, I always found the dish to be quite bland until I tried the spaghetti at this restaurant. There's something about it that makes it different than spaghetti you make at home - there's flavour from the cheese that makes each bite of it very mesmerizing and soft to chew. The meatball was packed with many spices that combined with the cheese made it very savoury. My friend could not finish the entire meal and had to bring it home with her.

My meal, the Italian burger, was delightful. It came with a side of fries that were crispy and tasty to eat. The burger was a bit oily, but it was jam packed with a lot of meat, pesto and mozzarella. Oh sweet hallelujah the mozzarella at this restaurant is quite delectable - just thinking about it makes my mouth water!

The Bruchetta Mozzarella was probably the best part of the meal. While the portion is a bit on the smaller size, taking a bite each time always reminded me of why it was worth the money. This isn't typical cheese you buy at the grocery store and I can guarantee you that you will fully enjoy your meal at Scaddabush!

This restaurant is unique in its own way. The staff was very helpful and it gave me the impression that this restaurant is perfect to bring a group of friends for a night out and to simply relax and have fun. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to someone who is apathetic about Italian food and wants to give it another try. I am definitely coming back here again in the future."}
{"text":"They do have good food for a chain and the service is good. I also like the patio outside. You can easily have a business meeting at this place but you either have to arrive early, like 11:50 or make a reservation"}
{"text":"It was the Iran Spain match, we went in with my team to watch the game, asked to switch the channel to TSN - the staff were nice and changed it for us and a few other guests. I got excited and cheered when Iran scored and the super rude bartender took my glass of wine away and said enough for you!!!! It didn't have anything to do with alcohol, I just was excited that Iran scored (although offside) - went in and talked to the manager, told her that I was offended by the bar tender's behaviour, she pretty much said yeah the bar tender was joking!!! 
I'm surprised how they mix up rudeness and joking together and their managers don't recognize the inappropriate behaviour of their staff! Anyways, I'm never going back to this bar as I can't stand rudeness and ignorance!!!"}
{"text":"Huge Italian food fan here so of course I'm going to give this place a try. I've come just for the desserts before and loved the Zeppole (deep fried dough with sugar and hazelnut sauce on the side). It's a really simple dessert and easy one biters. 

We actually had our company party here and they were amazing helping us get the party room booked and set up. We had a nice time, a great space to ourselves, and there were 4 servers for our party. To start off, we had the Scaddabush garlic bread and garden/ caesar salad.The bread was drenched in oil, so not the type of garlic bread I would go for, but that garden salad was perfect. Lightly dressed with a vinaigrette and lots of bright, unwilted colours. 

The mains were a bit disappointing. The crusted snapper was good, but the fish was very heavily crusted so it wasn't so much a fillet of fish.. more like crumbs of fish. Flavour wise, it was nice and light, and most people seemed to enjoy it as well. The Chicken Parmesan was a huge let down. The spaghetti was a mushy pile of mush..wayyy over cooked and not much flavour. The chicken did not seem to have been seasoned at all and the cheese on top was very bland. The tomato sauce was also very bland. over all, it was a bland dish that most of us who ordered it were fairly disappointed with. 

The dessert came by and we had sorbetto. Wildberry was very VERY sweet. Most of us did not finish it. The lemon flavour was super sour, and again, very concentrated tasting. Neither tasted like it was made with any fresh ingredients which was very disappointing. 

We had ordered teas and coffees.. only about 10/50 people got theirs.. The rest of us had the little milk container and the sugars, but never received our tea's/coffee's. 

Over all, the staff are nice and the food at regular tables looked great, so I would probably return as a regular customer to try again. I would not recommend booking a party here. It seems that the party menu is not cooked with the same attention to detail as if you were a regular table here. And you don't get to finish the meal off with your coffee/tea."}
{"text":"Came in after a long walk, on a hot day and a little tired the food was great but the service was even better really made the day enjoyable.  Props to Laila you do an awesome job"}
{"text":"It was tasty, although the service was a little slow. Nothing memorable but the restaurant is able to accommodate for large groups."}
{"text":"After eating at the Younge St location a few years back we decided on giving this one a shot after leaving the Toronto Comic-Con yesterday. I knew what to expect when coming here as the food was delicious the first time around. The menu has a pretty good selection from pizza, to pasta, to everything in between. I ended up ordering the Stuffed meatball sandwich (which is the same thing I got the first time, but hey, it's awesome). The sandwich is hard to actually eat like a sandwich thanks to it's large size but it's worth attempting to eat like one for at least the first few bites. The meal was great, the service was great, and even though the prices were maybe a few dollars higher then some of the competitors  in the area, I don't mind it when the overall experience is great, would definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Great service with mediocre Italian food. 

Shared the polenta balls and calamari to start. Was good, not amazing.  

Had a one of their pizzas for an entrée, was a big portion and tasty!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is extremely overpriced, and the food is not worth the price. The food is alright and the portions are very small. The restaurant is very big, and it is usually busy so the service isn't very good."}
{"text":"I booked a reservation for 30 people for my birthday, quick service, awesome food, comfy, and spacious. Love this place !! The manager was very nice too"}
{"text":"I really wanted to concentrate on the food for this review but our waitress was just a rude person that was angry at life. Our tip to you shouldn't have been twenty percent it should have been \"you are in the service industry suck it up buttercup or find another job you miserable lady\"

We arrived late about 12:15am. If they said they stopped serving food we would have been fine and moved on but the kitchen was open. The waitress made a point of 1 being miserable 2 looking at her watch every time she stopped at our table. We ordered right away and ate right away her other tables that were already there stayed after we left. You are the opposite of Canada lady. My buddy ordered a beer and I only got water. Beer came right away water about 15 minutes later. Perhaps she had to go the lake and get some by hand the way she acted about it. 

The pizza was average but the bacon (see pic) was cheap bacon and raw. If you do not precook bacon do not put it on a pizza as it does not cook on the bottom. Use back bacon instead or precook it. Any way Canada sucks for pizza and it was my fault for thinking they would be different. Only reason for two stars is the hostess. She was pleasant, friendly and took pride in her job. She needs to be a waitress and our waitress needs to be a dishwasher...such a miserable person."}
{"text":"Not a lot of vegetarian or vegan options here! I just ate a spinach salad with beets and walnuts. It was good, but not amazing in my opinion. My friend ordered mozzarella sticks, which was good apparently, and my other friends liked their food too"}
{"text":"Patio opening day!  Too bad it was windy, otherwise the music and food and people would make this event more enjoyable.  Party moved indoors everyone is still having some fun.  Hors d'oeuvre were served around the tables, free drinks to sample.  No loss at all.  Come ify you don't know where to eat tonight."}
{"text":"Came in during a snow storm at around 7:00, and we were immediately seated in a cozy little booth. Our server was Stefani, and I'm pretty sure God had blessed our choice of restaurant beforehand because she was most definitely an angel! Service was impeccable, she was more than helpful when asked about the new features, she made sure the wine we wanted was in stock before we made our order, and she always made sure our glasses were full. The ambiance was lovely, with soft music and dim lights, it's the perfect place for an intimate meal and conversation. Food came in almost right away. We ordered their famous charity bread, delicious as usual. For the main I got the pesto Alfredo fettuccini with extra sauce, and the boyfriend got a crispy Parmesan chicken sandwich. Both tasted very good, and the sandwich was so crispy and delicious that I had more than a few bites! We wanted to go for deserts but we simply did not have enough room for anything. 

I like to consider myself a Scaddabush regular, since it's my go to restaurant for when I'm craving yummy food in food hearty portions. Tonight's experience was one of the more remarkable ones. Stefani, you stole our hearts. Thank you for being a wonderful server and making our special night even more so. 

TLDR; delicious food, great portions, excellent service!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a friends birthday roughly a party of 15 or so people, and since we were fairly a large group we were given set menus ok cool no problem... This makes the kitchens life easy and the waitstaff can run smoothly with the party. hmmmmmmmm nope not here 

Here's were I start to get bitchy...

IF you give your patrons set menus, please have waitstaff that are experienced enough with running a party, not some snotty rude waitress who couldn't figure out which side to go, what to ask, what anyone ordered. Everyone had something issue, wrong meals... no meals... no utensils, wrong bills ! all of this took an extra hour of everyone's time to clear up. She came around with deserts asked what me what I had ordered for desert. Told her no one ever asked me for desert and instead of politely apologizing she walked away and continued serving others. 

For the main course, I ordered the Pesto Pollo... pitched a fork in it and lifted the entire entree!! I had to use a knife and cut into it look like a pasta cake. The entire dish lacked flavour and was just unappetizing. I tried my boyfriends pizza and that however, was actually really good. 

I'll give this place another shot in the late future. But for now.... ciao bella !"}
{"text":"Food was delicious!  This is my 3rd time coming.  The 1st and 3rd time I came the food was awesome! 2nd time I came the spaghetti for the lobster spaghetti was way too overdone and the naked mozza app we ordered came out at most room temperature but they compensated for that by taking the mozza app off the bill.  I'm not sure if they r understaffed because every time I came it seemed quite difficult to flag down your waiter.  Maybe next time I will have to ask for 2 bottles of water for the table, since u can never flag down your waiter thus always left thirsty.
 Every time I came, I ordered the pizzas and it is always AWESOME.  The mozza is also to die for, especially when it is hot.  
Overall the food is very good and I would recommend this place for cheese and pizza lovers, however service was a little lacking.  Price value is good.  Pasta is good.  Pizza and mozza OMG I LOVE it!  Meatballs are excellent too.  Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"The service was okay, she never really came to us. But I went there twice, the first time with my family the second with my boyfriend. The first time it was really good, the regular chicken Parmesan. My mom enjoyed her pasta with seafood, my dad loved the steak with some garlic Parmesan fries, and my brother said his carbonara was bomb. The desserts were good but they ran out of panna cotta that day.. 

The second time I got the pasta with there special stuffed meatball. Which I don't recommend it was really salty. I ordered a side of garlic Parmesan fries because I remembered the last time I went. But they turned out under dressed which made them taste like regular fries. We told the girl we wanted to put them in containers but as she was getting the plates she put the garbage on the food, and threw them out.."}
{"text":"I've been twice for lunch during the week, got the same pasta and both times it was clumpy and stuck together.. Dinner wasn't like that. They must pre cook their pasta. Disappointing for $20 pasta. Wonder how they don't know this? Or maybe they just don't care!!"}
{"text":"Loved the pasta. Kids gulped down their kids menu pasta. My son said \"it's the best pasta ever.\" And he's picky. I had the meatball pasta, size of a tennis ball and it was moist and full of flavour. Fresh made spaghetti was al dente. We had and polanta appetizer, it didn't impress."}
{"text":"The food is decent but the service isn't good. Went on a Sunday night when it wasn't busy. Ordered pasta, was never offered water, Parmesan, or pepper. Server never came around to ask how the food was either. Took a long time to get the bill as well. Wouldn't recommend the Richmond Hill location."}
{"text":"Food is great here. However, service is a little slow as me and my friends had to wait over 15 minutes to find a server to take our order as there was no one around."}
{"text":"Friendly staff but very slow service and average food is all I can say about this place.

There was always times that we needed to remind our server what we needed at our table; he mentioned that some of the staff had taken off that day and he was short handed but for me as a customer, this should not be an excuse.

We tried their cheese board and It was delicious.

That night apparently they were out of their fresh made pasta and we had no option other than choosing between the gluten free or whole wheat pre-made pasta.
Overall, food was OK, nothing special and the taste was good.

The place is cozy and inviting also; good for larger group of people or those who like louder restaurants."}
{"text":"You can find Scaddabush in the same plaza area as Jack Astor's and close to Destiny. The interior is trendy with bare brick walls and cool lighting features, nice place for a date!

Got a starter which was the Fresh Mozzarella, Naked. It's served with some sea salt, tomato jam and crostini. This was delicious and my favourite part of the meal. I'm not sure how you're supposed to eat it, but I enjoyed cutting off a small piece of cheese, lightly dip in the salt, add some tomato, and eat it on top of a bite of crostini.

I also had the smoked bacon and egg pizza. This comes flat bread style with a pair of scissors. The pizza was fairly topped and the chili oil added a nice kick. I enjoyed the egg on top which was recommended to be broken and spread over.

Overall fun place. Good food. Friendly service, but a little pricey. ($20-30)"}
{"text":"After a less than impressive experience at their Scarborough location, I was a bit reluctant to dine here but my dining companions were looking forward to it so I gave in. Good thing I did.

Nice atmosphere, good service, the floor in our section was a bit slippery, were the first impressions. Our food arrived a little quicker than we anticipated (before our last diner arrived). It certainly looked good.

I ordered the grilled sirloin steak which was tender, juicy, and cooked perfectly medium rare. It could have used a few grains of salt but it was good. My companions enjoyed their meals as well - freshly made pasta and pizza.

I guess there is something to be said about second chances. Oh, and my friend picked up the tab. Yesss! I should have ordered dessert..."}
{"text":"Scaddabush Richmond Hill seemed like a good place to meet up with some old high school friends because it was conveniently located close to major highways for guests coming from all parts of the city. The menu had a lot of choices, the prices seemed quite reasonable, and it's a nice neighbourhood. All good things.

A few of us arrived early and starving so we ordered drinks and appetizers. We started with Charity Bread, a cheesy, buttery garlic bread, Calamari Friiti, Osso Bucco Bites, and Zucchini Fritti.

The Charity Bread was good enough for us to order more. We did. The calamari was lightly dusted and fried crispy. Very nice. The Zucchini had a light crispy batter, similar to tempura. The Osso Bucco Bites were also lightly dusted and fried crispy. It's nothing like any osso bucco I've ever had but it tasted good anyway.

For our mains, almost all of us chose pasta so we ordered the social size for sharing,like family style dining. We the Shrimp Spaghetti, Fettuccine Capri (seafood), the Pesto Pollo Fettuccine (chicken), and Zucca Ravioli. One person had to be different and ordered The Butcher pizza. We shared that too. Everything was perfectly cooked and tasted great. My favourites were the chicken pasta and the pizza. We had no room left for dessert.

The service was good. The ambiance was nice, with lighting on the dimmer side, and it wasn't too loud.I would come back."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner for a group of 10 and thought it was a pretty average experience. My girlfriend and I got the spaghetti and stuffed meatball social off the recommendation from the server that it would be enough for 2-4 people but we thought this was barely the case...

Pasta was very average and the stuffed meatball wasn't as flavourful as expected. Service was also slow and not enough water was served for the group."}
{"text":"Came here for a company team lunch. Food was great!  Loved the scissors provided for the pizzas! Will be back to try the house made mozzarella. Also joining their website subscription gives you a nice discount as well"}
{"text":"This new branch of Scaddabush has been in the works for a while, and the wait is finally over! The location is can't be beat. The downtown core, ACC, CN tower and union station are just steps away, so it's the perfect spot to gather before or after events. The space itself is deceptively big, which will hopefully make it easier to grab a table during peak hours.

I always drift towards pasta, especially when it is made fresh in house. They have a sign informing you of who is making the pasta that day (thanks Neil!). I got the fettuccine capri, which as a softer wide pasta peppered with little peices of shrimp, clams, and calamari. The flavor was unfortunately bland and less flavorful than I was hoping for. The additional sprinkling of freshly shaved parmesean and pepper did little to help the situation. I stole off my neighboring plate and found the shrimp spaghetti much more to my tastes. The spagetti was a good al dente, the flavor was bold and there was even a spoonful of fried capers to sprinkle over the dish. I will definitely order that next time instead.

One thing that can't go wrong is the portion size. I got the small, and their small is more like a generous 'regular' size in any other restaurant. I came starving and I could barely finish my dish. Be prepared for leftovers if you go for the bigger portions, or alternatively share it with someone!"}
{"text":"Rarely do I crave for pasta,  so a new Italian place would not entice me.  The first time I've been to Scaddabush,  it wasn't the food,  but the endless bottles of wine that caught my eye.  This place demonstrates an energy vibe I cannot explain,  blame it on the 80's music in the background.  I ordered a glass of Terre Nuove to go with the buratta,  which was infused with honey and truffle cream and crostini on the side.  If you are not a big fan of Truffles,  order something else.  There's no skimping on Truffles as it was more than subtle.  The light sweetness of honey,  the earthy taste of truffles perfectly complemented the chewy mild buratta. The Italian burger was good,  juicy and savoury. 
A day after,  I came back to revisit.  Actually,  it's the buratta that was calling my name, I had no choice but to obey. And obey I did,  this time with a glass of Malbec ,  okay two glasses. The pesto pollo was good,  but not mind blowing. The americano was a bit watered down,  but it was not so bad. The service and ambiance made up for it.  I will definitely be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I love their Fresh Mozzarella, tried Naked and Burrata, and both of them are soooooo darn good.  I was lucky that I can order their Fresh Mozzarella during lunch hours, as it is usually available during the dinner hours only :-D

Their pasta are also fresh made in house, and they are all delicious!!  I really like Pesto Pollo Fettuccine~*  Fettuccine Capri is a bit spicy for me (my tolerance level is quite low tho), but it still very good.

Waiter & Waitress are friendly and nice... It's a bit slow, and need time to find our own waiter / waitress.  One of my friend has food allergy, but our waiter remember all her requests and can help her to customize her dish.  In another time, I can see our waitress tried her best to make sure we are good for everything, even she is very busy.

I will give 5 stars IF they have better dessert..."}
{"text":"The mozzarella is great, but that's about it. Our pasta was waaay over cooked, and the furthest thing from al dente. Big fail if you're an Italian resto."}
{"text":"Went with a friend who absolutely loves this place, I thought it was average.  Tons of seating, screens, and people bustling all the time.  Their signature app was okay, but to be fair, I'm not a huge cheese fan, so if it was superb, it was lost on me.  My friend thought it was divine.  I had the chicken pizza and it was enjoyable.  It didn't wow me, but I had no complaints.  Would not be opposed to returning, but would not be high on my list."}
{"text":"So I went to Scaddabush (which took over Alice Fazooli's early last month) to see what their food is like. We went there for Sunday dinner - it was busy, and we did reservations, but the place they put us in was right next to a cabinet where sometimes staff would go in to get stuff. So i have to dock points off for seating. The tables are nice and big, which is good, but the chairs are quite low to the ground. We had two kids that came and had to give them the chairs that were not sinking in so that they can sit high enough to eat. We weren't offered booster seats or anything either. But the kids managed to eat fine with the big chairs.

Food was surprisingly pretty good! We ordered a bunch of things:

Buratta Mozzarella
Cheese tasted really good, you can really taste the truffle in it and it was hint of sweetness to it. Comes with focaccia crostini and it went really well together with the mozzarella. Four of us shared this and felt it was good enough for a tasting per person. This dish came out later than it was supposed to (by later I mean after our mains got here) so it was on the house. Brownie points for that! 

Calamari
The calamari was a bit chewy inside, but I really liked the breading and overall thought it was pretty good. I can't say it's the best calamari I've ever had, but I would say it was pretty tasty.

Spaghetti and Meatball (giant) 
Although this is a simple dish, I really enjoyed the taste. the Sunday sauce was very delicious! the meatball was definitely known for its size. it's like a tennis ball! we broke it into pieces and ate it with the spaghetti, and it was very very tasty dish, would definitely come back to eat that again.

The Butcher Pizza
Pizza was really good! wasn't your typical round pizza - more rectangular shape, but the toppings on it were very good. I enjoyed it  - however because of the ingredients, I did find the pizza to be a bit on the salty side (for my liking). It would be nice to see if they can have a pizza where it's not just charcuterie meats as the protein source as another option as I feel that was the reason why it was a bit too salty.

Pesto Pollo
I don't usually like pesto pasta in particular, but this dish made the exception. the pesto was really good! and the fresh pasta really worked well with the dish. I also found the dish pretty balanced in terms of taste, and nothing was overpowering other flavours. Definitely would eat this one again :)

Capri
I was disappointed in this pasta. the sauce I found was a bit too sweet even though it should just be a basic tomato sauce. Also there was supposed to be shrimp and mussels and scallops. I saw a lot of mussel shells, but I didn't see ANY shrimp on this pasta - I even dug around the pasta (we had to take it home coz we coudln't finish) and still no shrimp. So it felt like i was just eating pasta, because mussels the shells take up all the room and the scallops were really small (baby size) and there was only a few. I normally love seafood pasta at Italian restaurants, and I'm not so sure if i want to try eating the seafood mains/pasta again. 

Service was really good I have to say, waitress kept checking up on us to make sure everything was okay and the manager even came and introduced himself. We used the 25% off coupon for the dinner. They helped us store a birthday cake, which was very nice of them. 

Hopefully this place will fix some of the old problems Alice Fazooli's had, but i have to say, I\"m a huge fan of seafood, I\"m afraid to try the lobster pasta only because the Capri really didn't turn out the way I was anticipating it to be. But I will say there are some dishes at this restaurant I would like to come back for a second time to eat!"}
{"text":"I am a pasta lover person, and I must say that the shrimp pasta they had was excellent! I enjoyed it very much, I ordered the small portion which was around 16$ ish approximately, they were really small portion in my opinion, if is a little bit bigger portion than the small one but not as big portion as the large one then it would of been perfect! I definitely recommend this place to have lunch or dinner, the fried calamari was really good too!"}
{"text":"Review based solely on takeout. 

Ordered the Tuscan salad to go which costed $16 after tax on the way home from work. Not sure why it was so expensive for such awful quality. 

The kale was bitter and wilted. The stems were long and quite tough to the point where it kept scrapping my throat trying to chew it down. Also wanted to point out there were no pumpkin seeds, very little cheese, and virtually provided very low quantity of dressing making this whole salad perfect grazing pasture for cows--now, stuff all that into a sad looking cardboard box that wouldn't clapse together!

All that to say, if I wanted this quality, I'd be happy to walk a bit further to Timmy's for the exact same quality only much much cheaper. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday night, was fairly busy inside but we were sat almost immediately. First,  such amazing service here! Our server was very accommodating and friendly to us, no complaints there! Next, the food; we ordered the burrata as an app. It was spicy and obviously very fresh! We then shared the caprese salad and diavolo pizza to share. Both were great and tasty! Price is pretty average but this is definitely not a place to save a few bucks. Overall, nice Italian restaurant with a rustic feel and great food."}
{"text":"Good food but service is super slow. Quantity of food served is also good. Love their sandwiches and pizzas. Desserts are not worth the price. They need to really improve on their service. We were at a point of frustration that we almost went to the front to pay the bill."}
{"text":"Don't let the fact this is a chain to discourage you from going.    Their pasta, which is fresh and made onsite, is perfect! I had the roasted fennel and sausage which was excellent!   My hubby had the Americana pizza, who said it was very good.  Good spice and crust.   Not to mention the great friendly waitress, Holly.   We will come back."}
{"text":"Cocktails are amazing and $10! 
Awesome Caesar  
Food is okay
Do not recommend the squash ravioli, very sweet
Beautiful large patio 
Both the bar and dining area have lots of comfortable seating"}
{"text":"This is one of my friends favorites and she often comes here with family and friends. I love Italian, so I thought why the heck not-- introduce me! 

I had the spaghetti and meatballs and it was very good. We also shared a bottle of the Moscato which was delish. 

The ambience was beautiful and comfortable; the service was outstanding.

At the end of the day it wouldn't be my first choice to come back, because ultimately the experience was a little forgettable, and the bill was a little pricey for what we got."}
{"text":"We came here for date night on Friday around 6:30, just beating the crowd. We were seated promptly. The waiter was friendly and helpful in giving suggestions as it was our first time and we weren't entirely sure what to order. 

We decided on the Naked Fresh Mozzarella ($11.98), Smoked Bacon & Egg Pizza ($15.96) and the Pesto Pollo Pasta ($18.97), to share. The waiter offered to plate the pasta on 2 plates for us which was nice. 

The mozzarella was delicious and went well with the tomato jam. The smoked bacon and egg pizza was good. It had a thin crust and came with a poached egg on top which we had to break apart and spread over the pizza. I've never had egg on a pizza before. The taste of the egg was a nice touch but overall, it wasn't that special. The pasta was fresh with good pesto flavour although I don't think there was much chicken in the dish. 

Tip: if you know you're coming here, sign up to be part of their social club and get a coupon for $10 off $30 (before gratuities and taxes). It takes 24hrs for it to be emailed to you, so do it at least a day in advance."}
{"text":"I came here with a bunch of my friends and it was our first time, except for one who really loves scaddabush and was the one who recommended the restaurant. When coming in, I had pretty high hopes since I was hearing such good reviews about it but when I actually got the food it was sort of just ok. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the Sophia Pizza that I got, it was really delicious and I do not regret getting it, but would I recommend this place or suggest that we go here again? Probably not. The service was great, our waitress was very nice. The water tasted kind of stale, like it had been sitting in that bottle for quite some time but other than that the whole experience was alright."}
{"text":"The shrimp spaghetti was delicious, small size was plenty for me.  Service was efficient and friendly"}
{"text":"Got FOOD POISONED after meal!!!

Overpriced!  Pizza is more like flatbread.  Pasta was average.  Everything came out cold!  Service was slow!"}
{"text":"My sister have invited me here for my birthday dinner.  The atmosphere is great.  The server was very responsive.  During the dinner, one piece of garlic bread dropped on the floor due to mistake by the person who delivered the food.  She didn't insist of giving us back a fresh piece of garlic bread and pretend nothing had happen.  We then later told to our server about the situation and he then quickly get us extra bread (no charge).  Overall the food is good.  We ordered chicken pesto pasta, shrimp pasta, etc.  Reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the garlic bread incident.  It's something the delivery person should not ignore and pretend nothing had happen."}
{"text":"3.5
Scaddabush is what you'd expect a fast paced Italian restaurant to be. A bit chaotic and noisy, yet happy and friendly at the same time. A good place for a celebration or party when you want something other than an East Side Mario's or a Spaghetti Factory. People seem to give it mixed reviews and this place may not be for everyone, but it's definitely worth a try.

The menu does have something for everyone. I've had the pasta and the crusted snapper, both tasty and generous in portion size, although I found their seasoning to be mild (ask for chili oil to spice up your pasta) . Their mozzarella is a unique appetizer and is made fresh in house. They invite you to speak with the person who makes the cheese if you want to learn more about the process, which I thought was pretty cool.

Kind of tricky to navigate this location as there are a dozen other restaurants around. The wait staff are pros and know the business. They do get hurried, yet you never feel rushed."}
{"text":"The atmosphere, service and food were all exceptional! 3 cheese garlic loaf, mozzarella then fresh pasta, all fantastic! I won't need to eat for another 3 days... Holly took great care of us, she was the perfect balance of making sure we were happy & letting us enjoy our meal. We sat right at the bar where the pasta & mozzarella was made, fun & fascinating. What a great experience, can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Alright. First day was a bad hiccup. Ordered the sirloin 7oz med rare and was served it Blue and cold. No issues. Sent it back, got it charred but still bluish. 

Great pizzas though, fantastic ambiance, busy. Good service. The chicken and shrimp in a Thai curry base was quite good as well.

Artichoke and spinach dip a def go to along with the Caprese salad. 

Micheal was excellent taking care of our order. Make a reservation."}
{"text":"Great pizza! I recommend the meatballs as an appetizer as well. If you come on Wednesdays there is 5 dollar wine! 

The place is very trendy and has a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"First impression - waiter was super nice. He was all smiles and sounded very energized and enthusiastic. 

Came her on a Friday for lunch and the place was fairly busy but still room for more customers. 

Stuffed meatball $13.58 - about the size of a tennis ball and stuffed with a small amount of mozzarella. It was packed with flavours and tasted great. Just wish I didn't have to share it :)

Small Zucca $15.92 - it was indeed very small. Good portion for females but for a grown man with a big appetite like myself, it would have been like a drop in a pond. The flavours though were outta bounds like Guy Fieri would say. The ravioli was stuffed with butternut squash which had a hint of sweetness. All the other ingredients that accompanied the dish came all together really well and made this a very memorable dish.

Smoked bacon and egg pizza $15.96. Its a really messy dish to eat because of the egg yolk. You also need to slice the pizza yourself with the special scissors they give you and that just made things even more messy. Overall, wasn't that impressed with this pizza. I did enjoy how the crispiness of the crust.

Overall, a great place for Italian food. I definitely want to come back to try more of their pasta's."}
{"text":"Great place for Italian, Good for dinner with group of friends and even gatherings for larger groups.
Their signature fresh Mozzarella  is a must try."}
{"text":"Went to Toronto for my boyfriends birthday and came here to eat , food was really really good and the atmosphere was good as well. Service was excellent and they really catered to us being from out of town. Drinks were a little eh. But it was overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Excellent service here, I wish I could recall the name of our server but she was super helpful. She informed us she has tried all the dishes and if we needed a recommendation to let her know. 

Party of 6 on a Sunday evening, made reservations over the phone as the online system wasn't working yet. Sign up for the Social Club prior to dining here and get discounts - I got $25 off when you spend $50 or more. 

The concept of the menu is quite unique, they have option of different sizes for the pasta which is good for large parties. Food arrived promptly and everything arrived hot and fresh. 

Ordered the following dishes: 
* Stuffed Meatball Sandwich 
* Lobster Spaghetti 
* Grilled Sirloin Fold Over
* Pesto Pollo 

Must try the Rosemary garlic fries! It had the perfect amount of garlic. Oh and sides are not included, it's an extra $2.97 per side and for premium sides $3.97 (Check menu to confirm). 

Overall, I would love to come back here and try their other dishes! Service is top notch and friendly. This is definitely an improvement from Alice Fazooli's."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night dinner to avoid waiting long for a parking spot. As we all know that plaza is difficult to find parking at peak times. Restaurant was clean, we were seated within seconds of arriving. Server was very knowledgable. The Calamari, Zucca Ravioli, and Stuffed Spaghetti & Meatballs tasted great! They also offer daily drink specials. Overall, it was a good experience!"}
{"text":"Okay, it wasn't perfect but I really liked it! It's more of a 4.5 stars for me.

Staff: Service is quite good. I tried to book a reservation online but there didn't seem to be any availability between 5 to 8. I took a shot and called and they were very accommodating and I got a reservation (huzzah!). Our server did a great job, but a bit slow at time points (I think people were asking for the bills and food orders at the same time so I'll just write it off as a fluke scenario). Food came pretty quick though. Overall very nice and friendly service.

Ambience: I like the décor, with modern and warm tones. I was not too fond of the hard old chairs though, but that's very minor. It was quite hipster.

Food: We were there for a birthday celebration and ordered a social size of the Zucca Ravioli and the Penne Bolognese. We also got The Butcher (pizza) and a Bomba Burrata Mozzarella Ball. In the end, our party wasn't stuffed yet so we ordered another social size of the Classic Spaghetti and Meatballs. I loved all the pasta! They were done al dente just right and were very fresh. The flavours and textures of the dishes were great. The meatball in the spaghetti were huge and so soft and yummy. The pizza (more like a flatbread) was equally delicious! The crust was soft and yummy, the flavours were spot on, and it was not greasy which is always a bonus for me. The only negative one I had was the Mozzarella Ball. The flavours were there but it was just soggy and I personally would've expected to be more cheesy. Plus the crustini provided were quite hard; though it was nice of the server to offer more crustini since the dish came with 4 and we were a party of 5.

I really liked this place and would definitely come back. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I was here for a friend's bday party a couple of months back and the food was really great and tasty. Service was excellent! So for my husbands Bday I decided to rebook at Scaddabush again (same location). The service was still excellent, but the food was not the best this time around. The first time I ordered the salmon and it was so good and the portion was pretty large. So this time I got the salmon again thinking it was going to be as good. This time they made it differently and the filet was about 1/4 of the size. I literally finished it in 3 bites! Also the veggies were not that good. We also ordered the mozzarella burrata was not as soft and fresh as the first time.

Update: We came here again because of convenience and they didnt mix the meat balls correctly and some were so salty and others not salty enough. My pasta was not hot and was very dry. Not enough marinara sauce. Sorry but they need to step it up!"}
{"text":"When you specialize in something...you gotta do it right and these guys really hit it on the money with their fresh mozzarella! It got the buratta - drizzled with honey and truffle oil served with crispy foccaccia bread.  Creamy, sweet, savoury, buttery, to die for! I can literally sit there and eat these all day.  Also had the osso buco bites and my chef fiance who's usually really hard to please with food said it was really good! Flavorful and delicious - a dish i definitely would recommend to every one having dinner there.  

One thing I had to comment on though.  The service was really good, dont get me wrong, but they apologize waaaayyyy too much lol.  I appreciate good service as I work in the industry, but I got 6 apologies in total tonight.  Before during and after they forgot the buratta and before during and after the cappuccino was a little delayed.  They were soooo nice lol  

Definitely going back :)"}
{"text":"I'm so excited that Scaddabush is here in the East Beaver plaza! Alice Fazooli's had been there for over a decade. I've only heard good things about the menu. Came here late night on a Friday during the first couple weeks of the opening. The server invited me to the social club & told me all the features which was nice. She also informed me of all the popular items on the menu. Ordered a white Sangria that was delicious! It had a great variety of fruits. It was too late for the fresh mozzarella so just ended up getting the stuffed meatball! It was fantastic!!!
Ended up ordering a Pesto Pollo & Capri pastas. They both did not disappoint!! You could taste the freshness in the house made pasta! Definitely coming here with a big group so everyone can enjoy the variety of dishes. The pizzas also looked tasty!"}
{"text":"The worst meal my family and I have ever, ever eaten ! The Burrata was chewy and difficult to cut or spread. The pasta has a strange consistency and mine was freezing cold. None of us finished our meals and all of us said that we would never, ever return ! Disgusting does not even come close to describing what we were served !"}
{"text":"Great location and ambience with average food and service. I've been to Scaddabush in Richmond Hill and knew what the expect. 

I came with a group of 7 and made reservations. The restaurant was fairly full on a Thursday night so resos are recommended. Convenient location means great for after work drinks and dinner if you work in the financial district.

I was a bit disappointed with the Polenta Tots we ordered which were better at the RH location. I ordered the Spaghetti and meatball (stuffed). The meatball was huge and flavourful but I found the spaghetti and the sauce sub par. 

Overall, A-OK. Will probably have it on my list of convenient restaurants around work, but won't be in often."}
{"text":"Scaddabush is a 3.5 for me. Overall I find the food a hit or miss. 

I've been disappointed with the flavours and quality of the pasta and pizza which is disappointing since this is an Italian restaurant. Recently had the Pesto pasta where the pesto sauce was way too watery and also lacked flavour. The fresh pepper and cheese we asked for afterwards helped. 

On the positive note, the appetizers are excellent. I particularly like the fried cauliflower / asparagus, aracini and the polenta bites.

The restaurant itself is comfortable and pleasant to sit in. Prices are reasonable and service is fine. 

Although not a top choice for me, I'd visit again and for Italian shops nearby in Markham, it's definitely one to consider."}
{"text":"I will never come back. 

1) Our party was told that there would be no service charge if it unexpectedly got larger than our initial party of 6. Our bills said otherwise.

2) Some portions were outrageously small for the price paid. Specifically the Baked Carbonera, was half the size of a small pasta portion. 

3) The waitress kept thinking our table had not paid for one remaining order when we had all paid and it was a system/human error.  Not the biggest deal as everyone makes mistakes, but also took away from the eating experience. 

4) The charity bread/pasta combos were not deducted from our bills and we had to pay the full individual order prices. 

Sad to say, expected more of the experience at Scaddabush overall, given the good vibes, relatively  good taste, and ambiance of the restaurant itself.

P.S. Frozen ready cut fries from the supermarket is not a good look - more disappointing was how fast that was discovered, from a not picky eater such as myself."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend and 3 friends. 4 ppl including myself were very disappointed with the food. 1 friend didn't make any comment. 

Food - 0 star. Food is either too bland/no taste or too salty. They claim their pasta is freshly made daily, so everyone ordered pasta and we are all very disappointed. The pasta is either over cooked or not fresh at all. The pasta stick together...terrible and bland.

Bruschettas - Avocado and cheese. Too oily and can't taste the goat cheese at all! My hand is full of oil after. 
Straight Up Meatball (Classico) - everyone finds it TOO SALTY.. WAY TOO SALTY. Horrible! Can't finish it. 
Pesto Pollo Fettuccine - Bland. Chicken is too dry. Pasta stick together. Not enjoyable at all. 
My boyfriend ordered Baked Penne Carbonara and I had tried some - TOO SALTY!! 
My other friends ordered Fettuccine Capri and Shrimp Spaghetti. Again, they complaint that the pasta stick together and bland.
Rosemary Garlic Fries - way way way too oily that no one wanted to eat it... We only ate 15% of this side dish.
Overall, the food is too terrible that we didn't want to try their dessert.

Service - 1 star. The waitress was nice but not attentive and Not helpful. Didn't check on us. Didn't ask if we want more water, refill our coffee or pops. I had to request twice to get a cup of hot water. Didn't ask if we want pepper or parmesan cheese when she bought us the main courses. They basically put our food on the table and left. We had to look for her several time whenever we want something.

The overall dining experience was terrible!! I didn't really care about the service but the food was so too bad, too disappointing. We will never be back again.

{"text":"At the last minute we decided to go out for dinner, Scaddabush is located right across the street from the hotel so it was an easy pick. With a convention in town we were told that it would take us 20 minutes to get our table, so we proceeded to the bar to order a drink. The bartender was very nice and brought us our drinks quickly. We no sooner had a couple of sips from our drinks and was informed our table was ready. So it was only a 10 minute wait instead of 20 which was great. We ordered the Balsamic Truffle bread as an appetizer and I ordered the Zucca Ravoli, a butternut squash filled ravioli. Absolutely delicious! I ordered the small plate but wished I had ordered the regular as the ravioli had an amazing flavor - not overpowering with just a hint of sweetness. 
Although the restaurant was very busy, our waiter didn't amazing job taking care of us - never feeling forgotten."}
{"text":"We were here over the Christmas holiday with some friends from Lee's old work, we decided this would be a good place to go to, and we were pretty right!

It was really quiet at the time we visited for lunch, and we were quickly seated. This place is a chain, but it's an upscale one, with a lot of sleek wood and large tables for big groups.

I had the baked penne carbonara, which was pretty good, but I think I probably should have also ordered a salad to go along with it, as my portion seemed a bit small compared to the chicken parmesan that Lee got. I ended up being hungry again before dinner.  

The beer selection here is pretty unremarkable, with a lot of macro beers of middling quality on their draft list. This is only a regional chain, they could probably do with something a little more adventurous than Steamwhistle or Mill Street Organic, but then I am a slightly biased IPA lover, and have to remind myself that most people that go to an Italian restaurant are going to end up drinking wine.

The server was awesome and she really busted her arse in serving our party 5, some of whom were a little pickier than others. 

Overall, it's a chain, but a decent chain, and I'd have no problems coming here for lunch or dinner again."}
{"text":"Came here for a bday dinner on a Saturday. Arrived just before 5:30 and it wasn't busy. I had calamari and the naked mozz to start. Not really a fan of the mozzarella. The calamari, on the other hand, were really good. As for my main, I ordered the Capri but with the shrimp spaghetti sauce. When I got my order I noticed I didn't get the spoonful of what I think is fried garlic but instead found lots of roasted garlic in my dish. It was good but I would have preferred less garlic. Overall the ambiance is nice. It's very cozy and our waiter Denis did a great job in accommodating our table. Would definitely go again and try out their other dishes."}
{"text":"Definitely a little bit of this, a little bit of that, and a whole lot of amazing! We had never been to a Scaddabush before and we were truly impressed. The quality of the food and the service were incredible. Food-wise we ordered many different dishes, everything was delicious but the most memorable were the fresh mozzarella, the burrata, and the meatballs. The pasta and pizza were really good too. The desserts were yummy especially the chocolate toffee jar cake.
But what really makes me want to come back is the service. Our server James was incredible! He was very attentive, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic. He made sure we were happy from beginning to end, and because we were there with a small child he was always making sure we had everything we needed. We'll be coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"My family of 12 and i went to scaddaboush for my moms birthday and had the most amazing time!! (Even my grandparents who are very russian and usually dislike and restaurant thats not russian) we had the big long table in the private room. I dont remember our waitress' name but she was tall and blonde and so accommodating and so sweet! Our food... i personally ordered the beet and goat cheese salad and didnt like it too much but everyone else absolutely loved their meals! We started off with the polenta balls which were honestly to die for... i would never usually order polenta but we loved them so much we got another order of them... i would probably drive back 30 mins for more. We also had some deep fried zucchini to start which were okay, probably wouldn't order those again, tomato soup which was great!! And the garlic bread as well was delicious!!! For some mains we got chicken parm, steak, salmon, veggie pizza, and seafood pasta! Oh and cant forget the butternut squash pasta that I ended up stealing from my aunt. Overall we most definitely enjoyed ourselves and will most definitely be coming back soon! Maybe even for my birthday?"}
{"text":"First tip - do arrive earlier than usual because although the lot is huge, parking can be quite insane on Friday nights. My first impression of this place was that it has a pretty nice rustic feel to it. We came here at around 8pm and there were a lot of people but it was not completely packed. There was a DJ standing near the front door. There's a mixture of booths, high chair/barstools, bar in the middle that looks pretty nice. Like Jack Astors there is also a piece of paper in the middle where you can scribble. Scaddabush is Italian slang for a little bit of everything so we decided to try the Bomba Burratta Fresh Mozarella and the Diavolo Pizza.

The Bomba Burratta is basically cream-stuffed fresh mozzarella with spicy roasted tomato, chilli ragu, and olive oil. When the Bomba Burratta arrived I almost mistakened it for vanilla ice cream lol. But it was actually just a ball of mozzarella that looked like ice cream with some spices on it and a a couple slices of bread on the side. The cheese was not as stringy as I had imagined it to be but it was still okay.

The Diavolo pizza comes with spicy chicken, mozzarella, Pecorino cheese, caramelized onions, roasted grape tomatoes, balsamic reduction. It was almost rectangular shaped and came with pizza scissors that you can use to cut the pizza. The pizza was okay, a little doughy and quite spicy if you normally eat mild food. They put a pretty decent amount of toppings though.

Service was good, the waiters were friendly and helpful. Yelp does not have 0.5 ratings but all in all I would rate this location 2.5/5"}
{"text":"We decided to check out their sangria since I am going through cocktail phase. The sangria was tasty, and generously priced for the size...unfortunately it lacked the kick. 

We ordered the crusted snapper and zuchinni fritti. The fish was perfectly cooked and came with the right amount of vegetables, it was a light but filling entree. The appetizer however was a bit oily, so we were a tad disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been here twice in seven days;  both to say goodbye and hello to teak members. 

One was in the dinning room which was a little noisy but to be expected. We had a great server and their known meatballs everyone loved! 

My first time I had the butternut squash  and sage ravioli which was amazing! The spicy bread crumbles which came om a spoon with the dish was a great touch to add to the texture of the dish.  To drink I had the lemon rosemary smash.  It was refreshing and fragrant even without the alcohol. 

The second time was for dinner as a welcome. We had dinner in the bar a high top table.  The music wasn't nearly as loud which was a plus.  I had the lemon rosemary smash with alcohol and it tasted just as good.  If it came offered as an option  in a pitcher that would be even better!  To eat I had the chicken and sun dried tomato fettuccine. Pasta was good the portion very filling, the dish could've been a bit warmer in temperature but all in all a good solid dish.

 Definitely will be  coming back!"}
{"text":"Very interesting meal at the downtown Scaddabush! All Italian driven. My pizza was large enough but the salt was off the scale even for a pepperoni pizza. Very tasty to say the least. We ordered the Mozzarella cheese plate. Didn't taste like much until you added the pinch of salt they recommend. And then....boom! It exploded in flavour. 

No issue with the service. Would define go again but this time spend more time at the meal."}
{"text":"I was really happy to try the new Scaddabush location right next to where I live. 

Decor is very nice, quite a spacious dinning room that is nicely and soberly decorated. The tables are not crammed next to each other. Music is not too loud so its easy to talk with all the members of your party. 

Our waiter was very pleasant and was good at making wine pairing suggestions. When he was with us he was caring and finny. The only reason I am not giving a full 5 stars review is that it took a very long time between when we got our drinks and the time to order. And again it was very long before we would get the checks and be able to pay. One more detail is that our order of Mozzarella seems it was forgotten and we received it after we started the mains. 

Food wise it was a great experience. I had the chicken limone. A very generous portion. The chicken was zesty and juicy. The potatoes had that great savory taste with the Grana Padano and I really enjoyed the green beans. 

We also shared some fries and mushrooms that were nicely done and were a good sharing portion. 

The best was the freshly made mozzarella. Tasty, moist served with kosher salt and jam. The bread was freshly baked with some olive oil. Clearly one of their items on the menu."}
{"text":"Scaddabush is a pretty decent restaurant. Food was relatively good for the price! I would only suggest that the lighting be a bit better in the restaurant itself. The lights were not even high enough to see the menu, I needed to use my iPhone light to be able to see this. Other than that it was good service and good food for a decent price!"}
{"text":"Birthdays are once a year, but pasta's don't have to be. I visited this restaurant while figuring out where to eat for my birthday celebrations. While on our way to the patio seating, I noticed an elderly man having the shrimp spaghetti. There was wisdom in his eyes, so I went ahead and placed the order. What's the saying about wise old men? Anyway, the pasta was phenomenal and it's my favorite shrimp pasta in the city. You will not be disappointed by the layers of flavor with each bite. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere . Think: upscale East Side Marios."}
{"text":"My 4th time here. Good food. Great service. It took longer than expected to get the main course so we got them for free. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Been to Scaddabush a few times now and I must say that I really like the place.  I like the atmosphere, it has that rustic warehouse feel and they play a good assortment of music.  Each time I've been here, I've tried something different. The first time we came here it was for a friend's birthday party.  The table ordered various appetizers: mozzarella ball (This is their specialty.  You can get three different types and they're made fresh in-house), osso bucco bites (lightly breaded pork bites), spinach and artichoke dip (I think it's more like a 3 cheese dip with sun dried tomatoes and spinach - it's REALLY cheesy!), the stuffed meatball (It's huge and delicious!) and various other dishes that I didn't try them all.  Personally, I think they really specialize in their appetizers.  They are all a good size for sharing and are very tasty.  For my main dish, I decided to try the pasta because it's made fresh daily in-house.  I had the pesto pollo fettuccine (small - they come in three different sizes).  Normally, I'm not a fan of pesto, but I enjoyed this one because it was well flavored, the chicken was moist and juicy and the pasta was amazing!! You can't beat freshly made pasta!! Having tasted several appetizers, unfortunately, I was unable to finish my pasta, but one of my friends decided to polish it off for me and he thoroughly enjoyed it as well.  On a separate occasion, my husband and I came back to have dinner ourselves.  We ordered an appetizer and the meat pizza.  I'm a pizza lover, so I wanted to try it out.  The pizzas here are okay.  I would recommend their appetizers and pastas.  You can't go wrong with them.  Overall, their atmosphere, service and food are good.  Like some of the other reviews, I'd agree that their prices are a little high, but it's not like you're going to eat out everyday, so it's just a nice treat."}
{"text":"I decided to come here for lunch on Sunday as I received a coupon for joining the social club and I had a remaining balance on a previously purchased gift card that I was not able to use my last visit due to lack of training of the staff.

Based on my previous two bad experiences at this restaurant; I would definitely not have come back if there were no promotions and I did not have remaining balance on my gift card.

The lunch menu indicates that the fresh mozzarella is made between 5PM-Close; when we were seated, our server advised us that the fresh mozzarella was made by so and so and gave us a few minutes to look at the menu. When placing our order, I asked whether they had the fresh mozza available (since she introduced it to us) and if so, I would take an order of the \"naked\". Our server said she would check with the kitchen but she thought it would be available.

Five minutes later, our server came back, advised that the kitchen was not ready to prep the mozza and then turned around and walked away in a second. She did not offer or give me a chance to order another appetizer... I had to flag her down and tell her what I wanted; how unprofessional.

We ordered calamari for our appetizer instead and it was quite disappointing. The breading was soft and oily, not crispy..and would crumble off the calamari when being picked up. The lobster spaghetti and stuffed meatball & spaghetti were alright; they arrived and we were not offered any fresh ground pepper or cheese to follow. I had to wait for our server to come back where I once again had to flag her down and request it.

When getting the bill, we paid with the remaining balance of our gift card and surprisingly the server seemed to know how to do that properly; which I am happy to see.

Overall, this Scaddabush location still needs a lot of work on their kitchen and staff."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time I got the seafood pasta and then the second time I had the bacon and egg pizza. The pasta was really good and the sauce was actually flavourful compared to other chain Italian restaurant pastas such as East Side Marios. The pizza scissors were neat. The pizza was good - it had a good crust, but I was disappointed that the egg wasn't cooked into the pizza. Instead a sunny side egg was placed on top of it. We shared a cheesecake which had a berry sauce on the side. The cheesecake wasn't too heavy and was a few bites finished off the meal nicely. 

I spent about $20 on lunch (not including tip). Parking is free in the plaza. 

Our server was really friendly and made the experience more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Food is very good with the exception of the burgers my Co workers got were burnt. I recommend the zucca, steak or chicken Limon all are generous servings and cooked well. This place has a mom and pop type feel where its comfortable and welcoming even when its a multi location restaurant."}
{"text":"The pasta is homemade everyday. I had the fennel sausage fettuccini and it was delicious! Everyone was very satisfied with the meal and the experience. The dessert wasn't the greatest though."}
{"text":"3.5 maybe! It appears that your bill might be heavy, but if you like share-care fundamental, this place is amazing. A large paste portion is good for 2 adults and a kid, along with some 3$/4$ sides. The sides are quite awesome. My favourite being Polenta fries and sauteed mushrooms.

Well, time me and my hubby ordered a Pomodoro pizza, with sides of Polenta tots, Cavatappi Sorrentina pasta and sauteed mushrooms & for drinks I ordered rosemary lemonade. And charity bread. Our bill was around 55 including tip. 

The pizza was crispy and fresh, little greasy, but we loved it. so were our sides except for Cavatappi Sorrentina pasta, so we told our server and she replaced it with Arrabbiata pasta, without any hesitation, it was tangy and tasty. Rosemary lemonade was delicious, not sure how they infused the flavour of rosemary but it was exceptionally good. 
The Polenta Tots, we very crispy and delicious, we really liked them. but I think they should be accompanied by a marinara sauce. We dipped them in our pasta sauce and enjoyed.
The sauteed mushrooms are something my hubby can't get over with and are something for which he will go back to them again.

We might visit their other location which has better ratings next. We also signed up for their social program online, where you get 10$ on 30$.  
I need to try their ravioli & tiramisu for sure.

Our Server, Anna, was a very delightful person, very attentive. Her way of handling difficult clients, sitting across our table, was very impressive."}
{"text":"I won't praise Scaddabush for its authentic Italian food, because it simply does not advertise as one and sure does not try to be one. It serves Italian styled, Italian inspired dishes. For chain restaurants, Scaddabush has to be my top 3 favourites for its service, food, and environment. 

For this location in particular, I have been here more than a dozen times -

It's funny how there is a huge parking lot, yet it is always jam packed around Scaddabush. I feel like I won the jackpot whenever I come here and get a spot nearby. 

Service here is good, just like other locations. They check up on you 2-3 times throughout the meal. They are friendly, always seems like they are having a good time. Ask for recommendations and they can say a lot about the menu! My favourites are the lobster pasta, the meatball, and the bruschettas! The lobster pasta is done exceptionally well at this location compared to the others. 

Wait time is average, but if you come with a large party, it can turn into quite a bit of a wait. Service is always pleasant and I never had a bad time here. They don't rush you even if you order couple drinks and just enjoy an hour or two here.

Make reservations no matter when you come."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper at Scaddabush.  It was a busy spot!

We both ordered a pizza.  Gord ordered a Smoked Bacon & Egg pizza.  Jacob, our server, described it as a \"breakfast pizza\" ... and Gord loves breakfast!  He said it was good and he'd get it again.  I ordered an Americano pizza.  I've had it before and like it."}
{"text":"I had lunch this afternoon at Scaddabush in Richmond Hill.

I ordered what I always get at a Scaddabush ... an Americano pizza. I love love love pizza and they make really good pizzas. Today mine was delicious ... cheesy and loaded with pepperoni.

Amber was my server.  She was friendly and made sure I was well taken care of."}
{"text":"I walked into this place with an air of familiarity....and then it hit me....This is where Alice Fazoolis was.

Fear gripped me like a vice. But we were sitting down and it would be rude to leave. It turns out they wen through a re branding and they changed up their menu/service. 

I must say I was impressed with the changes made. The food is great and decently priced. I highly recommend their named Mozzarella appetizer for the table.

Their pastas were great. I've had the Butternut Squash Ravioli and it comparison to what was offered in the restaurants prior iteration, the addition of more ravioli was welcomed as opposed to only getting 4 on a fancy plate.

Yes you should go here!"}
{"text":"I visited Scaddabush on a Wednesday during lunch. It's a very busy and loud joint since it's in a popular location. It's a very large restaurant. 

Service was professional and fast. I didn't particularly like how low the chairs were compared to the table. It felt very weird to be sitting at the table. The table was just significantly higher. It made for a weird dining experience. The decor on the wall was depicting an Italian lineage. Photos and frames of such of people. 

I really enjoyed the Chicken Parmesan meal. It was a huge chicken breast that was cooked nicely. It was very flavourful. There was a lot of tomato sauce infused with basil. I didn't expect to receive such a huge plate of noodle pasta. In my opinion it was more than one serving of pasta. Nevertheless, it was much appreciated. 

Overall, I would visit Scaddabush again. Probably for a longer dining experience in the evening."}
{"text":"Stopped by here last Friday for dinner for 4 people.  I'd previously been to the Mississauga location and enjoyed it, so thought I'd try this new spot out.  The other 3 had never been to a Scaddabush.

Here are my thoughts:
- DECOR:  Amazing.  They did a phenomenal job redesigning the place from the previous Alice Fazoolis 
- FOOD:  Really good.  I had the big meatball and spaghetti and very much enjoyed it.
- SERVICE:  one of the best waitor I've ever had.  He was thorough, knowledgeable, attentive and most of all quite humorous.

My only somewhat negative was the wait time.  When we called they said it was be a 30-40 min wait, with no reservations.  When we got there it wasn't very packed and they seated us rather quickly.  From taking a quick glance, there were still many empty seats in the place.  Likely because it's a relatively new restaurant.

Overall, a great experience.   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I don't know why I even try these typical chain restaurants. The food wasn't very good but at least it was edible. Service was poor as well. Waitress was busy but their was a lot of staff that weren't helping. No manager anywhere to be found."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was loud with unpleasant music.
Food was expensive but not tasty. 20 dollars for a spaghetti and meatball.
The restaurant was average but it tries to hard to differentiate itself with its cheese.
Only reason why i give it 2 stars is because i reserve 1 star for restaurants that make me sick or uneasy after visiting their establishment."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of four during an evening that was not busy at all (and decent amount of waitresses staffed that night). Took us awhile to get our waitresses' attention and she forgot our order... twice. 

Food: 4/5
In terms of food, I ordered a spinach dip as a starter. It was quite delicious - only bad side to it was that there was not enough bread for the dip. For my entree I ordered a fettuccine Capri and substituted it with alfredo sauce. Overall, I thought the portion was quite generous (ordered a regular size) with a good amount of seafood. Only downside was that the actual alfredo sauce didn't have the creamy consistency I liked 

Service: 1/5 
Waitress took way too long to service us and there were no issues with understaffing. We asked to get the dessert menu right after we placed our initial order and she didn't get it to us until the very end. Also forgot our orders numerous times. The only plus side was that they had a live DJ with good music sense. 


I would go again, but I'd go to the Mississauga location instead (better service!)"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service isn't so good. Our server took our orders and basically never came back to check up on us.  The environment is nice."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the food and the service! 
We had 2 young kids in strollers and perhaps because it was non-peak time (pre- dinner rush) the service was excellent. They had plenty of staff on hand for the long weekend. 

We weren't very hungry so ordered one thing at time in terms of food. Each thing was good so we would order another. Also, as it wasn't busy, we weren't waiting long for our food. 

We started with a pitcher of their new green sangria which tasted good but wasn't very strong. They bring you glasses full of ice to go with it. Next time I would ask for ice on the side. 

For apps we started with polenta fried bites & we all agreed they were good. You get about 10-11 bites on a plate. 

Next we ordered garlic bread which was also good and had a few chill flakes sprinkled on. By a few I mean you could count them and there was maybe 5-6 individual flakes. Ha.  

Then, again to share, we ordered fettuccini with spicy sausage. The pasta was home made and fresh. The Parmesan cheese that was freshly shredded had flavour. And I love freshly ground black pepper on my Italian food. Unfortunately I find less and less places are doing this and it's noticed and disappointing. But here they do it without prompting! 

The teenager with us ordered the chicken and avocado BLT sand which. She said it was good. Comes with a side salad or fries. She ate half and the 4 yo ate the rest as without prompting they brought us a to go container! Really good service today. 

The service was excellent through out the meal. Once the 1 yr old woke up it was easy and fast to get a high chair.  

I can see how it depends who is working and how busy it is in regards to the service you get. 

Surprisingly good experience! I would go back to sit on their patio and enjoy a nice pasta or pizza sans kids. 
The patio seating was comfortable too and the way it's designed with high light collided wood dividers between the patio and sidewalk. It doesn't feel like you're in the heart of downtown. It felt relaxing but again it could be that we were in between the lunch and dinner rush. 

Another plus, the music wasn't too loud! But it was there so it drowned out others convo at other tables. 

I would go again and I would recommend for families with kids if you have a late lunch or early dinner. 

Our bill came to $90 for a pitcher of sangria; chicken BLT sand which w/ side salad; polenta bites as app; garlic bread; and one main course size pasta wish spicy sausage.

I'm giving it a 4/5 because I worry that during rush hour our experience would not be as good in terms of customer service, welcoming young kids, space on patio, and quality and speed of getting food to the table."}
{"text":"The fresh mozzarella ! Enough said! I highly recommend the one with the cured ham. I didn't appreciate the atmosphere. I'm not fond of the mismatched furniture and the seats are painfully uncomfortable (unless you get a booth). Staff are friendly and mingle well with the guests. I found Wait time for food even when the restaurant isn't busy to be too long."}
{"text":"Came here early at around 6pm, the service was really good and the food came out on time. The last time I was here was when Alice Fazoolis was open, the interior is pretty much the same - almost unchanged. But there is a new, revamped menu, in which we tried 3 dishes. We had the spinach and artichoke dip with bread, the pasta carbonara in a hot plate with a sunny side egg on top and finally the butternut squash ravioli.

The spinach and artichoke dish was comparable to other restaurants around the same level that make spinach and artichoke dishes. The carbonara was better than other carbonaras I've tried from restaurants at a similar tier. It was baked and put in a hot place so cheese was crispy and then they add parmesan cheese on top to make it even more tasty. Finally the butternut squash ravioli was so good, I savoured every bite of it. 

They have a lot of dishes that are meant to be shared, and they have various sizes for many of the dishes from small, regular and \"social\" which is larger than regular and is meant to be shared among several people.

I'll definitely be back to try this place again, though the dishes were more on the expensive side, coming to around $16-$20 for most of the pasta dishes and all the entrees were above $20 (probably averaging around $25)."}
{"text":"Went here with a few friends for dinner on a Friday night. I ordered the basil pesto chicken linguini. My boyfriend ordered the spaghetti and stuffed meatball. His sauce was nothing special, but the stuffed meatball was delicious. My pasta on the other hand was tasteless. Like even devoid of salt. We'd heard great things about the place but after spending $50 for a drink and pasta each, just didn't seem worth it. Much better options in Toronto."}
{"text":"4th time here, is that saying something? YESSSS! I have to admit, I'm not a huge fan of Italian food, but, this place is definitely my go to spot for pizza/pasta! I came here for a late birthday celebration with 3 of my friends (wooo to turning old/closer to retirement :) ) and they definitely enjoyed their time.

Review of Scaddabush - Front/Simcoe 4.5/5
Order: 
1) Large Zucca Ravioli $19.97
- Buttersquash Ravioli 
- Order this! There is about 10 ravioli, which looked underwhelming first, but have to admit, it was quite filling. This is a great plate to share with another friend if you are ordering another entree like a pizza. 

2) Smoked Bacon & Egg Pizza $15.96
- double-smoked bacon, mushrooms, cracked egg in the middle
- Yes, you read right, a cracked egg in the middle 
- Didn't expect the pizza to be good (I don't like bacon, but it was highly recommended), but it was definitely something I thoroughly enjoyed - just don't expect bacon strips

Overall:
- This was definitely a day of first's - ordering vegetarian ravioli and bacon on pizza? I must've hit my head on a rock that day, but glad I went outside my comfort zone. My friend and I decided to share because we wanted to try something new. The server we had was amazing because she was attentive, patient, and we practically ordered everything she recommended. Did I tell you to try the sangria? They have this fruity, delicious sangria - get the white wine (you don't taste the wine) which it makes it seem like you are drinking juice! 
- It was nice of my friends to get me the Tiramisu dessert which included a sparkler! - if you love Tiramisu, get this as this is by far, the best Tiramisu I have had everrr (made in house too)

Will I come back - no doubt, returning next month for sure! 

Helpful Tips

- Address: 200 Front St. West (about a 7-9 minute walk from Union Station)
- Order: Large Zucca Ravioli, Naked Mozzerella ball, Pesto Pollo Fettucini, Tiramisu, Sangria with white wine, Siganure Meatball Sandwich (I've had all of these lol, i swear i have pictures to prove it) 
- Where to sit: If you want a real experience, sit by the kitchen (open-concept) with the high top tables where you can see the employees make the mozzerella/pizza - great dining experience
- Methods of Payment: cash, debit, credit"}
{"text":"Fresh mozzarella was made fresh daily and served with sliced toasted focaccia, prosciutto, and fig jam.  Very tasty and would reco.  3 stars because the other dishes were just ok.  The salad was pretty oily and with large uncut leaves; the meatball in the spaghetti was good but noodle was just avg.  We also ordered a pitcher of sangria, it was filled with half pitcher of ice... for $27.  With all the choices in this area, not sure I would go back again."}
{"text":"Try their Mozzarella balls!  It's the best thing ever!  There is a TV show called the \"Best Things I ever ate.\"  If I was was on that show I would say that Scaddabush makes the best Mozzarella balls!  They are freshly made after 5 and so fantastic.  The rest of the menu is really good as well.  This restaurant is now a spot that my husband and I go to at l east 3 times a month.  The service is great and the food is delicious!  BTW Scaddabush, please bring back the Venngo discount!  Please please please!!!"}
{"text":"DENNIS THE RACIST.

So this is my second trip to this Scaddabush location. Both times I was seated in the section by a server named Dennis. And as bad as my first trip here, the second was worse. We waited 10 mins before a different server named Dave (sweet Asian guy) came and asked us if we wanted anything to start. He said our server was \"busy\", but our server seemed to only chat up tables with white folks in them. We already knew what we wanted and we ordered everything with Dave. But it made me upset that our server had not even said a simple, \"be right with you\", so I asked one of the hostesses if we can be seated in Dave's area as I was not going to tip Dennis at all. She came back and said Dave will now be your server, and while he was helping others a simple, how are your drinks, etc. At the end of the night, I asked Dave if Dennis was a racist -- he said \"you wouldn't be the first to complain about it\". 


Moral of the story: Great Mozzarella, Dave was very polite and the reason why I didn't eat elsewhere, and lastly, Scaddabush should consider hiring non-racist and prejudice servers such as Dennis (older man with glasses)."}
{"text":"First time here today. Receptionist took my cell# and I got an SMS when our turn came. Wait time was around 12 mins. Décor & ambience are nice. Chairs that we were sitting on - not so much: wobbly and unstable. We were seated at a small bar height table. On order: Caesar and Bacon & Egg pizza.  Caesar: tasted good, I would say above average - a hint of garlic was very welcome, if anything there could be slightly more dressing, but it was good overall. Now, pizza (we waited maybe 15 mins): good size, surprisingly heavily spiced, dough is light and properly cooked, eggs were perfect, lacked salt a little and there was no salt at the table.  
Overall: service was good, but small issues like tiny plates, the fact that you have to specifically ask servers to change them between courses (otherwise you end up eating pizza from your salad plates), wobbly chairs, no salt & pepper at the table - all these small annoyances leave you disappointed: food is good, especially considering the price point, but there's definitely room for growth in creating a good overall experience that matches this great food."}
{"text":"Never disappoint me!!! I don't know how much more I can day that I haven't said already.

We went I  for lunch one gloomy Saturday and our moods were lifted by the fantastic service and food.

Delicious drinks...delicious food...friendly waitress...perfect!"}
{"text":"Servers are really great and the pasta is sooo good! They also have the option a small/regular size so it is perfect for when you want to grab a lunch but don't want to fall asleep at your desk after when you return to work :) 

The decor inside is also really nice and the place is HUGE! 

They have a pretty cool selection of beers and the wine list is not crazy expensive like at other places. 8)"}
{"text":"Scaddabush kinda reminds me of Eastside Mario without the unlimited bread and salad. It's a growing chain of restaurants serving \"so call\" authentic Italian food. My expectation going in was quite high so perhaps I set myself up for a disappointment. 

As a group, we shared the Ravioli, fettuccini Capri, shrimp spaghetti, pizza and the meatball sandwich. We all thought the shrimp spaghetti was the best dish on the table and everything else was just average. It either lacked flavour (fettuccini) or too much flavour (pizza).  The meatball was not bad but somewhat dry in a sandwich. Maybe it's better with their Sunday sauce. 

The ambience is good with a DJ playing the latest tunes however, it may be a bit too loud for younger children. 

Tip: if you join their social club, you will get $10 off your meal over $30!!"}
{"text":"Delicious. The ravioli was spectacular and I won't forget it anytime soon. As a matter of fact, I will be coming to the city just to eat it again. I also had the bread and a salad that is also worth mentioning. 
All around it was way better than I expected."}
{"text":"Okay just come here for the house made cheese

That's all you need to know. The mozzarella is beyond words, especially paired with honey... wtf never would have thought that was a good mix but DAMN it was good. Forgot what it was called. But it comes with 4 pieces of toasted bread to pair it off and I savoured every last bite.

I ordered the Tuscan salad with a side of grilled chicken. Not a fan. Salad was...salad and the chicken was pretty dry. Might as well have not ordered it.

Staff was great. Cheese was phenomenal. The end."}
{"text":"As my favourite Arnold has said...\"I'll Be Back..\" I am not typically into Italian restaurants - certainly not because I don't like Italian cuisine, but quite the opposite. I grew up with my Grandma's cooking and I can't quite seem to find anywhere that compares. 
Now, I won't say that Scaddabush is comparable, but it had enough different options that I definitely found something that I loved and would return for. 
Having never been to Alice Fazoolis, I was coming in fresh with no expectations. The place itself was pretty awesome, loved the decor and wood and candles....a nice touch is the mix n' match plates that really make you feel like you're eating at someone's house! 
After much contemplation, I wound up ordering the Grilled Prosciutto/Provolone sandwich with fig jam. It was such a weird combo that I figured it MUST be good...I was not wrong! I savoured every bite of this wonderful sandwich and the garlic & rosemary fries were pretty great as well. The girl sitting across from me got the mammoth meatball sandwich (I think I read 1/2 pound...??) and boy, did it look good too! A little too huge for me though, I was definitely happy with my choice. We also got a charity bread for the table, and it was very similar to the pan bread at Jack Astor's (meaning: delicious!). I'll donate to that charity any day!
I'd like to try the in-house mozzerella next time..not sure why I didn't this time, but I'll fix that!"}
{"text":"SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM TO SEE HOW TO GET $10 OFF $30 @ Scaddabush

This is my 3rd time coming to Scaddabush. I came when they opened, for my birthday and for valentines day. 

Inside Scaddabush looks very nice and Italian. The lighting is lower, but thats good because its really easy on the eyes. They also sometimes light the candles over your table ( im sure if you asked they would)

The food quality its astonishingly good. I recommend getting the mozzarella cheese with extra bread (no extra cost) as it is really good and made fresh daily. You can even watch then make it.

I also recommend you get the Pesto Pollo pasta 10/10 . If i don't know what to order this is my go too.

The service was nice, but on valentines day it took a little longer than usual (we went around 3 and it wasn't busy at all) which annoyed me. 

I would defiantly go back if I'm craving really good Italian food. 

Cost=$$$ for 2 people

{"text":"Came here for the first time for a long overdue meet up with my girlfriend and her family. This place was definitely vibing, romantic date night at a French or Italian restaurant. Nevertheless, we were here with her children and many other children for that matter.

It's such a friendly environment and although there were candles on some of the tables. It wasn't reachable by children. 

We were very well greeted and our server was fantabulous! He was funny and made conversation with us the minute we sat down. He described most of the menu to us before we even asked.

The pasta was superb! I had the Alfredo chicken and chicken was tender and juicy. They also suggested to put extra Parm on top for a little hint of salty! Which was awesome ! I love fresh cheese and fresh pepper! They did both of that! 

Their kids menu was also very well matched with ice cream sundae on the side and salad! Super healthy and fun!"}
{"text":"Best atmosphere

Parking is hard to find on weekends 

Overall amazing place. I Always go there when I can

{"text":"I had an late lunch/early dinner with a friend here after the yoga conference. I ordered the mixed greens salad with salmon. It was good,healthy and simple, which is what I was after. For dessert my friend and I shared the Chocolate toffee jar cake. That was totally delicious and decadent. We had a nice waitress and our food came pretty promptly so I have no complaints at all. The place is nice. It has a kind of upscale pub type atmosphere. Washrooms were clean as well (one of my pet peeves). Didn't this location used to be a Lonestar? Anyway, yes I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Its the second time I'm there, very tasty Italian cousin, I will be back."}
{"text":"NAKED MOZZARELLA AND ZUCCA RAVIOLI!!!

Whenever I go to Scaddabush, I would always get the Naked Mozzarella. The Naked Mozzarella is made fresh and it tastes delicious and savory with the crostini and tomato jam. If you run out of the crostini and/or the tomato jam, you'll be able to ask for more. 

I tried the Zucca Ravioli for the first time because of all the good things I heard about it, and it was way better than I expected. It's really creamy and flavorful with the hazelnut sauce and the butternut squash filling! Don't forgot to ask your server to grate some parmasean for you! Out of all the pastas I've tried in Scaddabush, the Zucca Ravioli would be my favorite. 

Service is really good and fast and I do like the whole Scaddabush environment too! I was very filled after finishing my Naked Mozzarella and my large Zucca Ravioli. Maybe next time I'll get a small."}
{"text":"Food- just okay. Nothing amazing. To be honest, it gets heavy and not very enjoyable towards the middle. Creative with the items on the menu. Ordered the baked carbonara and chicken Alfredo. Enjoyed it but not a huge fan about going back. I came here before and their mozerella is amazing. Freshly made. Would come back here for their mozerella. 

Price- about $15-30

Service- pretty busy. Not amazing. Kept forgetting water and tended to wait for it.

Overall - just okay."}
{"text":"Pasta is average at best. Italian burger is alright."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd visit to this restaurant and have recommended this place to every friend that I know. Today's experience would make this visit as my last one. We ordered pasta pollo fettuccine past as irecommended by them to be available in vegetarian option. So we ordered same dish without chicken and expecting this place to have high standards in considering dietary restrictions was vain. They served pasta with chicken which means nobody double checked my order. Sorry so say but you spoiled my weekend even before it started. Restaurant is for fun and family time and not for agony and pain. Bye bye scaddabush."}
{"text":"We ordered four shareable plates.  The naked mozzarella, the bomba burrata, the osso bucco bites and zucchini fritti.  All were good but the naked mozzarella, served with sea salt, tomato jam and crostini was by far my favourite.  I enjoyed it much more than the Bomba Burrata because those other bold flavors competed with taste of the mozzarella which is and should be the star of the show.  

The zucchini fritti was tasty but a little on the oily side for me.  The osso bucco bites were good.  I would most definitely order the naked mozzarella again and would probably try other dishes instead of the other three listed in this review for variety."}
{"text":"I love scaddabush. My first experience with this franchise was a few years ago at the downtown location and the baked penne carbonara convinced me that it was one of the best things I've ever eaten. It was cheesy, savoury, salty, sweet, bacony-- ah it was just SOOO good! 

When this location opened up I was SUPER excited. The ambience was relaxing and it's the perfect place to catch up with friends. I brought my friend to this restaurant once and we were hooked. We frequented this location MANY more times. Each time we would order the carbonara (because when something is delicious, why wouldn't we order it every time) and we'd try out a diff pizza (my favourites are the primavera (vegetarian) and diavolo). Their menu is just so good, everything I've ever ordered was delicious--pastas, pizzas, meatballs--so cheesy, so many carbs, so good. 

Recently, I came with a large group who decided to order individually. I think this group was not very impressed with their dinner here and I think that is partly because we didn't SHARE the dishes we ordered. Indeed, when I only ordered the carbonara all for myself, I found it a bit much and my overall experience did not feel as well rounded. My coworker had ordered the zucca ravioli which I had really enjoyed previously because it was very buttery and creamy. She however did not enjoy it, and when I had a bite of her dish it WAS a little more sour/lemony than I remembered. This might be the first time out of the MANY times I've been here that I didn't really enjoy my meal!! I will give scaddabush another chance since they have been so consistent so far. Thus, I will give them 4 stars even though the meal I had this time was more of a 3 :P

When compared to their downtown location....Richmond hill is not as good. Every inch of the Pomodoro pizza in Downtown was packed with tomatoes, but the one in Richmond hill only had a few pieces. Similarly the primavera has fewer veggie pieces too. 

Overall, I like this location--ambience is nice, food is always flavourful and delicious (if you order the right things), and service is good. However, if you really want to enjoy your time here, I suggest you order the meatballs, carbonara, a pizza, maybe a pitcher of sangria, etc etc then share everything among your group! Try a bit of everything and you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"I knew they have a location in downtown, so I was actually hoping this place wouldnt be like the usual mediocre franchises. But, I was disappointed. I probably would have prefered going to Moxies instead.

The giant 1/2 pound stuffed meatball ($13) 
This giant meatball was served on top of a toast, drenched in their special sauce. The restaurant was really dark so it was hard to see all the ingredients. The meatball was stuffed with ricotta cheese and chopped bacon. It was a bit salty but tastey. The toasted almonds added a nice crunch to the dish. I would have perfected it to be served hot as opposed to warm. 

Capri fresh pasta (small plate for $13.50)
Freshly made fettuccine with shrimp, scallops, PEI mussels, squid, roasted red peppers, scallions, lemon zest, tomato sauce. I did not like lemon zest which came in almost every bite. There were quite a lot of seafood which was good but the pasta itself was disappointing. This restaurant is known for its fresh pasta but it didnt taste any different than normal pasta to me. The sauce tasted bland. 

Bacon and egg pizza ($16) 
The pizza came with smoked bacon, mushrooma, onions, chillis, mozzarella, chilli oil with a freshly cracked egg. This pizza was a bit too spicy for me, which I was suprised since western food normally aren't that spicy. They have pizza and beer pairings on Wednesday, but only for specific pizzas."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the atmosphere here. It is elegant but has a rustic feel to it. I really like how they make and hand stretch their mozzarella right in front of you. The spinach and artichoke dip is probably the best if ever tasted. I also had their penne bolognese which was a little spicy, but really tasty. I would definately recommend coming here. I will be back to try the pizza for sure!"}
{"text":"Definitely was not happy with my visit. 

Seafood pasta should never taste as if it was recooked in tomato sauce... Extremely disappointed and service was just not very attentive especially for an empty restaurant."}
{"text":"We went here for a rush lunch during a convention at the metro convention centre. Good bruschetta and garlic fries. My meatball sandwich was good but uneven salting. They did a great job on rushing the food even though they had a full house. Will try here again. their lounge is not first come first serve, it is only so at the bar top. We like the location, right across the street from the north building of metro convention centre."}
{"text":"Dined here with my parents and sisters Thursday night. They sent a $25 off coupon (for orders of $50+) as a promo to introduce this new restaurant. This was originally an Alice Fazoolis, inside looks the same, different table set ups and the menu is different and better! The fresh mozzarella was very tasty. My father loved the meatball he ordered. All the items we ordered were great. We were served by the lovely Cristina who is super sweet and a great waitress! Can't wait to return next time I am in Ontario."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with our experience here tonight. We came having previously been to the Etobicoke location, where we had a really enjoyable evening and a lovely meal.

At this location, we were sat down 25 mins late after they gave away our reserved table to someone else. The mozzarella was noticeably lacking in  texture, our pasta dish (the same dish we ordered at the other location) was bone dry with next to no sauce. I've never eaten a pizza with so many ingredients which still fails to deliver any flavour at all. 

Our server didn't check back with us once, despite both having empty glasses throughout our meal. Explained our disappointment at the end of the meal and the pasta was taken off the bill and we were given a free dessert which was a nice gesture but we were both really looking forward to having a comparable experience to the one we had at the Etobicoke restaurant and were thoroughly disappointed."}
{"text":"One thing's for sure - Scaddabush is consistently average across all of the locations I've visited (Richmond Hill, Mississauga, Downtown TO), so I've got to give them that. But although they're consistent, I just wish for more out of the food.

I had the Butcher pizza at this location. More flavourful than the Smoked Bacon and Egg one I had in Richmond Hill. You could tell this place was more liberal in their seasoning.

I feel like Scaddabush could do so well with a DIY menu. There are so many times where I've wanted x pasta with y sauce, but they couldn't accommodate it. 

One thing that will leave an imprint for me at this location is the fact that the server wouldn't let us move to a different table since the one we were in was right beside the doors. Our food was cold the minute it hit our table. They even told us that it wasn't reserved, yet no one was sitting there at all... If anything, a curtain wrapping around the seats near the door for this table could've made our (and other customers who have to, unfortunately, sit at this table as well) experience better."}
{"text":"I've been to this Scaddabush location several times in the past 2 years, and I've had mixed experiences every single time. Don't get me wrong, I think the service is fine - my irk lies within the dining room floor: the kitchen. Here's a few times that I can recall.

1st visit - Fairly new, as they took over Alice Fazoolis and the food was really good! They had pasta with a spicy tomato sauce that would make you do anything but \"fuhgeddaboudit\"!

2nd visit - Company Christmas party and experienced their set course menu. Nothing special, but it wasn't as good as the first visit.

3rd visit - Pizza was alright... think it was their meat lover's pizza (or whatever their equivalent is). Nothing special here either.

Recent visit - Got their Smoked Bacon and Egg Pizza... really bland - needed to find that smoked bacon for any ounce of flavour, and it was pretty sparse...

It hurts me to see a restaurant do so well at the beginning only to have their food quality drop over the last few years... 

Maybe I'll reconsider the fuhgeddaboudit..."}
{"text":"Nice strong flavorful drinks. Pasta portions are kind of small. Bar area is spacious. Very friendly waiters."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends for some late night dinner.  The ambience was lively and the decor of the restaurant was pretty nice.  Where it fell short was the taste.  I ordered their fettuccine Capri which had some seafood such as mussels, squid, and shrimp in a tomato based sauce.  The dish looked very good but it was very bland and the mussels were super small.  A couple of my friends ordered the same dish and all had similar reviews.  Other people ordered their massive meatball dish and even that wasn't anything special.  I might give this place another try some other time but was a bit disappointed on my first experience.  On a positive note, the service was good and friendly."}
{"text":"Their fresh mozzarella are to die for here! My friends and I always order the mozzarella and prosciutto plate for appetizer and it is never a disappointment. I could just only eat that as my main if I could. However, I recently went back during a weekend night and they were jammed packed. Wait time was at least an hour for a table. They used to take reservations on the weekend and was told they don't anymore, which was a bummer."}
{"text":"Sub-par italian food. 

Environment is nice, but it really is just another big chain restaurant.

We each ordered a pasta dish. My friend got the lobster pasta - definitely not worth the price tag. Small amounts of not very good lobster and there was a large section of pasta that was sauce-less. He tried to mix it around, but the sauce to pasta ratio was just not right. He showed the server who absolutely agreed, yet instead of replace the dish they said they will just bring him more -sauce to add-in (mistake #1 - this was their error and they should have just replaced his dish). It then took 20 bloody minutes for this holy cup of f rose sauce to come. I really can't comprehend this delay as I assume they have a big vat of sauce in this kitchen. Anyways, at this time his pasta was cold (as was mine as I was waiting for him to eat). So we told the server of the annoyance and he said (mistake #2) \"ok. enjoy your meals!\". Ok then. 

Overall, despite the cold pasta and stupidity, the food was alright. His sauce was good (too bad the pasta was COLD) and I got some lemon cream sauce pasta which was also not too bad. 

Food and atmosphere maybe 3 stars but they only get 1 due to their dumbass service."}
{"text":"The last time I went to Scaddabush I was actually disappointed. However, I decided to visit them once again. This time, the experience is very positive. The calamari, pasta, steak, zeppole (sp?) are above par and the service was amazing too. 

The price is a tad on a high side but you actually get more than what you paid for at this restaurant!"}
{"text":"A failure to launch!
This brand has build up some good hype taking over the old Alice Fazoolis which wasn't a top winner out of the Cara group..
All locations are nicely designed from the inside, with average looking patios..again, not much work was done taking over Fazoolis, so the whole Italian theme and atmosphere was kept, which is a great thing.
so the only thing really left was to come up with something extra ordinary in terms of menu and service, since all locations have that crowd coming into the restaurant in the first place, since all spots were originally Fazoolis, but unfortunately this isn't the case.

I've been here and at another location about three - four times, the food was my least favorite, always greasy and extremely overwhelming with oregano and other Mediterranean spices.
Service is nothing to brag about as well..
It needs a quick revamp of the menu, adding new and exciting mains and appetizers rather than the usual while keeping it original and connected to their Italian Roots."}
{"text":"Ate here while attending a conference at ACC. Noisy. Service slow but apologetic. Kitchen mixed up my order. Server made it right. Had chicken avocado BLT. Mediocre."}
{"text":"I used to come to this restaurant all the time when it was Alice Fazooli's. The staff and managers are extremely nice, polite and friendly. This review and its one star therefore is certainly NOT about any of them. 

Rather, since this location has now become Scaddabush, the vegan options have disappeared off the face of the menu. Every single thing has a dairy, cheese, egg, or meat origin, unless you customize one of their pizzas, but there's only so many times you can order that. You can't order the bread, salads, ANY of the pastas, and no desserts either. 

I don't know who's decision it was to switch the restaurant, moreover, switch it to such a limited menu, but this decision marginalized many vegans and vegetarians who simply cannot come to the restaurant anymore. Fresh pastas are okay, but that means they are made with egg, I mean did no one think of this?"}
{"text":"Came here for my partner's birthday. Served by a young man who was somewhat attentive; I found myself looking for him a few times. A mistake he made was left on the bill and I handed him my credit card before the cheque had actually arrived at the table. I should've checked the bill more and I suggest future patrons do so when dining there. I think better communication could have prevented this. 

 The food was very good. Had the Beet Salad, Caprese, Charity bread and calamari for appetizers. The bolognese was very good as well. Margherita pizza was excellent. I'd come back for the food for sure."}
{"text":"I was lurked into Scaddabush again with offers from the mail. Free appetizer worth $15?!

Service is good this time around.

Calamari Fritters and Fettuccine Capri were standard. But sadly Parmesan Crusted Snapper ($23) which I ordered last visit and enjoyed was not good. Fish itself was mushy and the crust was overseasoned. 

Maybe not to order any main entree and just stick with pasta/pizza.

Food really going downhill compares to early days. But I guess it is happening with a lot of restaurants."}
{"text":"It's always very lively and busy! Great place to go for a quick bite and drinks with some friends after work. As busy as it was, the service was still decent!

The mozeralla ball is to die for! A must try!!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop for lunch or dinner. The menu has a lot of options including sandwiches, pizza and pasta. Everything looks amazing. I went with a grilled cheese with prosciutto and fig jam. The serving I got was a great size, I had leftovers! The food is all very tasty. I will say this place is a little pricey though."}
{"text":"I love coming here. It is a very aesthetic restaurant and good for a casual and/or fancy night out. There is a DJ so it is more lively in there during weekend nights when he starts bumping his tracks. 

Another thing I am impressed with is how every Scaddabush location delivers good quality food AND service. This is something that is very rare with other establishments so its a fresh of breath air to not have to worry about quality when trying out a new location. 

In my opinion Scaddabush is an American style Italian restaurant so a lot of people may be disappointment for not experiencing the authentic Italian way. I hope that anyone new will keep an open mind when coming here because it is a very vibrant restaurant with great food!"}
{"text":"Two nights in a row, we went here for dinner because it was located directly across from our hotel. At first we went because it was convenient. The second time we went because we remembered how good the experience and food were the night before.

They make homemade pasta every day. They also have a special chef that comes in and makes their mozzarella fresh each night. My daughter really loved their Caprese salad with the truffle oil. It was really good!

Our waiter said I must try their meatball. I say meatball because you only get one of them but it is really big. I noticed all the tables around me had one on their table too ... because our server loves it so much he's great at explaining that people should try it. I was glad I did!

My daughter really enjoyed their polenta tots. However, the tots were not consistent from one day to the other. The first time we had them, they were crunchy on the outside and very soft on the inside. It was really a nice contrast. The second time we had them, they were not as crunchy on the outside so it seemed a little mushy. In addition, the second night we got half the size portion then we did the first night. 

Both evenings, we had fantastic service. I would say the service definitely gets five stars while the food and inconsistency brought it down to four.

Would we go back again? Yes! And I hope we get one of the servers we had last time because they really made our visit feel special."}
{"text":"The fresh momozzarella with fig jam and prosciutto is pretty spectacular!  (I'd not had fresh moz before trying it here) 

Unfortunately, the music is just sooo painfully loud, conversation is difficult, unless you enjoy screaming (!), and it feels like a bar instead of a restaurant.   

For some reason, best known to the parent company, SIR, management refuses to lower the volume. (BTW.  SIR stands for service inspired restaurants....Can we say, ironic, anyone?!)

I have heard, from speaking with staff in SIR's restaurants (Jack's and Scaddabush), that more than JUST a couple of very nice, talented and YOUNG, 23 to 30 year olds now suffer from significant hearing loss.  PERMANENT DAMAGE, my yelping friends.  Without the 6 or 7 thousand dollars they will soon need for quality hearing aids.  It's shocking.  And a significant health issue, for both guests and staff."}
{"text":"The food here is great and priced fair but the service needs improvement our table wasn't visited as often and almost no servers were in our area. All in all I was pretty satisfied and will come back."}
{"text":"SCADDABUSH  moved it after the demise of Alice Fazooli. Both owned by the same corporation.  SCADDABUSH is Italian slang for a bit of everything, which is what their menu is all about. 

Lively music, friendly server, large menu, average to below average food - sums up our experience at SCADDABUSH. 

Appetizer: 

Caprese $15.52  - Fresh mozzarella, Campari tomatoes, baby arugula, herb oil, basil, balsamic reduction was a hit! We both enjoyed the salad a lot. The salad was reminiscent the caprese salad I had in Italy. 
 

Bruschettas Classico (Half) $6.77 - Satisfy our bruschetta cravings with fresh tomato, cheese, and basil. 

Polenta Tots (Side) $4.97 - Deep fried polenta topped with cheese. Slightly dry. Nothing to write home about.

Main:
Primavera $16.47 - Pizza topped with Mozzarella, San Marzano tomato sauce, grilled zucchini, eggplant, roasted red peppers and grape tomatoes, caramelized onions, green and black olives. Again, dry seems to be a theme for everything we ordered at Scaddabush. 


Tomato caper salmon $24.66 - Grilled Jail Island salmon, topped with white wine tomato caper sauce, crispy rosemary potatoes, and seasonal vegetables. The overall dish was exceedingly greasy. it was even greasier than John Travolta's hair in Grease. Strangely enough, the salmon was slightly dry even with all the oil. It also did not tastes fresh. Perhaps the salmon took a little too long travelling from Jail Island in New Brunswick. 

The highlight of our meal was the DJ and the caprese salad. While I would not recommend going out of your way to try SCADDABUSH, if you are in the area and are out of food options, it's a mediocre choice."}
{"text":"Was a great place to eat. I'm glad they replaced the Alice Fazolis because this is actually a place I'd go to eat. Really the pasta options. Great ambiance. Open concept makes it a tad loud for intimate conversation, but if you're not looking for a quiet setting this is decent. Ambiance is great! Dimly lit with a woody interior makes you feel like you're having a classy Italian dinner in a wine cellar. Would come again for the ambiance."}
{"text":"Scaddabush is one of the newest restaurant in the financial district. I came here for dinner with co-workers from our offices in the US. It was quite busy for a Tuesday night, so I recommend a reservation.

The waitress was very helpful in providing recommendations. But since Scaddabush is known for its meatballs, I knew what I was going to order. We started with a plate of bomba burrata mozzarella. It came with toasted bread, slices of tomato and slices bacon. The bacon provided a nice saltiness to it all. I'm not a mozzarella connoisseur, bit it reminded me of cheese curds that squeak when you bite into it. 

The spaghetti and meatball were very tasty. It was indeed a singular meatball :) I ordered the stuffed meatball, which is stuffed with mozzarella. I couldn't tell that it was homemade pasta, but it definitely tasted different than pre-made pasta. The meatball was huge and is quite filling. Like the meatball, I was stuffed by the end of dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for a bachelorette dinner party and tried the salad, carbonara and their burrata cheese.

Food isn't too bad and the place is pretty nice just really busy and the service is a little slow.

I probably won't come back here unless it's a special occasion"}
{"text":"Really good Italian food! Normally I tend to stay away from chain restaurants when it comes to stuff other than burgers and pizza but I have to say I was very impressed with this place!

I had chicken parm which was very tasty and crispy, it came with a side of pasta which was really good as well. Overall the portions are great considering the price and I will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"Cool place with an Italian American rustic theme going on. Possibly one of the best places to get as close to real Italian food as possible. The Mario pizza was well done too and was very well prepared. Also get a ball of mozzarella there too. It looks cool and tasted awesome. Eat well friends!"}
{"text":"The highlight of this this place is that they make mozzarella and pasta fresh on location daily.

We both shared a mozzarella appetizer. A lot of yelpers raved about the Burrata (infused with honey and truffle cream) so we decided to give it a try. It was just okay in mind opinion, not worth the $13. I likely won't get it again. It's only worth about $8 IMO.

The fresh pasta dishes were quite delicious. We had Pesto pollo and Capri. We were happy with both dishes.
I also had the peach mango bellini (their signature cocktail) which was quite delish. It's only $7 on Thursday for the Bellini's 

Overall: 
5 stars for service (fast, efficient and attentive)
4 for food quality 
4 for price"}
{"text":"Always a steady, good experience at Scaddabush Richmond Hill. You have to try their Mozzarella. We were about 10 people, and the service was spotty. They managed to mess up the order on a night when it wasn't too busy. Stuff happens. But it costs 1 star :)

Will go back again."}
{"text":"So good!! I ordered Smoked bacon and egg pizza and it was super tasty. The runny egg was messy,  but they use in house fresh mozzarella Was really SHOOKETH about how good this place is. Would totally come back ;)"}
{"text":"Why hello there mismatched chairs, dark hipster lighting, and many different kinds of tables. Scaddabush is in the plaza with the many different eateries on Beaver Creek. At peak times, parking can be a disaster, so make sure you come a little earlier to make your reservations. 

We ordered the naked mozzarella, the butcher pizza, and the pollo fettuccine (I think that's what it's called). I recommend the mozzarella as it was pleasantly delicious. Wasn't sure what I was expecting but it was very light and mild, and if you'd like to order an appy, it's a yummy choice! The pizza and pasta were good. It wasn't a mind blowing experience but it was made fresh. 

Scaddabush is a B+ in my book. Great place for date nights and big parties. Amazing atmosphere. Pretty good food as well. Recommended."}
{"text":"The rebrand and reimage of Alice Fazooli's - trying to make the restaurant cater more for the young and hip. The restaruant is in the same layout as the old Alice Fazooli's. The service was a bit slow, it took some time for the main to come out. The appetizer came out a lot faster. The stuffed meat ball was a little disppointing as it was just stuffed with more meat inside rather than some like cheese or something more exotic. The shrimp spaghetti was ok but I found the over of all the food was on the salty side, especially the meatball. 

The up side was the kids menu, the pasta option came with quite a bit of food and their chocolate Gelato wasn't  bad either. 

Average rating for not being too bad nor too spectacular. Could potentially go back to try again."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about this experience from the beginning.  I called on a Wednesday night to make a reservation for the Friday for 5 people at 6:00pm.  It took 12 mins to get through and placed on hold twice to make get reservations which I specified for a booth.

I got to the restaurant at the time and no booth for 5 people.  Instead they seated us to a table that would barely hold 4 people on old wooden school chairs.  I waited 5 minutes for the 3 hostesses to figure out what to do.  The solution was to take a 2 seater and combine them (not sure if my math is correct but 2 seater + 2 seater = 4 not 5).  Keep in mind they did had space to accommodate.  Honestly this was for a special occasion easy and th bill would have been $300 to $400.  

Instead we picked up and went across the parking lot to Moxies which was more then accommodating and take the business.

This would have been my second time coming to this location.  The first time I came the waiter was snoby and erogant everybody can have a bad day, but it was clear that the management encurages or doesn't care about service."}
{"text":"Everything about last night's dining experience was wonderful. The service was timely and personal without being pushy. The server suggested the Girls Night Out Appie and Sangria Special and was happy to split it 5 ways instead of 4. The fried zucchini was the best I ever had. My steak and polenta entree was divine. The atmosphere was festive and relaxed; it was the perfect way to end a busy teaching day."}
{"text":"Muy buen servicio, el lugar muy lindo, la comida deliciosa aunque con poca sal, pedimos porción regular y aún así fue abundante."}
{"text":"This Scaddabush location is a lot closer to me than the one located downtown, so to celebrate my birthday this year, this was the location we unanimously chose. 

The food here is passable. Wasn't really anything to write home about. There is obviously way better Italian elsewhere. The food to me felt like what you'd expect from a chain restaurant. East side Mario food on fancy plates really. 

The service was also a pass for me, but barely. Our server was great, very attentive and kept coming back to check on us (20 person party). She suggested the best drinks, meals and comped some drinks + dessert for the table which was great and appreciated. We didn't ask, so it was nice that she went out of her way to do that. 

Where the service fell flat though was when we arrived. I called days ahead to book several tables as walking in with 20 people would take forever to get seated. Upon arrival I was shown to the back near the windows. 4 tables with approx 10 chairs. I told the hostess, was a guy, that I booked for 20. His response was \"ya, once this area clears we'll pull up some chairs\". Ughhhh, okay.. I guess half my party will stand for an hour? Why take a party of 20 and seat us if you don't even have the space? How stupid is that .. Let's just say we never saw him again for the rest of the night. We had to ask patrons to borrow chairs and steal empty tables before they were cleaned. 

We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Dined with sister. 
Highlights: 
Nice decor, seated us quickly for an 8 pm reservation, restaurant busy but not crowded. Appetizers: the Naked: amazing! We shared the first mozzarella appetizer on the menu (the naked) & asked for extra basil- which we love and it was delicious. The flavours were rich and nicely balanced. Salad- shared a large mixed green salad. Overall - nice but underwhelming. Lots of greens, 

Entrees: 
We each got a small plate. The portions were generous- and this amount was just right. 

-Lobster spaghetti: extremely delicious! Lots of ingredients (& enough lobster) resulting in lots of flavour. Not dry. Surpassed expectations. Definitely recommend.

-Capri: exquisite. If you like seafood, you'll love this! Squid, scallops, shrimp, mussels, and fresh fettuccine with a tomato sauce. Fresh, rich, complex flavours. 

Dessert and cappuccinos: chocolate toffee jar cake. We asked for walnuts on the side (this was done). See lowlights

Lowlights: had to remind waitress to bring us fresh basil with our appetizer. Salad needed more dressing (too light- could barely taste it). 

After (sigh) a fantastic meal, we felt let down at dessert time. Their timing was off- our cappuccinos were brought out way before our dessert even though we asked for them together- so by the time the dessert came we had already finished our coffee. We waited so long for our dessert that we thought they forgot we ordered dessert. When we mentioned this to a waitress, we got a lame ' oh- sorry'. Cappuccinos were not hot. We would have appreciated an offer of fresh cappuccinos for when our dessert did arrive.

The actual dessert was a let down. First of all, it did not have vanilla whipped cream as per the description. The cake was dry- not enough ganache mixed throughout. Could have used more toffee. 

Service- friendly, and overall fine, but not stellar. We had asked for the cheque to be split at the beginning of the meal, but this wasn't done and the waitress said 'I hope one bill is ok- I can still split the amount'. But we needed two bills, so she had to redo it. We then waited an extraordinarily long time for her to return (15 min). She was nice, but voiced her complaint with the extra work involved. Ambience- we needed candles to read our menu (the restaurant was so dark in the corner) and the very loud music made it feel as if we were in a bar instead of a restaurant. It was difficult to carry out a conversation without shouting.

Overall- I would recommend coming here for the delicious appetizers and entrees. Everything else you need to be aware of so you know what to expect. Advice to restaurant- improve the dessert and service through to the end (finish strong) and your guests will be truly wowed."}
{"text":"After the demise of Alice Fazooli's (I think the whole chain), out comes Scaddabush to fill the pseudo-Italian bar/eatery.
It's an A-OK replacement for a Just OK place.
The fresh moz is quite nice and the cut your own pizza is quite good.
I wouldn't go here for Pizza only, I wouldn't go here for Pasta only, nor would I want to hang out here for a Bar experience.  However, if you are looking for an A-OK place to meet, enjoy a BEvERage (yeah I know you saw what I did there) and decent food...Scaddabush fits the bill.  Oh, the bill won't put you back too much either.  Mangia...Mangia.

Cheers."}
{"text":"came here for an anniversary dinner and was left pretty happy over the experience. 
you cant go wrong with Scaddabush's in my humble opinion. this location was great, but had a couple of hiccups, we came on a Saturday for dinner, no reservation and we had to wait about 20 minutes which was ok, not terrible. we got in and sat down at one of the back sections with bar style seating, not my favorite style but that's ok. our server was a bit all over the place, she took the order for the food, and had to come back to clarify a couple of things on the menu. our apps came flawlessly without any problem or hassle what so ever. our mains showed up and the main they attempted to serve me had a giant beef meatball in the centre, when I asked if it was beef, she responded with yes, and I informed her that I am allergic to it. she promptly vacated the meal from the table immediately. she came back to explain that the kitchen had mistakenly entered the wrong item in but that they would cook it right away. within about 3 minutes I had a hot and steaming bowl of pasta with sauce. everything else was great about the meal and the experience of coming by, just wasn't happy about the checking in and the wrong meal coming to the table. 
parking is available with multiple above and below lots, transit options is union station and walking or st. Andrew and walking. alternatively this restaurant is reachable via the Toronto underground path. 
would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This location used to be an Alice Fazooli but now it's owned and operated by Scaddabush.  Only change is the menu. We were in the bar area and great drink menu.  We shared some appetizers, bruschetta, fried zucchini, giant meatball and fresh pulled mozzarella.  Good atmosphere and good appetizer menu selections."}
{"text":"So if you don't care for beets or goats cheese you should get the beet and goat cheese salad. it's mostly spinach with onions. 

Rating : Really a 2.5 but I felt 3 was too much. 

Location:

In the part of Richmond hill at the 404 and highway 7 where all the western restaurants are. 

Parking: 
Huge parking lot but there are a tonne of restaurants so... If you come off hours you can find something close. Otherwise, good luck, may the force be with you. Bring some walking shoes.

Decor
It's the old Alice fazoolis. They renovated it.so now it's 'rustic'. 

Seating is made up of low tables and chairs, high tables with higher chairs and booths. There's also a bar area but all the times I've visited I've never sat there.

Music is so loud you sometimes can't hear the person sitting across from you.

Service:
Wait staff are always nice. Just not around a lot. This last time we didn't get any water and spent a lot of time looking for out waiter to get the dessert menu, the bill, and  then to pay for the bill. There was a good 20 minutes where we couldn't even see him. 
Note: as were were leaving we discovered where the servers were. Drinking at the bar. The guy who was bringing out food was doing a shot. 

Food:
Meh. 
I'm not sure what the big fuss is about. Ive never been overly impressed but this last time was the worse.

 Beet and goat cheese salad. There were more walnuts than cheese. The over all flavour?  Raw onions. There were more raw onions than beets. The dressing was incredibly sour. Almost inedible. At least they got rid of the awful pears they had in the summer

Charity bread- not a lot of butter. It was pre cut for some reason. The sides, including those in the middle, had that hard crust the bread gets when it's been sitting g out a few hours. Super. 

Zappolis- super eggy. Not pleasant. The dipping sauce was fantastic but they were pretty cheap with it. Two tablespoons for all those balls? God, can you at least put enough for the whole dessert.

Conclusion. I'm tired of coming for meh food. It's too expensive for that."}
{"text":"I came here on Friday night for dinner with my boyfriend. I had heard of the downtown location and have wanted to try it for a while, so I was thrilled to find out there was one that just opened in Richmond Hill. I really loved Alice Fazoolis but I think it's a great change.

The interior looks basically the same and I've always loved the look of the place.

Our server was extremely kind, friendly and helpful. We decided to start off with some drinks and she made some recommendations for apps. My boyfriend was really excited to see that they made cheese in house to order so he got an order of the mozzarella cheese and I warned him that he was on his own for that one. We also got the polenta tots. I've only been introduced to polenta recently and really like it and these were superb. The sauce was really good and they gave the perfect amount.

For our mains I got the lobster spaghetti and he got the egg and bacon pizza. We kind of both shared our meals. I ordered the larger size pasta because my man's a big guy and kind of wished I ordered the smaller one because we didn't exactly finish it but whatever. Nonetheless both meals were amazing and great portions. The pizza is a little spicy for my liking but I'm also a big baby when it comes to spiciness.

Overall it was a great experience. Attentive and quick service and delicious food with large portions. Can't go wrong!

I would definitely return. Probably downtown because I like to get out of Richmond Hill as often as I can!"}
{"text":"Giving this place a 3 star rating seeing that the prices are a bit high for their food. Especially the fresh mozzarella although it's made in-house, it's almost $20 for the fancy ball of cheese. WHAT WAS GROSS THOUGH was that I found a piece of hair INSIDE the bread???? We immediately told our server and they offered a free appetizer plus took the first order off the bill. In other news, their pizza and pasta are pretty good and unique like that special spicy bee pizza and zucca ravioli. I would come back some other time to try out their pesto pollo. The server that we had was very attentive to our table as well. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and when she realized we had more dip than bread she quickly asked us if we wanted more (which was yes, obviously!)"}
{"text":"Went here for a group dinner and other than slow service it was a good experience.  Enjoyed the polenta tots we shared.  The group raves about the seafood pasta.  Nice warm atmosphere on a cold Toronto night. Would return."}
