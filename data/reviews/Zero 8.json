{"text":"This is a great gluten-free, nut free restaurant.  Everything from the food, drinks and even the bathroom soap are allergen free.  My wife and I ate here four separate times during our 5 day stay in Montreal.  We loved it.  I would recommend the braised beef and the poutine style fries!

C'est parfait!"}
{"text":"It's great to be able to order anything from a menu, so big plus for that. The service is slow and forgetful, but very friendly. Main courses are average, though mashed potatoes are realllllly good. Desserts are awesome! Wine selection is good, too. Acoustics in the restaurant are not great -- it can be too loud to hear the person across from you at your table if there's a party. Expensive for the ambiance."}
{"text":"I'm completely gluten free and went to Zero8 with my husband because I wanted a meal without having to think too hard. The meal was really great and solid service.  I had the duck poutine (cheeseless) and it was really good."}
{"text":"I have to admit, with a name like Zero8, I was doubtful at first, but I really enjoyed my visit! It's an impeccable place to go if you're struggling with allergies or are on a strict diet. Most places I've been that care about allergies tend to cut meat out altogether, but having allergies doesn't mean meat *has* to be cut. I had a wild game burger with freshly baked, gluten-free bread with a side of quinoa salad and salad. I know that's an awkward sounding combination, but it was my choice.  Anyway, I loved my meal and my girlfriend, who is adhering to a low FODMAP diet is raving about hers-telling all her friends who visit Montreal that this is the place to go if you want to skip caring about what ingredients are in every item on the menu for a change.

I am not a wine drinker, but I can say their selection was rather extensive, much larger than I expected anyway. Instead of a rum and coke or a sangria, I had one of their gluten-free beers by Nouvelle-France. The beer is admittedly not popular on BeerAdvocate, but I don't know of any gluten-free beers that are.

I finished off my meal with their chocolate cake and my girlfriend had the chocolate mousse. I think I preferred her mousse over the cake, but both were well-made desserts. I forgot to double-check whether the chocolate mousse was made with dark chocolate (for low FODMAP), but the cake definitely was, and it was delicious.

The vibe of the place was welcoming, quiet, and cozy. It was exactly the way I was looking to end my evening."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find! I had a cold ratatouille topped with micro-greens with slices of medium rare beef as an appetizer. My entree was the roast duck breast. It was accompanied by a wonderful rice and mushroom pilaf and a yellow summer squash purée. Great ambiance and friendly efficient service. A top rate experience all around!"}
{"text":"I came here for the MTL à table week with a friend. The place was pretty empty at the time, and perhaps because of this, contrary to recent reviews, we actually found the service to be just right. I had the parsnip pâté on arugula with mushrooms, the wild boar stew, and the apple crepe for dessert. I thoroughly liked the appetizer, which was intriguing - how was it cooked? What exactly was it? - and tasty. The stew and accompanying potatoes - again, what was holding them together if it wasn't a dairy product? - were likewise very good. The crepe was just fine. I especially liked my Glutenberg red ale, which I will probably be purchasing for general consumption in future despite not being gluten-intolerant myself. The major thing I would change about this restaurant experience would be to cut down on the Jack Johnson in the background - yawn!

All in all, this was a good meal and it's great that such a restaurant exists for all the celiacs, lactose intolerant people and allergy sufferers out there."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews for this place i think i worked my expectations up a little too high. First off the service was meh (like mark e. said in his review). Everything seemed to take forever. Plus the menu was in French so we have to use Google translate to select our food, which is fine i know i am just a tourist.

I ended up getting the roast beef sandwich for lunch. It was actually pretty good but the portion of the sandwich was small and didn't have enough beef to make me happy.  For a place they tries to be uber healthy, they really serve you a lot of fries. I would have preferred more sandwich personally.

I was soo excited to get curry ketchup with my fries, since it is hard to find back in the states. From the menu it said $2 for a sauce or 2 for $3. Some how we got charged for $9 for three sauces, when we only got 2. After waiting a really long time for our waiter to explain to him, he only brought us 2 of the 3 sauces we order, he took the extra one off of the bill, and proceeded to charge us full price for the last one. I wasn't very happy about that but i didn't want to wait another 10 minutes to save a dollar.

As a whole this place just felt pretentious to me. The food is good, but next time i got back to Montreal, i am not sure i would visit this place again."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: This restaurant is owned by old friends of mine. I live in another city so I was unable to visit until last week (it has been open for over a year). 

Zero8's primary feature is to offer an environment free of the 8 most common allergens (fish and seafood, peanuts, nuts, sesame seeds, milk, soya, eggs, and wheat and other sources of gluten). I am not allergic or intolerant to anything, but I gather that for people who are this is a really big relief, as it can be pretty difficult to eat out safely and comfortably when one has possibly life-threatening allergies. 

Many people think that allergen-free food must surely be bland, but frankly I was impressed with everything I have eaten at the restaurant. I had two meals there (dinner and lunch), and ate everything from carrot soup to lamb and a lovely pear dessert, while enjoying their broad selection of wines and cocktails. I thoroughly enjoyed every course, and I wouldn't have guessed that the food was prepared to serve particular dietary requirements. The only exception to this is the chocolate cake, which was lovely but just not what I expected, texture-wise, due to the different kind of flour one has to bake with to avoid gluten. 

Due to my bias, I cannot offer an independent appraisal of service. However from talking with my friends I can tell that they care *a lot* about good service and in particular about keeping the restaurant allergen-free. 

I will add that the decor is quite pleasant and thoughtful, with a really cool looking bar. Prices seemed average to me but I haven't eaten out in Montreal in a long time so I am not totally sure. 

I give five stars for the quality of the food, good looks of the space, and for the coolness of the zero-allergen concept."}
{"text":"My husband and severely food-allergic son visited Montreal last week... we don't generally get to eat out - too risky.  BUT THEN THERE'S ZERO 8 !!!!!  First place we've ever been where we could 100% relax and just enjoy.  The food was unique and delicious -- the place was pretty and very comfortable -- the staff (Valerie?) was so friendly and outgoing.  And then there's the fact that NONE of the top 8 allergens are in the whole joint.  It was my son's favorite part of the trip -- we are so glad and grateful, both.  Thank you -- thank you!  Please open some in the US! : )"}
{"text":"Un restaurant où je peux prendre absolument n'importe quoi sur la carte? Ya-hooo! 

En tant que personne coeliaque, j'étais plus qu'emballée d'aller essayer le Zéro8. Le resto est chaleureux, le décor est simple et on s'y sent bien. Mon highlight : le personnel, qui était vraiment sympathique. On prend le temps de nous parler de l'histoire du resto et du menu. En parlant de menu, il y en a pour tous les goûts : soupes, salades, viandes, burgers! Tout a l'air délicieux... et l'est! Et même si c'est un endroit qui se spécialise dans le \"sans allergènes\", on ne sent pas qu'il n'y a pas de gluten, pas de lactose, pas d'oeufs ou autre. Mon copain n'a pas d'allergies et a quand même grandement apprécié ses plats. 

J'ai hâte d'y retourner pour essayer davantage de trucs! Miam!"}
{"text":"I went here for a yelp hunger relief event and I was wondering why the restaurant was called Zero8. And so it's called Zero8 because their dishes do not have the 8 common allergens such as fish & seafood, soy, wheat, nuts/peanuts etc.  I thought that concept was quite interesting. I ordered a mushroom fusili and the pasta had a unique taste. (It might be  rice flour according to a fellow yelp buddy). Oh who can forget the 5$ rose wine by the glass. This place rocks! I'd love to go back and try their other dishes like the duck.  I recommend checking out this resto if you're in the St. Denis area and looking for something different."}
{"text":"a unique concept and nice to find food that I can eat that I don't have to worry about being cross-contaminated with gluten. The waitress was very friendly.
However, I thought the food was quite overpriced for what you got and in pretty small portions. It also wasn't the most flavorul. I got a poutine with duck bits instead of cheese and it was ok, but a little plain. As was the soup. I'd be willing to go back and try some other things on the menu but overall, I would say the food is just adequate."}
{"text":"Brought a friend there for his birthday after we both read reviews. We loved the decor and were welcomed quite well. The menu offered an interesting variety of choice. But the overall experience simply missed a little bit of finesse. The waiters had a \"pub\" quality, in the sense that my friend and I both felt they were not fitting with the decor or ambiance of the place. A little too layed-back / friendly. But still polite so it is not like a big deal. 

Then the food was ok in general. Actually it is the sauces in both dishes that had an akward taste. I had the pasta plate and my friend had a steak or some kind of red meat dish. The meat though was divine, from my friend's feedback.

I would give it another chance as like I said it was just a refining lack of this \"je ne sais quoi\"...

---

J'ai amené un ami à ce resto après que nous ayons tous deux lu des commentaires sur ce resto. Nous avons été bien accueillis et ils offrent une variété de choix incroyable. Mais c'est plus l,expérience générale qui manquait un peu de finesse. Disons que le serveurs semblaient sortir d'un pub et ne \"fittaient\" pas dans le décor. Un peu trop relaxe/amicaux, peut-être??? Mais quand même très polis.

Et la nourriture était correcte. Dans le fond, ce sont les sauces qui nous ont décus. J'ai pris le plat de pâte et mon ami, un plat à viande rouge. Selon lui cependant, la viande était exquise.

J'y retournerais pour lui donner une autre chance. Comme mentionné plus haut, c,est tout smplement un manque de ce \"je ne sais quoi\".."}
{"text":"While it's really nice to have a gluten free, allergen free resto on this strip I was sorta meh on the food. I'd love to see more vegetarian options on the menu, the mushroom pesto was in fact just a plain tomato sauce and wholly uneventful flavour-wise. Bright side, the space is clean and calm, seemed active with families who were palpably relieved to have somewhere to eat - serious allergies must make celebratory dining out a bummer. Our waitress didn't know how to manage things once 4 bigger tables were in play, but there's a lot of potential here so I wish them nothing but gluten-free goodness."}
{"text":"Not too bad for a gluten free restaurant. I played it safe and got the Steak Frites, which was cooked perfectly, their fries were really good. I couldn`t complain. Glutenburg beer was alright. My friend really did not like her chicken sandwich, I don`t blame her because it didn`t look right. There was some jelly or something on it - I don`t know. I`ll wait for her to put her review lol. 

The place itself is really nice and modern, the staff were great. I would not go back because their menu is not really my style, but if you dig the whole gluten free thing, then you might really enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"I got to know Zero 8 thanks to an awesome Yelp event, and have been back regularly ever since! My mom is gluten/lactose intolerant so she loves not having to worry about the menu in any way. Speaking of the menu, be warned it is pretty small, that is what you get for removing wheat, most fibers, nuts, fish etc.. The offerings are mostly meat served on rice, or burgers. They also have a duck-fries plate that looks divine, if totally rich. My lamb burger was excellent, and I would recommend ordering a side of salad and fries (these were really fresh and delicious). The bun is made with corn flour, which makes it thin and crispy. The downside was that the lamb meat was ground versus a steak, but what was I expecting?! 
The desserts tend to be on the heavier side with pudding and little chocolate muffins, the pot of cream is lovely though and made with rice and tapioca if I remember well..
You might find yourself waiting for a while (there is a lot of meat to be cooked!) but the ambiance is very laid-back, there is tv if you want to watch sports across the bar, and a jukebox..Next time I swing by, I might just try a gluten-free beer.."}
{"text":"Je reviendrais sans réfléchir a Zéro 8. Le nom est original, c'est que les 8 principaux allergènes y sont banni! Le mot banni semble cruel? Bah! C'est simplement qu'on a tous des amis cher a nous qu'on doit faire des pieds et des mains pour invité a manger chez soi Éviter des pièges complexe. La beauté c'est qu'aujourd'hui ça arrive souvent d'avoir 2-3 amis allergiques. C'est pratique d'avoir un endroit où tout ces considérations là sont prise pour soi. Je pense que c'est un endroit idéal pour un 5 a 7 ou justement on n'a pas a penser a qui est allergique puisque Tout le menu évite la totalité des 8 principaux allergène. Concept unique, menu style bistro avec des classiques de la cuisine française re-vampé pour plaire au palet des difficiles. Il y a même des désserts. 

Bon concept, belle cuisine, décor moderne et propre d'un bistro qui gagne à être connu. Bravo au chef qui a sur rendre ce qu'il y a 10-15 ans était médiocre. La cuisine moléculaire, l'accessibilité a des produits autrefois introuvable pour substitué des produits important dans une recette sont maintenant présents dans les restos."}
{"text":"This place was ok.  Service was meh.  Food was good, but the roast beef sandwich did not have much meat on it.  I got fries with the order instead of salad, and I must say there were a LOT of fries, I had to leave some and I rarely leave food.  If I had ordered salad and they gave me a huge salad that would have made me happier, but I went with the unhealthy fries option.

Oh, and sauces cost two dollars O_o, who has heard of that before, oh, you would like ketchup with your fries, 2 dollars, cha-ching.  I don't know, just never heard of charging for ketchup.  Maybe it is special gluten free ketchup.  

The menu is french only, but I broke out my Iphone with the google translator application and figured out what the roast beef sandwich was."}
{"text":"Jeudi 14 novembre 2013

J'avais découvert ce petit coin de bouffe santé sans les 8 intolérants, glutène et ses compatriotes, à l'occasion d'une premier rencontre avec quelques Élites de Yelp par un bel avant-midi de samedi. Un bon petit dîner mémorable tout en amitié à faire de nouvelles connaissances.

Malheureusement, aujourd'hui le resto transmet à tous ses abonnés(es) un petit mot, un dernier \"au revoir\" pour indiquer la fermeture de l'établissement. C'est donc avec chagrin que j'inscris ce petit billet pour saluer tout l'effort fourni par l'équipe de Zéro 8 à faire de la cuisine un endroit sécuritaire pour tous ceux et celles qui souffrent d'intolérances et d'allergies alimentaires diverses. Je souhaite long feu aux propriétaires en espérant qu'ils puissent se refaire racine à un emplacement plus abordable, sur le plan immobilier, car c'est effectivement devenu très grave pour l'économie du centre-ville de Montréal. Les loyers augmentent et les petits commerçants peinent à survivre.

C'est donc à la prochaine, j'espère ! :-)

Thursday november 14th 2013

I met some new friends and Elites, during my visit at that nice little place where 8 of the most problematic allergens are taken off the menu. It was a nice saturday morning-noon, all in good friendship and healthyness.

Unfortunately, today, the restaurant sent to all of it's readers and clients a last \"salutation\" indicating the closing of the establishment. It's with great sadness that I write this little review-post for thanking the good staff of Zero 8 making sure the food can be safe for everyone from bad allergies and inconfort regarding gluten and all it's \"contaminants\". I wish to the staff and the owners a good life and hope to hear from them again, maybe in a different part of land where the cost is lower for owning and commercializing a small part of land. Downtown Montreal is becoming more and more expensive due to land value and municipal evaluation.

It's, I hope, until we meet again ! :-)"}
{"text":"Came here with a group for an event. I was the last person to show up and they had all ordered already, but I was greeted at the door by the host and brought to my table and handed a menu. I sat with my group for 25 minutes and was completely ignored by the waitress and the host who decided that surfing on their laptop at the bar was more important: my order was not taken and I wasn't even offered a drink. The server had to be flagged twice and she seemed annoyed instead of apologetic.when she finally came to our table to take my order.

I ordered a pasta dish which arrived fast enough and  it was mediocre: tasted like canned ragu with flecks of basil. The bill arrived and still she remained unapologetic so for the first time in my life, I didn't even tip.

The concept of the place is cool and it's clean and nice looking on the inside, but the food is overpriced, the portions are small and the service seriously sucks."}
{"text":"If you have food allergies, this place is a MUST.  Just imagine: you can order ANYTHING you want off the menu!  This restaurant specializes in allergen free food (hypoallergenic cuisine).  They boast that their food and drinks are free of the top eight most common allergens: Wheat, Peanuts, Nuts, Fish & seafood, Sesame seeds, Milk, Eggs,and Soy.

It is a small restaurant and while we were there, there was a kid's party going on inside the restaurant so we opted for outdoor seating.  Drinks were delicious.  Ambiance was nice and cozy.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  Food was good.  The one complaint I have is that the food is a just a little too salty for me but I can easily overlook that.  The experience of being able to order anything off the menu without apprehension is THE selling point for me."}
