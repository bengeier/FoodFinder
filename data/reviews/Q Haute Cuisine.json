{"text":"We had our wedding at Q haute, the part owner Marcello was amazing to work with every step of the way, very accomodating. The food was delicious, the staff super friendly and helpful. Would recommend this as a wedding venue!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. I often leave expensive restaurants feeling like I could've prepared a much better meal myself but at Q Haute, the skill involved in their dishes are far beyond my abilities. The service is excellent and the location right off the river makes for a very romantic setting. They don't just offer a fantastic meal, they offer a dining experience. It's a must try."}
{"text":"Q Haute is beautiful restaurant in a great location.  They try WAY to hard to make the presentation interesting, which ends up compromising their serving size as well as the food quality in some cases.  Their interesting items were \"out there\".  If you're looking for a nice meal without all the awkward showcasing and snobbery, then this is not the place for you.  Excellent service though---wish the chefs didn't try so hard to be so unique."}
{"text":"I have been to Q Haute for lunch, dinner and mother's day brunch and I have never been disappointed.  The food is great, the presentation superb and they definitely get 5 stars for creativity. The waiters are very attentive and they are very familiar with the menu - they are great at answering any questions you may have on the food and also the wines.  The location is perfect for a romantic dinner, right in the middle of Eau Claire overlooking the Bow River.  In occasion you may be able to get a tour of the kitchen and ask questions to the kitchen staff. That was one of the highlights of the night for me, as I got to see all the love and work that goes into making these wonderful dishes."}
{"text":"Q Haute... I wish I could eat here every day for lunch. A lot of options, and for $15 that includes a salad and main, I'm happy. The food is delicious, seasonal, and just the right amount. The servings do look small, but the quality is outstanding and you will be full when you leave. I've enjoyed everything I've eaten here and the service has always been spot on."}
{"text":"My husband and I would like to thank Marcello and the entire staff for making our wedding day so special. The service was over the top and food was exceptional! All of our guests have made a point of letting us know how impressed they were with the venue. I would highly recommend Q Haute as a wedding venue...especially if it's a same sex wedding."}
{"text":"Q Haute is a wonderful place for a special meal. The food is presented beautifully and the service is remarkable. We had the 4 course Chef's tasting menu but including the palate cleansers and small bites there were 7 courses. Each course was very unique and a surprise. Be prepared to spend a good 2.5-3 hours here. It didn't feel that long because there were many courses so the time went by really quickly.   The meal started off with a olive oil and port gelato with ground walnut. It was delicious and refreshing to have something sweet for the first course. Following this there were many carefully crafted, delicate and creative courses. They offered us a tour of the kitchen before we were served dessert.  I thoroughly enjoyed the tour of the kitchen, it was an enjoyable experience and made me appreciate the food even more. They had some high tech gadgets and a chef even explained and prepared a pre-dessert on the anti-griddle. The desserts were delicious and a great way to finish off the meal."}
{"text":"I was recently treated to dinner at Q Haute Cuisine.  As it was a generous gift I did not see a menu or price, so my review is exclusive of price (though I would imagine the price would be quite high).  My group was seated in a small private dining room, with a table that sat about twelve.  We had two servers who seemed to be devoted exclusively to our group- they brought in a variety of appetizers as we arrived and mingled (including a smoked salmon wrap and fried risotto balls), and made sure our wine glasses never ran dry.  Our servers were fluent in both English and French.  Prior to the meal we were asked if we had any dietary restrictions, although I got the impression they would have appreciated being informed of these restrictions a day or two in advance (which is totally reasonable- I apologize).  I was then served a multi-course vegetarian tasting menu, starting with an amuse-bouche, then a winter vegetable soup, followed by a vegetable terrine, then a dish described as gnocchi but that were actually more like ravioli, ending with a cheesecake dessert.  Every course was absolutely delicious, perfectly portioned and garnished wonderfully (obviously my descriptions leave out most of the \"juicy details\"!).  The meat eaters in our group seemed impressed with dishes including proteins as varied as lobster-infused creme fraiche, filet mignon and quail eggs.    I definitely recommend Q Haute Cuisine to anyone who can afford an evening of very fine dining!"}
{"text":"My friend has been wanting to bring me here for a while now....but I bought tickets for a winery estate dinner and made plans to go with hubby. Imagine my surprise when I opened the front door and my friend was there waiting for her hubby! Great minds think alike I guess. The food, was amazing...visually appealing and also delicious to eat. We had amazing service from our server, who also doubled as the tea sommelier. And in the end, a kitchen tour :) If you are looking for a place to take someone special, you can sit at the Chef's table in the kitchen during service...highly recommended! From start to finish we enjoyed our visit and plan to go again."}
{"text":"My friend and I went for a Calgary Big Taste dinner at Q and were underwhelmed. The interior, while nice for the most part, had a tacky try too hard feel, which immediately had us wondering if we were going to be disappointed with our food.   The first course lacked texture and was a slightly mushy plate of pickled assortments but the second course was great. They brought out a mushroom risotto with Parmesan crisp that was creamy, balanced and left us wanting more.   Overall, the food was good but not worth paying what it normally would have cost (minus the risotto). The staff were friendly but incredibly slow. The restaurant was trying to serve everyone the same courses at the same and as we had an early reservation there was an incredibly long wait between some of our courses. I'm not sure we would return again."}
{"text":"Went here for the Calgary Big Taste and did the $35 dinner menu 3-course meal. I was a little hesitant on how I would feel since a lot of fine-dining restaurants have the risk of not living up to the hype. But I have to say, I was more than impressed with Q Haute. The menu changes everyday but they ask you what you like/dislike and any allergies. It was supposed to be a 3-course but they give you a snack in the beginning to wake up your taste buds and then they gave us macarons along with the bill. It has great ambiance and the staff are very knowledgeable and friendly. Very romantic atmosphere if you are planning for a special date night. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is not just dinner, it is an experience. Every course is so well though out, every flavour balanced. Be prepared for a long meal, 7-10 courses has taken us 2.5-3.5 hours. It's expensive but well worth the money for the time and effort put into the food. Great for a special occasion."}
{"text":"A-MAZING. We went on Tuesday night and it was just us, made us feel a litter fancier. Definitely worth dressing up to the nines. Gorgeous interior, and polite knowledgeable staff.  The food is all about experience, and did not disappoint. I think we ended u having 8 or 9 courses. The portions re super super small, the main and the dessert was just right. I was stuffed by the end."}
{"text":"I have written two reviews explaining the exquisite dining experience; food; staff; and location. Not one of the reviews have posted after I wrote them - so - I am trying for the last time to share our anniversary dinner with your readers. One of the best places we have had the opportunity to enter. Great location. Unforgettable dinner, that we are still talking about after returning over a month ago from our vacation."}
{"text":"I have to say number one I knew this was gonna cost and it was gonna be fancy but Damn this was like a 5D food mind taste smell touch talk everything experience!!!! Holy mother of god I feel like I just went to the best experience/movie/escape room but am also full! It was a thrill from the moment we sat down. We didn't just get fed. We got information about what we were eating, and our servers also knew how to mess with our heads while we ate. (Like the rabbit in a bag smell? Wow. Still mind blown.)  tip? GET THE MYSTery. Get the pairing. Don't be shy about dietary restriction. They will accomodate and smile and make you foodgasm for 3 hours.  Oh my lord - I am so happy I have a place inn YYC that offers gourmet multiple course tasting - but now my bar is raised, I don't think anyone else will match this level of sensory stimulation. I can't say too much, I hate spoilers. Just eat and enjoy. Bring your AMEX. ;-)"}
{"text":"Excellent food, definitely reccomend this restaurant, especially for a special occassion."}
{"text":"Definitely a dinning experience!!! If you ever watch programs like Chefs Table on Netflix then you will probably enjoy and appreciate the culinary experience! The food is amazing, the presentation is unique, the wait staff are always super knowledgeable and friendly and the atmosphere is upscale yet relaxing!!!"}
{"text":"I've had the Seven Curse Chef's Experience, a four course, lunch, and  a Beer's of the World four course dinner. All visits were amazing. Every time my friends were impressed. Q Haute is an education is dining. It's a standout in Calgary."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! We held a corporate event at Q-Haute in one of the private dining rooms for a group of 40 people. We hold these events frequently but this was our first time hosting an event at this restaurant. The entire evening was exceptional! Such a beautiful ambiance, extremely friendly, attentive wait staff and the food and beverage was nothing short of amazing. There wasn't a guest in attendance that didn't comment on the exemplary service and food. Special thanks to Aaron, Mercedesz, Roui and Sid for providing the most attentive, friendly and professional service we've ever experienced. They were truly EXCEPTIONAL, anticipating our every need and going far above and beyond what we could have possibly imagined. A truly wonderful dining experience and an event that was absolute PERFECTION  thanks to the impeccable service, serene ambiance and exguisite cuisine. Highly recommend! Prepare to be wowed! Thanks for an amazing evening, we will be back!"}
{"text":"While I can appreciate unique and different types of foods... I entered Q Haute somewhat skeptical as these places you often leave hungrier after you eat........will say I left Q Haute a true fan and convert of this type of dining.  Portion sizes were a big factor why I was closed in my thinking but left this resturant feeling full......  Q Haute foods pack flavor, style and creativity in a bite size portion. Best way to explain the concept...... a 7 course meal of mystery that the chef prepares. Don't worry about asking for a menu it simply comes down to chefs choice.... less any dietary restrictions you may have. My favorite dish was the Wild MushroomRisotto, Fole Gras Butter, Gruyere. Every dish can be taken down in 1-2 bites with the exception of this one which looked like a bowl of soup and was served with a fork. The cheese is formed into a froth which makes it appear soupy and the mushroom flavor made the dish. Exceeded expectations!!!.  Also to add the resturant overlooks one of the well manicure city parks in Calgary and is decorated in gray, black and white decor.   Great experience and highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Holy crap! I said to my husband the other day, the more I travel, the more I'm realizing that Calgarians/Canadians are a$$holes when it comes to customer service, not Americans. Then we came here for dinner and my faith was restored.   We got a couple GCs for here, and figured why not have a date night and go out for dinner. We went the Friday of the long weekend, so we were able to take a nice stroll along the river, it was very peaceful.   For dinner we did the chef's tasting, I think that is how it is anyways. We started with the amuse bouche, which not going to lie as a little gross, but the point is to \"warm your mouth up\" so  it works. We had 3 fantastic dishes (goat cheese with orange, duck salami and Parmesan custard and mushroom risotto, they explained everything in great detail, made sure everything was gluten free and knew when to come around.   After we were done, they took us on a whole tour of the kitchen, got to meet the owners an they even did a dessert sampler for us, which had 4 little desserts. And then to end the evening, they gave us the flower from the table. It was an amazing dining experience and I can't wait to use out other GC."}
{"text":"Q Haute is my favorite restaurant in Calgary. Every dining experience I have had here has been nothing short of excellent (and I have dined here over 11 times for both dinner and lunch).  First off, Q Haute is in a beautiful part of the city, just south of the Elbow River, in the NW section of downtown Calgary. In the summer, the Elbow River area is blooming with beautiful flowers and the river is dazzling. In the winter, the area is a scene out of Narnia, with the river frozen over and the trees iced with snow. The well-appointed decor in Q Haute is contemporary in styling with white being a predominant color in the furnishings. Q Haute has at least three large, separate dining \"rooms\", suited for special events or a feeling of dining in an estate home.  The service staff are eager to please, pleasant, and passionate about their work. I have received a tour of the pristine, high-tech kitchen on a couple of occasions during which time I have received short lessons on the techniques employed by the cooking staff and am convinced that the team is a very skilled, talented bunch of cooks.  Order a la carte or a whole set of food from the tasting menu. You will not be disappointed. The food is imaginative but grounded, whimsical yet accessible by all types of the people of various culinary tastes. Every friend and corporate guest I have taken there have fully enjoyed dining at Q Haute.  I truly believe Q Haute is a gem in the city and is underrated. I am always looking for the next opportunity and next excuse to eat at Q Haute."}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday tonight and it was absolutely amazing. The food was remarkable and the staff were super friendly and knowable. Josh was an amazing waiter and the Riesling he recommended with our meal was perfect with every course. And thank you for giving us a tour of the kitchen it was fun to see everything."}
{"text":"Excellent ! The menu is imaginative.The food is superb. The service is awesome! Definitely one of the better places in town for a special night out. Really looking forward to my next evening there."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I came here for the 2-course $20 lunch. You can add dessert for an additional $5.00. I was surprised to see that we had multiple choices for the appetizer and main. Soup or two types of salad for the appy. Three choices for the main and two others with an upgrade of $15.00.  Our group was big enough to warrant a private dining room. Let's just say we were all wowed by the service, food, ambience and presentation.   I ordered the carrot veloute with chive creme fraiche and lamb with barley risotto. The food was lovely. The lamb dish was very rich - so be warned. The portions look small but it is quite dense and filling.  For lunch, I don't know anywhere else where you can get such a nice meal. At dinner, though the cost is higher, you can off-set the cost by attending one of their events, which is reasonably priced or get a gift certificate from Costco.  The crowning glory of the meal were the beautiful, fresh gerbras we received at the end. The last time I received a flower at a restaurant, I was five. Most definitely a memorable experience.  Great place for group dining."}
{"text":"I took my wife out for a fantastic fine meal. The prices are typical for the fine dining scene; $125 for a 7 course chief's tasting. Then add another $75 each for wine parings.   The atmosphere was great; upscale with nice tables overlooking the river and the Peace Bridge. Every course was unique and amazing; everything was prepared so nicely and tasted delicious. My favorite was the Wild Mushroom Risotto, and the Quail Breast. What I really liked was the service. I discreetly told the server I had $400 to spend that night, and to just surprise us with courses and wines. I told him no shell fish for me and anything goes but pickles for the wife, and bam! They made it all work. We got 7 half glasses of wine; something for every course, and they brought the bottles to our table each time so we could take pictures of the stuff I liked, and help our self to more if we liked a particular wine.  The dessert was by far the best thing I have ever had in my life. 7 different chocolates with each a different texture. I'd easily shell out $40 just to have that dessert again; wow was it good.  I really enjoyed it and I will be back, however not more than once a year as the prices are pretty steep. I don't think they were unreasonable for fine dining, but if I compare to Taste (near Hotel Arts) they are more down to earth semi-casual dining, and the dishes there were half the price and the same amazing delicious taste and unique experiences.   So anyway if you have $400 to spend on a great night out and you want upscale dining I highly recommend it here, if you want the same food but more casual check out Taste."}
{"text":"I'll always remember this fine dining establishment as the place where I had wild boar for the first and only time.  It was unique - firm, yet succulent.   It was delicious, and if I'm ever in Calgary again on business, I will try to go back.  It's a special occasion kind of place.  We had a 7 course meal (I think) that lasted 4 hours if I recall.   The wild boar was most memorable."}
{"text":"Went to try their Farm2Fork 5 course menu. Food was great, Servers knowledge about their menu was amazing. Very creative menu. Ambience and Front of house was not what I expected it to be. Their function rooms are nice though, the quick kitchen tour before dessert was served was fun to see. Forgot what they served me as I was totally dependent on my boyfriend whenever we go fine dining. Overall the food was great!"}
{"text":"WOW.  Best meal/experience I've ever had in my life. We ordered the NATURA chefs menu (didn't have a choice in the matter) with the wine pairings. We received an unending bombardment of delicious, amazing foods.  Unique cooking methods, flavours, textures, combined with amazing wines.  The server explained in detail each item, how to eat, and what to expect.  After the main courses, we were given a short tour of the kitchen, and a little treat in the kitchen.  This place blew me away.  I will definitely go back, although probably once a year, since I will need another job to pay for the meal :)"}
{"text":"This is the best place that I have been in Calgary. Exceptional quality for the price and ambience. Not only the food looks good, they taste good too!"}
{"text":"The food here is still Ahhh-mazing but the service was REALLY disappointing this last visit so I'm taking away a star for the 2 -3 star service.   Sorry Q Haute... I ... didn't... really... want ... to but I felt your glowing review was otherwise a lie after a weak front of house experience and that should be addressed.   Considering everyone in that room was paying $125+ service better be tip top.  Service like this would be fine in a family restaurant but it's a weak show in this class of dining especially considering the expected tip is more that you might pay for your whole meal in one of these types of restaurants.   Issues: 1.  We waited an uncomfortable amount of time before being offered water or addressed in anyway by the servers after being seated. 2.  We added relevant details to our open table reservation but not one of our servers read them.  No one knew I was vegetarian or mentioned our special occasion which we listed.  Last time they knew one of us was vegetarian and that it was our first trip (that's my Q haute comparison)  I ended up explaining I was ovo-lacto vegetarian over and over (the servers weren't communicating or passing it on).  Two didn't know was ovo-lacto vegetarian even meant.   Later I was brought a dish with eggs and asked if it was ok... seriously?  at this level of dining you should know before it walks out of the kitchen not a second before I take a bite.  3. They missed our bread and I discovered that bread was key to feeling satiated after a Q Haute dinner because we both left kinda hungry.  4. Wine knowledge was poor (not the Sommelier because he's great but in the servers).   I was told my Malbec was from a region that doesn't grow Malbec.  When I said \"Oh, didn't know it grew there\"  she went to look and discovered it was Argentinian which was very far off.  5.  We were given our kitchen tour with a group of 8+ people before the wrong course (it's suppose to be after main and before dessert... because they give you pre-dessert in the kitchen) so it was just awkward and there were just too many people in the kitchen for a tour.   Why do this if it's such an problem for the service staff?  It felt like an inconvenience not a joy like I imagine it was intended to be.   Also I'm glad to have had a tour before because they didn't explain techniques or what we were seeing well and it was a bit of a time waste. 6.  One of the servers had terrible B.O.  so it was difficult to have them lean over you explaining your dish when you could smell something not at all appetizing.    7.  Courses should be cleared before the next one comes out.   Our pickup pre-dessert from the tour ended up coming out when I still was eating savoury food....  nice try, I guess? 8. We ordered tea to end the meal (The Sommelier is the same from last time and he's great with his teas too).  Well our server left it steeping and walked away and just left it way too long.  To her credit she realized eventually and remade it for us but still it was inattention. 9.  We were probably here an hour too long and it was mostly due to service as I don't believe it was the kitchen.  The servers all seem to share tables and it left a lot of gaps and I would notice them repeating a walk around the room with water but that has just happened yet our dishes had been sitting in front of me for 10 minutes.   Last time,  we put the fork down and the dish was cleared which is maybe a bit more responsive than I expect but that's my comparison.  10.  The souvenir menu like we got last time so I can gush on yelp about what I ate and the cutting edge food techniques used to amaze my taste buds? Nope.  Can't remember and I was counting on my crib sheet to sound smart for you guys.  I saw another table with them though.... Forgotten again... fitting given it was the running theme of our night. 11. Another table stormed out a couple courses in because of the service so it really was an off night I guess.  I get that's a challenging situation but I think the staff could have also tried better to contain the 5 minutes of complaints from this couple so that it wasn't coming back into the dining room and effecting the ambiance for those trying to enjoy the evening.  Over all I still enjoyed my trip but I expected better as the bar had been set very high.   I would say the servers last time were world class professionals in hospitality and the servers this round were not new to serving but probably worked at Ricky's or something until recently.     I hope they pull it together before I go back."}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews I was excited to dine at Q.  The food was ok but not worth the cost.  Our waiter was great but the sommelier was cheesy and dressed like a pimp, who attempted to over charge us for three glasses of wine.  The restaurant was only 25% full on a Saturday night, definitely a sign of things to come.  $325.00 per couple way to much $$$$$$.  Location is great, but to bright in the restaurant to enjoy the view of the river.  Turn down the lights, hire a better sommelier and improve your food quality or close the doors."}
{"text":"This place is such a gem! Not only is this place adorable and chic, but the food is outstanding! You can't choose your menu as it is a degustation chef's menu; however they will work with allergies and to accommodate you.  The price itself is only $89 per person, which if you've been to any degustation restaurant you'd know it was a steal! It comes with 4/5 courses however they add more to make you feel like you're getting more for your money which is always nice. So in the end there were a total of 9 courses.  The service was amazing and you can tell the passion and love for the restaurant from the waiter. He was also so nice, he gave us a private tour of the kitchen and a little historical background of the restaurant.  I highly advise anyone who is considering this place to make a reservation and get excited to eat here!"}
{"text":"First, a word of warning:  This is a restaurant designed for foodies.  If you're looking for a slightly elevated chop house or a better-than-usual dining experience in Calgary, keep looking.  What you'll find:  Currently Q Haute Cuisine has a single pre fixe offering with an optional alcohol (mostly wine) and non-alcohol drink pairings.  They also have a wine list, though we were told that in the future they may 86 the wine list and just make the pairings part of the offering.  I say offering, versus menu, because no menu is provided (until after the meal) - what is being served that evening is a surprise.  And this is what makes it so much fun.  What makes QHC good:  Chef and co-owner Michele Aurigemma uses best available ingredients, artfully prepared and presented, and cooked with a deft hand.  His kitchen is well run and each course, along with the amuse-bouche and other single-bite additions, are thoughtfully prepared and well executed.  He has a strong sense of flavors, textures, and the art of presentation.  What makes QHC worthy of a visit:  The front  of the house is equal to the kitchen in the explanation of each dish, manner of service, and the history behind every item offered, be it the wine, teas, mixed drinks, or the concepts behind the meal.  The maître d', Josh, though young, reflects his classical butler training in how he treats each of his guests.  Your commitment:  This will not be a fast meal, plan on spending 2.5-3 hours for the short 4 course, and on weekends when they offer 7+ courses, plan on spending 4 hours.  Eating at QHC isn't a meal, it's an event.  Added bonus:  During the meal each of the tables is escorted through the kitchen to see how it works, and offered a small taste treat (ours was an alcohol infused lollipop prepared on an anti-griddle).  If you love restaurants, then this is a real treat.  In my opinion this is a restaurant that aims to be a Michelin rated, and should be.  If they can consistently prepare and serve food in the manner that we experienced, they are definitely worthy of a 1 star rating.  Josh told us the story of a woman who chanced upon QHC on a business trip and was so impressed she flew back with her husband from Texas just to have another meal there; and from my experience I can relate to that.  From my wife's and my perspective, we felt fortunate to have stumbled upon such a great gem.  Kudos to Michele, Josh,  and rest of the staff at QHC."}
{"text":"Q Haute Cuisine has been on my list of places to try since I first started going to The Big Taste. Well, lo and behold, I finally made it happen when I took a Friday off and made an early reservation. Bonus: they have free parking if you can snag a spot at the entrance. We arrived right at 11:30am and grabbed the last free stall. Score.  The inside is gorgeous; white, spacious (with many private rooms) and very French. The view must be one of the reasons people keep coming back for more. That and the beautiful relaxed ambiance.  Lunch express menu is pretty reasonable. Two course ($20.00) and three course (25.00) options.  - Foccacia bread - they come in bundles of three. Oks couldn't stop eating them; it was like crack. I think we had at least three baskets during our meal. - Caesar salad - the lettuce was shrivelled and dried up. Sous vide egg and park was a nice combo though. Wouldn't get it next time. - Cured pork belly - holyyyyyyy, ramen joints take note. This pork belly was unreal. Fatty, incredibly tender and juicy. The quinoa underneath was bomb. - Peach glee - this was delightfully unique. Very playful. Lots of textures came into play. YUM.  \"Surprise\" Big Taste lunch ($25.00) - I overheard one of the waiters telling another table there was some sort of quality issue with a supplier. I guess that's why they had to forgo their planned Big Taste menu. Too bad because the panzanella salad, chicken pot pie and raspberry parfait sounded delicious. - Quinoa salad - again, the lettuce was sadly wilted and tired. Quinoa was well executed and the mix of vegetables was tasty. Much better than the caesar. - Sous vide pork loin - pork loin is always tricky to do but the slices were moist and tender. The potato puree underneath was incredibly light and fluffy. - Carrot cake - not your typical carrot cake. It looks dense but it was the complete opposite. Really good. Desserts were top notch.  Happy to have finally tried Q Haute out. I would come back but probably for a special occasion. That or for their express lunch menu again!"}
{"text":"I finally got to check out Q Haute! I've been delaying my visit to this restaurant due to its associated price tag, but decided to give it a try during the Big Taste week as there is a set price (we went with 3 courses for $35).  When you go to Q Haute, you're paying not only for the high quality and innovative dishes that are being served to you but also the dining experience. The service and interaction with the staff at Q Haute was exceptional. I read from earlier reviews that you can expect to be there for 2.5-3 hours, and that was exactly what happened with our visit. It was a relaxing and comfortable setting, where the servers were not inclined to rush us out of there.  Prior to our meal, we were served an amuse bouche (yam and cranberry biscuit). While it was interesting, it didn't do much for me.  With a fancy restaurant, one would assume pretty dishes  that may or may not deliver in taste. However, I found that with the first course that we were served (beef cheek terrine, lemon grass veloute, mushroom, balsamic, mitzuna), it was not only beautifully presented but the combination of all the different parts of the plate were complimented each other quite nicely (as recommended by our server to combine all parts with each bite). I was quite surprised at this.  Next up was the main course of the night (and also my favourite dish): sous vide chicken stuffed duck breast. Whilst the meat inside was super tender, the skin on the outside was crispy. My only complaint was that it was too small :(   Before serving us our final course, an employee came up and offered us a tour of their kitchen. I loved the interactive and knowledge sharing aspect of this! The beginning of the tour started with a brief history of the restaurant (La Caille on the Bow) before it was reinvented to become Q Haute and its neighboring restaurant Oceana. Within the kitchen, they showed us their sous vide machine and as well a huge pot of reuseable sauce. It was a tamed kitchen in my opinion (where's the hustle and bustle?!?), mostly due to the fact that it was Big Taste week and their Big Taste menu was all that was being served.  For our final course, it was a very rich plate of chocolate mousse, which was offset with the help of the dulce de leuce ice cream.  Before we were set off to go, we were also given complimentary bee pollen dusted raspberry macarons. Unfortunately I was not a fan of these, it was too hard (aka not freshly made) and the flavour was not anything noteworthy.   Overall, I'm glad I got to try out Q Haute. This would be a restaurant that I would recommend if you wish to celebrate something, not a restaurant that you go casually just because. A fair warning for those planning to go during Big Taste, while the quality of the food is great, the portions are dainty so if you're starvin' marvin, you might have to make a pit stop elsewhere afterwards."}
{"text":"WOW this place is delicious. Came here with my colleague for lunch and we did the 2 course meal for $20 plus we added an express appetizer for $6 to share.  So I got: Carrot and cardamom veloute with chives crème fraiche Salmon tranche with quinoa ragout, spinach puree, mussels and braised purple cabbage.  to share we got the Potatoe Dauphine  The soup was good but it was somewhat lacking in flavorful. It would be great if its more flavourful. But you do taste the natural ingredients.  The salmon was a WOW. that is where it got me. The Salmon was moist and cooked right. You can taste the natural flavor to it. it goes well with the purple cabbage. There are two pieces stacked on top of each. Nice.  The place is very quiet. Probably because of the location. We came here Thursday lunch time and there were only 4 tables including us. Décor was very nice. Service was wonderful."}
{"text":"Bobo booked this for Mother's day brunch last year. We were a party of seven. Two of us wore hats. The buffet was beautiful, and the service was great, friendly and respectful. The food was so fantastic, there was not a single item that was not thoughtfully prepared. Creme brulee, roast beef, benedicts, fresh tasty unique salads. We don't often go out for meals with both sides of the family, as special meals are usually at someones house, but I think this will be a tradition we continue.  Something for everyone: exotic fresh fruit, cheese, dessert, there may have been an omelette/egg station but none of us went. I seem to recall the toast base of the Benedicts was too hard to cut through, but the rest was flawless."}
{"text":"It was good. Food was good.  Actually I was surprised to find this kind of restaurant in Calgary.... haha oops, did I say that aloud?!  Yes that's an unfair statement... I haven't tried very many restaurants in Calgary yet...   Would love to go back to try Chef's tasting menu."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great location, remarkable service... this restaurant is perfect for a special occasion. We have been to Q multiple times and are always blown away by the quality and presentation of the food. My fiancé and I are actually hosting our wedding at Q and they have been more than accommodating on many fronts. Would recommend Q to anyone for a special occasion or for a private party. Definitely worth the money and the experience! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Nothing to complain! Absolutely delicious! And the service was just excellent !! I have been here a few times, for lunch and for dinner and never disappointed! For lunch I had a salmon and it was perfectly cooked and seasoned ... just great! For dinner we had a fixed 5 course dinner on valentines and everything was perfect! I love this place and I would go there again and again! Recommended 100%!"}
{"text":"Definitely on the pricier side, but the food is delicious! The lunch here is also not bad - 3 course for 25 bucks is a great deal for the quality of food that you are getting. would come back again!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite in Calgary for fine dining! The service is amazing and the restaurant looks superb. It was a full experience as we got a tour of the restaurant and the kitchen. It was wonderful to hear about the history and cooking techniques. The menu is very creative and most of the food is very well done. I did not personally enjoy one or two of the courses though I guess this is expected in a diverse 6-7 course meal."}
{"text":"Giving it a 3 stars doesn't mean I didn't have a nice meal or a great time. The service was great and so was the food, but if you're still hungry after paying a king's ransom for your meal-not good.   Our appetizer was a frozen hummus popsicle on a stick that was small-just a bite-not even a mouthful, with a cracker with lobster mousse on it (the size of a cracker, not very much thicker), and a baby potato with aioli sauce-the potato also wasn't even a mouthful. And this foreshadowed the rest of the meal, all tasty morsels (literally morsels).  If you want to impress someone at how wasteful you can be with your money-this is the joint for you."}
{"text":"Everyone must come here to eat at least once or maybe 10 times in their life to be honest with you. It's a bit on the pricier side for some people but I think it's worth every dollar! I can't say enough of how professional and almost perfect the servers there are? Not to mention the food I get every time I go there is perfection. I love that they change their menu often and they are always so creative with each dish. These are the dishes that are impossible to replicate at home so spend your dollars here."}
{"text":"Just had the most amazing valentines dinner and it's not because it was Valentine's Day. The food first of all was impeccable and to reiterate the review before yes this restaurant is for foodies is it expensive but oh do they deliver. From the service to the food this was 5 stars and beyond we spend three hours there and it felt like the time flew by. We had a tour of the restaurant and saw the kitchen in its glory. We had such an amazing server, it made fine dinning a less stuffy affair. ALSO I was on a cleanse and could not have sugar or starches Which for any other restaurant would have been an ultimate failure but they prepared a special menu for me from beginning to end and I did not miss out on anything the chefs were masterful in their accommodations & pairings and inventive considering the restrictions. 5stars and plus"}
{"text":"My experience at Q Haute, to say the least, was ... weird.  An example of \"fine dining,\" the food that Q puts out is actually ... very good! Everything is well prepared, seasonal and tasty ... so much so, that it pains me to feel I should give this restaurant 2 stars ...  However, it is the system of ordering that is really quite cumbersome and makes this restaurant less than functional. So much so, in fact, that the servers REALLY just want you to choose the \"Chef's Tasting Menu,\" so they don't have to quibble with you or the chef about what you actually want.  So, what then, is the alternative to the Chef's menu? Well, you can do a 2 course meal for $57, a 3 course meal for $73 or (you guessed it!) a 4 course meal for $89, all chosen form sections marked \"First Course,\" \"Middle Course,\" \"Second Course (Entree),\" and \"Third Course.\"   Okay, simple enough.   \"But,\" the waiter says, \"when you choose the 2 course, you can make one selection from the 'First Course' and one from the 'Second Course.' If you choose the 3 course, you can select from the 'First Course' OR the 'Middle Course,' the 'Second Course' and 'Third Course.' BUT if you choose the 4 course, you can select one item from each ... but ultimately it's what you want!\"  Oh, okay. Well, we'll split a 4 course tasting so we can taste everything. \"Um, no sorry sir, you will have to do two 2 course meals.\"   Okaaay. But then we can't choose dessert from the Third Course?  \"No, if you want to have dessert, you will have to do one 2 course meal and one 3 course meal.\"   Uhhhh ... okay. Then we'll have two items from the First Course, one from the Middle Course, one from the Second Course and one from the Third Course. \"Ah, no sir, because each course meal MUST come with one item from the Second Course section so because you are doing a 2 course and a 3 course meal, you MUST select 2 entrees.\"  Confused??? YOU SHOULD BE!!!  This system of ordering seems to me to indicate an arrogant chef who can't abide with people who do not choose a progression of dishes. A chef who very likely just wants to show off by forcing people to taste a multitude of offerings.  Perhaps that is unfair, but from the wait staff's tense demeanour and near-embarrassment in walking you through the menu, it is clear that they are uncomfortable with the system of ordering. A system that is not helping the customer choose what they want and forcing the staff to make excuses and apologies.  And this is unfortunate because they are PROUD of the food that comes out! They wax poetic on all of the dishes, but they are handcuffed by the system put in place.  My final complaint is the pricing. When you break it down, if these items were priced \"a la carte\" (which is maybe why they are not!), these prices would likely be higher than a restaurant like the Ranche or the Living Room, which I consider to be some of the nicer places to eat in the city.  So the summation of my long-winded plea to Q is this: You have great food, you have a great location ... don't throw it away by being so rigid with dysfunctional set-up of your menu! Remember, the customer is ALWAYS right!"}
