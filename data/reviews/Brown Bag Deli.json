{"text":"Had to give it a star to post, if I could I would have given it none. Ouch!   The place looks appealing and they do a great job laying out all the items with updated sandwiches on the signage.   BUT the biggest thing they are missing are prices. Yes, they have them on some far menu on the back wall, but not on the signs that exist near the items.   Hey owner, imagine a customer wanting to buy lunch but has to ask what is this cost and that cost. Uncomfortable! And what if you got up to purchase, not really knowing the prices and did not have enough money! Even more uncomfortable. Hey, give a little more effort and post prices on the signage you already have near the items and that marker board! Duh!   I work near the establishment along with lots of other coworkers and would spend a lot of money there, but feel unwelcomed by this and I told that to my many hungry, money carrying coworkers too."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today. It is listed as their catering section but they also serve soup and sandwiches. Alot of Duqs probably know about this place already, but it is has not been listed on google maps or here on yelp.  I am guessing Barry, one of the catering managers, served me today. His picture is on the about us section of the website. Barry is a charmer, so getting your food is more fun than usuall.  I had the cranberry, walnut, chicken sandwich. It was delicious. The sandy was packed with meat, cranberries, and walnuts and was completely satisfying.    Barry charmed me into the into the mac and cheese. It is ok. I might be too full from the sandwich to give it a proper review.  All in all, it has earned a good 4 star for awesome service and a tasty sandwich."}
{"text":"I LOVE bbd, eating a wrap and soup as I type this out!  Everything is fresh and delicious and made with a smile.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu here.  I always get a wrap, sometimes a soup, sometimes a couple snacks, always an iced tea.  I've never had breakfast so I can't review that, but I'm sure it's a winner.  I like chatting with the people that work there and they're always very friendly.  It is a little pricey, but I guarantee you will be satisfied after eating and it won't leave you feeling like crap!"}
