{"text":"I had one of the most amazing meals of my life here. The tasting menu is incredible, the wine selections were fantastic, and even the cocktails were great. Our server was great, and getting to talk to the chef was very cool. But first and foremost, the food was phenomenal."}
{"text":"We had a horrible experience at this supposed first-rate restaurant. 
 
Last week we had tickets for a 7:30 play at the Distillery district, so had decided to book at Perigee for the pre-theatre dinner. We had left a voice message almost a week ahead, reserving for 6:00 pm and had a call back the next day to confirm it, \"See you Saturday at 6:00\". When we showed up 5:50, the maitre d' took our name and seated us at our table. We were given menus and water and then waited. At 6:15, the maitre finally d' returned and informed us that in fact they couldn't find our reservation, and that he needed the table, so we must leave. There was no apology, only \"we can't serve you\". (The restaurant was still 2/3 empty at that point.) (We were not noisy, rude, badly dressed, etc.!) Of course we were angry and insulted, and stalked out to find somewhere else to eat.
 
We definitely did not make a mistake with the booking -- Perigee did.  I have eaten in many hundreds of restaurants around the world, and have never had such an experience. One can make a mistake in a reservation, but to throw out a party after seating them and making them wait 25 minutes is beyond the pale!"}
{"text":"A cold cold night right after the holidays. I came in with high expectations given Perigee's reputation for food first quality. The chef has recently changed to Chris Brown but the rumor is the quality hasn't fallen off. The restaurant is located in the underrated distillery district. The seating is center around the kitchen which is one-way shaded allowing everyone a front row view of the kitchen. Interesting setup but unless you're really a fan of the cooking process (I enjoyed it) you might find it a bit obtrusive.

Now for the food. They have a $120 tasting menu which seemed to consist of highs and lows. Therefore, my dining companions decide to share a few dishes of choice. 

Starting with a fruits de mer, a small smattering of seafood, excellent texture, each piece was cooked just right and fresh. The much raved pork belly was disappointing, good but not great compared to similar attempts I tried before in Spain or NYC. A Japanese sea bass and terrine with quail egg was part delicious/ part miss.

The entrees lived up to expectations. A beautiful duck fois gras/ sausage and breast - perfect in many levels. A lamb which seemed impossibly non gamey and combined very well with an apple side. Also, a prime steak with sweetbread was executed well but not spectacular.

Dessert included a perfect candied apple souffle, soft, fluffy and the mixture of hot and cold with a delicious sorbet. Chocolate three ways also heavenly with a malted ice cream, dense almond cake and flaky tart. 

Overall, this place is definitely a splurge. Value is not what you're looking for here. But, if you're a serious foodie, you will appreciate the quality of the dishes. This is hard to find in Toronto and perhaps only available at this price whereas similar quality can be found in NYC/Vegas for a better value. I would definitely go again if I can put my wallet conscience aside (happens more often than not) or someone else is treating."}
