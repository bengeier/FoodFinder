{"text":"Food was alright, the service was HORRIBLE! Both of our orders came out incorrect after waiting extremely long because they don't write anything down when they take the orders. I asked for greens at the end she confirmed did you say grits? I said no greens please.. still ended up with grits. Boyfriends whole order came out wrong and when they brought him back the right order pretty sure they brought out my grits they took back 5 min before from my wrong order and gave them to him. Waitress came back and just set the plate down and walked off. No sorry about that, does it look right now, do you need anything else.. just straight nothing. Never came by our whole meal to check on us."}
{"text":"Always enjoy eating here. But than I had them cater my Wife's birthday party and now they have even more of my respect. Love this place, can't say enough about it. Just go, I placed a picture of the spread from wife's party and now my boys back in NC want to come and certify this spot. LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Arrived around 5pm one Wednesday evening. The place is not in a nice area of Phoenix, and it looked deserted, and I was going to leave, when I saw a Mercedes and Lexus pull up.  So I thought I'd give it a chance. The prices were somewhat reasonable, I got the Lo-Lo's for $11 (2 waffles, and 3 pieces of fried chicken). The food was tasty for what it was, but I only give it 3 *'s because its just so unhealthy.. kool-aid, waffles, syrup, and fried chicken! This is the kinda a place I may go once a year, but I just feel so guilty!  Not sure what the syrup was, but it certainly wasn't real maple syrup (I'd imagine it is some sugar based creation), and the waffles were dry. The chicken wasn't very moist, it was also a bit on the dry side."}
{"text":"Great food. They keep it simple here by not allowing for substitutions. You just pick a number on the menu that matches what you want. Pretty much anything you order is delicious. This used to be a little hole in the wall but they re-did it - expanding the space and making it more modern looking. If you love chicken and waffles and basically comfort food, then this is the spot. It's busy at lunch time.  Each time there has been a good experience."}
{"text":"This wasn't a word-of-mouth situation, I was simply surfing the net to find something similar to LA's Roscoe's chicken and waffles and found this tiny spot squeezed in downtown Phoenix. I wasn't expecting anything impressive, but Lolo's took me by surprise. I didn't care much about the presentation on the plates but the food was tasty, well-seasoned especially what I ordered the fried catfish with scrambled eggs/cheese, i'm not a cornbread person but it was offered on the plate and it was good. The atmosphere was great and the service there is on point, they were coming by the table making sure everything was ok. I went on Sunday early afternoon, so i'm not sure how it is on a Saturday. One thing for sure, you won't be disappointed. The price is also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, the art pieces on the walls, music is entertaining. I love coming back and it reminds me a little of Roscoe's in Los Angeles. Their chicken is nicely flavored, love their wings, I can eat 10 of those and still ask for more. Their portions are perfect for the price and service is great...no complaints. I've been there four times and never had a bad experience with them."}
{"text":"Ok, so I've been using Yelp for quite some time, and this is the first time I've been so disappointed I had to take the time to write a review. 

8.50$ for a Bacon Bloody Mary.. Vodca, tomato juice with a piece of bacon in it.

4$ for a side of home fries (that weren't even cooked all the way).

15$ for a 3 piece two waffles and 2 eggs... Over Medium eggs ordered, sunny up came out. Also chicken was extremely bland... Popeye's Chicken is better and cheaper.

3.50$ for a mason jar of cool aid. 

20$ for appetizer sampler.. Pickle chips sooo deep fried couldn't taste the pickles, and breading on fried green tomatoes was VERY bland.

15$ shrimp Mac and cheese.. So salty was barely edible and the shrimp was rubbery. 

Complained to waitress (when flagged her down, she didn't even check up on us for over 40 minutes) she provides us with 4 coupons for \"free cool aid\"... As long as minimum purchase and day and time restrictions are met with purchase and says \" best I can do\". We also mentioned that the food used to be so much better before the location was torn down and rebuilt to which she replied \"I don't know why so many people say that.. I think the chicken is good\"

My SO'S Purple sourous Rex (spelling?) was good.

All said and done over 80$ for 2 people for dinner. I expect a LOT better for that price. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with friends this last weekend.   Our waiter was either hung over or just inattentive.  They had the roll up door up and after several requests to close it because members of our group were cold, as were other guests, the management finally rolled the door down.  We also had to ask twice to turn down the music.  It was so loud I could not hear the person sitting next to me talk.   
Our order was mixed up, but eventually got it right.  Had to ask several times for coffee refills. 

this was not a typical visit, usually we get much better service.  We will go back and try again.

Food was good as always.  Staff needs a little more customer service training...and management needs to be aware of how cold the restaurant is with all the roll up windows and doors open and to keep the music at a level that is background music, we're not at a club, we're at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles, hot sauce, red beans and rice and a huge Iced tea. I cant eat like this all the time, but when I do, I'm going to Lo-Lo's. 

My friend took me there before a Suns game and wow, what a great way to start the evening. I had 3 pieces of chicken and 1 waffle. My friend doubled that and he added the LARGEST GLASS OF RED KOOLAID I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!! 

It was a classy move....good show ole bean... 

Anyways, check it out, its badass.."}
{"text":"Come on now ya'll, you want good homestyle southern food? Then you eat here. Everything has the taste of mother's love!! Good people, good times and the food just speaks fo itself!!!"}
{"text":"DAMN!!! This is great southern food. I only have eaten the southern type food here (chicken and waffles, southern sides and starters) so not review on the burgers and such. The chicken is spot on. What can I say. In the top 5. All the sides have been awesome. Collard greens, beans, INSANE mac and cheese!! All super. Fried green tomatoes are on the mark. If you are in the need for a southern fix that is down home and just like grandma's cooking, this is the place. Service is always great. Servers and staff are friendly and appear to always having fun with the customers. They have a great sense of colorful humor. 

Go here! NOW!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars that's what I would give. There is NO self service parking for this restaurant because it is all reserved for the hotel. They offer valet but I'm sorry I have kids and prefer to park myself. We had to park about 1/4 mile away, drag our starving 2 year old across the parking lot. When we got inside their were empty tables and booths but were told it was a 35 minute wait even though there was clearly seats. If you've dealt with a starving toddler you know that a long wait is not feasible. We had to trek clear back to our car still starving. The parking and service is NOT family friendly and we will not be back."}
{"text":"Do not bother and here is why.  I have worked in restaurants back in the day in the south and have won a few contests for recipes so i feel relatively qualified to give a review about this.

Here's what was good:  the service was good and wait staff friendly.  Portions were large.

Here's what was wrong:

1.  Chicken breast was over cooked (dry) and way under-seasoned. This being their main product, it should have been really good.  Big disappointment.

2.  Waffle was not at all crispy nor very warm (chicken was plenty hot though).

3.  Fried green tomatoes were tasty but the tomatoes were half ripe (pink).  You do not make fried green tomatoes with semi-ripe tomatoes.  They taste different and the texture of the tomato comes out mushy if not green.  

4.  Tea is a Southern soul food staple, however Phoenix water is crappy and the water there is not filtered.  You can definitely tell this in the tea. 

5.  Sort of expensive considering.

We also had cornbread and it was okay.  Nothing to write home about.

What i am saying here is this is an approximation of Southern soul food but it ain't the real deal.  It came off like a trendy chain restaurant getting by on average ingredients.

{"text":"We frequent this place often and it usually is exceptional except for today. I would usually give this spot 4 stars but today the food was not up to par and we had the worst customer service ever by management/owners (not sure) when it came to resolving the issue.  I say still try it because maybe you will have a better experience but they won't have to worry about me again."}
{"text":"Me and my family ate here and the service and the food was great! We loved the welcoming faces and we will defiantly will be back for more !! Thank you for the delicious food"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Chicken and Waffles!! If you haven't tried this place then you definitely need to. Don't forget to try the Red, Blue, or Purple drank."}
{"text":"I enjoyed it, I loved telling people I ate at LoLo's.  But it is Chicken, waffles, corn bread.  Not my favorites but a fun place to go!"}
{"text":"Again...I'm leaving beyond satisfied...I just love the expertise in this place. Our waiter, Jaqwan, was amazing....Aahhhhhhhhh...."}
{"text":"The food is good, perhaps great, but the service is so piss-poor, that I feel offended every single time that I dine there.  Yet, I still keep coming back for the good food.  If I try to place an order over the phone, no one EVER picks up the line.  When we go there to dine, there is always an unbelievable wait, and the apathy on the part of the staff is offensive.  Often, certain items that are on the menu simply aren't available.  I have a love-hate relationship with Lolo's.  All soul food restaurants in Phoenix suffer from this same lack of professionalism.  It's a disgrace to our race and impedes us from entering into the mainstream."}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly staff and the food was yummy. I like the vibe at the original Lo-Lo's but the staff here make it worth coming here instead. Did not have the same experience at the one downtown with the hostess. She was not the hostess with the mostess. Food great at both locations."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype about this place, other than its the only place in Phoenix with this type of food. I've been here with my family a couple of times when my father in law is craving the food, and I've always been disappointed. Chicken is nothing special, waffles are soggy, and the service is sub par."}
{"text":"Saw this place on the Food Network. It is just off central in Phoenix, it is a small quaint  old facility that has a charm of its own. We had the waffle and chicken, service was fast as was the delivery of the food. We were pleasantly surprised at how good  the chicken is
They have no parking lot or waiting room, you wait outside for a place to sit. For us it was just a few minutes. We enjoyed the experience, for us this it is what  casual dining was like before the arrival of the Chains.
Good experience"}
{"text":"Ok, so the idea of eating chicken and waffles never has appealed to me.  It just seemed wrong, like i was violating a law of some kind.  But my friend invited me to go to Lo-Lo's for lunch and I gave in.  Boy, was I wrong about how it would taste!  There is something about the flavors that just work great together.  If you have never tried it, I recommend it.  

We went to the Phoenix location, and it was very busy at lunch time, so get there early or you will probably have a wait.  The service was friendly, with lots of smiles, which made me feel at home.  I had chicken and waffles, corn bread, and mac-n-cheese.  The chicken can come with gravy, which makes it messy to eat, but mmmmmmm...get the gravy.  The corn bread is very good too.  

My only complaint is that the waffle was on the thin side, but was still a great flavor to add to the fried chicken.  They have a large menu of classic soul food items, so there is a lot to choose from.  I went there about three weeks ago, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about chicken and waffles since, so i know I will be going back soon, and will buy one of their t-shirts too."}
{"text":"Lo Lo's is my go to chicken fix.  Though the quality of the chicken varies (sometimes overcooked, sometimes perfect), the sides -- mac'n'cheese!  sweet tea! home fries! -- make this place a must visit.  Just beware that it gets very busy and there's no good place to wait for a table."}
{"text":"I must say that I am impressed with the food here. Since my move from the East Coast I have been searching for rather good soul food. The fried chicken here is moist, crunchy, flavorful, and all that real southern fried chicken is supposed to be. The Mac-n-cheese is a great pairing and the waffles here are delectable. 

The owner has been there each time that I have been, and he has always asked how things were, taking orders, seating people, etc. I love a hands on family owned business that has really yummy food.  

I have not been to the one in Scottsdale, because I am not a Scottsdale fan. I also have not had enough room in my stomach to try the red velvet cake. One day I will get to try the cake.

If you can avoid going here after church on Sunday than you may not wait in a very long line, like I always end up getting! But, nonetheless, I am impressed!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for dinner on a Saturday night, the wait was short and we were quickly tended to. However, we were moved to another section due to a huge party coming in. Our new server was awful-he only interacted with us once and that was to bring our food out. We then paid the bill and the cashier charged my card for another tables bill that amounted to $74 (our bill was only $30) and then took another 10 minutes to charge the correct bill. In total, I had about $105 withdrawn from my account that would take a couple of days to refund. Horrible service. I am very dissatisfied and probably won't be back due to the inconvenience."}
{"text":"45 min wait and there has been 10 tables open!!!  The staff just drag their feet to clean the tables or to seat anyone.. The 2 stars is for the food. To bad the service is terrible. Otherwise it would be 5. Shame."}
{"text":"Wonderful, deserves those great ratings.  Place was cute, staff was great, food was delish!! Great brunch experience in Phoenix"}
{"text":"I have been hearing about how great this restaurant is for years. During Comicon I had a chance to get over there for breakfast. It was absolutely fantastic. The waffles are out of this world and the Kool-Aid reminds me of being a kid again. I didn't try the fried chicken but will for sure next time. Everyone at our table loved it."}
{"text":"I am in love. The music is wonderful. The food is superb. The waitstaff is very friendly, knowledgable and prompt. The waiters make the drinks and she was spot on. Ravin took extremely good care of us tonight. I had a wonderful time bonding over food. The bathrooms are very clean and the decor is perfect for the mood that they create."}
{"text":"The food is so amazing-. We have been 5 times now. It is a true spluge(caloric)- Fried chicken really isnt as easy to make as people think and they have it down to a perfection. The collard greens are as authenic as you can get. I love the waffles as well as the thick syrup.  My kids are young and I still have to cut their food for them, so I want to request a boneless chicken breast, just so I can get  to my food sooner!  Actually I bet alot of people would like a piece of boneless chicken, not me I love the legs and thighs. There are lots of people who wont eat meat off the bone (Weirdo's). Anyhow try this gem."}
{"text":"I thought the idea of chicken and waffels was kind of werid, that's mainly why I wanted to go. But this place was awesome! There waffels are really good, they have a great flavor. The chicken is really good as well, I also had their cheese grits. I really recommend everything I had and think you should stop by if you get the chance."}
{"text":"I LOVE soul food and so when I was told about LoLo's, I had to try it. 

Well, it did not disappoint. It was packed when we got there on a weekday evening. It didn't take long though for us to get seated and our orders placed. They give a generous portion of chicken, waffle, and sides. The chicken and waffle were perfect. I tried their home fries and those were amazing! They also serve homemade lemonade and the service was speedy and friendly.

If I didn't live so far from this location, I would probably visit it more regularly. Definitely give this place a go if you are craving some fried goodness!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try fried chicken & waffles my entire life but being a city boy I have yet to taste it. I knew that I wouldn't want to waste my first bite on a mediocre place so I'd held out...until now....and boy am I glad I did. This place is phenomenal. I had no idea how to eat this, did I eat the chicken and the waffle together? Did I slather the chicken in the syrup? I asked for aide from the staff and they assisted me along \"No, put your chicken on this plate over here...\"

I ordered a waffle, a leg, a thigh, cornbread and gravy (the meal comes with all-you-can-drink Red Kool-Aid too). They also had mac & cheese, fried catfish and red velvet cake, all of which looked amazing... I need to come back for that.

The tastes all meld so well together, the sweet, the savory, the salty, it was perfect. The waffle was warm, soft and pillowy on the inside, with just the right crispness on the outside. The chicken was piping hot, not too greasy, perfectly fried and flavored wonderfully. One of my favorite combinations was the waffle, a little butter, some syrup and the gravy. The cornbread was good drizzled with a little honey. I must say, this was one fantastic lunch. I haven't been so satisfied after a meal aside from maybe a few Thanksgivings.

This is a very popular place and was extremely busy. They have quite a lot of staff and they were all friendly and helpful. While I ate my delicious grub, a group of Arizona Cardinal football players were dining there as well, you know it's good if those guys are eating it. If you're anywhere within 1500 miles of Lo-Lo's please make a trip to get some amazing chicken & waffles.

I have photos and a more in depth review on my personal blog."}
{"text":"I tried this place because I know a lot of people who have been here. The layout of the restaurant is kind of weird, it feels really out in the open and has a crowded feeling to it. The music is soul music which is unique, although it was a little loud but it drowned out all the voices. The service was quick though, so no complaints there. I ordered the typical chicken and waffles, and I also shared some biscuits and gravy. I honestly had high expectations of the food, but the chicken was just average, reminded me of KFC chicken. The waffles were my favorite though, they were pretty tasty. The biscuits and gravy were good, but I've had better. Overall I would come here again, most likely a different location, and probably get the waffles but not the chicken."}
{"text":"We visited Lo-Lo's today and it was amazing. We are from Los Angeles and would normally get our chicken and waffels from Roscoes. We went in with high expectations and Lo-lo' s was on point. Definitely won take that match. We ordered chicken wings and waffles which were delicious. My daughter ordered the oreo pancakes she said they were Amazing. They had kool-aid and it too was amazing.  The only bad thing was the catfish bignets they lacked flavor. Overall 4 stars would have been 5 if it weren't for those flavorless bignets"}
{"text":"The best friend chicken I have had in a long time.  The waffles are different, they have some type of spice mixture in them, not to my taste.  However the chicken is so good we will be going back.  Service was great, we had a lot of attention."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. It's nice to visit a place that cares about quality. The staff is quick with the service and not overwhelming with unnecessary questions about how the food is. They must know it's good."}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is the bomb and the kool-aid off da hook..."}
{"text":"What is not to like about this place? I can get amazing fried chicken, a huge, flavorful waffle with warm syrup and butter, and Kool-Aid in a Mason jar! How good can Kool-Aid be, you ask? Just come here and find out. It's the best you'll ever have. Not to mention the fact that their southern-style cooking is some of the best you'll find out here in Arizona too. I've eaten at Roscoe's House of Chicken in Waffles in LA, which was the place that got the whole chicken and waffle trend started, and I can tell you that LoLo's outdoes them on every level. The people that work here are awesome and make great recommendations to first-timers. I've been here three times since first trying it back in April and I plan to go back any chance I get."}
{"text":"I lived all of life in the south until last year.  Good fried chicken is hard to find in Arizona.  It was good here.  I did not care for the salmon croquettes and the fried catfish was good but not great.  Sweet cornbread - oh so wrong.  We waited about 20 minutes to be seated.  Service was average, prices slightly high for what was being served. $14.00 for a veggie plate is overpriced, IMO.  Will I go back, yes.  Do I feel the need to drive an hour and a half to go back real soon, no.  Oh, if you are looking for sweet tea - they have it.  I ordered mine half & half (half sweet and half unsweetened and it was plenty sweet."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to eating some made from scratch soul/southern food. Unfortunately there is no soul in LoLo\"s food. The fried chicken was so dry it was inedible and the next batch I was brought was maybe a hair better. The chicken on top of being dry was super bland and tasted like it is dipped in flour only and then deep fried. The fried green beans are frozen and the green beans with potatoes are straight from the can.A real restaurant uses fresh nothing frozen or canned even Village Inn uses fresh green beans. So if you want super dry and unseasoned food this is the place for you. I will say cornbread was very good and the staff very nice and apologetic. Sorry LoLo's but for me you are a no no."}
{"text":"I've been to many chicken and waffle spots but this one takes the cake! Whenever I'm in Phoenix, my sister knows where our first stop is! The workers at Lolo's are always so friendly and consistently make sure everything is amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow what a horrible experience. Me & my boyfriend had been planning on going to this place for months now and we finally were able to go for brunch! What a regret.

As the server brought back our drinks she said \"I have two questions for you. This isn't the question but are you guys dating?\" We stated yes. She then continued with \"If you guys continue dating is it important she gets along with your mother?\" Well my boyfriends mom unfortunately passed away a few years ago. So that was awkward. She then asked if it was important we have the same religion. 

Who asks such invasive questions to two people that are just coming to the restaurant to get some food!? We weren't trying to have a controversial debate.

Food was ok nothing special. We got chicken & waffles, and chorizo with eggs. Chicken was real dry and chorizo was bland. 

We won't be going back to Lo-Lo's for a while."}
{"text":"As a huge fan of chicken and waffles, I really wanted to like this place.

Service was slow and inattentive. Kitchen staff appeared to spend more time sitting around talking that cooking.

The waffles were soggy and unappetizing. They looked like they were pre-made and had been sitting under a warmer.

The syrup they gave me was fake. Really fake.

The chicken was the worst part. It was greasy, overcooked, and the furthest thing from friend chicken I've ever encountered.

According to the other reviewers, this location gives the brand a bad name. If I'm ever in Arizona or near another one, maybe I'll give it another shot."}
{"text":"Food coma!  Lo-Lo's is consistent and comfort food for the soul.  We got lucky and their wasn't much of a wait to get seated.

Don't knock Chicken and Waffles until you try it!  I was skeptical the first time I heard about it, but I went to the grand opening of the Scottsdale location and I've been a fan ever since.

Don't hold back...go for the Lo-Lo's 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles and take left overs home with you.  Be sure to try the sides...my favorite is the Fried Okra."}
{"text":"Loved the Food! Chicken was very tasty, waffles tasted delicious and Catfish was the best."}
{"text":"After living in the Valley for 32 years, we  decided to head South into town for dinner at LoLo's. Hoping against hope that the reviews would hold up...delightfully surprised to find that LoLo's lives up to it's  reputation!

Simply delish! My husband was so inpressed that he asked our waiter to give him his compliments. The chef then popped out to say thank you. 

We were in and out in 90 minutes, but, only because WE took OUR time.

We'll be back! Thank you~"}
{"text":"Wowzers! This place was amazing. I shared the chicken and waffels and I had to add some side dishes: mac-n-cheese, collard greens, and gravy. It was quite the soul food experience; everything was mmmmm mmmm tasty. I also treated myself to some of the kool-aide (ohh -yea) took me right back to my childhood. The service was great!  It was tough to find parking but once inside it was an inviting and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm vegetarian so I just had the waffles and eggs the first day we went... aside from the line and it taking 10 minutes to get our name on the list, the food was definitely worth the wait. A friend of mine and I were on a road trip, read the awesome reviews here and we were not disappointed! The next morning we CRAVED the waffles. We went back and filled our tummy's with more amazing noms. My friend that went with me recommends the chicken legs instead of the breasts though, she said the breasts were a little dry. Who knew this would actually go together?!?!?! We were amazed. AWESOME PLACE!! I'm driving threw there again in a few days and we are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Phoenix location only. As a person of color who has eaten in a variety of soul food restaurants over the past 35+ years, I feel right at home here. Maurice and his staff at the Phoenix location take excellent care of their customers and regulars. 

I always have the same thing: The lil' Amati; I have for years. The chicken is always juicy and the waffles are always hot. For add ons I will get the cornbread muffin and the mac n' cheese. 

My husband has tried a variety of dishes: the chicken sandwich, fried zucchini, the steak and egg breakfast, and the salads; he has also had some variation of the chicken and waffles. His favorite is the salad because the chicken is good and he isn't straying too far from his eating plan. 

I love the atmosphere and the food. 

I have read a few reviews from white people complaining about the service at the Phoenix location. I feel like I need to preface what I am about to write: I am not calling anyone a racist or a bigot. I am not one, either. Lolo's tries really hard to meet the needs of its (suddenly) diverse customer base. It will not always hit the mark. If you like the food but are leery about being treated differently because of your perceived ethnicity I have a suggestion: try their Gilbert or Scottsdale locations. Those locations are gentrified versions of this wonderful minority owned eating establishment. Perhaps gentrified is a harsh word. My caucasian husband who grew up on Chicago's south side says, \"White washed.\" Ok, that's harsh! However, the non-Phoenix locations are designed and run to appeal to the markets they serve as determined by their geographic location. It is likely people who don't feel comfortable eating on the south side will enjoy the food and the ambiance in Scottsdale or Gilbert. 

The food is uniform at all locations and it is still very delicious."}
{"text":"This review is for the Gilbert location only. My family and I have been loyal to the Lolo's brand for the past 3 years. We eagerly awaited the opening of the Gilbert location and finally made it down. What an utter disappointment. The wait staff was so rude and seemed to hate being there. Our server was polite, but not completely competent. Even Maurice didn't seem comfortable and relaxed here. As a person of color with an advanced degree, I enjoy eating in a variety of restaurants. However, minority owned and operated restaurants have my heart. Good food aside, that's why I love Lolo's; it reminds me of the soul food places I ate at back home in L.A. The Gilbert location is very gentrified and so Gilbert-washed with its
customers dressed like slobs (just like they do elsewhere in town) griping about the Gospel music, and its weird chicken art, there is nothing distinguishing Lolo's from any other restaurant on the block. I won't be back. I live near Florence and it's about 90 minutes each way to drive to their location on Central. That's where I will go to enjoy my chicken and waffles with customers who dress (YEAH we DRESS the f--- up!!!) to eat out and chill while watching Soul Train or listening to their sick DJ on Saturday night. 
As my poor white boy husband who grew up on Chicago's south side remarked, \"It's like they white washed it, if that makes sense.\""}
{"text":"Good food. Descent service. Pretty overpriced for what it is in my opinion. Left with a stomach ache. But the food was very tasty"}
{"text":"A definite must! The food was great and prices were too. Called ahead for a group and they treated us like VIPs. As a Mac & cheese expert, make sure to have theirs, DELICIOUS. Wonderful."}
{"text":"4 stars easy for the quality of food.  I give the downtown location 5 stars, but something about the Scottsdale location is lacking (although i'll be damned if i can put my finger on what, exactly).

But don't let that stop you.  If downtown is too far, this place is still well worth every penny you'll spend there.

The fried chicken is unlike anything I've ever eaten.  I was never a fried chicken fan until Lolo's.  Of course, perhaps that's because I grew up on KFC and Popeye's and a variety of other sub-standard chicken shacks.  Lolo's is addictive.  It is perfectly greasy and cooked perfectly with a crispy-crunchy outside and a deliciously moist and tender inside.  

The sides are fantastic, and I always hesitate on what to get.  The grits are great (but how do you *really* screw up grits).  Love the mac n cheese which reminds me of something homemade rather than Kraft MacNCheese (which is great, just nothing special).  The cornbread is nice and fluffy.  The french fries come with a seasoned salt that is like a drug.

And the waffles.  Dear lord, the waffles.  Buttery, cinnamon-y (although I think there's more than cinnamon to the unique flavor) and syrup-y.  It is honestly hard to find the words to express the quality of these waffles.

I've heard the desserts are legendary, but god save me I've never made it past the meal.  In fact I think I've only finished the KK's combo #1 a couple times, let alone want dessert afterwards.

Service has been a bit spotty at the Scottsdale location, although never terrible.  We've had a couple times where we waited quite a while, but service has always been pleasant and apologetic whenever we've had much of a wait for anything.  So if the service isn't fantastic, it's certainly good and friendly.  

Now I can't wait to go back.  But if you're downtown Phoenix...go to the original.  I'm not sure what it is...but everything is just a tiny bit better there."}
{"text":"This review is PURELY based on service. I typically try not to do entirely service oriented reviews but this last visit was unacceptable. 

To preface this, I have always been a huge fan, I bring visiting family, force it on co-workers, etc. My earlier 5 star review was even featured here on Yelp. I have been there easily once every other month for the last 3 years. I even pick up the chicken for camping trips (cold Lolo's chicken and beer is heavenly). 

My wife and I were at the one in Scottsdale on Sunday (managed to get a babysitter so we could hit brunch there sans-kids). We arrived at 9:20am so I was fully expecting a LONG wait. We actually got seated right away and ordered coffee and water. 

The server came back with the water and told us the coffee was brewing and took our order. After about 15minutes a different server stopped by and said our food wouldn't be too much longer. This was OK since I knew they would be busy and it would take awhile, no problem. I did ask if we could get the coffee we ordered. 

He said the coffee machine was broken and they were trying to fix it. I mentioned it really sucked having it break in the middle of their breakfast rush. He said it had actually broken they day before and that lots of people wanted coffee (crazy right?). At this moment I thought, that's odd, I thought it was brewing... oh well....

Well, not being one to complain, I worked in restaurants for years during college, but also not being one to enjoy waffles without coffee I opted to run across the parking lot and grab a couple coffees from Einstein bagels for the wife and I. 

I came back with the coffee and before I got to the door one of the servers popped out and said, \"Sorry, no outside food or drink\". He was very polite, but I said maybe this could be a special circumstance since their coffee machine had been broken since yesterday and we couldn't get any. He said no. I asked if we could just pour it into their mugs, he said no. I asked if we could switch to an outside table, he said no. 

I said I would like to speak to a manager and could he please go tell my wife to change our order to go since I couldn't go back inside. He went inside and came back and said the manager said no also. I was in shock. I could NOT believe this was their response. 

I went to the car to put the coffees down so I could text my wife and tell her to just leave the order and we would go somewhere else.  Unfortunately by that time she had paid and had the food. 

So, that's it Lolo's, I refuse to give you another dollar. That was unacceptable. And seriously? What kind of place doesn't have a backup plan for coffee on a Sunday morning? You couldn't send someone out to Target to pickup some cheap coffee makers for the morning? Or rent one from a catering company? Or worst case scenario just order a massive batch from Einsteins? 

Instead you opt to tell people they don't get coffee and won't and if they get their own somewhere else they have to leave?  

FAIL"}
{"text":"Well, after being browbeaten by everyone I know who has been there some friends and I finally decided to make the drive down town to try Lo Lo's.

Following everyone else's advice here on Yelp we got there 10mins before they opened last Sunday. We were the 5th group in line and by the time the doors opened there was a pretty good sized line. As soon as we sat down I got up to use the bathroom (morning coffee works fast!) and noticed that EVERY table was full. I mean every table (this is approximately 45 seconds after opening the doors). 

Now, I worked in the restaurant business for over 5 years and that would have been a NIGHTMARE at any of the places I worked at. I was intrigued to see how they would handle it. 

They used a \"shotgun\" approach to serving, we saw at least half a dozen servers throughout our entire meal asking and getting us what we needed. The service was not notably friendly, but it was fast and efficient and there was almost always a server within earshot if we needed something. I have no complaints here, but I am relatively easy to please on the service side (probably the 5 years doing it myself ;)
Anyway, on to the food, we all tried to order so that we could try all the \"famous\" items. So I ended up having some of each of the following: Chicken, Waffles, Grits, Cheese Eggs, and Fried Okra.
I am going start at the best and move down. One caveat before we begin, I am not at all a fried chicken fan, I eat it on occasion but have never been excited about it or sought it out. 

1.) The Chicken: It was absofreakinlutely amazing. I am talking breathtakingly good. I'm talking take a bite and then hold it out in front of you to look at it to make sure it is just a piece of fried chicken in your hand. It was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside and not at all greasy. I don't know what they put in the batter but it was awesome. I am starting to salivate right now actually. I did try it true southern style with syrup on it, which was good, but I stopped because I felt the syrup was detracting from the overall flavor. I am not going to attempt to describe the taste, you are just going to have to go and try it for yourself; I will never do it justice. By FAR the best fried chicken I have ever eaten. All of this impression was with going in there with REALLY high expectations, if that tells you something.

2.) The Waffles: Like I just mentioned, I went to Lo Lo's with really high expectations because of friends and Yelp reviews. I was not disappointed here either. They were very, very tasty, and even slightly exceeded my expectations. They are the best waffles I have ever had, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, smothered in butter and syrup YUM. I cleared my plate despite the physical pain of eating so much. I would go back here just for the waffles, but I have to admit, the margin by which the chicken exceeded my expectations was much larger.

3.) The Grits: They were very good; I probably won't get them next time, not because they were lacking but because they would take up valuable chicken and waffle space in my stomach. My only previous experience with grits was in the Army, and obviously, this was an entirely different species of grits.

4.) The Cheese Eggs: These were tasty, fluffy and cheesy, overall exceptional eggs. Mine got a little syrup and butter on them which actually were really good. I can't decide if I would forfeit more bits of chicken and waffles for them though =P

5.) The Fried Okra: Also very good, and a great appetizer. We had a native Texan with us who is a rabid okra fan and she said they were the best fried okra she had ever had. For me though, they will likely go the way of the grits next time.

For drinks we all got tea, mine was the only unsweet one (which was really good). The sweet tea fans in the group said it was the best sweat tea they have had in Arizona.

Overall we got our food fast, our drinks stayed full and the food was phenomenal and even better than were expecting (and we were expecting greatness). I will now be a regular customer and am going to start browbeating my friends that haven't tried it yet to go with me ;)

Lo Lo, I sincerely hope this restaurant has made you a wealthy man because it would be a crime if it hasn't."}
{"text":"This is by far some of the best food I've eaten, customer service is great.
Only down falls the wait time to be seated and served as well very small parking lot. If you have  the patience, and don't  mind walking a few blocks this is the place to go.
\"not crazy about the chairs\""}
{"text":"My husband was in the mood for chicken and waffles, so we stopped here while passing through Scottsdale. OMG..they have real iced tea and Kool-Aid! Yummm! 
Then I saw the menu. Fried green tomatoes? Fried okra? Fried chicken gizzards? Are you kidding me? So I tried all three items I just mentioned and had sweet tea and Kool-Aid too. It was sooooooo good. Just like in the south. Yes, if you want some good ole southern chicken (my husband got his chicken and waffles) go to Lolo's. Delish! oh and our waiter never stopped smiling and made sure we always had what we needed. Great Job!!!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I've been to Lo-Lo's and I will definitely come back.  The serve THE best waffles, the fried chicken was very flavorful, crispy and not greasy, YUM.
Also, I chuckled at first about the Kool Aid but let me tell you, I don't know how they make it but it was fantastic.  Go for the blue Kool Aid.  But besides the great food, the best thing about this restaurant is how friendly the entire staff was from the waitress to cook to the person busing the tables.  Outstanding service.  I came with my in-laws who are extremely difficult pain in the _ _ _ customers from the East Coast and the staff was so gracious the entire time.  Thank you everyone at Lo-Lo's.  We'll be back for sure, after the in-laws go home :)"}
{"text":"I flew into Phoenix for the day to attend a basketball game and only wanted to eat at one place. I checked out Lo Lo's online and knew this would be that place. I got there a few minutes after they closed and I was so disappointed. I spoke to Allison, told her I was only in town for the day and that my pregnant butt wanted a waffle lol! She said hold on let me see what I can do and five mins later she came back and allowed my friend and I to place an order to go. I was sooooo thankful and happy. It was worth it. She was extremely nice and my food was delicious. If I ever go back to Phoenix this is definitely a stop I will be making. Thank you Allison! You're awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo good!!  You can order anything on the menu and it will be outstanding.  The only thing that was terrible was that the food was so fresh and so hot that you cant immediately dig in and eat (I burnt my mouth on the chicken, lol).  It smelt soo good that I couldn't wait for it to cool down.  But I would rather have my food extremely fresh and hot!"}
{"text":"Walked in at 930 (they closed at 10). I know it was bad etiquette, but it was late and we were hungry. The staff was very polite and took our order. Food was great, and found a new place to eat at."}
{"text":"Love Lolos!!! Been here several times. I have a Georgia Peach cocktail and Bettys Boob. (Waffle and chicken breast)  i have also had the signature chicken sandwich (award winning) and the waffle sandwich which was delish. Cant go wrong here it seems with the menu, drinks and atmosphere. Hood dining at its finest as their motto says..."}
{"text":"A funky old house, I believe, converted to restaurant.  The waffles are amazing (and we eat real waffles at home all the time), the chicken was just as you would expect...wonderful.  A real treat!"}
{"text":"I been here a few times and it's one of my favorite places to dine when I'm craving chicken and waffles. It is a small place, but today I found out they are expanding which is great news.  

I usually order the Betty Boop, which is a large chicken breast and a waffle on the side . It is delicious and filling.  Today I decided to try something different and ordered  the chicken sandwich. It 's so big I couldn't finish it, but it was also very good.  It comes close to my favorite dish the Betty Boop.  I would also like to mention the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"I live a few blocks away from this place and always see a line stretching outside the door.  Curiousity naturally got the best of me, even though deep down inside, I knew that I should avoid it.  Southern cooking and vegetarianism typically don't make for a good match.  However, I can always find something on the menu and knew that an occasional vegetable does show up in Southern cooking.  So I checked it out with my omnivorous girlfriend (who ordered wings and fries).  I opted for a side of collard greens and candied yams.  We also had a side of mac n' cheese for her daughter.  I ordered a Kool Aid as well, which cost as much as 25 packets of Kool Aid in the store.  Way, way too much sugar.  Seriously, it tasted like a five-year old got his hands on the sugar jar when mixing it.  The collard greens were pretty tasty and the yams were decent too.  However, neither one of them blew me away by any means.  (I recognize that the chicken is the draw here, but still.)  My girlfried said the wings were good, but I've have seen her much more enthused about wings at other places.  The fries were pretty damn bad.  When the check arrived, I had a hard time believing that we were paying $35 for 1 meal, 3 sides, and 3 drinks -- all of which were slightly above mediocre. I left with a big weight in my stomach, which was partially caused by the heaviness of the passable food and partially caused by that fact that I knew I could have gotten three awesome meals at Noodles Ranch (Vietnamese restaurant about 3 doors down in the plaza) for about $15 less."}
{"text":"Since my original review the location has been renovated to accommodate more people and has been modernized. 

Although to me it has lost the charm that the smaller locale had, the food is the same great tasting chicken and waffles, grits, catfish, etc. and wait staff is nice and attentive."}
{"text":"This place consistently has the best waffles out of any restaurant that I've ever visited!!  Their chicken is also fanstastic, and you must try the smothered fries!  When I visit here once a month, I go all out, so I can't do it to often because I would never go here just to order a salad - although that's delicious too!  Fantastic food and even better establishment!"}
{"text":"Came on Father's Day so expected it to be busy and it most definitely was! I used the Yelp app to be added to the waiting list and I was notified upon arrival that they no longer use that feature so a heads up! It was just me and the wife so they go it right in! The wait wasn't long at all and the food was well worth the wait! The chicken was fired to perfection and the mac-cheese was amazing! I got the chicken and waffles and wifey got the shrimp and grits! The best thing was the Kool-Aid by far! Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"For as busy as they are, the food still comes out in a very decent time! Best chicken in the world!!!!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service. We waited 45 minutes for our food. The waitresses never even came back to explain the long wait.  No 2nd cup of coffee as requested.  We were lucky to get a 4th set of silverware since we had to ask 3 times. Waitress rested her elbows on our table while talking as though she was exhausted. People at table next to us were informed they were out of eggs after a 1/2 hour wait. The food was good once it finally came but how do you recover from waiting 45 minutes?????"}
{"text":"I met friends for lunch at Lolos scottsale location today.My first time there and what a great experience it was! I was hestitant as worried menu too heavy but delighted to find a huge & varied selection of food...we had fried green tomatoes & split shrimp & grits...delicious! Very good service and not a thing to say anything negative about. Very attentive pleasant server who i wish i remembered her name..manager came by to chat..very impressed & highly recommend!! Oh someone complained about parking but no issue at all! Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast with our wonderful server Carl!  Bacon Bloody Mary's, chicken, catfish, collards, okra!  Carl made it perfect"}
{"text":"The food was served like I was at a buffet. Each side had its own dish and not very much like I was at LoLo's house for dinner. 

The entrees were as expected, but the cost was more than the value. Had a $15 plate, maybe next time I will go for more ala carte.

Also the valet parking is free, but the location does hurt the expected dining experience.

Probably will go back, but with more realistic expectations."}
{"text":"Good chicken, kool aid, and atmosphere. But the bad parking and the horribly slow service almost ruin the whole experience"}
{"text":"Now this is some good souuuul fooood! Better than roscoe's in Los Angeles"}
{"text":"Being from Southern California we were looking for someplace to go we don't have at home. After reading about LoLo's we decided to give it a try.  So glad we did.  EVERYONE at this place was extremely friendly. From Victor the valet to Tony our server and even the manager who came to our table we were treated as though we were regulars. It was great to see such diversity in both the staff and customers. The food was phenomenal!!!! Except for my wife's I've never had better fried chicken. We had the fried green tomatoes and they were great too. I look forward to our next trip to Phoenix so I can try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"I was not disappointed at all! I had the Tre-Tre (2 drumsticks and a waffle) with a side of cheesy grits and cornbread. Everything was delicious! I will be coming back here from now on."}
{"text":"Finger lickin' good !!! New location is HUGE & has a bar. Just when I thought chicken & waffles was an awesome combo ...they added alcohol !  Came here after holidays with family and we ordered 2 KK specials and extra chicken on the side. Our drum sticks came out looking like turkey legs. Ha! Waitress said sometimes they're huge and sometimes regular size. So if it matters to you, ask in advance before ordering. And now they're offering free valet like the downtown location."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but the service is awful. It took us 2.5 hours to finish a simple breakfast mean and it is rather expensive. Our waitress was rude and not accommodating. I would stay away from this place."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong when you can get comfort food and Southern hospitality until midnight. Chicken, waffles, grits, greens, corn bread? Yes, please; all of the above plus some purple drink, too!

I'd avoid the early weekend mornings when the crows do their walk of shame."}
{"text":"Family recipes. Old school soul food. Just like down south - sweet sweet tea, great collards, sweet sweet yams.  Fried chicken like Gma made. Waffles like home. Good food"}
{"text":"Went here for years but after they expanded seems like they lost the customer service.
My husband and I were ignored, waiting out for with a dozen other people waiting to be called. Then was talked to rudely when we asked when we were Nwxt. They said they sat 3 people before us that we did answer...because we were outside. The was no standing room inside. Waited inside to make sure they weren't going to sit someone else  and was basically told we were in the way. Took a friend and son with us..we called as we walked out. 

BAd CUSTOMER SERVICE. WOULDN'T WASTE MY TIME THERE AGAIN
GO TO DOWN SOUTH INSTEAD!"}
{"text":"First time ever eating here. Being from the south I have high expectations on chicken and it was eh. Fries were on the soggy side. Was really looking forward to it but it was okay. Probably won't be back"}
{"text":"The waffles are some of the best I've ever had. I'm not much of a fried chicken kinda guy so I can't tell you if thats any good. 

Customer service could be friendlier. We saw our waitress when she took our order and when she brought our food. She never checked up on us to ask if we needed any refills or anything else.

Maybe the one in Scottsdale has better service."}
{"text":"We didn't eat lunch on the day we went to Lo-lo's for dinner so we were ravenous. The waffles were SO good. What do they put in those waffles!? The fried okra and collards were really tasty. We also had grits and chicken legs and chicken strips, fries and corn. Oh, and the fried catfish. And the smothered potatoes. Burp. It was really good!! The location is also convenient if you're in Scottsdale and it was big and not busy (we were there at 5:00 on a Tuesday so we were a little early)."}
{"text":"This is my wife's favorite Resturant.  I really like it, but she absolutely loves it!

There is no way that either of us could finish a meal at Lolo's, so we team up on one of these delicious meals. Chicken & Waffles with eggs and grits! What a feast!

I love the kool-aide! Go for the Grape, you will enjoy the ice cold \"mason jar\" ... It's huge AND you get free refills.

If the food is great (and it is) then the service is even greater... Seriously great attitudes flow is this wonderful eatery!"}
{"text":"Happy place! Who doesn't like fried Chechen and waffle.
I have been the downtown location many times. Make me so happy every first bite of Chechen,
Chechen is well seasoned and cooked perfect, Waffle is very moist but nice texture on outsaide.

Unfortunately this new location need to learn a lot.
My thigh and drumstick was over cooked and dry. Waffle has nice texture and taste wonderful.
Serving was very slow. that I most concern.
Over all pretty good food. Wonderful  new addition to Scottsdale"}
{"text":"I went to the one in Scottsdale and ordered the chicken tenders with a waffle and some corn bread. Holy poop, was it delicious! The waffle is the only waffle I've ever had that wasn't bettered by putting butter on and the chicken fingers were the best me and my boyfriend had ever had! They were fried to perfection! The corn bread was perfect as well! 

There was only one place where Lo-Lo's could have messed up but they didn't. I ordered a waffle with my chicken tenders but they gave me fries instead. With no hassle at all they told the kitchen to make me a waffle and the General Manager told the waitress to let me keep the fries.

Btw, if anyone wants a great example of how a GM should be, go eat at Lo-Lo's. The GM was so friendly, seemed to work well with his staff, treated his customers well and with respect and was just above and beyond the GM's you see in many stores!"}
{"text":"Their cat fish and fried chicken was flavorful and tasty.
But my tiny bowl of collard green had enough salt for a dozen of Margarita at least. 
I was not able to taste anything after a bit of collard green and was too full to eat anything else after drinking a bunch water. 

Service was friendly though.

Will go back again when in mood for fried chicken or waffle. But will skip collard green and go with something else."}
{"text":"Im from Atlanta Ga , and we know good down home cooking. When I tell you this food is good.... it's a understatement. The food and the people are outstanding! The only thing I can compare this food to is \"family reunion food\" and if you're from the south you know what i mean ...."}
{"text":"Very good soul food!  I had the soul plate with friend chicken, okra, and cheese grits.  It was all insane!  The drumsticks are huge, nice and crispy.  I would definitely check it out if you want soul food."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from overhearing a conversation at a table behind me at another restaurant.  The folks were raving about it.  I had never heard of chicken and waffles before and the thought intrigued me.  I went by myself to check it out before I told friends or brought anyone with me....pretty skeptical.   I was blown away!  The food was AMAZING, the service was phenomenal and all the staff was extremely warm and friendly.  I honestly felt like I was a guest at a friends home for dinner.  I have \"invited myself\" back several times since and has been phenomenal each time."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken and even better waffles. The sweet tea is great but sometimes it can be too sweet. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing from beginning to end. Loved the name and thought we would check it out, Had no idea it was a get seated and sit down restaurant. Waiter was completely fabulous and very attentive. 
The food was SOOO delicious!!!
The drinks come in a large quart jar with many to choose from. 
Husband had catfish (said it came with 2 pieces but it actually was 4), smothered potatoes, cornbread and mac n cheese.'
I had smothered chicken breast with waffle and cheesy grits on the side, 
The smothered part (gravy and grilled onions) was amazing. The chicken was huge, the grits were mouth watering and the waffle was perfect. 
We left with a HUGE box of leftovers after stuffing ourselves and couldn't even order their famous red velvet cake. We'll have to leave room for it next time."}
{"text":"Let me just put it this way.... I set up a yelp account just to write this review! It was that GOOD! The chicken was just as good if not better then my boyfriends mom's fried chicken..... Now that saying something! You must go and try this place is Soooooo GOOD if we lived here it would become a once a week thing! 

Happy eating, T"}
{"text":"The 5 of us waited over an hour for our food. My mac n cheese looked like they gave me the scorched part that they scraped from the pan before they washed the pan. The potatoes were actually a grayish color, the chicken tasted nasty. I sent my food back. Didn't eat. Sent corporate 2 emails - they never responded. Smh

Won't go back."}
{"text":"Food is very good! Service is very slow! 30 min for a drink really! It was not even busy!"}
{"text":"It is certainly an interesting combination. I thought my friend was joking when he brought up Lo-Lo's, so we went there immediately for proof of life and I ordered a typical chicken/waffle dish. I went to work on it, pretending to be civilized as I mauled the chicken. Feeling like a King of the round table I was rapidly inhaling pancakes. I forgot  whether we were at breakfast or dinner, but either way it hit the spot for both moods. My stomach left slightly confused, perhaps due to a record eating pace. I will definitely be going back here, trying to squeeze in that quarterly visit."}
{"text":"Excellent Chicken and Waffles just as advertised but forced valet parking is stupid. Management needs to allow self parking."}
{"text":"lo-los's food is amazing. way better than roscoes chicken n waffles.

compared to roscoes:
the waffles taste the same, the chicken taste better, getting drinks in mason
jars was pretty cool, the corn bread and mac n cheese was way better than roscoes. but what gives lo-lo's the better restaraunt is the service. the service is very friendly. our orders were right when we received our food. the servers kept coming back to check on things and refill drinks.

i also dont know of too many restaraunts that have a kool-aid
logo in the beverage section"}
{"text":"First off I would have gave them 0 stars if that was an option. Used to go to the old location always great quality. Ordered a bunch of sides first off they had told me it would be ready when I got there ended up waiting 40 minutes for one of the sides. 

ONLY TO COME HOME TO REALIZE EVERYTHING I GOT WAS GARBAGE AND HAD TO THROW IT AWAY."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Lo-Lo's and I'm now officially a fan. I had the mix and match that consisted of a fried chicken breast, a fried strip of catfish, a waffle, and some Mac'N Cheese. Both the chicken and catfish were moist on the inside and crispy on the out. The mac was creamy and fresh and the waffle had a hint of cinnamon. I will definitely be going back to try some other menu items. Oh, and they have Kool-Aid on tap if you have the need..."}
{"text":"Other than highlighting some of the excellent side dishes, I'm not sure what I can add to the other excellent reviews. The collard greens are frackin' fantastic, and I order them every time. My Baby Mama likes to order the fried okra, which she raves about at the most random times (playing disc golf, watching Dr. Who, playing euchre). I also tend to order the home fries, though I've had to deal with an underdone potato or two.

My father-in-law was in town last weekend and wanted to treat us to fried chicken. We suggested Lolo's. WARNING -- read on only if you feel very little empathy for others. Otherwise, the next sentence might break your heart...OK, ready? He showed up with a bucket of KFC. Sadness.

Last word? Lolo's has the best chicken and most complimentary side dishes in Phoenix, hands down."}
{"text":"Oh my! We had a late breakfast here on Friday morning, and I was still feeling full at 6:30 p.m.  I remember eating at the old location 10 years ago and was very happy to see the business has grown.  Love the southern feeling decor and music. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere was really good however we were told the full menu is not available in the morning.  :( ok no biggie. The chicken I was served was clearly fried the day before and then refried when I ordered it. Tha catfish beniet were under cooked. Rather than complain I just decided to bag it up and take it home and put it in the oven. I must say the Central location is way better!"}
{"text":"If you come to AZ you NEED to come to lo-lo's chicken and waffles. The best fried chicken and the best waffles. It also comes with cool aid. Only problem is that it is about a 1-2 hour wait."}
{"text":"this place is HOT in all aspects. their chicken is damn good and the atmosphere in the place does get a little too hot at times. it's awesome though! i like the friendly service they provide. 

the food is very RICH especially their iced tea, it's like drinking pure sugar, soooo good... sometimes - like once a year. but other than that the food is great!! i suggest trying it out and see for yourself. i love fried chicken and waffle so i can't really complain. their corn bread is good too! it makes me salivate just thinking about the greasiness. YUMMM!!!"}
{"text":"The food, drinks, and hot sauce here are superb. Just don't expect too much of your server.

To clarify, indifferent or middling service won't keep me away when the food is this good. It's a small price to pay, and let's be honest, Lo-Lo's is insanely crowded most of the time, so the servers have a lot on their plate, so to speak. I'll cut them some slack.

I had a melon mojito, which was delicious. Just heavenly. I couldn't taste much alcohol in it, but it tasted so good, I didn't care. That's quite a statement to make, especially considering their mojitos cost $6 each. But honestly, it was enchanting. I can't wait to try more of their drinks.

We were a party of three, we were served separately and in pieces... first, one of my friends got his food, then about 5 minutes later, I got a side of my meal, and then another 5 minutes later, I got the rest of my meal, but it took an additional 15 minutes for them to come out with my boyfriend's food. That's excessive. But then again, the food was so delicious, we didn't really care, and neither should you. 

Once the food arrived, it was incredibly delicious. Any annoyance about our service was immediately wiped clean from my consciousness with the first bite of heavenly fried chicken. Ultimately, we come here for the food and drink, right? Lo-Lo's hit it out of the park in that area. 

The environment was fun and welcoming, too. There is a DJ that plays in the back. There are couches outside for when you're overcome with the itis after your meal. 

There were a few other minor complaints I had about the service, but they were minor, and easily forgotten with the delicious food and drink and fun environment. In sum, come here to enjoy yourself and enjoy some good food, and know your servers are working hard to bring you the best, so chill out and wait patiently."}
{"text":"We had never been to Lolos before and were eager to try it.  When we got there, we found a spot and parked.  The hostess from inside came out and told us we had to use the valet. For a chicken and waffle place???? WTF?? I own a very nice car and didn't want their 19 year old valet driver driving it.  I don't even let my boyfriend drive it. So.... we left.    I can't base my star rating on anything other than that experience since we never even made it in the door, so one star."}
{"text":"I've noticed that this place has gotten a majority of 5 stars, well that may be due to the awesome chicken with the tasty skin that you just have to devour, and the greens that had me picking up my bowl and consuming the goods like 3 year old, but can I get some room, please! 
I'm knocking elbows with everyone around me. When I want to fully enjoy my meal I want all of it to go into my mouth, not down my shirt because the person behind me had to get up and shoved my chair right to the table. No elbows on the table here; there's no room!!! 
oh, and the mac n' cheez is good and all but why is it after 2 bites I taste nothing but cream of mushroom soup and not cheese.....just a thought! 
and that is why I give 4 stars and not 5......"}
{"text":"What is up with the low reviews?  The breading was crispy but light not hard, the collards amazing, the butter was salted and delicious and syrup so thick it left trails like glue.  The chicken was super juicy and well seasoned, so that my son hated to put hot sauce on it because he couldn't taste the seasoning on the chicken.  I have only had chicken and waffles in 3 states and it is still top notch in my book.  I guess the lower ratings could be because the waffles weren't all that crispy."}
{"text":"Some co-workers talked me into Lo Lo's, so I tried it.  Loved it, but thought I could feel the blood flow in my arteries slow down.  The food is great tasting, but it may not prolong your life.  But, hey, none of us can live forever.  Their chicken is the best, cooked golden brown and crispy.

The restaurant is located just south of downtown Phoenix in an old house.  There is not much space inside the house, so if you go there for lunch, leave early.  There are lines out the front door after 12 noon.  If you are in Phoenix, you have to try Lo Lo's.  There is nothing else like it."}
{"text":"This is the first place I take my out-of-town visitors. You can't beat the amount of food you get for the price you pay! Plus, blue kool-aid!! I always recommend the Betty's Boob and my friends are never disappointed. Plus, this is the perfect spot during spring training!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Lo Lo's! Went tonight in search of a satisfying dinner and they didn't disappoint.

We both ordered the Lo Lo's plate: three pieces of fried chicken and two generously sized round waffles on each plate! So much food!  Really great stuff, it tasted homemade, like something we'd cook ourselves. It was so comforting and delicious. The service was lightening fast, too. We also like that the drinks are served in big mason jars. Some of the best iced tea we've ever had. Great decor, cool atmosphere. Jazz playing  through the speakers. Very comfortable and welcoming vibe. Lots of smiles from hostesses and servers. Good family restaurant, but also a cute date place!

Cannot wait to go back and try the grits, mac and cheese, etc. Pretty extensive and delicious  looking menu. So many choices!"}
{"text":"The waffle here was great. It had a unique taste to it compared to other waffles. The chicken was very good also. The reason I give them 3 stars is the chicken was not dropped fresh, because it didn't have that heat and crunch to it. I didn't go at a very busy time either. I just think I got dealt a bad hand. I will see when I go back. Overall great place to eat."}
{"text":"I decided to go to Lo-Lo's on fathers day and there was a two hour wait which I understand being that restaurants are usually busy on holidays. Once seated, I received service immediately and my waitress was great. When I received my food, my waffle was not even warm enough to melt the butter that I spread on it. My chicken looked really old and greasy and had a dark brown color to it. My grits were completely undercooked and hard... The waitress informed me that my chicken looked normal to her but that she would replace my entire meal. When I received my new plate, the waffle was a little warmer but the chicken taste really old and the grits were still hard.... I will stick to Roscoes in LA Lo-Lo's... Fresh food is the best way to keep a customer happy. Good luck"}
{"text":"My family && I are visiting in Phoenix and this place was recommended. This food is delicious! I had the Lil Amadi ($7): the waffle was soft with a hint of cinnamon and the two thighs were crunchy && flavorful! My sister had Malaysia's Focheezy Juicy Hood Burger (12) && she liked it. My parents both had a Soulfood Platter ($15 each). The two pieces of catfish were at least 8\" each, the chicken fried chicken was huge, about 6-8\" in diameter. Each of the sides came in a generous portion as well. Fried okra, mac n cheese, whipped potatoes && fries. 

I barely finished my one waffle && two thighs. My appetite isn't small either. My sister finished her burger but neither of my parents finished their meals. The price is good for the amount of food you receive. 

We're considering coming back again before we head out of town."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast on a trip to Scottdale. Had the KK special.  Grits were of the hook! Husband said breast was the best piece of chicken out of the three. ...seasoned good with the right amount of crisp. Service very friendly!"}
{"text":"First time experience with Chicken and Waffles for breakfast.  Well prepared, delicious and filling. The service was good. I was a little uncomfortable at first being  a total newbie to southern food and hospitality, but I will definitely return for more."}
{"text":"Oh Hell yes, this place is delicious!

The hubs and I went while we were running errands. He had the platter, with fried chicken, cheesy grits, fried okra and corn bread. I had the Betty Boop (#8) which consists of a piece of fried chicken and a waffle.

It was so freaking delicious. Not healthy in any shape or form, but it was delicious. The fried chicken is salty, and juicy and very well cooked, and the waffle (with real butter & syrup on top) was just sweet enough to make you go back for more.

The joint was clean, staff was incredibly nice, food came out fast, and it was very reasonably priced. If I didn't care about fitting into my clothes, I'd be back more often."}
{"text":"For some I assume this would be a grand experience. My guess is that it would be for the same people who would label this as a \"Soul Food\" restaurant. In my home however, it is simply food. Regular old, Sunday night  food. Good food: absolutely. Exceptional food: nah. 

Maybe this is because  the mac and cheese and fried chicken taste exactly the same as what I place on my table for family get-togethers. However, if it is food that you do not know how to cook on your own I would suspect that you'd find it delightful. 

Pros: mac & cheese and fried chicken are very good. Homefries are to die for. Good service and drinks are served in jars (gotta love that).

Cons: You have to wait in the blistering heat to be seated, the place is extremely small and don't be fooled by the Famous red velvet cake. It taste like red cornbread with icing and walnuts. Very good icing and walnuts but all the same just a spiced up cornbread.

Overall: Good experience. Good food and yes if I head out of Cali to Phoenix again I will go back."}
{"text":"I've always thought Roscoe's was THE place to go for chicken and waffles... until I had Lo-Lo's.

The place is pretty small, but they are big on food. The first time i went, our portions were huge - good enough for two leftover meals. I learned on my second visit to not over do myself.

The chicken is well cooked - the meat is still juicy and moist on the inside, while the outside batter is fried to crispy perfection.

The side of mac and cheese was the best I've had in a while - it seemed to have sauteed onions with multiple types of cheese as the base.

The waffles were slightly disappointing and soggy on both of my visits - perhaps this is a personal preference though,"}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat. Great food and a friendly environment. Some of the best fried chicken I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have been able to find Lo-Lo's without GPS...but now that I have, I'll definitely be going back.

The southern fried chicken was crunchy, tasty, finger lickin' good (take that KFC)...and the thin buttery waffle also had a nice crisp edge, although next time I'm gonna try for extra crispy waffles...the mac & cheese was velvety smooth & rich...my first bite of rice & beans was an epiphany - the savory sauce was a perfect contrast against the sweetness of the waffles and crusty corn muffin - I now know that I have never truly had rice and beans before Lo-Lo's.

But my favorite was actually the fried catfish...dusted with cornmeal for a dry (not oily) crunch into oh-so tender flaky catfish.  I would have loved to order another one, but I was bursting.  However, as I went up to pay, I could not help but notice that luscious hunk of Red Velvet cake slathered with cream cheese frosting and studded with walnut...I gave into the siren call and ordered a piece to take home.  Unfortunately, the cake turned out to be a bit of a letdown despite being plenty moist - no taste of chocolate to be found and the icing was a tad thin.

The other thing I didn't like was the coffee, which was kind of watery...but hey that's kinda authentic too.

The waitress was friendly and attentive.  When we told her that our eggs still had not hit the table even though we were almost done with the rest of the food, she offered us a choice of any side to take home.   This kind of service is rare and is also why I want to go back."}
{"text":"Asked the Mrs. where she wanted to go for her birthday dinner. She could have picked anywhere, sky's the limit, and she picked Lo Lo's! 

It ended up being a fantastic pick; great food, huge portions, and our waitress Richael was so engaging and made our first time that much more special. Can't wait to get back & try their breakfast!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite lolos to eat at until recently. The last two visits I've had terrible service. I got there and they had a 15 minute wait, which is fine, but they proceeded to sit a couple who had come in after, before they even sat us. I asked the hostess about it and she apologized. So we get seated and it's a good five minutes before anyone comes and greets us. She takes our drink order, drops them off and disappears. I waited 15 minutes before I called over a different waitress to see if she could take our order. My original waitress is off taking care of everyone and never bothers to come back until well after we've received our food.

Love the food but after two bad experiences, I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"My wife & I tried the new lo-lo's this past Saturday 12/06/14.  It had a very good atmosphere, very open & good seating. Since we had never been there before we decided to go with 2 completely different meals. She went with the chicken & waffles I chose Burger & fries. Server was very friendly & knowledgeable. When food arrived, burger was good & chicken was ok, not something I would wake up on the weekend & make a point to go out of my way or change my plans to get to. A little pricey for the meal but trying it for the first time ok. This is where it gets interesting. If you go Do Not, I repeat Do Not park on your own.  They share the parking lot with the Holiday Inn next door & neither business is sure who owns what as far as the parking arangment goes. You will be towed ($125) & on your own to get your car back. The food is good but the parking arrangment leaves a lot to be desired. They offer valet, but no one will stop you and tell you the difference until it is way to late. Needless to say we will not being going back."}
{"text":"The first time my boyfriend and I ever went to Lo-Lo's was in April of last year. And back then, it was just a house with a modestly sized dining area. It was a bit of a hole in a wall, but the food and service was far from disappointing. :) We went again not too long ago, and they upgraded to a larger building. Of course, the food was still amazing. The koolaid and lemonade is a bit too sweet, even for my taste (which is saying something, because I LOVE sweets), but still good. Oh, but the food. OGAD,THE FOOD.

So good.
SO GOOD.
If you haven't tried Lo-Lo's yet THEN YOU DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND HOW GOOD THEY ARE."}
{"text":"Lolos is my spot man other than the long wait but that cant be help.  Stupid fries and phat azz burger are delicious"}
{"text":"Liked the old location better!  Parking is impossible at new site, loud music is a turn off, and food quality has suffered!"}
{"text":"The good: 
New location is gorgeous. Terrific decor and atmosphere. 
Food is great. Waffles are light and fluffy. Chicken is a little salty but very tasty. 

The bad: 
I called in my take out order from home, and got to the restaurant about 15 mins later. I still waited abut 15+ mins for my food. 
While waiting aman who was obviously a vagrant came in and asked for a glass of water. The hostesses ( there was two) got the manager, he said ok and ask the guy to have a seat. The gentleman literally sat leg to leg with me, held out his fist  for a fist bump with me and leaned in for a whisper. Well after I fist bumped him, he whispered in my ear how he's out on his luck and needs $50 for some oxy..... After I said I didn't have any cash, he said no prob, and kept rambling on to me about how much pain he's in. Yeah it took the manager at least 4+ mins to get this guy a cup if water. While both hostess tried to look busy and not look at me and my new BFF.  After the guy left they continued to ignore me, didn't say why my food technically took 30 mins. Or apologize for sitting a drug addict next to me and hit me up for a 50 spot. 

Price. I ordered a total of 3 waffles and 2 chicken wings. The price came out to $16.52. Market average for Premium Jumbo Chicken wings is 1.99(http://consumermeats.com/details.php?id=2220&c=45&s=&pqn=&name=Fresh-premium-jumbo-chicken-wings-40lbs-case.) that's .67 cents each. If you add .25 per waffle ( on the high side) that's $2.08 plate cost.  Yeah 800% markup on a 13% food cost. Ridiculous price markup for a 2 diamond fine dining restaurant let alone a chicken and waffle joint. 

Staff: I was there on a sunday morning about 9am. The place was about a 1/4 full.  I thought I noticed a lot of staff floating around, so i decided to count.  There was :
1 Front of the house manager
2-3 Hostesses
5-6 wait staff
1-2 bust boys 
And a whole kitchen full of other people I count count. 
Front of the house alone there was 1 staff for every 2 customers.  Ridiculous. 

Overall thoughts : Good food, great new location. Slow, egregiously mis managed, grossly expensive, poor customer service. Will return in 2013 and see if any things been fixed."}
{"text":"Oh thank you, crispy waffles and chicken... Services was a little slow, however, the food made up for it. 

Tricky to get parking so if you're on the run park in the shopping market, walk over, it'll save you time. 

Still, thank you, thank you, thank you!"}
{"text":"Love this place ! Food is great and on point . Place is very busy and interactive . Good service and I also like how one of the servers could memorize the order without having to write anything Down . Only thing I dnt like is the front desk Hispanic girl. She's not very polite and gave my friend a dirty look  without any reasoning . Just rude ."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff. Had to wait 45 minutes for food on top of the 45 minutes to be seated. And was ignored by the manager."}
{"text":"This is the best place in Phoenix for real waffles and chicken! Home style and authentic. Love me some good soul food.... hmmm yum."}
{"text":"Good place, good food, good people...but I'm from LA so Roscoe's will always have my heart lol."}
{"text":"Yummy Chicken!  Great Mac & Cheese.What more could you ask for??"}
{"text":"We had passed this place a few times and were trying to determine the appeal of chicken and waffles.  Not being from the 'South' this was a curiosity.  So we stopped in of a week night and ordered up dinner.  One humongous hamburger and a fish dish to be exact.  The burger apparently went over pretty well with the hubs, and my fish was good, but not well...great.  The latter had a healthy portion of fish over a spoonful of rice, veggies and lukewarm sauce.  Lemonade was sickenly sweet - couldn't drink it.  Overall, it's pretty pricey for what you get - disappointingly so.  We escaped, including beverages and a modest tip, for just under $50.  Not adding to our repeat places to eat."}
{"text":"30 minute wait but so worth it! The blue Kool-aid is the best and the sauce for the fried green tomatoes is amazing. The waffles weren't what I expected and I loved them. Not too sweet! The fried chicken is spot on, delicious, fresh, home cooked food!"}
{"text":"The chicken was dry, which is weird because that's supposed to be their whole thing.
Also, kind of overpriced."}
{"text":"Lolo's is ridiculously good! I usually get fried chicken smothered in gravey and onions with a waffle on the side. There is nothing about this food that's good for you, but your taste buds will thank you!
I've been to Lolo's several times and I've always had to wait in line for a table. Parking isn't so great either, so you may have to walk a block or so after you find a spot."}
{"text":"We LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! If it were closer to our house we would eat here weekly instead of once a month. Love the chicken, waffles, cornbread, mac and cheese, grits and the ambiance."}
{"text":"What can I say about the food. This chicken was ok the crust good but the chick was dry. Kool-aid was good. Our waitress did scratch her ass in front of us my which made the whole dining experience a bust. Stay away from the red velvet cake NASTY!!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our food.  Large portions of everything. Hubby and I actually split a meal. 
2 Waffles, 3 fried chicken, 2 eggs, side of grits. 

Lemonade and kool aid in big mason jars.  
No need for a refill.   My girl had a chicken salad also did it finish it was so large.   And good quality.   You get your money's worth. 
Clean, quick and friendly service 

Only negative is this is chain soul food restaurant.   Nothing authentic about any of it.  Level set your expectations.  But would return again."}
{"text":"Love the food. Great atmosphere & fairly priced . The reason for 4 stars is because the hostess DRUU was very rude, she had an attitude with nearly everyone I seen her interact with. Just over all lacked counter service skills. Not polite at all. Do better."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the few places that my family eats fried chicken.  The waffles are crispy and lite so delicious.  The new restaurant is much bigger than the former but the atmosphere is busy with customers and workers throughout.  
My grown daughter order kook-aid, she said, \"it's so good.\"   
Lo-lo's is very good food but be prepared to pay for it. $$"}
{"text":"The music is FABULOUS but too loud. Anyway, my husband and I have been here 3 times. The shrimp and grits are delicious but if you don't like your food burning your mouth, ask them to hold the spice. The waffles and chicken are delish and the cobbler is too. I wish there were a Lo-Lo's in Denver. My husband tells me there is now one in the Phoenix Airport. Nice!"}
{"text":"Chicken 5 stars, service 1 star.

Best chicken I've ever had in AZ!  I ordered the Betty Boop, a breast of chicken and a waffle. The waffle, was meh, reminded me of an eggo waffle, and the breast was amazing especially with Lo-Los hot sauce, chicken on the bone!!!

The nicest thing I can say about the service is that it was unusual.  I was with a group of five and we got seated at a table normally fit for four.  We decided to move to a more suitable table.  Our waiter was friendly and took our drink orders. When he dropped off our drinks he lost track of what was diet coke and was dr pepper and had us do a taste test, no big deal, just kind of funny. We received our food quickly.  

We didn't realize it when we went to Lo-Los, but apparently a group of five is considered a \"big group\", requiring a mandatory 18% tip and Lo-Los would not split our checks separately.  It took approximately 20 minutes after we finished eating to receive our check. We went to the cash register to pay our bill they let us split the bill and put it on 2 cards, unfortunately the cashier charged us for the wrong amount ($20 more than our bill) we informed the cashier of this and she took our cards back and said she credited the amount and charged the correct amount.  So overall I was charged $64 dollars for a piece chicken and a waffle, still waiting for the credit to appear on my bank statement. This place was a little disappointing."}
{"text":"I just wanted to thank Lolos Chicken & waffles Phoenix location for the great meal and wonderful service. The staff was extremely professional and pleasant to have waiting on our table. This was our first time visiting and we were impressed. Even though the place was busy it was very enjoyable. Food was served quick, hot & fresh! Will definitely be returning and recommending to family & friends. The only thing I wish there was, would be a kids menu but the staff was helpful on pointing out which items were a good pick for young children.


Thanks again Lolos Chicken and Waffles!"}
{"text":"Who ever heard of putting mushrooms in mac and cheese?! They did, and it works - my mushroom hating husband finished his entire side of it! 
This was a first-time for me with eating chicken and waffles together, and it was wonderful! Their waffles are really good with a hint of vanilla and the chicken is fried perfectly. They also make the best sweet tea I've had in Arizona - as close to North Carolina's as I've had in the Southwest! Get the \"Betty Boop\" you can't go wrong! :)"}
{"text":"So have been here when they first opened as a ghetto joint and now with all the nice remodeling 
The food is still good (u might get a heart attack or cavity w the sugar in their kool-aid) but one thing that hasn't changed is the service is still as slow as dang molasses. 
I have a toddler now and the long wait to get service, drinks, and our food was not sitting well with her or me. 40 min wait to get seated, 10 min for a waiter to appear, close to an hour for food and waiter to reappear. 
I think if you're looking for a place to go hang with adults to catch up; the wait is worth the wait. 

Dress code: ghetto to fab to ghetto fab is all gravy in here."}
{"text":"The food and service at this location is great. I was recently in AZ twice, and I went here to eat 3 times during my visit. This is my go-to spot for great Southern food, ambiance, and excellent customer service. Also, love that they have FREE valet service. LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"You can't get better fried chicken than this! Combine with a pleasantly crispy on the outside and soft chewy inside waffle. Yummy! Yes. They have a daily Koolaid! Definitely will be back the next time I'm in Phoenix. A little tip. Add some of the hot sauce to your chicken as you eat. It's a great spiciness without being burn your mouth hot"}
{"text":"New Years Day experience: The kitchen was totally unprepared for crowds. 45 minute wait for food. Greeter and wait staff friendly.  Kept apologizing for delay. Several folks asked to speak to manager to complain but no one showed up to talk to customers. Huge delays, kitchen absolutely unorganized. Worst dinner experience and we've been coming here for years. Who's managing the kitchen staff? No one!!!"}
{"text":"I wish this place was closer to where I live. But I suppose it's a good thing it's not or I'd be there too much.

I'd been wanting to try Lolo's since I heard about them. A place specializing in chicken and waffles? I'm there! But it was too far away to make just popping on down practical. 

Then one day I was actually in the neighborhood and got a chance to go. The interior of the place is unique, with lots of interesting things to look at. There are several flatscreen TVs and the menus were fun. 

The sheer amount of food you get is amazing. The chicken was almost exactly what my mom used to make when I was a kid. I wanted to have dessert afterward but filled up on the happiness that was the two-leg and a waffle combo. I had the blue drank, a mason jar of blue Koolaid that was endless. I didn't actually need a refill though. One jar was enough for me. 

Our waitress was friendly and genuine. There was complimentary valet parking though we found a spot on the street easy enough. The overall atmosphere there was laid back and relaxing. I had a good time and great food. As I said before, I'd go there more often if it were only closer. If you've been thinking about trying this place, get off the fence and into the restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but if you put \"Red Drink\" or \"Purple Drink\" as options on your menu, you pretty much can guarantee I will be a fan.  Luckily, the food didn't disappoint, or I would have been pretty sad.  

Chicken, waffles, and grits?  Yes, please.  I didn't even look up except to nod when she asked if I wanted a refill on my purple drink.  Lots of combinations on the menu to make anyone happy, good portion sizes, and fun waitstaff.  Wish I could go back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Lo-Lo's for a long time since I've heard so many good things about it, and last night we finally went. All those good reviews are totally justified! The food is amazing! Not just the chicken and waffles, but the fried okra, the fried green tomatoes (yeah, everything fried), and the drinks (Lo-Lo's Punch is super good). Our server was Bruce, and Lo-Lo's, you need to do everything in your power to keep him happy and working for you because he made dinner a better experience in every way. He was funny, courteous, and willing to make suggestions about what my daughter might like better than her first choice. I can't afford to eat like this too often or my heart will explode, but I will definitely be back with a big smile!"}
{"text":"This is the only place I know of to get decent chicken and waffles that isn't all contemporary up styled. 

Service can be pretty bleh. The wait times can get ridiculous, but that is not such a bad issue. 

NO take out, odd. But whatever. Also not the worst since I can order at the bar and get a to go box PLUS this food is best eaten fresh!

I keep coming back, but, they tend to bring out lukewarm fried chicken, a big no no. Greens aren't the tender variety, so if you like tender greens, don't order here. 

Management at both Gilbert & Scottsdale locations are bad oh so bad."}
{"text":"Love the food, but they changed to mandatory valet parking.. fail x 100

Really? Why? 

Fix this! At least one of the two lots should be self parking."}
{"text":"I was on another work-related trip when I came to experience by far the best chicken and waffles I ever eaten.
As I was walking into the hotel were conference I was attending was being held in Phoenix, I was immediately greeted by my colleagues who were fortunate enough to get there a couple of days before i did. Fortunate because they got a chance to go to see a couple of games at spring training. As I met them, they were looking to cure their hangover with some chicken and waffles. Lo-lo's was suggested by our colleague who used to work at Arizona State University and a great suggestion. 
I ordered two pieces of chicken and waffles with grits and eggs. To wash all down I also had their signature sweet tea that came in a jar. The chicken were moist but not swimming in oil and the grits completed the meal. My colleagues hangovers were satisfied as was I. I would love to go back to Lo-lo's but given the new law in AZ, I don't I'll be going there anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and joyful space. Definitely worth the experience, if you've never had chicken and waffles! The combo is delicious. They have other selections of food; Southern comfort food complete with Kool aid and sweet tea :)"}
{"text":"Ehhh. Am I the only person in Scottsdale that isnt wow'd by this place? It was ok. Ive had much better waffles elsewhere and the chicken wasn't that great. It was good.
$3 for a glass of kool-aid isn't  something I think is necessary, either. Fries were cold and soggy, grits were watery and tasteless. Super loud and crowded - you're pretty much sitting on top of the people next to you. I'm glad we went and tried it out, but I think once was enough for me."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. I had a male server who could not have been more misogynistic. He insulted his female coworkers, basically saying they were too dumb to do things correctly. Before I even ordered anything, he told me I didn't have to order a salad, and that if I order some real food he won't judge me. His snarky comments, impatience, and rude attitude culminated into a terrible experience -- so much so that we couldn't even enjoy the food because we had become so enraged and just wanted to leave. I'm sure the food tastes just fine, but the sour taste of a disgusting attitude was all we left with. No amount of supposedly good food can bring me back to eat at this place."}
{"text":"I have no idea what all the hype is about the waffles are not that good, but, fired chicken is pretty good."}
{"text":"Man I love this place!  The service is always good and the food is always delicious.  Sometimes the wait can be moderate.  I get the chicken strips usually and a single waffle which fills me up.  Since the chicken fingers are double battered it can be really filling.  I tried the chicken fingers with only a single batter (by request) and it was even better.  Only reason there is not a fifth star is due to the space.  I feel crowded when I'm eating.  No big deal.  Highly recommend some cool-aid too!"}
{"text":"I love fried chicken and LoLo's has great fried chicken. Now as some of the others have mentioned it is salty but it's not over the top. It actiually has an amazing flavor with a little more spice than you get at most places.it is also crispy instead of that weird softly breaded junk you usually get when you order fried chicken in Arizona. The Mac and Cheese is to die for and so are the potatoes. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Ok very bad customer service! They treat the white ppl better than the african americans most of my best friends are white I have nothing against white ppl :) the ppl here are just plan forgetful they just sit your food down anywhere dont ask whos plate is who's but as I was watching they where extremly happy to serve the white ppl even smiled when serving others and I am an awesome tipper but these ppl will not get anything extra out of me I will be sure to give them the exact change and never return again!"}
{"text":"Love Lo-Lo's, place is in a great atmosphere and it makes you feel right at home. The service is awesome they give you what you ask them and so friendly too. Everything on the menu is amazing especially when I order my smothered fried chicken, lost for words just talking about it. Anyway this is a place to go to if you like southern culture and it brings you into that mood. I would recommend to bring your family or your friends its that good."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Chicken was good. Never had chicken & waffles before. If the service were better I would try it again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer and piece of chicken. Food was good.. Service was horrible. Really not interested in taking care of anyone. No beer on tap (all broken). Bud light happy hour price $4.  For a bud light!! Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The girlfriend and I drove by and I caught it out of the corner of my eye and asked myself 2 questions. Fried chicken? and waffle? Both were answered yes by my stomach and in we went.

I'd heard a lot of people talk about this place in the past and didn't even know that there was one on Scottsdale Road. Didn't really bother to peek at the menu so when the waiter walked up and asked what I wanted I said,\" chicken and waffles.\" When he said how much chicken and waffles I said,\" Lots!\" I got stymied for a moment when he asked if I wanted the chicken country style or smothered but decided to go smothered.

The waiter brought me a massive plate of deliciously tender chicken and just-right waffles, and he did the same for my girlfriend (she opted for unsmothered though). I feel like I ate for several hours and still barely finished the 2 breasts, 1 leg, and 2 waffles (I'm sure there's a name for that on the menu). After dinner I really thought I might womlet, which is a reference to a less-awesome combination I tried in the past, an omelet-topped waffle. I actually felt like I might womlet for several hours after that as well. Will that iffy feeling in my stomach caused by the unholy union of gravy, hot sauce, chicken, maple syrup, waffles, and coffee stop me from eating there. Oh Hell No!!! I fully plan on going back just as soon as I can fit back into pants that don't have elastic waistbands..."}
{"text":"A funny story....My father, who has lived in over 20 states, was very skeptical about chicken and waffles together.  My parents came down here from Colorado to visit for a few months.  They wanted to try some of the great food Phoenix has to offer.  So, I said Lolo's, of course,was one of the places to go.  After the first time going, he said that Chicken and Waffles is one of the best combos that he has ever had and their waffles reminded him of the belgium waffles of New York City in the 60s.  My father in the following months wanted to go there a few time before he left and always left happy.

Their chicken is so crisp, yet very moist still on the inside. The waffles will never let you down either.  I am happy someone has fried okra in their town and my nieces love the macaroni and cheese and their various DRANKS of kool-aid.  My wife always has to have their sweetened tea, while I have to go with the grape drank!  Reminds me of the south and childhood!"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre for soul food but at least it's available from Arizona, so if you are from Arizona, you might consider it to be great. But, the issue I had today was the service. Now onto the service, our group (table of 5), only 3 received their food together, then after reminding the waiter about the other 2 plates (30 minutes later), they are brought. Then when the waiter is informed allowing us to speak with the manager about the service, he brings a dude of non intimidation to inform us that \"we cannot do any adjustments to the bill, was food hot?, and did you eat?\" 

WOW... what type of customer service are you representing? So since this was my idea to invite the coworkers, I will pick a restaurant that appreciates their customers as patrons'.

{"text":"This is for sure a must have if you're new to phoenix! The thing is that the remodel is beautiful. They do have another location in Scottsdale,however this one I would say is the better one. Its very clean. The servers are great and friendly. 

You cannot go wrong with any thing you order here. It's really all good. You will find something for everyone."}
{"text":"I got the betty boobs DD, two chicken breasts and a waffle and ordered an extra side of mac n cheese and literally everything I tried was the best I had ever had. It's amazing."}
{"text":"We went for a late lunch during the week and were seated immediatley! The staff was very attentive and helpful. Our waitress Dee Dee even made it economical for us when deciding what to order. I personally tried the \"Nay Nay's\" which included two waffles, eggs and grits. I added a thigh on the side to try. I really enjoyed everything. I've also have had Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in LA and they do compare in many ways. Lo Lo's makes a crispier waffle than Roscoe's. Overall the food was great. It came out fast and hot!! I will be visiting again."}
{"text":"I have been eating at lo los for awhile but this is the first time to the new location. It is quite allot bigger and they even have valet parking.

Everything is pretty much the same from a food standpoint.  I always get the toy toy and the chicken was as crispy as ever. The only disappointing thing was the soggyness of the pancake.


I can't really judge the desserts as I never have room for them."}
{"text":"I've heard of this place for years and finally went today. The food was obviously fresh and absolutely delicious! It's very filling as well, lots of leftovers. Definitely recommend this place, can't wait to go back and try something new!!"}
{"text":"Sketchy area.  But oh so worthin gooood.  Chicken is on point.  Waffles with cinnamon, delish.  The RED punch is the best (extra ice).  Will be back."}
{"text":"So yummy! I saw the overall score and I thought that was not representative of the quality or customer service of this wonderful establishment. The food is unbelievably tasty and wholesome! I've lived in the South and you can't go wrong with Lolo's."}
{"text":"Enjoy the chicken waffles and sweet tea. Service was good."}
{"text":"I don't make it to Lo-Lo's enough but the food is delicious. I love how you can order pieces of chicken a-la carte, and the prices are reasonable too. The menu is highly amusing/entertaining, and the drinks are delicious. The service is always great here as well :)"}
{"text":"Ive been there before and enjoyed it. Today we went again and I ordered chicken tender basket. My wife ordered the same thing I ordered except she wanted a waffle and I had fries. Our server brought out my wifes and informed me that tenders take longer. Hmmm. She comes out with my order 5 mins later and my tenders were not seasoned and way over cooked. She took them back and 2 mins later came back with another set of over cooked tenders. She had the nerve to ask me if \"they were ok.\" At that point I was ready to go. She knew damn good and well that they were not right. Then I got my bill and you would think that they would have taken my meal off the bill but nope. Pretty disappointed!"}
{"text":"Absolutley fabulous food and service. Light and airy... See Nick and Tammy...they make you feel so at home. Love everything about this place!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to visit this place because of the extremely positive reviews but was left disappointed in the quality of food and service.  I was there with my brother and the food was delivered at unreasonably different times, letting one of orders get cold.  My fried chicken was obviously cooked beforehand and kept under a heat lamp.  I would be shocked if this was not the case because it was one of the driest fried chickens I have ever had.  I got a breast, thigh, and leg.  The waffle was solid but not enough to make up for the dried out chicken.  I was not a fan of our waitress who made it a bit too obvious that she was trying to upsell us items.  I was not asked about getting a refill on drinks for the entire hour I was there."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time. We are from California, so we compare all chicken and waffles to Roscos. Needless to say, they were way better. The waffles are delicious and the chicken is very flavorful. My only complaint was the service. We got our drinks in a timely fashion. Appetizers came out 20 mins after receiving our drinks but when we got our entrees it was a whole different story. It was 3 of us. They brought out 2 of the 3 entrees and said my food was on the way. 5 mins went by. Then 10 and I still didn't have my food. Finally I got my order. My 2 other friends were more than half the way done. Also, my order was only partial. I ordered the #9 (Lil Almadi) or something like that and a side of Mac and cheese. She said my Mac and cheese was coming. I waited and waited and never got the Mac and cheese. She never even checked on us. It's like she completely forgot about us. I tried to flag her down on several occasions to inquire about my Mac and cheese, but she never noticed us. After 45 mins to an hour of just waiting, we finally got her attention and just ask for our check. It wasn't until I told her to remove the Mac and cheese from our check did she even remember. I spent the entire time here worrying and waiting. I never had the chance to relax and enjoy my meal. Even while I was eating, it felt awkward because my other 2 friends were done and they were just waiting for me to finish eating. I don't mind coming here again because I liked the food. But I will take it to go. I won't be dining here again."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but I was highly disappointed at the food, chicken had mild flavor, but was far to hard to be fresh, the salad was fresh but the vinaigrette dressing was all oil and flavorless. The waffles were good but they were basically pancakes with waffle imprints, not crispy at all like the menu stated. The prices are way to ridiculous for \"hood\" food as they call it. And for a place that claims to serve soul food, there was only one catfish item on the menu, a tiny sandwich. Not worth the trip. The biscuits were ok, but tasted like the flour wasnt sifted well snd I got a couple of clumps of dried dough in mine."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the authentic Gospel music in the background, but our ears were filled with a heavenly chorus as we feasted upon the sacred, and until this morning unknown, pairing of chicken and waffles--a combination rivaled by only bread and wine in it's ability to induce a religious experience."}
{"text":"The best chicken and waffles on planet earth! The atmosphere and food is amazing. You haven't had real sweet tea till you've had Lo Lo's sweet tea! I was on my way to California and cut down to Scottsdale just enjoy this place !"}
{"text":"This is my third trip to Lo Lo's and some  call me Ms. Lolo or nannylolo. Always enjoy the food. Parking lot attendant friendly. Staff is great!!!! One distraction. Two staff at the check-in counter very fast but one was on her phone texting. So the other staff person seated us right away. Appearance is everything for me. IJS"}
{"text":"Their food is so good. The best chicken and waffles in Phoenix. I went on a Sunday and it was a bit of a wait. It was definitely worth the wait though."}
{"text":"I eat at Roscoes Chicken and Waffles often and this place rivals it. Staff was great!! Check on us 5/6 times after we got our food..does get busy but worth it!!"}
{"text":"I got the DD...was too much food for me. Should have just gotten the Betty Boop. The waffle was amazing and the best part of my meal. Sad to say but my chicken breast was really dry (one star lost). I didn't like it at all. Frys food store has more juicy and flavorful fried chicken. I would go back but only to have the waffle and maybe try some other items and hope for better service. I also didn't like how loud the music was. I couldn't hear the people in my party and we were shouting trying to talk to each other (second star lost). It did give me a headache. I also felt the metal chairs were uncomfortable so I stole a regular wood one from the table next over. Lastly, the service wasn't very great. Always trying to find someone to get a refill for us and when they did it would take 10+ minutes (3rd star lost)."}
{"text":"FYI They do not take reservations and there was a very long wait, even on a Monday... Must be good right???
I went for a business meeting, it was pretty great food BUT IT WAS VERY LOUD!!!
The waiter was not very good he didn't check in much and after he brought our dessert and we finished it and brought us boxes he never brought our check and we waited almost 20 minutes for it. You would think that asking for a to go box would be the queue to bring the check but not for that guy.
I love the dark meat chicken it was DELICIOUS but the white meat was so dry I chocked on it. Next time all dark meat.
The Mac and cheese needed a little more salt.
Banana Puddin' was good
Peach cobbler needed something
Chicken fried chicken was fantastic
Sweet Kool-Aid No grape though...:(

ALL IN ALL IT WAS GREAT FOOD BUT THE 3 STAR IS BECAUSE OF THE SERVICE AND THE NO RESERVATION AND THE LONG WAIT AND HOW LOUD IT WAS."}
{"text":"I am certainly not a chicken and waffle aficionado, but I thought that Lo-Los was worth going to at least once.  Both the chicken and the waffle came out very hot, and tasted as though they were cooked for my order.  In addition to the aforementioned chicken and waffle, I ordered a side of cornbread.  Just like the waffle, the corn bread was pretty good too.

I can't complain about grease because I was eating fried chicken.  But, the waffle and cornbread came with what I thought was a crazy amount of butter scooped onto them.  Lo-Los is hardly a health-food restaurant, but if that is what they are going for they are missing terribly.  Nevertheless, I feel as though half a stick of butter is overkill for a modest-sized waffle and a side of cornbread.  

The mason jar of iced tea was also good.  I would expect nothing less from a southern-food restaurant to have good iced tea.  As it turned out, I needed plenty to drink so that I could cut through all the greasy-goodness of the chicken, syrupy-waffle, and buttery-cornbread."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous.... I just tried to place a lunch order that I was going to pay for in full by credit card. We were told that they changed their policy and no longer take phone orders. We were told that we have to come in, in person place the order and wait about 30 while the order is being prepared. Who ever came up with this policy needs to have there head examined..."}
{"text":"What a cool place. I've never experienced chicken and waffles that much prior to going so I was pretty excited. The chicken is great and I found myself stacking the chicken and waffle together on my fork before taking a bite. They go perfectly together. The mixed drinks are awesome bc they use cool aid for a lot of their concoctions."}
{"text":"Forget about the location is Scottsdale you want the location on Central and Yuma."}
{"text":"I had heard such great things about LoLo's chicken and waffles, but I was very disappointed. The appetizers were good but my main dish, the DD, wasn't. The chicken breast was very dry. It should have been quite juicy since I had to wait a long time for my food. Food was overpriced for bad quality."}
{"text":"I have been the token metal head to the original Lolo's for many years. I ventured out to the new location with my sister, brother and my niece and nephew. 
This place is about 4 sizes bigger than the original. We were quoted a 15 min wait on a Saturday morning. We were sat in 5. 

The menu is the same, the china is the same, the \"drank\" glasses are the same. Feels just like a slightly more sterile original Lolo's. 

Waffles were cinnamon-y delicious, chicken was hot and crispy. The catfish was also hot and crispy. Everything except for location felt the same. Which is comforting. 

I'm still a fan of the charm of the original location and will dine there before I dine at the Scottsdale location again."}
{"text":"Lolo's does Soul Food right. Once I heard about this place years ago, I've brought everyone of my family members here at least once. 
The food is good, the service is good, with happy employees serving up the chicken, waffles, mac & cheese, Kool-Aid and Red Velvet cakes. 

I've not had one bad meal in this place. And I was the token metal head, who came weekly. I recommend the Lo-Lo Platter (2 piece chicken, waffle and a side). Or the Catfish platter. Damn good. 
The grits, mac & cheese, collards, fried okra and red beans and rice are all tasty. 
It is a small place, and with that comes a long wait if you come to dine at peak times. I usually get there at 1pm. After all of the downtown office workers bug out and go back to their cubicles. 
I would recommend this place to anyone who appreciates good, old fashion comfort/soul food."}
{"text":"Wow. Love this place. We had the soul food plate with chicken fried chicken, collared greens, and beans on rice. We could have drank the white gravy from a cup it was so good. The service was fantastic and she answered all our questions. (We're as pasty white as it gets and this one of the first soul food experiences for the family.) One tip: the portions are huge so you can share. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Chicken was great as always. but the best part was being taken care of by Mike. He did an outstanding job,  
was extremely friendly and cheerful. A great person."}
{"text":"One word... AMAZING! Love the Chicken & Waffles concept. Also taking home some Red Velvet Cake! :-)"}
{"text":"There was a lot of hype about this place, so decided to check it out. The food and atmosphere was amazing, I got the red kool aid and chicken n waffles. 
On the other hand, the service was crap. The host was rude and had a snarl on her face as she finally decided to seat us. And the server was nice, but messed up our order, no big deal. But never came to check back on us, zero refills. We practically had to beg for the check to leave. I was disappointed. 
I even read reviews beforehand, they are accurate about the service."}
{"text":"Lucky for me I found a cockroach in my food, and got my insect covered meal was free! Needless to say it was a very bad experience and I will never return"}
{"text":"Excellent hospitality and customer service very impressed by the gentlemen who run the business from the waitresses to the security to the general manager everybody's personalities were superb was there during Super Bowl weekend it was crowded to the hilt but this sweet kind dispositions of all the staff made the food more delicious I got excited because people we're partying while they ate socialized and danced to all of our favorite old school modern hip hop music lolos is the best blackened catfish off the hook headed there now before Super Bowl going back today"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat when I come to phoenix. Banana pudding is to die for. Order the pecan waffles with your chicken. The gravy is out of this world. All the sides are fantastic!  This is mama's good ole home cooking comfort food."}
{"text":"Got the #12 meal, it was wonderful! The red velvet cake was delish!! The server was nice and patient. The iced tea was fresh and amazing."}
{"text":"Service is horrible! Been waiting an hour for our food and the food was cold when we got it. The food and service use to be great but it has gone down. I use to come to Lolos at least once a week and the last 3 times the service has been terrible. This will be the last time coming to Lolos. Giving it 1 star is being kind."}
{"text":"Food is good. Excellent waffles! I'm not a huge chicken on the bone fan, but theirs is decent. Always good service. Parking is a pain and they don't take RSVPs so expect to wait."}
{"text":"This is a great place me and my husband went in for breakfast during the week service was good food was better than what I expected.
I recommend to everyone and the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"I used to love Lo-Lo's but I will never eat there again! A few months ago I got so sick after eating at their downtown location! I had diarrhea for two days! I had to miss work it was horrible! I had treated my aunt to lunch as well and she got sick and had diarrhea as well. I couldn't stop going. It was something I never felt before. I called poison control and they told me I had food poisoning. I know it was Lo-Lo's because for breakfast all I had was coffee and it was now lunch when this happened. I spoke with a manager and she said she would get back to me and never called back. When I called them back they never answered! Horrible customer service! I hope they enjoyed my $30 because I will never spent another dime in this low class restaurant with bad customer service!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excited to get some great chicken and waffles that I hear the reviews speak of. I see several post about bad service but think, oh well I'll see for myself. Walk in, not too busy, greeted with a smile. Seated right away,  looked over menu carefully as a first timer. Made a decision about my drink finally, still no one came. Made a decision about the meal, still no one. Checked out the place, did a little people watching, still no one. Couple came in and  seated several rows from me, waiter brought food to a table close, checked on another table, proceeded to greet and take drink orders for that couple. Immediately upset, got up to walk out as he appeared to make it over to my table finally, unacceptable. No apology, nothing, just stood back and watched me walk away. Dear Sir, travel nurse here that all meals are paid for tax free. I usually order a drink, meal, extra sides, possible second meal for lunch the next day and if I have room a dessert. Why? because I can that's why, afterwards with good service I tip REALLY well. So with that being said, I just took that good old government money to another place of business, THANKS!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A pile of \" Hot Garbage \".   Chicken was dry like it had been in the hot desert sun for a week.  Waffles were under cooked and doughy.  It was called stuffing, but we couldn't eat it, or tell what it really was. The wait staff were very friendly, but slow to come around. The \" good \" reviewers must not get out much. Oh wait . . .  OVER PRICED!  A lot of great restaurants close by, so pass this one on by."}
{"text":"My Cousin swore I would love it. He is full of Sh*t most of the time, so I checked it out. Damn you! You were right - I love this place! 

Got there before the lunch crowd and found seating easily. Started with the sweet tea (Dayum it is good!). Was in Jacksonville not too long ago at a BBQ place and I thought their sweet tea was good, no way - LoLo's has it dialed in! 

Had the LoLo's plate - A (2) waffle, 3 piece of chicken, then I added a side of Grits. Grits came with a square of butter melting on top. I thought it made it sweeter. I thought the grits were a little overcooked, but the butter made them really good! Was able to sample the cornbread... WOW!

The Chicken. Probably the best fried chicken I have ever had in my life! The Waffles - a light sweetness in the batter with a toasty taste. Did I die?
Needless to say, I finished half the waffles, 2 pieces of chicken and the grits and I am good for 24 hours! Satisfaction has been reached! I gotta try the koolaid and the mac and cheese next time. I will be back."}
{"text":"Dear Larry this is david ristick we had my sons 16th birthday day party I love your restaurant your food your service is always five stars !!! we love your whole family we've been friends for years I was there since you open the restaurant Your new GM Maurice made us feel so unwelcome so miserable that it made me feel like I would never want to come there again you know that I drove all away from LA to make my son's birthday party special and  he made us feel so bad that I never want to come back there again if he is working He should be fired!! With all due respect to you your family and your establishment God bless you Larry keep keeping the food coming out good just get rid of this guy ASAP he will ruin your restaurant! He actually said when I told him that I drove from LA  and that I drove 400 miles And he said i \"quote I don't care if you drove 4000 miles! \"What a loser!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles for over 6 years. The service and servers are still great, ESPECIALLY CARL. After all this time - last week was the first time I ordered the Banana Pudding. The presentation sold me alone. Banana Pudding in a mason jar topped with a ridiculous amount of whipped cream! It was delish! There was plenty for 2 to share. I loved the crumbles at the bottom and the sprinkles on top of the whipped cream. No mush! Nice and thick! The wafers and bananas were perfect and sweetened just right. I definitely will make room for dessert again!"}
{"text":"So my friends and I had to roll each other out of the door after this meal was over but it was sooooooooo worth it!!! BEST red kool-aid ever served in jars!! BEST waffles I've EVER had!! BEST red velvet cake I've EVER had!! I also did enjoy their chicken, mac & cheese and collard greens, but none were the best I've ever had, but very good.  I seriously dream about their waffles and red velvet cake, I don't know what magic mix of ingredients make up the waffle batter but it's absolutely perfect and these waffles would stand deliciously on their own even without butter and syrup, but who'd want to do that? the red velvet slice they give you is HUGE and soooo moist, the frostings is cream cheesy delicousness. I can not wait to indulge in this treat again, but since I'm far from being the only one who loves this place, it is always packed and the wait is long, at least on the weekend. Seriously considering taking a day off of work just for a weekday Lo Lo's run =P"}
{"text":"Using Roscoe's as the baseline, I would say they are up there. Need a little work on the waffle but still a place to go. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"So. Good.  Not much like it.  Great staff and great food.  Of course...gotta get the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Lo-lo's is fantastic!  As hard as it might be to believe, fried chicken can be messed up.  Not crunchy enough, too crunchy, not enough seasonin...  Well, they get it perfectly here!  You can pay extra to get all-white meat if you want, but the dark meat is great too.  Waffles are also very good.  They have this slight cinnamon flavor, which is a nice touch.  The mac and cheese, collards, rice/beans, and cornbread are the sides that I tried, and all were amazing.  The decor has these pictures of cute little kids, and the service is really friendly.  An overall enjoyable experience.  Would go back for sure! 

Oh, you can't make reservations, and it can get fairly crowded here (we went on a Saturday for dinner).  So you might have a wait before you get seated."}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix for the week we stopped in to have an inexpensive meal...LOVED IT!!!! The food was great!!!! Great prices!!!!!

When we arrived we were seated in a area where the air conditioning was a blowing on us and we were cold. Casually mentioning this to the server was all we needed. Our server immediately found us another table and was very gracious about the switch!

We had Shrimp and Grits, Chicken, Greens, Corn Bread, Mac and Cheese and Cat Fish...all superb!!!! I can't wait until next time! Keep up the great work! Yummmm!!!"}
{"text":"Catfish, fried chicken, candied yams, cornbread, beans & rice, cheese grits, waffle, sweet tea & lemonade. Every last item the put their foot in it!!!!! For those who don't understand that term, they didn't cut any corners on the food and everything was home cooked."}
{"text":"Love lolos. their waffle are sop delicious. it seems like they have a hint of cinnamon. their brown gravy is to die for. i could literally drink a cup of gravy by itslef. the sweet tea is amazing! service an atmosphere is aways friendly and the establishment is extremely clean. every other menu item is just as delicious."}
{"text":"Meh.... it was okay. Definitely didn't live up to the hype that it receives. 

I had a group of 6 that went for an early afternoon meal and seating took quite a while. It wasn't necessarily the wait itself that bothered us, but we kept getting told that our seat was almost ready even though it was never almost ready.  I finally asked to talk to a manager and we were seated quickly. 

The waitress was very nice, but the food wasn't really anything special at all. A family member sent an order back because it just didn't taste right, and I wasn't impressed with the chicken and waffles meal. Certainly an okay place to grab a bite, but I wouldn't wait for a seat that long again"}
{"text":"Great food and great service, the place was at max capacity on a Monday morning at 10 am if that doesn't tell you everything. Portions are huge and we literally could've ordered half of what we did. I'm just disappointed in myself that I didn't find this place sooner than the first 11 years I have lived out here. Will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"A bit on the pricy side but the chicken is flavorful and tender, sides that you just can't get anywhere and great drinks."}
{"text":"Worst experience with this location ! We sat for 1 hour ordered water our waiter took my Friends water didn't bring it back till about 25 mins .. we waited for our food while 2 other big parties sat after us and got there food before us. . Not once did the waiter check on us .. another couple sitting on another table asked have you 2 not gotten your food? 
Customer service is a zero I will definitely not return to this location ever .. the central location Lolo ' s is the best and awesome customer service all the waiters there are very friendly and on it!!!"}
{"text":"After month's of wanting to try out LoLo's, I finally made it there this past weekend.  I met my sister and some friends there on Sunday morning at 10.  We were seated right away at a giant 6 person table in the front corner of the restaurant, there were only 4 of us, so we had a lot of space, which initially we thought was quite nice, but I think our location lead to the downfall of our experience.

A server came over and took our beverage order almost immediately, she then dropped off our drinks and disappeared.  We then sat for about 10 minutes waiting to have our order taken when a different server came over and asked if we were ready to order.  So I guess the first lady just does the drinks?  I didn't think we were at Flemings!  So we ordered our food and began to wait...and wait...and wait.  The food took forever!  I guess part of the reason we felt this way was because my friend who was with us that had been there before said that the food came out really quick...so we were set up for failure!

When the food arrived, we were missing my friends grits, and it took our server quite awhile to come back and check on us to see how we were doing...so our food was about half gone before we received the grits.  I ordered the Lil Jay plus a leg of chicken.  I have to say the eggs were really good; perfectly fluffy and smothered in cheddar cheese.  I next tried the waffle, which is probably the best waffle that I have ever had.  I am not usually a waffle gal, as I couldn't tell you the last time I had a waffle that wasn't called Eggo, but this was a good waffle.  It was served with plenty of butter and syrup on the side.  Next I tried the chicken, and well, I am just gonna say it....it was just okay.  The coating was pretty thin, and I didn't think it had much flavor, it just tasted like chicken.  I would honestly chose some classic KFC chicken over this chicken any day of the week. 

So to sum it up, the service could be a whole lot better and in my opinion just go for the waffles....although the red velvet cake did look pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"First of all you can't call in your order, then you get here and have to place your order and wait for food. Was told it would be 15 minutes, I'm still here after 45 minutes still no food. I had to ask for an update on food. Not a place I would return to, they are surely not in a hurry to get your food to you.

Not a place I would recommend"}
{"text":"Delicious food, I stop in here 2 to 3 times a month. Friend told me about and I love their food. Prices are fair. I recommend this place, it's awesome!!"}
{"text":"Another spot that I tried out w/a girlfriend prior to our little shopping spree.

The chicken was delicious and the waffles were also good.  I didn't think the waffles were especially phenomenal but together they worked well along w/the syrup.

What I actually enjoyed most was the eggs w/cheese & onions that came w/our meal...they were some of the yummiest eggs I've had in a long time.  I also ordered an extra side of collard greens since I love collard greens and what's eating at a soul food restaurant w/o trying the greens?  I found them to be entirely too sweet & spicy...I couldn't detect any other flavor beside the sweet & spicy and I didn't find them too appetizing.

The staff was friendly and easy-going and we even chatted up our neighbors at the next table."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to places to feel great about myself. I work by the Scottsdale location but have fallen in love with the downtown Phoenix location. The people there are so great and combined with yummy food you can't help but feel good when you leave. I always am tempted by the specials but keep going back to the #8. Try it out if you get a chance. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Unbelievable chicken! Waffles are excellent too. You are gonna live whatever you order at this joint. Live this place and now so does my wife."}
{"text":"Went here a couple times: liked the homemade lemonade, chicken (the best fried chicken i've eaten in Az), catfish (never had eaten catfish this good anywhere), waffles (remind me of waffle house), corn bread, and mac n cheese. Didn't like the gizzards and gravy, but would go back to get the gizzards minus the gravy. Did I mention I am a fat fuck, oh yeah!"}
{"text":"Mind blowing fried chicken great sides and drank what more could you want! The service is outstanding as well.  Sweet jams pumped through speakers is a plus."}
{"text":"I never knew about this place until a co-worker told me. People were lined up out the door it was about a 20 minute wait but so worth it! Being from the south, this place brought a part of home here.  Staff was great, food was awesome!  Chicken tasted like it should. I love the fact they serve your drinks in mason jars! Sweet tea and koolaid I will be coming back! I definitely recommend this place and bring a big appetite."}
{"text":"It took me forever to get served on a slow lunch shift so I moved to the bar after 15 minutes of waiting.  The bartender took another 10 minutes to stop chatting with the waitress and take our order.  The food was bone dry and the waffle was tiny.  I could get twice the value at Boston Market Chicken or Denny's which are both right by here.  This location relies on hype for the original location but fails miserably.  Don't waste your money on this place as it's extremely over-priced and the staff is terrible.  What was with the manager putting her daughters at the bar next to me with coloring books???  I sat at the bar hoping to avoid annoying kids arguing."}
{"text":"You should only venture to Lolo's if you are looking to eat the best fried chicken EVER!  Seriously! I though I though I had died and gone to heaven.  The waffles were also enjoyable as were the grits and mac and cheese but oh man you've got to try this chicken!
 
My friends and I went on a Tuesday night around 5 and walked right in."}
{"text":"MMMMMMMMMMMM Good! The fried chicken here is fantastic.The chicken was thoroughly cooked (doesn't happen every place).

My chicken bread was moist and juicy and some of  the best fried chicken I've ever had. The breading was not too greasy and tasted very good. After i finished my piece, I wanted more!

The waffle served with the chicken is very good! A very nice size and complemented the chicken well. I could do without the the slab of butter, a 1/4 of the butter would do.

The mac and cheese as a side is a definite winner! 

I'm a big fan of the drinks coming in a mason jar.

Service was good.

I think the cost of the food is slightly overpriced. The 1 chicken breast and waffle was $8. A side of mac and cheese was $3.50.  One side item should come with every meal. 

Based on how much I enjoyed the chicken and mac and cheese, I'll be back."}
{"text":"After eating at Roscoes Chicken and Waffles in LA, I was dying to try this place.  This place is different than Roscoes, but definitely would give them a run for their money.  

The location is ok, convenient for the old town crowd.  Nothing special about the building or interior though.  

When the food came out I was pleasantly surprised.  The chicken was nice and crispy and nice and moist on the inside.  The waffles are really what set Lo-Los apart from the rest.  The hints of cinnamon make these waffles special, and left me wanting more after I devoured all of them.   I also ordered a sweet tea, a great offering that every restaurant should have.  

Definitely try this place out if you have not done so already!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I was kind of skeptical at first since I've never tried chicken with waffles but it was a delicious combination of flavors. I had them add whipped cream and strawberries on top of my waffles. Had a jar of sweet tea which for me was the perfect cool sweet beverage needed while taking a break from the Arizona heat. Lastly, the waitress was great. She had a friendly personality and she made the experience much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Mrs. Whites, and this is a chip off the ol' block, but with a twist. The fried chicken is tender and juicy inside while perfectly crispy on the outside. Great flavor as well, and not dripping with grease. The green beans are perfection! Perfectly cooked, seasoned, and had a slight kick (heat) to them. The mac and cheese was also delicious. The corn bread muffin was moist, buttery and flavorful. I was so full, but had to try the red velvet, and so glad I did. The cake is so moist and the frosting is perfect; not overly sweet. The only thing to be aware of is that bits of the red cake get stuck between teeth. Looks like those red pills you use to check if you're brushing your teeth correctly (epic fail). I'm just glad I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and noticed my red teeth before heading out to the next event. So,note to self,  don't take pictures after eating the cake and be cautious if you're on a first date. If he or she is giggling while looking at you, it's not because you're funny (well, your are, but not for the reasons you think). Service was alright, considering how busy it was. 

The HUGE negative is that I came on a Saturday and the ENTIRE parking lot (mind you it's really small) is valet. So, you're paying additional money to eat here on the weekend. You could choose to park along the street or in front of someone's home, but  I'm not sure how safe the area is. It's so busy on the weekend parking is limited. We got there around 10:30am and parked  close by and waited about 15 minutes for a table. There's a very small waiting area inside. Most people had to wait outside, which was fine since the weather is nice. But in the summer and winter, this could be an issue. Was it worth it?  Ohhhh, yeah!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast on a Sunday morning and it was busy, but they seem to know their business well because our food was out within 5 minutes of ordering and tasted fresh.  I come here for the chicken and that did not disappoint.  It was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  The waffles seemed a little overdone, so I ended up eating only half of it.  I had some mac and cheese which was great, so that made up for the waffle.  

The service was prompt and attentive, so no problems there.  However, I don't agree with the 18% gratuity for a group of 5 people, but I'm guessing it's to ensure people tip.  Since the service was great I have no problem paying 18%, but I would prefer that the amount to tip be my decision for a group of less than 7 or 8."}
{"text":"My wife & I went here for breakfast last week while on vacation and it was a good experience. We both ordered a chicken breast & a waffle because we had to try the classics. I've had chicken & waffles before but it was a long time ago at rosco's in long beach, ca. In any case:

- service was great (we got there when the place opened, there weren't that many people in there...yet)
- the chicken was very good. 
- the waffle was 'meh'.
- the cheesy grits were good.

all-in-all i'd go back and recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Most horrible customer service ever.....food ehhh.... What is so great about greasy fried chicken."}
{"text":"Every once in a while, you just need to enjoy good southern cooking.

I was taken to Lo-lo's while visiting Phoenix.

The Sweet Tea is served in a mason jar and comes with a diabetic attack. I had the Betty Bop - fried chicken breast and waffle. The waffle was really the stand out portion of the meal, but the two did work together.

You don't have to get the chicken and waffle combo. But come on, don't be like that.

We went Friday before lunch, and we were sitting and eating in 10 minutes, but from the looks of the other reviews, that isn't normal."}
{"text":"I love to come here! I come here at least twice a month. The food is great along with the staff. My usual is the \"Baby Ray.\" 3 pieces of juicy fried chicken smothered in gravy and onions with 2 waffles. Everything tastes homemade and on point! This is one of my favorite spots for lunch!"}
{"text":"Everyone said I had to try this places so I did. I went in and the waitress was nice. I was getting this to go but ended up eating out in the car. Didn't want it to get cold before I got home. Anyways. I ordered the boob(A breast and a waffle) and a side of mac n cheese as well as a to go fruit punch kool aid. I'm not sure why but she gave me the drink free. I think she was having issues with the register. She said it would be a 30 min wait. I thought that was long for only a handful of tables. So I took a seat and waited. It came out in 12 mins. So I went out side and ate it in my car. The chicken had really good flavors and was juicy. But it was a bit too salty. I'm not sensitive to salt and that was too much for me. The waffle taste like a waffle. It had a bit of cinnamon which I liked. But the waffle had no crunch at all. It came completely soft. I was looking forward to the crunch. That's why I ate it there and didn't wait to get it home. The Mac n cheese was good. Not great. It wasn't as creamy as I thought or wanted it to be. It was kind of thick. The kool aid tasted bad. I was looking forward to it too. It tast like the artificial sweetner mixed with those little squeeze flavor things that you put in water. Over all it wasn't that bad. I want to give it one more try. Maybe it was an off day."}
{"text":"If you like fried chicken and waffles, this is the place for you. Very tasty fried chicken. Drinks are served in jars. Only complaint is that they don't like to split the check."}
{"text":"Not a fan. It was a nice atmosphere and the service was ok considering they seemed short staffed. The food was just not good. The chicken was very dry and seemed over cooked. The waffles were ok though. The biscuits and gravy was alright but lacked anything amazing. The house cocktail (forgot the name) also was just really sweet. Also you'll get a heart attack eating most of this food. Seemed more like a chain restaurant than a local place. I don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Lo Los chicken and waffles, I have been to your when it was a  side driveway. And it was everything so good that this was something for me to base my decision on moving from NY where we have some of the top soul food restaurants where the owners (yes Gladys, LL Cool J ) and other famous people would stop through to say \"what's up\" ok so 3yrs later I moved here. Revised LoLos to fins it nothing like the first time around. Then my husband and I checked out the one in Scottsdale, the food was good but the Greeter was very nasty. I guess because the way my husband and I were dressed they thought we were bums. Okay so today I decided to revisit  the Central Ave location and it Sucked, I wish I can show you the pic the only fresh on my was the chicken wing, the corn bread was dried out and overcooked,  the breast looked like it was cooked in old grease, and the breast looked old. The sides were okay but this is just the reason why I would never return.  The worst food ever!!!##"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of great things about this place so I decided to try it out with my gf.. I can't complain about the food .. it was excellent.. the service however was HORRIBLE! We were told to wait for 15 minutes when there was clearly seating available.. when we were finally seated, we were asked for our drinks and 15 min later a different waiter feels bad and asks us if we had ordered our drinks.. by then our waitress had noticed she had totally forgot about us and finally brought us our drinks. My gf had originally ordered a sweet tea and received an unsweetened one.( we didn't say anything)"}
{"text":"I really like this place!  The valet parking was a neat touch.  If the prices on the kool-aid and sides were just  a $1.25 cheaper, I would have given it 5 star.  Great staff!!!"}
{"text":"So, I had #10: Tre-Tre - 2 drumsticks & waffle with a side of Fries. First let me say I been to the one In Phoenix a few times and this was my first time at the Scottsdale location and the Phoenix location I was not impressed at all you could tell the oil needed to be changed each time I went. Now on to the Scottsdale location, I was Very impressed food came out hot good flavor fresh. The atmosphere was nice, The service was just ok took them awhile to take our order and come back for refills but over all it was a good meal."}
{"text":"Left Lolo's in Scottsdale at 10:15am. Did not eat there because the service upon entering was terrible. There were two parties waiting at hostess stand but no hostess. There was a young woman cleaning a booth whom I presume was \"the hostess.\"  She turned and saw us but did not acknowledge us. After several minutes another worker brought out a high chair for the baby in one of the waiting parties. Apparently they had to locate it from the back. After several more minutes \"the hostess\"seated the other waiting party in the booth she had just cleaned, although there were several empty booths, without ever asking their table or booth preference. The party asked to be reseated at one of several empty tables and was reseated. The woman finally asked if our party size then turned to do other things. At that point we left, convinced that the rest of the experience would be equally disappointing. There were only about ten to fifteen customers in the restaurant so no reason for the poor customer service.  It seems the business simply does not care about basic customer service. Not sure whether the food is good or not and we'll never know because we will not return. We promptly went to a competitor's restaurant where we were promptly greeted, waited only about ten minutes for a table despite their full house had a very enjoyable meal.  Lolo's owner should invest some resources in training his staff in customer service 101."}
{"text":"The worst location I have ever been to I couldn't really eat my food due to fruit flies flying all on it and to top it off the manager was a complete idiot refused to do anything about it"}
{"text":"Downtown location has been renovated.  It's gorgeous and roomy but definately seems to have been \"Scottsdale-a-fried\" (get it?); it just doesnt' seem right that LoLo's downtown location has \"Valet parking.\" 

Since this is an update to my original review, I want to call out that I have a new menu favorite:  Stupid Fries -Hot seasoned fries topped with tender fried white meat chicken, gravy & onions, green & red bell peppers covered w/ cheese.  YMTS(f).
You
MUST
Try
Stupid fries

Also - if it's a slow day, ask your waiter if the Chef will make you a Chicken Waffle Martini - if the stars are aligned, you will be rewarded with the most unique and delicious martini you have ever tasted."}
{"text":"I had the best breakfast ever at Lo-Lo's. My husband heard about this place from one of his friends and we just had to check it out while we were in Phoenix from Virginia for a wedding. We are so glad we did, the food is A-m-a-z-i-n-g and the service is just as wonderful!  The waffles were some of the best I have ever had at a restaurant and the chicken was done just right! Yum! :) I wish we had better places like this in our area. We hope to eat here again next time we are in Phoenix! :)"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that LoLo's has probably the best fried chicken I've ever tasted in my life. Even if I weren't hungry walking in, I'd probably still be able to scarf down plenty of their chicken. That being said, I wish the waffles were just as good, but they tasted rather disappointing in comparison. Maybe it's just because the chicken is so good, who knows. Having Kool-Aid on the menu (several flavors, at that) is definitely awesome; honestly, you don't find that anywhere else.
One of the major gripes I have with LoLo's is the service... I've been there 4 times before, and only once have I actually been asked for my order without me flagging down a waiter. Each visit was during busy times, but it was still rather obnoxious, considering it has been a repetitive issue. But, I feel like the food was able to at least save them from my complete angry wrath. If you're looking for good food, LoLo's is definitely a great stop."}
{"text":"I went there once and really can't wait to go back again. Great food and great service. Very fun just to be there and delicious. I forgot what their special name was for it, but I had the one with a waffle and two chicken legs. I was very satisfied, paid the fair price and left feeling like I could win the day. It's not dirt cheap (the way I like it), but definitely fair. It's the kind of food that energizes rather than exhausts you after eating it. They do a great job!"}
{"text":"Chicken was fun. I love chicken. I tried their number 2. A peppery sauce. I didn't like their biscuit and gravy. Biscuit was more sweet than buttery. Service was great."}
{"text":"Walked in at a good time, 30min after opening so there were plenty of places to sit.  Ordered a betty boop and coffee.  Staff was courteous and service was quick.  However, I only got my original coffee and was never asked for a refill.  

To the reviews saying the red rooster sauce is spicy or even tasty for that matter, \"what's up with that? /snl\"  It's of the same ilk as a frank's hot sauce, but with even less presence.    

Chicken and waffle was good - nothing life changing or worth writing home about.  There's no exotic spices/combos to speak of, you're basically just paying for the novelty of having chicken & waffles on the same plate whenever you damn well please.

3 stars because to me soul food should be more than just breading chicken and throwing it into a fryer.  I'd give it 4 stars for the novelty, but Tuck Shop has a chicken&waffle plate that is in another class, albeit pricier."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since high school and this is THE spot in Phoenix for Chicken & Waffles. You have to go to the one downtown. I went to the Scottsdale location and it just wasn't the same. The original downtown location is in this old house, which is very cozy and inviting whereas the Scottsdale location is a huge space in a strip mall (though I heard they're moving locations?) where they are pumping out meals so I don't think the food is quite as good (it does comes out faster).

The fried chicken is crispy and delicious and the waffles are large thin but still have that crunch. The sides are also pretty good, especially the mac n cheese, but I usually don't have room for much more than the chicken and waffles. I go with the Lo-Lo's- 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles. Great sugary drinks in mason jars--sweet tea, lemonade, kool aid. Mmmm haven't been to Lo-Los in a while, just writing this makes me want to go back."}
{"text":"This is a must stop when I come to Phoenix the best  fried chicken and waffles!!!! The staff is always great and friendly from the host to the server and even the busser"}
{"text":"I just had lunch there. It was decent but honestly I'm not sure where all of the top notch ratings are coming from. The chicken was good, and the waffles were good, but not \"oh my god, I HAVE to come back good\". I probably wouldn't even consider taking my out of town friends here. I'll have to try Stacy's or Mrs.Whites."}
{"text":"I side with many other reviewers...the food is very good but the service is terrible. I waited nearly 15 minutes for my order, which was chicken fried chicken. After I saw 5 people who were behind me get their food I asked what the delay was. The counter person - who took my order - said \" Didn't they tell you that takes longer?\" I'm still trying to figure out who \"they\" are since she was standing in front of me when I ordered. Also, no ice in dispenser at 10:30am. The counter person said, \"Is it empty?\" Obvious answer, it was never filled yet today even though they had been open for hours. Same thing with silverware, it was a shock to her that the dispensers were all empty. 

The food did save the day - it was excellent which made up for the 1 star service. Way above average for airport food. 5 stars food + 1 star service/2 = 3 stars."}
{"text":"New location is really nice . When my friend and I walked in we weren't greeted nicely by the hostess . We were seated and the waitress was very polite . I went to use the bathroom and there we're paper towels everywhere . It looked as if it had been neglected for a couple of hours . I used the restroom and came out and say back down. A lady that worked there walked up to me and told me that she noticed my boots from the other stall and that she picked up my paper towels that I had thrown down on the floor ! I was shocked first of all that while enjoying my dinner she would walk up and accuse me of being disgusting lazy and trifling . No she wasn't my server and no she didn't have to go out of her way to say anything to me especially if she didn't see me do any of that but just happened to see my boots while she was popping a squat . It made me mad and uncomfortable . Everyone else was very professional & attentive . My food was ok my chicken salad came out with ONE chicken strip on it ! Then they brought more chicken over that was very over cooked .I don't know if I'll return."}
{"text":"One thing I miss most about moving to Phoenix from LA is the food choices. So as you can imagine, I was beyond excited to find a chicken and waffle joint in Phoenix that easily compares to Roscoes. In fact, I'm not sure I could tell you who's better at this point. 

I always order the Betty Boop. Great waffle. Good chicken (make sure you try maple syrup on the chicken...weird but delicious). 

Random note, Love the building remodel. Once you enter the building you almost forget what part of town you're in. In fact, my sister loves the ladies room. She believes the lighting in there makes her look like a rockstar and gives her an instant boost to her self esteem. So go ahead and order that side of cheese grits swimming in butter...just be sure to visit the ladies room on your way out and leave feeling like a million bucks!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best damn chicken and waffles spot, period. Living in Southern California there are plenty of places to get fried chicken, and many of them have waffles included, but the only one worth going to is Roscoe's, which is a must for anyone visiting SoCal. 

However, the first time I tried Lo-Lo's, my mind was fuckin' blown away. They literally blow Roscoe's out of the water. I have NEVER had a bad experience with the service or the food at Lo-Lo's and if I could, I would eat that shit EVERY fuckin day! The chicken is so juicy and so tender while the outside is crispy and not flaky or drowning in oil like at so many other fried chicken joints. Their mac-n-cheese was also mouth watering with the globs of cheese they cover it in and their biscuits that were drowning is sausage gravy are as soft and fluffy as Charmin. 

That being said, the absolute BEST part that won me over and is literally making me want to visit Arizona at least once a month JUST to eat at Lo-Lo's was their gat damn grape Kool-Aid!! Holy mother of all things delicious!! This shit was the perfect combination of Kool-Aid, sugar, and ice cubes. I seriously wanted to buy a gallon of this stuff to take back home. If it's a hot summer day and you're thirsty as fuck then this shit will quench your thirst like it's the first time you've ever had liquid in your body. Don't think about visiting this joint just fuckin' do it and thank me later."}
{"text":"So good!  I've heard so much about this place and finally made it.  It might not be health food, but it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Mercy me, this place is deep-fried Heaven! We had very friendly service, the place was very clean, and sweet tea in a mason jar?? Perfection. Husband and I got your standard chicken and waffles, and added collard greens and (to die for) mac n' cheese. It was all superb. The greens were tender, not too bitter, not too salty, and the chicken was crisp, flavorful, and very high quality. Not too fatty, or greasy. Not to mention, as an interracial couple, we felt very at home here, no gawkers for a change lol, Must have been half the couples were of mixed ethnicity, and nobody asked to touch my daughter's hair, love it!"}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service is terrible.

40 mins to get seated, which was fine.  However once seated, almost 10 minutes before anyone greeted us.  Then 20 minutes for us to finally get our drinks.  Even when the food was served, we had to wait another 10 minutes before we got any napkins or silverware.

Chicken is good but the service drops the ratings on this place drastically."}
{"text":"Gotta say VERY disappointed! Been going here for years BEFORE they got big headed. Tried to go today after dbacks game.......VALET parking only on LOT??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! THEN go in to get something \"TO GO\" and get the ole...sorry we aren't doing Togo orders, our kitchen is too backed up.. WTF.....Guess they are doing so well they don't give a F**K anymore....WILL NOT BE BACK! But I know they don't care..."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but what's better after a night out in old town than fried chicken?

I'm not a big gravy person, but it tasted great with the chicken and waffles.  We also got the red velvet cake to go and it was quite good.  Very moist!

I want to try some other things here too, but how can you not order their signature chicken and waffles every time?"}
{"text":"Great place to chillax!  The food was great, very tasty and made to perfection! Service was great.  Sheree was our greeter and our waitress. She was absolutely amazing! She definitely made our experience great! When you go there try to get her as your waitress. And Sheree 3rd time is always a charm, good luck!"}
{"text":"Megan, our server, was friendly,  prompt, and very helpful! 
We had the Fried chicken gizzards - tender inside, crispy outside and not at all gamey tasting.
I also highly recommend the chicken fried chicken (the gravy is tasty) and collared greens (nice balance of sweet and bitter).
The fried chicken was good (crispy batter and juicy meat). My only reason for knocking down a star is that the waffle was not as crisp and was a bit thin. 
Portions were huge but prices are not. See pics."}
{"text":"Always busy, and for good reason. The food is truly delicious comfort food. They have kool-aid!!! What?! The staff is always smiling and moves quick. Since discovering it, I will go no where else for my breakfast food (the grits are amazing)"}
{"text":"Moved here from Alabama and frequently visited GA, mostly Atalanta. Was craving some chicken and waffles. Was told to go to the central location. 

The waffles are ok, they're good, but a little soggy. The chicken was burnt... I am used to the golden, crisp, \"light and fluffy\", chicken, but this chicken was thick, a lot of fat, and was very greasy. I understand how fried chicken is made, but this chicken was heavy and very very greasy. Ordered banana pudding, I was looking forward to it, but it wasn't that great. 

The location was very busy, I am to assume that was a factor with the food results and how poorly it was made. The staff was somewhat helpful, our waitress was called into work to cover a no-show. It was obvious she wasn't pleased about it. That too may have played a part in our food, however, I have been there again and same results. 

The food is decent, may visit again, but depends on whether I am near central and buckeye, which is rare that I am in that area."}
{"text":"Man, Lolo's makes some great food. I zealously ordered way too much (and ate every bite). I had the #10 - the Tre Tre - two legs and a waffle, with a side of smothered potatoes. When I asked what the potatoes were smothered with I got quite a look from the waiter. (\"What a white girl,\" he probably thought.)

I got over my original white-girl fear and smeared plenty of hot sauce on my chicken then dipped that goodness into the syrup and wrapped it all in a bit of waffle. Oh yeah, it hit the spot!

My friends all had similar items, but different sides. The collards are true southern greens, the fried okra is perfect and the beans on rice has great flavor. This is the mother of all weekend breakfast/brunch meals. Delight in its glory!"}
{"text":"The getting seated was fast today but the tickets times on the food is horrible. I would say the front of the restaurant is dialed in... The back of the house is obviously having issues.

Our waitress Tatiana truly made efforts to save the day with offering a waffle and bringing out son his food while kitchen does whatever the they do. These two stars are because of her!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I visited Lo-Lo's and compared to Roscoe in Long Beach, the chicken and waffles were alot tastier.  The fried chicken was moist and not gresy.  The service was friendly and efficient.  The collard greens were also delicious."}
{"text":"No, no on LoLo's!  

Yowsa, after wanting to try chicken and waffles for a long time, Lolo's was an incredibly bad experience.  Food, service and business practices all need SERIOUS help.

We arrived to a 1/4 full (at best) restaurant.   Staff seemed friendly enough but once our order was taken the whole experience went down hill fast.  One of our four entrees was not delivered with the rest (by a server other that the one who took our order).  It was several minutes until we could get the attention of our waitress.  She said she would look into it.  A few minutes later she returned to inform us that the kitchen said our food had all been delivered.  Cleary that was not the case we explained since one of us was sitting there with no food.  Off she went to the kitchen again.  She returned to inform us that since it was closing time (4 PM) they were now out of white meat chicken, and corn, but that she could bring us some left over chicken legs to make up for it.  How a chicken and waffles restaurant runs out of chicken and corn is beyond me....likely they simply didn't want to make any more to correct their error.  Since 3 of our party were now 1/2 way through our entrees, we said fine bring out what you can.  She delivered 3 cold legs and told us that the missing entree would be removed from the bill, along with 2 of our drinks.

The food was a total flop.  Waffles were on the cold side and not terribly good.  The chicken had obviously been sitting in a warming tray for at least a few hours...maybe longer.  Not a good thing with fried chicken.  The mac and cheese was decent enough and the syrup was good.  Small victories come hard at Lolo's.

When we were presented with the bill, we were surprised to find that nothing had been deducted.  After struggling again to find our waitress, she assured us that one entree had been deducted along with the drinks.  Frankly were we in a hurry for a family engagement and should have pressed the issue.  Instead we paid the bill and left.  Hours later, in examining the receipt, we added up the bill manually only to find that NOTHING had been deducted.  NOTHING!  In addition, an automatic gratuity of nearly 20% had been added....for 4 adults and two toddlers (who ate off of our adult entrees).

To summarize:  Avoid, avoid, avoid Lolo's!  Frankly even Waffle House puts this place to shame, and trust me, I'm no fan of Waffle House.  Unless you relish spending your money on lousy food, lousy service, and highly questionable business practices there are TONS of other great places to eat in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"loving the chicken. loving the waffles. loving the grits. loving the trough of tea.  lo lo's has it all!  apparently yesterday got a bit insane, but for sunday (today), they've brought in extra help.  super nice staff, super tasty food.  kid friendly.  i don't know what's in the waffles that makes them so good, i don't know what's in the chicken breading that makes it so good.  i don't care!  it was tasty as all get out, and luckily, it's within walking distance from us!  hopefully, this can help our area get some more foot traffic, and also help some of the lovely other eateries in the area (like the noodle ranch).  

yum!!!"}

Place was dirty inside, sticky menus, flies everywhere, crumbs all over chairs and floor. Our waitress was nice, however it took 55 minutes to get our food after ordering. Then they forgot to bring a side and after asking the waitress for it, it took about 10 minutes to get the forgotten side. The entire visit was at least an hour and a half for a family of 4, which is way too long for chicken & waffles. I do love Lolos, I'll just be going to the Scottsdale location from now on."}

{"text":"first time going to LoLo's.  will definitely be going back.  since we'd never been there before, spoke with patron at table next to us, explaining it was our first visit, and asked what he would suggest we order.  since there were two of us, he suggested ordering the #3 and then getting a couple of side items.  we did order the #3 to split and then ordered mac & cheese, smothered potatoes and grits.  great way to sample a few of their offerings.  left definitely feeling satisfied.  thank you kind sir for your suggestion."}
{"text":"Everything was DELICIOUS!! Employes are all soo nice! Very enjoyable place to eat and cool building."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just biased and like the Phoenix location better, but I've had better Lolo's at the Phoenix location. Plus, I love the cozy atmosphere there as well.  

We came in around 11:15am before the rush and were seated right away.  A friend and I decided to split the KK, thinking the chicken was the same size, but we were wrong.  The chicken pieces were a lot smaller and it didn't have the same flavor that I was expecting.  5 minutes into our meal, one of the waitresses came by and asked us if she could take our plates.  We all just looked at each other and was wondering if she was kidding since we all had full plates.  She came back more often to clear our plates than to refill our drinks! I know the place was busy but being rushed through our meal is the most annoying thing a waitress can do! On top of that, it took forever to get our check and refills.  

Knowing that they have THE best Red Velvet cake ever, I decided to take one to go.  After taking a few bites, I discovered egg shells in the cake...  I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"down home food!!!! a great atmosphere,  great staff, love love love love love love love love love the sweet tea and banana pudding and everything on the menu"}
{"text":"I visited Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles for the 1st time this past weekend. Thankfully I was meeting a few locals that knew to call in ahead to make a reservation, otherwise we would have had to wait a long while for a table. Though the restaurant is quite small, rather a \"whole-in-the-wall\" type of joint, I have to say the service was pretty excellent. The food servers were quick and to the point, no wasting time kind of service. I was in a party of 20 and our food orders came out within a few minutes and they are generous with their portions. I personally ordered the \"Tre-Tre\" (2 drumsticks and 1 waffle) and added a side order of 2 eggs scrambled and a side order of corn bread. The menu prices are inexpensive too! Major Plus! Just be sure to bring cash if you are in a large party because they will only be able to split the bill into 2 seperate checks."}
{"text":"Stopped by to pick up a few pieces and a side or two for my wife staying with our hospitalized child and was flat out refused service by the contemptuous, smiling front of house staff.
I was informed they were too busy to be bothered with a small take out order and if I'd like to wait for a seat to open up they would accomodate me in good time.
My inlaws had a similar experince a while back. 
KFC has no such exclusivity. Henceforth, that's where I'll be getting my chicken fix. As for the waffles, guess I'll have to make my own. 
I plan to inform my coworkers at the downtown office of the indifferent treatment I received.
I wouldn't set foot in this establishment again, even if I had the runs and they had the last roll of TP.   
                                                         LO LO's is NO NO!!!"}
{"text":"It was my boyfriend and I's first time here. We always here people talking about how great it is so wanted to give it a shot. 

Our waitress Danielle is what made the experience honestly. She gave great recommendations and helped us choose what to get and actually gave us her honest opinion of the food. 

I got the sausage gravy with eggs and potatoes, my boyfriend had the three piece chicken and waffle meal and we shared an Oreo pancake. Oh! And their sweet tea and kool-aid is where its at! 

My gravy came out cold as well as my potatoes. Since I'm in the service industry I hate complaining but its bs that my food was cold so I asked her to just heat the gravy back up and id deal with the rest. I was too hungry to wait for my food to be re cooked. So, she came back with the gravy (still not even hot) BUT about two minutes later Danielle brings me fresh steaming hot potatoes without me even asking for them. NOW THATS SERVICE. The chicken my boyfriend demolished and the waffles were frekking awesome. Not to mention that Oreo pancake alone I will come back for. 

Idk If the kitchen was in the weeds or if my plate had just been sitting in the window or what but sending out cold food is the worst thing in my opinion. 

Will be back to sit in Danielle's section, for sure. Kuddos to you! :)"}
{"text":"Returned to Lo-Lo's downtown with some other friends who had never been.  My friend Trish makes her own soul food so I was curious what she would think.  The verdict:  we all agreed the chicken was great, the waffles, too, but the greens just don't match up to hers.  I had cheese grits for the first time and liked them a lot.  Also, took Trish's cue and ordered red cool-aid.  Loved it!  Never been a big fan before, but it just worked with the rest of the food.  It is served in big mason jars.  Lo- Lo's remains a fave of mine."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what I just ate but it most definitely wasn't a waffle. It was more like a flat soggy checkered pancake. Not fluffy at all and very bland. I've tasted better waffles out of a box in my freezer."}
{"text":"Since I didn't get my eggos this morning, and the reviews on Yelp were rather high, I convinced my daughter we should try out LoLo's today. She's never been there, and wanted to try them out too,so it was an easy sell.  Going in, the place was kinda small, but I've been in even smaller joints. I ordered 2 thighs and a waffle, and my daughter had 2 wings with a waffle. The chicken was cooked to perfection and the waffle was light and fluffy with a great touch of cinnamon. I didn't think I was gonna finish the whole meal (cause I wanted to bring some home) but the task was too easy. If you like really SWEET tea , this is the place to get it. Mine was a bit too sweet for my liking (thats why they only get 4stars, because of the iced tea).  Overall if you never been here, you gotta go. At least once, then twice, then three times....."}
{"text":"Being from the Mid West I have always heard about chicken and waffles and never had the chance to experience it. Until now. Convinced our party to give it a try and we were glad we did. 

We were seated promptly and our \"drank\" orders were taken very promptly. Of course I got the number 9 and mac and cheese because its not optional. Crispy crunchy chicken and waffles and warm syrup is all I could have imagined and more. Probably the best waffles I have ever had in my life. It would be worth going just for the waffles. The chicken however didn't have much spice or flavor in the breading which was sad since it was cooked beautifully."}
{"text":"Omfg this place is AMAZING!! I will absolutely be a return customer. Had the tre tre's it was delicious. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Newly remodeled so there is more seating available.  Excellent fried chicken and waffles.  Serves all drinks in giant mason jars.  Excellent service.  Soul food establishment."}
{"text":"I LOVE Lo-Lo's. The food is phenomenal (I always get #3, the classic Lo-Lo's with 2 waffles and 3 pieces of chicken) and the staff is fun and friendly. The decor is awesome, gives you such a southern homey feel. I love the mason jars as well, makes the soul food vibe so much more authentic. The music is upbeat and you really just wanna dance and eat. Really in my top 5 of food places. Love it."}
{"text":"The food:

Finally, the saving grace that could make me return to this place. Or so I had hoped. Here's what the two of us ended up ordering (text from their website):

-Lolo's Famous SoulFood Platter - 3 pieces of Chicken Southern Fried (got three thighs) w/ 2 side orders & cornbread. For the two sides, we got Cheesy Grits and Mac n Cheese.
== The thighs were okay, definitely juicy but lacking in flavor. the chicken tasted bland, and 1 of these thighs were so bloody at the bone the meat around it tasted like iron. The skin was nice and crisp, but all I could taste was ?? flavor, aka salt, pepper, and either 5spice and msg or just msg. Not necessarily bad, but not what I expected from a 'southern soul food' place. The Mac n Cheese was super cheesy and not bad, but not why I chose Lolo's for lunch. Cheesy Grits got a scoop of butter on top. why? Cornbread was dry and had a decent muffintop/honeyglaze and also came with a scoop of butter on top. 

-#1 - 3pc chix southern style, 2 waffles, grits & 2 eggs with cheese & onions
== Sam Yu's food; I didn't taste this as it was nearly the same as my orders. Honestly we didn't share much. 

-#3 - 3px chix (thigh, leg, and wing) prepared southern style, with 2 golden waffles
== This thigh was also bloody. Ate around it. The leg was abnormally large, looked like it was frenched rib, and was terribly dry. The wing was actually juicier than the drumstick. Strange but true. So the chicken wasn't fantastic here, but it was definitely expensive. at $2.50 per piece I would definitely not come back for their chicken. Would their waffles be able to pull a last minute win for them? Unfortunately the waffles I received were as dry as Arizona's summer desserts. I couldn't eat it alone, or with some of the butter I had transplanted from my cornbread and the scoop from my grits. I noticed at this point my cousin's waffles came with syrup. Since I was being a stubborn child I didn't request some syrup and just left their waffles to be that bad. dry, hard, and nothing special.

-South Side Chili Cheese Fries - Hot fries topped with our homemade chili & cheese
== My cousin's, and after all the stuff I had tried, I didn't both trying this.

-Grape Koolaid
== Wow that's sweet. I let the ice melt a good amount before drinking it in order to let the water dilute the Koolaid. Novelty mason jar, but wayyyyy sweet.

-Lemonade
== My cousin also reported a great disturbance in his blood-sugar levels after drinking this.

Instant regret. Ordered way too much food for the two of us, but for me that meant leftovers I could give to the dog or myself later. Sadly I probably won't be returning here on my own volition, unless it's to accompany somebody else / give it a measly second chance. Maybe my expectations were set too high, maybe I've been spoiled by Crispy Fried Chicken in San Diego, or maybe I'm just too damn critical about food. Regardless, I do not recommend spending your money or time at Lolo's. Making your own is much cheaper and will taste so much better."}
{"text":"I have passed this place so many times, and thought it sounded gross. But I went there yesterday and LOVED it. The waffles were good. And the Red Velvet cake was so amazing. Definitely one of my favorite red velvet cakes. 


I haven't tried any chicken, but I bet it's good."}
{"text":"Great Place! Went out here for breakfast and was greeted by the delicious aromas as soon as I walked in the door. I ordered the Soul Food Plater and boy was it good. The chicken had great flavor and was nice and crispy, the corn was sweet and delicious and the macaroni and cheese was deliciously cheese. In not too many words this place is delicious and worth traveling down south for. The Kool Aid was a bit overly sweet but overall A+."}
{"text":"It has become a Spring Training tradition to go to Lo-Lo's before heading down the street to Scottsdale Stadium to watch the Giants play. Been here twice now, once on a weekday and once on a weekend, and during the weekday you can walk right in and get a table but on the weekends be sure to expect a bit of a wait. 

Quality and flavor of food is really good. I'm very impressed by the batter of their waffles, I love the hint of cinnamon complemented by the delicious warm syrup. The fried chicken isn't necessarily the best I 've ever tried but it's still good. The menu offers a variety of options to have these two dishes plus one of their sides. Not a big fan of their mac and cheese or any of their other sides really. But I do like their cornbread a lot. My favorite part of this establishment though is the kool-aid on tap served in mason jars with the option to take some to-go. A very unique touch and also very nostalgic all at the same time.


Staff is really nice, price is decent, definitely worth trying if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Best chicken and waffles I have ever eaten.  The waffles are better than any desert I have had at a \"fancy\" restaurant.  And the fried chicken is simply the best - hands down!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, but the worst service I've ever had. 65 minutes to get 5 orders of chicken and waffles and a catfish sandwich. Awful."}
{"text":"Awesome fried chicken and good service. Prices are reasonable. Will comeback!"}
{"text":"VERY Expensive but oh so good! Big portions best greens, cornbread, red beans and rice, smothered gravy, chicken strips EVER! The blue Kool-Aide is GREAT!"}
{"text":"It's very unfortunate. New location is nice. Enjoy the drinks and atmosphere. However it took 15 minutes at the bar before a drink order even started. Two drinks later or 30 minutes and still no appetizers. The service is slow slow slow. They are way understaffed. It's not the staffs fault that service sucks it the management. Absolutely pathetic. Ohhhh and the parking is a joke. Plan on parking a block away because the hotel next door takes all the parking. I will NOT return. I will miss it but will Not be back."}
{"text":"The chicken here is amazing! Can't say the same about the service we got. First our server forgot about us so we were sitting for 30 min with no service on top of the 1 1/2 hrs that we had to wait to get a table. Our water was never refilled and when we paid she kept the change assuming it was her tip (when it wasn't bc tip was already included). For those reasons we will never be back at this establishment. There are many other places we can go for some chicken waffles"}
{"text":"I cannot begin to say how much I loved my first trip to Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles...  there was so much on the menu I can't wait for my next visit.  I totally recommend  it.  Love the ice tea!!! The Waffles melt in your mouth.  And the Chicken was soooooooooooo good!"}
{"text":"First time eating here I'm debating on if I will return. I am a bit disappointed because I wanted to enjoy this restaurant! As soon as we walked in it took about 3 minutes to be acknowledge before being sited. Our waiter Nathan provided great customer service. I ordered a number 7 which includes 2 dry and cold pieces of chicken wings and a delicious waffle with a side of grits. Maybe my next visits will be better."}
{"text":"Great great great
Brought some back with on the plane. Great service, great ambience, great food. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service, great food, great music, clean! Yes they deserve more than 5 stars. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"My experience was terrible!. Waited over 45 minutes for a table when there were 3 tables and 2 booths available...Waited over 25 minutes for our food. Our waiter said its because they are training their new expiditor...on a Sunday??? Are you kidding me!! Another 8 minutes and said the manager would be out to apologize for this....5 more minutes and NO one came out nor do we have our food. Left the restuarant...manager stopped us outside to explain..both of his kitchen managers had left..he couldn't find them. Apologized for our wait...continued to tell us his problems...No thank you!!! Do not visit this restaurant if you want to eat in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Should be called Slo Lo's...waited 45 mn for the table...now have waited an hr for my food....I'm so not liking the service so far and havent even tasted the food. We're new to Arizona (a month) Everyone says go to Lolo's....So while doing my review ...the food comes....it was just OK.....I've had better...or maybe it was the wait that turned my taste buds....Nice looking place...not worth the 2hr wait...."}
{"text":"I normally LOVE Lolo's but today my experience was less than great. Our party of nine arrived at Lolo's at 11:30 am only to be seated at 1pm. I understand that the seating is limited and there is little room inside the resturant, but what I didnt understand is why five parties that arrived after us, got seated before us. 

Once inside we ordered and got our food in great time. The chicken, waffles, and mac n cheese were amazing! However, while trying to serve us in a quick manner, our french fries were old, cold, and dry. We ate with no complain (I mean after waiting for an hour and a half we were HUNGRY!) and had a good laugh with Carlos, one of our servers.

As we were getting ready to leave and pay the bill, the staff became rude. One man told us he couldnt have a crowd of 80 trying to pay at the same time. He sent us back to our table to have someone come and help us. After that they told us they could only split the bill in two, which meant that none of us got the correct change. 

I love the food and relaxed feeling of eating at Lolo's but I will never return with a group larger than 5, since they seem less than capable of attenting to a large party."}
{"text":"OK. Maybe its me or I caught Lolo's on an off day or something but the chicken was average, be honest I've made better chicken at home and I don't cook chicken that often. Seems like it wasn't seasoned enough. The waffle was soft and bland, eggos out the box are crisper. Was kinda pissed because I drove in from Maricopa to try this joint. Sadly I must say it wasn't worth the trip."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure I would like it but this place is amazing. The waffle was to die for and the chicken was the best I have ever had. Also loved the corn bread, iced tea, and French fries. Thank you To our waiter Bruce."}
{"text":"Ok fried chicken. Spongy, thin waffle. Nothing like the true Lo Lo's. Two legs and a waffle with drink for 12.00+ ? Was going to try a side of greens but not for 6.00.
First and last time at sky harbor"}
{"text":"Only because they do not make to-go orders, they lost out on a $200 order by not doing so, plus they got funny hours."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Parking was bad. Parking Lot is shared with a hotel. Food took a lil while to come to the table(40 mins). But the Fried Chicken is Amazing! Sweet Tea is Sweet X 10! Waffles are Pretty good. Still think W. House is one up on them. Planning on going back to try other items."}
{"text":"Im in love with my lo lo's  , love it so much I got a job there come see your girl...."}
{"text":"I've been here at least 10 times so this isn't just a single bad experience or good experience.  First, the waffles are always dry, ALWAYS!  The chicken tastes fantastic.  It not too greasy, has a nice crunch to it and with their hot sauce, fire!  Here is the issue, the chicken is consistently tiny.  The drumsticks look like wing portions.  They used to serve chicken legs that look like small turkey legs, now when my plates arrives, I see more plate than food.  Now, they also serve Kool-Aid, which is incredible, but someone needs to take the sugar scoop away from the Kool-Aid maker and NEVER give it back.  When your Kool-Aid goes down like cough syrup...you might want to back off the sugar a bit.  Nothing like small chicken and thick Kool-Aid!"}
{"text":"Love Lo-Lo's even in the airport the service is great. Cashier is friendly and helpful. 
Always a fan and customer"}
{"text":"Chicken is some of the best in Phoenix. Staff was great :) and the waffles are an awesome size and taste delicious"}
{"text":"I am a long time huge fan of Roscoe's House of Chicken & Waffles out of California, so when Lolo's opened up in the \"orb\" I was quite excited.  I finally went there for breakfast (after a happy 5 hours the day before) so I figured it would hit the spot!  We got right in, and didn't have to wait, and the decor is casual and the place is clean.  I kept imagining it as the old Tokyo Bowl or whatever it used to be, but I quickly got past that when the food came.  I was with a friend so we ordered the KK's platter and shared it.  It had 3 nice pieces of fried chicken, a big waffle, scrambled eggs with cheese and onions (they go heavy on the onions!) and grits dripping with butter.  It was perfect for 2 people.  The chicken is nicely fried, juicy and not overly greasy.  The waffle was thinner in style and had almost a sweet or malt flavor, very nice!  The grits were really good too, but next time I will get them with cheese also...yumo!   After showing my friend how to property eat everything....you put the chicken right on the waffle, douse everything in hot sauce and syrup and dive in....I was off and running to not having a hangover anymore.  And it worked.  I also love the \"jar of drank\" that comes in a big mason jar.  I got the red kool-aid and probably had the little kid kool-aid mustache after, but loved it.  We were too full for dessert, but I bet the red velvet cake is great.  I cannot give it 5 starts because my heart belongs to Roscoe's still.  However, I am SO happy to have chicken and waffles nearby."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Can't beat classic chicken and waffles. I must say though that I am a food lover of sorts. I am addicted to the endless combinations in all varieties of food. I can name hundreds of combos! But when it comes to it and (you know what I mean fellow food connoisseurs) and you are in need of some straight up southern cookin'. I'm tellin' you right now. Lo-Lo's Man! Lo-lo's...! that's all i have to say about that."}
{"text":"I go once a year on my birthday.  I also know not to expect good or fast service at this location.  Love the food, never have room for dessert, and I go home and my clothes STILL smell like fried chicken.  ha ha ha, good stuff."}
{"text":"My wife is from Luisiana, she took me this place that I never been.
Chicken and Waffles are interesting combination and tasty."}
{"text":"Food was great as usual.  Love the new building.  However, the chairs are probably the most uncomfortable chairs I've ever sat in and the music was way too loud.  I don't like shouting at my dinner companions to be heard.  Get better chairs and turn it down during dinner time, please.  If it's going to remain that loud, I'll just get my food to go."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and it was the same as the last time which I appreciate. We were met at the door with a friendly smile and seated quickly. The place was packed with people which was nice. 

I ordered the original 3 pieces of fried chicken with two waffles aka the lo lo. The chicken was very good with great flavor and cooked perfectly. The waffles were the same as the last time. Good but not great. I would expect more from the waffles due to the fact that the word is in the name of the restaurant but overall they are fine. The kool aid was great with zero complaints about it. 

Overall this place is very good and worth the time it takes to drive down to south Phoenix.  I will certainly come back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Definitely going to make this a normal visit instead of waiting 3 years to try it.  Kool Aid in a Mason Jar was all I needed to see to know this was not going to be a typical dining experience and something to remember.  Food was amazing, the staff was friendly and the prices for the portions were more than fair.  Only the off beat location prevents me from making this a 5 star review."}
{"text":"KOOLAID KID reminded me of home...nice touch..i know I know..this is suppose to be about the chicken & waffles, but I must say quenching my thirst is very important to me..so back to the food..it was just that chicken(no flavor) & waffles(nothing special)..mac & cheese was very nice...and the new building was very very nice..okay that's all"}
{"text":"Tried the new location tonight. I probably wouldn't have come in if I knew it was their very first night open. I was a loyal customer at their old location but I don't know what happened to their stellar servers. We sat down quickly, were greeted and brought drinks our server was very nice, we ordered within 10 minuets of sitting down. Unfortunately for the next 45 minuets we waited and waited for our food. First their server told us they were making new waffle batter, then that the chicken tenders were made from scratch so the reason we had to wait longer for our food than the other 5-6 tables that sat down before us was because they ran out of batter and chicken tenders take forever. I don't know for certain if that was the truth because a manager never came over to talk to us or let us know what was happening. It was frustrating seeing people who ordered over 15 minuets after us get their food and almost finish. Unfortunately we ended up leaving after no real explanation or eta on the food. We still paid for our drinks though but unfortunately we won't be back for awhile. Hopefully lolos gets it together. I saw the manager adjusting our bill but no effort to come over and apologize or anything. Being in the industry so long myself I feel like someone dropped the ball tonight not sure who but we were very disappointed."}
{"text":"Visited Lo Lo's for lunch last week and absolutely loved it. We don't have a soul food/southern spot near us so we definitely had high hopes for our stop here. The service was perfect, polite & quick. 
Everything extra requested was responded with a \"no problem\" and a smile. I in no way was looking forward to the waffle, not knowing any better, but I was surprised about how good it was, especially with the fried chicken! Every trip here in the future I won't be passing them up. Our food was so good that we finished every last bite!
(Use the complimentary valet since parking in the neighborhood is practically impossible.)"}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's came highly recommended.   I'm split on my decisions.  The atmosphere was awesome.   Beautifully appointed and decorated.   The food was a little disappointing.   The waffle was thin and the chicken was small and over cooked.   Price wise it was a bit over prices.   $4 for a chicken breast. The music was banging like my iPod was stolen.  I will have to try again to see if it improves."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. I was encouraged to try this restaurant by several people so I had high expectations that it was going to be a good experience. It was the exact opposite. My wife ordered a chicken sandwich without bacon. They took the sandwich back to the kitchen and tried to fool us by simply taking the bacon off and giving the sandwich back to my wife. So disrespectful and careless. Terrible business practice. I called them out on their dishonesty and they finally made a new sandwich but my wife and children had to wait an additional 20 minutes to be served correctly and they still charged us full price for everything. Needless to say we will never return. Bad business practices. Unprofessional."}
{"text":"This place is a must visit when you're in PHX/Scottsdale! Chicken/Waffles may sound like a weird combination but it's actually a heavenly combo.

For newbies I suggest the Soul Food Platter. This will give you a perfect blend of what Lolo's offers. Some of my personal fav's Mac n Cheese, Candy Sweets, cornbread, biscuits n gravy, collard greens etc! 
They even have some great Kool-Aid options with classic southern sweet tea. 

You will get Healthy portions along w flavorful fried chicken that is the best I've ever eaten (except for some homemade chix in Greenville SC)lol.

I've been here over 10 times with various sized parties and every one of the meals were Fantastic! Thank You Lo-Lo's keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Unpopular opinion time, I don't like the chicken, I think it's dry, and I never get it when I go. 

That aside, the waffles are perfect. They're more savory so it goes with the food. If you've never have had grits the first place you should have them is here. Collared greens, fried okra, and the mac and cheese are soo delicious. Cool-Aid? Yes, yes, and yes. It comes in this big ice cold pitcher!! The Red Velvet cake is a true Southern delight, and being from Texas, I think it's perfect. Also the Chrizo is ace!!! The services is so-so, mostly because they're are a lot of teens working. Usually busy so go on an off time, or place an order to pick it up (food travels well)."}
{"text":"This past weekend a couple of my buddies and I from San Diego decided to take a trip to Phoenix to visit some friends.  

Before we left to head home we decided to check out this place because I'm a big fan of Fried Chicken.  

Let me just say that I've been to a few joints from Rosco's in Cali to Amy Ruths in NY....now I can say i've been to Lo-Lo's.  This place was great!  You can always tell how good an establishment is when you see a line.  We went on a Sunday afternoon and just barely made the rush.  As we sat by the bar we were greeted with one of their staff.  He was quite accommodating and friendly!  The decor was on point and it just felt like a \"warm\" place.  

But I didn't come there for the ambience, I came for the food.  

1. Fried Chicken- OMG this chicken was juicy and flavorful.  The skin was crispy but now too crispy.  It was just a very tastety fried chicken.  One of the best I've had in my life.

2. Grape Flavor Kool-Aid- This reminded me of my childhood.  I haven't had Kool-Aid since 5th grade.  The neat thing about it was it was served Ice Cold in a Jar!!! I thought that was pretty interesting and original.

3. Waffles-The waffles they served here are so much tastier than Roscoe's.  The batter was light but it had a good crunch on the outside.  

The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is the Mac & Cheese I ordered.  It wasn't as good as the other places I've eaten before.   There was nothing spectacular about it.  A little disappointing but the chicken made up for it.  

People from Scottsdale are very fortunate to have a place like Lo-Lo's.  I wish we had one here in SD."}
{"text":"the fried chicken was so damn good. not as good as my mama's but thisclose. i can't wait to visit phoenix again and try some of the other items on the menu. the mac and cheese was a little dry but i'll just chalk that up to a one time thing. i'll mos def get it again.  oh, and the staff and service was great. especially candi jo."}
{"text":"Really great food, nothing bad to say about the service . Only complaint would be how full I was! Hahha. This is definitely the place to go in Arizona if you're looking for good chicken & waffles! Glad that they came to scottsdale about 5 years ago too so I won't have to drive down to the original"}
{"text":"This place speaks for itself as it ALWAYS seems to be busy. Great food! Ordered food to go and everything was in the to-go bag. Not much parking, okay well really, I could not find one parking spot, aside from valet, and it can be chaotic as most of the spots, which are labeled, all seem to belong to the hotel next door, but was able to simply pull up along side the \"To-Go\" window, run in and grab our food. The potato salad is SO good as well as the mac & cheese. It's a toss up between the chicken and catfish as both are delicious! Definitely recommend either."}
{"text":"This place is over priced I had the most expensive plate and I wanted to try everything I was told was good the chicken breast the waffle the macaroni and cheese and the kool aid.  Yes it's good but not delicious especially not for the price.  I have been invited again to meet up with friends for brunch and I say no.  That's how much I didn't like it."}
{"text":"This place is really cute and the service was great. However, the menu is WAY over the top. It has too much added...bananas, chocolate, walnuts, fried chicken, etc to the breakfast items. I could not get 2 scrambled eggs, with hash browns and bacon. Maybe lunch or dinner are better but I ended up with plain French toast, which was good, but still over the top."}
{"text":"Lolo's reminds me of the good old southern cooking I could find growing up in Columbia Mo. A lot of my friends mothers would cook great soul food and this reminds me of when I was a kid. 
Today was my second visit to this place. It was as good or better than the first time a few months ago. This time I have the \"Betty Boop\", a single waffle, with a huge chicken breast, with a side of bacon and a side of fried Okra. I was full half way through but kept eating because it was all sooo good!!! If your on a diet this can't be the best place to go, but if your skipping a day on your diet, or just don't care, then get over to this place for great food. It is located in the ghetto, but the place is very clean and the staff is friendly. Everyone is happy because of the great food and people!!"}
{"text":"Simply the best food I have ever eaten!!! The atmosphere is fun, you are treated like a friend or family member by the staff, an IT IS LITERALLY THE BEST MEAL OF MY LIFE. I had 3 chicken tenders, grits and 1 waffle. The Dr Pepper out of the mason jar was delicious as well. I will always come back!"}
{"text":"Recently took my first trip to Lo-Los with high hopes after hearing great things. The experience was underwhelming to say the least. It has a new, fresh look with a fun Southern feel (even have a DJ), but the menu is where Lo-Los falls short. The prices are too high for the tastiness of the food. I ordered a side of cole slaw for $4 and the portion was smaller than expected and tasted like nothing more than shredded cabbage tossed in miracle whip. The house fries are incredible; mine were perfectly cooked. The food was good, but definitely not great. Fun place to try but not somewhere I'd return to again and again."}
{"text":"Today was our first time to Lo Lo's and it won't be the last time! We went to the Scottsdale location and the customer service was excellent. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and had a table within 20 minutes. Our server was just as friendly. 

The menu offers many choices so everyone should find options to their liking. Remember this is not diet food so if you expect that and then provide a poor review...shame on you. This is good old fashioned comfort food and did not disappoint. The fried chicken was some of the best we have ever had and the sides were plentiful and very tasty. The gravy with onions was pretty amazing too. My wife really enjoyed the homemade lemonade and I indulged in the grape Kool Aid which was like being a kid again. 

We ended up bringing home plenty of leftovers and had to bring home a slice of the Red Velvet cake. The cake was very moist and not too sweet which was a pleasant surprise and nice finish to our evening."}
{"text":"Lolos is a place i used to love... but i will never ever spend money there again. I will also tell everyone I know about the terrible management and Terrible owner... Larry has the most disgusting and disrespectful attitude ive ever seen. Today he told a party of 10 to \"get the fuck out\" multiple times... he also tells his employees to shut the fuck up and he talks down to them whenever he gets a chance and he does not care if paying customers see and hear. Lolos will never get another dime of my money...smh I rate lolos a big fat zero"}
{"text":"Stop!!! don't waste your time going here the food was cold and omg!! nothing I taste had any seasoning stay away if you like flavor, also the place was empty that should of been my first clue."}
{"text":"Chicken & waffles were great and the purple kool-aid was a nice addition! I'll definitely be back! They also play good music!"}
{"text":"First time for me having chicken and waffles as we don't have them in the UK!
 Okay so I want to start saying that the food is great, it really is but that's where it stops. 
The wait you're almost guaranteed to face is atrocious and the servers don't give you accurate times. The first time I visited I told them I had a flight in two hours and they assured me it was fine. That time we spent 1 and and half hours waiting before we had to leave without eating. 
We gave LoLo's a second chance whilst passing through Phoenix and once again the same inaccurate waiting times were being told to everyone.
When we were seated and ordered the first waitress we dealt with was lovely, a bit smile and very helpful, however another waitress who did stop by ant one point was so rude and uncaring it put me off coming here again. No greetings, no smile, she looked like she HATED her job and we could feel it.
The food was great though, lightly season chicken that was tender and juicy without any grease. A simple light waffle to accompany it with a nice little pot of syrup. I order over-medium eggs on the side that came out undercooked and when I returned them they came back completed solid and overcooked which was a shame.
The meals didn't leave us full at all. I had 2 eggs, 1 waffle and 3 chicken pieces and my partner had 2 wings and a waffle. We both wanted to eat more but considering our bill was already at $25 with no drinks we decided against it. Unfortunately the food is overpriced in my opinion and the portion sizes are now massive and just aren't filling.
I wouldn't come here again, the wait times, hit and miss service and expensive food (2.50 for a single piece of chicken) make it not worth it for us.

LoLo's is one of those restaurants that knows it has guaranteed business so it doesn't try as hard as it should."}
{"text":"The food arrived fast and was super good. Some of the best waffles i have ever had. BUT it took more than 45 mins for us to get sitted. I get that it was 8 of us. But it wasnt even that busy. And 2 transactions per bill is bullshit! Specially if its 100+ bill. We get that it says on the menu but still we are your costumers you cant just take one more credit card. We would have appreciated it and probably end up coming back but nooo brother got all mad and walked away. Roscoes would have hook it up."}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in a long time.  Waffles are incredible, chicken perfect, and corn bread was just right."}
{"text":"Some of the best chicken I've had, moist and chalk-full of flavor .  waffles were spot on as well!  Can't go wrong with a place that serves Kool-Aid!"}
{"text":"Would love to the review the food but we've been here an hour and consider ourselves lucky to get an iced tea. On the up side the tea isn't bad......

Hire more servers please"}
{"text":"I like a hot dog at a ballgame as much as the next guy, but I also appreciate that many parks are attempting to step their culinary game up.  I was in a decidedly non-hot dog mood so I roamed the stands in search of something different.  I knew as soon as I came across it that I would be eating the chicken and waffles at Lo-Lo's.  I got the Double Play, which was a fried breast and leg along with two waffles.  The chicken had a great spiced, crispy crust on it and was still juicy inside.  The waffles were fluffy and had great cinnamon/nutmeg notes.  Plenty of butter, syrup, and hot sauce was provided.  The portion was very big, which helped achieve value that is rare in ballpark concessions."}
{"text":"Ate here last week for the first time! Awesome food, really liked the atmosphere, service was good too.  A friend recommended this place to me multiple times and glad I finally had a chance to try it.  Had a lot of food...chicken fried chicken smothered in sausage gravy, waffles that had a hint of cinnamon taste and lots of butter and syrup, Mac n cheese, cheesy grits, corn bread muffin, a bowl of fried gizzards, and koolaide! Everything was delicious and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.  Great place to tell people about if they ask what's there to do in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I love Lo-Lo's. In fact, whenever I am in the area, I head here for lunch. Note, they are moving locations in September. New location will be on Scottsdale and Drinkwater. Always friendly and fast service. My go to - red Kool-Aid, 1 waffle and 2 chicken wings, #7. Delish!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit here. SInce our last visit they have moved down the street to this new location. I am not an expert on *real* Southern cooking. But I do know Chicken and I am not unfamiliar with Soul food. And to me, and our group of four, this is GOOD food. The chicken is crispy but juicy and properly done on the inside without being greasy. They obviously start with good meaty chicken. The corn muffins are great and the sweet potatoes were unbelievable. The fried okra was good but nothing special. 

No waffles this trip, but I do recall that last time I had them they were pretty good. I passed on waffles this time since it is not too hard to find (or make at home) good waffles. But great chicken is a something worth crossing the road for. The outside covered patio was nice on a spring day."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely horrible for the $25 I paid .  Chicken was not seasoned and one piece was burnt looking.  Waffles were limp, mac n cheese taste like it came straight out a box and lastly my Peach cobbler had very little crust and a million peaches....  I went to the Lolo's before about 3 years ago on Scottsdale Rd. and the food was delicious, but since they moved to this new location, it was plain just nasty and overpriced.  Maybe they have a new cook but I definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Fried chicken and waffles are da bomb whoed dunk! Stay hood homie!"}
{"text":"Very long wait it took the staff almost 30 mins to clean tables due to dancing, the food is amazing but when I'm high I'm hungry...staff friendly"}
{"text":"The food is sooooo delicious! However the menu is priced like an upscale restaurant which it obviously is not. Almost four dollars for coffee? No thanks. 

However the food really is on point. Big enough portions to share so it all works out."}
{"text":"On the 4th of July we brought our son out with us before we went to the ball game.  Towards the end of dinner, he got sick and ended up vomiting.  DO NOT expect the wait/bus staff to help you if this happens to your children.  2 servers and a bus boy stood there, frozen not sure what to do.  They all looked so unprofessional, like they had not seen someone throw up before.  The bus boy stood there with a wet towel in his hand, while another waiter (from a different station) had to jump in and hand me napkins.  For you parents out there...you know \"paper\" napkins only go so far.  I had to literally tell the bus boy to give me the wet rag he was holding, before he snapped out of his staring trance and walked away.  We have always loved   LoLo's, however this time was very different.  The staff was so unprofessional and cold towards us.  We saw a manager walk past us and look 3 times and he never once stopped to see what had happened or checked on us to see if we needed anything.  So disappointing!"}
{"text":"I am sold on the whole chicken and waffles thing!!!  I love LoLo's Chicken and waffles, they are by far the BEST southern food I have had.  I tried collards for the first time, on my most recent visit, fantastic!
Way to go LoLo's!"}
{"text":"Yummy chicken and to-die-for waffles with all that buttery goodness. I had gone there with a few colleagues for lunch and though it took them time to seat us and we could not sit together the food more than made up for it."}
{"text":"Service is okay. Mac n cheese sucked, noodles were mushy and it was chalky. The Catfish was bland. The chicken and gravy was good, and the Kool aid in the jars was kinda cool and unique. Overall, disappointed."}
{"text":"Horrible don't eat there. My chicken was so dry and old for the money I paid...they should get zero stars."}
{"text":"I guess my BF has been holding out on me as we have been visiting the Scottsdale area for the past two years when he has been working down here and he never took me to  lolos until this weekend. Maybe he thought it was too humble or not \"foodie\" enough or something but I really like this place.  I enjoyed the clientele, the waitstaff, and the food. 
We came on Friday night and didnt have long to wait. The menu was amazing and had so many options, it was hard to begin. We both ended up with the fried chicken which was really good but too much food. I'm not often a fan of cornbread, but this was  just really good, light, not too sweet and served with a big mound of butter. Our server Danielle was a sweetheart, very friendly and competent. I was impressed by the large mason jars of water and iced tea and,had I been able to drink that much sugar, would have had the blue kool aid which for some reason was calling to me. 
The other patrons were a diverse and friendly. We talked to the people on either side of us and asked for recommendations which they were happy to provide. 
It was so good we came back today for breakfast, which impressed me just as much as the previous visit with friendly and interesting servers who took time to chat and discuss a bit of life philosophy. I had the biscuits and gravy-  gravy on the side just in case - and I'd say it was the best, most flavorful sausage gravy I've ever had. Delicious. And the biscuits were perfect, like homemade but better.
Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Food is good (fries are not...they were stale and waffel limp) but not.WOW. You can get a better waffel at waffel house.

The service.
If you are in a hurry or want to eat your dinner in under an hour SKIP THIS PLACE. A  simple chicken and waffel dinner...the two things they specialize in took over 30 minutes.   The restaurant wasn't busy. During the wait, the server completely ignored us and when our food was finally delivered, we inquired as to the wait time only to receive the response...we cooked your food really good and tasty even though it took us a while.

The server got the tip she did, albeit small, because she was pleasant...that's it.

It is obvious the owner doesn't care or doesn't know how to fix the problem.

SKIP LO LO'S"}
{"text":"For a 1st timer I wanted to be honest but I hope to return to a better experience.
Parking was tight. It was raining & waiting area was small & in the way of receptionist desk. We were told to move aside but there was nowhere to move. Wait staff were energetic & friendly. Very helpful with chosen the right meal! Lemonade was delish! Next time I will try it mixed with Koolade. Wait was ok for lunch time. One of 3 plates came & we were told tables were put in wrong order so other 2 plates would take a few min. Chicken wasn't too flavorful but was perfectly cooked & juicy! Tasted great with the ranch. Waffle was tasty & crispy but soft inside! Food was hot. Plate was more than enough. Atmosphere was well spaced & not too busy on walls which I like. Will return! If not for mix up of tables & awkward wait area would've gotten 4 stars."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Always have a good meal.   I always get the Betty boop with a side of cheesy grits.  This is the only place that I will eat the grits.  My only complaint is that they close at 4pm on Sunday."}
{"text":"I had heard about chicken & waffles for a long time, and never had an opportunity to try them. 
When I had them at LoLo's in Scottsdale I was NOT disappointed. 
The fried chicken was among the best I have ever had. It was like being in the south.
When you follow the fried chicken with a tasty huge waffle, it's like dessert, but better.
I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Traveled to Phoenix via car and after five hours on the road, the food at Lo Lo's hit the spot.  We arrived around 8p on a Tuesday evening and it was 2/3 full.  We were seated immediately.  Staff was attentive.  Ordered food and it was on the table within ten minutes popping hot.  Chicken, waffles, cheesy eggs, cheesy grits, greens ... wonderful meal!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Lo-Lo's, and though the food was SO good, the service wasn't. We had no trouble parking like other reviewers. Once inside, I got the Toy-Toy, and it was super tasty. Their waffles are incredible! Honestly best I've ever had. We also got the catfish beignets which weren't that special, although I don't like catfish. However the service, as other have said, wasn't good at all. They asked us if we wanted our appetizer first and we said yes, then they brought it to us halfway through our main course. Our waitress didn't refill any drinks, so we actually shared one towards the end. Then they split the check wrong. In the end, if you're okay with meh service the food is honestly worth it."}
{"text":"I have been to Lo-Lo's several times and various locations. The first time I went was the best and each time it seems to go downhill, unfortunately! The chicken breasts have had no meat on them and have been extremely dry. Don't know if they changed where they get the chicken or if it is just pre-cooked and gets dried out! Either way the quality seems to have gone downhill! I know there are other things to order there but always feel I should order chicken and waffles, but again, I've been very disappointed the last few times!"}
{"text":"My personal favorite was the catfish chicken combo plate, with a side of okra and a side of cheesey grits. The portions are huge and the atmosphere is beyond welcoming. Not to mention, the kool aid runs from a tap. Lolo's is an amazing establishment."}
{"text":"The food was great as always, however, Nathan, who was our server was not up to LoLo's standards.  We had a large party for a friends birthday and had called in advance.  We were lectured about how he had to do everything a certain way and was upset when more people came in and took seats.  We were moving down to make room!  I understand that it is hard to work with a big group but we are adults and were socializing, which is why we chose to come here.  When some of us needed to leave and were trying to pay the bills which he knew we were all separate, he told one of the party, \"It isn't going to matter whether I take your payment now or 10 minutes from now.  Okay, I'll put you at the bottom of the list!\"  WHAT!?  I won't stop eating at LoLo's but I won't be back to this one and I won't be recommending it.  At one point, during one of his tirades/lectures, he said, \"Yeah, this has turned into a real sh!t show.\"  He was upset because we were switching seats and talking.  There were about 30 or us.  We would have figured it out when the food came out.  Totally unnecessary!  Extremely disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I haven't had a lot of experience with Southern home-style cooking, but if this is what it tastes like, you can bet I'll be eating it a lot more!
The whole vibe of this place is relaxed and family/group friendly. Not to mention the servers are incredibly nice. I even loved the country interior- it was done really nicely!
Ok now the food. It was on the brink of heavenly and I could not stop eating it. Their koolaid (served in huge mason jars with free refills) is better than normal koolaid, and make sure someone gets the lemonade just to say you tried it. Chicken and waffles are perfect. The waffles are these light, crispy beauties with a hint of cinnamon I want to say? And the green beans rock if you dig spicy. Grits are good. Mac and cheese is really good. And make sure you save room for dessert because none of it disappoints!
My mouth is watering as I write this. Just take it from me and my friends and family- this place is just that good. Go on and try it for yourself! (They have 2 locations- Scottsdale and Phoenix.)"}
{"text":"I just had the best fried chicken omelette, ever! It did take a while for the food to come out but it was well worth the wait. The service was fantastic for it being 7am. I have been here several times and this location never fails to impress."}
{"text":"A little hard to find and the exterior may throw you off but you would be making a HUGE mistake to not enter one of the best soul food gems in AZ. The staff is more amazing than the food and that is not an insult to the food but as a restaurant mangers view just as important. Friendly- funny- upbeat. Go early or you may have to wait outside. The word is out and its a 4 star place I will go back to."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place! Food and service is always A1. My only complaint is the KoolAid is way OVERPRICED!!!!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I was quite skeptical of the combination of fried chicken and waffles.  Believe it or not, this combo works!  Yes, it may not be the healthiest thing, but it is quite tasty as a once in a while meal.  This is a great southern restaurant, and the drinks are served in mason jars.  You can even get Kool-Aid (red or blue).  I am a fan."}
{"text":"This place is hands down fantastic!  I ordered the fried chicken and catfish plate.  It came with my choice of sides, fried okra and mac & cheese.  There was also a buttered corn muffin.  For dessert I got the banana pudding  because I am a sucker for anything with banana.  The waitress was attentive, fast and friendly.  Only one tiny complaint...I have had better Mac & cheese."}
{"text":"Just ate at the Phoenix location and the food was good, but the service was awful. It's a shame...won't go back! Bye..."}
{"text":"All of the food here is amazing, chicken is tender you have to get pecans in your waffles. The biscuits and gravy is flavorful. The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. Definitely will continue to come and eat here!"}
{"text":"I've been to Lo-Lo's before but not this location.
Dinner was good- really good.  Crispy chicken legs, gooey cheesy grits and creamy and yummy mac-n-cheese -the service was ok, but the peach cobbler was a complete disappointment.
Took over 15 mins and was room temperature -not hot or even lukewarm.
Not sure if the server forgot but it was a complete let down.

My fiancé said it was the ice cream that cooled it.  But the fact that I could touch the ramekin told me otherwise.  Even half way down the cobbler, still not warm.  Won't order that ever again."}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's is a great place and most certainly lives up to the hype. It's small, dated and it has a cool ambiance  The parking sucks but don't let that stop you from going to Lo-Lo's. 

They have some of the best fried chicken I've tasted and I loved their waffles.  The mac-n-cheese is different but very good! You can order eggs any way you like them.  

I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Soul Food at its finest! Gotta love the ambiance of the place and the two levels. Kool-Aid on the menu is so authentic as are the mason jars for beverages. 

Love their well-known staple, Chicken & Waffles. When I moved to the Valley from the Midwest in the mid 90s, I had not ever heard of this combination. I liked fried chicken and waffles but never would have considered them being part of the same meal. First tasted it at their original location and loved it. Was skeptical they could go out to Scottsdale and duplicate the same tastes, but they put my hesitation to rest. The side dishes, greens, macaroni and cheese, yams, are all delish! Only thing I wish they would change is having specific desserts only available certain days.

Overall, would definitely recommend this Soul Food Restaurant to tourists and residents of the Valley."}
{"text":"The food here is good and I've been going to LoLo's for years, but service is hit or miss especially with the manager Maurice. I called one day and they advised me that there were no to go orders, I asked to speak to the manager because I had limited lunch and previously when there's been no to go orders someone at the restaurant allowed me to do one or he'd have me come in and be seated and I'd have my food boxed so I would be in and out with time remaining to get back to work on time. Maurice wouldn't let me speak and kept yelling at me that there is no to go orders and I said I understand I just wanted to ask if you could...and he wouldn't let me say anything. Then I said what kind of customer service are you providing? You're not letting me speak an she told me that he did not care and he was not wanting to listen to me and hung up the phone in my face. He is super rude and not fit to deal with people. I would not have asked if people in the restaurant had not worked with me in the past, I used to go at least 1-2 times a week which is why they worked with me. I had never not shown up to pick up an order or anything. Other than this issue I loved the place and the service with others who work there."}
{"text":"Loved this place, we just ran into it while exploring Scottsdale and what a pleasant surprise. We are from the south and have pretty ridged standards when it comes to mac & cheese and collard greens. All the food we had was amazing as well as the sweet tea. The staff was friendly and very informative. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Waited about 25 min for a seat on a Sunday morning which is not bad.  They seem a bit under staffed we waited about 10 min for someone to take our drink order, and another 15 min after we got our drinks to take our food order and that's only because I asked the waiter to take our order.  We ordered the no.1, no.8, no.10 and I a no.3. The waffles were good but the chicken was soggy not even crispy, i guess I'm use to the crispy chicken from Roscoes they really set the bar high.  Drinks were good and also the menu has a lot of cool funny names for their food.  Overall an ok experience"}
{"text":"This really is an awesome greasy spoon soul food mecca in Phoenix. The food is affordable, and always taste great!! The services is so so, nevertheless they get the business done. The lunch bunch is extremely active and you need to wait outside for a table. In the event you get their before 11:15 you should not have to wait. Go with all the sweet tea & you'll be on a sugar high all day!! Wonderful food on a regular basis! Greatest chicken & waffles in the planet."}
{"text":"BEST KOOL-AID EVER!
Seriously, that's easily it's number one draw for me.
Order a \"jar of drank\" and it'll come out to you, ice cold (which is a great refresher from the summer heat here) in a mason jar. Free refills during your visit and they'll even give you a styrofoam \"to-go\" cup if you request it.

On top of that, this was my FIRST official \"chicken and waffles\" experience and I was surprised at how well the two go together.
The waffles are a perfect consistency: Not too crisp, not to fluffy.
As for the chicken, it's fried with the perfect recipe and just add a little honey and you're golden!
A delicious meal with large proportions. You'll struggle with a full stomach to finish such a treat!

Since my first visit, I've been to the \"infamous\" Rocco's Chicken and Waffles and then returned to Lo-Lo's and I must admit, Lo-Lo's is BY FAR the victor. There is no doubt in my mind that Lo-Lo's is leaps and bounds better than Rocco's. The food is better, the atmosphere is better, the service is better.

Lo-Lo's offers great service (the people that work here are really nice and hospitable), great atmosphere, great food, and, most importantly for me, GREAT KOOL-AID!

Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great Food and great service.  Must try Mac n Cheese and Catfish...oh and the Sour Apple KoolAid is delicious!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Friendly attentive service from Erica Lu! Had the Phat Azz Chicken Sandwich and and my man had the Betty's Boob. So good. For dessert, Sweet Potato Pie! We want to come back and we haven't even left the restaurant yet!!!"}
{"text":"Not cool Lo-Lo's, the food took 40 minutes and without apologies.

In addition, we were missing items, like eggs and grits that are part of the order. 

Your food is good, but not good enough to overlook the poor service."}
{"text":"We had an amazing time last Thursday!  We went in for a birthday dinner and got more than we could have asked for.  The chicken was perfect, the atmosphere and music were on pint and our Server, Carl was hilarious!  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. Never in my life have I witnessed such bad management and Customer service. We walk in there tonight and we had to wait at least five minutes before anyone even acknowledged we were there. Then this lady with dark hair walks up, looking like she'd rather be anywhere but working. She said two? Then immediately followed with dogs are not allowed. I replied with he is not a dog he is a service animal. She said it doesn't matter you have to sit outside. I said oh well you must not be up to date on your laws, I'll just talk to your manager. Then she proceeds to say I am the manager. I was shocked she even said that bc of how she was acting, her body language and the way she approached the situation. It must've been her very first ever in the customer service industry. But whatever I went on to say ok well a service animal is allowed anywhere humans are allowed. She said I don't care you still have to sit outside. Then I proceeded to say ok well this is a lawsuit waiting to happen bc I could sue you for refusing me service indoors bc I need a service animal. She then snickers, chuckles and had an attitude and grabbed the menus. I then said you know what I'm not going to waste my money here. She said ok and we left. If I was the owner of LoLo's I would not only embarrassed that someone so unprofessional, rude, and unwelcoming was the first person my paying customers see and interact with, but also that she is running your store in the manner that she is running it. I've never been treated so poorly or rudely in my entire life. she has to be the worst manager I've ever come across. I wouldn't be surprised if this has happened before where she does not care about the customers or making regulars. Let alone I've never been in an establishment where I am not even welcomed or acknowledged and so quickly pushed out the door. The way I look at it was that she was thinking less work for me oh well. Very very unpleasant all around. Needs to teach employees the laws and fire the horrible manager and start fresh."}
{"text":"Came to the airport to drop my boyfriend's mom off, so we thought we'd eat together here before she left. We've been to the other Lo-lo's in Arizona before, so we know how good their food is. The food here, however, was a little.. different.

My boyfriend and his mom ordered the Tre Tre which comes with two fried chicken drumsticks and a waffle. I ordered a waffle and a side of fries. They both said that the breading of the drumsticks were a little too salty and the drumsticks seemed really small. 

The waffles at Lo-lo's usually have a slight cinnamon flavor and are crispy, but we all agreed that the waffles here were soggy and didn't have a strong \"waffle\" flavor. The syrup wasn't thick either and was really runny. The fries, however, were extra crispy. They were thinner than I remembered and didn't have the seasoning on top, but I still enjoyed them.

I would have given this place 2 stars, but the guy who took our order was very nice and gave us a lot of ketchup!"}
{"text":"I hate to even give this place a 1 star review because it literally deserves nothing. I was enjoying my meal with friends, eating chicken and waffles when all of the sudden I turn my chicken over, AND THERE WAS LITERALLY A CHICKEN BRAIN STUCK TO THE BOTTOM. Now, I didn't really care because I can understand how it could happen but when the manager was notified, he literally said straight to my face that it was not a brain, and perhaps a gizzard. Im sorry, but if you have eyes, you could tell it was a brain. Even so, there was something in my food that shouldn't of been. He stood there and argued with me, making a scene. Even the server who took my food to the manager, said it was a brain and was disgusted. The manager did not say sorry, said he wouldn't comp my meal because I had eaten most of it before finding the brain. How in the hell is this guy a manager.... we asked nicely to have it comped and everyone knows it is super easy to do, yet he refused. I was literally so chill about it till he told me it wasn't a brain. He finally comped my meal because I didn't eat all of my waffles and barely finished my drink, NOT BECAUSE THERE WAS A BRAIN IN MY FOOD, after 10 minutes of arguing and convinicing and threatening to walk out. I was literally shaking and can't believe the reaction. I have videos that could make this shit go viral. Don't eat here, unless you're okay with bad service and like to eat brains. Photo to follow. That is all."}
{"text":"They've got a live DJ!!

Just had to get that out there. I've had the misfortune of a bad experience out in their Scottsdale location, but when I had a girlfriend in town who had just been craving fried chicken, well. There's really not any other place in Phoenix to go to. Except Mrs. White's. And they weren't open late enough.

I didn't know what to expect. I knew that the food would probably be good. That it was in a ghetto part of town. Not to be on a diet before I got here. The basics. 

I was really quite impressed. They had clearly renovated recently. It's bright and stylish and modern. Very busy, and quite loud, thanks to the crowd of people and aforementioned DJ. The food is straight up soul food fare- chicken and waffles, beans and rice, mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. You can get kool aid or lemonade or sweet tea in giant mason jars. The food came out quickly, but was piping hot and fresh. (Unlike our experience with the other location.) My chicken had beautifully crispy skin. My grits were okay. A bit thick and gooshy, but really the star of the show here is the chicken, so frankly I didn't care too much that the sides were a little more mediocre. 

We were so stuffed to the gills at the end we had no room for red velvet cake or any of the tempting sweets. Till next time, Lo-lo's. Till next time."}

{"text":"Excellent...... Need I say more. We came from California to Phoenix to attend a football game. This was are first time out there so my husband yelp a few food spots to try and I must say it was worth it. Everything was great from the service to the food. Definitely will be going back...."}
{"text":"Food was awsome.   The chicken and waffles were awsome.  A little slow coming out but turned out to be wort it."}
{"text":"I tried lo- lo's  for the first time and had two pieces of chicken and a waffle with sweet tea. The waffle and sweet tea were top notch. You couldn't have better waffles or tea anywhere else. But the chicken was too dry and very small. Not worth the price for the size. The service was great and so friendly. I may go back if I'm craving chicken and waffles but not completely thrilled to go again and again."}
{"text":"It was alright, I had the chicken and waffles, no comparison to Rasco's Chicken & Waffles in LA, nice atmosphere, and descent service, nice family restaurant."}
{"text":"OH MY Heavenly Heart attack!  Great grease food with soul.  We got the chicken waffles of course and enjoyed every bite!  Cute jars they serve your drinks in.  Nothing fancy but great place for quick casual food."}
{"text":"I feel like they rely too much on their reputation... don't get me wrong, the food is AMZAING but the serivce is not so great.  Long waits I can handle - the place is practically a legend in the valley, but every time I go people in my party are left without things they ordered, drinks run out, things come out in the wrong order etc.  

On this last visit I ordered a few corn breads and told the server I wanted them to come out as an appetizer.  They came out with the main course and I just got a casual mention - \"sorry they took so long to come out\".  That kind of defeated the purpose of ordering them since now everyone was interested in their actual food.  We also noticed that the table seated near us - with about the same number in their party - were seated well after us and served before us.  And we didn't take very long to order it was just really slow and disorganized!  I was also a little sad because they didn't even bring syrup automatically, so of course I asked for it when they brought out our food.  Saw the server make a few more runs to other tables while my food got cold waiting for syrup...

Another member in the group realized his chicken and waffles from the KK never arrived... so we flagged down an employee who got our server.  They brought them out eventually but just so much that could have been better!  And not even an apology!  We only had a party of 7 so it's not like we took over the restaurant.  I think maybe the key here is to go, but not order any of the extras because it seems like that's where a lot of the problems come from."}
{"text":"After reading reviews here on yelp and hearing from a few friends that Lolos is awesome, I was so excited to eat there.  I think I may have had expectations that were too high..... but I really wasn't too impressed. My chicken was kind of dry, the mac and cheese was a little bland and I can't really complain about the collards, I think they just aren't my thing. The waffles were pretty good though (getting them with pecans is tasty). Overall the food was ok and I did love the cool-aid, but prices were high for just one piece of chicken and a waffle."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! I went for the first time yesterday and OMG!! Great service and amazing food"}
{"text":"Maybe I hit them on a bad day but parking was valet only and all the spots in front of the restaurant were marked as hotel only. Yet I passed about 30 open hotel spots next to the hotel.

I have wanted to try LoLo's for years and my first visit I was very disappointed. The chicken was hard, dry and way over cooked. 

The chicken and waffles at Prison Hill Brewery in Yuma are far superior. Stop there for lunch on your way to San Diego sometime."}
{"text":"I go to Lo-Lo's almost ever 2-3 weeks for lunch because it's right across the street from work. Sometimes every week even. Today is not a busy day. I got seated right away. Ordered my usual. 25 min later. No food. No one to check on me. While the guy next to me who ordered 6-10 min after me was already enjoying his lunch. Maybe next time if I have 2 hours to spare for my lunch break."}
{"text":"Chicken was incredible, the waffle was a little too soft.  Service was fast and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time a couple months ago, based on the Yelp reviews & the food (chicken & waffles, in particular) was very Good. The establishment is very nice with outdoor patio seating if you like & it has several TV around the place if you want to watch the game.
Customer service was fine, the waitress were friendly & my food came out Hot.

I will definitely be back whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"I would've given Lolo's a 5 star if it weren't for the ridiculously bad service here.
I've been to this location on multiple occasions and have always spent tons of money with my wife on meals and yet the last two times I've been here I've being treated very rudely and made to wait for cold food. The first occasion I ordered to go, I ordered ahead of time to make sure that it would be ready they said it would be ready around 12:20pm i got there at 12:10pm the food was already bagged up and sitting there cold the waffle cold and like rubber they might I add they forgot my cornbread and my waffle I had to go out to my car and look in the bag to notice they weren't in the bag after paying my $17.00 for it. I got to work I was on my lunch break and called to reach out to their manager who asks me to come back but I told him I only had a 30 min lunch and couldnt return until after 6pm and he said thats fine but wanted the food. I couldnt come by after work as I had to pick up my kids from daycare on the other side of town then he ignore my attempts to reach out to him until today 12/6/2015 I called him and he said he would not replace my food as they get calls like mine all the time and that he'd do something nice for us but not replace the food I said thats fine I'm coming in with my wife Ill see you in a minute. We get there are seated at 5:35pm we explain that I'd like to see the manager the waitress then says ok I will get him, she asks us what we want to drink we order a water and a sweet tea and we wait 15 mins for our drinks ready to order we see her help everyone else and even brings us napkins after 15 mins! and doesnt ask us for our order or even bring us our drinks! We had to ask a nice young man by the name of Jacquan who immediately helped us pt in our order, then the waitress suddenly shows up with our drinks and seems upset she says I talked to the manager and he just said he'd give you a dessert, so instead of confronting and greeting his guest he hides behind his staff and doesn't even come out and speak to us. Then the waitress who is now upset doesnt speak to us for the rest of the night. Meanwhile we wait and see everyone else already eating a person who was seated just before us already eating and almost done it is now 6:45pm and we have not even received our appetizer we ordered nor our food everyone is now leaving as they were closing at this time cleaning and putting up chairs around us. We finally receive our food and my plattter which includes cornbread, doesnt have cornbread they tell me that they are out of cornbread, wow so I come here already have a bad previous experience my food isnt replaced and to top it off they are out of the food I ordered. They then bring my wifes food which is a chili bowl and its frozen cold and has cold non melted cheese on top as if it had been sitting in the window until our chicken was done then they just threw some cheese on it, ridiculous.... To make things worst theres now only three people in the resteraunt they are paying their bills and we barely receiving our food now feel rushed as the entire staff keeps looking at us basicaly wanting to leave so we did'nt even get to enjoy our meal we just paid $30.00 for that was cold my wife didnt even eat because she didnt want to put in another order and make everyone wait for us as we already waiting an hour for cold food and no cornbread.... The chicken is great but they service needs to be taken up there should be a certain standards to the quality of service they are giving to their loyal paying customers."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. Every time I'm flying out of Skyharbor terminal 4. They have more locations across the valley."}
{"text":"I had tried Lo Lo's before at their last location in Scottsdale and thought how great it was.  I decided to bring my friends to the new location.  Needless to say, I won't be back.  I was so disappointed in our experience and I wasn't the only one.  It was very busy the day we went- Oct 31st, 2014 - However, it looked as if the restaurant had not planned for that.  There were not enough staff on and the staff they had looked confused.  We sat at the bar and did not get noticed for about 20 minutes.  We had to ask for menus.  There were people around us complaining about how long it took to get their food.  The staff seemed as if they did not care.  There was only one bartender and she seemed to be in her own world.  We waited almost 45 minutes for our food.  I asked for a refill on coffee and that took another 25 minutes and I had to ask twice.  The kicker was they did not give me a new cup and she poured old coffee and when she realized it was bad she said she would get me new - however put the same old cup back.  When the new coffee came another person took my old cup and poured coffee into it... 
Even the guy next to us was complaining how slow the service was.  They never apologized and as we were leaving I saw a woman complaining to the manager about her poor service and he was YELLING at her back.  This was very unprofessional.
Needless to say my friends were not impressed and I won't be back..."}
{"text":"Stop reading this review and head there now. Clean restaurant, great service, amazing food, great menu, I don't need to say anymore."}
{"text":"Doesn't matter which location you go to in AZ. they are all busy. The staff is fun and friendly.  There service is great but expect to wait for your order of you with a large group. They have a system there to get everyone's order to the table hot...so timing is everything so the chicken is not dry and cold when it arrives at your table. Be patient it's worth the wait.  Kool-Aid is always sweet and tasty..it it's to sweet just order a water and 50/50...but I like it just the way they make it."}
{"text":"This is Arizona's version of Roscoes and it ain't too shabby. A lot of options on the menu ranging from good drinks continued with good food. This is a popular place and there was quite the line before getting a seat."}
{"text":"Food awesome.  Atmosphere awesome Service awesome. Parking is ridiculous tons of empty spaces but you have to valet. Then when you're done wait for your car then there was a shuttle there causing confusion.  My husband uses  a walker and it takes longer than average to load and unload.  Very poor idea."}
{"text":"As the food is amazing the service wasn't so much. The two ladies that greeted me at the door was nice at first. I was just doing a pick up order. I do not tip when it is a takeout/to go.. only if I dine in. I went to sit down and when the other greeter seen i didn't tip she rolled her eyes and told the other lady (I hate that)

Even if she felt I should have tipped she could have kept that attitude to herself. (My opinion) Now I am happy that I did not with her displaying that attitude."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and love the food! But the service definitely could use some work. We came in Saturday and waited about 15 minutes for a table and were sat in the back room, it was only us and another couple.. Eventually it filled up. Our server took forever to great us and got our drink and food order, took forever with our drinks. Waited about a hour for our food until we got impatient while everyone else around us got their food right away. We decided to leave after the table across from us got their food 15 minutes after they ordered and we still had nothing. We didn't hear from our server until the host had to hunt her down for the check for our drinks. Had no problem paying for those but the server seemed really nonchalant about the whole thing and didn't even offer to get the manager or anything just let us leave.. Felt very unwelcome and unappreciated."}
{"text":"It was a great experience. I had the blackened catfish. It was fantastic. The service was great as well."}
{"text":"This is truly one of the WORST businesses I have ever been to in Phoenix. I was here with friends visiting on Thursday evening 03-02-2017.....For starters the Service was so unprofessional and the hostess rude just as if she did not want to be at work. It took all of 40 minutes to be seated and there were tables just not cleaned off. Our waitress was nice but, when the food finally came out, the Chicken was burnt and cold. Ordered New chicken sad to say it came out even worse the 2nd time; the red beans and rice horrible,  white rice and chilli beans I know this is Phoenix but, No soul at all. The young staff was so unprofessional and management could not keep up. If I could I would give this Resturant a negative 1 star. We left all the food  on the table paid or bill $$$ the tip for this business. Upgrade your service and definitely the food....."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here before heading home.  Two people ahead of me in line but had my 'waffle breakfast sandwich' in less than 10 mins.  The waffles were thin and crispy but still soft on the inside.  Mark (the chef I believe) came out during what looked like a lull in service and asked how it was.  I didn't expect good food and friendly service at the airport.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, it's fallen a lot from what it used to be. We were up from Tucson last night and this was the first we'd been to the new building and probably the last.  The chicken was nothing like it used to be.  We made the mistake of coming late, so there was nothing but chicken and waffles available.  No catfish or greens.  They have drinks, but only from their short drink menu.  The old LoLo's was always worth a special trip, but sadly the new incarnation doesn't live up to expectations."}
{"text":"Went here with a party of 11 a few months ago for Sunday brunch. Yes, we were prepared for a long wait on a Sunday morning, but were excited when we were told the wait would be 15 minutes. It ended up taking over an hour and a half after the hostess admittedly seated another party of 11 before us. The frustrating part was that there were at least 5-6 tables free and they wouldn't push them together for us. We asked several times if we could split our party to make the wait shorter, and they insisted  we not do that. Things took a downward turn when the manager loudly and openly raised his voice with my stepdad in front of the entire restaurant. Really not cool. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! It's almost as good as roscoes in California. The waffles are better here and the chicken Is better there. Can you team up and get something together? Lol thanks for the food. When you are out of town it's hard to find a good place that isn't really on the map out right."}
{"text":"I had a fever and the the only thing to cure it was... more LoLo's chicken and waffles!
I was actually there with Dave R. because we had a hankering for fried chicken. We both ordered #3's along with the red Kool-Aid. I opted for beans over rice and Dave had the fried okra. 
The chicken came out nice and hot with just the right amount of crispyness that's not from too much batter or coating, but from the right amount of frying. The waffles were the perfect compliment. The right amount of sweetness along with the heaping spoonfull of butter on top. The rice and beans were knid of put off to the side because of the \"main event\" but were tasty none the less.
My only concern was the sweetness of the Kool-Aid. I couldn't remember the last time I had Kool-Aid, but I never remembering it being this sugary. Maybe my mom had the right idea and only put 1 cup of sugar in to mix. What, the recipe only calls for one cup?
This was my 4th visit to LoLo's since moving out here last year. I was a regular at Roscoe's in Long Beach, CA and the only difference is in the waffle. Roscoe's puts cinamon in their waffle batter that gives it a unique taste. 
Also, unless you have been fasting for a week, the #1 is a lot of food! I finally learned my lesson and went for the #3 and I still couldn't finish my waffles."}
{"text":"Lo Lo's is best at anytime of day!! It was so good I took my entire family there for my post-graduation dinner!! When ever one of my out of town friends come in town I always take them here! Food, service and building are all amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place I wanted to try it for myself. I just moved here from Bowie Md. My Fiancé took me to this location on Monday . I wanted to sit outside and while we were waiting to be served there were two wonderful ladies that were eating their meals and we all had a good conversation. They talked very highly about your restaurant and I couldn't wait to eat. Very good customer service and atmosphere. I'm not going to write a book but let me tell you when I bit into the chicken and waffles OMG SOOOOOO GOOD!  My favorite place to go! We will be back real soon!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Got there when they opened at 8 am, at 845 mexican female waiter had only stopped by once to give us water, in the meantime numerous people came in, were served ahead of us.  We order waffle and egg.  We gave up and left.  I waved on my way out."}
{"text":"Food is very heavy and covered in cooking oil. Waffles seem deep fried and are really heavy and thick in a - you'll need a few glasses of water kind of way- If that makes your taste buds scream with joy then you'll love! Not my personal preference."}
{"text":"Chicken, catfish, redfish, greens, sweet potatoes are off the hook and the corn muffins are huge! Lemonade is sweeeeeeet!"}
{"text":"For a decade I had no interest in eating here because it seemed to just copy Roscoes in LA and I'm not a fan of \"biting\".Yup a '80s kid!Anyway I was surprised and impressed that although the theme is similar to Roscoes...this place stands on its own for PHX residents.Food is good quality and traditional southern.The decor and dining experience is above average,not just mom and pop-ish.The prices are reasonable.Wish I would've gave them the benefit of the doubt and tried them years ago."}
{"text":"This place is Lolo's in name only, the food is like all airport food, over priced and not very good.  My problem here is that less than a 15 minute drive from the airport you would be at the LoLo's on Central in Phoenix which is far, far, far and by far good eats.  This airport spot is truly a blemish to your name and food.

i look forward to getting to eat LoLo's whenever I am near Central location and when I seen one in the airport, and I travel for work nearly every week, I was like, YESSSSS!  But when I ate the food I was like. NOOOOOOOOOOOO....   

Let me break it down for you.  When a you get past the point of hungry people stopping  simply from seeing your business as they pass too, people going out of their way and remembering your name because you stand out, that is called brand.  LoLo's name is a brand name but the food wherever that name is served must live up to the Brand you have created.

I continue to go to the Central location but will not go to the airport.  Hey it's your name I went to in the first place."}
{"text":"I have a one track mind, 
I can't be saved, Lo-Lo's is all I crave

I know I have to face it -- I'm addicted to Lo-Lo's

From the crispy fried chicken, the waffles that melt in your mouth, the attentive service with a warm welcoming smile. 

I just can't get enough.
I know I have to face it -- I'm addicted to Lo-Lo's"}
{"text":"Ugh! Horrible food horrible service all employees are teens who are careless & rude they always get your orders wrong their food is overly priced"}
{"text":"It's was good chicken breast portion of my lunch was a little to dry. Probably won't go back but check it out there is a lot to choose from."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with Lo-Lo's and plan to bring every out-of-town guest here. Awesome customer service, delicious food, and overall great vibe. Can be crowded, but for good reason (and always worth the wait).

My husband and I like to split the KK (3 pieces of chicken, two large waffles, grits - get them with cheese for $1 more- and eggs). It's plenty of food for two.

Two very enthusiastic thumbs up."}
{"text":"Pro: 
The food is very good - so good I'd probably put up with the annoyances again. 

Cons: 
I'm seeing this in a lot of reviews about this place - the service is kinda slow. After we were seated, no one talked to us for 15 minutes or so. A nice woman (manager? owner?) came over and asked if anyone was helping us. I said no, and a server showed up after another 5 minutes or so. It was busy, but not crazy-busy. The time between when we were seated and when we got food was about an hour. 

The interior of the new location is beautiful, but it's really hard to have a conversation because it's loud and everything echoes off the hard brick, concrete and glass surfaces. The old location was nice and basic, a good place to hang out with friends and fam. The new place is a good place to sit and yell at each other, and smile and nod when you can't hear their response. \"This place is great.\" \"WHAT?\" 'I SAID THIS PLACE IS GREAT.\" (smile, nod...) \"yeah\" \"WHAT?\" \"YEAH!\" They need some kind of sound control in there. I'm not saying it should be like a library, but I would like to be able to have a conversation. 

Valet parking. Ugh. It is \"complimentary\" but I feel like a cheap jerk if I don't tip the guy for bringing my car from 50 feet away. Wouldn't it just be faster / easier for me to walk the 50 feet and get my own car?

I'm conflicted. I still love the food, but Lolo's has gone from being a simple, friendly place with great food to just another trendy, annoying Scottsdale hangout. That's progress I guess."}
{"text":"Best chicken and waffles in the universe hands down. This spot is always packed. every time im in the valley of the sun i have to stop in. You never know who will be there. The shirts that the the staff wear are priceless....So hood. love this place and the kool aid in the mason jars are the shiz- nit!"}
{"text":"Hubby ate her twice over the Labor Day holiday weekend while visiting Scottsdale. 

The decor looks like a modern take on an old school diner. 

This place is crowded all of the time. Our first visit we had to wait about 15 minutes before we were seated which was not bad. Our second visit we were seated right away. 

On our first visit I ordered 2 chicken wings, 1 waffle and lemonade. Hubby had 1 chicken breast, 1 or 2 waffles (can't remember), french fries (he can't resist them) and sweetened iced tea. 

OK first off this place serves their drinks in 32 ounce mason jars. The drinks are huge! They even allow free refills on drinks. 

The menu said the lemonade is homemade but was watery. My husband's iced tea was better but I prefer lemon juice in my tea. 

The food finally came out and the chicken was hot and tasty, BUT......the waffle was cold, thin and as one other reviewer described it, wimpy! The flavor of the waffle was good but it was cold. My husband said his was cold too! His french fries were also cold and he sent them back. 

Obviously the cook on that day was bit off on his timing of everything. 

Our first visit the service was just okay. Not good but okay. It was a bit slow. 

On our second visit we both ordered the soul food platter which came with 3 pieces of chicken and 2 sides. 

I had collard greens and mac and cheese as my sides and he had collard greens and red beans and rice. 

On the second visit my chicken breast was was over cooked and dry but everything else was pretty good. There were no complaints from my husband who had a very large juicy chicken breast on his plate. 

The soul food platter also came with corn bread that had so much butter on top that it looked as though an ice cream scoop had been used. The waiter was nice enough to bring me another plate so that we could remove some of the butter. 

I knew I was not going to be able to eat a whole soul food platter but there is no other combination on the menu that gives you chicken and the sides without having a waffle which I found a little odd. It did take 3 meals for me to finally eat all of this food. 

Lo-Lo's also has fish, breakfast items ad desserts on the menu. We did not have the opportunity to try them but while were there we saw that other people had ordered them and they looked pretty good too. 

Let me not forget there are also various flavors of kool aid on this menu. 

After speaking with some of the locals about the waffles at this place they told me to always make sure that I tell them that I want the waffle hot! 

I thanked them for the tip but I wouldn't have guessed that I needed to specify that I wanted a hot dish to be hot. Go figure! 

I think we will go back when we are in Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"As much as I love the food and this place. I'm upset that I still can't get an apology or an answer. I went on Monday Oct. 31st, we were not aware they closed at 5pm. So we ended up ordering to go and, they never gave us our drinks that we paid for that day. I called the place No answer & I messaged their facebook. And still no answer. I understand it was closing time and everyone wanted to go home. But I'm upset about my koolaid I never got!"}
{"text":"20 minutes wait time.  Server was great.  Food was fantastic.  Had the chicken and waffles with kook-aid."}
{"text":"We've been fans of Lolo's for years and just stopped by again today for lunch. Seriously great food. We had a chicken and waffle plate, and a catfish and red beans meal. Everything was wonderful, including the service. It might strike you as a little pricey, but they give you plenty of food (the corn bread muffins are a meal in themselves). Always a long wait but totally worth it."}
{"text":"It's legit. Almost always packed because the food is just that good. Fried green tomatoes, Mac & cheese, fried chicken, waffles, and tons more stuff that will make you fat but whatever. It's delicious."}
{"text":"As a certified lover of Southern style cooking especially 'Soul Food' I could not have been more happy with my lunch yesterday. Excellent fried chicken, the sides were dirty rice & red potatoes/green beans. Both excellent -- and not too Scottsdale-ish at all. Example: when ordering green beans in a soul food place I WANT canned beans that are gussied up w/butter & bacon not some kind of certified organic locally grown GMO free super-beans. The cornbread muffin made fresh and you're not going to get those around here like that. Atmosphere busy, urban & clean. Waitstaff was hopping absolutely nobody hanging around texting or socializing because the place is so busy. Yes there's valet parking or around the block but honestly you kinda need a walk after a lunch like this."}
{"text":"Ok first I'm rating this review for the parking here. It's Sunday at noon and, they had the entire parking section adjacent to the building reserved for the hotel next door.  If you need to park, you're forced to use the valet.  I mean hardly anybody is going to the hotel.  It's complimentary valet, but you will feel bad not to tip and the parking is in the front of the restaurant but they blocked it for valet only.

Needless to say we left...too bad the food is really good especially my favorite, Collard Greens."}
{"text":"I had higher hopes for this place, the chicken wasn't well seasoned there was no kick to it. Corn bread was too sweet, the only thing I did enjoy from this joint was the rice with gravy. Overrated! I give it a 2.5."}
{"text":"From the perspective of someone not familiar with southern food, the food here was fantastic.  My fiancee and I had, of course, the chicken and waffles.  They were so good, we visited twice during our short weekend vacation in town.  I wish we had a Lo-Lo's back home!"}
{"text":"Slow, Slow, Slow, open tables, understaffed. Took 25 mins to get drinks. People walking out because wait is long and frustrating seeing open tables. Not efficient at all. Food is good but next time will go elsewhere to get in and out faster."}
{"text":"Amazing best chicken in Phoenix.  Waffles are delicious with a hint cinnamon.  Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Have you ever had food so good you wish you could just put it in a blender and then had it put in to an IV so you could just have a constant supply of it running through your bloodstream?

I have. It happened at Lolo's. 

I don't use the word \"synergy\" often, because anyone who does should be punched in the face, but I'm telling you that chicken & waffles equals more than just the sum of their parts. It's basically a religious experience.

Also the chili cheese friends are amazing and the mac n cheese is the most velveeta-y mac n cheese i've ever had.

not only would i recommend friends eat here, but i think it would be morally acceptable to force you friends to eat here. you should be allowed to use any force necessary to make sure friends and loved ones eat here."}
{"text":"First off I tried to keep my expectations down, love fried chicken and waffles and the reviews are great. I ordered the 3 piece and 2 waffles.  The chicken was good, not great, really could use better spices or more of them at least. I like my chicken with a little kick, not too much but a little would be nice. The waffles, I smothered with syrup and butter and were okay again. They actually were too heavy for me. I had these type of waffle before and they are meant to be heavy but I like my waffles a little lighter. Putting my difference aside, the combination was okay, problem was need a little more salt on the chicken and waffle itself could have been more sweeter. Remember we are going for the salty, sweet combo to really invigorate our taste buds. It did not mine but I would have to say it was good. I think the Louisiana chicken had a little more flavoring and the popeyes definitely had more. I will still go back if I am ever in this part of town to try it again. But it does not live up to they hype."}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's is the standard for chicken and waffles in my book - it sets the benchmark for all other chicken and waffles. Today was my first visit ever to the establishment, and I was not disappointed. 

This is southern-style food full of love and lard, just the way it should be. I ordered the number eight, Betty's Boob (seriously) with a side of cheesy grits. The chicken was crispy and juicy, the waffle was great and not too sweet. My suggestion is to put some syrup on the waffle, get a piece of chicken and put a little hot sauce on top of it - the combination will blow you away. Sweet, salty, crispy and a little spicy, it is simply magical, no other way to put it. 

The grits were pretty fantastic too. I'm a southern girl and whenever I can find grits like this, I have to tell someone about it. Their grits game is on point. All of the other sides looked awesome too - next time I'm coming for the fried okra. 

Five stars for fantastic service and church music playing on Mother's Day. You go, Lo-Lo's!"}
{"text":"I could never imagine myself eating fried chicken and waffles -- not for breakfast, not for lunch, not for dinner . . . but hubby and I were looking for a quick bite (not drive-thru or fast food) on our way back from south Scottsdale.  As I tend to do often these days, I picked up my cell phone, clicked on Yelp and looked for something with great ratings nearby.  Up popped Lolo's.  This worked as hubby wanted something breakfasty and I wanted something more lunchable.

When I think of fried chicken, all I would think of is KFC -- greasy, ordinary batter, yuck!  I was thinking, I better get a waffle and some eggs, or the macaroni, but then our darling waitress (who by the way told me I have beautiful eyes) said, \"I promise you, you'll love the chicken, which would you like, white or dark meat?\"  I picked the drumsticks . . . oooh, and I am a convert!  Absolutely delicious steaming hot drumsticks with a perfect coating of perfectly seasoned batter.  My husband loved his breast and wings equally. 

There are so many choices on the menu, and not just chicken, so even if you are a vegetarian, you can still find something like beans and rice on the menu, or on their list of sides which is enormous. 

The atmosphere is very casual and open . . . and the people are very friendly, which makes it even better. Gotta go back and get some mac 'n cheese since it looked like everyone except us was ordering it!"}
{"text":"Went  there the other for dinner.  The restaurant was packed.  Luckily part of our party arrived early and was able to get a table for 12. As I mentioned the restaurant was packed.  They were terribly understaffed.  Our waiter was working tables all over the restaurant.  It really wasn't' this fault for the terrible service. He was doing his best.  Mgt should have had a lot more help, and of course we never saw mgt., anywhere. 
Took for ever to get anything.....drinks, appetizers , which we later canceled, and  out main entrees.  
When they brought out entrees, they messed up.  Got dinners that weren't ours.  I think we got someone else's entrees, and had to get new entrees for those that were wrong.
Two people in our group ordered appetizers for their dinner...gizzards, fried much rooms, and and zucchini.  The gizzards were not chewy, but mushy!  And the mushroom and zucchini coatings were two different colors.  I got the feeling that those two items were not coated and fried on premise.  I think they got them at Costco Business Center.  They too were soggy, not crispy.
Then the waffles....they were SO thin!  They couldn't have gotten them at Costco.  Even Costco's frozen wafflesg are thicker then these.  
Needless to say.....we won't be back.  One star is for the waiter who was doing his best."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. I was served the MOST AMAZING, Melt in your mouth- \"Red Velvet Pancake\".  I washed it down with a nice ice cold JAR of Lemonade!!! I felt like I was back down South in my Grannies Kitchen. My afternoon was Great after having such wonderful service, and great food........ummmmmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"I will start by saying this is a really tough review to write, but given what happened I feel compelled to warn others.  If you are White I would recommend you steer clear of this location because it's pretty obvious you and your money aren't welcome here.

We went on a Saturday morning.  There were 8 of us (4 adults and 4 kids).  When we arrived we were told it would be about a 30-35 minute wait.  We agreed to wait around.  2 minutes later another large group (7 people, not white) arrives.  I was still standing next to the hostess counter.  She informs them it would be a 40-45 minute wait, glances over at me, and then looks back at the other party and says \"we might be able to make it sooner.\"  I didn't think much of it until I saw a large table open up (about 5 minutes later).  I thought to myself awesome we will be seated in no time after all.  But to my shock they called the party of 7 to be seated.  I politely asked why they went ahead of us, and she boldface looked at me and said only 7 people can fit at that table (there was room for 8 lol).  They waited 45 minutes until a table in the very back corner opened up.  No apologies, no thanking us for our patience.

Quickly afterwards the waitress came by, got our drink order, and returned 2 minutes later with the drinks.  What I noticed right away though is she wouldn't actually look at any of us.  I thought it odd, but continued to have faith it would be a good meal.  I then watched our waitress go to her other tables of people that were seated AFTER us to take their food orders.  She kept visiting those tables but refused to come back to the corner to take our order. (Again we are the only white people in the restaurant)  It took almost 20 minutes to get our food ordered (only 5 plates since our kids don't eat that much and we were sharing family style).  I thought no big deal because I was watching table after table who ordered before us getting their food in 15 minutes or less.  It took over 40 minutes to get our food.  In those 40 minutes the waitress never swung by for refills, or to apologize for the wait.

BUT the next scenario is what helped remove any doubt I had left about the situation we found ourselves in.  When the food finally was delivered, the waitress came by RIGHT AWAY before we had even taken a bite and asked if we needed any to-go boxes!!!!!  I was absolutely shocked and amazed in this day and age, at an established business, this would occur.  Even my kids started asking me \"Dad, why do they want us to leave so bad\".  It broke my heart they had to witness this behavior and prejudice.  I had to wait until we got home to help educate them on how sometimes people will treat you different based on the color of your skin.  It's almost surreal that we just wanted to come enjoy a meal and some amazing waffles, but were then confronted with this crap."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a Lo Lo's after I got off the plane. However I was super disappointed it didn't taste like the original at all. The lemonade has always been a favorite at Lo-Lo's but it was so watered down - didn't taste good at all. The chicken salad had basically 2 handfuls of salad mix with couple pieces of chicken. It was definitely not worth the price.  The mac and cheese was dried up and stuck together. 
The only part of the order I liked was the corn bread even though it was cold. If you are expecting to come here for the experience, you are in for a disappointment! Service was slow and took 20 minutes and they  even forgot my waffle. 

I'm sad because Lo-Lo's would have been great to showcase what Arizona has to offer for tourists at the airport but this particular store def does do not do that!"}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's is FIRE. The chicken was extremely good and the waffle was perfect. Brittany was our server and did a great job. Matthew also helped and seemed like he was happy to be at work and gave me a good laugh (Matthew needs to keep helping Brittany ) Great experience overall. Also the red Kool-Aid was bomb"}
{"text":"This review is for the central location not the Scottsdale location.  I have been to this establishment several times and have not had a good experience yet, but I kept giving them the benefit of the doubt, but last night was the final straw...  One time I went to the establishment to have some of their Red Velvet Cake, before ordering the cake I asked the rude waitress if they had some cake before I even ordered dinner, she replied yes, and guess what after dinner I ordered some Red Velvet Cake for the table and she informed me that they were out and she was sorry, Really!!!!!!   Last night i dropped by and was going to get some Cake for the house and now I guess that they do not do orders to go, just 1 slice of cake really, they are to busy to box up 1 slice of cake.  If you want to have chicken and waffles just go and take the trip to Scottsdale/Thomas southeast corner, no rude waiters and waitress' and the best of customer service......."}
{"text":"OOOOHH Yeah dig it. The waffle hunt continues. KFC my A$$$$. I have been here twice and the service has been great and the staff very friendly. When I was here tonight a lady came in with about 8 kids she had as guests from Korea. She said something strange, She said the kids \"Think they want chicken and waffles\". WTF? She then went on to say the Korean kids eat all kind of waffles in Korea(?) and she was skeptical about the Chicken and waffle thing. (Dummy) So the lady behind the counter insisted on giving them a waffle to try and the Yelp 5 stars were unanimous with the kids so she was ok with the next dinner out would be Lo Lo's. 
Anyway that was a departure from the usual review. I got the 2 thighs and waffle for $7. The Fried chicken is about about the best basic fried chicken I know of. Yes places like KFC have spices, etc, but this is straight forward plain, fried chicken and it doesn't need any thing else to make it top of the line. Krispy fried skin, moist flavorful meat. I can do with out the herbs and spices+the greasiness of some places. 
The waffle, again about the best basic non-Belgin waffle. 
The natural comparison is going to come up with Roscoe's in LA. Well if you remove any stigma/aura around the food, it would be hard to say one is better. The only difference I can tell you is that Roscoe's waffles have a slight malt flavor that Lolo's doesn't. That doesn't count for against either it is just a small difference. And Roscoe's is in LA not PHX."}
{"text":"Avoid the hype! This place is dirty and the food was terrible. Ordered the Betty's Boob which was a waffle and a chicken breast. This was our first visit and the place was not busy. There was an adequate Number of employees in the place as they outnumbered the customers. The place is not clean and the tiled floor was dirty. Upon sitting down at the table and looking closely there was smudges and old food stuck on the shakers and the sauce bottles hadn't been wiped in a long time. Food arrived quickly, but the waffle was not cooked in the middle. The waffles are very thin and taste more like a pancake with cinnamon in it than a waffle. The chicken had been precooked and was not even warm when brought to the table. The chicken is very salty, dry and nothing great as far as spices. The waffle was the worst I have ever had and it is pretty hard to ruin a waffle. Service was terrible as the waitress came by only once right after she served the food. Our drink glasses were never refilled and she was not interested in knowing if we liked the food.  We both left most of our food on the plates as it was not worth eating or taking it with us. The manager should train their staff to clean tables and wipe the items on the table. I am afraid to wonder what the back kitchen looks like since the main service area was dirty. Waste of time and money. We will never return to any Lo-Lo's again. Disgusting..."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and read the bad reviews first as they are dead on for this location. Terrible food, dirty restaurant and poor service. That says it all...."}
{"text":"Thought it would just be a catchy name and never in my life would this the food would live up to it. I was so wrong. 
The food hits your soul and the love they put in to making it shines like a diamond!  
God Bless Lo Lo and her family....absolutely it is worth the wait. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"This place Rocks! Everything is good as far as I'm concerned. Fried Chicken-the best! Greens-the Best! Wings-great! Mac and Cheese-the Bomb! Red Kool-aid is great and the Red Velvet cake was awesome. Service was exceptional.
If you've never been, GO NOW! Word of advice, Go before or after the lunch crowd. It's fills up fast but it's worth the wait. 
When I have friends or family in town this place is always on the list. Thank Gawd for Lo-Lo's, no one else compares."}
{"text":"Okay... I love LoLo's. I think it IS better than Roscoe's. I live for their Red Velvet Cake. I DO love most of their food and usually the service is great... so why the two stars? Because I'm not a fan of THIS location. and here's why...

- The crazy hours. I never know WHEN this place is open, sometimes the sun isn't even set and it's closed and other times I go by and late at night and they're open. It's very inconsistant and frustrating. 
- The loud azz sound system blaring in the background makes it hard for me to hear the person I'm dining with. So usually we just eat in silence while the music plays on.
- The food simply isn't as good as the original location. Everything is a subpar immitation. The chicken is usually overcooked and the waffles lack that certain crunch or crispiness. 
- and my own personal reason - I had hit up Lolos on twitter and said they should have a separate to-go menu and I even said on twitter that we were dining at the counter and it was way facinating to watch the food come from the window. Which it was. I liked it, they were cranking it out and were having a good time when in comes this manager who started barking out orders and basically bullying the staff. I thought it was unfair. and then I got the bill... and was misbilled. I told the waitress who didn't do anything about it and ran my card. I asked her to fix it before running my card - she didn't. I didn't sign my ticket and asked the bully of a manager (who was bald with a tan shirt on June 10th) and then shrugged off my complaint and didn't change it. He didn't even look at it. I was astounded. I didn't know what to do - so I entered my tip and signed my ticket and vowed to never return to the Scottsdale location. oh and before we left, the Bully of a Manager asked me if I wanted a to-go menu, I said yes, thinking it was so serendipidous but when he handed me a regular menu with this shitty look and scarcastic tone he said that THIS WAS their to-go menu... and that's when I knew... he had read my tweets. 

I didn't mean any disrespect, honestly. It WOULD be awesome if they had a to-go or catering menu. There will be feedback from customers. And I don't care HOW good your food is, nothing warrents such rudeness to a PAYING customer. I think success had gone to the manager's head and they forgot how to keep it real - one of the drawbacks of being \"Hood-rich\" as the waitstaff's t-shirts declare. 

To my yelpers I say: Be careful of what you tweet. The manager at the Lolo's Scottsdale location is sensitive so perhaps you should just save your opinion for yelp. And as for the food... imagine you found Lolo's recipe book... and you tried to make yourself a little feast, you did everything EXACTLY as it says, but it misses something... some pizazz, some flavor, some... soul? You will have the Scottsdale location's food down! Stay away from the Scottsdale location. i will keep to the Downtown location where they keep it real"}
{"text":"WHOOOOOOOOOWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!! that's some damned good fried chicken!

hahaha!! Forreally for real though... Ugh.... *Insert Homer Simpson-esque gargling sound here!* 

My cousin and I were spent the weekend being hermits and I got tired of it and offered her some LoLo's, never one to turn down a free meal, she happily said yes. We brought my mom along and were Lo-Lo's bound.

When we got there I saw the lil tent and mini bar of doom. I've read the many reviews warning me about Lo-Lo's 40+ minute wait... but seeing no one standing in the way of the misting fan, we decided to trudge on in... and we were SO lucky to find more empty tables than filled. We sat down in the nice cool mustered colored room, lined with Framed pictures depitcing the Jazz Era... 

We were quickly brought menus and we ordered a round of tea... I had the Half sweet & Half unsweetened tea... my cousin chose the sweetened tea and my mom the chose the unsweetened tea. When the HUGE mason jars hit the table they were excited! I held my own taste test and concluded that Yelpers are always right and that the half & half rules. 

Our waitress was nice enough to explain some of the dishes to us. We ordered and waited a lil while... not as long as I did the first time I went. While we waited and talked the rest of the tables around us quickly filled and we considered ourself fortunate to have arrived when we did. I told them of the warnings about going to Lo-Lo's after church on Sunday... Expect an hour long wait! They whistled and said that it couldn't be that good... 

and then the food arrived...

It was better than I remember it! i chose the Soul-food platter which comes with 3 pieces of fried chicken and your choice of two sides... I chose a waffle and smothered potatos and a large muffin type hunk of cornbread. My mom ordered the same thing but chose potato salad & yams as her sides. My cousin got a pair of drumsticks with a waffle. 

We were all silent for a good five minutes. When we finally went up for air. My mom couldn't believe how good her yams were. She looked like she wanted to cry! lol... and she said the potato salad was great and that the chicken was EXACTLY what she wanted!!  My cousin was inlove with the chrunchy-type crispness salty sweetness of the chicken & Waffle combination. and I, I was about to DRINK my smothered potatos, which are nothing but simply boiled potatos swimming in this basil-thyme(?) flavored chicken gravy that was sent here from heaven!! IT was the BEST gravy I EVER EVER tasted!! I was happily taking a bite of chicken with a bite of waffle and then followed it with a nice perfect smothered chunk of potato... when... when... it was GONE!! ARGGHHH!! When are they going to invent never empty bowls?!?! huh?! WHEN?!

There was nothing but small micro bits of potato swimming in the most amazing grazy... and all I had was a fork... but there... was still some left... and not a spoon in sight, but I could pick up the lil mini bowl.... 

\"DON'T EVEN think about it!\" My mom scolded me while reading my thoughts

DANG! 

I reached a happy medium when I got smart and skewerd a nice piece of chicken and dunked it in the gravy and I was SO back in business!! :D whoo hoo!! It was heaven. pure heaven. 

I know very few things about heaven... I know O'odham Cumbia in Heaven... and I know Lo-Lo's gravy is poured from FOUNTAINS in heaven!! haha.... 

Meanwhile - back on Earth, we devoured our food. I honestly thought I was going to have tons leftover for my lunch the next day... my mom thought the same... no such luck for any of us! My mom was in extacy over her yams that she asked for their recipe... the waitress said she'd ask and quickly came back with: brown sugar, cinnamon & vanilla - boiled and NOT baked... and that's it. And PLEASE let me tell ya'll - she has NEVER ever done that with me before... this woman doesn't like ANYTHING/BODY... and that day, she fell in love with those yams! (Where's my calender?!)

We were laughing and talking about how good the lemonade is (oh yeah - when I needed a refil, I just asked for some lemonade instead of more tea, she did it no problem... she also did the same for my cousin who tried the red kool-aid) and how great the food was when I got a call from a good friend of mine. I told him where I was when he made fun of me and told me to clog my artaries... I made a face and asked him in a rather rude tone if he's ever been to Lo-Lo's, he said no. And then I told him... he'll never get how little I care about my artieries when I'm here until he tries it for himself! Only until you try it do you get how amazing it is...

So simple, so devine. So yummy, so Lo-Lo's."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I came on a Friday afternoon and got a table right away since it wasn't very busy. The service was quick and everyone was super friendly. I got the Lil Amadi with fries, and lemonade. Chicken was crispy and the WAFFLE was amazingly tasty. The menu made me giggle. Contemplated on coming back on my way to the airport but didn't have time :(."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar with my SO.  Great tunes, great energy, outstanding food.  Loved the collard greens, chicken and I had to have a biscuit.  Lovely staff.  Would go there every day if I was close by."}
{"text":"Very good food. Excellent choices on the menu with a wide variety of offerings. Service can be slow and the downtown location could probably scale back the background music as it makes conversing during the meal very difficult.

I initially went thinking it was going to be more show than go, but Lolo's is a very good place to eat."}
{"text":"Love this place! Bring family and freinds here when they come in from out of town. Waffles are delicious and the fried chicken is to die for! The seasonings and spices they use are superb. Plus you can't go wrong with the red kool-aid!!"}
{"text":"I saw \"chicken and waffles\" and my heart skipped a beat.  I got the Tre-Tre's (2 drumsticks and 2 waffles) with a side of greens and cornbread.  The chicken was great, but the waffles were ridiculously good.  Washed that down with a giant Mason jar of tropical punch kool-aid.

The staff was friendly and attentive.  I will caution folks that portions are generous.  Two sides were definitely too much for me, and I had to skip on the peach cobbler that I'd heard so much about.  All-in-all, it was a good experience I plan on repeating next time I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"Bring on the calories! This is the place to go if you are feeling really hungry, or really under-weight. Where else can you get perfectly fried chicken with waffles? Most of the choices on the menu are reasonably priced, and the new design of the place is open and bright. I also thought it was very clean inside, which one would not expect from a restaurant that prides itself on serving neon colored and super sweet cool-aide. 

While the waffles are nothing to write home about, the chicken is fried to perfection. It was tough finding a parking spot, and we had to eventually park across the street. Not knowing if you car is going to get towed kinda made me rush through my meal. The grits left something to be desired - they were dry and had little seasoning. If it wasn't for the huge hunk of butter (which seems to be the only ingredient/condiment that the kitchen used), I would have not eaten the grits at all. Thankfully, the hot sauce made them taste alright. 

Will I come back? Probably, but only after I recover from my heart attack from the last visit."}
{"text":"Great Chicken and Waffles, great servers! I love this place!  All the sides are great bumping Gospel on Sunday Hanging with with my bruh"}
{"text":"Chicken & Waffles...what more is there to say? What a great place and the wait if worth it. Definitely a fan and will be back."}
{"text":"Take two food items which are awesome at anytime of day and build a restaurant around them and this is what you get. I don't think i could eat this fare everyday but when you're in the mood, boy does it hit the spot. The service is very good and the premises is well maintained.  The only negative thing i can say is that they serve pepsi rather than coke."}
{"text":"YUM! But really unhealthy. (duh!) I ordered the Betty Boop (chicken breast & waffle).
The waffles are crazy good, they have a spice I couldn't identify but made the waffle delish. 
I loved the chicken breast but my husband said it was really overcooked and dry. I love dry chicken. 
Back to the waffles; huge scoop of whipped butter, tons of syrup, Huge waffle. 
The boys loved it. They also ordered chicken & waffles. The kool-aid was good but not over the top sugar as I expected. And we brought our dog! We sat outside with her. 
Super  wonderful friendly service. Everyone said welcome, was super nice, from the host, bus service and waitress just welcoming and nice. 
I'm thinking of a five star except I would only eat there on special occasions due to the health factor. 
Screw it - I'm giving them a five as I can't think of a negative.
***Just remembered they ask for your Identification and a credit card before they will serve you. And they hold it until you pay.I found that really odd and unfortunate. Be prepared.*****"}
{"text":"Everything was great. Servings were an excellent size . AND the Banana Pudding is the Bidness."}
{"text":"Ordered a drumstick, thigh and one waffle and a side of collards.  My benchmark is Roscoes in LA and otherwise don't do a lot of soul food.  I don't get the other yelpers but my service experience was fine at 6:45 on a Monday night.   I ordered and had my order in 3 or 4 minutes. Thigh juicy, drum stick not so much, the crust was a bit salty but otherwise crispy, good and not greasy. The typically thin, non crispy waffle I associate with Roscoes or Waffle house - it was fine. Collard greens we were good. Should have been 4 but 2.5 stars is unjust for this place so I'm helping the average."}
{"text":"We ordered a little bit of everything  and it all was a lot of good!  The waffles we tasty, chicken seasoned just right, and the mac and cheese was the cheesiest!  The veggies were delish, but let's talk about the blue raspberry punch in that mason jar!  Wooo!  Yes indeed!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good,the service wasn't that great.I went their with my 4 year old old son and we had lunch,we had the phat azz samich and the trey trey(#10) with lemonade as our drinks.After we were seated it took quite awhile to meet our waitress and place our order-I seen 2 other groups get seated after we did and get there orders were taken first,they also received there orders before we did.Its the first and last time I'll go their,the pricing was ok but if you want your cup filled and your food in decent time don't come here."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying chicken and waffles as a combo and must say that it was incredible! Service was extremely fast and friendly so I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I first called Lolo's to place an order for pick for my lunch. When I called they told me that they were extremely busy and not taking phone orders at this time. I enquired as to how long the wait was if I came down and place my order. I was told 10-15mins. I traveled from south east phoenix to central and Buckeye road location. When i arrived I had to tables ahead of me. I explained that I would like to place a to go order. The hostess proceeded with the customer ahead of me- which was not an issue. After waiting about 15 mins and 5 customers later i asked the hostess when someone would be able to take my order as I was on lunch, she told me that she had to find someone to take my order. I waited another 10 mins, So now I was 45min into my 1 hour lunch and not even an order placed. Needless to say. I left hungry and upset(don't play with my food). They didn't even notice. I called and place a complaint with the manager Mills. I explained everything to him and he gave me his personal cell phone number and told me to call him and he would make sure I was taken care of and that my next order would be on the house. About 2-3 week later I called and tried to place an order. When I spoke to Mills he made several bad management decision 1. He didn't handle my order personally he told me to call the main number and place an order. When I called the told me that they are only taking payment over the phone for call in orders, I explained to them that Mills told me to call and he would be taking care of my order, they said they had to verify this. 2.Mills then got on the phone and began to question me like I had made the whole thing up.  Stating did He tell me that he would take care of my order? Or are those my words? I explained the initial situation and 3. he said he remembers me but doesn't remember stating  the order would be on the house. He seemed hesitant and said well what would you like to order? I replied nothing and hung up. HORRIBLE customer service. I only wanted a Tre-Tre which was $7 (and nothing for me to pay). What a way to lose a customer. I was not out to get over or just cop a free meal. I wanted to know I was valued as a customer, and repayment for my time and gas I spent driving half way across town the last time I visited their establishment. I know that my order would not break LoLo's but their horrible customer service will. Because if this is how the do business I know there will be other customers who will not be returning to LoLo's. My co-workers wouldn't even order form there because of their previous bad experience with Lolo's and now I won't be returning either."}
{"text":"Limited parking but complementary valet. Wait wasn't long on a Saturday afternoon. The server was good. Food was good the only complaint was hubby Double D's were dry. Overall good experience"}
{"text":"First off, let me start by saying that, I LOVE LOLO's, but the customer service and the wait times are sooo incredibly out of hand. I've been here on several occasions, new and old location..even the one downtown several times. But, the wait for the food is the least enjoyable experience. I'm currently in here on a Tuesday evening. We initially ordered the honey hot wings, which are amazing by the way!!!! AGAIN, my issue is neverrrr with the food. The waitress had a stank attitude, probably because she wanted to go home, but if she was attentive we would have been gone 45 min ago! We've been here for an hour and a half, it's 10:30pm..they close at 10pm..smh!!! 

Before we left we ordered the peach cobbler and the banana pudding, both amazing as usual! 

Please someone get a grip on the service here though, please I beg of you. The foods amazing, don't change a thing (WITH THE FOOD..lol)"}
{"text":"The new location is much bigger and GORGEOUS!  It's located on Central Avenue in a beautifully renovated building that Larry and Rasheedah White saved to preserve some South Phoenix history. The new restaurant is right around the corner from the tiny original location that will soon be torn down to complete the new parking lot.  Don't worry the food is as delicious as ever. The setting is now \"Palais du Poulet\" but the grub is hood fo'ever."}
{"text":"It scares me that I could literally eat Lo-Los every day. The Little C combo (2 legs w/ Mac and Cheese) is perfect. Make sure to get the greens and ask for a side of cornbread which is served with a heap of butter on top. Really quick about takeout too."}
{"text":"I love lolos!!!!! I'm in AZ visiting friends and we came here for brunch! Everything was perfect! I wish we had 1 in Dallas."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, delicious food. I've been here more than any other restaurant in Phoenix since moving here a year and a half ago. They've recently expanded their building... now the interior looks nice, too. Parking used to be an issue, but now they have a lot with plenty of space. 

When I asked about the new interior my group and I actually received a mini tour of the place. They showed us the kitchen (we didn't go inside, of course) and other areas. That's going way over what's expected, if you ask me. 

I see a lot of good reviews on their dessert, however I always leave stuffed with a ton of leftovers on even the smallest meals and haven't had a chance to try any. 

PS: Get the \"stupid fries\"."}
{"text":"I've heard that Lo-Lo's was the best chicken and waffles around and this place totally lived up to all the talk. Waited to get seated for 40 minutes but it was worth the wait. They were super busy but the servers were very attentive and friendly. As for the food, the chicken was packed with flavor along with being juicy. I didn't want to stop eating. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This was my second time here. First experience was not great due to having very dried out chicken and waffles. The other night friends I was with really wanted to go here, so I decided to give it a second chance. I wish we ate at McDonald's instead. On a Saturday night I expect them to be busy but still able to function. For our 6 top we waited about 10 mins to be seated. No biggie. Our server was very nice but had an awesome habit of disappearing for long periods at a time. I'm not sure if they were understaffed or she just disappeared. I asked for a tea-which she forgot about. Someone from our group had to find her to ask for my drink after nothing for 20 or so mins. My food was awful. Eggs swimming in liquid and almost ice cold potatoes (Side note if you are going to charge $4 extra for them please make sure they are hot). What was the worst of this was our table waited around 45 minutes or more for our food. When my friend asked her for my missing drink we were informed it would be another 20 mins for food. There's no excuse for this. A restaurant should be able to push out food and not make people wait an hour for food. We would have left had we of not already been waiting and starving. Absolute waste of money. We got there around 7:30 and didn't leave till after 9PM. For a place that has a lot of recognition this should have been a way better experience."}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's makes the best damned fried chicken ANYWHERE, not just West of the Mississipi!! That's saying a lot, but it's true. Their waffles are incredible, too. I love the family feel of the place too and seriously, kool-aid in a mason jar?? AWESOME!"}
{"text":"We had chicken and waffles, as well as the best egg white spinach mushroom omelette my foodie gf ever had...Mike, our server, was the best waiter I've had for months...easily five stars"}
{"text":"When I visit a place for a week I generally only eat at any given restaurant once so I can be sure to try as many places as possible.

For Lo-Lo's, though, I had to make an exception; their soul food is too damn delicious for only one serving.

I'm a big fan of the chicken and waffle combo, and was a regular at Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles former Oakland location. I hate to denigrate the original, but Lo-Lo's takes Roscoe's formula and runs away with it.

First, their chicken is very, very good. Crispy skin, moist interior, just the right amount of spices. My only beef is I wish the pieces were slightly larger.

Second, the waffles are excellent and topped with an enormous round of butter. Just they way they should be. Crisp, dripping with butter, delightful.

Third, the sides... oh, lord, the sides. The collard greens are the best greens I've ever eaten, and I've had my fair share of good ones. Cooked perfectly, no bitterness. They make the south proud. The cheese grits are a bowl of cheesy, well cooked goodness and are not to be missed. The mac 'n' cheese was smooth, and bathing in cheese sauce (and did I detect some velveeta in the mix? oh, I believe I did! And this, my friends, is a very good thing), and the cheese eggs were fluffy and perfectly proportioned between eggs, cheese and onions.

Finally, the red velvet cake is an absolute must-- no matter how stuffed you may be. If I could be encased in the frosting I would die a happy young lady.

My only regret in going to Lo-Lo's was my lack of stomach capacity. Now I'll have to wait a year before I try their fish, peas, and other sumptuous looking offerings.

Word to the wise-- as other reviewers have said, get there early. The folks who run Lo-Lo's are nice as can be and get your food to you in a hurry, but the place is small and it fills up quick. We were in by 10:30 on two separate weekdays and got the last available table both times. Otherwise, you're setting up outside in line. And while Lo-Lo's makes the waiting as nice as possible, with a shade tent and water, who wants to stand around drooling over the smells coming out of that kitchen?"}
{"text":"Why I don't set up a cot and just sleep at this place, I don't know. I have reviewed this place before, but I stopped in a couple times in the last month (yes, I should get my arteries checked). 

Chicken = Fantastic, Mac & Cheese = Fantastic, and the Red Velvet Cake = To die for.

However, I wanted to add something I just had. Stupid Fries. These things are great for sharing. Cripsy fries, topped with a chopped up fried chicken breast, cheese, red and green bell peppers and gravy. They are off the hook good. 

You should go there soon."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to this place after seeing the reviews. The food was intensely mediocre -- why bother."}
{"text":"Really upset the first time we went we gave 5 stars but after today I will never ever go to this place again! We first were seated then 3 other couples were seated approx. 5 mins. After us.... They all got they're drinks before us... I brushed it off even tho one couple was seated right next to me in a booth. Then I asked a random waitress that we were ready to order she said she'll get our server, our server ended up at the table next to us and still after 10 mins. Hadn't even said hello to us! So now I'm getting heated... So finally she took our order fish plate catfish sandwich waffle w eggs fried chicken basket.... We waited and waited for our food the couple next to us finished they're food and we still hadn't received ours...at that point my husband went to the register to ask what's up they said they would look into it. By that time the 2 other couples got there food. Our waitress finally came up and explained to us that fish takes longer (whatever!) She then walks away and the guy that just got his food said loudly that his catfish is great! Wow! So then we get our food but my husbands food never arrives UGH! they never made it! Then the cooks and the waitress start fighting where we ALL can here them in a busy loud restaurant! So finally w no apology he gets his sandwich about 10 mins later! So the worst part happens.... I'm done w my drink and I start to eat the ice and OMG THERE'S A HUGE FLY IN THE ICE! my kids and I were all drinking from it! So I called my waitress and her tone was so bad... As if I freakin put the Damn fly in my drink! I got my kids handed her the drink and left sick to my stomach crying! They didn't even apologize for nothing and still made us pay.... Everything should of been free! They only took off drinks and my meal! Ugh! Never again!"}
{"text":"Talk about urban-chic, this place has it all! They serve Koolaid on tap, Mouth watering waffles and fried chicken that makes my 5 list any day of the week. Did I mention they serve Koolaid on tap?! I'm talking that ice cold sweet Koolaid that mom use to make for you and your friends after a long day of playing outside. Service was extremely attentive and prescriptive with their recommendations. I wish they had one of these in FL, but this is now a must go place anytime I'm in Phoenix for business."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, great food.  For a first visit we expected a long wait, it was maybe a 10 minute wait.  Our party of ten was served in a timely manner.  We enjoyed our time and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time here, n I was really impressed. I went around 11am and they have complimentary valet parking.. The wait was about 25 mins, but the food was well worth it!... Those smothered chicken wings...were 2 die for... I received excellent service and would definitely go back there again.... Well, to be honest.. I did go back again.. The same day for takeout dinner#greedy!!!..  I met Ms Cheryl who was such a sweetie!.. So, if your in town .. Do yourself a favor in stop by"}
{"text":"Walked out before even eating anything.  We got so much attitude from the hostess Deandrea that it really disturbed us.  She didn't say anything to us when we walked up.  She just looked at us when we walked up to her station, no smile.  Eventually I said Hi and 2 please.  She just grabbed 2 menus and walked away.  We followed her to a booth where she dropped the menus and walked away again.  Never once saying anything, no smile hardly even any eye contact.  Very disturbing and lots of attitude.   It really put us in a bad mood and we didn't feel comfortable so we left.   

The valet guy outside was also very inhospitable too.  Again no smile and told us that no one likes to use him so we could just self park.  Granted it's hot out and he's probably not very happy.  

On a side note, out waitress Hilary was really nice and we felt bad about just leaving before ordering.  

Overall for being so close to oldtown, this restaurant did not have a Scottsdale vibe at all with sticky menus, food all over the floor and uncomfortable booths.   I get the whole \"Southern ghetto motiff\" it's going for but this was too much."}
{"text":"We heard things about Lo-Lo's Chicken coming from Los Angeles we thought let's give it a try. Well if you Roscoes Chicken in Waffle this is the place for you. The chicken was just okay, the waffles and French toast were not tasty. Maybe a bad day for the cook."}
{"text":"need i say more... chicken and waffles and koolaide! like seriously the batter is perfection! and those waffles tho."}
{"text":"The food is really good. I love the catfish,  red beans and rice,  mac and cheese,  greens and banana pudding.  The service is decent I love going in the morning when they're not overwhelmed and I can enjoy myself.  Try the smothered chicken,  extra onions and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I heart you Lo Lo's~! 

From every bit of butter on my waffles to the HUGE sweet ice tea .. you have not disappointed me.  I had the best fried chicken with the best seasoning and the servers treat us like family. Always made sure we were taken care of and tummy's full. 

I wished you had better parking ... that is the only reason why I couldn't gave you  5 stars. Wait was about 30- 45 mins but it was worth it to me =)

till next time .."}
{"text":"I HATE the new location. The valet parking is ridiculous and almost pompous. It's a chicken and waffles place in the parking lot of a hotel! Come on! For some reason now the wait is forever to get your food. Both times I've been it was close to an hour after we ordered. I realize too that they are a bit overpriced and now because of the parking and long wait times I told my husband we will find another local southern restaurant. And can the waiters please start wiping off the drinks before they serve them? Our drinks had so much condensation our entire table was wet and there were no napkins until we asked. They need to have those out on the table already. Oh and unless you get a booth be ready for your butt and back to hurt as you sit there in these weird chairs for 2.5 hours."}
{"text":"I had the stupid fries and let me tell you, they were awesome!! The seasoned fries were topped with gravy, chicken, onions and bell peppers. I just wish there was more locations closer to the west valley . But if you're on that side of town you should  go!!"}
{"text":"The food was surprisingly delicious. Surprisingly because, I just had an expectation of \"good\" since the menu was decorated with items that didn't need much to satisfy my palate. I ultimately knew that I was going to be satisfied but the restaurant exceeded my expectations. In fact, my response was displayed by sitting back in my seat after the first bit to regather my thoughts."}
{"text":"This review is mainly about the service. My friend, her young son and I stopped in for lunch. We waited at the host counter for a few minutes before some came up and pointed to a nearby table. No greeting or any kind of conversation- we were led to a table and only given two sets of silverware.

Our waitress clearly did not enjoy her job. She took our orders and begrudgingly brought us drinks. When she brought the meals out she didn't ask us if she needed anything else and she forgot to bring a side we ordered.  

She left - never coming back to check on us. She dropped the bill and brought out a to go box after having had to ask twice. The restaurant was clean and the food is ok, however the service anything but hospitable."}
{"text":"Um, I don't get what the big deal is about Lolo's? I mean the food is good... but if you like chicken and you like waffles then yeah, your meal will be decent. I just don't understand all the hype?

Anyways, I would give this place 4 stars BUT the prices were way too high. We had a pretty fat bill for only 2 people and again, all we had were chicken and waffles. Nothing extra. The staff is also very friendly, but I probably won't be back unless I'm willing to spend a lot on a simple meal."}
{"text":"Breakfast \"sandwich\" was a waffle with scrambled eggs (no cheese when there was supposed to be cheesy eggs) all on one side and the bacon piled on the other side. Not even touching.  The waffles were soft and limp like they had waited for ages to be sent out. Which they had...the family that ordered immediately after me had already asked for their money back for taking too long. 

I waited another 5 minutes for a total of 20 to get my mediocre \"sandwich.\"  In an airport situation you really, really need to let your customers know they can expect a long wait because you have a substitute cook (who was literally asking the cashier what each item was supposed to contain)."}
{"text":"Not bad food. I'd bet that if you're used to their restaurant you'd be a bit disappointed here. 

I only have experienced this airport location and only for breakfast. I get the biscuits, gravy, eggs and toast and after a long flight from the east coast at o-dark-thirty it always hits the spot!  

Service could be faster and the toast always seems a little chewy."}
{"text":"I dined at Lo-Lo's for the 1st time this past Sunday. I called ahead after leaving church to make reservations for a party of 5. I was told our wait would be 20 mins. By the time our party was there & spoke to the girl at the podium. We were told that the person that answered the phone NEVER relayed the message to the person who actually keeps the list & gets the guests seated. Needless to say we waited about 45 mins & watched as several other groups of people who also called ahead were forced to wait among those walking up. Although we didn't mind the waiting; it was a lil discomforting to have that happen. Once we did get inside service was prompt & our order taken immediately. One of our guests did have issues with his order. Apparently he always orders an omelettes & we were told that the person who usually does omelettes was not there so he could not get it. He ordered something else & again it was a no-go. That sucked quite a bit but all in all the experience was fun & I definitely wouldn't mind going again."}
{"text":"Today unfortunately my car was towed at Lolo's Chicken and Waffles. Despite the experience, Gabrielle & Carlos were very professional in handling the situation. They executed excellence customer service and their response made me feel valued as a customer. After all of the car drama, I must say the chicken and waffles were good. Larry you have 2 great people on your staff. Thanks again."}
{"text":"Good service and portions. My Lil sis egg white omelette with chicken was huge. I found a chicken bone in it but not necessarily a bad thing cause it means they use real chicken meat. Mimosa was pretty sizeable too. Lots of options on the menu. They also did very well to cater to a larger party of seven people."}
{"text":"always good. i'm never going back to roscoe's in L.A.! also, try the stupid fries with some kool-aid drank."}
{"text":"Be warned.  A trip to Lo-Lo's will shave precious minutes off of your life.  Ah, heck.  I'm not a health nut and if you're taking a gander at Lo-Lo's reviews, odds are, neither are you.  Take a ride on the unhealthy side and enjoy your meal.  

This morning marked my first visit to Lo-Lo's.  I wanted to hit up the original location south of downtown Phoenix but time dictated I opt for the closer location in Scottsdale.

The restaurant was of decent size and comfy.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  Placed my order and it arrived quickly (easily within 15 minutes).  

I ordered Sheedah's Special which consisted of a fried chicken breast & wing and a waffle and a side of grits.  For a beverage I ordered a Dr. Pepper and it arrived in a Kerr's canning jar.  Nice touch.

The waffle was unique and tasted of cinnamon.  The chicken was outstanding.  Seriously, it ranks as some of the best I've had.  Lo-Lo's should sell the chicken by the bucket.

My only gripe with Lo-Lo's is the ghetto glorification you'll see on the menu and the t-shirts.  A small annoyance that does not get in the way of the delicious food."}
{"text":"Best chicken and waffles their it's in the Phoenix area come here a lots only place to come for chicken and waffles  love the staff very friendly"}
{"text":"Kool-Aid that is ice cold, Perfectly fried chicken and golden waffles...what more that one need in life??  This place was amazing!  I can not wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! My family truly enjoyed. Must try their signature drinks. This was our first time. Wish they were local to us. Something to look forward to when in AZ again."}
{"text":"In town for business co worker recommend this place. I ended up going back for dinner the next day and taking some home... Just really good food"}
{"text":"I've grown up on Roscoe's Chicken in waffles but I enjoyed this place so much more. Plus you don't smell like chicken when you leave Score!"}
{"text":"This place is perfection! After going a few times with my boyfriend, I can see how one could crave some chicken and waffles on a Sunday morning.  Don't sleep in too late though because you will wait if you hit the church crowd.  Don't skip the grits!"}
{"text":"Just about the worst food I've ever had. You have to be stond or drunk to enjoy....

Horrible......"}
{"text":"My favorite Chicken & Waffles spot. I have actually intentionally took a layover in PHX on my way to the West-coast and take a cab with Luggage just to enjoy there inviting hospitality, Food and KoolAid in a Mason jar on tap!!! And now I get word that there's one in the PHX Airport... I'll be there soon."}
{"text":"Ate here for an early dinner.  Had one piece of fried chicken, biscuit and gravy, eggs, and grits.  All were delicious except for the grits.  The grits were a little tasteless.  Good service, good ambience, and very filling."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I went to the takeout counter and ordered my food. It took over 20 minutes for me to get my order. When I got to the hotel to eat my meal (hotel is next door to restaurant) I quickly became disappointed with the meal. The chicken was very dry and tasteless. The macaroni and cheese seemed like It sat a long time in the container and did not taste good at all.  The banana pudding was overly sweet. I wonder if they accidentally added double the sugar.  The waffles were decent.  I ate less than a quarter of my meal before I felt sick to my stomach so I threw it away.  $30 something dollars for this?! I will not be going here again."}
{"text":"I had to travel all the way to Phoenix for some good fried chicken!!  After a super hot day of walking through the Botanical Gardens, the only thing that got me through was thinking about checking out Lo-Lo's and the let me tell you that they didn't disappoint!  The place was packed at 5pm but we luckily got in super fast.  Our table tried a little bit of everything.  The Chicken and Waffles, Fried Catfish, Fried Redfish, Collard Greens, and the Gizzards.  Let me start with my favorite, the fried chicken.  Delicious!!  Perfectly seasoned and crispy.  It's hard to find a place where they put the right seasonings in the fried chicken, but Lo-Lo's got it just right.   A great balance of seasoning to give the chicken some zing and super crispy.  The catfish was great, with a similar seasoning.  Nice big filets and not greasy at all, same goes for the redfish.  The redfish was like a southern version of fish and chips.  I'm not a fan of gizzards, but Lo-Lo's got it right so that they were tender instead of rubbery and how can it fail smothered with gravy?  Let's also not forget the waffle, damn that thing was good, with some cinnamon or something in the batter so that it was just a good without the syrup.  

I'm also an unsweetened tea kind of girl now, but Lo-Lo's brought back memories with their sweetened tea in big mason jars, just perfect.

The service was great as well.  Enjoy the ambiance b/c it was authentic and the people that waited on us were awesome.

I'll be making Lo-Lo's a permanent stop on all my trips back to Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Food was great!! Service sucked. We waited about 20 mins for our drinks and another 15 for food and our server only came over once to take our order. We had about three servers who would bring something over when we asked. Never got checked on once. We won't be going back there."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat.  I was raised on southern food, and this stuff is just like my mamaw used to make.  The honey sweets are to die for."}
{"text":"Very tasty chicken and waffles. Make sure to go when they are busy so you get hot and freshly fried chicken.

Their portions are huge! The first time I went I ordered the KK's, and it was way more than I could handle. The second time around I got the Lo-Lo's and still was barely able to finish it.

All the drinks are served in mason jars.

The staff were all very courteous and friendly, I felt very welcomed."}
{"text":"The staff was so welcoming and warm. The food wonderful, but come with and empty stomach for the portions are a , WOW, size. Visiting Arizona with our children  and we were told we should try Lo Los when I mentioned I like waffles. It was worth the trip. Each of us had something different and sampled each of the dishes (chicken and waffle, red velvet pancakes topped with a really nice lemon sauce plus bacon, pecan/banana pancakes with bacon and biscuits and gravy with potatoes) serves with warm syrup. And, my daughter and brother swear by the special orange soda/alcohol drink topped with crème. Please stop by even the ambiance is inviting."}
{"text":"Absolute worst service I've ever had, I'll never eat here again or recommend anyone to eat here. Very disappointed. Our waiter not only took 30 minutes to get our drinks to us but also forgot to put in our food order. People came in after us, ate and left before we ever even got our food. And to top it off or server ignored us the whole time! Worst dining experience of my life and I've eaten at some pretty bad places. Wish I could give it a big fat 0."}
{"text":"Right outta the gate I love that they bring you huge waters filled with chunky ice and lemon slices! Perfect! 
On to the Bacon Bloody Mary's! I gotta put hands together whenever a restaurant makes a Bloody Mary with real V-8 juice. Thats a nice! Two big thumbs up!
Fried green tomatoes were fried perfectly and I loved the paprika on the dipping sauce. 
#13 with Mac n cheese was delicious!!!!
The waitstaff were friendly, prompt, and very helpful."}
{"text":"I can't really add anything that hasn't been said...Just go there! The wait can be obnoxious but thats a good sign if you ask me.

I always get the same thing...1 thigh, 1 breast (for later), greens, grits and sometimes the mac n cheese. Oh and sweet tea!! 

Just go...NOW"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy coming to Lo-Lo's today was the most horrific experience I've ever went through. After calling several times. I came in for my coworkers & me.  I came in before 1 p.m. I waited until 1:16 p.m. I had to ask for a manager just for them to take my order then was told it would be 30 minutes wait. Not only did I wait 30 minutes I actually waited 47 minutes for the food to come out. I did remind them that I was on lunch more than once. They first overcharged me, if I hadn't looked at my receipt I would not have noticed it. Wben I got to work we discovered part of my order was cold the french fries. I ordered chicken and Waffles and received NO SYRUP. My chicken strips were overcooked dark brown in color. How can you eat chicken and waffles WITHOUT SYRUP?? I tried calling them and of course they don't answer. How and why did I wait sooooo long for cold fries and almost cold chicken strips?? While I was waiting another young woman was also waiting just to order a gift card. She said she had been waiting for 20 plus minutes.  She finally gave up after watching the waitresses go back and forth in the kitchen. I am completely appalled we didn't get any SYRUP for our meal!! We spent $50 and this is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Pathetic! Both the food and service. My order was messed up. Had to return the drink two times and entree two times. Food was bland and tasteless!and this despite a wait time of one and half hour!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend and we had the time of our live the best food and atmosphere. The food was hot our cups are never empty and the people were great I have dreams about how great there food is and it's a place to brag about to your friends people that know this place brag everytime they eat here"}
{"text":"Ok, to start business hours on Yelp are wrong.  Restaurant opens at 8 on Saturdays.  Wanted to try everything so we ordered a taste of it all.  Why not, on vacation.

Good drink selection, love the mason jars, big enough to keep you hydrated without multiple table interruptions.  Server was great, helped us navigate the options.

Kiss My Grits special-  grits cooked perfectly, no lumps.  Added sausage gravy for biscuit and was glad that we did.

KKs-  loved it, unique flavor in waffle, chicken crisp and well seasoned.  

Veggie plate- okra perfect, yams perfect blend on spice and sweet, Mac n cheese - almost as good as mine, greens were divine.  Cornbread was awesome!   

Only caution, butter everywhere, watch your heart.

Had to get Kool aid to go!  Yummy, hadn't had in at least 10 years."}
{"text":"Day two a success.  We were here for a weekend getaway,  ate at PHX location yesterday and found that Scottsdale location was near the hotel so out to explore.  Parking is a challenge as noted in other reviews, but valet a solution so moving forward.  Overall good just as good, service slower.  Loved music even though it was hard to hear.  Lots going on with TVs.  Loved the community table!

Today we ordered shrimp and grits, Chyna wings, and caramel banana pancake.  Also indulged in an Arnold Palmer and Purple kool aid.  Got an order of sock it 2 me cake to go.

Huge homemade biscuit with shrimp and grits was a pleasant surprise.  Shrimp and grits lacked the sauce that is typical of the item.  This item is the only reason that the review was not 5 stars.  Wish I had ordered gravy for the biscuit.  

Caramel banana pancake was on point.   Wow!  Wings were perfect blend of sweet and spiciness, could have an option for a smaller portion with a side because just too much for one person.  Drinks are just like the good ole days, a treat once and a while but certainly not an everyday splurge for indulging.

Service not as speedy so be prepared, but food worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Food is amazing! The only reason why I'm giving this business 4-stars is because they only give tables to full parties. We went to lunch and were meeting somebody there. We were told we can't be seated until the entire party is there and we had to wait. The third person from our party showed up 5 mins later and we were seated at a table that was empty the entire time we waited. I'm sure there's a reason for this policy but I have never experienced that in a restaurant - everywhere else you can sit down and start ordering, even if there are more people that will come join afterwards"}
{"text":"* Chicken was fried to heck and back then to heck and back again.

* Waffles were spongie

* Syrup was watery

* Not only is a bun a sandwich option... it's the only option... cmon guys.

* No need to discern the Lemonade from the Kool-aid amd it's just lemon flavored Kool-aid"}
{"text":"There is always a wait, but believe me when I say the wait is worth it! The food is so good and they have so many different options. The service is great and everyone is so friendly. The experience is definitely nice as well. They have a fireplace outside where you can sit on chilly days, which is pretty awesome! I definitely recommend this place to all my friends and I have yet to hear anyone say they are disappointed. By far, some of the best chicken and waffles you can have!"}
{"text":"I ate at Lo-Lo's today.
I ordered chicken, waffles, and grits
and lemonade in a mason jar
from friendly, attentive waitress.
I was all prepared with Lactaid pills,
and still bracing for the worst for
there was butter on everything.
Everything?
Everything.
But I found out that somehow the heavens shine on Lo-Lo's.
For it's now 4 hours later.
Belly still content.
No adverse reaction
to delicious crispy fried chicken,
buttery waffles,
and even more buttery grits with Louisiana hot sauce.
Nothing going on down there in belly-land.
Nada.
To which I say, \"Kickass.\"
So take that, Denny's.
Lo-Lo's is where it's at (just maybe not everyday)."}
{"text":"Need one of these in Boston.

Great concept. 

I like the different options. 

Fried green tomatoes were very good.

I've had better waffles and chicken. But the gravy made it good.

Staff were great."}
{"text":"very very tasty, nice staff, clean facility, i got there when it was a 45 min wait... but I waited cause I smelled what was inside and oh was it nice mmmmmm"}
{"text":"Luv this place! We always stop by when we are in Phoenix! Great chicken! Nice and crispy and very tasty!! Coming through soon from Cali! Cant wait to get my grub on!!! =)"}
{"text":"The best fried chicken I have ever had!  Just right; spicy crispy outside and the tender juicy inside.  The waffles are perfect with the chicken, too.  

We have been here several times and we are never disappointed.  Friendly employees, very clean, and delicious food."}
{"text":"Place is soooooo good. I love the kool aid, waffles, greens, and chicken. Wish I had room to try the red velvet cake but that never happens!"}
{"text":"Even though I spent most of my formative years in the south, I have never in my life had fried chicken and waffles in one sitting.

I have been missing out!

The chicken was so good, I wanted more despite being totally full. The waffles were buttery, sweet, and yummy. Oh! And the macaroni cheese... *gasp* The sweet tea is VERY sweet. My friend was in the know, however, because he ordered half-regular and half-sweet which STILL tasted way too sweet for me.

The saltiness of the fried chicken mixed with the sweetness of the waffles is an unholy and remarkable combination.

Make sure you get there early because the line is long. However, the service is very good (even if she did serve me last because I was wearing a Steeler's jersey the day they played the Cardinals. It's why  I was in Phoenix). 

I could happily commit suicide by coronary here."}
{"text":"wait was a little long, but worth it!!! I got the tre tre. I'm not sure but I think they put unicorn inside that butter, it's sooooo good. Oh and definitely get the sweet tea, which is refillable for free!"}
{"text":"What better way to recover from a marathon than with killer carbs, grease, and an insanely high caloric intake!

KKs: 3 pieces of fried chicken (southern style that is), 2 waffles, (think flat but plae sized) a bowl of grits (heaping with butter) and a pair of eggs (mine scrambled) with cheese & onions.

Now add in the \"Sock it to me cake\" which was the dessert of the day and you have full entry into 'the itis!\"   All I wanted to do after that was curl up in a ball and sleep!

You can't go to Lo-Los's everyday, wel you could but. . . . But for a once a quarter binge it rocks!"}
{"text":"What can I write that already hasn't?  Excellent all the way around from service, pricing and taste!  This time I had the catfish.  Awesome cornmeal batter and flavorful catfish.  I took a friend temporarily staying in Phx working that's from Montana.  He wants to come back before he leaves.  Oh, and great sweet tea also, not too sugary, just right!!!"}
{"text":"Friends and I tried out the Scottsdale location tonight. I was a first timer. Table for 8. Used the restroom as soon as I arrived, filthy. Sat down,  menus and table were sticky with syrup. Went to order and waiter clearly didn't know the menu. Ordered a glass of wine.  Menu had no prices or selection, four whites four reds.  That's fine! You don't go to Lolo's for the wine. I get it! So I assumed it would be a decently priced house wine. It was $12! If you dine in Phoenix or Scottsdale at all,  you know on average you can get a glass for $9. Ridiculous.  I was robbed. Meal was less than mediocre. Server was sweet but clearly stretched too thin.  Never once got a refill on water.  Cleared our dishes just before we left, probably 15 minutes after we finished eating. One of our guests got his meal 10 minutes after the rest of us,  the other got her fries after she was done with her meal.  Spent over $30 on this meal.  Not pleased."}
{"text":"First time visitor and new AZ resident. Giving it 4 stars because I understand it was Sunday. Many people probably come for brunch but the service was the worst I've had in a while. Food was great!!! Took about 15 minutes before anyone came and took my drink order. By then I was ready to order my food as well. Food came out very quick. I needed extra napkins but the waiter never really came back to check on me until I was done with my food. I paid my bill and it took him a very long time to come back with that as well. Employees didn't seem as though they enjoyed their job very much."}
{"text":"Maybe it was just an off day.  Ordered the Betty Boob w/home fries and beans over rice...First chicken was dry, my home fries came out cold, waffle was mushy but the Kool-aid was on point...I ordered a Red but got Purple, still good tho. Waitress wasn't very attentive this go around. Like I said maybe an off day but didn't enjoy my food."}
{"text":"Ok- chicken and waffles may sound wierd, but so did chocolate and peanut butter before you tried it......MY girl and i went there on 7/5/14 and have been a few times before.  Seriously, i dont even like fried chicken and there's is AMAZING ! Not greasy, the outside is delicious, tender inside, juicy and the waffles are simply perfect.  Threw down some cheesy grits, too. I have wanted to order other things off the menu, but the chicken and waffles is so good, i cant deviate from it.  Plus, they are super efficient and organized.Service is very, very good.  It will be busy when you go, so expect a wait.  But they move people in and out effectively and the place is immaculate.  Probably one of the cleanest restaurants ever."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious!!  I've never even heard of eating chicken and waffles on the same plate, until this place opened up in my neighborhood.  It kind of reminds me of Thanksgiving dinner-with a lot of sweets and meat in the same mouthful!!  I wish it was a little less expensive, since I can make chicken and waffles at home for a fraction of the price, but I have to admit.... my homemade chicken and waffles could never be  NEARLY as delicious as Lo-Lo's.  ;D"}
{"text":"Great food! Arizona's version of Roscoe's chicken and waffles but with more bells & whistles, I had Oreo waffles!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a thousand stars I would this place is past amazing the food is so so good the atmosphere it's wonderful I love the music selection it makes me feel right at home not to mention the blue kool aid is to die for I would highly recommend this page if you looking for great food"}
{"text":"I wish I could just say \"It's Lo-Lo's!\" and you'd understand that meant it was the best, but I guess at least one person hasn't been there yet (for some reason) so I'll expand. The menu is hilarious, the decor is adorable, and everyone who works there is polite and has a great sense of humor. It's soul food, solely for  your soul, foo(d). Everything is seasoned just right and cooked to perfection, and where else can you find at least four flavors of Kool-Aid on tap? (They even let you mix them.) Every time I go I get something different, and I've yet to be disappointed. I even like their takes on foods that I don't normally like at all. Definitely one of the best chain places I know of."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, and great music! I ordered the Toy-Toy and it was amazing. Chicken seasoned to perfection. When I come back to visit Scottsdale, I will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I had never had chicken and waffles and tried my first at the LoLos inside the Phoenix airport and was instantly hooked. The spices they use to fry their chicken are phenomenal, every bite has so much flavor. I am personally a fan of the chicken breast and get my waffle extra crispy which is a must. 

Also, get the Kool aid most of the flavors are amazing. Didnt give them 5 Stars due to the fact that sometimes I have to wait forever to get my food and others they forget to make my waffle crispy and personally cannot handle the soft waffle  but that's just me."}
{"text":"Tip:
1) Arrive early to avoid the wait!
2) We came in 20 minutes after they opened on Sunday and we were seated right away.

3.5/5 solid stars

I ordered the follow items:
1) KK's: 3.5/5 good, but the grit and butter was so bland...it need something else. 
2) LoLo: 3.5/5 good. The fried chx pieces were really good, but the waffles would use some more crunchiness. It was pretty flat.
3) Biscuit and gravey: 4/5 pretty tasty! 

Overall, good. I would come back if I am craving for some soul food!"}
{"text":"Not so thrilled by Lolo's. Have been here three times and yesterday was the first time we had a nice waitress. The wait is always over 40mins, so don't go with a hungry stomach. The chicken is good if the cook that day is good. I have had super dry chicken and also good chicken. Other than that their other dishes are eh. Not worth the wait or the money."}
{"text":"I had never heard of such a combination - and I love both.  I went to the Scottsdale location on Thomas Road and Scottsdale Road.  Service was really organized and the server was very helpful because it was the first time I had ever been there and a friend of mine suggested it.    I would recommend this place to everyone that likes chicken and waffles!!  :)"}
{"text":"Man this is my spot! If I was ballin and worked out everyday, I would eat here everyday.

I first fell in love with Chicken and Waffles during my frequent visits to the LA area. I always had to visit Roscoe's without fail. For some reason I had no idea this place existed for the longest. 

I seem to remember Lo-Lo's having a pretty good sized menu but it never matters. If it only had one thing on the menu that would be good enough for me! 

I still have yet to go to the one in Scottsdale even though I'm walking distance from it, but the downtown Phx location just seems so authentic. One of these days when I have an extra $20 in my wallet I'll bike over to their Scottsdale spot and see if it matches up. 

Either way, if enough reviews haven't persuaded you yet to be adventurous and try this awesome mix of food, you should stop using Yelp because you're doing it wrong.  

Protip: Get it smothered. Your getting enough food to give yourself a heart attack already, why not add some gravy and onions. You'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"This place is overrated. I don't understand why people like this so much. My server got our order wrong, and charged us for the food he brought by mistake. Terrible service. I will not go back again. The chicken is on par with Church's and Popeye's at best."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch. First impression, not a fan of gospel music cranked up so loud you had to use sign language to place our order.  When the \"waffles\" arrived, we had to look twice.  So very thin, I thought there must've been a mistake in the kitchen or they ran out of batter.  An  Egg-O is thicker.  Save your money, or better, save your hearing."}
{"text":"I am giving Lo-lo's 2 stars because I love their food. But I am sitting in Lo-lo's right now..and we're still waiting on our food going on 30 minutes without anyone checking on us. I hope it's just an off day for them but this is so upsetting because I brought guests from out of town. I raved about this place. Bad first impression Lo-lo's....."}
{"text":"My family and I went on Sunday evening because this momma had some pregnancy cravings and Lo Lo's did not disappoint. I use to go when I worked downtown so seeing it remodeled this place not only has great food but I love the new(ish) look! Our server Victoria was great and very thoughtful for my 1 and 3 year old daughters needs. Little things like that make a great experience."}
{"text":"I'm an old school southern man at heart and was pleased to see they had fried gizzards on the menu. Between the gizzards and the fried catfish I'm a huge fan!"}
{"text":"Went to their new location this evening. Had a difficult time finding parking first of all. We walked in and there was blaring club music. Very loud part hip hop songs playing which was totally odd. The decor was all modern compared to the southwestern and homey style of their previous location. First they sat us at a oddly long table to where we had to sit next to each other and hope no one was seated at the bar stool next to us. We asked to be seated elsewhere because it was not comfortable to sit there. We ordered the fried okra, whipped potatoes, potato salad and two cornbreads (she placed them on the table and left and we were left with no silverware) came out about a good 5-8 min before our main dish arrived. The sides were blah and our waffles were soggy. Nothing like the old lolo's. Very very disappointed in the whole experience. Loud music, decor doesn't go with lolo's theme, and the food sucked. They get one star for the mason jars."}
{"text":"Every Lo Lo's is great food and atmosphere. This is a very nice one."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by people at work so checked it out yesterday, and I was not disappointed. I started off with the richest, most moist Red Velvet cake I've ever had. Was so rich, that I only was able to eat 1/3rd of the slice. I went with the \"Betty-Boop\" plate which consisted of 1 breast and 1 waffle. Perfect portion. 
I'm no master chef, but I believe I tasted a bit of cinnamon or some kind of spice in the waffle- it was very delicious. The fried chicken was my favorite part if the meal. I took advantage of the Chile vinegar as well as the Louisiana hot sauce. 
I also love they serve Kool-aid here. The prices are decent- not too cheap, not too expensive.  Overall, I would love to come back and would recommend this place to anyone who likes some good fried chicken."}
{"text":"All I can say is OMG. This was soul food from the heart. I got a nice plate of food and the service and price was spot on. Our server Matthew was the best. He took great care of us. He made us feel welcomed."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time and the experience was way different from the first one. This time the service was bad, slow and not friendly. The quality of the food was also not really good, the chicken looked burned and I asked for a specific cook method and it was not followed. I am not sure if I will cone back."}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's is exactly the sort of place which explains the reason I love Yelp. As a tourist in Phoenix, I would never have found this place on my own but as a fan of fried chicken, I'm so glad Yelp pointed me in its direction.

Lo-Lo's is a small restaurant on a side street with street parking. It has a real mom and pop family atmosphere as you walk in.

As I wanted to try the famous red velvet pie for dessert, I limited myself to trying the fried chicken and waffles, which sounded an odd combination to a British palate. Well, the fried chicken was great but not the very best fried chicken I've ever had. The waffles were nice but I'm still not 100% sure they're the best fit for fried chicken. There was so much else on the menu I wanted to try but my stomach had no space left. The red velvet cake was nice and sweet but the portion size defeated this British stomach!

The staff kindly offered me a free Lo-Lo's T-shirt when they found out I had come all the way from London. Main disappointment is that I missed Shaq on my visit!"}
{"text":"Is it possible to get good food at an airport? Answers on a postcard please

Well, if you're at PHX, it surely is! Lolo's chicken and waffles are famous in the Phoenix area and a recent refurbishment at the airport has seen them open a branch here in the pre-security food court

The girlfriend and I were in the mood for chicken so it worked out perfectly. 2 thighs and a waffle for $7 perfect for British appetites and prices

Having just had KFC, the benchmark the night before, we were in a good position to compare! The chicken was amazing. Super crispy yet moist on the inside. Top class

Only downside was that the food took 30 minutes but the manager Sean graciously comped our meal"}
{"text":"Five stars because there aren't ten!  The chicken is crispy and tasty!   Try the collard greens, the mac and cheese, the corn bread!!  I have it on good authority that this is authentic soul food at its best, not as good as granny's, but nothing ever is!  There are several locations so finding the best place to eat is easy.   If you don't believe it, prove me wrong!!"}
{"text":"My first review after several visits. I love the food here, especially the chicken and sides (greens, okra, mac & cheese) but my dinner was ruined by the very unprofessional manager. I have never witnessed anything like this in a restaurant... Wait--one time at a car dealership that I also vowed never to give my business to again. An employee gave notice and was saying good-bye to her coworkers, very subtly. He came and asked her to leave or he would call the police--seriously??  In front of people eating dinner. He came out a second time and asked her if she would leave on her own or he had to bring the police. I would not have known she had given notice had he not made a fuss. It was that subtle. Seems like overkill and extremely unprofessional to humiliate her in front of patrons. I can't say I blame her if this is how he treats employees. I even spoke on her behalf and he was rude to me--a paying customer. Of course he never apologized and went back into his cave. Get rid of this manager."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try out Lo-lo's because I had heard a lot of good things about it...but I was not very impressed.  
We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was very crowded..which I normally don't mind if the food/service is amazing. Had to wait 45 min to be seated.  
I ordered the Lil C (two drumsticks with a side of mac and cheese) and a side of string beans and potatoes.  The food was not what I would call very good...chicken was pretty dry and very salty.  My string beans were never brought out and I had to ask for them twice.  the service was pretty poor.....I won't be returning......"}
{"text":"Pretty much the most amazing chicken and waffle experience I've ever had.

I went to LoLo's with Robert and Bacon on a Sunday morning. We were only made to wait for a short time before we entered the shrine of soul food. We were greeted very warmly and asked what we wanted to drink. I had the sweet tea. I usually LOVE sweet tea but they were not messing around! Next time I'll order 1/2 sweet and 1/2 regular tea. For my meal, I got the 2 piece and a waffle. We chose several sides to share between the three of us. We had the red beans and rice, mac and cheese, collard greens and fried okra. 
I was amazed when the food arrived at the table. The waffle was hanging off of the side of my plate and smelled like heaven probably should! I tried the fried chicken and I was taken back to my childhood. The chicken was well seasoned and has a bit of baking powder bite to it! AMAZING. It wasn't at all greasy or soggy in any way. My mouth is watering just typing this review. In the background, there was great gospel music playing so I hope that getting a dose of Jesus while eating fried chicken might banish any of its artery clogging properties.... yeah.... 
We were checked on several times to see if we needed anything and we were treated cordially. I will visit LoLo's any time, any day as long as someone is there to share the guilt with me!"}
{"text":"every time i visit Arizona, i have to visit LoLos. i always end up getting koolaid with chicken and waffles. the food comes out perfectly and crispy. i would also recommend the mac and cheese or fried okra. these compliment the meal very well. the environment is fun and for the most part it's very clean, parking may be the only problem you might run into."}
{"text":"I've been to Lo-Lo's couple of times now and I really don't understand the big fuss is about.  I think the food here is very average.  The chicken is ok, I personally think Popeyes Chicken is better and the waffles are plain waffles, something that you can get in any breakfast place.  The catfish was decent, but nothing to rave about.  One thing I will say is the sides are really good.  The mac and cheese and collard greens were flavorful and delicious, only drawback is, its served in a very small bowl, so you don't get much besides couple of bites.  The corn bread was good, but how could it not be, there was about a 1/4 lb of butter sitting on top of it.

One thing that did irk me was, I felt like they wanted us out of there as soon as possible.  It was a little busy and I understand they want to turn tables, but we got our check literally a minute after we got our food.  I noticed the waiter would walk by and look at the check, and hope we were ready to pay, but since we weren't even finished with our meal, I refused to give them my debit card.  I had to ask several times to get my drink refilled and the 2nd time I asked for a refill, they put it in a go to cup for me as if they were ready for me to take it to go.  It's seriously uncalled for.

I'm not a fan of this place, but fortunately for them, my girl really likes this place.  I bet if more places served Chicken and waffles, it would generate more competition, and I'm sure this place wouldnt be as busy, cause the food is really nothing special."}
{"text":"this place ROCKS. Fabulous service, food, dessert.... parking kinda sucks but Id walk a mile for this comfort food! The open windows in the front are such a huge selling point. You can actually see the clean kitchen you're eating from, and watch the home made desserts being crafted. Keep up the amazing work guys!!!!"}
{"text":"If you've never been here before, get the Lo Lo's. It's big and delicious. MAKE SURE YOU EAT YOUR CHICKEN AND WAFFLE TOGETHER IN THE SAME BITE! 

None of this one at a time. They're meant to be eaten together. You'll thank me."}
{"text":"Friday night dinner. No wait. Great food and wonderful service. I had the \"tre tre\" 2 legs and a waffle and some yummy cheese grits. Fun cocktails some are made with their signature kook aide! Great prices too. My reason for 4 not 5 stars was the required valet parking. It seems like most places have gone to requiring valet parking and it seems silly and unnecessary and adds another $5 to the deal."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp about 4 years ago. We loved it. Everything we ordered was tasty and hot. Second visit 3 years ago our appetizer was cold and food came out the same way. So today we thought we would give them one more try. We waited 20min to get seated as it is always busy. It took over 10 minutes before we saw our server. We ordered fried green tomatoes immediately. 20 minutes pass and no appetizer. She then comes by and says \"you ready to order?\" I said no where are the tomatoes? She stated oh well there still cooking they will be here and her attitude just changed as if we were bothering her BC we had not ordered.. Another approx 8 min later she brings out the worst looking tomatoes I've ever seen. The tomato was about 2 1/2 in in diameter an almost burnt and get this, I took a bite ...cold..I mean not even warm. I told my hub \"that's it!!, we are out of here\" I was so upset. All the food that we saw coming out of the kitchen looked good and boy I was just so looking forward to the chicken. Never again. We know how long it takes to get food, I just do not understand how it took so long and to just get cold food. Totally frustrated. I do not think getting hot food is too much to ask."}
{"text":"Both times I have been there i never got to eat. I couldn't wait long enough. There appears to be no management and the kitchen definitely doesn't have it together.
I mean come on, it's only fried chicken and waffles. I can't take waiting 40 minutes for food ---and this is after waiting to be seated and ordering. 
If you're hungry go someplace else."}
{"text":"I'm teetering between a 4 and a 5 on this one. I went for the first time yesterday and I was IMPRESSED. The restaurant was cleanly but still had an awesome downhome feeling. The hosts/hostesses and all of the wait staff was accommodating and always made sure to check back in or explain menu items. The menu is full of delicious Southern entrees that make it difficult to choose. I plan to make this a regular spot (but not too often don't want to pack on those extra pounds!) LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"If you want a heart attack on a plate then this is the place to go. The food is decent and I do have to say the biscuits and gravy and the fries are pretty yummy along with the salad which is the ONLY healthy option. The staff is friendly but the thing that gets me is they have plenty of high chairs for kiddos but NO kids menu or changing station in the bathrooms. Really? Makes no sence. If you like chicken and waffles and kook aid then I guess you'd like this place."}
{"text":"Went Saturday morning with the whole family.   Excellent food!  Loved the waffles with pecans, the gizzards and most importantly, the fried chicken!  Server was great very personable and friendly.  Amazed me he took the order from a table of 6, did not write anything down and everything came back as ordered!  Wish they had a location closer to Gilbert."}
{"text":"I would love to write a good review because I've always loved Lo Lo's however...
This is the first time visiting their new location in Scottsdale and I could not be more disappointed.

The parking situation is just stupid.  They share a parking lot with a hotel and very few spots were available to the restaurant.  They offered complimentary valet parking but at 5:00 on a Sunday evening they were shutting that down. 

My husband & I were shown to our table quickly which surprised me and then we sat and waited. 
If you don't want alcohol or their famous Kool-aid your left with unfiltered tap water. Any one from Arizona knows that tap water is just plain nasty. We placed our orders and waited some more.... an hour into it I was wondering if they would ever feed us when my husband's chili and my two side choices finally showed up. 
We waited...
We asked and were told husband's fries and my chicken would be right out.
We waited...
Husband ate his chili and my beens and gravy got cold. I sent them back. The server apologized and said our food would be right out. Husband's fries showed up. My sides showed up, again, had to ask for the chicken and waffle again, and then I had to ask for syrup. 
The chicken breast was all skin, fat and bone I got 3 bites. The gravy was nasty but the beans were good.
Husband said his chili was good and the flavor of the fries covered the nasty tasting water.
We complained to the manager about how disappointing the whole experience was and he apologized while making excuses that when you come to Lo Lo's a long wait is expected
I said we would be going to the Gilbert location from now on and the manager said \"Oh that location is even worse\" Really?  Great endorsement.  

Parking is a mess, food sucked, staff helpless, management is a joke."}
{"text":"Horrible experience today my daughter found a finger nail in her waffle, and it had to be in the waffle batter. I will no longer return to this place. This place doesn't even deserve a star"}
{"text":"Pretty unbelievable treatment.

I was blown away at the snarky and down right RUDE attitude of one of the employees, possibly the manager.   I had supported Lo Lo's as a local business for years, even before they went all corporate.

Well this visit was quite different.  

I kindly asked this man, who may have been the manager, to turn please turn down the TV volume.  Immediately he told me \"take your phone and go outside\".  I said it had nothing to do with my phone, and that he had quite an attitude towards a customer. He then continued to tell me why he was NOT going to turn it down.  

I cannot and will not support a business that treats it's paying customer with such disrespect.  He obviously has some chip on his shoulder.  Not to mention that the food is grossly over priced now that they are a franchise type entity.  $12 for a ham omelette.  I can go to the 5nDiner and get better food and better service at a cheaper price."}
{"text":"Love this place so much!! Sometimes it can be slow service, but overall the wait is worth it for the delicious Kool-Aid, sweet tea, grits, and waffles!"}
{"text":"This past June 2015 I ate at Lo-Lo's in Phoenix and their Scottsdale location.  I love their friend chicken wings.....Oh Boy!!  Can we say finger lickin' good.  
I had heard so much about this Southern food style restaurant from friends that I was so excited to finally check it out!  
The Phoenix location is very nice with great ambiance on a weird lifeless street.  The restaurant offers valet parking (at both locations) which I was surprised since its not in an upscale neighborhood The Scottsdale location is next to a hotel).  There's a separate attached space for happy hour and special occasions.  The restaurant clientele was a sprinkle of every race your could imagine.  They play the latest R&B and hip hop (kind of loud at the Scottsdale location) for your listening pleasure.
I was so excited to get inside and sit that I ordered a little of everything; chicken, buttered corn, potato salad, collard greens, cat fish and stupid fries (yes, that's the name - smothered yummy!).  We also tried to sweet Tea (not the Kool-Aid) served in a mason jars.  The food is good and reasonably priced.  Customer service was top notch and did I mention the Chicken....Finger lickin' good!!"}
{"text":"I was really apprehensive to try LoLo's again after the big overhaul... afraid that it would lose the quality and charm that made it something special... Boy was I wrong!!!

The food is amazing.  Fried chicken perfectly seasoned, juicy and crispy! Mac & chee, waffles, green beans all cooked to southern perfection! 

A giant mason jar of blue kool-aid is the ultimate accompaniment  in my opinion, but they now have a wide range of alcoholic bevvies to wet your whistle if you prefer.

Chef Nicky stopped by our table twice to personally ask us about how we enjoyed our food - nice touch!  (And this is just one example of the spectacular service that we experienced the entire time we were at LoLo's!)

This place is rockin! I can't wait to show it off to out of town guests and local friends alike!"}
{"text":"Okay this was our first visit to Lo Lo's and it was awesome!! My hubby wanted to try it so we headed down from up north about 45 minutes away.. Got there and waited another 45 minutes to be seated but as soon as our butts were in the seat we were treated like family.. Our server Danielle was very attentive and took very good care of us. We got the chicken and waffles because I believe if the place is known for their chicken and waffles then just go with it. We were not disappointed... The chicken was crisp, moist, and delicious. The waffle was thick and soft with just a hint of nutmeg. We also tried the Caramel Banana Pecan Pancakes and I have to say these were the highlight of the meal so tasty and the caramel maple syrup they pour over them Is to die for.. I wish they sold it to go.. All in all expect to wait to be seated but then enjoy being treated like family.. Lo Lo's we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Can never go with with the #3 LoLo. Very filling, great taste and a reasonable price. Definitely recommended to out of towners. Being from Chicago we don't have many chicken and waffle places."}
{"text":"Wow...words cannot express how amazing the food was here! I cannot wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Lo-Lo's several times since it's just down the street from where my boyfriend works, and it's a great experience each time. The food is wonderful, juicy chicken and perfectly fluffy waffles - and of course I always have to get a side of mac & cheese. Even the Kool-Aid is fantastic, and thank goodness for free refills because I'll easily go through at least 3 glasses of it. The service is excellent and always friendly, and overall we are never disappointed!

The only complaints I've ever had, albeit minor ones, is that sometimes the mac & cheese comes out a bit cold - like they just scoop it out of a big pot that's been sitting out for a while and isn't warm anymore. The taste is still good, so not the end of the world. And a couple times when it's been busy the servers get shuffled around a bunch so we might need to give our order twice and one time they forgot an extra waffle my boyfriend ordered, though it was quickly fixed. Still one of my favorite restaurants to visit when I need delicious and satisfying food!"}
{"text":"I was pretty skeptical about coming here. I heard this place is good from many friends, but I never saw what was so special about chickens and waffles until today.... It is one of the best creations that has ever existed in the food world!! Our wait was about 50 minutes (I've waited longer for dim sum at Great Wall so this was no comparison). Haha. The outside of the restaurant looks a little run down, but I believe that is the look that the restaurant is going for. The inside was very upbeat and comfortable. The restaurant was packed and the servers were really busting their butts to serve everyone. 

Since this was my first time there and I didn't know when I would come back again, I decided to order more than I could eat just to get a taste of everything. Promptly after we ordered, our food came out. My boyfriend ordered the \"Yo Mamma's Biscuits and Gravy\" with a side order of chicken thigh. I ordered the Betty's Boob, Mac and cheese, corn bread, and banana pudding! Everything was amazing! The chicken was very lightly battered with delicious seasoning and deep fried to perfection! The inside of the chicken was still moist and fully cooked. You can't get that at many restaurants! My cousin ordered their fresh lemonade in a jar and I have to say... It was the BEST lemonade I ever had! It wasn't like the Minute Maid crap that makes your mouth gritty and feels like the sugar is decaying away at your teeth. This was freshly squeezed stuff! 

Overall, the experience was amazing! Our servers were friendly, prompt, and attentive to our needs! You can bet that I'll be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"The staff was so welcoming from our entrance till our exit! An older gentleman sat us down and joked with us, he also followed up later to make sure everything was going good. Our server was alert of any needs our table had and was on top of things! He also checked up on us frequently. Our food came out less than 10 minutes after ordering -- Uhm??! Amazing!!! Especially since we were so hungry. I thought we'd be waiting a lot longer since it was a little busy when we went in. I got \"Tre-Tre's\" which was two crispy chicken legs and a beautiful cinnamony soft waffle with warm syrup. I also got a side of creamy mac n cheese, which was the BEST mac I've ever had!!!! My husband got some honey wings with Lo-Lo's hot sauce. I loved the balance of flavor in them! Also, they have great home made drinks, soft drinks, and tons of kool-aid served in huge mason jars! Just go visit this place!!! Like, now!!"}
{"text":"My workplace had a catered dinner from here.  The two employees were courteous and did their job well.

Waffles: Loved the cinnamon.  Syrup tasted like lower quality (corn syrup) stuff.  Very fluffy and soft though, and I personally like a crunchy exterior with soft interior for my waffles.

Chicken Strip: The coating could've used a bit more crunch, and the interior was a little dry

Drumstick: Not mind blowing but quite good.  Crispy skin, moist interior.

Macaroni and cheese: I did not like this despite others raving about it.  Not a fan of the creamy velveeta-like style."}
{"text":"We have been going to Lolo's for a while now. The first time I went I thought wow that's a little weird but I had the food and I was completely amazed. The chicken is some of the best around and waffles are some of the best you'll ever have. The ambiance is really cool as well. The staff is always very friendly and the place is always clean.  My only complaints is $15 is a little pricey for a plate of chicken and waffles. Also it's always so busy you don't really get the service that they I think they are trying to give you. Another thing is they have a manager or owner or something that just kind of stands in the back with his arms crossed just staring at everybody.... no smile nothing just very uncomfortable.... All things considered I really do love this place and I will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Very friendly, warm atmosphere.  We went for breakfast after hiking Camelback.  We figured we'd earned some fried chicken after making it to the top in 85 degree weather.  The food was really good.  Everything looked great! We got one of the breakfast specials - biscuits with gravy, 2 eggs and potatoes and I got 2 pieces of chicken with one waffle.  For once we didn't need any take home containers!  We ate every single bite which is very unusual for us.  I have to go back to get some more chicken and waffles but need to be sure I try the mac and cheese which I saw so many people enjoying and I need to try an order of their grits."}
{"text":"All chicken dinners should start out with a side of waffle, don't you think?

A group of us went to Lo Lo's on Saturday night before the opening of Arizona Theatre Company's AIN'T MISBEHAVIN'. We figured dining on soul food would be a great precursor to the amazing music of \"Fats\" Waller. 

The service was super-quick (although, it WAS quite early. We were there at 5:30 PM). Our friends who are regulars recommended spouses sharing the Soul Food Platter. I thought that was a good idea, but my husband said, \"Next time, I'm getting my own!\" 

We started off with a waffle - yum - and then got our fried chicken (which I never, ever have, so that was a real treat), grits, cornbread, and mac & cheese. 

OK, this is bad ... I'm getting hungry thinking about our food from last night. I think that's a sign that we will need to return sometime soon. 

A note about credit cards: They informed us that they would not accept more than 2 transactions per party, which was good to know. Luckily, most people had cash, so we only had to have them run one card. Just be aware, as people are so used to handing over multiple credit/debit cards these days."}
{"text":"Love the cheese grits!  OMG they're to die for.
Of course the chicken n waffles are fabulous.
My 24 year old daughter loved the Kool-Aid on tap.
The service is ok, could be better. but the food is worth the trip."}
{"text":"hey, guys, this place is goood, food, tasts amazing, envieoment is good too,,  nothing wrong with this restaurant , YOU WILL NOT LEAVE HUNGRY FROM THIS PLACE,,  

the only thing i would say issss, pricing is a little complicated ,,, other than that  i love the place,"}
{"text":"Been a while since we had great fried chicken so decided to meet a friend at Lo-Lo's.  The restaurant shares a parking lot with the hotel and there were very limited spots, so you have to use the valet service.  The restaurant inside looks like a fox concept.  It definitely looks more like a chain which I didn't expect.

We both ordered the soul food special, 3 pieces of chicken, two sides, and corn bread.  Verdict?  The chicken - all dark meat -- was dry, the skin was crispy to the point that it was hard, and the meat lacked flavor.  Very disappointing.  Honesty, would have had better chicken at Popeye's, Church's, or KFC.

Sides were good, corn bread was flavorful, and service was great.  Main ingredient - fail."}
{"text":"This place is decorated so nice. It was a bit of a wait but it was worth it. My chicken was very delicious and the red cool air was good, just too sweet for my taste. Overall, great prices and great food."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, the food has been fantastic each time. However, I'm giving it such a low score because of the service my second time around. If you want quality service avoid having Steve as your server.

As I sat down this 2nd time around, mind you after I had been seated by the host, my server comes up to me and asked if I sat myself down. I responded kindly and said I'd been seated by the host. Steve's response, \"they sat you out of order.\" Then proceeds to walk away say it's alright. Now, I normally wouldn't care about stuff like this but when your server makes you feel like you made a mistake  it's really sets a negative tone.  Even so I let it go. 

He returns, takes my order, delivers my drink and the. I don't see or hear from him for 25 mins or so until he brings my meal. However, he proceeds to tell me to take my plates off his arm, mind you they're very hot, and I don't know which plate to take first because I don't want to cause him to drop anything.  Then he leaves and not once does he check on me or offer a refill. 

As I'm getting ready to go, I had to ask another server for a to go container. Steve finally shows up only to had me a $30 bill. I give him a card and for some syrup to go. He brings me back my card and said he'd be back with my syrup and then never returned.

Again, I'm usually very understanding especially when a place is busy but this really left me with a very negative feeling about this place. 

I will have to say other servers were more attentive to their customers."}
{"text":"This was a great Sunday dinner experience.   The decorations set the stage for a down-home feel.  The food is cooked to order and was served fresh.  Our server was fantastic.   Plan to walk home after consuming the menu classics."}
{"text":"Outstanding service! Exceptional food!  Fantastic enviroment!  You guys treated my guests and I like royalty. Make sure to visit Lolo's, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I've been to the original location on Central & this is head & shoulders better just with sheer space alone. Much easier on the eyes & the same great chicken & waffles. I'm glad this Phoenix staple is surviving & thriving. Keep it up Lo-Lo's. Nothing but love from me."}
{"text":"Love the fried chicken. It's one of the few places that does fried okra that's fresh out of the fryer and not chewy or rubbery. I usually get the veggie plate because I love all the sides. The mac and cheese is one of my favorites. It's worth a try. It's a busy place, but I think it's worth the wait. They have an app called nowait that you can get on the list before you get there."}
{"text":"I really do love the mac and cheese here.  It is also the only place that I know I can get very tasty fried okra.  The okra is always fresh and hot.  I get the veggie plate and add whatever piece of fried chicken I am in the mood for.  Great fried chicken.  This was our first visit to this location. It has a little bigger waiting area than the one on Central.  Their outside patio is much bigger and better accommodating to those of us that may bring along our dogs.  They even brought out a treat (bacon strip) for the dog!  Great service."}
{"text":"So I was totally worried that Lolo's wouldn't live up to the hype. Everyone has been talking about it and it's pretty trendy to go eat there, so my husband and I were excited but reserved about finally trying it. I have to say though, Lolo's totally came through. Seriously the BEST fried chicken I've ever had. I don't normally like fried chicken, but now I realize that's because I haven't had really good fried chicken before!

The only bad thing about the experience was the wait to be seated (especially with a hungry 3-year old) but that's only because of the popularity. They made up for the fast service. Literally minutes after we ordered, we had piping hot food in front of us. 

Hubby and I both stuck to the theme of the restaurant and ordered the Lil' Amadi (chicken thigh & leg and 1 waffle). The chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. As you bit in you got the crunch and then the steam came out...it was amazing. The waffle was cooked to perfection. Slight crispy and golden brown. The batter they used was delicious. I loved the cinnamon or nutmeg or whatever it was in it. We ordered my daughter mac & cheese and i had to steal a bite. So very cheesy and creamy. Some of the best mac & cheese I've had in a long time. And then we also ordered two corn muffins because I saw them go by and I had to try one. They were heaven. So moist and a great flavor. I will never make my own corn bread again because I just can't make it that good, lol.

And finally I was happy because they had Pepsi products (very few restaurants do) and my daughter and husband were ecstatic to have Red Kool-aid in a jar.

The staff was friendly and very prompt. Our jars were never more than half empty and they kept us stocked in napkins :)

All in all, an excellent experieince and if you haven't gone yet, you should."}
{"text":"Parking was plentiful!  Prices seem about the same when it comes eating a southern type places.  Waiter was awesome very helpful with any questions about the menu.  Mimosa was off the hook.  Food was very good!"}
{"text":"Waffles are yummy, chicken is juicy, service is on point. It was loud, but I liked it. I'm a loud person, the atmosphere made it easy to be myself. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We arrived at 10 30 and still sitting here 2 hours later waiting to be served. No matter how good the food is, I will NEVER return here again. The management team was made aware of the situation and not only did they not apologize, they acted as if they didn't care. Horrible."}
{"text":"Really good! I went there at an off time: 3pm on a Friday and it wasn't that busy. There was a small wait but after reading the comments on the lines I'm happy I went when I did. 
We ordered the fried okra, and two plates of chicken and waffles. I really liked their hot sauce, it was nice and tangy. Their waffles were also really great! They had a good amount of spice and were thinner than typical Belgium waffles that most people are used too. Chicken was very good, I prefer mine to have a little less breading but it was very fresh and hot. Their hot chocolate was awesome and the kool aid is a cute touch.
Overall this was a great stop and I am looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Brand new restaurant in Scottsdale. New address from above, about six blocks north. Food and atmosphere is great. They have a nice bar, an outside patio and a disc jockey. All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"The best thing about Lo-Lo's is the staff.  I think during our visit we managed to request the assistance from each staff member, lol.  I have to say although it was abusive on our part, I loved that accessibility.  It gave the place a down-home family feel! I also loved the mason jar motif, especially for the kool-aid (haven't had that since I was a child)!

I didn't eat much because I wasn't that hungry, but I did get a waffle that was delish! Since I'm a veggie, the menu was kinda limited for me, so I kept asking \"can you add something to the waffle?\"  The waiter suggested pecans.  OMG! it was SO good.  My friends enjoyed their chicken and waffles.  My friend's mom didn't care for the grits, but we all loved her banana pudding.  It was the standout dish - well done."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is usually great and the food is delicious.  The last time we went ended awful and we will definitely not be back. The owners wife who was apparently playing manager that night was extremely rude. Zero customer service skills. I guess when your husband owns the place you know you won't be fired so you can just be a complete bitch to paying customers. FOR NO REASON.  Insane. It's too bad because this place  is in walking distance of our house and we liked going there, eating good food, having some koolaid cocktails.  If it had just been a normal manager or server that treated us that way, I would have returned. But because it was the owner, it shows the kind of place it really is."}
{"text":"Being a fan of the infamous Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in Long Beach, I was totally down for some chicken and waffles this morning. The bestie found this place because it was close to my new home in Arizona and was sure to be a hearty brekky after all the physical exertion of packing, moving and loading/unloading a Uhaul. So off we went...

The place is easy to find and pleasant to walk into. The staff was friendly immediately upon arrival. Service was quick and attentive. The menu is simple but appealing...so are the prices. We decided to go with the traditional chicken and waffle plates to satisfy the savory and sweet tooth. Waffles are big, maple syrup is warm and the chicken is perfectly southern fried. 

I'm afraid I have to admit that I may now be thinking of LoLo's first whenever I hear chicken and waffles. MmmMmm!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late lunch on a work trip.

Overall: would eat here again in a heart beat, food was flavorful, well seasoned, and the drinks were perfect! 

The pros: Several of us ordered the tenders and waffles basket and everyone was pleased. Chicken was expertly cooked, breading was crispy, seasoning was excellent, and meat was moist and juicy. The waffle was hands down one of the best I've eaten, spiced with cinnamon I'm guessing, it was fluffy and sweet and perfect. Paired together with syrup, I could eat it all day everyday. Lastly, they have Kool-Aid (which, you should order just on the basis of when can you order Kool-Aid at a restaurant) and it was the best I've ever tasted. The iced tea was also good. 

The cons: the service was a bit slow and our waiter a bit short but nothing that would stop me from coming back. The ranch dressing was also average."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, the blue ivy drink with blue Kool aid was awesome but one less star bc an employee recommended I go to the lolos at the other location? Why lmao"}
{"text":"Took my mom out to Lo-Lo's for dinner on the 29th.  This was my 3rd time at Lo-Lo's and the 1st since the expansion.  The place looks great!  It was a busy Saturday night and the restaurant was packed, but they still found us a table very quickly.  I ordered the Famous Soul Food Platter w/ 3 pieces of chicken, a cornbread muffin, mac & cheese, a waffle and some of that good ol' lemonade.  My mom got the Toy-Toy (I think that's 2 wings and a waffle) and some grape Kool-Aid.

We expected to wait a while for our food, but it was on the table in no time.  Our chicken was hot, crispy and juicy, even better w/ that hot sauce.  The mac was good, cheesy and not cooked to death (which I really appreciated).  That corn muffin was tasty and the waffles... they were just BOMB.  I rolled up a piece of chicken in it and that really set it off.

Even with all those people in there, the staff didn't even seem stressed.  They checked on us and made sure we were taken care of.  Everybody was all smiles the whole time and our server gave us a \"God bless\" on the receipt.  Nice touch!

I'll be back.  You better believe I WILL be back."}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles FIVE STARS *****

I Love this place! I'm a Regular at Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in Los Angeles, Cali. But Lo-Lo's in my opinion Beats Roscoe's.
A party of 6 on a Sunday Morning, we were immediately seated in this nice, clean and new looking spacious restaurant. We were all given our menus and the waiter took our drink orders a few moments later. OMG They have a variety of KOOL AID on Tap! I'm posting the photos, but the idea Genius!

We ordered a combination of Chicken, Waffles, Pancake, Biscuits and Gravy, Mac and Cheese, Fried Eggs, Rice and Dessert. Our order arrived shortly after and let me tell you..
*Portions are Huge! My First thought are these Chickens on Steroids =]
*Fresh, Crispy, Tasty and Piping Hot just out of the Fryer
*Waffles were perfect!
*Mac & Cheese was amazing and so cheesy
*Biscuits and Gravy were Delicious. I normally don't like Biscuits with gravy but this is my exception.

I Love Love Love this place. The prices are great! Service was Fab. I thought it was cute too to see twin brothers working there. Both really friendly. Next time I come to Arizona this will be my first stop. Definitely try thus place. You will not be disappointed =]"}
{"text":"I always get the tre tres it's enough to fill me up with out having to bring out the strchy pants."}
{"text":"The experience was so horrible I don't really know where to begin. 

1st we went here this past weekend during bike week. My group was ready to go and check it out based on all the \"hype\" around this place. I don't hold the wait time to be seated against them. It was actually good based on how crowded they were with visitors. It only took them about 30 min to seat us. One good thing they do is text your phone when your table is ready. I thought that was a good idea. 

The overall atmosphere is good. Nice music playing, lighting etc. A really good atmosphere. I think this place might be great if you were going for drinks only. Good menu selection, good prices etc. So now I got you wondering why the one star review. 

It only took about 30 min to seat us but it took over 1 1/2 hour to get our food from the time we ordered. The server only checked on us once for refills during that entire wait. He comes out and said sorry for the wait but we are busier than usual and I guess it has to do with \"bike week\", then he says your order is up next there is only two orders ahead of you now. Let me think about the definition of the term \"next\"...hmmm \"your order is up next, there are only two orders ahead of you\" well.....let's continue. A while later our food comes out and it was horrible. Let me repeat that horrible. I ordered the biscuits and gravy which is supposed to come with biscuits and gravy, eggs and potatoes. I ordered a side of bacon. What I got was biscuits and gravy, potatoes and my bacon. No eggs which I ordered over medium. The gravy was like paste and all of my food was cold. Not luke warm but cold. I told the server my eggs are not with my meal and he said they would be right out. This was no kidding 15 min later and they he brings them to me and says sorry but do you still want them. Are you kidding me? What type of service is this? The manager/owner whatever is not doing his/her job. This is not good ole southern food. I am from TX and you must be saying it is good ole Southern part of AZ food or something. 

I will not go to this place ever again. I visit AZ for business often and I am a creature of habit. They could have made a fan of me but blew it. I normally will give a place at least two visits before I give a review but the service is awful, the food was awful and the management was not prepared for a big crowd. The feedback I got from my friends is there food was cold, grits were watery, chicken was decent, atmosphere was great and service was horrible. 

Maybe this place is better when they are not busy with all the bikers but I will not go back for several reasons and will not recommend them to a homeless hungry person."}
{"text":"I would give this one 5 stars if it weren't for the terrible hostess that made us feel so incredibly uncomfortable!!!  We had friends in town and they were dying to try it out.  Love the restaurant concept and the food.  I wish I could eat it every day!! 

Pros: 
chicken - crispy, incredibly seasoned
waffles - thin and the perfect crunch!
red kool aid 'drank' - just like it was when you were a kid!
mac 'n cheese - creamy and delish!
the price!!

Cons: 
hostess was rude
bathroom was a lil stinky/dirty... sadface

Can't wait to take more out of towners to this place!"}
{"text":"Now th his is a place that you can go if u want a southern homestyle meal...you wont want to eat for the redt of the day but its worth it...their waffles r to die for I dont know wut they put in the batter but its like no other waffle besides roscoes In la...then you have to have chicken...either the chicken smothered in gravy and onions or the honey hot wings with their fresh fries...dont forget the red koolaid...then you have to have big slice of red velvet cake or if they have lemon thats delicious too...this place is not a place to go if ur watching ur weight but its delicious and very much comfort food I only go to places I love or that have been recommended to me I dont play around"}
{"text":"Very Delicious & plates are very hefty. Sweet tea needs alittle sweeter. Kevin the employee was very helpful and friendlyw"}
{"text":"The quality and taste is amazing however a plate for one waffle was 11 dollars I sure will go again if the add more food to there plates"}
{"text":"I've been to Roscoes' and now I've been to Lo-Lo's. Let's compare.

Location::::::
Roscoes' are typically found downtown LA or in a ghetto. This Lo-Lo's is found in a Phoenix Suburb. Edge: Lo-Lo's.

Parking::::::
I've been to three Roscoes' and the parking situation is always a dinky little parking lot and/or metered parking. This Lo-Lo's is found in plaza with an Albertsons'. Edge: Lo-Lo's. 

Wait time::::::: 
The only time I have ever waited at a Roscoes' is when I had a party of 12. The wait at Lo-Lo's had a wait time of over 40 minutes at 10 AM. After waiting more than 40 minutes, we were finally seated. Edge; Roscoes'

Service::::::
Roscoes' servers take your order quickly and you get your food extremely quickly as well. Our server at Lo-Lo's seemed nice at first and took our order quickly. But that is when things went south. I order a \"KK's\" and a Sweet Iced tea. It took 20 minutes to get my sweet tea and 30 minutes to get our food. In the mean time, I watched an empty table get occupied by two people, their orders taken and food served within a span of 10 minutes.  All before I got my tea. WTF!? Edge: Roscoes'

Waffle:::::
Have you ever had Eggos? If you have, you know no amount of butter and/or syrup will make it special. Enter Lolo's waffles which were essentially plate sized Eggos with no flavor. I only ate one out of two of my waffles... and I LOVE waffles. Roscoes' waffles are just better. I don't know how they make it and what they put in it... but Roscoes' famous waffles just melt in your mouth. Edge: Roscoes'

Chicken:::::::::
The chicken at Roscoes' is terribly dry EVERY time I get it, no matter white or dark meat. This was the best part of Lo-Lo's. The chicken was juicy and the breading was seasoned well. Next time I go I would probably just order the chicken. Edge: Lo-Lo's

Sides: ::::::
I had the grits and eggs with my \"KK's\" platter. They were definitely \"authentic\" because I felt awful after I ate them. Grits drowning in butter and eggs drowning in cheese? Edge: Even

Menu/Prices:::::::
Expect roughly the same price and menu under different names. You're going to have the same plates: the one wing and one waffle, two wings and two waffles with a side, etc. etc. I would say the prices are within a dollar of each other. But they have Kool-aid at Lo-Lo's. I haven't have Kool-aid since I was a kid and I don't plan on every having any in my life again. But they're pretty pound of the fact that they have it on tap. Edge: Even

Portion size:::::::::
I typically finish my food at Roscoes' and I'm completely suffered. I ate half of my \"KK's\" and I was dying. Heart-wise AND stomach-wise.  I literally couldn't eat any more. The portion size at Lo-Lo's is so ridiculous you could literally split any of the major combos with another person and still be full. My \"KK's\" lasted me from about 11 AM all the way until 9 PM at night. Edge: Lo-Lo's

Conclusion:::::::::

1) Why did I bring another establishment into my review of Lo-Lo's? Because you cannot possibly deem something the best ever if it's all you've ever had. 

2) Some places are worth the ridiculous waits and hype. I don't believe this place is. 

3) As far as chicken and waffles are concerned, this place is your average joint at best. 

4) At first I thought this place was favoring Giants' fans over Dodgers' fans but then I realized the staff was making both groups wait equally long. Which either means, their service is just bad overall or they would rather tend to locals than the tourists who will flood the town every March. Not a good way to do business.

5) If you insist on eating here, go as a group of two. You get seated WAY faster and served WAY faster."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst soul food restaurant experience ever. Initially me and my companion were told the wait would  be 20 mins which was expected, but we were seated after 10min. I though, we were off to a good start but I was dead wrong. After being seated it took 15 min for our waitress to even address us. The food didn't not take long to arrive but my food was terrible. I ordered catfish, mac n cheese and collard greens. None of the items I ordered had any flavor, my catfish was slimy and fatty under all of the breading and the mac n cheese was the equivalent of a box of kraft mac n cheese and don't get me started on the collard greens. I have absolutely no idea how this place got 4 or 5 stars but I've been to plenty of souls food restaurants and this place was definitely at the bottom of the barrel on my list of soul food restaurants. I didn't come expecting perfection but I didn't even have a sub par experience."}
{"text":"Well after over an hour and then getting our food it was cold and disgusting.   This place is an embarrassment.  When the food finally arrived it was cold and tasted horrible. The chicken was bland and the waffles might has well been Eggo waffles.   Truly a pathetic and embarrassing experience.  To top it off the manager says I'm terribly sorry I'll give you 15%  off.  Seriously another pathetic joke.  Most reputable Places would have comped the entire meal.   I am seriously considering writing their ownership."}
{"text":"Lolo's is pretty awesome. I'm a big fan of mixing sweet and savory foods and they definitely did a good job of that here. 

The service was great and the food was excellent. The only reason it doesn't get 5 starts is because I didn't like the ambiance. It seems like it is very hard to find a nice, quiet, dark and intimate restaurant in AZ. Everything is brightly lit and resembles a fast food restaurant. I know I shouldn't expect a candlelit dinner environment from a place that sells chicken and waffles, but I like candlelit dinners! Anyways, Lolo's is great and I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffle sounds a bit weird but the combination is the next best thing to peanut butter and jelly. They have some great tasting drinks like the green apple kool-aid and the mac and cheese is top notch. You definitely have to try this place cause you're stomach will appreciate it. FYI don't go on a Sunday cause you most likely have like a 2 hour wait. Enjoy"}
{"text":"WOW! That is the one word that describes this place. Our last day in Scottsdale and we wanted to venture over to Phoenix for some soul food. I am so happy we found this place. Let's just say I have to unbutton my pants because my belly is full! Everything was great!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Soul food right in Scottsdale!  Love it!"}
{"text":"After reading all the negative reviews I was a little hesitant to try it,but have heard great things so took the plunge. Glad I did!  The chicken breast was crispy and delicious, the waffle a little soggy but I still managed to eat it!   The food wasn't ready immediately but this isn't McDonalds, and it was well worth the brief wait. Service didn't blow me away but nothing bad either. Next time I've got time to kill in the airport I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Hands-down the best meal I've had in Phoenix. The menu selection is so large and everything looked so amazing. I cannot wait to go back to try more things.

I got the Lolo's Chicken and Waffles, which came with a fried wing, a thigh, and a drumstick alongside two of the best waffles I have ever consumed. I had a sweet tea (served in a mason jar!) and it was also incredible.

Staff is unbelievably friendly and service is super quick. The ambiance and atmosphere of the restaurant makes you feel like you're a regular even if it's your first time dining. This will definitely be somewhere I eat all the time!"}
{"text":"Find mild sauce that I LOVED! The chicken was moist and juicy. Kids loved the waffles as well. Will definitely make it back often!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!

That about sums it all up.
AWESOME service from every staff member.  Authentic sweet tea (my sister from tennessee gave the approval!).  Love the mason jars for the drinks. and the food...........wow.  I never knew Fried chicken and waffles could be so amazing.
I'm in love.  : )

This was my second time there and i will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Chicken & Waffles need I say more .. wow !! Great atmosphere, friendly service and great food. Allow some time since its busy most of the time. Try their veggie plate and Lolo's #3 you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing, but the service was m'eh at best for us. It looks like it depends on luck if the draw however, as a table that sat down after us were almost done eating by the time we got our food. The only difference was that we got an appetizer and had a different server. If you don't mind a potentially long wait, more than 45 minutes after we ordered, we finally had to talk to a manager to get our food. The food is great but with kids it was hard."}
{"text":"This restaurant itself truly is a one of a kind experience with fantastic food. The reason why I rated it so low is because it consistently has slow service and forgetful servers. 

We will put up with the bad service and keep going back because the food is so dang good.

Make sure to get at least one plate of chicken and waffles to share and you must get the cup of drank! (koolaid) sounds like a weird combination but trust me, it's worth it and part of the experience."}
{"text":"For ALL The great reviews,got my hopes up. The food is average. Best Kool aid. Personally I can make a better waffle at home. Wasn't all that impressed with the chicken either. I have only had take out so maybe someday I'll venture into the establishment - maybe better fresh?"}
{"text":"Sunday wasn't seeming like much of a funday, so we decided to try a new restaurant. Looking for something a little different, we landed on Lo Lo's. Sunday seems to be their busy day because we had to wait about 20 minutes, but the hostess was awesome!! Sat down, and the waiters where joking around with each other, very funny.  The waffles were very good, the chicken wing was moist and delicious, but the breast was dry. The overall experience was great!! The best part? They had Kool Aid!!!"}
{"text":"Never been to the south! But from people I've talked to who have, they say this restaurant comes close to authentic southern cooking! Look, like with any cuisine, nothing's going to compare to your grandmas dishes--but they can come close! The chicken and waffles are undoubtably good! But I might actually prefer the sides: Mac n cheese, collard greens, the list goes on!"}
{"text":"This is the best chicken and waffles i have ever been to. When Mari \"squeaky voice\" let us know that there was kool-aid, i knew it would be good. 

The chicken was flavored perfectly like back home and cooked on point. That Kool-aid was SWEET as all get out, but took me back to the good ol days until i saw it was $3.50 lol. No worries though.

The waffles with that cinnamon was lovely and the music was top notch. Im going back before i leave this dope place to get more lo lo's #3 and a fonky fresh shirt."}
{"text":"How can you say anything bad about Lolo's?  This place has it all figured out.  Decor, service, food & atmosphere are all part of the experience. 

I think certain restaurants really get you into the mood to eat there, and Lolo's is one of them.  The location in Scottsdale is bright, cheery and has great music (jazz & hip hop when I was there) playing from the counter in front of the kitchen.  Plus, we have great service every time we go.

The food here is king.  I've had the chicken & waffles and the fried catfish platter.  I will admit I am not a fried chicken connoisseur, but this was the best I've ever had, and I've eaten at some great places in Georgia and South Carolina.  The waffle is actually thinner than you might expect, but it's darn tasty.

My favorite is definitely the Catfish.  Their seasoning in the batter and the quality of fish made for a killer meal.  AND, if you love cheese, get the mac & cheese.  There is no fake cheese sauce in there.  It was real cheese, and it was thick!  The fried Okra was the perfect finishing touch.

Please keep in mind both times I ate here, I was with petite ladies that ordered on the lite side (who watched me devour the greatness & have been back since to eat what I had), and I wish I wore stretchy pants.

One more thing... They serve real Kool-Aid (OH YEAH!)..."}
{"text":"Hi, this was my second time to this place with my husband on a Friday evening/night. Our server Alexis was horrible. She was short, no smile and looked like she was done for the day and we were inconveniencing her. She only came 3 times to our table, first to bring drinks, then food and then check. Another server who was tending to the table in front of us came over to ask if we have been helped.. I ordered iced tea with some ice water same thing my husband ordered. She brought the iced teas and forgot our waters. After asking for it again, she forgot to bring and then we did not bother. After waiting for 10-15 minutes, We ordered our food on her second visit to our table. Food arrived in other 15-20 minutes later but it was what my husband had ordered. I had to wait another 10 minutes before my food came, while  my husband waited for my to get my food. Food arrived hot, brought by another staff member. Mine was very greasy, there was so much oil around my eggs but grits and waffle were good. My husband's food was great- no complaints whatsoever. While we ate and finished, she did not come to check if food was okay and that is when the other server tending to next table, stopped by to ask if we were okay. My husband mentioned to the server about our server Alexis and that she has no time for the guest. He apologized on her behalf. And we asked for our check. This was a hopeless visit, we had better experience at the Scottsdale location. I am sure we would had a better experience if we had another server, as there were others that we found were smiling and chatting and looked happy to be there. We would rather go to Scottsdale building than this one!"}
{"text":"You really do \"gotta go go to Lo Lo's!\" Just follow the dancing chicken leg you won't be disappointed. Seriously though, some of the best Southern food I have ever eaten, you know, aside from my grandmother's who was born and raised in North Carolina and wasn't stingy with the bacon grease when cooking. They clearly use quality ingredients and make everything from scratch, you can taste it! I highly recommend the collard greens, fried okra, and especially the banana pudding! The fries were good too but you have so many other choices for sides that you just can't get  anywhere else so go with one of those options. The service was also fabulous! Our server was very polite and his face must hurt so bad by the end of the shift because he never stopped smiling. You should go just for the novelty of asking \"What types of Kool Aid are you serving today?\""}
{"text":"Just moved to Tempe from LA and Lo-Lo's is a weak substitute for Roscoe's.

The waffles are actually pretty good. Tasty batter, standard baseball-sized ball of butter on top, and warm maple syrup to fill up every little square with. 4/5.

The batter on the chicken is just meh... It's juicy but lacking in flavor. Bummer. 2/5.

If getting adult-onset diabetes is a personal goal of yours, get the banana pudding'. I couldn't get past the first bite. 2/5.

And so my chicken and waffles hunt in AZ continues..."}
{"text":"Great service - thanks Jamal & AJ! Great atmosphere and love the 90s & 2000s hip hop music!!! Waffle was good, fried chic was very good, corn bread muffin was huge but could be a touch sweeter and it was a little dry, and the sweet tea is definitely southern sweet! The greens were spicy!! Overall enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"The hype was unmet, along with the expectations of juicy and flavorful fried chicken.  For the price I paid I was looking forward to at least better-than-average waffles and chicken, but neither hit the spot.  The chicken was dry, had a little too much breading, and needed more seasoning/spices.  The waffles were also dry, and no amount of syrup or butter helped.  I love fried chicken, skin and all, and to quote David Chang, \"I could eat the worst fried chicken and love it,\" but I just wasn't impressed here.

(1) The space itself was clean, spacious, and bright, (2) our server was friendly, (3) the Kool-Aid was refreshing, and (4) the mason jars in which the drinks are served were cool, but (5) as for the food itself - not worth it."}
{"text":"I arrived with a party of eight to Lo-Lo's on Saturday at noon.  Another member of our party had put us on the list around 11:50am. It was close to 12:45pm before we were seated, but we anticipated a wait and were prepared.

We weren't prepared for the terrible experience inside the door.

It was at least fifteen minutes before our order was taken. We lost the first members of our party who couldn't wait for their food forty minutes later. Another member dropped out at the one-hour mark and one more at the hour and fifteen-minute mark. In all honesty, they never ate at Lo-Lo's before and didn't know what they were missing. 

During this time, we watched as every table around us was served, so I asked to speak to a manager and found the root of the problem.

When I asked if he was the manager he didn't say hi, he didn't offer his name, he just shrugged his shoulders.  Finally, he graced me with his presence before heading into the kitchen to investigate.  He returned with the following line \"according to your ticket time, sir, you have only been waiting for thirty one minutes.\"  When we questioned if it was possible the waitress forgot to enter the order in right away he repeated the line like a robot and closed with \"that's what I have to go on.\" I was ready to leave when another member of my party took over the conversation and was invited by the manager to go look at the ticket time in the kitchen.    

I estimate he wasted about ten to fifteen minutes trying to justify their poor service than actually tackling the problem.  

Suddenly, like magic, our food started to arrive. Our waitress removed the charges for the orders of our party members who had to leave, which I applaud her for. The manager, we never saw him again. Not to touch base, not to say sorry, not even to invite us back.

I don't think we will be back...but the food is SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing brunch this morning! The chicken was perfect (especially dipped in hot sauce and honey!), the home style potatos were great, and the cheesy grits would have made my grandmama smile! I highly recommend LoLo's, the staff was great & fun to be around, but be prepared for the carb coma that will soon follow after your last bite!"}
{"text":"I was scared.  I wanted to go here, but I was scared.  I was scared of the location, I was scared of the menu, I was just... scared.

Last night changed though.  Something inside me gave me the courage to step into this establishment.  I don't know what I was expecting, but I was definitely surprised.  I was greeted with a big smile, instructions to sit wherever I wanted and my drink order taken right away.  

I went with the chicken breast, waffle, scrambled eggs, and fried okra.  Needless to say, it was delicious.  I really can't say anything negative about this place.  I came, I ate, and I will be back."}
{"text":"Traveling with a senior to & fro at times is challenging & this trip out was no exception. My senior Mom misheard & headed straight out to the patio & she seated herself on the patio on a BUSY Saturday at prime time lunch time. This seating is not a seat yourself it's seated by the host staff. However the sweet young man that was the server in the area saw what happened was an innocent mistake on my Mom's part & spoke with the host & they allowed us not only to be seated ahead of another group waiting but let us stay on the patio. What a joy to see someone in their 20's having compassion for someone 60+ years their senior made my day. I was so moved that we didn't have to embarrass & move her I tipped an additional 20% on top of the usual 20% I usually tip. I will never foregut that trip or that young mans kindness. 
The food oh yeah that's what we're here for right? RIGHT! I have been frequenting Lo-Lo's for years & visited them when they had one location downtown. I'm happy this local fam has made the transition to multiple locations because the fried chicken is beyond perf with crisp moist chickeny goodness & perfectly chewy fluffy waffles. I am a super fan of the sweet & salty combo probably because I am that as well. So I can't vouch any other thing on the menu as I have never left what they're known for. I know shame on me but why mess with the best? Just sayin'. 
The new Scottsdale location is head & shoulders about the previous in what was a Kyoto Bowl once upon a time & they have a bar & a DJ all day on the weekends. Gotta love that. Well I do so there. Keep it up Lo-Lo's & cheers to many more years of success."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite restaurant in Phoenix best waffles ever!!!! Service was fantastic.  Cool aid was cold and yummy. Large portions, great prices and awesome food."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken strips and fries and it's been over 40 minutes since I've ordered. Such a long wait for a simple dish. Also it's not even busy, there're over 7 empty tables. Not an experience I thought I was gonna get for being a first timer."}
{"text":"Amazing and home cooked food! Everything is fresh and just simply perfect!!! If you haven't been here then you are missing out!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but enjoy the cooking at the original spot better."}
{"text":"My husband experienced soulfood at Lo Lo's for the first time a few months ago and we brought some of our family and one of his cousins who was visiting us from out of state. The restaurant itself is small and seating is tight and compact, so large groups don't feel so welcome. The host initially took awhile to seat us but other than that the service was great. 

The food was good but not as wonderful as I expected, so claims of the fried chicken here being the best are exaggerated and the food was overpriced considering our surroundings (come-on the spot needs to be renovated and its located in a beat down area of Central Phoenix). 

Overall the service and food were what you'd expect from any regular ordinary spot, there was nothing overly great about either the food or the service."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour to be seated for a party of 8 and as I'm sitting they told us we have to wait another hour before the foods ready which made no sense. After the food took over a hour and came separately we asked for the manager because we were aggravated. I couldn't believe the lady they brought over was a manager. I thought they were playing a joke on us. This place is pathetic and needs new management. Never again will i step in this restaurant which has valet for no reason and horrible management and staff. A sorry after waiting for 3 hours to eat just come waffles wouldn't have hurt. So I hope the owner sees his and is happy."}
{"text":"I love chicken and waffles. That is the best idea anybody ever had. I think Lo-Lo's is the best. Even better than that famous place in California. This was my first time at the Phoenix location. I have been to the Scottsdale location a few time. I don't know which one I like better. They are both great. The Phoenix one does have a very nice outdoor seating are. They have a big green outdoor couch that is very comfy. Great to hang out on while you wait for your table.
I was there for the 4th meeting of the UYE Breakfast Club. Always a good time with great people. I know they have other things on the menu but how do you get by the chicken and waffles. One day I might have to go twice in one day so I can try something else. I ordered the 2 drumsticks and a waffle. #10. It was awesome of course. Don't forget the jar of Kool Aid. Yum. So good. Great service too. Everyone is always really nice. This is the place where I first tried grits. I have heard people complain about grits in general but these were great. Add a little honey and they are almost perfect. Maybe some cinnamon would put them over the top. This one of those places where the food is so good you can't stop eating even though you are full.
The place was very clean and the pictures on the wall are great. This is one of my favorite places and I will be back to this location or the Scottsdale one over and over again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The staff is incredible, and the food is amazing. You MUST order the chicken and waffles. Oh, and order a jar of drank. Come hungry. Leave happy."}
{"text":"Went with a large group.  We were promptly seated and offered drinks.  I tried a blue drink (can't remember name) recommended by the waiter. Wow, it was tasty but very strong. We ordered a variety of items for dinner and every thing was awesome!  The portions were enough and then some! Good comfort food an good customer service.   Looking forward to taking my family on my next visit to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Two of my favorite foods put together seamlessly with some of the best hot sauce you could ask for. They even have us some free cool-aid!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the \"Betty Boob\" platter. It's the signature waffle and chicken and a great serving size!"}
{"text":"Been here several times. Always good food. Every time I've been here it's been a long wait but that's because I usually go on Sundays and its very popular"}
{"text":"The food was ruined by the bad service and horrible attitude of manager, Danny White. I will never spend another dime here again. Never had an experience like this at the old location. Get it together and hire a real restaurant manager and front of house!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place. So excited in fact that I walked out of the terminal knowing that I'd have to go back through security again to get back on my plane. The best thing I can say about this place was that the cashier was upbeat, helpful and friendly. Otherwise this could be the most overpriced chicken and waffles I've ever had in my life. I was pretty disappointed although the sweet tea was way better than anything else I'd expect to find in Phoenix.

When I ordered three boneless chicken tenders with a waffle they told me it was going to take 12 minutes to cook and it did. I was more than happy to wait and had plenty of time. I figured having paid $16 for the meal it was going to be darn good. Unfortunately that wasn't the case period

I I grabbed my meal walked 20 feet and sat down at a table to try it out. The waffle was soaking wet and not even close to being done. This is an epic fail for a place that advertises Chicken and Waffles. If you're going to pride yourself on a meal like this the waffle better be crispy and have flavor period this had neither. The chicken was very average but no better than something offered at chains like Raising Cane's for a quarter of the price. What was most disappointing was there was absolutely no flavor to the chicken tender at all. Sure, it was fairly juicy but if you didn't dip it in the ranch you might as well drink water because it was tasteless. I ate the chicken tenders just because I paid so much for him and left the waffle after trying it. 

Another thing to consider if you are going to charge us as much as you do please take into consideration that everyone has to use a fork and knife to eat the waffle. That means when you place the waffle on foil and you try to cut through it the foil breaks apart and embeds itself in the waffle. Unfortunately foil doesn't taste well.  Even a paper plate would be much better. Again what a disappointment."}
{"text":"Not from the area so I've never heard of this place. I've also never had chicken and waffles but I've always wanted to try it, so me and my friend picked this spot for our dinner stop. 

This place is hilarious! The decorations, the shirts the servers wear, the menu, it all made me laugh. Like the sign on the wall that says \"Kool Aid always on tap.\"

We ordered the original, KK's and Shrimp and Grits. Our drinks, fruit punch kool aid and water, came quickly but the food took a good 35 minutes later. 

The first piece of chicken, a chicken thigh, was SUPER good. Moist, tender, juicy, everything you would want in a piece of fried chicken. However, the second piece, chicken breast, was rather dry. I guess it makes sense since chicken breast is typically hard to cook juicy. Waffles were good. Didn't really care for the biscuit and plain grits. But the shrimp and grits were really good. Really heavy and packed with flavor.

Pretty good first experience for chicken and waffles. I would definitely recommend the place for their food and experience but the wait for our order was what brought it down to 4 stars."}
{"text":"When we arrived there was a wait, but it was well worth it. The portions were huge and the flavors delicious. The waffles were my favorite part... I would definitely return next time I am in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Wow what a waste of my time! I can't believe we waited over 45 minutes for just OVER cooked fried chicken and waffles. After waiting for that amount of time I thought we were for sure getting chicken straight from the deep fryer but when it came out it looks like its been waiting under the heat light for 3 hours or so. The wait staff is horrible, they don't know time management everyone is slow. 

My boyfriend and I will Never go here again and we recommend you don't as well!"}
{"text":"It was okay. It wasn't the best waffle or fried chicken. The waffle was much better than the chicken, but it wasn't that amazing. Maybe it was just over hyped for us!"}
{"text":"love the new location...as always staff and management is awesome...and the food is OFF THE CHAIN!!! thanks also to contributing to help the needy."}
{"text":"Not worth it at all! The greens are mediocre and the Mac and cheese is just sad!  I can do better at home!  I will say that the catfish was delicious but the fried chicken was just okay.  The service was SLOW!  I went on a weeknight and the restaurant wasn't that crowded so I don't know why it took so long for mediocre food."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place at all. The chicken I found to be very greasy and was overcooked. The waffles lacked luster in taste....they were straight bland. The place was packed when I went on a Saturday morning and there was no order anywhere in the restaurant. It took over 30 minutes to get the check after we had finished eating. Then to pay there was a line a mile long at the register and one register was not working properly. Was a late morning mistake to come and try this place out. I would avoid eating here the chicken lacks flavor."}
{"text":"My first review on yelp is Lola's in Phoenix (another favorite) and it is certainly not to be mistaken for Lo-lo's. This soul food joint is one of the best in the country - it has a proper back-kitchen, cafeteria feel to it, friendly service and hands down the best waffles and chicken anywhere. There is something uniquely cinnamonny in the syrup that makes the perfect topper to their waffle; the chicken is deep fried, the grits waiting to swim in butter, the lemonade cool and sweet on a hot Phoenix day. Your doctor may not like you going here, but your stomach certainly will.

Find an odd hour to go; Sunday mornings are always particularly packed with the post-church crowd and it's harder than usual to find a seat. Chicken and waffles are good any time of the day.

And a last note - get a t-shirt, wear it around and see just how unusual the idea of chicken and waffles is to the non soul food loving masses."}
{"text":"Been frequenting Lolo's ever since their only location was the house on Central.  With upgrades, renovations and now this new location in Scottsdale, Lolo's has become my go-to for out-of-town guests who come to visit Phoenix!  This Scottsdale location is definitely bigger and much more accommodating - all while extending their menu but still managing to keep the original items that never disappoint!  I always get the Tre Tre (2 drumsticks and a waffle) and a Red Kool-Aid.  Their drinks are served in huge Mason jars and Kool-Aid is ordered by color (Red, Blue, etc.).  One must try the Fried Gizzards!  

Anyway, this location also offers a nice patio but the only downfall for myself would be the parking.  It is valet only and there are signs from the hotel (they share the parking lot) everywhere that say that parking is for hotel guests only.  So, just abide by those rules or park across the street near the BoA (who wants to do that when it's 110 outside?!)... just valet it!"}
{"text":"If they had 10 stars i would give them 10 stars!! First and foremost the young lady who answered the phone was so nice a pleasant, i couldn't wait to meet her in person when i picked up my food, she was great! My sister was craving some stick to ribs type of food and mentioned fried chicken and i was all over it!! I was a little on the fence about how good this soul food was going to be in AZ (sorry not judging the area but Im from the east coast) So we ordered the Lo-Lo special, corn bread, collard greens, mac and cheese and lemonade!!! The chicken was perfectly cooked and seasoned and nice crispy skin, corn bread muffins were so delicious collard greens they got just right, holy mac and cheeesssee. Reasonable prices and clean!"}
{"text":"An obligated stop everytime I'm in Phoenix. Since the first time.i went 2 years ago they're pimping the place which is nice but hope they don't over do the place. Great food and music the best blue kool-aid"}
{"text":"Visited on 8/20/2016 at 11:15am.  The place was packed.  We waited 13 minutes in the tiny waiting area in front to be seated by the children running the host stand.  It's an interesting place.  Both of us had different versions of their chicken & waffles.  It was very loud in the restaurant, and we had trouble understanding our waitress who took our drink and food order.  Waited through two cups of coffee for our food.  The food was OK. Just OK.  Nothing really special in my opinion.  I was expecting something better.  Trying to have a conversation with my date was very difficult because it was so loud in the place.  Glad they had flavored creamers for our coffee, though.

I wish I could have had their Banana Pudding. It looked delicious.  If I come back, I'll be sure to bring my earplugs.  Did I mention that it was loud here?"}
{"text":"gooood tasting chicken mac & cheese was soo tasty"}
{"text":"This is my first experience with chicken AND waffles. A bit too weird for me. Even after seperating it... eating the chicken first, then waffles... The chicken was sub-par, and the waffles were... eh...

Seriously, everyone who gave this place 5 stars... have you guys/gals ever eaten at KFC? or IHOP? Now thats some good chicken and waffles.

The sweet tea was good... I also got a stomach ache later on. I'm going to have to try Rosco's Chicken and Waffles... just to compare."}
{"text":"This was my first chicken and waffles place. I was with my family here and loved it. Even though another table that was sat after us and was a much bigger party got their food first which was odd because we were very hungry and already unhappy that day. But when we finally got our food, it was so good and worth every penny. The waiter was great and will definitely go back when I am in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Exceptional service! Let me start with the waffles...they very light & fluffy. Flavorful & melted in my mouth. I paired them with 2 thighs (the #9 on the menu to be exact) & a JAR of grape Kool-aid. I was in heaven. I've been to a number of \"waffle houses\" this by far is THE BEST one yet."}
{"text":"The food is fine, not the best I've ever had, but not bad. The drinks are the same: pretty good. I enjoyed eating here from time to time. For example, the fried chicken and fried fish is good, but their chicken gizzards are trash. 

The service at this location, however, is terrible. I always end up waiting forever to order and receive my food. I called yesterday to place an order to go, which I've done before. This time they claimed that they don't take orders over the phone.

If you're trying to pick a restaurant, go to Miss White's instead. It's a hole in the wall, but the food is much better and the people are nicer."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Best fried chicken and pancakes! I highly recommend this place to my friends and family. And they loved it! Customer service was awesome! And service was fast!"}
{"text":"Very very slow for food. Wonder why couldn't it be a bit faster for fried chicken and pancakes? The complicity of the their food process must be so difficult that it takes more than 30 mins."}
{"text":"Lolo's was a place I had heard lots of good things about so I was eager to give it a try myself. The menu is simple, different combos of breakfast favorites and fried chicken. I opted for the #8 Betty Boop (fried chicken breast and waffle) with a side order of bacon and a cup of coffee. 

The food came out pretty quickly, and was a nice sized portion. I don't have fried chicken often, but Lolo's chicken was cooked well (crispy on the outside) with a lot of flavor. It offset my nice, light waffle perfectly and my bacon was cooked more on the well done side of things (my fav). It filled me up pretty quick, so I took home leftovers. Next time I want to try their grits, but I can't imagine ordering more chicken or waffles then what the #8 offers. I was full all day!

We were there on a Monday morning, and while the restaurant was never packed to capacity it was steady. We received good service and my coffee was always full. We were greeted by a smiling server when we arrived, and wished a good day by a server who was not even on duty yet. I'm a sucker for little things like that, I will definitely be back and recommending Lolo's."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Lo-Lo's. It's been on my AZ bucket list for 2 years. To say I was excited would be an understatement. I was dancing in anticipation. It wasn't very busy which seemed like a plus. We were seated immediately. Seemed like another plus. We waited about 50 minutes for our food- soul crushing. As we watched people who were seated long after us be served my rumbling tummy began to wonder where the F my food was. Our waitress didn't come back that entire time to check on us so I couldn't really update my stomach on the sitch. On a time restraint and irritated my adorable boyfriend (I have one now) flagged down an employee and ask them to check on our order as basically everyone else in the restaurant but us was eating. At this point our waitress finally surfaced for the first time in 45 minutes. We asked her how everyone who was seated after us was already eating and she told us TO ASK THE KITCHEN. Are you kidding me?! Also, they messed up my boyfriend's order and didn't give him all his food but we couldn't tell her because she vanishes like.. I don't know, anything that vanishes quickly and for long periods of time that doesn't want to return. We asked for the manager at this point and told him what the waitress said/ about the wait/ the food and he also blamed the kitchen. I feel really bad for the inanimate kitchen at this point. It gets blamed for everything. I don't think the kitchen is to blame when people who come in well after us get their food before us but I also haven't really worked in the industry so I might be wrong. Strong sense says she simply didn't put our food in and doesn't know how to take responsibility. The manager didn't apologize for the waitress' attitude or take anything off the bill for us waiting nearly an hour and messing up our order or for their service. He did offer a free dessert, however, it was 10 in the morning and we were already over their bologna. My suggestion- Take some ownership! This was our first time in your establishment. You guys messed up. You let us sit there for 50 minutes after we placed our order watching people who sat down after us eating without ever checking in on us. We had to flag you down. Your waitress told us to go in the back AND ASK THE KITCHEN WHAT WAS TAKING SO LONG. Listen, if I knew I could freely go in the kitchen I would have made a snack because I was hungry as all get out. 

The  foodie in me and die hard downtownian is deeply disappointed and will likely never go back or recommend. 

I gave it two stars because the chicken and waffles were alright.. the restaurant was clean. I got a refill on my coffee in my cute ass Lolo's mug from someone who was not my rude waitress.. although since I'm here writing this I might as well say that the mug had a large chip on the rim some could say is a liability. The hot sauce was good. I am a big hot sauce girl. My water came with a lemon which could be construed as classy and didn't taste like gross AZ tap and one waitress had cute hair and smiled at me..so that was nice."}
{"text":"I first had Lo-Lo's about 7-8 years ago when it looked like a house that had been converted into a restaurant.  The fried chicken was amazing and much better than Roscoe's.  I've revisited several times since and usually stops by whenever I am in Phoenix.  This weekend was no different.  I was delighted to see that I could join the waitlist on Yelp to cut down on actual wait time for a table.  That was a nice touch and a practice that I wish more restaurants would do!  We checked in with the host and about 20 minutes later were seated.  Not too shabby.

My bf and I split the shrimp mac and cheese and the 3 piece fried chicken, waffles, grits, and eggs (Scrambled with cheese and onion).  We also got fruit punch and grape Kool-aid because that's what you do when Kool-aid is on tap!

The shrimp mac and cheese came with a biscuit.  There's a decent amount of shrimp and bacon in the dish but it was extremely greasy.  I mean I understand that mac and cheese is not a light dish, however, the amount of bacon grease allowed in the dish was ridiculous.  The fried chicken and waffles were good but nothing memorable like that first visit.  The scrambled eggs were overcooked and became rubbery.  I much prefer the scrambled eggs from Roscoe's.  The grape Koll-aid was better than the fruit punch flavor as all we could taste was sugar.  

As for service, our waitress was sweet but did not remember our request at all.  I asked for a plate and ketchup and she disappeared.  When she did come back, I had to remind her of my request.  She then disappeared again for about 15 minutes before she came back with the plate and ketchup.  I saw her fingers accidentally came into contact with the ketchup but she played it off and gave it to me anyway.  She had to wipe her fingers (directly in front of us) right after.  Hmm, no thanks.

Overall, I no longer feel that Lo-Lo's is shoulders above Roscoe's.  It's serviceable if you're in the mood for fried chicken and Kool-aid whenever you're in the area but definitely not a must-eat destination!"}
{"text":"Have been here before and it was just as good as I remembered. I had the chicken strips with waffles, mac and cheese, and a grape kool aid jug. It was a little too sweet but overall it was an excellent meal. My husband had grits, eggs and waffles and he was happy."}
{"text":"The chicken is delicious but the waffles need serious help. Waffles MUST be crispy and airy. I can make mushy (pancake like) waffles at home. They need to ditch the \"family recipe\" and get a new one. Prices are crazy high for what you get. I like the building and atmosphere. I haven't tried the other menu options but they look tasty."}
{"text":"If soul food is what you want then Lo Lo's is definitely the place to go. The down home food and the urban atmosphere are the main attractions. Although, I recommend the Scottsdale location, don't expect an upscale restaurant. You're going to find great food, very basic tables and chairs, decent service and a very relaxed atmosphere.  

LoLo's takes me back to when I was a kid when I used to drink koolaid out of a mayonnaise jar! Yes, they serve Koolaid & other beverages out of big jars! It's great! ;) I've had The Catfish and The Chicken (both fried and the smothered chicken-shamefully) they were both Amazing! I've also had the collard greens, the macaroni and cheese (OMG! So Good!), green bean & red potatoes, sweet potatoes, rice and gravy. I must say Everything I've tried was Amazing!!!! 

If you've never had it ,you must give it a try! Don't be scuured! Lol the crowd is very diverse!  There has been a wait most times I've gone. However, the food is definitely worth the wait! Don't plan on sticking to your diet! I sure couldn't ....but, they do have salads. But, what's the use in going to a soul food restaurant if you Don't Experience The Soul Food?! When you go let me know how it was!"}
{"text":"Uhm.........yaaaaaas! I don't remember who my server was, but we came in the last bit of the night and she gave us AMAZING service. I'm definitely going to look at my receipts and see if her name was there.

Food was sooooooo good. We came in 3- minutes before closing. We ordered their bottomless mimosas and it was mostly orange juice and cheap champagne. But it did its job.

As for the chicken and waffles, they were super yum. The waffles were on the flatter side and I would have liked them a little more fluffy. But that's okay. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food here is great, and the service was lovely.  My only challenge was the Scottsdale dj booth that played the music so loudly we couldnt talk.  When we first entered I noticed the sound was pretty loud so we asked to be seated in a quieter part of the restaurant.  It didnt help.  
We shared the green bean appetizer to start, and it was quite good.  Crispy, not greasy and the sauce was a great accompaniment.  Have tried their foods a few times and am always impressed with vegetable sides.  Their greens are incredible and I always enjoy the grits.  Ive been told by the servers that the greens are not made with any meat, but the flavor is impressive.
Malazia's Focheezy Juicy Hood Burger was tasty, we also tried the traditional chicken and waffles which are always a good choice.  All the food we tried was well prepared and enjoyable.  Having tried the Banana Puddin in the past, we knew it to be a great end to our meal, but none of us had room to eat it.  
I will go back to the Central Phoenix location again, and may even try Scottsdale during the day to see if the music is turned down at all.  We all enjoyed our meal and look forward to trying it again!"}
{"text":"This place is always busy... And it should be. Food is great, service is good, serving size is good.  Parking is kind of tight and the valet is a bit slow. First time visitors might not be able to find the place that easy."}
{"text":"Who put the gum rapper in the mac n cheese....

Long story short, after eating half of my Mac n cheese. I discovered a long, thick white something at the bottom of my mac n cheese bowl. I immediately gave the entire bowl to a server, who asked me what it was at the bottom of the bowl. I replied I don't know, that's why I'm giving it to you. He took the bowl to the kitchen, when he returned he told me that it was a gum wrapper. I replied how did a gum wrapper get in the mac n cheese, he said that's what my managed wanted me to ask you. I said WOW, I did not/ was not chewing gum. The manager did not even come to the table to see what the issue was, and all they did to correct the situation was offer another mac n cheese or remove it from the bill. NO APOLOGY was given, nothing but oh well.....POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE....LOLOS will not be getting any more of my hard earned money...."}
{"text":"Terrible service
First time I came here I brought my family and it was semi decent. The second time the service was terrible and it only the one time to get on my bad side when it comes to my food.
The server was not comprehending, the manager did not show any concern in regards to the service I receive. An hour later when my food came out I immediately asked for a togo box. I will never eat here again. Usually I tip a $12 minimum and today was the first day I decided not to tip."}
{"text":"We have always gone to the south Phx location. I wanted to try out this location to see if it was any different. The food is the same as usual, large, tasty dishes. Same great service. My kids think the south Phx location has more character to it. It feels the same to me. We had Stupid Fries. Such a large portion. They really need to be shared. The chicken basket with waffle and biscuits and gravy. My all time favorite is their Mac and cheese. I could eat a gallon or more of that golden goodness."}
{"text":"I definitely enjoyed Lo-Lo's, but I don't know if part of it wasn't just because of the novelty, and how much I wanted to like it. We went on a Sunday after church, and it was PACKED. We had a very long wait (which told us it must be pretty good!), but the kind people of Lo-Lo's were kind enough to provide us with a shade structure and mister-fan to combat some of that infamous Phoenix heat. They even had a water cooler with cold water for us to enjoy while we waited, so that we would not swoon from heat exhaustion.

The food was tasty, that's for sure. I ordered one piece of chicken breast and one waffle. Both items were DELICIOUS! Thank goodness Lo-Lo's knows how to make their namesake dishes, and make them well! I felt like my meal cost a little more than I would have hoped, for just a piece of chicken and a waffle. It's worth going there, though, for the experience."}
{"text":"First time here.  I was motivated to try this place because Yelp sent some email about waffles.  On the list was Lo-Lo's.  Well, you know how that goes.  It gets into your head and you gotta try it.  Saturday is my non-cooking day, but it wasn't the smartest thing to show up at Lo Lo's on a Saturday night.  Yikes,  the line was out the door, into their patio, into the parking lot and up the street (just kidding about the street)  Went to check in to give my name and number in the party but had to wait because too many people were fussing about the wait and who got there first, etc.  Luckily the owner (I think; lady with short red hair) was a strong yet polite lady and explained that the 50-60 minute wait was what it was.  If it was shorter, good, but she couldn't guarantee that.  People don't like to hear the truth.  I was prepared to face up to my stupidity of coming on a Saturday night when there is Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Sunday.  So I KNEW I was waiting and I would be waiting until people finished smacking their lips on that delish fried chicken and everything else.  But No.  People gotta fuss.  Speaking of fussing, a woman slid in front of me and when the check-in lady looked at both of us to figure out who was there first, the woman said to me,  \"I was waiting here didn't you see me?\".  My answer was \"No, I didn't.  But you go on ahead because I am not starting a scene here over a table\".  I think the owner overheard me and smiled.  Did I tell you the woman was bigger than I am?  I am no stupid chick from the Bronx.  You don't fight unless you have to and it won't be over a table.  So about 20 minutes later the owner, shall I call her Redhead, for short? motioned us over and led us to a table for four.  Nice table, I thought and not so long a wait.  She picks up the menus from the table and says, come with me, I have a better seat for you--I like you guys.  And then she led me to the almighty BOOTH.  I love Booths. I love Booths, Did I tell you I love booths?  OMG. A booth.  Thank you lord. Thank you Ms. Redhead.  I knew that stepping back and not body slamming that aggressive woman at the beginning would pay off. Did I tell you she was bigger than I am?  Did I tell you we don't fight in the Bronx unless it's for big stakes.  Yes, I believe I did.  
Phase II--SITTING IN THE BOOTH:
So now we order.  We got two waters and one beer.  AND WE WAITED FOREVER FOR THE WATERS.  FOREVER.  How about 20 minutes? We stopped a guy to ask him to get our waitress and then, the waters parted and our waitress was there with our waters, beer and what seemed to be everybody else's waters.  She said, Sorry it took so long, but we had to wait until the glasses were washed.  Wow.  I realize it is a packed house but at moments like these when you run out of glasses what's wrong with serving water out of a red party cup?  I wouldn't have minded especially with the generous slice of lemon they put in it.  Think about it.  I understand beer and cocktails being served in glass (BTW, they are large mason jars I forgot to tell you), but not water.  You can slide on water.
Hubby ordered the chicken salad with a side of french fries.  I went on full mode pig out.  2 fried chicken thighs with a waffle AND a side of mac and cheese.  
Hubby's order came out with the bacon he did NOT want.  Know anybody else who doesn't eat bacon?  I don't. Just him.  When corrected, the salad had mixed greens, half a sliced avocado and nice chunks of fried chicken.  The fries were fresh with a sprinkling of some delicious topping.  He was happy.  My thighs were not greasy (the chicken's, that is). The waffle, while thin, had a lot of flavor (maybe vanilla and cinnamon).  The mac and cheese was tasty and creamy.  What it was lacking was the crunchiness on the top and the corners.  I like the mac n cheese to have crunch on top.  This was smooth like \"Stouffers\".  Not saying it's Stouffers, just texture wise. 

I totally enjoyed my gorge-fest. I finished everything on the plate.  Hubby on the other hand said that while the salad was fresh, varied and plentiful his chicken salad was not worth a repeat visit.  As always, he said he could stay home and get better food.  Yes, ladies.  That is the punishment for learning to cook and cook well.  Men are like breast fed babies when it comes to home cooked meals.  They want breast milk and will reject formulas or substitutes that are just as good.  So let's ignore hubby's assessment and trust me that the food was very good and worth a repeat visit.  Thank you Ms. Redhead for the booth and the great food."}
{"text":"Oh.my.gosh.  I LOVE this place!  We read about Lolo's in a magazine and stopped by on our way out of town.  I'm so glad we did!  Their chicken was some of the best I've had anywhere--way better than Roscoe's!    The waffles have a great flavor and were crisp.  I love the collard greens, too.  It's definitely worth the trip and the wait!  I can't wait for a return trip to Phoenix to try more sides and get more of those chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"Fantastic chicken and waffles! Cornbread was perfect and the koolaid was just like as a kid! Fun atmosphere and good value! Would go back!"}
{"text":"Lo Lo's is pretty much what you'd expect a place focusing on \"Chicken & Waffles\" to be. Small, lively, full of smiling people all eating, well......chicken and waffles. The line out front attests to its popularity. 

After finishing the Phoenix 10K this morning, our group decided that Lo Lo's would be the perfect place to undo all of the health gains we had made. Little did I know that I would be undoing an entire year's worth of morning jogs. It was the sort of experience that makes you wonder if you should consult a cardiologist. 

We had a short wait for our table, but were able to quench our thirst on soft drinks, punch, and sweet tea. The staff was extremely friendly. Everyone who works here seems to love it. 

I am a big fan of chicken. I am a big fan of waffles. Yet, I have never had them together. Thus, I decided the only choice for me was their No. 1 Meal, called KK's. Three (3!) pieces of fried chicken, 2 waffles, grits, and eggs w/ cheese and onions. I figured if I was going to eat at Lo Lo's, I was going to go for it. 

The food came pretty quickly. The first thing that struck me were the two enormous globs of butter (1 in my grits and 1 on my waffles). In all my life, I have never knowingly eaten this much butter in a single sitting. That being said, it was divine. Everything was delicious and, while I am not a big \"fried chicken\" guy, I must say that all three pieces disappeared quickly. Other members of our group sampled the fried okra and the red beans & rice. I heard nothing but happy sounds as our table of 7 made approximately 15,000 calories disappear. This was followed by groans and calls for afternoon naps as we all piled into our cars to go home. 

Lo Lo's is one of those experiences that should not be missed. But, make sure to clear your afternoon and, just to be safe, you may want to consult a health professional."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the LoLo restaurants, both Phoenix and Scottsdale. I've been eating there for about 8 years. Although the service has slipped in recent times, this new location is an all time disappointment.

This was my first and second time visiting the airport location. I had been waiting to see it open for almost a year. But I don't think I've ever been so let down by a restaurant.

First time (10/12/14, 1:05pm) : I had a 20+ minute wait, when I was originally told it would take 7-10 minutes to be ready. They forgot several items, the sweet tea wasn't great, the \"gravy\"... I'm not even sure what it is/was, and the chicken was just okay.

Second time (10/14/14 7:50pm): I had a much more reasonable 8 minute wait, but I was told it would only take about 3 when I placed my order. The sweet tea was good this time, the chicken was better this time but certainly not great, the gravy I won't be trying again (pretty sure it's from a can) and the waffle was bland and hard (either it had been sitting around or was over cooked)

My recommendation is to skip this place and go downtown. If this is a franchise then the charter needs to be revoked. If this is owned by Larry then I'm shocked."}
{"text":"So every time I come to Phoenix they keep saying go to Lo-Lo's. I came. I saw. I conquered. Food was all that!! Glad I came gere"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food here. The chicken and hot sauce were very good. The fried green tomatoes were a little bland but the crunchy coating was good dipped in ranch dressing. Fast service"}
{"text":"Chicken is great! No so much on the Mac $ cheese but I've never been too much a fan either. Service can be sketchy at times and a little TOO casual. Especially when a game is on. Why is it every single restaurant caters to the football/basketball crowd? It's annoying."}
{"text":"OMG- I cannot believe it's taken me this long to experience Lo-Lo's! Having lived in Phoenix for quite some time now, I find it very sad that I've just discovered the awesomeness that is Lo-Lo's, but now that I have I am happy to say I can go back whenever I want. 

I found the service to be very prompt and friendly. You could tell the people liked working here, and who wouldn't with access to some of the best waffles and chicken I've ever tasted. Now, I've been to Rosco's Chicken and Waffles in LA and I've got to confess, the chicken tastes similar at both. It is fried to perfection with just the right amount of seasonings. Where the two places differ, in my humble opinion, is the waffles. Lo-Lo's wins hands down in my opinion. The waffles are to DIE for! I don't know what it was, maybe the butteriness, maybe the syrup, or just the waffle batter, but man oh man was it good! We took home a piece for the red velvet cake and didn't get to it until 3 days later and it was pretty good... it probably would have been WAY better fresh that day, but we were TOO full to partake. 

Anyways, I can't wait to go back, but I've just got to lose the LBS I gained from the first meal- then I can return!"}
{"text":"Quick service on the go.  

I got the Betty's Boob (Chicken breast and a waffle) and a Banana Pudding for dessert.

I'm hoping this way just an off day for the chicken.  Dry and comparable to KFC.  With the reviews I'm reading, I think that's what happened.  

The banana pudding was scrumptious though.

I'll try again, but if the chicken is dry again, that's it."}
{"text":"my 1st time was there was totally horrible. The food and drink are so good , but there was a server guy who was EXTREMELY MEAN. I and my bf ordered 2 dishes and gotta wait almost 30mins (NO KIDDING). There were bunch of people who came after us , but they got their lunch just rite after 15mins. We were so mad and i called that young guy over to ask , then he told us that he would go and check. Seriously, the food were brought out rite after 1 min. Surely , the food was ready but he just didnt wanna bring them out maybe b/c of discrimination ( we're only asian at that time) .But we still keep coming back b/c we love the food."}
{"text":"Chicken is fresh and delicious! & the waffles are yummy! Kool-aid was a bit too sweet. DJ, and outdoor/indoor bar. Seating outside as well."}
{"text":"Soul Food virgin here. I was convinced that chicken and waffles could not peacefully co-exist, but Lo Lo's proved me wrong. 

My stomach was not built to handle fried food, I'll leave it at that. However if your stomach IS built to handle it, I'm assured that this chicken is fantastic.

I took the advice of other yelpers and ordered Sweet Tea with half un-sweet, and it was lovely. 

Love:
The Mason jars of \"drank.\"
The cinnamony waffles.
The friendly staff (all smiles, and quick to take care of you)
The casual/comfortable ambiance.
The menu items all nicknamed after, i assume, actual people.
The tender/spicy collard greens.

I'll be back, but I accept that fried chicken and I will have to agree to disagree. Thankfully, there's enough at Lo Lo's to keep my tummy full and happy."}
{"text":"Have to say not impressed at first.The hostess was awful.They were seating other people before us.Other people came and they got seated right away. But when we finally sat down and got something to drink and eat was amazing great fried gizzards extremely tender and flavorful.I would gave 5 stars but the hostess ruined it get better people working the front.By the way my waitress was awesome so friendly and fast. Also wish the parking was bigger."}
{"text":"Food here is almost always perfect.. The fried chicken is really good and the stupid fries are really good! The stupid fries are definitely something to share along with your own chicken and waffles.. Unless your a really big eater. Service is usually good but sometimes not so good. Overall I love this place."}
{"text":"Amazing! I can't wait to visit the Vegas location. Coming in off a plane straight from L.A I thought this place wouldn't match Roscoes. That was a lie! This place not only provided rest customer service, it was very tasty, fulfilling and full of flavor. 

We were seated in no time, served by a respectful & customer friendly guy named \"Sir\". Not only did he go out his way to give us the full LoLos experience he made sure everything was great the whole time. 

Thanks for showing this L.A girl that taste and soul runs all the way to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Flew in this morning from NorCal and needed breakfast. Saw this place on Yelp and since I always love Chicken' Waffles thought I'd try it. Staff was welcoming and so nice. Seated is right away. Ordered a Bettie's Boop, and when it came, the chicken was beautiful and the smell of the waffle was incredible. It was almost like a spice cake. Definitely cinnamon and nutmeg, but the taste was amazing.  The chicken was juicy and tender. Breakfast was hands down one of the best I've ever had. Will fly to Phoenix just for breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken around. Seriously, really great-tasting food. A few drawbacks, however. My friends and I went to this restaurant twice and each time ended up waiting over an hour for our orders to come out. Both times, the waiters and waitresses got our orders wrong, failed to bring silverware, weren't friendly, etc. So, I suggest calling ahead and picking up the order. I've done that several times now and they have it ready in 10-15 minutes. I haven't been there in a few months and it's possible their service has improved, but I'm not in a hurry to try eating in again. Nevertheless, delicious."}
{"text":"It's cheaper and better then roscoes . Only thing missing is the Hollywood sign and all the stars that line up to eat a $22 piece of chicken . Lolos sides are amazing and at $15 for a plate of four of them it's a good deal as it includes a giant corn bread biscuit . The home run for me is the number 13 Leg and thigh Mac n cheese $7 . Love the staff great job ."}
{"text":"Since there are already a gazillion reviews for LoLo's I will just say I had a super duper great experience at the LoLo's in Scottsdale.

The staff was the most delightful bunch of folks.  I sat at the bar and chit chatted with them listening to Michael Jackson and devouring Fried Chicken

Fried chicken.  Yes please, may I have another."}
{"text":"Went at 1pm with one of my girlfriends on a Friday, and it wasn't very crowded, so we got seated immediately. My friend and I weren't too hungry so we decided to share the #1(3 Chicken pieces, 2 waffles, grits, and eggs), and each of us got a jar of Kool-aid. The Kool-Aid here is seriously the bomb. I got the blue rasberry flavor which isn't too sweet, and has a lemonade flavor. The red fruit punch one is too sweet in my opinion. The eggs were scrambled with a perfect combination of onions and cheese. The chicken was hands-down the best fried chicken I have had in a while! It was juicy, crunchy, and perfectly flavored. I wasn't a big fan of the waffles though. It was too soft. I like waffles that are more crispy on the outside. 

The service was also exceptional. Our waiter would come by frequently to check on us. Overall this was a great experience, and I will definitely come here again even though it's a 30 minute drive from my house."}
{"text":"BEST fried chicken I've had out west (I'm from SC)! But terrible server-slow at every step of the way (hostess was fast). Didn't listen or care. I will come again because it reminds me of home and hope for better service next time."}
{"text":"Awesome place, First time in Phoenix and while my cousin was at work i decided to ride around the Scottsdale area, i was about to do a u turn to go to Panda Express when i seen something that say chicken and waffles so u know i had to check this out solo, i walk in and was very amaze in what i seen, almost immediately i notice the majority of the staff was black and it reminded me of home back in New Orleans, no complaints at all.  Anyway they ask me if the bar is cool i was like yes, when they ask me for a kool aid i was like no way, she show me the kool aid and i was wow fa real!! i receive a glass jar of kool aid. all smiles i got the number 3 i believe its call Lo's Lo's with 3pc and 2 waffles, now let me tell you i been to Roscoe's in Cali and Gladys Knights in Atlanta, and Gladys Knights got nothing on this, no disrespect ATL. the waffles taste just like Roscoe's waffles so u already know. I wore a waffle house t-shirt inside the store and trust me i will not be wearing that shirt in Lo's Lo's ever again. great place and the waitress showed me love with the flyer for her husband that cuts hair, appreciate the love. Lo's Lo's has my vote.

{"text":"I love this place, I actually prefer this one then the one in Scottsdale to be honest with you!!!! The only reason why it didn't get 5 stars was the outside part of it, as you wait to be seated, u can tell you are definaly on the Southside, with cars driving by real fast in the day time and of course the wait time is crucial but overall its straight!"}
{"text":"I've always avoided this place because of it's apparent stereotypical cultural views of African Americans and soul food in general. After I've sat and ate here I can assure you that this place is anything but a stereotype. That playdoh that they are trying to pass off as baked macaroni and cheese is disgraceful."}
{"text":"Oh boy....I thought I loved waffles.  Now, I will likely hate them.  Thanks Lo Los for making the most superb waffle I have ever had and ruining my baseline.   I'll not ever be able to cardboard box it again.  I'll not know what to order when I get suckered into going to Ihop.  And the only way I can now eat a true waffle is to go here or fly to Belgium and try to find that damned cafe which broke my baseline years ago.  The chicken you ask?  Maybe it was a bad day...or maybe I just really wanted another waffle. And forget the syrup...you'll ruin the perfection."}
{"text":"The Valley has a dearth of soul food, so I'm guessing that's the source of the hype for this place. It wasn't bad, I just found it underwhelming. I got the Lo-Lo, which is three pieces of chicken and two waffles. Chicken was ok, about what I could have made at home. Waffles were soggy. I went on a Tuesday afternoon, so no wait (I may have been slightly more annoyed if I waited an hour for soggy waffles and underseasoned chicken)."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. Restaurant has a great atmosphere and vibe. Service was a little slow and had to ask for silverware after food was served. Overall an okay experience."}
{"text":"At first when I was asked how many people and my answer was ten his first response was \"goddamn\". The service and food made up for a lot of it. The food was delicious and the service was wonderful. If you're ever in downtown Phoenix look for this place."}
{"text":"Based on the positive Yelp reviews we decided to give this place a try and were really disappointed.

First, I let my wife out on the curb to inquire how long the wait was, we were told 20 minutes so I found a place to park across the street and decided to wait the 20 minutes since we had came all the way from Goodyear. Stood waiting for 45 minutes and noticed people that came after us being seated so went up and looked at the waiting list and they had skipped us and been seating people after us with parties of 3 and 4 at tables with four chairs and left us waiting for one of the couple tables of only 2 chairs since there was only two of us. I got upset at the gal running the waiting list and she said \"you're next\" then proceeded to sit 4 more parties before us before we were finally seated at a table with 4 chairs since a table for 2 never opened up.

That was strike one.

Next, with the name \"Chicken and Waffles\" I expected to have some good waffles and figured they would be BIG. I ordered 3 chicken wings and 1 waffle for $10.50 and was very disappointed when this little thin waffle came out with 3 little tiny chicken wings. I get bigger wings when be buy fried chicken at the deli counter of Fry's grocery stores. I thought about ordering another waffle but seen they wanted $4 for just a tiny waffle and said screw that. I walked away still hungry.

The chicken had good flavor but the waffle was tiny and soggy and a frozen waffle out of box would have been just as impressive as this waffle.

We were at the place for nearly 2.5 hours and the bill for two of us was right at $30 for lunch and both of us were still hungry when we left. Not worth the price or the wasted time to eat here. Our waitress gave us our drinks and took our order and we never seen her again until she brought me the check as a runner brought the food from the kitchen."}
{"text":"I've worked downtown for years now and have always heard about this place. We went during lunch time and there was only valet parking, no regular parking which I thought was odd. You can park on the side street which we did but only after we waited on the single valet to park 2 cars that were blocking us. He was working hard but he was just the only valet there. Free but of course you gotta tip the guy. The chicken tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a bit or just wasn't made corrently. The homemade hot sauce is amazing. Like most down home fried chicken places they're a little expensive. We put in a order for the three of us to go and is was almost $50. Just standard 3 pc meals, not their most expensive plate options. This place is always packed and people rave about it so I don't want to say never go there but my individual visit wasn't what I hoped for. I may give it another shot because I love good home style friend chicken and hot sauce. Waffles were excellent though!"}
{"text":"Has Lo-Lo's lost its roots?

Super disappointed.  I love this place and I love soul food.  Been here many times.  However today was a real let down.  It was later in the day about 1:00pm on a Saturday.  Initially the restaurant was busy but not more then our previous trips.  We were told it would be a 25 minute wait to be seated for our party of six.  At about 35 minutes we asked how much longer and she said she was getting a table ready and even pointed to it.  She gave it away abut 15 minutes later.  We asked again.  Same thing.  At this point the restaurant was at about 50% capacity.  We got a table after reminding her again for a third time and then got our waitress who seemed to be on the same slow regimen as the hostess.  We put in our order.  Time slipped by and we told our waitress we were concerned.  The \"chef\" came out and I told him we were dissatisfied and he argued with me that the order had been put in 37 minutes earlier and they had a large party outside.  I told him we had been there for 90 minutes total in the restaurant and he was less then sympathetic.  In fact I felt he was quite put out by us.
Now I cook waffles at home and I'm sure the collard greens are made in large quantities before hand so I'm not sure even 37 minutes is necessary to get the food to the table and I believe the whole experience was a series of small errors in the flow from the hostess to the waitress to the kitchen but to deny there was an issue and blame it on us degraded the experience to the point where we cancelled our order and left hungry.

So how low can you go? Lo-lo's!"}
{"text":"My chicken breast was slightly dry, but it was still delicious!!!  The waffle was a bit to the touch, but I really liked the cinnamon flavor.

My dinner date's chicken thighs were juicy & delicious.  The sides: mac & cheese and collards were flavorful, but after seeing the next table order beans & rice, I am definitely going to try all the other side dishes for my next visits.

Their service was the best part of the meal! Every server offered that southern hospitality charm, and the manager walked around to check up on each table - first class!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is welcoming, friendly staff and pleasant atmosphere.  There is sports playing on the tv and some days there is live performance, tonight there was a singer and she was belting out the blues. The food is good southern comfort food, fried chicken, waffles, fried okra and fabulous sweet tea. I couldn't believe Scottsdale would have southern food. This restaurant is located right next door to my hotel, so it was easy access, and I didn't have to drive my vehicle in the traffic to get to this great restaurant."}
{"text":"What can be bad about fried chicken, waffles, Red Rooster hot sauce and a pile of Mac-N-Cheese?

Nothing!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I think I'm done with this location. Mostly due to the crap service I've received from the host staff. This last time I was standing in line to get my name on the list and somehow larger parties that came in behind me got put on the list before I was acknowledged at all despite being right there at the stand. I tried to say something, got a server's attention and not the hostess, she scribbled my name down on something, but it definitely wasn't the waiting list to be seated, so we left. Sorry I'm not a family of 7 and just a party of 2 (and white, I guess?).

Prior, it's been the same \"I've got better things to do than help you\" attitude, mostly from the female staff. Servers and host. Male staff is usually fine, so I'm not sure why there's an attitude there. Friends that have gone before also have noted the attitude of the female staff and it's not a case of \"if everyone you talk to is an a-hole, you're the a-hole.\"

Food quality can be hit or miss, too. Kool-Aid is far too sweet (universal across all locations) and I find myself ordering a water to dilute about 30-50% if I did order it. Breasts have been dry, except once. Thighs usually stay juicy, but I've had a couple dry ones as well. Pancakes are alright. Waffles seem like a pancakes in waffle form. Collard green are delicious. The banana pudding, though... That's going to be a hard one to break up with."}
{"text":"If you've never been you have to catch up with me I'm on a Roll they know my name now and regular table seating always"}
{"text":"I really like LoLo's.

They have very good food.  I can easily say that everything I've ever ordered at LoLo's has been delicious.

The sweet tea is as advertised.  When ordering the Kool Aid, I usually order it as half water, half Kool Aid as to not slip into a diabetic coma.

The prices are on par as far as soul food places go.

I do not mind waiting for good food, so I won't score negatively on that.

The wait staff is pretty attentive as far as the usual wait service goes.

I only have one complaint.  There have been a couple of times when there were a couple of unruly, obnoxiously loud (maybe even ungodly loud) people there while I was dining with my wife and 2 daughters.  They were using expletives and using language that had graphic sexual undertones.  Mind you, this was at a volume that was loud enough for everyone in the restaurant to hear.  The wait staff and management didn't even bother to ask them to simmer down and have some respect for the other patrons.  

I've always had really good dining experiences at LoLo's.  The staff is friendly, other than a couple of incidents, the other patrons are lively and provide a good dining atmosphere.  Other than the two times I mentioned, I thought this was a really good family restaurant.

I really do wish when incidents like this occur, that the wait staff or management steps up and ensures that a couple of people don't ruin the dining experience of everyone in the restaurant.  I am no stranger to eating in a loud restaurant where the level of noise is very high due to everyone having normal conversations.  The two times that I was unfortunate enough to go through this has actually kept me from going back.

There's no doubt I'll go there again.  I will crave their fried chicken and catfish enough to cross my fingers and give it another try.  It's just too bad that now, I can't trust the restaurant enough to bring my daughters there."}
{"text":"After waiting 20 minutes or so for a table the service at Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles was terrible. We waited 30 minutes before someone took our order and that was after I asked who was our server and then someone brought our drinks and said what else did we need the check? Sharonda and I both looked at him like he was crazy we haven't received our food yet!!!!! Look at the chicken it's dry and burnt! No tip for these clowns!"}
{"text":"I have wanted to eat here for years - glad I finally did. Liked the atmosphere. Chicken was good but a little dry. I had the waffles because of the name - they were okay."}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better service! Rachel and Charrae took great care of us! We definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get chicken and waffles and soul food! 

I've been here 3 times in the past month. LOL!  I normally order #9 the Lil Amadi  which includes an option of 1 thigh, 1 drumstick or 2 thighs & waffle which cost $7.  The chicken is perfectly fried and juicy. The waffle is often crispy and has a hint of cinnamon in it.

There is something about a bite comprised of fried chicken, buttered and syruped waffle with a dash of the Louisana hot sauce....sweet and spicy...Yum!!

My friend ordered the fried catfish and I was surprised that it was super moist and well seasoned and not greasy. I think I'll definitely get that next time I'm there.

Do yourself a favor and order their macaroni and cheese, (you'll thank me later). I think it is one of the best I've tried. It is creamy, cheesy and the elbow macaroni are soft but not mushy.

Also, their collard greens are surprisingly good. It actually has a kick of spice to it, but it works really well with the dark leafy earthy vegetable.

I've also tried their meatloaf which they have on special during part of the week. It is old fashioned style meatloaf and was flavorful and moist.

Service is anywhere from good to mediocre. Food comes out within 10-15 minutes. This place can get packed on the weekends during lunch."}
{"text":"I love the food but the service is not so good... I've only been there twice and I was hoping for my second time the service would be better but nope it wasn't. The food is so delicious but they take too long to even get your drinks.. we waited about 40min or more to get our food.."}
{"text":"I guess we went there with sky-high (and maybe unrealistic) expectations, but the food was only decent, service was slow and indifferent, and the restaurant seemed, well, a little dirty ... I mean it wouldn't kill anyone to grab a broom and sweep under the table before we sit down so I'm not squishing someone's old French fries under foot, would it?  Anyway, it was ok, but just barely."}
{"text":"It's not Rosco's and the menu is much smaller, but the food is good and not microwaved.
I liked it although the prices were a bit high for the portion sizes."}
{"text":"The only other chicken and waffles I've ever had was Roscoe's in LA and that was when I was still eating meat, so it'd a bit hard to compare, but here are my 2 cents.

This place is spacious and for a relatively big group, we didn't have to wait, which was good. The drinks come it large jars, which was cool. Everything on the menu is pretty straight forward - some kind of combination of waffles, chicken, eggs with side options. I got the waffle with eggs and a side of string beans and potatoes.

The eggs were mixed with cheese (yum!) and nice and fluffy. The string beans and potatoes were alright.. a bit overcooked but maybe that's the style. The waffle was heavier than usual and most everyone I was with agreed that the waffles were definitely not the strong point of the restaurant.

If I ever go again, I'd probably stick with some sides and eggs. No waffles please.

The disappointing part was that gravy wasn't included on most of the menu items! =("}
{"text":"Normally we love this place. We called at 1:10 to see how long the wait was and were told 20 mins. We arrived 15 minutes after calling. Saw a lot of empty tables and some dirty. Again was told 20 minutes. We sat down at the community table and asked to have a table cleaned off in the mean time. The hostess, a young male, had no desire to clean the table. Instead put two tables together. 
The waitress immediately took our drink and food order. She was awesome. The food took 35 minutes to come out. The waffles were so-so, but the chicken was amazing! Would I come back? Yes and be prepared to wait and not order waffles."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and ohh my goodness they have cool aid on tap. Say what!!!! Blue cool aid was awesome. When I come back to AZ I'm definetly stopping by."}
{"text":"First time here!

Happy that we got seated right away since it was so busy. I love the atmosphere and music very relaxed and family friendly.

At first I was looking at the 1st and second item on the menu... Sounds delish but so much food... Found a great compromise with Lil AmAdi (1thigh 1drumstick and 1waffle with a side of mac and cheese) perfect size! Maybe one more piece of chicken lol!

Im not a big fan of juices and such but the koolaid was pretty good. Love it i. The mason jars :) and the chicken oooooh the chicken! So crispy tasty and juicy mmmmhmm i love fried chicken! And waffle was great too it was pretty thin so very edible...im not drowning in waffle lol. Mac and cheese was so cheesy and delicious!

It was a great experience and I can't wait to go back! Service was awesome too!"}
{"text":"I had my first chicken and waffles experience at roscoes in los angeles before eating at this place.  Lo Los is by far the inferior choice.  The waffles were blah and the chicken wasnt anything to write home about.  Went out back for a smoke and overheard one of the cooks talking about how the owner doesnt care about the poor yelp reviews because theyre all made by \"white people with nothing better to do\"  Will never eat again at this place not only because of the bland food but because of the views of the owner.  Hope this place goes out to business."}
{"text":"Got in fast with a party of six, service was was good and polite. Food was great, all came out quickly and hot. The chicken fried chicken was great and so were the biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"I wish I could give ZERO stars for terrible service. To top it off they left me with no acknowledgement, explanation, or apologies when they knew they were wrong. This is not the way to run a business. Sad for them...I work at a huge fortune 200 & would have spread the word to the many coworkers who both live here and frequently travel to Phoenix for business. Lo Lo's loss"}
{"text":"I loooooooveeeeee lolo's. I'm there like every week.  I am a little bit sad to discover that they took away my favorite meal the little C. The gravy there is to die for I love the chicken gravy I go there and buy it so I can use it at home it is the best and haven't tried it you definitely have to try it another thing I would like to highlight is the endless mimosas on Sunday $13 Yes you heard me right I love the catfish they're the greens and the macaroni and cheese and the cornbread is so sweet and delicious"}
{"text":"This food was amazing!  Very authentic stuff.  Make sure to try the hot sauce. The only problem was service, some of the silverware was dirty. We kept reminding our servers to bring out plates, drinks, etc."}
{"text":"\"Best chicken! Great staff! Good ole southern fried! Juicy, crispy, just plain YUM!!\""}
{"text":"I've never been to either Lolo's location until today.  I'm not a huge fried chicken person, particularly not for breakfast, but i ordered up a Betty Boop and buckled in for the full experience.  Bottom line: best fried chicken I've ever had.  The waffle was pretty great as well.  I sampled two sides - the fried okra didn't knock my socks off, and by the time i got around to trying the mac and cheese, i was too full to appreciate the creamy cheesiness.  it was really good, though.  The service was great, I was quite pleased on that front.  I was a tad worried that a great local place that knows that they've really made it would have a bit of an attitude, but i didn't get any of that from the people who served our table.  five stars on that front (other than the fact that the drink orders were served to the middle of the table - i don't consider that a deal-breaker).
Speaking of drinks, I recall a recent \"twitter\" or status update in which someone noted that she was looking for a bathtub full of ice cold lemonade or something similar.  I'm fully prepared to go a few steps farther.  I would willingly give up seafood if all the world's oceans were made of Lolo's ice cold Arnold Palmer, in perfect proportion.  It's that good.  And it can't be much more sticky than the nasty saltwater those oceans have now, right?  plus that stuff tastes disgusting.

anyway, i cannot tell you how excited i am for the night hours that begin next friday at this location only.  every friday night, this Lolo's will re-open at five and remain open until THREE the next morning.  I don't care if I have to walk from downtown phoenix (where i usually do most of my weekend drinking), the people-watching here is going to be epic.  (oh, wait, those are the people i came in with.  funny i don't recognize them in the light...)  i can't wait."}
{"text":"I just ate here on Wednesday night, and like always the food was amaz! Everyone there is so friendly and nice. Our Waitress was on top of everything and really sweet. I always enjoy this yummy comfort food!"}
{"text":"Love this place! i have been to Scottsdale location as well and both have surpassed my expectations . Pretty big portions and large beverages! will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Finally decided to find out the latest rave of finger licking goodness....
My daughter and I had a half hour wait and was finally seated...approximately 15 minutes later we received menus and asked if we would like to order beverages. We did order drinks and green fried tomatoes along with fried chicken gizzards .The beverages were delivered pronto but the appetizers were just a memory,  they finally arrived and the server apologized and told us she added some fried green beans because of the long wait. We got a million green beans but only four tomato slices, lot of gizzards too.
I had to ask our server for plates and that's all we got, no eating utensils or napkins , I assume she thought it was finger licking good, it wasn't,  every thing was luke warm and tasteless. 
I ordered two chicken thighs along with beans and rice. The wait was long too, about another 45 minutes. I've had better chicken from Churches or the larger grocery store deli chains.The beans and rice was another bad choice I've made in my life.
My daughter had the same with macaroni and cheese, nothing to wow about either.
The server asked us how we liked everything when we were halfway through. I lied and said it was fine. Total time from bring seated to leaving was approximately 3 hours. Service was slow.
There's a old saying , \" Don't count your chickens before they hatch \", We'll, I did and I was disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't have the heart to give this place anything less than 3 stars because they're just so damn nice, but I found Lolo's to be sub-par. I really don't get the hype. 

I ordered fried catfish, mac & cheese, cornbread, sweet tea, and a waffle. the catfish was bland and pointless. it just tasted like salt. season your food, dammit! maybe if I wasn't from Louisiana & had never had good catfish, I might have enjoyed it, but my standards are high, and unfortunately Lolo's did not deliver. I know I sound like a total snob, but it just wasn't good.

the cornbread was unnaturally yellow, almost neon, and it came already smothered in fake-tasting butter stuff. bleh.

the waffle tasted like it was made of air, so if you're into that kind of thing then you'll love em. I like waffles when they're somewhat crispy, so I was disappointed.

the mac & cheese was also pretty bland & pointless, and the noodles were overcooked. ALSO, there was a weird chunk of what looked like meat in it, which I did not appreciate finding.

the tea was pretty good. it comes in a gigantic mason jar, and it's sweet but not too sweet.

oh, and the ambiance is fucking terrible! turn some lights out, for goodness' sake!

all in all, I don't get it. the chicken must be really good, because there's nothing about this place that would make me want to return."}
{"text":"Went for lunch 11:15.  The Place was mostly empty.  Set me at the front door and by the hostess stand.  I asked for a table out of the traffic.  They said NO.. this or the bar.  I left.   KFC was great and you can get mashed potato's, that you can't at Loser / Loser's"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely ridiculous. So delicious. I came in for only fried chicken and it was so tasty. I had dark meat and it's right up there with the best of ever had. And the service is just as comforting as the food. I really love this place. Deonna come back for the waffles another time. Their buttered corn was delicious as well. I also love the ENORMOUS Iced Tea they give you."}
{"text":"LoLo's ain't no Roscoes. Recommended by a friend to visit this chicken and waffles establishment- let's see how it compares to Roscoes chicken and waffles. LoLo's is more like a Chili's. Ambience is kinda sports bar/ hooters hip hop chain restaurant trying too hard to be hipster but also trying to appeal to the family diners. Chicken is well fried but lacks a little spice or kick. Waffle was too thin and limp to hold up to the chicken. Cole slaw was tangy and vinegary- was legit.  Overall a tasty meal, but not worth standing in line for."}
{"text":"This was sooo good.  It was one the recommendations from our hotel.  It was a little out of the way for us and there was a bit of a wait, but it was worth it.

They have a great menu for everyone with any appetite.   I would warn you, this is not a place for those on a diet.  It is great down home, soul food cooking at it's finest.  Order a few things to get a sample, but you obviously have to get chicken and waffles.... they are good, really good.  The chicken was crispy and moist.  The waffle was the size of my plate.  It was light and fluffy.  A little maple syrup... some hot sauce... Heaven I tell you!  I was so happy.

The mac and cheese was good... not great.  The corn bread was dense, but not overly so. The sweet tea was a bit too sweet and needs to be cut.  My wife ordered the salad.  It was delicious.  They were generous with the chunks of fried chicken and other toppings, with a nice portion of mixed greens.

This was one of the best meals I have had in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Long wait, even longer wait for the food. Maybe because it is Sunday, not sure but as we walked out there was still a crowd of people waiting.  One nice thing...I ordered a peach vodka iced tea drink (not sure about the name), and it was bomb. I was way tipsy off that one drink! Maybe that's their plan; get you drunk so you don't notice how long your food is taking. As far as the food, we shared a couple of plates of chicken and waffles, greens and  grits. Grits were bland. Greens were great.  Chicken and waffles were good. I'm from SoCal so I've had Roscoe's chicken and waffles.  They both tasted about the same."}
{"text":"This place is alright for being in the airport.  I'm sure their main location is a bit better.

The chicken was delicious, but the waffles left more to be desired.  They were a bit soggy.  Not sure if they are always like that or if they were undercooked."}
{"text":"Love the fried chicken!! It's cooked just right and with the tasty waffle with a hint of cinnamon mmmmm. I always get the Betty Boob with some kool-aid and today it's grape flavor. Not only is the food amazing but the employees are courteous and friendly.  Can't wait for their Gilbert location to open up, closer to home."}
{"text":"This is a place I make sure I go back to every time I travel to Phoenix. Dang good fried chicken, friendly staff, and good bumping music. I haven't tried the waffles yet but my boyfriend recommends getting it with the honey butter. Must try the gravy with onions! A lot of seating and an extension of parking across the street"}
{"text":"Over-priced sub-par food.   My kids could barely eat the Mac & Cheese......a real rarity because that is their \"go to\" food of choice.   My chicken was dry and greasy.   Never again.... I could not wait to get out!"}
{"text":"First of all I want to say that I've been a faithful Lolo's customer for years and have brought many friends and family along with me on my many trips. BUT I was very disappointed with my most recent visit today. We were seated fairly quickly since we got there early to beat the lunch rush (11:15). Our waitress came and took our drink order. From the painfully slow speed in which she did everything it was very obvious she wasn't in a hurry to do ANYTHING! We got our drinks then the horribly long wait for our food began. It took 45 minutes from the time we order until we got our food. I have NEVER had to wait that long!! Our drinks were only refilled once they had been completely empty for some time. Sadly I don't think I will ever return to Lolo's."}
{"text":"So disappointed in today's visit. The food was excellent as always: but the service was the worst I've ever had at any Lolos establishment. (I've been to three)
First, I watched the hostess sit 2 different groups of her friends that came in after me and two elderly couples that checked in prior. Kind of disheartening when you're looking at a 45 minute wait. 
Second, we waited 30 minutes for our food. I didn't mind, I know good food takes time. The problem I had was that the entree that arrived was not as I expected it to be. WTF is chef's choice??? The explanation I was given, was \"We serve whatever is available. Unless you specify that you want what is on the menu.\" Shady as hell!!!
Me and my very special guest ate and enjoyed our Chef's Choice... It's just disappointing that this great food is partnered with such poor service. I have always taken visiting friends and family to Lolos, and recommended it to my coworkers and their families: but I will have to rethink that now. We will definitely not be back to the downtown location."}
{"text":"Man, what can I say? My family and I really really enjoy going to Lolo's, but yesterday's experience was awful. And it was meant to be a celebration for my wife and I because of our new baby and we just got out of the first ultrasound. There were hardly any people there and it was like 3pm & service was extremely fast, but then it went downhill from there. There was this really skinny server girl that dropped a fork, then went to get it, but dropped another fork, then when she went to get that, another one dropped. I felt bad but then she said, \"If I drop another goddamn fork!\" I understand her frustration, but being a follower of God, that was a bummer to hear. The same girl went to grab a plate from my table and dropped it, which is an accident so I wasn't trippin, but she grabbed plate and didn't even clean up the food that fell off of it. Our server was a very cool dude, but felt like he was rushing us out. He came with food quick, but also came with the bill quick and didn't offer refills on drinks or dessert. When I asked him if I could get a refill, he said he'd put it in a go cup, but we never said we were going. Then that same skinny girl started yelling right next to my table at another Mexican girl server across the room about $2 that she owed her. It was a friendly yell between two friends, but it was ghetto as heck. I wanted to be like, girl, you are at work, be professional. Then lastly, my meal cost roughly $36 and I gave $40. The receipt said $3.36, but he gave me an even $4 in change, which is stealing from the owner and the main reason I'm writing this. I'm not sure if it was laziness or he thought he was doing me a favor, but it wasn't cool at all. Lolo's always felt like a fantastic place to eat with friendly servers. It's not a suit and tie place, but the service was professional. Yesterday felt like I was at the waffle house because of employee behavior. We will for sure go again, but I'm praying the employees step their game up otherwise Lolo's will probably lose some customers"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum!!!

I've heard about this place for years and recently had the chance to give it a try. Wow, some of the best fried chicken I've ever had combined perfectly with crispy waffles and topped off with syrup and LoLo's own hot sauce. 

Service was very friendly and the facility was really nice, very welcoming and comfortable. Yes, you have to drive a little further South on Central Avenue than some people find comfortable, but its well worth it.

If you're looking for great comfort food, give LoLo's a shot!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible, asked for the manager and he couldn't attend to us because he was on the line cooking. I tipped my waitress because it was the right thing to do, but they should consider putting her in the back to wash the dishes because she had no sense of urgency to attend to her tables. But there was one girl who wasn't waiting on tables, that should train the slow a** waitress I had. She was bussing tables, dark skin young lady with braids!! Loved how attentive she was to keeping the restaurant clean. 

As for the food, it could of been better. I only ate it because I was extremely hungry after waiting 1hr and 15mins for my food and the Mimosa was AAAMMMAAZZINNNGGGG !!"}
{"text":"I want to love this but it just wasn't great. It knew it would be a heart attack on a plate in exchange for a decadent fried chicken dinner. The chicken was dry and I have had them in the past and it was much better. I will go back to see if it was just a one time oops."}
{"text":"Lolo's gets 5 stars for the waffles alone. The chicken is irrelevant to me. They could call it Lolo's Waffles & I'd be there all the time.

The sweet potatoes, and the corn on the weekends are great too. The chicken & eggs are also tasty, but merely an afterthought to those delicious waffles.

Lolo's is great at responding to their customers on Twitter, and service at this location has always been really friendly. Get there before 10AM on the weekends for a quick table.

They are not open past 3PM except on Fridays, which is a good thing, because if they were my ass would be twice as big.

I love you Lolo's, keep making those amazing waffles."}
{"text":"Dealing with the staff is NOT worth the food. 

This used to be my favorite place a few years ago, but after the long waits when dining in I decided to only get carry out. Love their red velvet cake and ordered one 24 hours in advance for my birthday. We came it pick it up 20 mins after they were supposed to have it ready, to find out the bakers never got the order. Was told it would be ready in 5 mins by one staff member, so we waited 10. Only then to be told by the actual baker that it would take at least an hour. He was apologetic and said since we couldn't pick up the cake until after my party (since I wasn't going to leave my own birthday party to come back a second time) was told there would be no charge. So one of my guests picked up a second cake at another bakery just so I would have one. When I came back to Lolo's, the cake was ready, and I asked if the $90 I already paid for it when I placed the order the day before was credited as I was told earlier in the day that it would be. After waiting 12 minutes for the manager to check on it, I was told I was wrong, no one told me it would be free, and they'll only credit me $20. After explaining my situation, and that the cake we had to buy to replace the one they didn't have ready in time was almost $50, that I would be fine if they credited me that amount instead of the whole $90. By the time the manager was done arguing with me, I was furious. And after we finally agreed on a 50% discount for dealing with all of their mistakes and misinformation, he even shorted me $5 when he credited back my card! All in all I spent almost an hour in two separate visits on my birthday and ended up having to argue with a senior staff member just to pick up a cake I had ordered a whole day in advance while getting less than half the credit I was promised. 

And the cake wasn't even as good as I remembered!!!!

Total fail, will avoid like the plague and tell everyone I ever hear mention Lolo's name that there are much, MUCH better soul food restaurants in town where you don't walk out of there feeling like you want to punch everyone who works there."}
{"text":"food was not fresh; horrible service; fried okra was undercooked; fried chicken was old and the fried fish's batter was stale; worst soul food I've ever tasted; food was not seasoned - greens were from the can, mac and cheese was not baked"}
{"text":"Love me some LoLo's and even more with their new Scottsdale store More seating is a definite plus. Of course it's nothing like the mom n pop feel of the downtown location but I still love em!

The wait is typical on Saturday morning but that just meant that I was starved enough to finish my entire meal this time. The chicken did taste a bit healthier... meaning there was less oil on my plate. Should I really be complaining about this? Haha.

I got my grape Kool-aid, my fried chicken and waffle on... life is good."}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's is a no-no for the heart but a yes-yes for the soul.

When I'm on one of my many diet plans that have a cheat day or a reward day, Lo-Lo's is usually where I got to make up for lost calories. If you've never had chicken and waffles together, its a delightful combination but don't expect it to a miraculous union. It simply is fried chicken and waffles, you just happen to be eating them simultaneously.

My favorite part about Lo-Lo's are the dranks. They are served in large mason jars can choose from the standard fountain drinks, sweet tea or red and grape kool-aid. Yes, red is a flavor. 

I heard the red velvet cake is amazing but I've always been so full to get to dessert. Maybe the next cheat day..."}

Chicken and Waffles, grits, greens, fried eggs with cheese and onions, Sweet tea and corn bread.  All Good.  Service is usually good, hit ot miss here but the food in great all the time.

There is a location in Scottsdale too."}

Complete out of towner and I stopped here after a bodybuilding show! I must say I was thoroughly surprised! 
Cute mom and pop kinda feel, not sure if it's a giant chain, but If so I didn't get that feel! 
The chicken was heaven! 
I ordered chicken and waffles and man it was quite delicious! 
My friend ordered catfish and I had to dip into that!!! I felt like I was in the south! Man it's hard to find places that really nail Cajun and southern style food, but they did it! 

ORDER THE KOOL AID while you're there it was so sugary just like when you made it as a kid!
I can't wait to go back!!!!"}

waited almost 2 hours to take my first bite. but aside from that, it was great."}
{"text":"Waited the 10-15 minutes for a table, the hostess had a booth available, we stated that we preferred a booth, the hostess let us know that she was giving it to a bigger party, we looked around and several of the booths only had two in their party, needless to say we didn't stay. I'm not a big fan of spending my  money somewhere where I'm uncomfortable. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"First stop from the airport on Thursday. Directly to LoLo's. I saved my appetite from NJ to AZ just for this restaurant!! Boy we were not disappointed!! Carl, the waiter, took excellent care of us. He was helpful, polite, and patient. His choices of food were outstanding!! With so many opportunities to choose from off the menu, we couldn't decide so we ordered a little of everything. Everything was finger licking good! Especially the collard greens, chicken, and home fries. The half and half (tea and lemonade) 2 thumbs up!! 
We came a second time for lunch on Saturday and Aaron had the pleasure of waiting on us. Service was good, no long waits, food came out at a reasonable time, and Aaron was attentive and took care of all of our needs. 
We need a LoLo's in NJ:("}
{"text":"Great Food and a great atmosphere for dining with groups. Typically the restaurant is pretty loud during busy hours. Also they have a live DJ who mostly appropriate music that all guest can enjoy. The restaurant has a country/industrial theme. The outside seating area is nice for when you wait, which is almost guaranteed if you come for dinner especially on weekends. A big bonus is the restaurant has valet parking that is free (but please tip). I suspect it could be because the fence on north side is always being hit by customers. The parking lot is not large enough to accommodate the restaurant when at full capacity. Addition parking is on the neighborhood streets or across the street and industrial building. Most of staff are young and spirited. Service: it's not what I wish it would be. Food comes out at various times, which can be annoying if you get your food and you party gets theirs 15 minutes later. This seem to be more so with parties of 4 or more. The managers are pretty stiff and rigid. Definitely not \"the customer is always right\" type. They are not friendly and spunky like the waiters. They're expanding by adding locations at a face pace due to them franchising the restaurant. Hopefully they can get the customer service level up and earn the fifth star. Lastly the crowd is very diverse at all times. Black owned and operated which is a plus for me."}
{"text":"Lots of hype for nothing. I've had better waffles, chicken, grits, etc. elsewhere. The service and staff there were upbeat and fun. I'm glad I didn't have to wait. If you want to try it, go early for breakfast."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

My favorite hole-in-the-wall comfort food in south Phoenix. While this ain't no Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles, Lo-Lo's is a decent Arizona cousin. Most of the time, I can't bring myself to support such a rip on an original restaurant idea that's been made to seem like it's the only one of its kind, but in my four years in Arizona, I have to admit I've gobbled up many calories here. 

Don't let the neighborhood or the space keep you away. It's a little on the dingy side, but the people are the nicest around and they're super helpful. Obviously, you'll want to get chicken and waffles. The chicken is crispy and flavorful, but it differs from Roscoe's because it is sometimes dry-- I go for the white meat, which usually stays a little juicier. The waffles are good, but they're not the best. They get the job done, but lack the cinnamon-y flavors of Roscoe's. I usually get a side of home-fries, which are sometimes amazing, sometimes just average, and a big jug of red cool aid. 

I'm usually pretty stuffed by the time dessert rolls by, but word on the street is, they've got a decent red velvet cake. Park on the street, but make sure to read the signs/ lock your doors. Just a short drive to South Mountain if you want to work that meal off up the Kiwanis Trail!"}
{"text":"Pretty bummed to give my experience tonight 2 stars, as I usually rate both the food and service at Lolo's a 5. Unfortunately, with limited food to choose from and slow service (despite the feeling we got that everyone working was just trying to go home and not be bothered) - tonight was the exception. 

We had butts in the booth at 9:59 tonight, and as the waitress handed us menus we were told they only serve chicken and waffles after 10 pm. NO sides - no eggs - nothing but chicken and waffles. Couldn't even get a salad. Fine, except that the table immediately ahead of us was able to order whatever they wanted, and we were the only other table waiting to order. Seriously, guys? The cut-off is THAT strict? We could HEAR that family order. That's BS. Not to mention, since all we had to choose from was chicken and waffles, why waste our time by giving us menus? Y'all. Get it together. 

Then, 20 minutes AFTER we put our order in (which was at 10:05 btw), a server delivers mac-n-cheese to a different table. Tell me again why you can't send a side over to our table at the same time? Smh. 

Somewhere between being charged for a lemonade we didn't order and it taking forever for the waitress to come back for our checks, I lost a little faith in Lolo's. I usually eat a lot earlier and now that I know about it, the limited menu after 10 won't be an issue for me. I just won't come then. 

The service tonight WAS an issue, along with the fact that their \"after 10\" policy seemed inconsistently enforced. Before tonight, I never hesitated to recommend Lolo's. Now, I have to add my own \"after 10\" disclaimer to match how awful theirs is."}
{"text":"Unlike a lot of the reviews I didn't have to wait, go on a Tuesday night people! The food was great, I loved all the different options for sides. Cheesy eggs as a side?!? Genius! And who can say no to fried gizzards, just make sure to ask for some hot sauce to go with it and you're all set!"}
{"text":"I always though chicken and waffles sounded like a horrible combination until I went to Lo Lo`s and tried it. It`s awesome (at least in Lo Lo`s). Great place to eat unless you are on a diet and looking for something healthy. The Burgers are good also, but my favorite dish is the Shrimp & Grits. Only drawback is somewhat slow, but still courteous service."}
{"text":"This place is not all the hype! 

Chicken was a little greasy. Sides were bland. Really the \"eggo\"-ish waffles were not great either. The grape kool-aid was all sugarfied! 

Tip: Go to Church's chicken and make your own waffle."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today to see about the hype. My mom and I wanted to try something new. Very friendly staff with very fun attitudes. Food was delicious (I didn't get waffles this time) But I got the soul food plate with chicken, whipped potatoes, a biscuit and mac n cheese. It was very good and a GIANT plate. I had to take most to go. After, we shared a banana pudding with fresh bananas in every bite. The price was not bad at all for the quality of the food and the places stayed packed the whole time between 4:30 & 6pm. You can check in online for less of a wait. ;)"}
{"text":"I ordered a 3 piece chicken with mac&cheese to go. It was a bit pricey, but very clean location, quick service, and didn't smell like grease! If you're a Mac & cheese lover I'd skip it for a different side. It was a bit on the mushy side and flavorless. The corn bread and collard greens are GREAT...chicken was average."}
{"text":"So good!!! Can't say it enough. Tastes like home cooking. You will not leave disappointed, guaranteed."}
{"text":"The food here is top notch, don't know where to find better chicken and waffles. I keep coming back, but there's something wrong when I have bad service over half the time.

I don't know what the deal is, but on more than one occasion we've had unpleasant waiters/waitresses. I don't ask for much at restaurants, but reflling water or asking for a couple more minutes to look at the menu should not warrant a skank face. Maybe the serving staff had a bad day... multiple times... during the same week...

Eh, who knows. I guess that makes it a \"legitimate\" Southern experience, but regions don't excuse poor service. I suggest going for the classic combo, but don't be surprised if things go south from there..."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I am a fan. I do enjoy their chicken and waffles entry. If am not craving that I will get fried chicken, yams and mac n cheese with my all time favorite Kool-Aid. 

I feel like the Kool-Aid is a bit too sweet...but its so addicting I just keep chugging. The food is good...seating is fast and the staff is polite. 

I will be returning :)"}
{"text":"Do NOT come here when you are on a diet!! This food is rich and delicious! I can see what the hype was all about. Definitely come here on one of your \"cheat\" days :)"}
{"text":"I am sad to say that Lo-Lo's has gone downhill in my opinion. I started with the original location downtown, then I was happy when a location opened in my neighborhood in South Scottsdale. I have been living out of the country since summer 2011, & was excited to see the new bigger location in Old Town.

I decided to go in for a meal today, & the food was still good, but not as good as I remembered. The real disappointment was the service. I wasn't acknowledged when I walked in. I looked around, & decided to eat at the bar. There was an older guy behind the bar. He didn't even say hi, until someone else told him I was there. Then he started to take my order, walked off with no explanation, then came back to say they were out of it earlier, but they had it now. Ok great. I was ready to finish my order, but he walked off & greeted other customers & started telling them about happy hour. I was shocked. I reminded him that I hadn't finished ordering, & so he came back. I can honestly say I have never had an ordering situation like this before in my life. Then he never came back. Someone else ran my food out, & he seemed to be leaving for the day.

I totally get that it must have been the end of his shift, but he could have at least checked on my food & told me he was moving my tab over. He still hung out for a bit to chat with other employees, so it's not like he was rushing out. The lady who took over, was nice & gave decent service.

My bill came to just under $30 for a lemonade, one happy hour cocktail, & a chicken meal. Frankly I could get the same meal elsewhere with better service for less. It's sad to see that Lo-Lo's has become this."}
{"text":"While I was waiting for my food at the counter, I had to try the last piece of red velvet cake that had been staring me down and calling my name. Verdict: the BEST Red Velvet cake I have ever tasted!!!

But I digress, my first taste experience upon entering Lolo's this Sunday morning with my husband, was the refreshing homemade lemonade served in a large mason jar. It really is the best lemonade, better than any I have ever had the pleasure to drink, even my own homemade lemonade does not compare.  I quickly downed half a jar and then was promptly offered a refill. 
Customer service is alive and well at Lolo's. 
What brough us to Lolo's was the fried chicken, so needless to say we were filled with anticipation and can tell you that it is worth the trip. It is the best fried chicken west of the Mason/Dixon line! The mac and cheese was wonderful as were the sweet potatoes. Let's not forget the grits...yummy! The corn muffin was the \"icing on the cake\" (if you don't count the scrumptious red velvet cake icing!)

We drove home and promptly devoured the red velvet cake and then took a nap. In short, a perfect way to spend a lazy Sunday. 

Starting September 11th they will serve dinner and be open until 3:00AM"}
{"text":"Came to Lo Lo's to see what all the hype is about. I've been to Roscoe's multiple times and wanted to see if it compared. Truthfully I was not impressed with this experience. Came with a party of 6 for Sunday morning brunch. We had an hour wait which surprisingly was a little bit faster then quoted  which was great. I got the chicken breast and waffle and a side of Mac and cheese which Is generally my usual at Roscoe's. The waffle was thin and smelled fresh and yummy. The chicken was in the small side which is fine for me seeing as I still had a whole waffle and Mac and cheese. When I tasted the chicken it was extremely dry. My sister's chicken wasn't as dry as mine, but still I was a little disappointed. With each bite I took I was in need of a beverage to wash it down with. Unfortunately, I got sweet tea and that was hands down the most disgusting sweet tea of my life! The saying \"Would you like some Tea with that Sugar\" comes to mind. I had to dilute it with water and even then I couldn't drink the pure sugar... We get it, you serve over sugared homemade drinks... But seriously, You're better off getting water or soda which both options contain less sugar then their sweet tea or kool-aid. Anyway, When they initially brought out our food they didn't bring out my side, I asked the waiter about the Mac and he apologized and said it would be out right away. A few minutes later he asked if I ever got it and said he would get it himself; in which he did and was super apologetic about it. He was a sweet guy. The Mac and cheese was plain, it tastes doughy to me, almost bland. The waffle was okay, I put light syrup and ate it, I don't have much to rave about for it was just a regular waffle... I still prefer a Waffle House waffle or Roscoe's... 
My cousin got chicken smothered in gravy, I tasted the gravy and it was pure amazingness! I instantly wished I would have ordered it. The gravy tastes like bell peppers and other spices, very yummy! 
My other family members ordered the chorizo plate which was a big serving alongside tortillas which everyone tasted and loved. Also, another family member got the biscuits and gravy. Another must, the serving size was big and the biscuits were on point! 

Parking is. Pain, they have a small lot but you can park a block away in the neighborhood. The location inside is clean and decorated very nice and authentic looking. I've read other reviews and hears the service sucks, so I guess we got lucky And got some great help. 

Do I recommend it? Meh, I would say sure Go it if you want to try it out. Specifically my food was not that good but from everyone else's food I tried it was good, and I personally would come back only to try their other dinner options...  For chicken and waffles I'll stick to my local Roscoe's."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Lo Lo's for years and never really had a gripe until today when I place a to go order.  It's not that they make you prepay.. I understand that in today's world.  My go to at Lo Lo's has always been the soul food platter with catfish, chicken breast, greens and Mac and cheese, tons of food and I usually take quite a bit home.  Sometimes I opt for a veggie plate which is generally a ton of food.  That is until today when I ordered a veggie plate to go.  Four sides and a cornbread $16 out the door.  I've never complained because of the quality as well as quantity.  Today when I picked up my order I thought to myself DAMN that bag seems awful light.  Well it was four 1/2 pint containers about half full...Seriously LoLo's WTF???  And the strings beans and red potatoes side were green beans straight out a can a maybe two pieces of potatoes.  Mac and Cheese has become hit and miss.  Not happy today guys.  You can't get too big, and start screwing things up...I'm sure I'll be back but probably for dine in only.  I feel extremely ripped off today!"}
{"text":"Sad when told unable to check-in early via phone, impressed with yelp sign in ahead. Waiter was delightful. My family's food looked amazing. Half way through their meal I HAD to ask the manager where my meal was. So needless to say my meal came out when they were done eating. My meal and drinks were free, although that was not the point. We go to dinner to eat as a family, to eat together. Sadly, this is not the first time that this happened to me here. I will never not give credit where it's due. The food is delicious, but my experience was displeasing."}
{"text":"Well, my 1st time and wow! Got 3 legs (drums) and 2 cornbreads (huge buttered up cornbreads! YUM!)  The hot sauce to go with it almost made the chicken taste like big wings...should've busted out the blue cheese dressing.  Definitely worth checking out if you love Southern food."}
{"text":"Good food.  Not the best waffle but everything else I had was tasty.  I would come back."}
{"text":"Good service. Good food. Still thinking of those fried green tomatoes . Parking is a little challenging. Good luck"}
{"text":"Huge portions. A little out of control to be honest. If you're staying in downtown Phoenix, then I suggest you do the 30 minute one way walk. 

Grits were exactly how they listed them- plain. With a slab of margarine. I prefer butter. And they really were gritty no smoothness. Eggs were fried in margarine as well. So I'd stay away from it next time. 

A lot of carbs: waffles were soggy. They need to stand up to the chicken but didn't. Brother ordered the biscuits and they were giant fist sized and smothered in gravy. 

Chicken with their hot sauce was the best thing there. Definitely would advise to stick with just the chicken unless you're a fan of margarine and/or massive amounts of carbs. I love the concept of chicken and waffles (live in LA with the famous Roscoe's, which I don't recommend either) but the waffles always seems to disappoint. It's chicken and waffles. Not chicken with pancakes. 

Parking is plentiful. Also have a bike station around the corner if biking is more your thing than the walk/drive. 

Remember: food adventures are out there. So eat 'em up and report back to me! :)"}
{"text":"I don't see why everyone is raving about this place. I have had better chicken and waffles at Caferteria 15L. The chicken here reminded me of KFC chicken, aside from being crispy I didn't see very spectacular. Also when I got the waffle it wasn't as crispy and delicious as I wanted. It came with plenty of syrup and butter but that didn't mask my disappointment. I think this place is just overrated and I would not be back again."}
{"text":"Fried Chicken, Mac and Cheese, Red Velvet Cake and Kool-Aid!
Now that's my kind of breakfast.
 
Lolo's Chicken and Waffles is a small joint located in a not so lovely residential area of Phoenix . Don't let the surrounding area fool you though, inside this small Soul food joint you will find some delicious eats. The inside of Lolo's has a very homey look and feel. Their menu is full of different Soul food fare. The coolest thing about Lolo's is that their entire menu is offered all day. If you want breakfast for dinner, you can. If you want dinner for breakfast, go for it. It's awesome!
 
My fiancé and I both ordered their KK's breakfast, which consisted of three pieces of fried chicken, two waffles (we both added pecans to our waffles), cheese grits and scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese and onions. We also got a side of Mac and cheese, Yams, sausage patties and a slice of red velvet cake. My father ordered their fired chicken omelet, which was made with fried chicken, bell peppers, onions and cheese. Everything that we ate that morning was excellent. The fried chicken was really juicy and flavorful, especially the dark meat. The waffles were light and fluffy and packed full of pecans. The yams were really sweet and had a nice cinnamony flavor. Their sausage patties, which they make in house, were some of the best I have ever had. The Mac and cheese was really cheesy and gooey. The grits were also really cheesy and also really buttery. My dad's omelet was delicious. They made his omelet with four eggs and loaded it with juicy fried chicken (skin and all) and lots of grilled veggies. They also topped it with a ton of shredded cheese. The red velvet cake, which we took to go, was really moist. The cream cheese frosting, which was covered with pecans, was not overly sweet and was really creamy. To wash down all this yummy grub I had a huge glass of super sweet cherry Kool-Aid. My fiancé and dad both had their sweet tea, which was just as sweet as their Kool-Aid.
 
The service here was great. Our waitress was really funny and friendly. She was shocked to see us order so much food, especially at 10am. She joked around with us the whole time and always kept my mason jar of Kool-Aid filled to the brim. The prices here were great too.
 
If you like Soul Food and happen to be in the Phoenix area then you have to check out Lolo's. This place rocks!"}
{"text":"It is 10:45 AM and I am hungry. I didn't have breakfast, it is too early for lunch and I am trying to decide whether I want to pull into a breakfast place or a lunch place, then I see the sign that says \"Lo Lo's Chicken and Waffles\" !!. I go inside thinking  I will probably just order lunch but ........ waffles seem to come with most of the choices and besides I am in a Chicken and Waffle house so I order 2 drumsticks with waffles. 

The place is clean with friendly and happy looking staff. My food comes and I bite into the drumstick. It is lightly battered (not overly) and is a little crispy on the outside but tasty and juicy! The waffles are light and you get lots of butter and syrup! I have a bite of breakfast followed by a bite of lunch, this is still a strange combo but very tasty!! 

I leave thinking that will will come back again but, I am still confused, \"Did I just have breakfast or was it really lunch?????\""}
{"text":"So, I just started working in old town Scottsdale, and one of my team members recommended that we have a team lunch somewhere close by in Scottsdale.  Furthermore, she recommended that we go to Lolo's Chicken and Waffles, to which I replied, Hellz yes.  Never been there, but it sounded disgustingly great.

My instincts were correct.  Before I knew it, we were all staring at plates with heavily breaded, fried chicken breasts, thin, crispy waffles and nice sides of GRAVY and mac and cheese.

Sweet Jesus - this stuff was AMAZING.  The fried chicken was some of the best I've had, and the waffles, well, they were the BEST waffles I've ever had, done and done.  I ate the fried chicken and mac and cheese first, and then the waffle for dessert.  Epic, simply epic.

The only thing I didn't have that I wish I did, was a mason jar full of red Koolaid.  It would have been perfect.  I did have iced tea, which was awesome anyway.

The only drawback to lunch at Lolo's is that I'm now back at the office and experiencing a food coma that at best will negatively impact my productivity, and at worst will snatch the life out of my grease soaked carcass.

Five stars - can't wait to go there after a night of boozing."}
{"text":"Everything that's not good for you,  but it's soooo good.   The salads aren't good here.   If you go there to eat,  ALL of their fried food items are scrumptious, worthy of one good cheat meal.  Trust me, it'll make you get a room of you're from out of town.  It's that good"}
{"text":"Maybe I am missing something, maybe it was all the hype that I hear, but I thought the food was just...ok. I definitely did not have the same religious experience that some people have while eating here, and I guess I just didn't see what all the fuss was about. Customer service was fantastic, our server was great, and everyone there was extremely nice and accommodating on a busy Sunday brunch time. I ordered the waffle with chicken breast and wing, and it came out in about five minutes after we ordered, which seemed great. The food was good, but not impressive. It seemed like it had probably been made en masse and was sitting under a heat lamp for a while. The waffle was not crispy, but was warm and kind of flaccid, and the chicken was piping hot, but very dry. I did love the hot sauce, and I dipped all of the chicken in it to help with the dryness. Also had the red velvet cake, which was the most amazing part of the meal, and I believe touched by the hands of angels during baking. While I realize that it was probably because we came at the  busiest time of the week, all in all, I have had better chicken from KFC, and a better waffle from Waffle House, just not on the same plate."}
{"text":"We brought a friend from Atlanta to enjoy some \"real southern home cookin'\" . He loved it! For his dinner he chose the biscuits and gravy and sweet tea, of course. Huge portions, thick chunky delicious, a bit spicy, gravy on large homemade biscuits. He was not disappointed with the perfect service, attentive staff (Shawanda), and awesome food. I got the smothered chicken tenders that had a little bit of spice to the gravy, fried okra (always done to perfection), and whipped potatoes (mashed potatoes with gravy whipped in). Hubby enjoyed 3 perfectly pieces of fried chicken, okra and outstanding cheesy grits! 
Tip: The tea is best if you get 1/2 & 1/2 since the sweet is really sweet.
The wait for us on a Saturday night, 5:30 pm was exactly 20 minutes, which is what they estimated at time of check in. The handy texting when table is ready makes it worry free that you won't be missing your name being called and keeps our anonymity.   
This is always a favorite stop after going to the top of South Mountain after a sunset. 
Restrooms are roomy and clean. Decor is simple and clean. 
Expect to be yelling at each other the whole time you're there due to the loud music. 
Pay at the table with the server, which is always a nice customer service thing. 
I'd recommend LoLo's Chicken & Waffles to anyone who want an honestly good meal!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday with my wife, son, and father. First of all I will say that the service was amazing. Everyone was very friendly and was attentive to our needs. The chicken was juicy and golden brown, I was expecting a little more seasoning, but none the less was amazing. I got the soul food platter with mac n cheese and greens. I usually hate greens from restaurants, but these greens were perfect!  My wife got the 3 piece chicken and waffles with a side of cheese grits. All the food was great. Just moved to the area in July 2015 and this is my new number one spot!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dining at Lo-Lo's. The menu offered some unique items like the fried green beans (very tasty) and fried green tomatoes. The waffles were not the Belgian style and tended to be a little dry. The fried chicken was served hot but lacked any distinguishable seasoning. The salmon croquettes were good flavor however they were a little light on the salmon and heavy on breading. 

I would eat there again, but would try different menu items and another order of fries green beans. Generous sized drinks (served in a large mason jar) help you wash down your meal!  Prices are reasonable and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Everything looked and smelled great. Unfortunately, everyone around me got served (even those that were seated later). After leaving (lunch break was up), the manager on the phone said it was because I ordered chicken breast. Note to self, order what they have available, not what you really want to try. The manager DID apologize, but only after I asked him to acknowledge that they were wrong. Although I'm not a dentist, I feel like one having to pull teeth to get some courtesy out of Lo-Lo's Chicken (thighs) and Waffles."}
{"text":"Overpriced.
But Dat Red Velvet cake is the tits!
also, they have old school cartoons playing."}
{"text":"So was excited at fact that this place had all day breakfast and I had not been.  Well that's where the excitement ends...

It's next to Holiday Inn Express.. The hotel has cock blocked all the parking spots so they have a \"complimentary valet\"...um yeah that's $5 before you even walk in door, cause of course you have to tip.  Valet for Lolo's? 

Ok it's 100 degrees outside and upper 90s in this place. Um I get the southern motif but hells balls who wants to sweat while eating? It was like eating while in a sauna.  I swore I saw a fat dude in just a towel...

I order the chorizo and eggs with potatoes and asked for cheese on top (extra charge...that's weak sauce). I was there at 3:00, place was half filled yet it took easily 25 minutes.  For eggs? Well hell, I know why it took 25 minutes after I saw what they plopped down in front of me (sans cheese) 

\"The Chow\"-Yeah eggs were as dry as hell. 

Who knows how the chicken and waffles are, I won't be back. I'd advise not to order breakfast there. 

Out."}
{"text":"A friend of mine kept talking about Lo-Lo's and how great it is.  Today, we went.  Wow, I have to agree.  We were greeted right away at the door.  Our waitress came over, introduced herself, and took us to our table.  Immediately, she asked what we wanted to drink, and brought out our drinks in less than a minute.  I had the vegetable plate.  The Fried Okra was good, but not as good as my wife makes.  The beans and rice were \"OK\".  I also had corn - delicious, and green beans - delicious, and a sweet cornbread (also delicious).  I can't wait to go back and try some more vegetables!"}
{"text":"Music is good :) Food was great!!! Wish came in with a totally empty stomach"}
{"text":"Without a doubt the BEST Biscuits and Gravy I have ever had!! Service was great, food came out relatively fast considering they were on a 30 minute wait and packed to the brim, and the rest of our food was absolutely delicious! I can't wait to go back! I wish the chairs were more comfortable...next time, I'll request a booth :)"}
{"text":"Went here for a paint night. We we're sat outside with a menu to wait till the class started... We waited about 20 mins before someone came to see if we needed a drink or anything. In the meantime my husband had gone in to who we we're told was our waitress, then to the hostess and then to another waiter begging for a damp cloth to wash the table we we're sat at. Look we WERE outside and and I know dust and dirt fly and will settle but the table was FILTHY! There was marks from previous cups, and food. FINALY someone came out and did a half a**Ed job of wiping, I had to ask him back as he hurried away so fast cause he missed my spot completely. The photos are AFTER he wiped the table and I AND MY HUSBAND HAD TO USE OUR NAPKINS to still wipe...and the food and dirt I scrubbed off. Needless to say we stuck to drinks as I was too worried to eat at our table"}
{"text":"I didn't care for the waffles. Felt like they were a little dry, but I did order it Take Out, so maybe the box had something to do with it. The chicken was actually really good though. I'm not an egg person, but the scrambled eggs were amazing."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Lo-Lo's... Best vegetarian option has to be The CJ's (number 14 I believe - 1 waffle, 1 egg, and a small bowl of grits). And when I'm being a \"bad vegetarian\" I can get a southern style chicken leg as a side order. Seriously amazing grits & the southern style chicken with the waffle just can't be beat (especially if you \"accidentally\" get a little syrup on the perfectly seasoned chicken)."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. My family and I went there on a Sunday and were promptly seated. That's where the service ended. We waited forever for a server to come take our order and then proceeded to watch as every other table in the place got food while we got nothing. Eventually the manager walked by and we grabbed him and told him what was going on and he said \"How could this happen?\" Yeah-that's what I wanted to know too... it took them so long that we almost missed the symphony and had to get our food to go - and then they didn't even include everything we ordered! And they didn't even try to make it better by comping us anything or even apologizing... I don't know if the food is good when it comes out fresh, since we didn't get to eat it there, but it's not all that good reheated... we won't be going again..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Chicken and waffles, drank, kool-aid, mac and cheese, with all the sugar, grease, butter and fat, these will lead you to an early death for sure, but you don't really worry about that at Lo-Lo's.  You just stuff your face full of disgustingly good food and don't think about the years that are coming off your life.  I won't be thinking about a heart attack, stomach cancer or diabetes next time I eat here.  I'll be thinking about what to order next - a Phat Azz Samich and some Stupid Fries, thank you."}
{"text":"I've ate at both locations, the food is usually good, some times they are bit off and the chicken seems tough. Red Velvet cake is great, sweet tea is just like down south, and the waffles are delicious!

Both locations are always crowded so get there early and come hungry!"}
{"text":"The chicken was very dry. For some reason this place has lost its touch. This is the third time I have went and had dry chicken, so unfortunate."}
{"text":"I live in Atlanta and never thought to get chicken & waffles outside of the south! Having been in PHX several times now, I was ready to try something new - and what's better than some c&w for lunch?!

West of the airport, Lolo's is in a cool renovated brick building - to me it felt more like a lunch than dinner spot, also because of the location. 
The atmosphere definitely fits the concept (modern-rustic kinda made me want a beer type ...) and was comfortable to hang out in! The service was spot on and our server was fun.

Their menu is definitely heavy (I hope they never have to list calories!) but you know that going in. The menu has a large variety, all day breakfast, burgers, of course chicken/waffles and southern staples such as fried tomatoes, etc ... they have a platter option which I felt was a great way to get a flight across their menu. I had fried chicken and waffles with a side of mac'n'cheese - post nap optional.
Everything was hands down delicious and everyone on our table really enjoyed their meal! Everything was well seasoned, the chicken was crispy and the waffles well made! 

Someone else recommended to eat chicken and waffles in the same bite ... ditto that and make sure to dip it in maple sirup!
I'd recommend this place any day, it's different than you average lunch place and a fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I do not see what all the hype is about...2 times and still not impressed, or satisfied.  I am all about these types of foods on occasion but the waffle was horrible and cheap, the chicken was dry and tasteless and my lunch was $14...I have tried multiple menu items and have found all of them to be sub par products and over priced.  Staff is friendly and the location is good but...."}
{"text":"Insanely good chicken. Salty but not too salty. Crisp but not too crisp. Juicy (there is no such thing as too juicy). The proprietor and staff are always so nice and the food comes quick. Absolutely no complaints, and I have been here A) A few times (what I'd tell my doctor or other half) B) Like every week for the past two years. Old reliable. And good for you, too!"}
{"text":"Always good! Always clean! Best service from Jamal as usual! We drive up from Tucson just to come eat here! Wish we had one in Tucson. Stupid fries, waffles, chicken, corn bread, and Mac and cheese today, perfect!"}
{"text":"I am sure to visit Lo Lo's every time I am in Phoenix. The waffles are perfect, fried chicken is delicious, and the service is great (especially Mimi)!"}
{"text":"I am giving this rating 2 stars because the service that I had was extremely rememberable in a dis-tasting way. I ordered their steak and eggs, and I ordered rare for my steak but the steak I received was slightly charred on the outside and the inside was super rare! Like it was placed on the grill for 15 seconds! Steak was cold, inside of the steak was still icy. I don't recommend the steak here.. Keep it to the chicken and waffles. Not to mention the service I had. She was rude, she asked my opinion about the steak and I told her the exact words and all she had to say was \"okay......\" And left the table. If you want my opinion lady, hear it out and let your cooks know.. Because it is their job to cook properly, and that is how you will make more tip just by a slight change in attitude."}
{"text":"Disappointing customer service. I will always go to the Scottsdale location going forward. 

There was a miscommunication with the host regarding whether our group wanted to be together or separate. We were quoted an hour wait and after an hour and fifteen minutes we asked the hostess for an update. We realized they had grouped us together so we requested to ungroup us and seat us separately as it would be easier for the restaurant. 

We waited another 20 minutes and continued to watch other groups being seated. I approached the hostess again to find out the status of our table. The staff had completely ignored our request to not be seated as a group for a second time. This time she said they would have our group of 6 seated as soon as a table became available. 

I watched the staff hold off on seating guests as tables contiued to be cleaned off in an attempt to remedy the situation. We waited another 20 minutes to find out they were still trying to seat us as a group. What has happened to listening to the customer? I will be going to Old Town from now on."}
{"text":"This Place right here!!!! Will give you an awesome experience with Southern food! The food I grew up eating in grandmas and moms kitchen, from the Grits and shrimp to the chicken waffles down to the sweet butter cornbread. This place is a must I took pictures I will up load them later! Thank you Lo Lo for letting me experience such Greatness!"}
{"text":"OVERRATED fo' sho'. The food ain't great and the waiting time is ridiculous. Our order came out cold but we ate it anyway cause we was HONGRY. How you gonna serve cold ass chicken and limp fries? AND charge high prices? The music was bump in' but I could'a stayed home for that. Talked to another family member and they too have sworn off this place. Too bad cause when they first opened, it was pretty good but I guess they got too big for they britches. Bye Felicia, we will never spend our time or money on this place again."}
{"text":"Seriously,

If this type of food wasn't bad for you, I would give 50 star. Lo-Lo's chicken and waffles is just awesome and tasty. Service is always quick and easy. There's nothing bad I can say about it, except the fact that I limit myself to only have Lo-Lo's once every 3 or 4 months. LOVE!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! I arrived in Arizona after a 5 hour flight from Washington, DC and my family took me to Lo-Lo's.  The food was excellent and the Kool-aid ON POINT!!! Our waitress had a great personality and the atmosphere in the restaurant was just great.  I definitely want to go here again before I leave to head back east!!! #MOSTGO"}
{"text":"I came here with an open mind.  I typically stick to breakfast or dinner so the idea of chicken and waffles was not appealing to me.  That being said, I am adventurous with food so I thought I would give it a try.  I was not impressed.  I would say the first \"foul\" was that the waitress accidentally tipped the coffee pot she was holding and spilled hot coffee all over my shoulder and dress.  I was not event offered a free cup of coffee!  This burned my skin and stained my dress.  Well,  I let this go.  The food was ok; nothing special and not what I had expected.  The chicken was dry and the waffles were bland.  Also, I only like real maple syrup so the sticky, pure sugar was extremely gross.  We had a group of 7 and the waitress REFUSED to split our check 7 ways.  She kept throwing out 18% gratuity which only told us that she cared more about being able to charge us more than giving us what we needed as customers.  Overall, the customer service was really awful and will keep me from ever returning here!"}
{"text":"WOW! Can I just say, WOW!? This is some soul food for real! I came out with a (SUPER) happy belly and some serious food coma after!

Eats.
+ Chicken and Waffles. FTW! FTW. I've had some Roscoe's before, but it doesn't compare to Lo-Lo's! The chicken here has extra crispy skin and the chicken pieces were perfectly juicy. The waffle is the perfect portion size (I only got 1 and I couldn't even finish it).
+ Fried Green Tomatoes. Mmmmmm Mmmmm Mmmmmmm! 4 pieces in a basket, that's perfect for sharing but you might not want to share after you taste how good they are!
+ Biscuits and gravy. Ugh. Can we stop here?! Seriously.. this was. so. good! Fresh fluffy biscuits smothered in gravy. This was delicious, but I was really hoping for a deeper brown kind of gravy - this one was more white. Nevertheless it was still GOOD!

Drinks.
+ They come in the largest sized mason jars - love, love, love it!

I love their menu options. They have mixed up almost every combo you can think of. Now mind you, they're a chicken and waffles place so if you order something other than, it may take a while to get your food. Just saying.. Also, they serve breakfast all day (winner, winner chicken dinner)!

If you're in the neighborhood and want some soul food, this is it! The portions are huge so don't be surprised if you end up bringing home some leftovers."}
{"text":"My wife and I loved it.  We went for breakfast during the week so it was not crowded at all and the customer service was almost personalized.  We wanted to sample the signature dish and another entree so we split her Tre-Tre and my chorizo and eggs (which was the way to go for us).  As with most restaurants these days drinks have gone from being \"cheap eats\" to \"muy expensive\".  This spot is no different as a healthy glass of OJ and an endless cup of coffee were almost 1/3 of the total bill.   Next time will do the Kool-Aid \"on tap!\" so at least I will be happy spending the money.

After digging on the music and noticing the full bar & drink menu we wished we had stopped in the night before.  We also noticed the menu listed a location in the DFW Area (hey peeps...need to advertise!!!) and the Phoenix Airport so we made plans to hit it again that afternoon before we flew out (bad decision as the airport location is NOT the same)."}
{"text":"If you're reading the other great reviews for Lo-Lo's and hope to catch a taste in the airport...please don't let this small kiosk style location taint your experience.  This smaller Lo-Lo's is definitely NOT on the same level as the location we visited in Scottsdale.  The food is prepared well but the menu is limited.  For example breakfast and desserts were showing on the menu board but are no longer available (...and my wife was tuned up for her some red velvet cake too!).  The biggest issue though is the time it takes...+15mins...for many entrees.  In fairness they do tell you up front and because of the longer time it takes you know it was freshly prepared.  

We will continue to sing Lo-Lo's praises to others and hope to visit the  DFW spot in the very near future but we seriously doubt we will do this smaller joint again."}
{"text":"The food here is really good, as always, just like any other location. However, the service that I experienced at this location was horrible. 

Planned to celebrate my birthday here with a large party last Sunday. My wife called them a couple of times during the week leading up to the day of our planned visit. From talking to two different people, she was informed that they would be able to accommodate our party with no issues. We planned on having 40 guests and she was told that they've entertained as many as 60 guests before. They know that we are coming with 40. They know we're coming on a Sunday, for lunch. They don't do reservations but \"as long as we get there about an hour early, it'll be fine.\" So far, so good. 

Day of, my wife and I get there 45 minutes early (not quite an hour, I know.) We told the hostess our situation and wanted to put our name down for the wait, and they were floored by the amount of people. They began to explain how difficult it would be to accommodate so many people, being that it's their busiest day and at the busiest time. So after waiting for about half and hour, listening to the give us inconsistent information and watching them scramble to make something work for us, we just decide to move the party elsewhere. Before we left, the manager Marcus told us that if we (my wife and I) came back during the week he would \"give us a free meal\". They messed up, but they're trying to make it right. Cool. 

Last night, we came back for our \"free\" meal. We told the waitress before ordering what Marcus promised us. We didn't hear from Marcus until our bill arrived. Our waitress initially came out saying we can get 30% off. We said that wasn't what we were promised. So then Marcus came out and said that we misunderstood him. He said he would give me, the birthday celebrant, a free meal. So he gave me the option of either getting my entree for free or 30% off the entire bill. Then when we ran the card it ended up being just about 50% after all. Not that we're not appreciative, but it didn't seem like they were going by any kind of policy and was just winging it. With only $15 to pay, he apologized that he couldn't comp the entire thing but somehow was able to offer a free dessert. That kind of confused us. Why have us go through all of this if you can do that? Why not just cover the meal entirely? 

Basically, they messed up. We gave them a second chance and they somehow made the experience worse. Personally, I can't stand it when people don't stick to their word. For that, they get 1 star."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great find. Great food, great service, great atmosphere.  A perfect combination. Of course you have to try the chicken and waffles but don't forget about the shrimp and grits. Excellent! The location is very convenient off of Scottsdale Rd. This a \"must stop\" place for great food and perfect drinks. This is a fun first date place."}
{"text":"I just got back from getting some \"to go\" food from LoLo's Scottsdale location. Gabe was slinging drinks @ the bar & Ian was the MOD. I ordered 2 of the \"Soul food platters\" dinners, 1 was all dark meat w/2 sides (double rice & beans) & the other was chicken strips w/2 sides of smothered potatoes. The food was absolutely SPECTACULAR! Thanks to Gabe & Ian for a GREAT to go food experience!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and my very first venture into the culinary world of chicken and waffles. I do have to say I still haven't wrapped my palette or maybe my mind around the concept. One is a breakfast item primarily and the other a dinner main attraction. This lead me to start thinking..... Which came first the chicken or the egg? Well I'm thinkin the egg because the egg and waffle as a morning meal complement each other so much better then the chicken and waffle for dinner. The whole meal l kept thinking damn that Mac n cheese and cornbread at the next table look delish!!
Ok so.... The review.... My friends started with fried okra it looked good but I'm not a fan in general. They neither complained or raved..... Shoulda asked.  The chicken was fried to a golden brown, moist, tender and very flavorful. I had the breast and could have eaten another. It wasn't large just average in size. ;-) The waffle was big but flat no rise to it (I am partial to the Belgian variety) flavor was good but just a waffle. I did try the various eating techniques, hot sauce on chicken with the waffle and syrup in one bit, then without the hot sauce next was one bite then the other, tried reverse order but nothing wowed me as a combo.... Still my eyes, mouth and stomach wandered to the table next to me... Cornbread Mac n cheese oh how I desire you.  
The service very good friendly and attentive. The cakes looked amazing. But already had the sweet craving satisfied with the waffle. If you are a kool aid fan this is your place. However I saw no stained upper lips..... Very unusual  :-/
I will be back for the more traditional southern fried chicken dinner. Mmm, Mmm, Mmm!!!"}
{"text":"I be drankin' the Kool-Aid.   The Kool-Aid on TAP comes in giant mason jars; this ain't no hipster spot that uses the cutesy, regular mason jars - these are supersized servings of diabetes.  And if that's not enough, they'll gladly give you a to-go cup, so you can take your unfinished diabetes home for later.  Ghetto fab!

- $12 Lo-Lo's - Three pieces of fried chicken and two waffles.  The seasoned breading made the chicken amazingly tasty - this ain't no ordinary fry chick'n.  Of note, the drumstick was gigantic compared to the breast - they really do grow 'em bigger in the south.  (I guess that makes me a leg man instead of a breast man?)   The waffles were crispy, and there was a tolerable hint of cinnamon (YUCK for me).

- $11 Stupid Fries - Fat fries with gravy & cheese, diced peppers & onions, chicken, and cayenne seasoning.  The chicken was fried and seasoned - it's not just boring chunks of meat.  So good you'll want to slap yo mama.

The one thing that wasn't hood was the service - everyone was very friendly without the ghetto fabulous *SNAP-SNAP-SNAP* attitude, although the kitchen was slightly slow.  And who doesn't love a place where the everyone is sportin' shirts that say \"HOOD RICH!!!\"

Now, excuse me now while I put my other foot in the grave after the combo plate of diabetes and heart attack, yo."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times for lunch.  Always packed.  Parking kinda sucks but the food is worth it.  The chicken is juicy and flavorful.  Definitely get the chicken and waffle plate.  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, the DJ they had was really good he had all kinds of music.  This was my first time coming to Lolo's and I will be back.  Also will recommend to family and friendd."}
{"text":"The food here is decent. Been a couple times with some friends, and its a good fall back place, but it wouldn't be my first pick. Mostly because for what you get, its a bit expensive. If the food were exceptional I wouldn't mind, but its not. Its just...decent..."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good, i dont think i could find a flaw in its food quality if i tired. The waffles are crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. The fried chicken was perfect with crispy skin and no uncooked fatty parts as i normally see with other places and it also had a delicious seasoning, the meat was also good being tender and juicy. They get creative points with kool aid too and this aint no bitch kool aid we mad as kids this is great kool-aid that somehow keeps it flavor even with melting ice in it. i cant wait to go back its great kinda like hot sex on a plate."}
{"text":"crisp fried chicken, excellent waffles and my favorite , the greens. This is basic \"soul\" food. They have recently added a few more salads to the menu which means I can go there and not have to gain weight!!!!"}
{"text":"Please everyone, if you are in Phoenix, AZ you must eat the fried chicken here. Holy smokes is the skin crispy and flavorful! Doesn't feel heavy at all...I should have ordered some to go :/"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere lovevthe food, portion was great and very crowded,  little too small for the amount of people and the wait is crazy but so worth it, recommended to anyone that want a piece of history."}
{"text":"YUM! This place is good. Fried pickles, Rotisserie Chicken, cole slaw!
I did not try the fried chicken and waffles but saw many having it and smiling so it must have been good. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was very good but WOW this place is LOUD when it is busy.  Concrete walls reflect all of the sound and gave me a headache.  Never had this happen at a restaurant before."}
{"text":"Unique dining for sure. NOT a fancy place, not a date place. But awesome options.... First of all, where else can you order kool-aid????

Also, The mac and cheese side is amazing. I ordered the Betty Boop- a chicken breast and waffle, and added to it a side of the mac and cheese. Everything tastes exactly how i dreamnt it would. Fattening and hearty!

Take home a slice of the red velvet cake.... the best I have ever had anywhere hands down."}
{"text":"Sadly the fried chicken has seriously declined. Two thighs and a breast were all dried out and overcooked. The problem was not that it had sat around too long - it was just cooked too long - and that's a crime. Waffle was excellent, service meh. It'll be a while before I give them another try."}
{"text":"The Chicken and Waffles really hit the spot.  A great place to go to with generous portions and plenty of coffee.  The service was pretty good too."}
{"text":"I invited my son's club basketball team to have dinner at Lolo's Chicken Waffles located in Phoenix on Saturday June 13th after our games. I had 20 people who RSVP'd to me that they would be coming so I called Lolo's Friday around 4:30 to make reservations because I know how busy that location gets on the weekend. I have made reservations at this location several times before and was told that there would be a $1.00 reservation per person but this time I was told that it would be $5.00 per person. I told the guy that took my reservation that it would not be a problem so he asked me for my credit card to make reservations for 20 people. I called back the next day (Saturday) at 1:50 because I had 7 more people that I had to add to our reservation and they said that would not be a problem they would just have to charge $5.00 per person to add them and I said that was fine because I knew even if we did not get that money refunded we would be spending at least that much. We had a great dinner and our waitress separated our bills like we asked when we had placed our orders. She came out gave everyone their bill and two people paid right away because they had to leave. When everyone else was ready to pay the waitress never came back so I had to go and find out what was going on. This is when I am finally being told that they had already charged my card for the entire party $541.00. I then told the Manager that we had asked for separate bills before we ordered. Then he says that I was charged $25.00 per person because I had made reservations. Well first if all if that was true the amount would not be $541.00 it would have been $500.00 for 20 people because they charged my card Friday the day before I even added the extra 7 people so that is a lie. Then I am being told that because I reserved the party room I was being charged some type of catering party package and they start showing me this contract that I have never seen before. I then tell Chris and the Manager that I did not ask to be put in a party room and if they chose to seat our large party there then that was their choice. I have made reservations there before for our company with large groups and it had never been an issue before. I then ask the waitress what the total bill was for our entire party and she says it was $440.00 so they are overcharging us $101.00! Then they tried to say it was because they charge $25.00 per person and I then told them if it would make sense for someone to make reservations for $25.00 per person when the most expensive item on the menu is $15.00, ridiculous! The manager then had to call the owner twice to explain the situation because they were not going to refund our money. After 40 minutes of him going back and forth on phone with the owner he finally got the approval to give us the refund. First I had to pay our tab which was over $200.00 and then because there were two families that had paid and left I had to pay their tabs too because they had issued a refund back to their cards because they actually thought that we were going to just pay the $541.00 like we were idiots! So I ended up paying $140.00 for those tabs as well. Then the manager goes to do our refund and he does not have the authorization to complete a refund for that amount, UNBELIEVABLE! So then we are told that we would get a call back on Sunday to get it taken care of and nobody calls us back so I have to end up calling them. I talked to Chris on the phone and he then tells me that the owners are on vacation and they will not be able to issue the refund until they come back to town. What kind of owners does not empower their managers to make decisions and issue refunds, but also what type of customer service is that! I ended up having over $800.00 taken out of our account just for dinner!! The account that was used belongs to our club team account that is a non-profit, so now our team is out $541.00 that is raised by the players with sponsorships and donations to use to pay for gym fees and tournaments and now we do not have those funds to use. That is not all, I then call another location and I am told that the owners are not on vacation and the only way to communicate with them is to go online and submit a request, even after we had given specific instructions to the managers Saturday night that we wanted a phone call from the owners. I sent this exact letter to the owners on their website like I was told and to this day I still have not received one response from anyone at Lolo's. I had to dispute the charges with my bank finally because our team needs the money to pay for our gym this week and a tournament. Don't ever trust Lolo's with your credit card because they will lie to you."}
{"text":"I can honestly say I will be back. I have been wanting to try this place for quite some time tho, I am from out of town, I travel for work and always stay at the hotel across the street I finally tried lolos and let me tell you, it was fantastic made me think of home. My waitress a young lady, kyla, was fantastic very patient  gave me the time in the world and didn't get mad when it took me a long time to look over the huge menu, didn't kick me out the door even tho I know I was there past close she didn't act like they we're closed at all still visit my table joking around very nice and very sweet she even offered me another wine. The place was very busy and I could see her running around yet still managing to check on her tables even if it was a quick stop by with a smile, very professional. Now to the food it was fantastic I had the soul food platter and it was amazing I was so stuffed by the end of my meal. The catfish was cooked just right as the chicken was very juicy and not dry what so ever. I was pleauntly surprised when the cornbread was actually sweet cornbread with pieces of corn in it! I could eat the cornbread for days.  The portions we're very hefty and you get bang for your buck. I was very tempted to come back this morning if I didn't fly out then found out you we're also in the airport! Lastly at the end of the meal I ended up crying because I felt like I was back home and felt very welcomed and will be returning and asking for kyla and maybe try something new,tho I think I'm addicted to the soul food platter, but thank you for giving me a slice of home."}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles were good but a little over priced.  20$ per person with drink ( ice tea).   The service is just ok. It's kind of hit and miss one table gets in and out quickly while others wait. Not sure why.  We had the same food?  Servers could use some training.  After having mediocre service it is really bold of them to print a 20% tip at the bottom of the  check.  I normally do tip 20% or above for good service and a little less for poor service. That just left me feeling a little bitter."}
{"text":"First,  want to say our server was attentive and courteous. However I had a problem with over an hour wait to sit down (we were told 30 min wait) & then almost another hour to get our food. Keep in mind we noticed several just walking around not attending to anyone. Please step up your customer service or you will not have returning customers"}
{"text":"Food was great and our waiter was amazing! Very friendly and and courteous! 

Now let's talk about the parking.... HORRIBLE. I literally drove around 15min to find a fricken parking stop! There are \"no parking\" signs everywhere due to the hotel that's right next door which makes it so inconvenient. I did see there was valet but really? Why does this place have valet? It makes it so much more frustrating to move around the long lines of cars that are waiting for valet. Maybe if the valet guys weren't standing around chatting there wouldn't be so many cars piling up! Anyways parked at the Bank of America across the street since they were closed today, otherwise who knows where I would've  parked."}
{"text":"Fired chicken was crispy and delicious! Mac and cheese was good and creamy! Waffles were cooked to a perfect golden Brown! Plus you gotta love a restaurant with kool-aid, it takes me back"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of time. The first time was the best, but my recent experience was not so great. The server was great, but the food was just ok. I had a party of 5 and everyone order the special there. We even had the sampler trio. That's where it went bad. We had the catfish, deep fried green tomato and chicken gizzards. The gizzards seemed to be over cooked and way too soft. the catfish was too fishy and we did not even want to finish it. I have had better chicken at other places. There was nothing special to the chicken."}
{"text":"Parking is a nightmare.  The wait time for your food to hit your table is ridiculous.  The servers are unapologetic and it's very frustrating.  The waffles are nothing special but the chicken is really good."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING!  Usually you can get good food or good service, but it's very rare to get both.  Lo-Lo's delivers on both.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the parking is tight and the area of town is iffy.  But it's totally worth it.  I mean, do you know anyplace else that has Kool Aid on the menu?  Their menu looks amazing -- I haven't seen chicken gizzards on a menu since I left home, and though I haven't tried them yet, they're on my list for the next visit!  And their fried chicken is AMAZING!  It may even be better than my mom's (and I can say that honestly because she's not on Yelp yet).  It seems like fried chicken and mac n cheese would be easy to do well, but as anyone who's been to KFC can tell you, that's not the case.  LoLo's has great food and the staff was super attentive, even though they were busy.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"would have to say im at lo-los at least once a month on sunday morning right after church...you have to get there by at least 945 or you gonna be waiting in a long line...but even ifc you do wait its worth it...they have the best  chicken in town and the waffles are to die for...there okra takes me back to how momma use to make it...i would recommend gettin the chicken smothered in gravy...soooooo good...

thank you for the awesome food lolos"}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's has some of the best food you can find in Phoenix, and they honestly make the best Southern food I've ever had.  Their fried chicken is absolutely fantastic - it's just so moist and flavorful.  Their Mac 'N Cheese is also excellent.  Honestly, everything here is just really good - the only thing that disappointed me was that the cheese grits weren't quite as cheesy as I had expected them to be.  Still though, they were delicious.  If you're looking for good Southern food, this is absolutely the right place to go."}
{"text":"Lolo's is fine.  I've been a few times with friends.  The menu is unique and the portions are good.  A+ on selection.  The food is okay.  College kids love this place!"}
{"text":"Found out about this place while researching for my trip to Phoenix.   Sounded good to me so I had to try it out.   The hostess was with someone else when I came in, but she acknowledged me and said she'd be right with me.  I was seated with no wait.   Once I placed my order, it was on my table fresh & hot in no time at all.  I had one of the good classic meals.  2 drumsticks and a waffle.  The presentation was meh,  but the taste made up for it.  The chicken was hot and thoroughly cooked.  The waffle was great, although a little more syrup would've been nice.  I decided to have a cocktail, and the signature drink,  lo lo's punch did not disappoint.  The staff were all attentive and professional.  It's a nice local place to check out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I have only had Lo-Lo's once before and I loved it then! So today, my mom and sister in law mentioned how they had never been here before so we chose this for lunch and I am so happy we did! We had Mike as our server and he is awesome! Wonderful customer service skills and just so friendly!! As a manager at a restaurant it was nice to have the manager stop by and interact with us and other guests! The food was incredible(even though I ordered WAY too much)! We will definitely be back! If you're ever in, hopefully you get Mike as a server!"}
{"text":"First time here and OMG deffinately not my last. The service was great. The food even better. Don't cheat yourself,treat yourself!"}
{"text":"Came out to Arizona for my birthday and it was a very nice trip. A high school buddy told me about this spot and so, we had to try it.

Long story short, the chicken wasnt seasoned enough, the kool aid was extra sweet. It tasted like straight concentrate with ice. The waffles were ok. 

The waitress was not friendly and hardly ever came by to ask if we were good. We had to look for her most of the times

I only give it 2 stars because of the decor"}
{"text":"For those saying the fried chicken wasn't the best they've ever had, please make sure to tell us where you found better because I don't believe such a place exists!  

I had Tre Tre's, which is two legs and a waffle.  I am in love with those huge drumsticks!  So juicy and the skin so crispy...ahhh.  Perfection!  

The waffle was fantastic but to me, the chicken was the star of the show.  

I also ordered a side of beans over rice and it was good, not great.  I put some hot sauce and pepper on top and that made it very good.  

My fiance got the Soulfood Platter and ordered cheese grits on the side.  I may not know much about grits but I know that the creamy, buttery, cheesy bite that I had was pretty close to heaven on earth. 

Excuse me now...I must find something to mop up the drool on my keyboard."}
{"text":"Server Mike has a lot of good energy. He was groovy!! I will say that all the meat here is all fried. We requested for a grilled chicken breast and the chef honored our request so that was great!

I ordered: (a lot of food) 

Kool-Aid: Tropical Punch & Lemonade. It's good next time I will say light ice because it gets watery.

#7 Toy-Toy- was good

MacNcheese = the bomb!!!! I love it

Smothered Rice & smothered Potatoes were delicious!
Grilled Breast was seasoned to perfection.
Catfish seasoned  perfect.
Collard Greens  they were ok.
Potato Salad was ok needs a little sweet relish or sugar."}
{"text":"two perfectly breaded and fried drumsticks, a vanilla waffle covered in maple syrup, the creamiest mac and cheese ever, fried okra, and a huge hunk of corn bread. yes, my extremely large ass ate all of that and i don't regret it for a second. 

this place is fantastic! the menu is full of all the favorites that my grandmother used to make me as a kid such as red beans, rice and gravy, cheese grits, fried okra, and any part of the chicken you want fried. you really can't go wrong. this place has something for everyone unless you're on some type of ungodly diet that doesn't allow you to have an epic cheat day.

this location is decently sized but can fill up in a heartbeat. be prepared to wait about 30 - 45 minutes for a table. it might be a little long but its totally worth it. i also recommend trying out the many flavors of kool aid or the lemonade. delicious. 

for me, lolo's is a once a year type of thing because honestly, i couldn't imagine eating this on the regular and still fitting into pants that dont have an elastic waist band."}
{"text":"Lo Lo's Chicken and Waffles is a great place for comfort food with soul in downtown Scottsdale.  Good food at great prices!  It's a great atmosphere for singles or large families and they play GREAT music to top it all off. Classic R&B hits definitely made my experience more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Ate here for the 1st time like the food just the service wasn't that great. We waited for an 1hour to receive food.  
Once it arrives we inhaled it. Food is good just don't go hungry."}
{"text":"I love Lo Lo's but I love it for reasons other than the chicken.   I love their chicken, don't get me wrong, but I go for the cornbread and the veggies.  I'm from the South, and the combination of chicken and waffles isn't as odd as it might seem to people from other parts of the country.  This is a southern staple, and suprisingly good.  However, it's the collards, fried okra and candied sweets with cornbread that get my attention.  It's hard to find any place here in the Valley that serves collard greens -- or greens of any kind -- much less collard greens done really well.  Add a little tabasco vinegar, and you're ready to rock.  Couple the veggies with a huge hunk of cornbread slathered in butter, and your meal is complete.  

I've also enjoyed their fish and chips.  Catfish is my favorite, but the other fish is also very good.  I'd really love it if they added fried chicken livers to the menu, but in the meantime, I happily order the chicken, which is southern style and delicious.  

The wait can be daunting on weekends, so be prepared to wait if you get there for breakfast or lunch.  The place is less crowded in the evening.  When it's slammed, it can be a while before you get served, but the staff is friendly, and helpful."}
{"text":"Since my last review, I've revisited this restaurant at their new location and the food is still great, plus they now have sufficient staff to handle a brisk business.  I recently had the fried catfish, with collard greens and candied sweets.  Being from the Texas, those collards were a welcome little bit of \"south in my mouth.\"  The catfish was cooked to perfection and the wait was reasonable.  The wait staff is friendly and welcoming.  New location, new, more positive experience.

Update:  This new location rocks!  We tried the take away this time, and it was the same great food, and it came to us hot, fresh and ready to enjoy.  The counter staff were quick, attentive and got our order ahead of schedule."}
{"text":"I am always impressed when I come to the downtown location the original location where it all started for Lo-Lo's the staff is excellent servers are always on point very attentive to what your needs are ahead of time the food is just generally good you can't be that it is awesome love coming here going to start coming down on Wednesday for comedy night which is great addition to the valley giving you food and entertainment what other places in the valley are giving you that all at the same time and generally concern and grateful for their patronage of their customers continue to come and support this establishment.

So the very first time that I came out here 5 years ago and visit his place up until now but downtown location on Central will always be my favorite continue the good work you guys continue to make sure that you take care of your customers and put that Personal Touch on everything I am grateful and will continue to come and visit this locations for as long as I'm here."}
{"text":"Always good food, only issue today was that our services was not up to par, my order came out 10 minutes before my fiancée food on a chipped plate, mass confusion at the server section and they had to piece together our order as everything did not come out at once and we had to remind the server about our missing items.

it seemed that there were enough people serving but no one knew what the other was doing.

I enjoy going to the Central Avenue location better as they are more personizied with the customers, here I feel like a number and not appreciated. 

Word to the wise:

Before you plate any food to the public ensure that the plates, bowls are not xhopped, broken and are for the proper use. The gritels were in a bowl too small for consumption and you had to incorporate them on to the main plate.
 And servers if you see that there are issues with the plates glasses, etc make a note of it to have it corrected.

Don't get me wrong the food was on point, but it was over shadowed by the service, servers and plate issue.

Our sever only came to the table to followup on when the food was placed and to deop off the check. 

I informed the (whom I believe was the head server) last server that the croquettes were fried too hard and she stated that the will pass itbon and wondered if we told our server, we said no as it was hard enough with theblack of service we got, plus I felt that this was probably her first couple of weeks serving.

All in all we dealt with what we got and enjoyed the food and each other's company."}
{"text":"Best chicken and waffles I ve had. The Mac and cheese is to die for. Lolos is by far better then roscoes in LA."}
{"text":"Lo-Lo has some pretty good, deep fried chicken.  Even their grits was not bad, and though their waffle was okay, the service here was absolutely fantastic. They are located right next door to Holiday Inn Express, and I really enjoyed dinning outdoor, with plenty of spaces to hangout with your buddies. Their indoor/outdoor bar area is pretty ingenious. I can imagine this place getting very packed, but the nice thing is that the tables are far part and don't feel so cramp.  Love their high back booth too. Very \"sheeky!!\"  

Until then, Cheers ~ :p"}
{"text":"Great service, great food. I like this one much better than the airport location. Maybe I just enjoy the atmosphere here."}
{"text":"My first Lolo's experience last night. The place is cute and clean with ample parking in back or nearby. For a Monday night, it was pretty busy with families and two-tops. I was most impressed by the service, everyone was so friendly, ready to offer recommendations and patient when we couldn't pick what to have!  The chicken is wonderful, whether in a salad or off the bone, fries were good and the cornbread was sweet and tasty.   Portions are big, I spent a lot of time goggling at what others had ordered and wondering if they would finish it all.  Very nice experience, will come back again."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to Lo Los after hearing how great it was for years. So to review this, I have to do it in 2 parts...food & service. 

Let's start with the good, the food. We had fried green tomatoes to start and some variation of chicken and waffles (some liked breasts some liked darker pieces) and all were delicious. The seasoning on the chicken is just fantastic and the waffles are thin tasty treats that really go well with the chicken. I have no complaints with the food at all. 

Now for the bad, the service was one of the worst I've ever had. To start we were told there is only patio seating, when we saw at least 4 tables inside that were empty. After being sat we waited for about 10 min before anyone came to the table. One waitress came out to help 2 tables near us, looked at us and walked inside. She didn't even acknowledge that we were waiting. Finally a waiter came over and said he drew the short straw and was going to wait in us, when clearly he had a full set of tables inside. We ordered all food and drinks while he was there and he put them all in at the same time stating he wanted to make sure we got our food on time. So, all apps and entrees came out together. 

As much as I liked the food, I won't be back and I wouldn't recommend coming to anyone. I gave it 1 star based in the attitude and service this place gives."}
{"text":"It's a must GO! Chicken and Waffles has that home made feel food to it! If you are going to Lo-Lo's, you must try chicken and waffles since that's not all they serve. 
And do NOT forget to order your koolaid! Its the best!"}
{"text":"Excellent southern food with a flare. Can't go wrong with anything that I've had. Catfish, chicken, fried green tomatoes, waffles, Oreo pancakes are perfect."}
{"text":"Been here twice and the chicken and the sides are to die for. How ever the place is so busy don't expect great service, and do expect a wait to be seated. Definitely worth it  ,but they need more staff."}
{"text":"My family looooooooooooooves this place. The food, that is.

Service? Eh. There were plenty of seats available, yet we had to wait for a seat. Understaffed? Doubt it.

Our waitress (don't remember her name) took a while to come to our table. She asked for our order, and never came back. And I mean -- never. Someone else brought our waters. An hour rolls around... No food. We flagged our waitress down, and she went to check on them. On her way back, she noted \"I DID PUT YOUR ORDER IN WHEN YOU ORDERED, BUT IT'S NOT READY YET.\" Mhmmm... Seriously? It does not take an HOUR to fry up some chicken and waffles. In a not-so-filled restaurant. We gave them 10 minutes to bring our food, or we're leaving. No food, she didn't even bother making eye contact with us, and plenty of larger parties who were seated AFTER us received their food. So, as rude as this may sound, we got up and left.

Also, I don't understand why this place needs valet. Although complimentary, I'm pretty sure I am capable of parking my own car. They lost the keys to our car, and our car was also nowhere to be found in the parking lot. 

As much as we love Lo Lo's...this location lost our business."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of LoLo's for years.  No one can match their chicken - absolutely delicious!  Waffles are amazing; thin, light with a hint of cinnamon.  Mac and cheese, red beans and rice are right on the money too!  

I'm writing this review after having contracted with them to provide catering service for a wedding rehearsal dinner at my home.  Wasn't sure how it would all go, but the sales rep, Toyesha, helped me as I narrowed down my menu selections, and also advised that two of their staff members would be onsite to set up, make the waffles for the guests (so they were fresh, and not rubbery and cold), and help with service.  It was AMAZING, the staff were on time, friendly and helpful, the food was delicious, and we all had a great time.  Especially me, because I didn't have to cook or do dishes!

Bravo to LoLo's!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience, waited 30 minutes for a table. Took 30 minutes for a waitress to come over. Because the waitress across the way couldnt handle more than 3 booths and wouldnt serve us because it wasnt her \"section\".  Latisha was great, she is the reason why i gave 2 stars."}
{"text":"Lunch was awesome
The chicken  and waffles we utterly amazing  the chicken was so juicy had use three napkins, the waffles were so tasty 
Maria was fabulous the service was excellent........
Will be back asap"}
{"text":"Having recently moved to Phoenix, this is my favorite place to eat out here so far. The area looks a little sketchy, but maybe only because I've always gone after it's already dark out. I've been here three or four times and they have never disappointed! Someone has been outside the door greeting every time I have visited. Even when we had to wait to be seated, we were given menus to look over while we waited. They are always busy and with good reason!

My family came to visit, and I wanted to take them to Lo-Lo's for dinner. We all tried a little of each other's foods to sample different plates. I always get Chyna's Honey Hots. Six big wings served with ranch. There has always been a lot of leftover honey hot sauce even after I've finished eating, so they definitely aren't lacking on the sauce. They have a great flavor to them, and they're always very hot temperature wise and have a zing flavor wise.

We ordered the South Side Chili Cheese Fries which was a MUCH bigger serving than I had anticipated. There were 6 of us eating the fries with our meals and we still had leftover food AND fries. The portions are very generous. 

We all loved the waffles and various styles of chicken. One person at my table ordered the SoulFood Platter of Chicken Fried Chicken which is chicken covered with white sausage gravy. This was also great. It came with a piece of cornbread and 2 sides. One of those sides were string beans and red potatoes. This was probably my favorite side that I've tried so far. They are much spicier than I would have imagined. So much flavor, I loved this side! The grits were also good for the side order. The regular fried chicken was also very tasty. 

The prices are a tad on the high side, but well worth it for the portions and taste you get out of it. The restaurant is also VERY clean. VERY, VERY clean. I don't think I can even stress that enough. Not even a spec of dust on the picture hanging by our table. And the staff has always been amazing. Our bill for 6 people was between $80-90, which wasn't too bad considering the amount of food we had leftover and shared the massive plate of chili cheese fries along with our individual entrees. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"The real only option of Soul Food in Phoenix other than Mrs White's. LoLo's is the go to staple to get your southern fried chicken fix as well as wooo out of towners and try to show the rare glimpse of soul on display in the valley. LoLos has stepped their game up over the last few years and I definately want to give credit where it's due. They have the best fried chicken in the valley and have improved their side dishes. Perfect for family and friends, if you want a true southern meal, with nice staff, great facilities, and reasonable prices, check them out."}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's just moved 1/2 mile North on N. Scottsdale Rd., Near Old Town Scottsdale.  They were doing a Grand Opening to celebrate their new location... This is true comfort food and served with a smile.  They were too busy today as they were doing free chicken and waffles... With that said, our waitress \"Leslie\" had our food out to us in less than 7 minutes... Piping hot.  HUGE pieces of chicken and a waffle (could have been a little more crisp) with real butter and warm syrup.  Even though they were wall to wall packed, the owner, Larry was making the rounds chatting with everyone and Leslie was very attentive to our needs making sure our soda's were full and that we did not need anything else... All with the warmest of smile and not a touch of frazzle ;^) 

Highly recommended.  BTW, the last time we were here I had Shrimp and Grits.  Oh, so good. Will be back again."}
{"text":"The waffles are waffles, the mac and cheese is legit, and the chicken is done right (brined or whatever it is that they do). If you want good southern style food, this seems like a pretty good bet."}
{"text":"I was excited to eat at Lo-Lo's for the first time given the reviews and my love for soul food. I ordered the chicken and waffles with a side of potato salad and rice and beans. I was initially devastated that they had no candies yams available as I am a huge fan. The chicken was crisp on the outside and moist on the inside but lacked the burst of flavor I was hoping for. The waffles were flavorful but the texture was on the spongy side. I did enjoy the potato salad but the red beans and rice fell short with the chili bean flavor. Overall the customer service, atmosphere and song selection were excellent."}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's!!!!!! 

Amazing place. Obviously the food is amazing. The cool-aid is pretty awesome!

My only complaint is the problem which is awful....but it is what it is."}
{"text":"Bountiful plate for chicken and waffles. You could even change it up and replace with other side dishes. Turned out wonderfully and delicious. Staff was quite attentive as well. The location isn't great, however, but it will have to do."}
{"text":"Lolo's is a local soul-food joint where you'd find all your AZ professional athletes from the Cardinals and the Suns eating here while reminiscing their childhood and talking about their nana's cooking! Or so I assume... haha. But it is an authentic Southern style fried chicken and waffle place. Their chicken are not like that of Church's or Popeyes where they deep fry their chicken. Lolo's lightly bread and pan fry their chicken in a shallow oil and the result is that crispy yet chewy texture on the skin. Wonderfully seasoned and almost caramelized on the outside, it is just dang good chicken! Their waffles are thin and dipped in their maple syrup, it's delicious!

Menu is straight forward an self explanatory.  You can add more parts of the chicken from their a-la-carte menu if you feel like that order with two wings and a waffle is too dainty for ya!  :)  Service is VERY friendly and sometimes too good!  This last time I was there, three different servers came around alternatively asking \"Is everything ok with you guys here?\"  That last time one server asked, I almost felt like saying \"Do we look like we're not ok?\"  LOL  But it's all good.  They take good care of their customers and make you feel at home!

They have their original location in Phoenix on Central, but this location is more \"inviting\" for me and the neighborhood is not so sketchy if you get my drift...  :D

Fried chicken: excellent!
Fries: so-so.  Could be crispier
Cheese grits: creamy, smooth, yummy.  Could use some more salt.
Collard greens: not my thing, but if you're into it, go for it!
Phat Azz Samich: Better than their burger.  Ask for the sauce on the side, cuz if you don't, you'll gonna need 10 napkins +!
Kool-Aid:  C'mon now!  You gotta have their addictive drink!  I don't know what they do to it, but it's soooooooo delish!!  I don't wanna know how much sugar they put in it either!!  :)"}
{"text":"My family and I went here per a suggestion that came from my niece's friend.  So seeing I don't live in the area and I am unsure If I would be back to try again I ordered.

Betty Boop plate - The Chicken was fried very good there was a good crisp to it. But the inside was so moist. I didn't use the salt shaker so the flavoring was pretty good.

Mac n cheese - Was so creamy and cheesy a hit with everyone at our table.

Cornbread - Sweet and warm worth the try kicking myself for not ordering one to go!

Catfish appetizer - These alone were the best appetizer at our table. Fried perfectly and great flavor. I wish I would of order a double order of this!

Koolade Punch flavor mixed with Lemonade - this was cute and believe it or not refreshing and worth ordering so much so I had a refill!

If I ever make it back to Phoenix. Lo Los Chicken & Waffles is going to be a Must stop for me! If you don't believe me see my pictures  and go try it for your self you will be hooked too!

Also the staff was very friendly Especially our server Jaqwan. He was a very sweet gentleman. 
We were greeted by multiple staff with smiles and seated with in 5 minutes of arriving. 

The Bathroom was very clean and stocked!"}
{"text":"I have to admit that the main reason I wanted to go to Lolo's Chicken and Waffles was to figure out the Chicken and Waffles thing.  Perhaps it is my Midwestern sensibility - but it just sounded like an odd combination to me.  I have now been to Lolo's twice - and I still do not know why it works as a combo, but I now know that it works amazingly well.  

This was one of those rare places that I wanted to go back to as soon as I finished eating the first time - so I took my family three days later.  The family enjoyed it too.  Since then I am looking forward to my next visit.

The chicken was excellent (I recommend smothered in gravy even though that makes the chicken a bit messy and harder to eat).  The waffles were thin and a bit sweet and served with warm syrup.  The quart jar of kool-aid holds it all together remarkably well.  My wife even said it was the best fried chicken she has every had!

There were two reasons I did not rate it a 5 star;  1)  the restaurant is clean and nice looking but a bit crammed with tables - in addition to the conversation I had with my family I got to enjoy the conversations of the people on the tables to the right and the left of me and , 2)  Although the prices are not bad - the place is not cheap $10 to $14 not including tip and tax or so for a meal including a glass of kool-aid), and it sort of seems like the sort of food you should be bragging about how much food you got for the money.   Neither of these complaints will keep me away because the food was great!

In Summary, great food, great kool-aid, a decent atmosphere.  This is a place  that needs to be tried if you have never tried chicken and waffles and want to (even if you don't want to you should try it).  If you are braver than me and try the plate of deep fried gizzards let me know what you think!"}
{"text":"My profile says....

My Last Meal On Earth: Chicken and Waffles

Lo Lo's is the reason why.  Everytime I visit Arizona, I make sure I hit this spot up.  I usually order the 'Lo Lo's' meal which comes with 3 pieces of fried chicken, with 3 waffles and a scoop of butter with syrup.  YUM!  This meal would not be complete without ordering their super delicious Sweet Tea which is served in a glass jar.  

There are two locations, one in lower Phoenix, and the other in Scottsdale.  The one in lower Phoenix is the original location.  However, it's much smaller so wait times could vary.  The Scottsdale location is much bigger,  so dealing with long wait times should not be as big of a  problem.

Winner Winner Chicken Dinner, Lunch and Breakfast please."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this place. The food is amazing, the vibe amd people are amazing. I come here as often as I can. The prices are reasonable for the large portions you get. 5all the way."}
{"text":"The new spot is pretty nice. Definitely enjoyed the patio with the beautiful weather. 

Long story short: I've dined in plenty of times now and the food is consistently awesome and the service is always spot on.  

Only request: I miss the greens from their old spot when they used to be spicier with red pepper flakes. Either way greens r still tasty and I get the spice from the hot sauce."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. Food was ok, but had to ask for everything at least 3 times and half the requests were never fulfilled. To top it off the manager and bartender got into a fight in the middle of the restaurant. Truly terrible experience"}
{"text":"My fiance and I ate here while vacationing in the Phoenix area. It is in the \"hood\" but the inside is really nice. There were multiple tvs showing football games on this busy Sunday afternoon.  It was very crowded and the wait was about 40 minutes.  When our name was called, the hostess (speaking a mile a minute) said we had to sit at a \"two-fer\" or outside.  Mind you it was about 90 degrees.  I had to ask several times what a \"two-fer\" was before she finally responded and said a table for two. We took that table and it was TINY! I would have liked to have been asked from the beginning if we were ok with sitting outside rather than almost being threatened (which is what it sounded 
and felt like). Her tone was totally unprofessional. 

Ok so the food....I had chicken and waffles.  The good: the chicken wasn't by Banquet.  You could tell it was the kind your mother chopped up and fried fresh. The bad: The chicken lacked flavor. The waffle was small and just blah. Not bad...not good. My fiance had chicken, catfish, fries and mac n cheese. His fries were undercooked and it was visible. He said the fish was good but also a tad undercooked. He said the mac n cheese tasted like it was missing something.  Overall, I'd give the food a C. I think it is very overrated or maybe there just aren't many options in Phoenix. 

The service...two different ladies served us but once our food came, they forgot about us. A man I'm assuming is the manager walked by and offered us drink refills after our glasses sat empty for 10-15 minutes.

Overall...a so-so experience. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again but I wouldn't throw a tantrum if this is where a friend wanted  to dine."}
{"text":"About ten years ago, I was in Phoenix for the first time ever working a project and my dad came for a visit and we read about Lolo's and visited. Back then (although my memory fades), the shack was still there and this joint was in it's infancy and both the atmosphere and food were memorable in that fried, greasy, backwoodsy kind of way. It had charm and character, but now the shack is gone and larry has gained about 25 pounds and they have two locations and there is exposed lighting and nice booths and T-shirts for sale. Hey, when the cash gods give you your chance to cash in, you might as well, but some places don't sell out and its too bad that this place has fancied itself up. The food though was pretty much what I remember, although Waffle House has better, crispier waffles. The chicken is still top quality, but not the \"best ever\" anymore, hey something has too suffer when your expanding. The home fries were outstanding with huge chunks of real potatoes and a healty dose of onions and two colors of peppers on top and the sweet tea was terrific in it's mason jar for 3 bucks. It's still clearly worthy of a visit by tourist and local, but if your in a real good fried chicken place in the South, you will wait 25 minutes for fresh chicken. My meal came out in ten minutes which leads me to believe things are a bit different in that kitchen these days than the good ole days gone past."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. I love the atmosphere and down home feel. Never was a fan of chicken and waffles until now. Tyon Downing approves this post!"}
{"text":"Lo Los has the best fried chicken I have ever had.  Light, crisp, fresh, and delicious. If you love fried chicken or just amazing food this place is more than worth trying. Red koolaid in jars, eggs, waffles, and chicken to die for....mmm.  Its located in the hood a little bit but dont let that scare you.  This chicken is worth a bullet or two.  The building is a converted home into a restaurant thats been around for years.  Inside the setting is funky and cool.  Theres usually a wait and on a hot summer day that can be pretty hard to do outside in the heat with only a small canopy of shade and a rotating fan with a mister.  However, the wait will pay off when your food arrives.  I recommend going when its cooler outside so its not so miserable."}
{"text":"Original Lo Lo's....This really has to be the easiest review I have ever done. The service is great and very personable. Everyone asked us if we needed a refill or needed help (not just our waitress).. GREAT SERVICE!!! They really make you feel at home and have stayed grounded even though EVERYONE wants them to become a major chain. 5 stars. And did I mention how Great the food is. I really need to start trying other things but the chicken and waffles are to GOOD to turn down. If you have not had Lo Lo's, get there soon. Definitely at the top of my Yelp list.."}
{"text":"Very good food. But how are you going to be a \"soul food\" restaurant with no sweet potatoes or sweet potato pie?! C'mon!"}
{"text":"We have been to this location twice, Phoenix one once and the small spot at Chase Field once. Service has always been friendly, if a bit slow. You can't go wrong with the fried chicken. It is amazing! We also really enjoy the cornbread (huge, moist and actual corn in it), the Mac and cheese, and the spicy corn fritters. They have many great drink options as well. The Georgia drink and even the lemonade and sweet teas are great. I like asking for an Arnold Palmer. The waffles, catfish, grits, fried green tomatoes and greens are all lacking flavor and we would not try those again.  Looking forward to when the new  Gilbert location gets it's act together, as it is much closer and we would like to try something new at LoLo's. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I love the early bird breakfast of Kiss my Grits!  Love, love Lo-lo'!  Waiting to receive my to go order of catfish and collards!"}
{"text":"Slow service, portions for appetizer less than adequate. Waited a total of 2hrs and still did not get ANY food."}
{"text":"Everybody talks about this place and how amazing it is. So my friends wanted to go after a long night of not eating. We had a 30 minute wait so we sat outside. We sat down and ordered our food. I got the KK's. Everything on that sounded good they give you 2 eggs also with cheese and onion and I asked for no cheese or onion. I also ordered side French fries. I got my food and noticed cheese and onions on my eggs I asked for new ones because I didn't want that. I also did not get the French fries I didn't bother asking I wanted to see if they would put it on my tab at the end. They brought out new eggs and they weren't even cooked. Like literally my friends were also disgusted. If you moved the plate you could see the egg white just bouncing around. It wasn't wear like it was just the yolk not cooked it was every part of the egg so I didn't eat it. The fried chicken is good and so are the waffles which why I was satisfied because of those but it's nothing to WOW about. I had a very bad experience and honestly this will not be my choice for breakfast. Also at the end my tab had fries on it so I told them I didn't get it the guy went \"oh okay\" and took it off but did not even apologize or anything else."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get chicken & waffles. I swear!!! I live in Tucson and every time we come to Phoenix I have to come here. The chicken is so crispy and delicious and the waffles are great too. You have to definitely try the mac and cheese. If you're a sweet potato lover try the candy sweets. LoLo's is a must. We need one in Tucson"}
{"text":"Food took a while to come out. Better experience here than at the Gilbert location though. Good friend okra. Friendly staff. Creative shirts worn for uniforms - made us giggle. Significantly friendlier staff. Minimal parking and I refuse to use valet for a restaurant that is not high-end/fancy. Great food when it did come out though!"}
{"text":"Oh wow. The best fried chicken that I have had! It is not greasy, crispy on the outside yet the meat is not dry. Seasoning is not salty. The crispy skin just melts in my mouth. This chicken is perfectly fried. As for the waffles, they are crisp yet fluffy inside.

Now I look forward to layovers at PHX. It would be much better if Lolo's is located inside secured area."}
{"text":"Very Good. The thought of chicken & waffles never sounded good to me, but WOW!!!! This place is great and I can not wait to go back very soon. The chicken is not greasy, the tast is out of this world! 

The service was friendly and helpful while trying to decide. 
Go check it out for yourself- you'll love it too!"}
{"text":"The novelty of the place does impact it but it shouldn't be discounted. Phoenix doesn't have a lot of unique mom and pop restaurants so when you find one like Lo-Lo's that offers soul food in the valley, you should definitely check it out. 

The food itself was excellent. I've been to Gus' fried chicken in Memphis and the chicken here is just as good. The side dishes is what prevented this place from hitting 5 stars. While they were good, they were nothing special. I will come back here again.

One more thing, this place is safe. We went here on a Saturday night assuming the place would be full of questionable characters because the restaurant's location isn't in the best part of the city (Buckeye and Central) and at night on a Saturday, we were a little worried about safety. However, everything was fine. The diners were all classy with a great mixed crowd of African Americans and Whites and even the staff is mixed. It was rather \"preppy\" believe it or not. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Despite the terrible parking in which I am referring to the fact that you have to park else where and walked an extra distance to get to the restaurant, the awful hour long wait outside the restaurant with the sun beaming in your eyes and another wait of 20-30 minutes for the food after you are seated- it wasn't too bad. The chicken, waffles and lemonade were excellent. Probably best to avoid Sundays. It is packed."}
{"text":"Had to get the Malaysia Burger. Glad I did. Could use some heat as it's a little sweet for my taste but really good none the less."}
{"text":"In search of authentic chicken and waffles I stumble upon LoLo's. The waffles were outstanding, the chicken was amazing and my two friends and I hardly spoke a word as we devoured each bite. The place was clean and the service was warm and friendly. Do yourself a favor and check it out. I know I will again."}
{"text":"Amazing food, terrible service! 
Lo-Los has some great, fun food. I'd recommend any location but this one. The parking is very limited whether it's a busy day or not. 
I've visited the Scottsdale location twice and received dreadful service each time. Including, 20 minute wait for water (yes, you read that correctly), mixed up orders, inattentive service, and rude staff."}
{"text":"Honestly terrible experience. Our waiter was so rude, took 30 mins to bring us our water, almost a hour and 15 mins passed and she had still only stopped by twice the whole time we were there. One being when she rudely threw a stack of napkins at our table, and two to bring extra utensils. The table was covered in leaves outside and she didn't even bother to wipe it off, told us to \"wipe it off with our hands\". This was the WORST experience ever at a restaurant. People who came after us got their food before us. The foods good but not 1 hour and 15 mins / terrible service good..."}
{"text":"This is probably my worst and longest review ever so be ready Chicken Waffle fans!! We woke up in the morning after a long night of alcoholic beverages and decided to go to get Chicken and Waffles because what's better than that when you only got alcohol in your system??!! I had family in town and they were very excited to eat at this place because it has a good reputation. We got there at about 12:15 they have \"free\" valet but technically you're going to have to slide the guy some change so it's not \"free\" anymore. We had a party of 8 so they lady said 45 minutes (we should of left because this is where everything bad comes). The clocked had hit 1:30 and we were still outside and everyone else was moving right in.. A party of 6 went in and a couple more went in before us and we still haven't got anything so I ask the lady what's going on it went from 45 minutes to more than a hour she replied with soon and a couple of giggles I think she thought I was joking or something. After she called us in and we sat down and our waiter said the food is going to take about a hour to come out??... I didn't understand this part I actually was very confused because we waited in line for over an hour than we have to wait another hour? Why couldn't they tell us that before we waited the hour? Why couldn't the lady go \"hey you're gonna have  about a two hour wait time with waiting for a table and food do you want to place your order now so it would be ready by the time you got a table?\" At this point we just waited it out we ordered our Foods and yes it did take an hour but what got me really mad was they brought our appetizers out like 3 minutes before brining out our food wouldn't it be smart to push this first early because of such a long wait time.. Our food came out but all in different times half the table had their food and half didn't for about 10 minutes.. With respect the people on the table waited for us to have our food also but it didn't come out so I asked for the manager and asked her how half the food can come out and the other half isn't out yet and how we waited so long and nobody told us we would have to wait over 2 hours to eat at this pathetic place. The managers response didn't have sorry or what can I do to help or something like that it was a very ignorant pathetic response I was actually very disappointed because it was the manager.. She said would you guys like dessert when my food wasn't even out yet? When would the dessert come the next day?.. The manager sucks the staff sucks the service is terrible. This place needs a makeover. I didn't even eat my food because I waited so long I lost my appetite and I was very angry. I paid the tab and left no tip and I have never done that in my life because I am a business owner and I would hate to see that but I felt like I had he right."}
{"text":"the first couple of times I've gone it was delicious!  seems as though recently the chicken has been chewy like it's been over cooked our something. it's disgusting though. especially when that's what lolo's is all about. I'm starting to dislike it here though."}
{"text":"Nice southern ambience. Large portions and lots of variety. I got the chicken and waffles and it was pretty good. The serve different flavored of kool aid, I thought that was funny. Our waiter was attentive and humorous without being weird. Parking is not too difficult to find."}
{"text":"A one of a kind chicken and waffle joint near old town Scottsdale. Great ambience inside with a southern feel to it. Full bar inside as well and drink prices are reasonable and served in big mason jars. The kool aid drank is just like you remember having as a kid on a hot summer day. Sweet and tasty. Tons of options for chicken and waffle combos. Whether you want a breast, leg, thigh, wings or even tenders. And of course, they are all served with a big golden waffle. They also have all the good comfort food sides as well. Portion sizes are hearty and worth the price. Service is a bit slow though even when the restaurant wasn't terribly busy and plenty of staff on hand. Definitely a place to bring out of towners or people who have never heard of such a place that serves chicken and waffle together."}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's has been raved about by my friends for a long time, and they're very close to home. Took the kiddo this morning, and I have to say it was pretty okay. The waffles were room temp (the butter wasn't even melting), and my chicken was a little overdone. BUT around the overcooked bits, it was very tasty, and the fried okra was just right. The wait staff was super friendly and the price was right. I took half a star for the overfried chix and half because they don't have a changing table in the restroom (they're less than $200, and there was plenty of wall space). We'll definitely be going back, though, my soul food craving stomach will always be satisfied here!"}
{"text":"This was a pretty good lunch, I had the Lil C of two drumsticks and mac-n-cheese for six dollars.  I thought the price was a bit steep, but everybody's got to make a buck right?  Given this is 'the' spot for this type of food they can pretty much command their price.
So I placed my order and hit the rest room to wash my hands, by the time I returned to my table the food had already been delivered!  The chicken was pipin' hot, very crispy and juicy.  The mac-n-cheese was good, not great though.  My expectations were extremely high however given the number of Yelpers who specifically pointed out this dish as gastronomic nirvana.
Should I be in the area I'd return to Lo Lo's and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"This is the first location I went to and while the place was small and kinda shabby, it smelt great and we were welcomed with smiling faces. We ordered the chicken and waffles and I got a lemonade that was served to me in a large jar. The lemonade was a little too sweet for me but I've been told that's how they serve in the south. The food was delicious and fresh. I've eatin at the Scottsdale location two times since this first visit to the downtown location, Scottsdale is just closer to me. On our way out of the restaurant we passed Shaquille O'neal, who was there eating lunch with some friends. Very pleasant experience :)"}
{"text":"Let's all bow our heads and pray to the gods of fried chicken.

Thank you gods for blessing this world with Lo Lo's.  Thank you for blessing me with the delicious fatty goodness of deep fried Chicken thighs.

My recommendation would be to get the #9 Lil' Amadi.  In my case I just told the waiter I wanted a Drumstick, a Thigh and some Mac n Cheese.  He knew the exact correlating menu # and name.

My favorite uncle got the #2 Baby Ray with a side of Grits and a giant jar of Red Kool-Aid.  

The Chicken was so juicy and tender.  Fall off the bone with succulent delight wonderful.  The waffle, for how thin they are was perfect.  You'll think Belgian waffles are for wimps after having one of these.   There was a slight hint of cinnamon to them.  

The Mac n Cheese was addictive.  There was something to it?  Something I couldn't put my finger on as to why it was so good.  My son, who is also learning to eat big people food really enjoyed it.

My uncle said the he was about to go into a diabetic coma after eating his meal.  His name it Bruce A.  Read his review too.

The only thing that I could find wrong was the tap water tasted like it was dipped from the canal.  And they were out of Red Velvet Cake.  I know, what's this world coming to?!

They did have Sock It To Me cake.  I got it to go and had it for breakfast the next day.  It was perfect for breakfast.  It was light and kind of cinnamony as well.

As we were leaving I told the waiter that I live near Oakland and that Lo Lo's beats Home of Chicken & Waffles hands down.  The food, the service, everything about it.  If I could eat here every day of my vacation I would."}
{"text":"I have never left Lolo's not beaming with joy.  I love fried chicken and I love waffles, though not as much as chicken.  I believe that Lo-Lo's not only has the best fried chicken in Phoenix, but the best waffles as well.  If you enjoy either, you must come here.  You can also buy a mason jar of red drank.  This is available nowhere else in the valley.  The macaroni and cheese is pretty good, but not my favorite style.  The real show stopper besides the chicken and waffles is the Red Velvet Cake.  Indulge.  Seriously.  But make sure you share.

Also, this is a bad place for first dates because it takes a really really remarkable person to tear your attention away from the food."}
{"text":"Trying the restuarant for the first time. Betty boop is waffle and chicken breast. Drankin' out of mason jars is always fun.The food was good but the service left something to desired. Once we were seated a (group of 5) we waited until a guy asked if anyone had taken our drink order. It seemed like 10 minutes. We gave our food orders at the same time as drinks and the food arrived in parts before the drinks did. If the service does not improve, we are not going out of our way to eat there."}
{"text":"Love the food and the wait isn't too long either, love coming here after church service hallelujah"}
{"text":"In the not so wide world of Soul Food in Phoenix, my ranking would be:

4. Baby Kay's (although I hear things have recently taken a nosedive here)
3. Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe
2. Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles
1. Stacy's Smokehouse

Hubby might flip 1 and 2 since he has an addiction to the waffles. The best he's ever had, he says. They are very good, and so is the chicken, but I have recently discovered Stacy's superior version. The sweet tea is hella sweet to the point of total saturation, and everything is swimming in butter (Matt Poole must have taken this idea from here). The quality of the egg cookery varies quite a bit, and so does the red velvet cake (the last time I had it, it was burned). 

Will any of the inconsistencies keep us from returning? Hell no. It's one of our absolute favorite dining experiences in the valley. We go as often as we think our hearts can take it!"}
{"text":"The chicken was NOT greasy which was a huge plus, but the inside was a little dry for fried chicken and the waffle was mushy.  I thought waffles were supposed to be crispy on the outside??? These were not.  So, 3 stars.  Service was super friendly, but a little slow."}
{"text":"4.5 stars...

Dare I say it's better than Roscoe's? Well I'm not too sure about that just yet. Maybe they should battle.

Anyways! I really did enjoy my chicken and waffles from this joint. The atmosphere here is busy, a lil noisy, but everyone is definitely enjoying their food! The only thing I think I would pass on is their mac and cheese. I just didn't really care for it. The cornbread was awesome. And the collard greens were good and with a lil kick. I didn't get a chance to try my boyfriend's twice fried chicken... he ate it all. So I guess that means it was good too!"}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's is rigoddamndiculous. If you don't like this place there is something absolutely wrong with you.

Came here for #smunch this past Saturday morning with some of Phoenix' finest ... and I am positive no one was disappointed.. I got the Betty Boop which consisted of a juicy breast of chicken and a large, butter soaked waffle with hints of cinnamon.. when I say butter soaked, I am not even exaggerating. Delicious! Being the fat kid that I am, I also ordered a side of smothered potatoes, ie: roasted taters drenched in their homemade gravy. FYES! FTW! I also got Kool-aid. In a mason jar. Why did I ever stop drinking the stuff? I don't know. Memories of childhood immediately flooded my mind along with a 5 hour long sugar high. I probably gained 5 pounds, but whatever.. This food takes you into instant Utopia, followed by an instant food coma. I think we had about 5 different servers as well, but how can you complain about that? They were on top of their game!

Do not come here if you are trying to eat healthy or have issues with cholesterol and/or get annoyed with really loud drunk/hungover people (depending on the time of day you come, sometimes they're open till 3am). Oh, and don't even worry about the location, safe no, sketch yes, worth it, absolutely. 

AmazingaZING!"}
{"text":"Very good southern fried chicken and waffles.  Wait staff was amazing and the sweet tea is out of this world good. The waffles remind me of Waffle House waffles, and that's a good thing!  

I had the chicken tenders and you could tell they were breaded in the kitchen and no pre-frozen. My wife had the chicken and waffles and she really enjoyed it!  


Overall, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Arrived in Phoenix on a Sunday afternoon to attend a conference at the new convention center. Loved the reviews on Yelp, so I decided to head this way for some good southern cooking. I got the sense that this was a destination for a post church dinner, not unlike the buffets in North Carolina that I went to. Got the KK's (3 pieces of white meat fried chicken, waffles, scrambled eggs with cheese and onions, and grits) which was way more than I could finish, but I wanted to try everything. Chicken was very good, fresh and not too greasy. The freshly made waffles were yummy with nice rich taste (buttermilk?). I really liked the eggs with cheese and onions (the onions were a great touch!). Grits, well, being a yankee, I've never quite understood their attraction. The sweet ice tea was, well, a bit too sweet and I had to stop drinking it. The red velvet cake was unusual. Not sure what give it its interesting taste (did they use beets to color the cake?). 

All in all a satisfying, if not gluttonous meal."}
{"text":"Chicken, waffles, Mac and cheese and greens were amazing. As if someone's granny cooked it from the deep south. Better than Gladys Knights chicken and waffles as well!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible. The waitress never came around to refill our coffee, we were there at 9:00 am for breakfast. I finally asked one of the other servers for a refill and he gave me a look like how dare I. He did come back and filled my coffee but didn't ask the others at the table if they wanted theirs filled. Their cups were almost empty, and he never said a word.

To make matters worse their Belgian waffle machine was broken.

The food was okay but because of the service we will never go back. There are just too many breakfast places to choose from."}
{"text":"Seems like the places I love, I just take for granted and LoLo is one of those. We delved into the banana caramel pancakes to try something new and these were wildly dense cakes with a  tasty and sticky topping and fresh fruit on top. Not sure what the batter is, but it was a nice change from normal buttermilk style. The chicken was top notch as usual and no fork is ever needed to eat these breasts. The home fries were a tad undercooked on this day, so that was the only downer. Otherwise, it was open seating at the back bar and that is usually a way to avoid the lines up front. It still irks me about how they use valet, but as I stated before, no local is ever gonna fall for that tourist trap, well at least this local. Cool bartenders also."}
{"text":"We go in and are seated right away, which was a good start.... But, it went down hill from there. We order our drinks and food right away. Fifteen minutes later some of our drinks finally show up. For some reason the waitress assumes serving kool-aid in a warm glass is a wonderful idea, I assure it is not. It tasted gross and I look for someone to ask for another glass and there is no one around. Although several other employees passed by, NONE of them look very friendly or asked if we needed help. About five minutes later our food comes. I ask the woman who brought the food to switch out my drink and my dad asked for the coffee he ordered when we sat down. So after being seated for nearly 30 minutes we finally get our drinks. The food was pretty good and we then give our waitress ours cards. Within minutes she's back with our bill. We then ask for a to-go box and a to-go drink. She NEVER comes back with either. We had to as other people for the box and I leave without my drink. On the way out the waitress finally appears and says they \"ran out\" of to-go cups. It doesn't not take 10 minutes to figure that out. I'll be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"LAME!!! Why have a restaurant in hotel parking lot and not have a place to park your car???? Stupidest thing I've seen. Then you either have to valet your car or park it across the street. Won't even try to eat here and will never come back!!!"}
{"text":"Cool touristy spot with an excellent reputation. It was recommended to me many times but many people. I went in and ordered fried chicken and it came out in less than 5 mins. To be candid, I expected them to make it fresh to order. Not sure if this was just a hit and miss for me. 

Service was good, so I would try again but next time ask before I order if they make their chicken fresh."}
{"text":"As usual, the collard greens were hit or miss. And this time was another \"miss\". Waaayyy too peppery! 

Also as usual, the side dishes for one of the guests in my party didn't come out until after THREE requests for them...and probably 15 minutes after chicken & waffles came out. 

The waffles were underdone. 

Finally, as usual, the service was spotty."}
{"text":"There are two consistent tasting things on the menu. The chicken....and the waffles. Go figure! Don't get me wrong, its about the best soul food we have in the Valley. I'm from the Midwest and entire family is Southern...its certainly not the best I've ever had. In fact, not even close! But it'll do. 
Don't be mad Lo-Lo's lovers! You know I'm right about the inconsistent service and food. Your scrambled eggs will come out 5 min AFTER your main meal! IF you get them at all! Seriously!  The sweet tea is yum...although it will def put you in a sugar coma!!! 

Did anyone mention having to wait outside in the Summer at 110 degrees for an hour for a table? Bring a portable fan! LOL! But seriously, its great food! Just don't expect great service. 

Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon was the first time I'd been at this place.  I'd been wanting to try it out for years since everyone has always said that food it's great there. My mother in law was in town and she wanted to try something out of the ordinary.  So I remembered this place.  She's a big fan of Mexican food and when she's in town we always eat that.  Well since she was feeling adventurous we decided to go here.  Well let me tell you.  Everyone is right about this place.  Food it's awesome!! We all went with the two piece chicken and one waffle and my daughter got a side of mac and cheese.  We finished every single bite of the chicken, waffles and mac and cheese.   Food was so good we regret not getting the Lolo's plate which comes with three pieces of chicken and two waffles.  Lemonade and blue berry Kool-aid were delicious as well.  
Waiting was about 20 minutes to get a table and about 10 minutes for a waiter to noticed we were there and get our drink and food order.  But oh my!! Wait was definitely worth it!!!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. My husband and I share the LoLo's (#3). This visit my coworkers and I went for lunch. We were seated right away, unfortunately it took over an hour to get our food, and about 20 minutes to get our check. I have never had it take so long before. Don't get me wrong the food is worth the weight."}
{"text":"Everyone knows you can't go wrong with ordering chicken and waffles here. Always good. Always served hot, fresh and friendly. Whether dark meat or white, always good. 

The koolaid is lusciously sweet and you get a huge, full glass. The lemonade is yum too!

The real deal surprise of our visit was the ribeye steak and eggs. Mr. G opted to pay $4 for the extra 8 ounces of steak option. And boy was it worth it. We both LOVE ribeye and this one has got to be one of the best we have ever tasted. It was cooked perfectly and tasted fantastic. Fortunately I got a taste before he ruined it by putting his over easy eggs on top of it. So delicious. Highly recommend you try the ribeye at this already tasty spot. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"SO much better than roscoes.  Better waffles and certainly better chicken, can't go wrong with a nice jug of kool-aid either."}
{"text":"This was my first time and this is the MOST outstanding meal I've had in years!!  We all had something different and we all loved it!!  Portions are ENORMOUS for the price!!  The waitress was super nice and even though the food was slow to be served, it was worth the wait, the best Fathers Day lunch EVER!!  I will definitely be coming back to this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"My Southern credentials may not match up to other Yelpers, my great great grand uncle from Pennsylvania fought on the wrong side in the \"War of Northern Agression\".  I spent 5 years in the capital of the South, beautiful Richmond VA.  I met the most wonderful people in Richmond and in a short time I learned to appreciate  collard greens, red beans, grits and super sweet iced tea.  I hate to say they have the best fried chicken in Phoenix here because some Yelpers will go in with unrealistic expectations and be disappointed.  I will say that when I must have fried chicken, Lo-Lo's is at the top of my list.  The tables and chairs are packed in tightly, and it gets very crowded and noisy on the weekends, but this is part of the experience.  The wait staff is very efficient, so don't expect an overly warm greeting or the royal treatment like you get in Scottsdale.  I love coming here for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken and waffles which was great. I'm honestly not a huge waffle fan but these were THE best waffles I've ever had! My husband ordered oreo pancakes with sausage which was really sweet but still good and the sausage had just the right amount of spicy, delicious! My sister ordered banana pancakes and Mac n cheese for my niece and both were really yummy. The staff was polite, helpful and quick.  The only complaints I had was that it was pretty loud inside and that you can't substitute grits for another side. Other then that it was great!"}
{"text":"It was everything i dreamed it would be: greasy, fatty, salty, sweet, syrupy, buttery - delicious. 

It's worth the hype. 

I ate it all and regret nothing.

Well done, Lolo's."}
{"text":"First off, let me just say that this is my first yelp.  Go easy on me.

Visualize yourself shitfaced at the end of the night, stopping for a bucket of KFC because nothing could ever taste better than food when you're that drunk.  You with me?  LoLo's is that good, only sober, and in the morning.  Show up there at 955am on a Sunday and you'll see a line of brothas in their sunday best waiting to get in to this place.  And where that line of people goes, I will blindly follow.

Because inside you'll find: mason jars (!) of red Kool-Aid, good ol' fashioned Southern sweet tea, or whatever soda you want.  But then there's the plate of fried chicken.  Top it off with red rooster sauce and life is damn good.

Alternatives: mac and cheese

The waffles are good but to be honest with you, I feel like they just get in the way of the best fried chicken I've ever eaten.  (Sober or drunk)  I mean, you wouldn't just go to the original pancake house and get only eggs and hash browns, would you?  Only a goddamn fool would do that.  No, you are the person that goes to Mastro's for the steak, Sapporo for the teppan yaki, and Red Lobster for the, well, red lobster.  (you know what I mean...)  And since you are that person, go to LoLo's.  Get a jar of drink and eat so much chicken that you want to die.  It's a good feeling."}
{"text":"I have to say...I LOVE Lo-Lo's! The first time I head about \"Chicken & Waffles\" I thought it was strange and had no desire to go. 

After experiencing it for myself, I now know-  it's amazing! I swear there is something magical about those waffles. 

Just be sure to get there early as they always have a line out the door at lunch time."}
{"text":"this place is way overrated! food was mediocre and service was horrible. This was the second time eating here and both times were not great."}
{"text":"Not sure what has happened but been there twice since the move. Quality of food has tanked.  Chicken on salad was flavorless and partially raw. Dressing was artificially pre-made.  Menu has gotten large.  Maybe before they keep expanding, reset its quality.  Sorry to see the decline.  Now franchising out of state? Me thinks not."}
{"text":"I get take out from here all the time.  It is really unhealthy food but it is authentic, delicious soul food.  Consistently good from week to week.  The place is small and it takes a bit to get your food but it is worth it."}
{"text":"It took me forever to finally get over here for some reason, but there's nothing I don't love about Lolo's. They have amazing chicken and waffles. I love the drumsticks, so I always get those, but I'm sure the rest is great. The lemonade and kool-aid as drinks is a great compliment to the food as well. 
My one complaint is that it can get messy between all the syrup and grease, but that is the expected outcome."}
{"text":"I'm originally from the deep south so when I moved away, I started missing the soul foods.  I really was excited when I found this place on yelp so without hesitation, I went.  When I got there, it was pretty obvious that it wasn't the best part of the town but because of the location, it gave more authentic feel to the restaurant with wooden boards and steel bars blocking some of the windows.  

When you go in, the lady at the back counter will greet you and unless you know what you want, you have to ask for a menu.  Everyone is friendly and seemed like there were a lot of regulars who even knew the waitress's names.  I tried the LoLo's famous soulfood platter for $13.  I did not read the fine print so I ended up not getting the famous chicken.

When I got my food, I was about to go outside and one of the southern gentleman came from the back just to open the door for me saying \"have a nice day miss.\"  That was nice, I miss being treated as a lady.  The food was less than what I expected.  The fish was dry, waffle was more like a pancake and rice with gravy....I had better.  I even heard some guys complaining the price and quality of food outside when I was walking toward my car.  

*Food = ok I guess but I had better...*1 - 2 STARS* if this review was based solely on the food
*Service = ok
*Ambiance = *+1 STAR* the whole place is filled with the deep south feeling.  I'm definitely happier in the west coast but it is nice to be able to feel like home sometimes.
*Location = not the nicest part of the neighborhood but as long as you go during the day, it is very safe."}
{"text":"Normally I've had good experiences here but the last time I went it was simply ok. We came in and were told the wait would be 20 minutes, so that's fine, we stood close to the host stand because there was no seating in the waiting area open. Once people got up from there the manager at the front rudely told us to pretty much move because we were in the way. We ignored the attitude and were seated shortly anyways. Our server took our drink orders and food orders so all good there.. Fast forward an hour and a half later, we still had not received our food. Keep in mind the place was semi full. So we finally said something to a man who appeared to be a manager and he offered to go check on our food. He came back 5 minutes later with our food. Now I've been a server so I could tell this food had been sitting at the window for a good while and I believe the manager said something to the server about it. Unfortunately at this point we had no time to eat the food since 2 friends I was with had to leave for their flight already so we asked for boxes and the check (both were promptly given of course). No one apologized for the wait or offered to at least comp drinks or my friends salad that had cold chicken and the wrong dressing all over it. Pretty disappointed considering I've always had a great experience here."}
{"text":"The service here was horrible. They messed up the orders, forgot to bring drinks, and took forever to get to the table. The food was really good, but not worth coming back."}
{"text":"Great food, fast and friendly service. 
I can't pin point what the difference is, but I liked the chicken at this location better than the one in downtown gilbert. 
My only complaint is that the Mac & Cheese is a little too thick for my liking."}
{"text":"So if you stick with the koolaide, cornbread, mac n cheese, and of course the chicken you won't be disappointed. Chicken is perfectly cooked, crunchy, and piping hot. I was a lil disappointed however with thier spicy greens which werent spicy, and the banana pudding well it was pretty boring... no wow at all with either, but staff was great, place was clean, and LoLo's came a long way from the lil red shack/house that they started out in."}
{"text":"Hit the spot perfectly.  Chicken fresh and seasoning excellent;  tried both chicken pieces and tenders.  Waffles delicious and cakey--low-rise style, not Belgian.  Good, fast service.  Loved the drinks in Mason jars.  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 pieces of Chicken Southern Fried w/ 2 side orders & cornbread for about eighteen bucks with tax & tip. I got take-out and my meal was prepared quickly, in 10 minutes. 

The collard greens were the highlight, very spicy with some kick. The fried chicken was flavorful but on the greasy side. 
Give me a minute to elaborate.
One *expects* a substance fried in grease to be ....greasy. But that's not necessarily the case. You can fry something to a crisp, it can still be juicy/moist on the inside, without being sopping or dripping in grease. 
That said, the chicken wasn't soggy by any means. There was still some crisp to it. I licked my fingers when the meal was done.

A nibble of the cornbread and it tasted like nothing special but nothing abysmal. Oh, there were some dry smothered potatoes.

For a to-go order, I was pleased they packed the chicken in foil so that my greens didn't leak onto everything else.

Speed, packing, service bump this up to 4 stars. Food alone merits 3 stars."}
{"text":"This was the second place I requested to go on our trip to Arizona. My boyfriend isn't as into Soul Food as I am, but he ended up loving it as much as I did! We arrived around 11:45 on Saturday morning and there was a short wait to be seated.

Once seated everything happened very fast. Everybody who works here is very friendly and we were constantly checked on. We both ordered a \"jar of drank,\" Sweet Tea. It was really good. I could taste lots of honey in it. Yum! They also offer to go cups so I was able to take it with me when we left.

My boyfriend ordered Nay Nay's breakfast, two waffles, two eggs, and a bowl of grits. His waffles were delicious, loaded with cinnamon. Loved those. I usually don't like grits, but they were good here. There was so much butter on them, I don't know how somebody couldn't like them!

I went with the Lolo's Famous Soul Food Platter, and I chose three pieces of fried chicken, mac & cheese, and smothered potatoes. This platter is also served with a piece of cornbread. I knew it would be way too much food, but I wanted to try it all. Everything was perfect! The chicken was super juicy, the skin was crispy and salty and exactly what I was hoping it would be. The mac & cheese was flavorful and very cheesy. The smothered potatoes were great, chunks of potatoes swimming in a very peppery gravy with some peppers and onions. And the cornbread was great too, very sweet.

The restaurant is bright and airy and they played awesome music the entire time we were here. The bathroom was very clean. The outdoor patio area was really cute. If I lived in Phoenix I would be here all the time! We were both really glad we stopped by here for lunch, we left full and happy. I am sure we will come here again whenever we visit Arizona."}
{"text":"Believe it or not this was my 1st time at Lo-Lo's, and it will certainly not be my last! You have not tasted chicken until you've tasted their's, makes you want to slap your Mama and lick your fingers! I had to try the \"toy-toy\" the name peaked my interest, although Keenan was very smooth at assisting with the menu and got me to add a bowl of Mac-N-Cheese, melt in your mouth goodness! I got distracted and somehow forgot about my intollerance to waffles(sad I know) which came with my order so I made a trade with my friend and ate her Mac-N-Cheese too, topped it with Lo-Lo's very own hot sauce, I would  have loved to take a gallon of it home with me!
I almost forgot that I don't like eating messy food in public, had to resist the urge to gnaw on the bone like an happy puppy! 
It's true what they say, you never forget your first time! I'm definitely looking forward to going back for more!"}
{"text":"Lolo's its just a cool place to hang out, servers with a lot of charisma, fried chicken soooo good the seasoning bomb, my favorite dish SHRIMP AND GRITS, red velvet cake and cobbler to die for. If you are in the mood for some soul food, be sure to go to Lo-Lo's!"}
{"text":"The UYE Breakfast Club was at it again, and what better place to meet up than Lo-Lo's.The place was crazy busy, we sat out side on their big comfy couch waiting for the rest of our party to arrive, lucky for us it was a perfect morning. The smells form kitchen drove me to mad hunger. Unfortunately I can't eat waffles but I think I ate everything else that morning from chicken, potatoes, grits and even shared a piece of their oh so heavenly but sinfully good Red Velvet cake! Jaqwan handled our table with ease and everything was fabulous as always! It's making me hungry just thinking about it. I'll definitly be back soon..."}
{"text":"My review is more towards my server..Aneas. Charming, friendly, personality, prompt and attentive. It's hard to get good service so when I come back I'll be asking for him. Oh yeah and if you like chicken n' waffles...go here! :)"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is definitely off the beaten path and not at all what I was expecting from the amount of stars it's received but I now understand why. My sister and I had to make a trip out to Phoenix to see this Nordstorm Rack Last Chance we'd heard whispers about (Charles David 4\" black suede pumps for $20 btw) and Lo-Lo's was one of the highest rated places in Phoenix.

\"Left here\"
\"Right here\" 
\"Half a block and then turn right into the residential area\"
\"Seriously? Here? By the chicken coop looking place?\"
\"Yeah...\"
\"Is it safe to leave the car here?\"
\"Jessie-shush!\"
\"I'm sure all these people will watch it getting stolen for me. 

I'm an awful person-fine but you take one look at that street and tell me you don't feel the same. But all that matters is how awesome the food was. The drinks came in mason jars (tee hee) and our server was just so sweet! I loved the atmosphere and the comfy feeling in the air. 

The chicken was cooked just right, the meat was juicy and I could have practically licked the plate to get the last of the jalapeno juices and mac and cheese bits. Why can't I eat like this every day?"}
{"text":"I love that places like this still exist. Although I think the fried chicken at Cracker Barrel is better, the waffles and service at this place make it 5 stars...."}
{"text":"Average spot for chicken and waffles, although nothing memorable..........sort of. 

Fried chicken didn't have as much flavor as I'd expected and the semi soggy waffle tasted like something out of a box. Loud music inside and out during lunch. Really LOUD yo!!!

Blue Moon listed as $4.50 on the menu yet my cash munee bill showed it as $7.00.  After inquiring about it with several totally clueless employees, I'm finally told by an equally clueless manager that there's two prices yo.....one for 16oz and one for 22oz.

That's right yoyo...........$7.00 fucking dollars for my 16oz Blue Moon on tap.  Reminds me of a good old ass fucking, like the one provided at that soul food joynt I ate at a long time ago in San Jose.  You get my drift?  You know what I'm sayin???  I expected straight up service with straight up prices and I received neither.  All good.  All good indeed.  Just another lesson learned amidst all the chicken and waffles hype in this skid row hood.

I'm glad I tried it but I'd never go back. 

Roscoe's in SoCal is still the big daddy of them all, if you be craycraving chicken and waffles.."}
{"text":"Hours are messed up. They say they close at 11 but they shut down early so everyone can probably leave early. Not a good way to run a business with great food."}
{"text":"Food was alright it took 45 mins to get our food then it took another 20 to get our bill . The girl said it was her second day .  they should train their new employees better it wasn't her fault it was the training staffs Fault . Over hyped restaurant ."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles were bomb!! Also had the breakfast sandwich and that was awesome too!! Will be backbeat time in town !"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with our family. It was our first time. We loved it! I had the chicken fingers and everyone else had chicken and waffles and my one son had a burger which he said was the best burger ever. My youngest son loved the kool-aid on tap the most."}
{"text":"Better than Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles. #8 The Betty Boop which comes with a waffle and a breast of chicken is my absolute favorite. How can you go wrong?

Savory waffle, sweet syrup and even more moist chicken. Yum Yum Yum! Great service and delicious mac n' cheese... my new sinful pleasure. 

I take all my favorites to this place for breakfast, what a treat, a down-home good food get down in the heart of Scottsdale"}
{"text":"If you're like me from Los Angeles & looking for a replacement for Roscoes then this is NOT the place. I wish they would just call it LoLo's & not get my hopes up. The food was decent nothing special. Good size portions & our server was wonderful!  Maybe we came on a bad day cuz our eggs were way overdone & potatoes under done. I wish the waffles were crispier but now I'm just being picky.  The chicken was decent but seriously nothing compare to Roscoes so that's my mistake for thinking anything could. I may go back & try their lunch or dinner & see how that tastes. Complimentary valet at the front was great & they give you a cold water on the way out."}
{"text":"3 stars only because of the food. Service was sloooow and deserves 1 star. It took an hour from the time we ordered to get our food. It's Chicken and waffles- I mean what can take so long?! Place seems busy but it's because it takes so long to turn over tables at this pace. Kool-Aid was good but very strong, I diluted mine with extra water. Food was great tasting except for the pale, limp waffle. I like mine brown and a little crispy. 
They don't let you sub a side even though they cost the same? What's up with that? Good food but I don't think I will go back. Bad service and premium prices for inexpensive food. Spent $60 for 3 people for drinks and entree, no dessert."}
{"text":"Yummmmm! Everything was tasty, the koolaid took me back! Wish we had saved room for red velvet cake!"}
{"text":"Tried to order a little takeout. Just 2 orders of gizzards and 2 orders of okra. After hearing my order I was told they can't take phone orders and I would need to come order in person and wait. Not good business to pick and choose what take out orders they'll fill."}
{"text":"As chains go there is certainly a problem with the new location chosen for this franchise.  Should you wish to dine here on an evening or a Friday, Saturday or Sunday night, finding a parking space in the parking lot will be impossible  Apparently the Holiday Inn Express has commandeered the entire parking lot for their Hotel and the parking lot is \"empty\".  As for the staff, other than letting me know that Holiday Inn will tow my car, there is no other help to dine at their franchise.  It is hard to sample the food when you have no way to park your car safely or within 600' or their door."}
{"text":"I have come to downtown Scottsdale location a few times for breakfast after work, when I am craving some chicken and waffles. Food and service is good. I will come back again."}
{"text":"Had fried catfish. No seasoning whatsoever.  Greens were lukewarm and salty, guess that's where my seasoning went. My daughters waffles were cold butter wouldn't even melt. We asked this ditzy ass waitress for another plate because the waffled were hanging off the plate she never brought it, now she will wonder why didn't get a tip. Silly girl.  Per the male at
The table biscuits were hard as rocks"}
{"text":"This is one of those great little restaurants that has found a niche and mastered it.  The chicken & waffles here are simple incredible.  The fried chicken is certainly among the best I've ever had.  The sides are delicious (I recommend the red beans).  Even the \"dranks\" are terrific.  Great lemonade and sweet tea.  The service is friendly and the atmosphere very authentic.

This place does not pretend: it achieves soul food greatness."}
{"text":"All I will say is super yummy. Crunchy breading and moist chicken. Waffles were good. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Until about five years ago I had never heard of chicken and waffles, and actually thought it was \"code\" for something else.  When I finally asked my step-daughter what it meant, she (without making me feel stupid) said \"chicken and waffles.\"  \"Literally???\"  \"Yes, Literally.\"  Hmm....

So what is the first thing I noticed when entering Lo-Lo's?  Happy people!  This place has a vibe and synergy all its own!  From the hostesses that greeted us at the door, to the servers, to the innumerable people behind the counter, to the patrons chomping away...\"happy!\"  (Could be the kool-aid - ha,ha,ha.)

While eating chicken and waffles doesn't set well with me, there are so many other things on the menu.  We ordered take-out - me a terrific chicken salad, and my husband a catfish dinner with collard greens, red beans and rice, and a huge cornbread muffin.  Outstanding!

Clean and quaint, Lo-Lo's is a place you have to try for yourself.  Trust me, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I don't like super heavy food, so maybe that is the reason why I'm not a big fan of this place. The cool aide is too sugary for my taste. The chicken was ok but definitely too heavy and oily. I know it's fried but there are plenty of places that don't make it too oily. The waffles were good. Meh!"}
{"text":"This is a very good restaurant I would recommend the ice tea it is amazing and don't order anything else besides chicken and waffles"}
{"text":"I'd give them a 0 star but I cannot. Horrible cashier bad attitude and they could care less about going the extra mile. Wanted to order breakfast at 10:15. \"sorry breakfast is over\". We are the only ones around and the grill is fully open. Don't get it. Neither will they when business does not support the high rent here. Good luck won't be back."}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's in Scottsdale:  Wasn't happy with my first experience of Lo-Lo's.  The service was ok, chicken was dry, and grits were a congealed mass.  All of my food was luke-warm.  I'm not sure if I'll give them a second chance."}
{"text":"It's definitely a bit of hassle finding parking because the hotel takes up most of the parking (and they'll tow you if ya park in their designated spots), and I definitely don't like paying for Lo-Lo's \"complimentary\" valet. I usually just park behind the restaurant in the other business parking lots. 

Aside from the parking, the food is on point. I've never really cared for the idea of chicken and waffles, but oh boy, this place will have you thinking twice. I usually get the Betty's Breast combination (which is a super tender fried chicken breast along with a waffle), and it never disappoints. Their drinks are also served in huge mason jars, so you don't have to worry about your server having to continuously refill your drink. 

This place isn't expensive, but it's definitely not your Waffle House. It usually equates to about $12/person if you're just getting a non-alcoholic drink and a combination. The service is always decent, and I'll definitely be back when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"It's all about comfort food!!! So many things to choose. I chose lolo's chicken and waffles. It was a very fun meal. I would highly recommend stopping by! Lively music too!!!! Great waiters! Carl's the best!!!!!"}
{"text":"I so love this place I can't come to Phoenix without hitting up Lo Lo's Chicken & Waffle!! The good is awesome how can you go wrong eating chicken with waffles you can't!! Everything on their menu is delicious from the shrimp & grits the traditional kool-aide served in mason jars you come once & you'll be hooked!!!
The chicken is always deliciously fried never too greasy now the Kool-Aid can be a little bit sweet but I always have them add a little sierra mist to it that kind of dilutes it a little, 
Now for the cornbread it's all warm fluffy & buttery what more could one ask for.
If you've never had shrimp and grits this is definitely the place to try it! Plump juicy seven jumbo shrimp spread over buttery creamy grits with bacon cheese,  Green onion I believe they also have a little bit of Tabasco or some type of seasoning that gives it a nice little kick! 
One of the best homegrown family restaurants I've ever eaten at from the small little house to three locations downtown on Central in Scottsdale and also located in the Phoenix airport anytime you visit Arizona especially Phoenix make sure you plan on making it a stop that you can't pass by go in and indulge in all of the deliciousness"}
{"text":"A little overpriced for your basic southern food. We only had take out.. so this review is about the takeout only. It was pretty fast to place the order in and get it out. They had some traditional desserts but we stuck with the chicken and waffles. Cute concept, they have a couple of locations so they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"Brought family from out of town to my favorite fried chicken restaurant. The service was slow. Four tables that arrived before us received their food before us. I ordered 3 chicken breasts so I could eat one and have two for lunches later in the week. They arrived and two were very dry and finally the third was moist and yummy.  I asked my waitress to take two back and replace them.  She came back with two more and they were a little better but still not moist and yummy.  Her response was that \"chicken breasts are very hard to cook correctly.\" I was so disappointed. My family was less than impressed with their experience. This is not the Lo Lo's I have frequented and raved about."}
{"text":"I went with the idea of trying everything I could and trying not to compare it with Sylvia's in Harlem or any place on New Orleans. Well imagine my surprise when Lolo's in Phoenix, AZ wins BY A HUGE MARGIN!!! 
No comparison!! Food, quick service, friendliness of staff, and CLEAN! My OCD didn't kick in at all? Don't let the outside appearance or area scare you off. It is beautiful and rustic inside and just an overall great place to eat!!! I WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Went there Saturday afternoon for lunch. We were quickly seated. I was thankful that it was not packed with lines like some of the reviews implied. I think maybe the downtown parade had something to do with it. Phew! Ordered the Lolo's chicken and waffles. Came with a breast, a wing, and a thigh. The skin was crunchy and yummy, a tad on the greasy side but still very good. The waffles with butter and syrup was very yummy. Although I think I expected more waffle/crunchy texture and not as more like pancake type of soft texture. But it's still good. I'd definitely go back! I still liked Roy Rogers fried chicken from the east coast way back when the best in my distorted and disillusioned memory. But this chicken is definitely very good."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOLO'S... I live in CA and I want them to open a restaurant in Los Angeles. The food was great and the service was twice as good. We were a party of 10 and the staff made our dining experience the best. They were friendly, smiling, laughing and just a happy bunch of people. I love the kool-aid in the mason jars. Every time I visit AZ I will definitely be stopping by LoLo's."}
{"text":"Although the food is not great it is still a very fun place to go. It is not every day you see a place that serves fried chicken and waffles on the same plate in Scottsdale Arizona. If you go you have to try the Kool-Aid."}
{"text":"I have been a patron of the original Lolo's for years and have to admit I like the colorful flavor and mix of people at that location. But I live in Tempe and own a business right down the street from the Scottsdale location. I went right after it first opened and even though it was so shiny and clean and didn't have the urban feel I love so much, I can't deny that the food isn't just as delicious! Everything I have ever had on the menu is heart stopping good, literally! I only partake of Lolo's delight a few times a year, but it is always craved!"}
{"text":"We started with fried green beans. Our waitress at first sent fried green tomatoes but they quickly fixed that. (Common issue when the servers do not write down your order). We also had the Lo Lo's punch which is red koolaid with vodka and pineapple juice. Very good and strong! 

I was debating on getting the waffle with my chicken. I'm not a huge fan of waffles but I am SO GLAD I did. The waffle and warm syrup were to die for and a great accompaniment to my 2 delicious pieces of chicken. 

We also got a side of mac and cheese to split. It was really tasty too. Overall this was a great experience and the prices were very reasonable. I wish they had a location close to home!"}
{"text":"It is with great sadness that I write this review. For years, Lo-Lo's has been a favorite. We told everyone about it and recommend they go. I even own one of their t-shirts. However, our previous visit will be our last. Sure, they have never had the best service, but their food made up for it.  This past time, however, was different. When we were seated, there was an empty booth right across from us. We know that Lo-Lo's does not take reservations so we asked if we could sit in the booth. This is a common practice. It use to be that Lo-Lo's would ask you which you preferred.  We were told no, it was being held for the next party. The next party had come in after us and we had waited together in the waiting area. There were two of them. There were 3 in our party. The booth was larger than the table.  The party behind us were black. My family is white. The music was so very loud, we asked if we could sit outside after a few minute because we could not hear each other speak.  We were seated outside next to a large party.  We placed our order.  And, waited. And, waited. Our service was almost non-existent. The table beside us, however, had very attentive service. They, too, were black.  I ordered a non-spicy bloody Mary.  When it was delivered I was undrinkable it was so hot. Although they redid it, it remained incredibly spicy. It took much longer than usual to get our food.  In fact, we had to eventually ask where our food was after so long.  They had forgotten our appetizer. It was eventually delivered with our lunch. At that point, our main course just became cold while we ate it.  And, only after our food was delivered did they tell us that what I had ordered was not available. So, while everyone was starting their meal, I had to reorder.  We did not get drink refills (too busy catering to the table behind us, who never went without drinks).  We are very disappointed at how we were treated.  I have never felt like a second class citizen more.  We will not go back."}
{"text":"When I heard about this place I thought - chicken and waffles served together . 
I could not imagine this combination together but once I tried it I was HOOKED 

All I can see if Oh my gosh it is the best fried chicken and the waffles are light and fluffy and HUGE . 

I love this place - the only down side is it is a bit of a drive for me (but well worth the trip !!!)"}
{"text":"Disappointed...

Ordered a Lil Amadhi w/ 2 pcs of thigh.  

My golden waffle was soggy, not crispy.  

As for the thighs, one pc was acceptable and juicy.  

Other pc was previously fried chicken refried so it was old, dry, and tough..."}
{"text":"A must-stop over when you're in the Phoenix area. Best southern food i've ever had! Far better than Roscoe's hands down. Their fried chicken is nicely seasoned. Not too much batter so when you bite into it, you're getting the right amount of crunch without the doughy taste. And it's juicy too! Even the breast. Their house made hot sauce is perfect on everything. I also ordered the biscuits and gravy. Biscuits were soft and fluffy and the gravy was legit too! And the service we got was really good. Def coming back when i get another chance."}
{"text":"Breakfast simply CANNOT GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS!  Yeah, the service is very friendly and the atmosphere is cute and the restaurant is super clean, but the real reason people make the pilgrimage to Lolo's is for the fantastic food! The chicken and waffles are delicious! There are so many combinations based of chicken and waffles on the menu that allow you to choose based on how much you want to eat. The fried chicken is homemade and the meat melts in your mouth. The waffles are huge and they too are homemade and are divine.  This is a great place to bring company from out of town. Long live Lolo's!"}
{"text":"This place is so consistent without fail. I come here to have brunch with my fam, before we head back to San Diego. We're here strictly for the fried chicken and waffles. The fried chicken is so delish and always, always, always juicy. I can't complain about this place and can't dock a star for it because we always love dropping by here.

The staff is efficient and friendly. Service for food is pretty quick. But, then again, we're always here when it opens. Gotta love me so LoLos whenever we're in town. I'll even take some to go, thank you very much!"}
{"text":"The first thing that I saw, when I walked up to put my name on the list to be seated, were a bunch of white people and an Asian guy.  The girls taking down names were Latinas.  The first thought that popped into my head was \"Where all the soul brothas and sistas at?!?\"  You can't have a soul food place, without the folks who invented soul food.  WTH?

But, alas, my fears were washed away.  Apparently, they were smart and showed up early, before Lo-Lo's opened, to get out of the heat and seated quickly.  Gotta remember that the next time because there is no waiting indoors.  You either gotta stand under a tiny 8x8 tent they set up or along the side of the building in the alley way.  So not cool, when it's already 100 degrees at 10am.  

Can you see me sweating?  Not pretty.

After a 35 minute wait, we were quickly shuffled into the a cramped little room.  Our orders were quickly taken.  Not even ten minutes later, the food arrived.  My \"Toy-Toy\" (two fried wings with a waffle) was delish!!  The chicken was cooked to perfection.  Crispy skin on the outside, juicy in the middle.  Finger lickin goodness.  The waffle was great, too.  Slightly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  

I have to admit, this place is waaay better than Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.  Though, I've been a fan of theirs for years, the quality has slipped and the chicken was, more times than not, overcooked.  They're getting kicked to the curb.  Lo-Lo's is now my favorite chicken and waffle place.  

Despite the crampedness (is that even a word?) of the place, I'm still giving it a full 5-stars.  It's worth the wait and worth being up close and personal with your tableside neighbor.  Customer service quick and friendly.  Yes, it's a hole-in-the-wall place, but that's what makes it even more authentic.  It's unique, has a great vibe and great food.  Next time, I'm making room for some of the red velvet cake."}
{"text":"Time and time again I have given this place chance after chance to redeem themselves and they just come up short every time. If it wasn't for the delicious chicken I would never have come back time and time again. But enough is enough. The service is complete hog wash. Been here at least 10 times and the service is no better if not worse every time. No smiles, no greeting no personality. I really hate being so critical of the service. But you are in the service industry, SERVE!!!! It seems pretty rare to me to not see one happy worker. Not to mention not to see a manager anywhere on the floor. No systems in place. Our server shouldn't be waiting tables on opposite sides of the building. How can she give the attention needed to her customers?  Took 15-20 mins to get ketchup after asking a 3rd person. By the time the ketchup came food was already cold. Food is great, but your service should match your food. 
Updated******
I'd like to thank the management and staff for stepping their game up. We haven't been for awhile but I just couldn't resist coming back to give y'all one more shot......AND TOTALLY REDEEM YOURSELVES. The service was on point and the food was amazing. Happy to say we will be frequent patrons again. So glad to have my breakfast spot back."}
{"text":"Not impressed... For various reasons. 

Upon arrival, I was told 20-30 minute wait time for a party of 2 and I was seated after a 50 minute wait.

I was then seated in a small room in the back, which has high echoes, alongside two families of 4 and a party of 10, full of children. (Not that I don't like children.. But in a small cramped room..) Needless to say, it was extremely loud and almost uncomfortable. 

Our order was taken not long after being seated, but it took almost an HOUR to get my food. We both ordered chicken tenders and waffles with a side of cornbread and a biscuit. For being \"known\" for those dishes, I don't think it warranted such a long preparation time. 

I'm from the east coast and have had my fair share of chicken and waffles alongside the coast and the south.. Can't say this one ranks in my top three. Good for Phoenix, sure. But not with that ridiculous wait time. 

I also expected it to be burning hot since it was a long wait, but it was warm at best. 

On the plus -- the biscuit was excellent and very big. The lemonade/tea was also refreshing. Corn bread was good, but a little dry. 

All in all spent 2 hours and a half here and pretty much 2 of those hours were waiting around. 

P.S the serving staff was very nice!"}
{"text":"I was craving some really good fried chicken so I found Lo-Lo's on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  My daughter and I shared the Soul Food Platter (3 pcs of chicken) with a Waffle & Buttered Corn.  My husband had the Toy-Toy (2 wings & a waffle).

They brought out our drinks in the traditional mason jar-looking glasses.  And when our food came, I instantly smelled the intoxicating combination of fried goodness and sweet waffles.  The chicken was moist and crispy.  Not too salty.  The waffle had a great chewiness to it.  The buttered corn was, well, buttery and cooked well - soft with just enough bite.

I do have to say that I was disappointed in the Sockittome cake.  It was moist but wasn't very flavorful.

The place is super small so it wouldn't be a great idea to go with a large group.

Other than that...the food was pretty good.  Not THE best fried chicken I've ever had, but still very tasty."}
{"text":"I called and they said \"Yes we can do Carryout !!! 2 seconds Later \" ALICIA \" said NO\"\"\"\" Even though i was willing to pay with my Credit Card over the phone. 

How Disappointing this is for me and all my other Co-Workers that were going to order food. I don't think we will ever go back."}
{"text":"Very cute spot customer service is awesome the sweet tea is good we got the catfish  and chicken and waffles. Get of the freeway 10 west 7th Street  lots of parking  and they have take out"}
{"text":"Greeter was incredibly rude and after we waited for over 20 minutes we left when she barked we hadn't water long enough. They just lost our business.!its just chicken. No one deserves to be spoken down to. Banned!"}
{"text":"LoLo's is ridiculously good and the customer service is fantastic!!! You can't go wrong with any if the chicken and waffle selections. If you get the chicken and waffles there is a science to eating it. First, pour syrup on the waffles. You must eat the chicken with the waffle and syrup at the same time! You'll experience a lil taste of heaven, PROMISE!!! The \"phat azz fish samich\" is amazing as well! Gives you a reason I go more than once!"}
{"text":"Been here before and had some good chicken and wanted a southern type meal but it had chicken for lunch so we ordered the Salmon patties. There is more breading and salmon. The green beans and potatoes as well as the other sides were good to go back again will order a chicken"}
{"text":"This is our second time coming to Lo-Lo's and both times we were extremely pleased with the service and food. Our waitress Jaz was very nice and very attentive to us even though it was crazy busy. She let us know that there  was going to be a long wait and she checked on us to make sure we were good. Our food came out hot and delicious. We were sat near the kitchen entrance and it was nice to see that no one frown or attitude coming in or out from the wait staff."}
{"text":"This would have been a 5 Star a couple years back. I'm not sure what's going on with the management here but it's just not the same. The servers used to be better and the food is good but it used to be exceptional. My guess is when they started franchising the family has less involvement at the location and focusing on the corporation. Not my favorite place anymore. Sad."}
{"text":"Okay, had a craving for good fried chicken; and was in Scottsdale.  Went to Lo-Lo's; I'm sure glad I remembered where it was.  Red Velvet Cake is awesome!!!  But, the chicken, the chicken - ah that is a great memory...I never downed the chicken so fast...See that they have fish; so, will have to be back; my roommate loves catfish & I love cod...but, I don't know if I will have fish; when I can have that yummy fried chicken!!!"}
{"text":"Little upset they don't offer to go offer to go cups for the big Mason jar of Kool-aid I purchased. Especially since they have a to go section of there restaurant and you know they sell drinks to go."}
{"text":"Prettyyyyyy prettyyyyyy prettyyyyyy good! Everything that's been said about the chicken and waffles is pretty much on point.  Went here for breakfast and in addition to the chicken and waffles, I had the breakfast fries (chili cheese fries topped with an egg and green onions) which were fraggin' awesome.  Opted for the sweet tea this time, and wasn't as sweet as I had expected but still good."}
{"text":"Whenever I go down to Arizona to visit my brother I make sure to go to Lo-Lo's!
I'm so glad that he brought me and my mom here, it's delicious.
The chicken has always been crunchy on the outside and warm and moist on the inside. Service depends on who your server is. Once in a while we'll get someone who is inattentive but there I remember a really young bus boy who was really motivated to work. And another server was really prompt and kind. But, they probably do need to work out a system to make it more efficient. A place to indulge in a classic!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it's time for a review! Walked in and the nice girl greeted us right away! Although she said she will seat us as soon as all my party was here. 
We got seated right away and our server Jesse was very nice and cool! He was very friendly and was willing to explain the menu if we had any questions. My friends and I got the same thing which was #3 the LoLo's with 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles. 

The food was very good! The chicken came out crispy and very juicy. I got one breast, wing, and a thigh. The chicken tasted pretty good. Can't go wrong with fried chicken here. The waffle was very good too. It wasn't too soft or hard. Just perfect waffles to eat. 

I would definitely come back. Perhaps maybe try their breakfast menu."}
{"text":"For starters, food is amazing here, well worth the higher price. 

However, I have to take off 2 stars because the service at the bar is terrible. I've been here 3 times and always sat at the bar and you never get checked on, you always need to jump and wave to flag down any service, even though the bar tender is right in front of you.

You wait around 15 minutes for a coffee refill. Expect to be there for over 2 hours from start to finish for brunch. Last time I went my plates sat piled up in front of me while I was waiting to check out for over 30 minutes. The servers won't even make eye contact with you so you can get their attention. 

If you get a table, I believe the service is a little better but I have never had such awful service eating at a bar before and this isn't a one time thing."}
{"text":"The hostess here is terrible. Still waiting for a solid hour for a table. We were told our name was called (not true as we were sitting on the couch near the door where the surly hostess emerges). When we inquired why we were being passed up for a table we were then graciously added to the bottom of the list. People were literally waiting 5 minutes for a table. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"I have been here before and I usually get the chicken and waffles and they are good. Today is the first time I decided to get something different the soulfood platter. 3 pieces of fried chicken 2 sides and corn bread I got mac n cheese and green beans. They were delicious the green beans had lots of flavor and a little heat and the mac n cheese very creamy."}
{"text":"Words cannot come close to explaining how fucking exqusite Lo Lo's chicken is.  It's the crunchiest, moistest (hate that word), most scrumptious chicken that has ever blessed my palette.  Sides, equally to die for!  Corn bread, mac & cheese, greens, gravy, yams, & of course the waffle.  I'm seriously crying right now because there isn't a Lo Lo's in California. Roscoe's does not even come close to comparing to this place.  Cool aid on tap, how awesome is that, I had their lemonade and it was delicious.  Price was fair and service was exceptional. A small part of me dies overtime I think about Lo Lo's being 6 hours away from me.  They need to bring this baby to SoCal ASAP rocky.  How much is it to franchise? Let's make it happen captain!"}
{"text":"I checked for restaurant wait times on both Yelp and NoWait. It said \"no waiting - come on in,\" for Lo-Lo's, so we decided to go there, even though I had a bad experience there in the past. I decided to give them a second chance. When we got to the counter, the girl took my name and said it would be a twenty minute wait. I showed her both apps and said that they need to update their information with the apps so that it's correct. She shrugged her shoulders and said, \"We're full.\" She said she would give us the first table to come available, which she did, so the wait wasn't long. She didn't give us menus. The waiter that came to our table never brought us a menu, although he said he was going to. I finally got up and got my own from the hostess desk. For starters, we ordered 1 decaf coffee and 1 regular coffee. The waiter explained that he'd have to brew fresh pots of each (which is weird for a Sunday at breakfast time). Ten minutes later, he brought the regular coffee, and said that the coffee maker broke so he couldn't make decaf (I find it hard to believe that you have only one coffee maker in a restaurant this size). I asked for extra cream. He never brought it. Forty five minutes went by and then I asked him if he could check on our order. He said it was busy and they had to make them in order. Meanwhile, people who came after us were already finishing their meals. It took FIFTY minutes for French toast and bacon, which we were splitting. They didn't bring an extra plate. I had to ask for it. We had asked for Bananas Foster sauce on the side. The French toast came drenched in it. The bacon was burned and tasted like it had been cooked in old oil or grease. We ate a little of it and then asked for our check. We will never go there again. First of all, if you participate with Yelp and NoWait - update your wait times so that they are accurate! Second of all, get your act together in the kitchen, hire more staff, or retrain people. And there is NO excuse for servers to be rude to someone who is asking politely for a menu, extra creamer or to check on their order that took almost an hour to make. There's no excuse for rudeness, ever!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Lo-Lo's since it was just a little tiny house and I was happy to return to Arizona and see that the brand has evolved beyond anything I could've imagined! This place did not sacrifice their growth for quality either.  

Lo-Lo's gets it right and I love their menu! So many options to choose from and the names of their dishes are hilarious.  

The chicken is juicy and flavorful, the waffles are decent (not as fluffy as I like but good enough) and they make they don't serve their chicken and waffles with chicken tenders (my biggest pet peeve). Thank you for serving quality thighs, wings,and breasts with your waffles LoLo's because that is how this meal is meant to be!  Oh ya, they carry their own hot sauce.  Reminds me of Crystal or Louisiana Sauce and is a must on the chicken if you want to do it right!

After my first few bites you sent me straight back to the South.  I felt like I was in grandma's kitchen.  You guys are right on par with my favorite chicken and waffle spot of all time (The Breakfast Klub in Houston, TX) and that says a lot."}
{"text":"It makes me sick when I see this place filled with people feeding their mouths with this garbage. 1 hour wait for appetizers 1 and 20 minutes for food that was dry salty and flat out gross. Poor attitudes from servers and extremely inattentive. A disgrace to soul food, more like scraps for my dog."}
{"text":"Hands down the best chicken & waffles I've ever had! Being a SoCal guy, Roscoe's in LA has been a frequent stop for me over the years but Lo-Lo's in downtown Phoenix takes the trophy. The only time I've ever been called a CRACKER was at this place. I'm not even a white! Go figure. For the record, some people may think this establishment is in a rough/sketchy part of downtown. That's up to you to decide. I felt safe. Its blocks from Chase Field & US Airways Arena. So if you're headed to a Sun's or D-Backs game, you gotta stop by Lo-Lo's prior to get yourself some fried chicken. You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Fast Service and good customer service !!

I had the Betty Boob 1 chicken breast n waffles. $7 Chicken was crispy I added hot sauce Perfect ! Waffle was warm and moist
They have kool aid drinks and all drinks served on mason jar."}
{"text":"Seriously the best chicken I've had.
Juicy and flavourful.   Spinach with sautéed onions & mushrooms made my year!!!

He had Chorizo & eggs. Also very good."}
{"text":"Ok so I went to the new location down town. WOW!!! So nice. We ordered chicken n waffles, chicken strips, Oreo pancakes, eggs and bacon. The food was even better than I recall from way back when they first opened years ago.

The entire family left full and satisfied. Next time I'll save room for dessert like red velvet cake or banana pudding"}
{"text":"While in Arizona for an Incubus concert my boyfriend and I were staying at the Holiday inn right next to this nice quiet diner. They serve all their drinks in mason jars, and they have a hilarious menu!! If you have the time read through the menu and you will see what I mean. I ordered the chicken tenders with a waffle and oh boy I was happy. The chicken tenders tasted just like my moms homemade ones! Super juicy and literally tender I wasnt expecting that. The waffle was also really good, it had a good sweet maple flavor. My boyfriend got the thigh, leg, and waffle combo. The chicken was southern style fried (different from my tenders) he absolutely loved them. He could not get over the flavor and juciyness of the chicken. We were both surprised the chicken was not super greasy! All in all lets just say we did not need to go boxes ;D"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I never expect combination of fried chicken and waffles were so yummy. I fell in love with this place going for the first time. The chicken were fried fresh. The flavor was awesome. The waffles were delicious. If I get a chance I would like to go there again."}
{"text":"This place is heaven on Earth. Best fried chicken I have ever had hands down. Also, I've always recieved wonderful customer service from all of the staff at Lo-Lo's. Everyone is always smiling and happy, and I can tell they enjoy working there. Everything I have tried from here is more than delicious! Their mac n' cheese is the bomb. Their corn bread is spongy, sweet and perfect. Buttered corn is good. Smothered potatoes- delicious. The chicken and waffles is to die for. If you have not been here yet, GO NOW! :) I love love love this place, and so do the friends and family I have introduced to it."}
{"text":"I wanted some tasty soul food and found it at Lo-Lo's while burning time on a layover in Phoenix. The location is fairly close to the airport/downtown. I came at an off-peak time, so the place was fairly empty. The staff was SUPER attentive. I placed my order quickly, but held onto the menu to continue looking over it. Because of the menu still being on my table, I literally got asked by every employee if I was ready to order yet. I guess they don't have sections?

The food was pretty tasty. Fried chicken was done well and decently sized (not big, not small). Taste-wise, they were solid but not the best I've ever had. The waffles rivaled those found at Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles... delicious! The sweet tea was done pretty well... just the right amount of sweetness. Overall, I was pretty pleased with how everything turned out. Solid place, but not the best I've ever had... thus 4 stars.

L oved the waffles.
O rder fast and give back the menu or you'll keep getting asked.
L iked the chicken... but didn't blow my mind.
O verall worth a visit with solid food and nice people."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have the best fried chicken which taste like it was seasoned from the inside out. Also all of the wait staff are really really friendly and you never have to ask for a refill. I would recommend that you ask for pecan's in your waffles. A server suggested it to me once and now I have to get my waffles like that every time. And don't worry about which location you go to. They have the same level of service and same quality of food at both locations."}
{"text":"This place served its purpose and got rid of my growling stomach. I was kind of disappointed actually. I keep hearing rave reviews about how great of a combination chicken and waffles are. It's not that great. The food wasn't bad, but it is not overwhelmingly good either. The waffle is a waffle. The crust on the fried chicken was really good though. I'm glad I tried the combination, but this is not a place I will go out of my way for. If I never went back I'm fine with that."}
{"text":"My friend raved about this place so I tried it when I was in the area. The service was sloooow. The food was just okay. And the music was too loud. I've never had chicken and waffles and was expecting something a little more unique that what I can prepare at home. Did I mention the service was slow?? I don't think I'd choose to go back here again on my own. Only if a friend begged me to."}
{"text":"The new Lo-Lo's on Scottsdale Road is definitely an upgrade from the old location one block south. It has a much more open atmosphere inside and the staff seem more upbeat. However, the food is still the same. The seasoning on the chicken is not quite there yet. I would almost call it bland at times. Don't get me wrong, it looks fabulous when it comes out of the kitchen. The dirty rice is truly amazing as is the sauteed spinach. The mac and cheese looks suspect since it doesn't look baked. The catfish is better than average, but I was expecting more. For my money, Bojangles has better flavored chicken."}
{"text":"LoLo's  tragically, I have tried to maintain a plan to loose some extra pounds. For you are the best place in town to pack on the spare bulk. Nothing at LoLo's could be considered \"healthy\". But everything can be considered extra tasty.

Take a drive, or maybe a walk to LoLo's and fill up on some of the best, southern style, down home food you will find west of Louisiana.

Just bring a bib, and an appetite"}
{"text":"First time trying  the restaurant.  Place looked clean and friendly.  They told us it was a 20 to 25 minute wait but they were not overly  busy . We got seated  in 15 minutes.  Waiter  was very attentive.  We needed more time once we placed the order it took about 40 minutes  to get our food . Worse they brought the last order 10 minutes  later with no apologies.  . I had their three pieces  of chicken  with two sides.  Red beans with rice and fried  okra. .there was not much h beans.  Mostly rice . The okra was swimming in oil. I did like the corn bread.  Chicken was crunchy.  But overcooked and no seasoning. Sorry but Popeye is a better. Choice.  The waitress  disappeared  on us for 15 minutes.  . Food looked fresh but it was marginal"}
{"text":"I don't want to be a snob, but coming from LA we were expecting some great things out of this place. First the wait was incredibly long, which started us off on the wrong foot. The place isn't incredibly big, but tables fill the middle portion, so we weren't sure why it took so long.

Anyways onto the food. We decided to try their traditional fried chicken and waffles and were underwhelmed. The waffles were good (but how can you mess those up), but the chicken was decent. The pitfall was the gravy. I like gravy, but the gravy here was too much. My chicken was doused and drowning in it. I didn't get the fried chicken feel that I wanted. 

Best part about the place was the kool aid. We both forgot how good kool aid was. It was so good that the little one drank a quarter of the mason jug. Staff was friendly, but food was okay. Hopefully the other location is better."}
{"text":"I know, I know, another chicken and waffles place. I mean, how hard is it to mess up chicken and waffles. The only reason I went here is because Charles Barkley recommended it, and if CB knows anything, it's unhealthy food. 

I'm done rationalizing my decision to go there but I don't want to make it a trend of going to these somewhat gimmicky chicken and (insert breakfast item here) restaurants. 

verdict: The food was really good. The sides were amazing too, I got the mac-n-cheese; a gloopy cheesy mess, just the way I like it.

P.S. I thought Roscoe's in LA was better."}
{"text":"The food is really good. It isn't Roscoes, but it's the closest you'll get in AZ. My experiences are very hit or miss in terms of customer service. Sometimes it's fast, friendly and enjoyable. Other days like today, I find myself waiting over 20 minutes for a to go order when there's nowhere near a full house. It seems they are under-staffed, but they don't have a hiring sign hung up so they must be okay with it. Food is outstanding but just be prepared for anything when it comes to the service. One could argue that shitty service is actually an indicator of good food, which might be a reasonable theory when you look at this place."}
{"text":"Had an excellent brunch Sunday.  Just a warning the wait is a long and I was one of the lucky ones that found a seat inside to wait. I did notice a lot of people waiting outside in the heat for well over a half an hour.   Service staff was super friendly and our server Michael had stopped in several times checking if I needed anything which was nice cause the place was packed.  Got the number 3 lo lo's combo with chicken and waffles, opted for all white meat which was a couple of dollars extra.  Chicken and waffles were perfect! Portion sizes are huge, I only got about 1/3rd down, and took the rest home for dinner.  Very good food here, I probably will only come back once or twice a year though cause it's such naughty food.  I will take visitors here for a splurge though!"}
{"text":"I really wanted Lo Lo's to do well at the airport. It's refreshing to see the corporate places out and local business in. I was severely disappointed. I got my food as soon as they called my name and I started to dig in to some tough chicken and some really limp waffles. The flavors were there, but none of the magic like the Central location."}

{"text":"Visit 1:
The first time I came i wasn't impressed. I came on a weekend waited almost an hr to take a seat. Server was running around like chicken with its head cut off. 
The Chilli cheese fires were absolutely delicious it was suppose to be an appetizer but i made them my course meal.

Visit 2:
I came on a Wednesday 2pm. It was perfect!! No line and waiter was on top of her game. 

For my drink or as the menu labels them \"dranks\":
Bloody Bacon Mary- i'm always looking to try something different. Bacon in my vodka cocktail isn't something everyone serves so i figured give it a shot. I wont order this item again but then again I don't like v8.
Mojitos are good. The balance of mint to sweetness was ride up my alley. I prefer a bit most alcohol punch but I can't complain this isn't a bar. 

Too my surprise they have BEER ON TAP. I stuck to Goose Island IPA this stuff is so good. Bourbon pigment, hoppy/malt flavor a little low in alcohol (below 6% abv) but perfect for lunch time. 

Appetizers:
 Catfish Beignets they were white and tender on the inside and crispy on the outside their dipping sauce complimented the dish exceptionally good. The fried mushrooms and zucchini don't compare to the catfish.
Lunch:
Chicken/Waffles its their specialty so they really can't screw this up. Good chicken and good waffles.

In closing statement
Would I come back...Yes. 
Is it worth waiting an hour wait....Nope not in my opinion.
I'll come back during not so busy hours."}
{"text":"I'm a fan but small things that make me take away a star. The food is good and I'm always stuffed when I leave but I hate that I have to order some sides a la carte if I order chicken/waffles. Again.. just a weird thing about me. The food is good and the tea/drinks are FULL of sugar. Sweet tea is SWEET. Red drank and other Kool-Aid based drinks are super sugary. Delish but just know... you'll feel your teeth rotting as you drink. So good and so bad at the same time."}
{"text":"Leaning more toward a 3.5 star rating.

I've been coming to Lo Lo's since before the remodel at this location. Recently it's has been a hit or miss. First starting with the wait. I'm used to waiting at least 30 to 45 minutes for a table so the wait time doesn't bother me because I expect it.

I'm not really sure what has happen to the customer service here but ever since the remodel it has not been a priority. Any contact that I have had with any of the staff whether it be the hostess, waiters/waitresses, and even the manager has been negative. After having to deal with the parking nightmare and the wait for a table you expect the experience to get better from there. Not the case here. The only thing that keeps me coming back is the food. 

I usually order the smothered chicken and waffles or the fried catfish with mac and cheese and greens. There was only one time that I had a problem with the food not coming out hot and in a timely manner. They recently came out with an alcoholic beverage menu but I prefer the kool aid. They also have a breakfast menu. You will never leave hungry and the prices are very reasonable. 

I really hope that they are able to turn this place around when it comes to customer service. I always recommend this place to anyone visiting Phoenix but with the service declining I'm hesitant to throw their name out there as a recommendation."}
{"text":"Sorry but Lo-Lo's is highly overrated. 

I don't know where to even begin with Lo-Lo's... I guess I will start by saying I will never be back! 

The food is OVERRATED. Anyone who can actually cook will tell you that their fried chicken isn't even close to die for. It's just average fried chicken. Their collard greens are garbage as well. The greens from Honeybears aren't even that good but those definitely trump Lo-Lo's. The Mac and Cheese sucks! I know I am not the only one who thinks that too. Serving sizes are not generous at all. And the price is way too expensive. 

The service is about as average as it gets. Maybe this is due to the fact that the servers are always so busy but most act like the could give two shits about their tip. The WAIT is horrendous. It's always at minimum a 35 minute wait for my party. Not to mention if anyone shows up who is consider a \"somebody\" they will usher them past everyone right to their table.

Anyways, I hate to hate but the main reason that this place is so successful is because the have entered into a niche market in the valley. It's not because of their food, service, or management. 

Pros
-lots of seating
-great drinks

Cons
-Service
-Food
-Wait times
-atmosphere
-Too expensive
-overall unfriendly staff"}
{"text":"went for the first time a couple of weeks after the gilbert location opened.  I know everyone talks about the fried chicken and waffles - I'm not much of a fan of either.  however, put a shrimp and grits on the menu and I am ordering that!  Lo-Lo's shrimp and grits is a little different with some bacon and delicious. Next time you are there you have to try!"}
{"text":"Food is okay but pricey for the poor service they offer at this location. We waiting for over an hour and a half for our food and our drinks were only brought out after I had to hunt someone down. When I spoke with the manager he didn't really seem to care either. We will not be returning. Not worth the time."}
{"text":"It has been three years since I last visited Lolo's restaurant.  Sure, I have had Lolo's at the airport and as a food truck.  

I have raised my previous three stars to four.  The additional star is that I found the fried  chicken this time to be less salty and quite good.  I had the coleslaw as a side and found it rather nice, creamy and with a subtle back taste that was refreshing.  The big plus of a visit to Lolo's is the capable and friendly staff, not too much in your face and not too absent.  A nice mix.  

I will be back soon for breakfast."}
{"text":"Fantastic all around!!  The service is great and the chicken and waffles I had were delightful. The pieces were plump with an ok amount of crunch. The waffle was large but thin which is the way I like it. It's a very popular place with the tables filling up quickly on a Saturday morning. Very impressed and will definitely return for breakfast next time I'm in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Food is always good and plenty.  I need self control when I'm in this place as I will want everything from the menu."}
{"text":"I ate here a few weeks ago and while I was waiting for a refill I saw our waitress pick her nose before she came to our table. I was so grossed out I had to leave. I will not return here. If this is happening in the front what is going on in the back?"}
{"text":"I keep telling my friends about this joint. I have been there twice once on a Sunday and they're pretty busy. I def recommend trying them out during the week when its a little slower. Anyways, this is THE soul food spot in Phoenix. I had the chicken and waffles and my wife had the soul food platter with cod and collard greens and rice and beans.  I haven't tried their new spot in So. Scottsdale yet.

The kids had chicken tenders and grits and waffles. I had a arnold palmer as the tea was a little on the sweet side. The kids had jar-o-drank which translates to sweet red kool aid. 

I was in a food coma all day, but couldnt leave  without the red velvet cake to go."}
{"text":"WOW! Everything about this place screams Los Angeles Roscoes Chicken & Waffles. They r a little cheaper than Roscoes & the Mac & Cheese is terrible, but the food is more than identical. The food is friggin great & so is the staff. If u need a waffle this is the place. Avoid Waffle House"}
{"text":"We went for our first trip this morning. When we drove by at about 9:45 a.m. it looked abandoned. So we were not sure if it was still operating. After waiting for a few minutes a few folks started arriving so we figured it will open soon. When it opened we were really surprised how many tables it held as it looks like it might fit three at best. Now mind you it is not huge, but larger than it looks. There were five of us and we fit well. We were greeted by a very nice young lady. In fact I would say this place has the cutest staff around. What I mean by that is they were all smiling friendly adorable folks.
We ordered our food and were attended to for drinks. Very large mason jars are used for the drinks and filled to the top. The food came. Four of us chicken and waffles and one had the rice and gizzards with gravy. We all loved the chicken, very tasty and quite crispy. Three of us liked the waffles, I being the dissenter. There was nothing wrong with them, it is just personal taste. I did not like the cinnamon added. We all took a bite of the rice and gizzards. Really good flavour with wonderful gravy. A good time had by all."}
{"text":"Went there for the 1st time yesterday while visiting Phoenix for the 1st time with friends. The wait was 30 minutes but that wasn't a problem, there is a seating area on the side of the building and if you want to stand while waiting there is an area with water misters there to keep you cool. But all worth it, the food is delish!

The staff is very friendly and very attentive to the customers."}
{"text":"It really bothers me to write this review....I'll start by saying that. I had been sooo pumped and the hype was out of control for this place. 

The customer service was WONDERFUL. It was a very warm environment. We went on a Sunday, so of course it was over booked and quite crowded. The wait staff handled it with ease. 

I ordered the meal with the waffles, the grits, eggs, and chicken. The grits, eggs and waffles--ALL wonderful. The chicken was dry. I didn't realize this, until I ordered chicken from Church's a week later and realized, \"Lolo's chicken was dry...\"

I would go again....but I will probably avoid the chicken to be honest."}
{"text":"I went to see friend Carlos Rivas' art that was recently installed.  

This is not my usual fare, but for that meal once in awhile that is just about enjoying comfort food without a thought of nutritional value, I'd definitely come back.

I enjoyed the chicken breast, it was fried to perfection and not too greasy.  The waffle was the perfect complement.  I tasted my friend's tea, which was diluted in half and it was still way too sweet.  I am just not used to that much sugar.

Everything else was just as I expected, and it satisfied the half of my DNA that prides itself on its Southern roots.  

If you're overly concerned about health and don't have it in you to once in awhile just go eat something for the taste, please don't go here.   Your whining will distract me from enjoying my meal. 

If you \"get\" that once in awhile a meal like this is perfectly fine, come on over to my table.  We'll share a few sides and enjoy some Southern comfort together!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh. Lo Lo's is DA place to be, hands down. Yes... All the rumors are true... Lo Lo's is the best restaurant you will ever eat at! I love it there! Everyone is so chill and friendly, it makes you definitely want to come back. Do not order a soda. Do not order a water. Order Kool Aid with Lemonade! I get the red Kool aid with lemonade and I'm never let down. Their Kool aid is always on tap, so make sure to ask for those free refills and a to-go cup. 10/10 would recommend their chicken and waffles... It's what their famous for! Duh! Don't get me wrong, their Oreo pancakes and red velvet cake are to die for. But you can always take that to-go after you eat those waffles and fried chicken. Their waffles are fluffy and golden while their chicken is crunchy and fried. So yummy! I'm getting hungry while writing this. You won't be disappointed."}

The atmosphere was pretty relaxed even though they were kinda busy, not too loud! That's a huge bonus! The outside patio was pretty cool.

{"text":"You know what reminded me to write a review of Lolo's?  

This conversation: 

Sunday morning my friend says to me, \"You looked really drunk at Lolo's last night.\" 
Me: \"What do you mean?\"
Friend: \"You were all red and splotchy.\"
Me: \"So, it wasn't the fact that I was eating fried chicken and a waffle at 3am that made me look drunk?\"
Friend: \"Hey, we were all drunk, you just have really light skin and it shows.\"

I have decided to not put Lolo's on the drunk late night eats rotation.  It's too bright in there and apparently my Swedish skin gives my drunkenness away.  Also, the floor is slippery when wet and it was raining that night.  I skidded across the tile right in front of a police officer.  Luckily, I never drive when I plan on drinking so it didn't really matter. 

I got the Betty Boop, I think.  It's a fried juicy breast and a waffle.  I felt like the fried juicy breast was a little over fried.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good and lets face it, if food doesn't taste out of this world when you're drunk it can't really be that good in reality.  The waffle, however, was delicious.  I don't know, I'm not from the South and I was drunk so you probably shouldn't take this review too seriously."}
{"text":"Delicious Hot and juicy fried chicken?  Check.  Golden waffles covered in warm butter and syrup?  Check.  Kool-Aid served in a mason jar?  Check check!  Awesome food, just as expected.  Only 4 stars because of long waits for seating and service.  Even so, when you want chicken and waffles this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"The new incarnation of what used to be at the corner of Thomas and Scottsdale Rd. is conveniently located (now at 3133 N. Scottsdale Rd.) and features a well-appointed interior. Note the signs around the parking area and make sure you're not parked in the spaces of the adjacent hotel to avoid the risk of being towed. The waffles that came with the chicken were good; the fried chicken I had was tasty but on the dry side. The green beans I had on the side were mushy and tasteless. There are items on the menu I'd like to try in the future, although I'm not sure if the pricey fare would be worth the trip. 2.5 stars rounded up to 3 because the interior really looks nice."}
{"text":"Don't bother if you want to eat!! We came for dinner was seated immediately. Server came over took order.  Then the food came one dish at a time with 20 minutes in between each dish until an hour passed and we all hadn't received our food.  Asked for manager at least five times and he never came out. Finally after an hour he came out of kitchen with out the food. So my suggestion is if your coming by yourself you will be served at the same time if you come with others don't expect to eat together or at all!!!"}
{"text":"First time at Lolos chicken and this is the worse experience EVER!  We had a reservation put a down payment for a room and we show up a bit early but we're made to wait over an hour.  The waiting is not the bad thing it was the attitude of the hostesses there.   I'm from out of state and I've never been to Lolos I was excited to eat there as their menu has a lot of variety and delicious things.  Back to the stank attitudes, we had a large party their waiting area is small we were constantly harassed to move out of the entry which we were not blocking. By he tried to make us go outside in 106 wether.  Sorry I'm not used to that heat and even with misters outside I was not going to go.   The approach and attitude these girls oozed was just plain Ghetto.  Their tone, body language and demeanor was just foul!  Their manager Antjuan (the one with the gold grill) also not helpful.  I recommend instead of adding more gold on his teeth he invest in toothpaste and breath mints the odor seeping from his mouth when speaking was horrendous!  

When we finally got situated everything was great the server was awesome and he is the only reason I am giving u two stars!  Food was delicious our server was great but it's the hostesses that need people skills there was about 4 or 5 girls but these two where the worst!!!!"}
{"text":"Holy smokes ~ what can I say?! 

AWESOME food & AWESOME music. How can you not feel insane amounts of joy when there is a huge plate of hot, crunchy, fried chicken in front of you, a big jar of bright Kool-Aid by your side, and  Montell Jordan singing in the background?! I am in love ~~~~ 

Besides the food being so great, what I like about this place is the service and the people. The people that work there are so friendly and full of smiles. Everyone eating there is also so happy and enjoying themselves - it's just a great place to relax and enjoy yourself with good people and great food :)"}
{"text":"\"Mason jars make me excited\"

This was one of those places you get excited about because it's soul food in the south.. well not sure if you would call Phoenix the south, but you get the point. 

This place is a solid 3.5 for the food experience, but when I think about round up or round down, the other touches allow me to comfortably nudge this place to a 4.

+Service was amazing. I appreciate other waiters asking do you need anything. Sometimes your server can get caught up and you are left waiting. Equally important, the server had an opinion. The worst thing is when you ask someone about an item and they shrug their shoulders.
+Food came out pretty quickly and nice and warm. I order the mix - fried chicken and a piece of catfish with greens, red potatoes and green beans, and a side of macaroni and cheese. I thought the fish was tasty, the chicken was better than okay but not great.. and the greens/green beans were just okay. I ordered the red velvet as well and well.. how can you NOT have cream cheese frosting. After letting it sit a day I liked it more.. but something was missing. 
+Mason Jars: Yes, folks, this deserved it's own line. A place totally rocks when they serve your drink in a mason jar! I loved it. If I wanted a sugar rush, I could have ordered the kool-aid. That's awesomeness.

Even with the slightly above average food experience, I would totally go back and continue to explore the menu. I will say I was a fan of their hot sauce. It has the right amount of kick to it."}
{"text":"SO great! I'd never heard of this place but a friend invited me. It's in kind of a sketchy area but inside is really nice and very clean. The entire staff was so nice from the hostess to the waitress to the manager who helped serve our food. And the food... I'm not even a fan of fried chicken but this was literally the best chicken I'd ever had and the waffles were huge and fluffy.
Lastly, the environment/ambiance was awesome. Is casual, clean, and welcoming but the theme was urban and from the hood. So the menu had tons of funny puns and they literally had a live DJ playing the background music.
Overall just a great fun little place."}
{"text":"Went 2 the original lolo's in AZ. It was recommended by my son who lived here for 3 years. Needless to say it was spectacular! The chicken was scrumptious and the waffle was tasty. I strongly recommend this spot to you all. To me it is the Roscoes of Az. One of the staff mentioned the owner of this place and the owner of Roscoe's are friends ......  I will be back!"}
{"text":"***Remember to Valet Park or park alongside Lo-Lo's and do not park in the parking area in front of the restaurant because the parking area is for Holiday Inn Express guests only! Or else, you'll get your car towed, and have to pay $125 to rescue it from impound. Okay?! ***

Anywho, I was craving fried chicken, and asked my friend S, if she wanted to lunch with me, we got to Lo-Lo's at around 12:45pm today Sunday 11/23, and were seated within a few minutes. Going back to the parking thing, I kinda chuckled thinking I nabbed the lone open spot in the lot, saw the complimentary valet by the door but the valet guy wasn't paying attention and wasn't told that was not their parking. There are signs mind you on the edge of the lot but nothing says the lot directly in front of the resto is not their parking. I regress, let's get back to the food review. It has been awhile since I've been, and it was S first time, so, we got seated at the common table by the bar area. It's nice to see how successful Lo-Lo's has become, to think they started out in a converted house in Central Phoenix, expanded out to Scottsdale, and open a new location in a free standing restaurant with so much space, a spacious open bar area with a roomy patio area, the overall feel is nice, it's airy, and neat. I like the kitschy bar chairs, and the different booths, and their staff uniforms are visually appealing. I'm also impressed with how large their menu offerings have become, and as S said it, who knew Kool Aid could look so classy served in a Mason Jar! S got the namesake dish, and I got KK's because I was going all out with the cheese and onion egg and the grits. The fried chicken was on point, neither too crispy and still retained moistness and had great flavor. Our server checked on us, and topped off our drinks. Service-wise it was great and our lunch was great. I think the afterwards left a dent in our overall experience of the new location. 

Walking out not seeing your car where you parked it is an unnerving experience in itself because from being in high spirits one moment to thinking your car was stolen the next just takes from my feelings towards Lo-Lo's. Hearing from the valet that my car was towed caught me by surprise, he was not emphatic at all but nonchalantly said it, and he sounded annoyed that I was taken aback, he proceeded to tell me, I could look up the signs for the number (of the tow company), or I could talk to the hotel manager about it since he was the one who towed all the cars (when we parked there had to be at least 10 other cars). As we were walking towards the hotel across the way, there were still people parking unawares, and the valet wasn't saying anything but this time there were others who were telling them to move their car. Long story short, hotel manager told us that they will try to mark the lot to show it's the hotel's. and Lo-Lo's actually has 15 parking spots they can use (which I guess is the valet's), so kudos they have a larger restaurant but fail on their end for having less parking than they used to when they were in the strip mall down the street. Oh, and if you enter through the back way from drinkwater blvd, there's lack of signage telling you which is Lo-Lo's parking but from the front from Earll Street there are signs. I don't know who's fault it is but for a good dining experience avoid this nuisance and headache and just valet with Lo-Lo's it's cheaper than having to pay $100+ more. I might just dine at the original location in Central Phoenix to avoid this again, what was gonna be a four-star review was marred by the parking debacle. Great place for chicken and not to park!"}
{"text":"I gave fuck zero star. They gave me said one hour but it not. They skip me line. Bec they not ask me if I need interpret. Till I ask them why we skip. They said wait for their server know sign. Wtf?!? I not for it. And not need wait. What a idiot. My kids really hungry. Fuck them"}
{"text":"Concrete Floor. That is a good thing in this type of place. The food here is very, very rich. If you are on any sort of diet, dont go! if you are not you are in luck. Nice crispy Fried Chicken and kool-aid. Thats all I got, so I can't vouch for the other items on the menu. The chicken is really good, the fried coating is light and the chicken is meaty. It's easy to skimp on Fried Chicken because you can fry any skinny ass chicken and with the right seasoning, it turns out good. You can tell they use quality chicken. The kool-aid is sweet and cold.  This place is good!"}
{"text":"I am from San Francisco Bay Area and was told that Lolo's is tasty.  As someone else mentioned, not a great part of town but surprisingly, inside the ambiance is bright and cozy.  There are TVs to watch a game and the brick walls are filled with great art and photo's.  

We had Edith as our server; she was just a doll and we had no issues with her.  

We had the Ka Ka Platter & it was yum-o.  Grits were ok but the eggs were fabulous as was the moist but not greasy chicken.  I had a Bre Bre salad and that was equally delicious.  

If you like banana's, the banana pudding is a MUST.  It is freaking good!!!!"}
{"text":"They had Kool Aid! i was so happy to see it :)

The chicken and waffles were really good... my girlfriend and I went straight there from the airport, before going to our hotel, and it was completely worth it... 

yeah, waiting outside in 100 degree heat isn't ideal, but for 10 minutes you can deal with it... especially when they had someone outside giving out water

If you're ever in Phoenix like us, or live out there, definitely stop in!!!"}
{"text":"Ac was broken so super hot and by far the worst service I have ever had....   food is awesome tho."}
{"text":"Some friends and I went to LoLos today and we're currently still here. The service started out fine with the bartender but quickly went downhill from there. We all started with waters and shortly after ordered food and drinks. The bartender never brought my Melon mojito but that wasn't the problem. 

When our appetizers came out we asked the barback if we could have utensils/napkins for our catfish beignets. The fratboy six roommate in a one bedroom girlfriend sharing barback asks the bartender if for napkins and the bartender shrugs his shoulders and says \"Nope, all out,\" and proceeds his convo with a woman sitting at the bar which he was clearly flirting with. The barback walks off to grab the silverware and when he walks back he snidely says, \"You guys need silverware for your beignets?!\" Why would you fix your face to say something like that to a customer?! Apparently he doesn't give a damn about making money and keeping customers.

He tried to redeem himself by having conversation with my friends but its too late for that. My mind was made up an hr ago. On another note I will say that the food was good and thats the ONLY reason they even got those two measely stars."}
{"text":"Been to this location and the one in Phoenix. I'll break this down into two parts.

1. Non-food
Woah, $8 for two wings and a waffle. That's expensive! Family of 4 for lunch, $50. Really?

Service was good, but not stellar. Our waitress had a bit of an attitude, but I expected that. My wife wanted greens, but... absolutely, positively, no substitutions! Cm'on guys, would it really kill you to just let us have what ever side we want if they cost the same?

Both my kids enjoyed their drumsticks, mac-n-cheese, and red beans. But, both wanted more and left hungry.

2. Food
Pretty good, but not great. The chicken is crispy and well seasoned. Maybe a hint of buttermilk in there, not sure. The waffles are just average.

Mac-n-cheese is very good. Fried okra is excellent too. Green beans, meh.

I like sweet tea, but I was not prepared for the sugar saturated version they serve. Even 1/2 sweet - 1/2 unsweet was too much for me. Kids loved the kool-aid.

Conclusion
I would love to go here more often, but they need to lower the prices and allow you to pick your side if the meal comes with one. I think LoLo's is mostly a fad, \"oh, look, Scottsdale has soul food, we are so cosmo!\" I'm from Chicago and have eaten enough soul food to know good when I have it. LoLo's is just a tad above OK."}
{"text":"Summary: chicken was dry, overcooked, lacking meat.

So I ordered 2 thighs (Lil C) with Mac-and-Cheese with a side of okra. My two chicken thighs were dry, not moist at all. I believe they were over cooked because the coating has a slight burnt flavor (not bad, but not light and crispy). And then there was the lack of meat. Must be buying skinny chickens!

On a plus side the Mac-and-Cheese was good; cheesy, rich, and done just right. The fried okra was very good too. Crispy, with a cornmeal batter, and not a hit of the okra-snots (if you like okra, you know what I'm talking about)."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time last year. Any place where you can get RED KOOL AID DRANK is okay in my book. I had the chicken and waffles, why try anything else on the first visit? Would be nice if they offered a nap room for the post meal food coma. This will knock you on your ass."}
{"text":"The dining environment and the food was great, the only thing that have to be improved is that the chicken was a little bit dry. Except for that, lolo's is pretty good!"}
{"text":"In Short: Gravy smothered awesomeness!!!

I didn't have my expectations very high once I walked in, didn't really look like a restaurant but I've heard so many good things from my friends, so had a seat.  Menu is great, there's the usual deep fried culprits and some extras.  Me and my friend went for the 3 piece chicken, I opted for the gravy smothered version.  I was blown away by the taste.  The fried chicken is very crispy, but in the inside its very moist.  Nice blend of spices all around, complements the chicken perfectly.  I'm not a big waffles fan but how could you not love that big dollop of butter siting on top.  The gravy was very delicious, and  the onions were a nice touch.  I washed all this goodness down with their signature sweet tea.  Afterward I went went home and had a nap, let's just say I was very satisfied."}
{"text":"This was my first time having chicken and waffles together and I liked the combination very much.  I had the KK which was 3 pcs of southern fried chicken (I had the breast, wing and leg), 2 waffles, grits, 2 eggs with cheese & onions.  I also wanted to try their cornbread so the wife and I ordered one to share.  Oh and got my Drank on with the \"red\".  The eggs were REALLY good with the cheese & onions.  i could eat a plate of those all day long.  The grits I didn't care for.  Lo-Lo's made the grits the way they ought to be made.  This was my first time having grits in my life (I'm 42) and I didn't care for the texture or all of the butter it comes with.  I know that's how grits are supposed to be made.  This is nothing against Lo-Lo's in this dept. at all.  I'm just not a fan of grits.  The chicken was delicious but I was hoping for a more crispy crunch to the skin but again, I would order their chicken again.  it was flavorful.  The waffle was OK.  I like my waffle crispy and with some malt or vanilla flavor to it, but when you're eating chicken and waffles, the waffle is not supposed to be gourmet.  The corm muffin was AWESOME!!!!  I could 2 or 3 of those with a plate of those cheesy onion eggs and I would be a very happy camper.  Wash that down with some red Drank and you got something going.  The only bad part about breakfast this morning was I didn't have room for their banana pudding that looked amazing,  i guess that gives me a good reason to come back.  And I will...and you should too.

P.S. The service was top notch.  I wish I got the name of the gentleman that waited on us because he was the fantastic.  He took 5 orders, sides and drinks, didn't write any of it down and got all of the orders right and kept our glasses full.  You young man were the bomb diggity."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I'm a true southern. I stopped in Lo-Lo's looking for grits. So I ordered SAKILAE'S. It is catfish and grits. Would have been a great choice, except the fact that it's not a southern portion by any means. Two very thin strips of catfish. The two together don't equal even one modest catfish filet. Don't get me wrong. It was delicious. But for the price and the small portion I should have ordered something else. The grits were good too. Cooked just right. Yet again, very small portion."}
{"text":"Damn!  Their chicken is so solid...just what Scottsdale needed was a little flavor like Lolo's.  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"We came here after arriving in Scottsdale. This is their Phoenix location, they also have one in Scottsdale. We met a family friend here who recommended this place. And we were very impressed, a nice ambience with a rustic feel and 
look. We were seated immediately and greeted
by our Waitress Brittany Ms. Queen B that's what she had on her name tag Lol. She was very friendly
and attentive, she checked on us often and kept
our drinks refilled. They have a extensive menu, lots
of choices, I wanted to try everything! I ordered a
Arnold Palmer and my Hubby got Grape Kool Aid,
yes they have Kool Aid on tap brings us back to our
Childhood, not too overly sweet like my Mama used to make, Lol. We got the Sampler plate for our Appetizer with Chicken Gizzards, Catfish Tenders
and Fried Green Tomatoes. I ordered the Fried Chicken with Collard Greens and Potatoe Salad with
Sweet Corn Bread, my Hubby got the Chicken and
Cinnamon Waffles with Grits and Eggs. We also tried the smothered Chicken Wings with Gravy. Everything was absolutely delicious, I might return
before I leave to go home. If you are out here in this
area I highly recommend you pay them a visit, you
will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles is so good. The food is flavorful, hot and prepared perfectly. I've been to lots of southern restaurants in the West but Lo Lo does it right. They don't fry their chicken or fries in old oil. The greens are tender and oh so flavorful. If you like greens with a kick, you'll find them here. The also have Kool Aid in a variety of flavors like, Grape, Red and orange. It's a little loud in there so if you're looking for a more quite ambiance, go somewhere else. The service was good, too!"}
{"text":"My P.I.C. has decided to only eat: teriyaki flavored jerkey, hot cheetos, jack in the box chicken sandwiches, and nestle ice cream cones for the rest of her pregnancy so I did not get the culinary experience I was looking forward to this trip to AZ. But we did eat here.

And the food was really good. If I didnt know any better I would say there's nothing different between roscoes chicken and Lo Lo's or the waffle which is a good thing to me. I suggest not ordering the \"breakfast potatoes' they were frozen potatoes that had been deep fried with sauteed peppers and onion thrown on top they look a lot better then they actually were. This place has one up on Roscoe's by giving unlimited refills on the kool aid. They had purple (grape), red (fruit punch), and lemonade. And they serve it in large cups like the ones you get at lucilles Bbq. 

This will become the \"usual\" the more I go to AZ."}
{"text":"Well, I can check Chicken and Waffles of my list. Do not understand what the big fuss is about. At least here at Lo-lo's. Skinny cold waffle and sub-standard chicken. Water glass was filthy. Coffee was good though."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is on point, the kook aid is good and the environment is fun. I always order the double d with waffles"}
{"text":"It was like Sunday dinner at Big Mama's house.  The chicken was perfectly fried.  I had Mac and cheese and candied yams as my sides.  The mac and cheese was some of the cheesiest I've ever tasted.  My brother had dirty rice with his chicken and fish dinner.  The dirty rice rivaled rice I've had in New Orleans.  Friendly service topped it off.  I was too full for desert, but will be sure to get some next visit."}
{"text":"REALLY loud. Food is delicious. The \"Tre Tre\" was what I ate. Servers are very courteous. (actual overall service very slow). Location clean, fun and authentic tasting. *Stay away from the Kool-Aide, it's just way too sugary!"}
{"text":"This's place is amazing!! Every time we are in Phoenix we make it a point to eat here!!! Catfish is amazing!! Of course the chicken and waffles are on point!! Greens and macaroni and cheese are amazing as well!!! Can't wait for the one in Vegas to open up!!!!"}
{"text":"BUSY! Loud, but the food it incredible. Usually a wait. It's a popular place (and location) and definitely not for your healthy meals. It is a caloric splurge but the price is right. Don't come here in a rush, you won't be in and out quickly. Service could improve. Even during lunch hours when it was slow our service wasn't great. But it's good quality food so we have been back numerous times."}
{"text":"Unbelievable! The parking is pathetic because of the hotel next door. But, I didn't expect to be ignored. After being seated, no server came by my table although they did go to the one next to me and the one across from me. After15 minutes I left. Advising the guy at the host desk that there was no service, he shrugged his shoulders and turned around and went retrieve the service and menu on my table. I guess this happens often there."}
{"text":"New location.  Good service. Classic chicken and waffles.  Had a side of collard greens that were nicely seasoned- spicy!"}
{"text":"We came to Lolo's because it was right next to our hotel. I was a fan of the kool-aid and waffles but didn't care for the fried chicken. Everyone else in our group seemed to enjoy their food as well. The service was great and fast so we came back the next day."}
{"text":"In town from North Carolina and decided to check this restaurant out. We loved everything we had(fried chicken, waffles etc.) but the red velvet cake was out of this world!"}
{"text":"I've had plenty of chicken and waffles, but lo lo's was by far the best! We had Matt as a waiter and he was so amazing, he gave us all the time we needed and our drinks were never empty!  Matt was super friendly and if I'm being 100% honest have us the BEST service I have received since I moved to Arizona! I ordered lo lo's chicken and waffles, stupid fries, and onion rings to split with my husband.. Usually we wouldn't be able to eat all the food we ordered but we couldn't stop! We ate EVERYTHING and washed it down with kool aide and sweet tea! We then came home and had our first bout of itus :) we took an hour nap and never felt better. True soul food! We're going to be coming back as regulars, hopefully we will get Matt every time!"}
{"text":"50 min waiting on chicken and waffles chicken came cold and manager didn't care she was chatting with employe and after 2nd time we call for manager still no luck and when we start walking then she came up to us 
One think this place needs new teem leader bottom line"}
{"text":"Great waffles, so-so chicken. I loved the waffles here. They were thin and dense with a great flavor.  The chicken, however, really wasn't that great. I think it was the breading the chicken was in that I didn't love.  It literally tasted like bread.  Bland bread.  That's not how I like my fried chicken.  

The lemonade was the BEST I have ever tasted.  I can see stopping in here to get waffles and lemonade.  

We ordered the KK's special or something like that. It came with 2 waffles, 3 pieces of chicken, grits and cheesy eggs. It was plenty of food for the two of us (me and my husband) and we even had a piece of chicken left over.  

Our waiter was great - even though he scared our daughter (not his fault).  She cried hysterically every time he looked at her (she's only 1).  The music was loud (but good) and the atmosphere was fun.  

We'll be back again the future.  Maybe just to try the red velvet cake. It looked SO good, but we were too stuffed to even think about getting some."}
{"text":"yumtastic!! just don't forget your safety whistle and pepper spray! ....even during the day...."}
{"text":"Wow, that was really good! Super exhaustive menu of everything you could even want to enjoy. Really good quality food and awesome staff. Can't go too often if you want to keep slim, but very much worth it for the occasional splurge. YUM"}
{"text":"The neighborhood?  Shady.  The building?  Super old.  The food? Unhealthy.  But you know what, its worth every penny.  Outstanding comfort food spot.  I've gotten the Lo-Lo's with a jar of blue drank everytime.  Its a caloric nightmare, but its absolutely awesome.  Sweet waffles and syrup mixed with great fried chicken truly is where its at.  This place draws people from all walks of life.  If you want to try a downtown institution for breakfast and (like me) aren't counting calories, you can't go wrong here"}
{"text":"We (party of 2) came in on a Tuesday at 5:30pm. No line and was seated promptly. We waited so long that we had to ask a server from a different table to take our drink order at least. Another 15 min or so passed and no drink was brought out, still haven't met our server to take the entree order. Gave them another 5 mins before we got up and left. Sorry, won't be returning to this location. 
Time well wasted."}
{"text":"My friends and I were in Scottsdale for spring training and stopped here for our last meal before we headed back to the Bay. OMG! We LOVED this place! From the moment we walked in, we couldn't get over how awesome this place was. The menu is freakin hilarious! Where else can you find a \"Phat Azz Chicken Samich\", \"Stupid Fries\", and a \"DVZ's Hot Ghetto Mess\"?! We spent a good amount of time just going over the menu, telling each other what we think they should get, just because it sounded so funny.  The SUPER nice servers could tell how much we loved the menu and let us take one home as a souvenir. 

I ended up getting the Baby Ray and 2 of my friends got the Lo-Lo's.  I can honestly say this is the best fried chicken I've ever had. Better than Roscoe's in LA and better than Front Porch in SF. It was juicy and full of flavor. Unlike Roscoe's which I found to be a little on the dry side.  My friend also got a cornbread which was really good too. The portions were HUGE. I think between us 3 girls, we could have just shared two dishes and would still have some left over. 

If you are in the area, you should totally check this place out. My friends and I are already talking about going back to AZ for spring training next year, and this is definitely one of the spots we are coming back to!"}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! First time having chicken and waffles during the same meal. The waffles are super uber mouthwatering delicious. Waffles are crunchy and soft all in one. The chicken was crispy and very flavorful just how I like it! Not only was the experience amazing, but the atmosphere was great. Great music playing but also not too loud, which was great for my brunch date and I. Not only was all this amazing but also had valet parking. So many thumbs up for this place!"}
{"text":"Easter Sunday at 11am and we were prepared to wait quite a while. The host gave us an estimated time of 15 minutes and we were seated in less than 5. Our server (Matthew)  greeted us immediately and took our drink orders. We were served our meals within 10 minutes of placing our orders......so fast I almost got whiplash!

I had the Betty Boob (fried chicken breast) and waffle, my daughter had the drumstick, a thigh, and a waffle. I'm not a huge waffle fan, but the waffle was crisp on the outside, tender on the inside, with a hint of cinnamon. My daughter stated the waffles weren't as good as Roscoes, but they were a close second.   The chicken was fried to perfection!!

We ordered a few sides to share (okra was delicious, mac and cheese average). The sweet tea was sweeter than the syrup for the waffles, but if you like your tea sweet, it came in a huge mason jar for $3.  

The service was excellent, great value for your money ($27 inc tax) for two huge meals with beverages, the restaurant was clean, food was good...can't ask for much more!"}
{"text":"We LOVE LoLo's!!!! So happy to see how much they have grown and expanded and absolutely loved by others. The Betty's boob is my fave with pecans in the waffle. And my husband loves the fried catfish and swares that the collard greens have healing powers for breakfast."}
{"text":"I used to like going to LoLo's however, since they have expanded.  And gotten All Big Time.  They Service has gone DOWN Hill.  The wait time, is horrible.... up to and hour.  The chicken, no longer has \"ANY\" flavor.  The Service,  just isn't the same.  And the Owner, doesn't appear to give a Shit anymore.  Hey, We the people used to just Rave about LoLo's.  However lately..... going to have to find another place.  The Cental Location.... Im DONE with.  However, I did go the the new Scottsdale location.. The service was alittle better.  However, the Food.... was just BLAND..... Come On.....Get back to, Why your customers, came to you in the first place......The FOOD.... !!! If the food is no longer any good.   Why waste my time WAITING.... and WAITING.... and WAITING.... for Cold, Unseasoned, Blah Food?  Will not be going back..... Ive downgraded, Lo Lo's from 5 star to One Star, until I see improvement.  Will NOT be going back, and have let ALL my people Know as well.  We've  ALL had the same, experience lately.... ijs......"}
{"text":"The food is great but the service is god awful. I've tried to allow them to redeem themselves multiple times. I've gone with friends who got their food, ate their food, and eventually paid for their meal while mine was still cooking. I've ordered food to go to avoid the customer service. They told me it would take 20 minutes. I ended up waiting an hour and my order was still wrong and because I paid over the phone, they said they couldn't issue a refund. I told the hostess to have the manager call me since they weren't available. No one called and I never got my money or correct food. It's to the point to not only will I ever give my money to Lo-Lo's again, I want to warn everyone else who plans to give them money as well. 


If all you care about is the quality of food and not necessarily the accuracy of it matching up to what you actually ordered OR if you don't care about being treated like crap, then enjoy !"}
{"text":"The best fried chicken and waffles ever!  I think subconsciously you feel less guilty if you order the fried chicken breast but it was awesome.  We all split sides of mac n cheese and collard greens.  Friendly, attentive staff.  Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"It was very good.

Chicken was tasty but a bit overcooked.

Waffles were phenomenal with a hint of cinnamon.

Mac and cheese was perfect along with the home-style fries.

I liked the fact they used mason jars for glasses. That is something I do at home also. 

I am still wondering why people are putting up pictures of another location.  Check out my recent upload for what it really looks like outside. It is a tad scary but that just makes me want to investigate even further. 

I expected it to be cheaper than it was. Oh well!"}
{"text":"Glad we made the choice to come here.  The food was good.  Portions very generous.  Very reasonably priced.   Would have cost double in LA.  If you're not a big eater, you could definitely share a plate.  I rounded up the stars for the service.  Queen B was .   Service is everything.  Wasn't too happy when a family came in with their service dog.  (He was with the trainer, not actually assisting anyone). They could have at least asked if we minded.  My friend is terrified of dogs as she was bit by one. Luckily we were packing our leftovers to go.  Definitely stop by if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Let's play a little word association. I'm going to mention two words to you and you gage your reaction.

Chicken and waffles.

Was your reaction \"ew?\" If so, go ahead and skip this review and go wait for a table at Chili's because Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles is not for you.

If your reaction was \"Oh HELLLL Yeah!\" then head on over the South Phoenix for some of the best soul food Phoenix has to offer. 

Definitely not health conscious food, but if you are gonna cheat on your diet, Lo-Lo's would be the place to do it. The fried chicken is crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. The sides are tasty and plentiful. The waffles are out of this world. By far the best waffles I've ever had. The red velvet cake is dense and moist."}
{"text":"My family and I were looking for great fried chicken restaurant. We found this place on yelp, and now we understand all the good reviews about it. This place is amazing. Best fried chicken I've had ever. Bruce, our waitor was very attentive and friendly. I'm a big biscuit fan, and Lolo ' s biscuits were the best. I also want to say that the corn bread should not be ignored, as it is good too. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food is classic LoLo's. This new place is bigger and much noisier than the last. The decorations and expanded menu is nice but those new chairs are very uncomfortable.  I felt like I was sitting at my kids elementary school.  Some look like they would break easily. This is a place to eat and run.  It is definitely not a place to meet and hang with people."}
{"text":"Save your money and time and don't come to this location. 1+ hour wait time on three pieces of chicken and a waffle. Server refused any type of compensation and was argumentative when questioned about charging full price for a horrible experience. Management had no presence. I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to try lolos chicken and waffles this past sunday! I have mixed feelings about this place. 

1. The chicken and waffles were yummy! 

2. The wait when ordering a burger is ridiculous.  We waited about 40 minutes for our food to come out just because my husband ordered a burger.

3. We spend $11 on dessert to go (red velvet & banana pudding), both were extremely dry. The pictures totally gave us false hope. I seriously think the desserts were a week old at least. 

4. The mac and cheese was okay, nothing special. 

I would return but it's not a place I would go out of my way for.

P.s ~ be prepared to wait 30-40 minutes for a table on a sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"I'm giving Lo-Lo's a lot of leeway, because I've been a fan of them for a while. However I think the service has gone downhill since moving locations. Also I think they've tried to create more of a trendy club-like atmosphere instead of a homey place. I really don't like that they have a DJ. It's often too loud to have a decent conversation. The food is still great. Their chicken and waffles are unrivaled and their fried catfish is a treat. I also recommend the cornbread. It is massive and easily shared."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing. Great service and good food. Make sure you sit in Matthew's section. He provided great service, very attentive and provides good menu selections. You definitely have to get a bottle of hot sauce to go. The fried chicken was flavorful and finger looking good. Trio appetizers was a great way to begin. We had gizzards,catfish beignets and fried tomatoes. The bottle less mimosa were just right."}
{"text":"As a former Atlanta resident and a forever lover of the South and all its delicious food, racist people and humid weather it has to offer- it was my absolute pleasure to bring my friend to his first ever Chicken & Waffle meal.

Although the Scottsdale location is closer to my house, I insisted on my 25min drive to downtown Phoenix to eat at this Lolos because I refused to eat C&W at a place surrounded by floppy hats, leftover nightclub makeup and eating disorders. I wanted Southern-ghetto-fabulous and damnit,  I got it. And even though we showed up at 1 for brunch, we were still faced with a line literally out the door and almost around the block... yet we still put our name down and waited. The place is quite big so even with a large wait list our wait was still only 20mins- not too terrible. As we waited outside and got closer to the entrance, we kept admiring the people that came out with their to-go box, holding their stomachs and making jokes about being so full that they'll roll down the hill. \"Thats what I want to be like!\" I cried, super giddy with excitement. 

We got seated soon enough and we already knew what we wanted (obviously we spent our time outside planning out our meal). Between the two of us we ordered: Chicken and waffles (duh), Fried & smothered pork chops with mac and cheese, green beans and corn bread, fried green tomato appetizer and a giant mason jar of purple kool aid.

As our feast arrived, I could feel my heart beating faster and my arteries clogging up. This was going to be a challenge worth fighting for. We started with the C&W and each put a half-waffle and half-chicken on our plate. My friend starts eating the chicken and I immediately go in a panic. \"What are you doing! No! That's not how you eat it!\". After giving him a long and passionate sermon, I bring a random server to our table to reinforce my lecture about the correct way of eating C+W. The server agrees:

************You grab your waffle. Add a layer of honey/syrup on top of every square of your waffle. You place your chicken ON TOP (either cut-up or whole). You cover the chicken with hot sauce. You grab your knife and fork (OR fold the waffle like a taco) and YOU EAT A BITE OF EVERYTHING AT ONCE************ 

As he took his first bite I swear I saw unicorns and rainbows come out of his eyes. He finally got it. The sweet, salty, spicy, crunchy, soft, fried goodness that is a well-executed C+W. Its sweaty redneck sex on a plate. Its fucking good.

After that, you could've given us a flaccid french fry and we would have still called it a successful meal. The cornbread was amazing, the mac and cheese was tasty and the pork chop was the size of an overweight chihuahua. The only thing not worth ordering was the damn fried green tomatoes: only 4 slices for $7, completely covered in salt, with a side of salt and some extra salt to go with it. Half-way through the meal we found ourselves surrounded by 3 servers and the chef, all gathered to answer the \"what are gizzards made of?\" question- all because they were afraid that we would be grossed out by the definition. We were all cracking jokes and enjoying their company.

As we were down to 1 fried green tomato and half a porkchop left, we started breathing heavily. \"I don't think I can eat any more\" said one person. \"WE MUST FINISH THIS\" said, well, me. Using every bone in my body to be able to eat the last couple bites, we took the nasty green tomatoes in a box and called the whole thing a victory. As soon as we sat in my car and turned the car on I grabbed my stomach and said \"I'm sorry, I need to do this\"- *takes off belt. \"OOOHHHH GOD. MUCHH BETTER\". I regret nothing."}
{"text":"I would of given Lo Lo's a 5 if we didn't have to wait so long to receive our food.  

I was in Phoenix for the weekend so my cousins took me to Lo Lo's for some chicken and waffles for an early dinner on Sunday.  The place was packed and very busy so I knew it had to be something special about the food.  After waiting about 20 minutes to be seated I ordered the $14 special with 3 pieces of chicken a side red beans, and rice and gravy.  I also ordered what I think was a blue berry lemonade....lets just say it was a blue drink :).  It was in a huge glass mason jar and was super sweet.  I liked it but I had to add a couple slices of lemon to tarten it up and some water to smooth out all that sugar.

The food was hot and fresh and tasted great.

Over all the place was nice and clean and the decor was nice.  The waiters although super busy was nice and efficient.

When I visit Phoenix I will definitely revisit Lo Lo's....I have to get some of the catfish that my cousin had on her plate that I kept pinching off of lol.

Lo lo's closes early on Sunday so get there by 3:30 because you can't get in after 3:59 on Sundays."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed. I have been here before and had amazing service and great food. This time wait time after we order it was 45 mins until we got our food. We weren't going to say anything until 3 tables that came as long as 20 mins after us were getting their food already. We brought it to the managers attention and he let us know our order was placed 10 mins ago. It was pretty upsetting to hear that we sat over 30 mins until our order was put it. He took care of most of our meal which was great and the food was good and hot but lost our appetite by the time the food came out."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express next door for the weekend and every time me we walked outside our hotel, we were hit with the LoLo's aroma of maple syrup in the air. After 3 days of resisting we decided to check it out on a Sunday morning about 9:30. We got seated right away as there were several open tables. However, after being seated the waitress took a while to get our drinks and then another bit to take our order. From this point on we sat, and we sat, and we sat waiting for our food. We looked around at the restaurant that had filled up and every other table was sitting waiting with no food on their table either.

At just near the HOUR mark, our waitress arrived with our food. I don't understand how a restaurant that only focuses on 2 items (chicken & waffles) can take an hour to complete a simple order of just those 2 items. 

The food looked good when it arrived. Pretty standard fried chicken that was a tad greasy and a waffle that was quite soggy on the first bite. 

I doubt we'll ever head back to LoLo's and I'd be surprised if they last until next year given the efficiency of the kitchen staff."}
{"text":"When you're talking chicken & waffle places, no matter what, it'll always have to stack up against Roscoe's. It may not be fair, but that's how it's gotta be. I've also been to chicken & waffle places up and down the west coast, so I know what I'm talking about here. In the end, nothing quite stacks up to the OG, Roscoe.

Still, doesn't mean that Lo-Lo can't throw in a contender. And quite a contender it is. His sendup of the classic most definitely works for me. Fluffy waffle, and tender fried chicken doused in Louisiana-style hot sauce. That's what I'm talking about. Can't forget the mac & cheese either, which was a very healthy portion. 

The food is good, but what won me over? Lemonade. Unlike Roscoe's, Lo-Lo's will refill your lemonade. Can't go wrong with that. Service was fantastic, and even with a half-hour wait on a Friday night, everyone was still pleasant and happy. Just wish I wasn't so full to try that red velvet cake.

No one will ever step to Roscoe, but Lo-Lo and Sandra Dee in Sacramento are more than qualified contenders to the title."}
{"text":"After having a previous wonderful experience here, this experience ruined that and makes me not want to return. After waiting over an hour for food (while every table around us was quickly seated and fed) we finally asked to speak to a manager since our waitress hadn't come back in at least 30 minutes. The manager came out just long enough to see which table we were and then disappeared into the back. Our food came out immediately after, but the chicken was overcooked, the eggs were overcooked, and the portion for their $4 okra side was TINY (maybe ten pieces).  When we asked our waitress what happened she had no apologies only excuses, and the manager never came out to apologize either. In the end they did give us a slight discount but it didn't even cover one of the meals we waited so long for. I thought this was going to be a place we would frequent, but this experience definitely changed my mind."}
{"text":"LO LO's has the best DAMN CHICKEN in AZ! The people are always really nice. This is a place that as a local I tell people to go for fried chicken.  A+++++"}
{"text":"Good southern-style food. The portions are really too large for one meal, especially since it's located in an airport, and most people can't take leftovers home. 
I had the catfish and okra. Everything was excellent!"}
{"text":"Wow. I could stop my review right there and that would say it all (about the food). We've had chicken and waffles at the famed Roscoes and LoLo's is far superior. The chicken was flavorful and juicy. The waffles (and I'm not a huge waffle fan) were melt in your mouth good. I had the #10 (2 legs and waffle), kiddos split a breakfast plate (cheesy eggs and a waffle). Husband had the stupid fries. Upon reading the description for the stupid fries I said \"that sounds disgusting\" well, I was wrong. Took it back a few years and had some kool-aid (which was SUPER sugary - I never noticed that as a kid!). 

When we entered the place was packed (it was a week day night) and we had a 5 min wait). Our server, Bre, seemed stretched thin but she did a good job of keeping up. It is pretty loud in here, which worked well for our kids. We did see one family get up and leave because they had not been helped in a timely fashion. Just be prepared for it to be busy and to be a bit patient. It is worth it!

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I'd probably pass, nowhere near as good as other Lo Los in the area.  Damp waffle, overly salty chicken."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken and waffles, SUPERB STAFF.

The food and drinks are great but the staff really made our night in Arizona. They were all extremely friendly, helpful and provided us a lot of advice on what to eat and do around the area. I'm usually not a chicken and waffles person but this was delicious. The waffles were fluffy and chicken was tender and crispy. The banana bread pudding was also amazing. We weren't gonna get it because we were too full but Wes, the manager, brought it out for us anyway and it tasted heavenly.

Wish we had a cool chicken and waffles joint like this in Philly!"}
{"text":"I heard all the hype about this place from a few co workers and customers and I thought I'd give it a shot! I decided to go down to the main location in downtown phx. As I walked in, it was pretty crowded and everyone looked like they were having a great time! The lady greeted my girlfriend and I and told us the wait was around 10 minutes. So roughly around 23 minutes later we were finally seated. ( I was totally fine waiting the extra minutes and was in no rush). 

We sat there for about another 15 minutes before our server greeted us and asked what we wanted to drink by then we knew to order everything right away because we could tell it was going to take awhile for our waiter to come back. So my girlfriend and I ordered sweet tea and the basic chicken and waffles. The food took around 20-25 minutes to come out and I was already on my 3rd sweet tea. The food turned out to be pretty decent even though I was expecting more. My waffles were a little burnt along with my chicken. I was disappointed in my meal. My girlfriends meal was perfectly cooked. I couldn't finish my meal and it was a little too sweet for me. 

As of now my review of this place stands at a 3 stars due to the service and the food. I plan on coming back soon and giving this place another shot! It has great potential."}
{"text":"Not worth your time nor money. A group of friends and I went to lunch at the one in Scottsdale. It took almost 2 hours to get our food and when we requested to speak with the manager Shavonda she REFUSED to come speak with us. The waiter went and asked her to come out several times but she refused. We were not the only ones that had this experience. Other customer were upset and asked to speak with a manager and she refused to come out. It seems that Lolo's success has went to their heads after speaking with some people and they no longer care about their customer nor providing good service. You can get a better meal and service someone else."}
{"text":"We have been here a handful of times for lunch since we work nearby.  Each time we go the worse the service gets.  Today a friend and I both ordered a leg and thigh with a side.  We both got two legs.  Not a big deal really.  We told the staff and they promptly brought us each a thigh piece.  Then they said they have to take a leg piece away.  She had a glove on took a leg piece off each of our plates and then proceeded to throw them in the garbage directly behind us.  That was the most odd experience and poor customer service I have ever seen."}
{"text":"There isn't anything bad that I can say about this Lo Lo's from the fantabulous staff to the delicious food!!! This was our first stop from the airport and we were not disappointed at all!! The chicken was very crunchy and savory! The Mac and cheese was very cheesy and my husband LOVED his grits and of course the chicken!!! Thank you so much Mrs. Cheryl and Karla!!!! You guys started our anniversary weekend off perfect!! We will definitely be back for more!!!! Wayne and Nichole from Fort Worth, Tx

P. S.
Can't wait until you guys open in Texas!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I used to visit the old location regularly when I worked in Tempe. Now, after a 2+ year absence, I'm back in Tempe, and figured I had to give the new location a shot.

The valet parking captures the whole experience without your ever having to set foot in the door. Valet parking at a soul food restaurant? It's a contradiction.

Basically, they Scottsdalified what used to be a welcoming, soulful restaurant with good food and friendly, spunky service. It used to take me minutes to get my food even when the place was packed; now it took forever with a half-empty restaurant. The staff? No charm whatsoever. It's just the same cold, stale trendy restaurant you expect anywhere else in Scottsdale.

And the food isn't even as good anymore.

Thanks for ruining a good thing, Lo Lo's."}
{"text":"Chickennnnn! I love soul food! I was staying at a hotel in North Phoenix, but drove 20 minutes downtown to try this place!

I got the \"Baby Ray\" which was 3 pieces of chicken smothered with gravy and onions, and 2 waffles. Mmmmm, I'm drooling just thinking about it. I really loved the gravy, it tasted great with the chicken. The food came out fast despite how crowded it was! The service was friendly."}
{"text":"When the owner's on-site, this place is amazing and fun!  However, when she's not there, the story changes.  Last time there my waffle was soggy and the chicken was cold in the middle.  I finally got the waitress over and sent the plate back.  Out came another plate.  This time the chicken was worse.  Cold to the touch.  I'm not kidding.  The tip of one chicken wing was still frozen!  I have not been back since. . . .   Good luck trying this place.  It really is nice as long as the owner's got her eye on things."}
{"text":"First time at Lolo's Chicken and Waffles. Absolutely not my last!

I arrived at 6 on a Tuesday night and it was very busy. Got my table and scanned the huge menu. Settled on the server's recommendation: the Soulfood Platter. It came with several options so I chose three pieces of fried chicken, cornbread and two sides (I chose Mac N Cheese plus Collard Greens)  I added an iced tea for a total of $20.04 plus tip. 

My dinner arrived in about 8-10 mins. The pressure-cooked chicken was hot, crispy, juicy, seasoned well and cooked perfectly. The cornbread was okay. The corn kernels added a nice touch but honey would've made it better. The Mac was okay. It needed toasted bread crumbs for finish. Nice and creamy tho. Never had collard greens before-they were excellent. Kinda like if spinach and cabbage had a baby. They add bacon and red pepper flakes here (not much tho), so it had a good smoky flavor. 

The service was exceptional and I had no qualms over any part of the meal. 

I highly recommend Lolo's for a filling, tasty southern  dinner!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Lo-Lo's since I started working in Downtown back in  '07.  The food quality has been consistent throughout the years, and I really like what they've done with the remodel.  They offer breakfast menu items now also.  Parking can get pretty rough during peak hours, but they usually have valet working when it happens."}
{"text":"I would definitely not go here again. Service was very slow. We were not greeted we were not seated we were allowed to walk around and no one tried to stop it. We set ourselves took a long time to get service. The manager was more interested in speaking and screwing around with her employees than taking care of the customers. Then on top of that I found out that they added tip by changing my writing to my final bill."}
{"text":"Love the upgrade over the other place! Slammin fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Great for airport food, but not quite up to the regular Lo-lo's standard."}
{"text":"I think the forced valet parking (or off site) is a mismatch for Lo-Lo's - maybe it's driven by the Holiday Inn sharing the parking lot, but it really doesn't work for me.  It's also hard to get to from the north.  It still tastes, great, but...the chicken legs were smaller than before they moved...all in all, I miss the old location - they've lost some of it's 'hole in the wall' charm.  Hope the 'upscaling' works for them!"}
{"text":"I'm just gonna go ahead and say that this place is better than Roscoe's Chicken n Waffles. May not mean much to folks who've never been there but just know you're missing anything there. 
Lo-Lo's is the new spot!! Food was great!!! Atmosphere was amazing, staff, music etc... 
We got chicken n waffles, biscuits n gravy, grits, house potatoes and the French toast plate. All of the food was really good and flavorful. Sweet tea and kool-aid?!?!!!! Yum! And then you got the tv's so you can watch the games!! This place is a win on all fronts"}
{"text":"Chicken, dry. Even the dark meat. Our waitress Althea, was rude. Apparently going to work was our fault and we were punished for it. Attitude from the start, we were a burden. Table next to us was bothered by her attitude as well. Anyway, came here for my girlfriend's birthday. Over priced. Had to ask the other waitress for a refills. When she informed our waitress that we needed something, the waitress came and told us how to ask for help, she walked past us 3 times before hand with empty glasses placed at the end of the table and never checked in with us. There were 6 people standing at the hostess stand, and I had to get one of their attention to even be acknowledged about our call ahead. Horrible experience. Besides the other waitress that helped us, no good. We will not be back at this location ever. Customer service, awful. You only get 2 stars because of the waitress that helped us actually get a refill."}
{"text":"Hostess Great, Waitress Great, Big Black lady that slapped the food down and stated \"I guess this. Is yours, Shameful\""}
{"text":"Fantastic fried chicken. Such great prices for such great food. You have to try the mac n' cheese & collard greens. Also, the portions are very generous. I don't live in Arizona, but I will definitely come back here when I visit again. Build one in LA please!!!"}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's is a nice experience in southern cooking without leaving Phoenix. You can see why everyone raves about the place.

Three of us came here for breakfast last week and really enjoyed ourselves.  The only drawback was that we arrived at 8:15am. Yelp had the opening listed incorrectly as 7 am.  Lo-Lo's  OPENS AT 9 AM! I have posted a updated photo, with the correct times from the front door.

We ordered two coffees and a iced \"fruit punch\" Kool-Aid for $3.00 each to start. I had the #8 Betty Boop for $8.00. It comes with one piece of southern fried chicken breast, along with a plate covering waffle. It wasn't bad, but mine was a little mushy and didn't stand up well to the syrup. 

As for the chicken, I regret that it was somewhat dry and not juicy. The smashed sides of two sausage paddies for $2.00 was great and it had a nice flavor.  I would come back just for the smashed sausages and Kool-Aid anytime!

My two friends ordered the #14 CJ's, which is one waffle, one egg, and a small bowl of grits for only $6.00 (a steal); and the #11 Kimbo for $7.00, which is two giant waffles. My friend reported that his waffles were cooked longer and they looked golden brown. 

Spending some time in the south, I really miss having Grits. Oatmeal is not the same thing. The Grits at Lo-Lo's are very good. If you have never tried them before, Lo-Lo's would be a good introduction. But skip the cheese on top. The best I've ever enjoyed came with small pieces of bacon in it. Yum! Now, which way is the Mayo Clinic? LOL

Our bill for three including taxes, but before gratuities ran us $34.86. Overall the food and service was very good. I would say Three and Half Stars good, rounding up to Four."}
{"text":"I have a confession: I thought the concept of chicken and waffles was kinda ridiculous -- I mean, that's a lot of unhealthy beige and brown grub on one plate. My second confession is that last Saturday was the first time I indulged in CW and it was on vacation, at Lolo's. Holy banana pants!!! I have been missing out!

The chicken was fresh, hot, crispy, tender - the batter is epic. And the waffle was thin, crunch crunch, almost with a hint of cinnamon, bathed in butter and syrup -- oh-hohoho! LOVE. 

The missing star is due to the macaroni and cheese, disastrous velvety glop. Meh."}
{"text":"The food is really good. Everything  I have ordered is expertly made. Just like mom used to make. The biggest drawback is the parking. They do have complimentary valet parking, to make up for it. However, once you come inside and the smell hits you....you forget all about it. The huge mason jars of kool-aid or sweet tea is the best. They do have a bar and TVs so you can watch while you wait for your food. Try the red velvet pancakes.
Get the Stupid Fries to go. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in Los Angeles, where it's the talk of the town for being the best in its speciality. For you locals that wish you could try it...

...go to Lolo's instead. 

This isn't hometown bias, either! Hands down, I prefer Lolo's. The chicken is cooked to crispy perfection and the waffles are fluffy yet flat and soft yet crunchy, all with a slight hint of cinnamon. I never go here without ordering a huge mason jar full of Kool-Aid. The sense of family in this newly-renovated building is great; I always feel right at home. Their Mac-n-cheese is great, too! Sometimes you can catch them making their food in the front window where they have all their ingredients and kitchen tools out for display. 

I promise you won't be disappointed. You'll leave with a super full stomach and a smile on your face."}
{"text":"I went to Lo-Lo's for the first time it was a recommendation and I had the dish Phat Boy it was delicious the place was busy when I went and the service was good :)"}
{"text":"First time at this LoLo's. I arrived at 11:30 on a Friday morning and it was half full. Parking can be a trick since the hotel next door takes many of the spots. 

I was greeted right away by Richard and he brought my drink and took my order with efficiency. I ordered the Lil Amadi, (two pieces of dark meat plus a waffle) plus a side of collard greens and an iced tea. It came to $12.95. 

The chicken was over cooked but not too far. I added some of their 'award winning Hot sauce', which is Frank's, and it was fine.  The waffle was very lightly cooked (I like it that way), fluffy, with a hint of cinnamon. The greens were okay but lacked the smoke flavor that I've gotten at the other store. The drinks were huge, served in a mason jar. Kool Aid is always available. 

Unfortunately, as I was finishing my meal, I noticed my plate had some hardened egg from a previous diner on it. I pointed it out to Richard, who said 'sorry', then brought my full bill. 

Probably no return visit in the future."}
{"text":"Front desk hostess sat me down never told a waiter I sat there for 15min no drink just a menu. Oh I'm on the patio by the way, so when I go inside I ask if they just didn't see me outside. The looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language. I decided to just leave not worth the headache and won't be back. If I could give them no stars I would. Thank God for Mrs. Whites's the original."}
{"text":"My first time trying chicken and waffles, let's see what the hype is about. First of all my big mistake was going there on a Sunday, Palm Sunday to be exact. We were told there would be a 30 min wait, which I was surprised due to the amount of people that were already waiting. So we waited and waited and waited. Well 30 min wait turned into an hour wait. 

We finally got a place to sit and waited for someone to acknowledge us. Finally we got to put in our drink orders! The drinks came in big mason jars and I ended up ordering sweet tea ($3), which was so incredibly sweet that I couldn't really drink it. 

My husband ordered KK which consisted of 3 piece chicken, 2 waffles, grits, and eggs with cheese and onions. I ordered Baby Ray which came with 3 piece chicken with gravy and 2 waffles. We also ordered side of collard greens.

We then waited and waited and waited for our food which took about 50 mins! The waitress never once came over to see how we were doing or even informed us about our food. The kitchen looked like there was no sense of order and it was chaotic behind the counter. 

So now on to the food. The chicken with gravy and the collards were the only things that were actually delicious. The waffles were soft and dense, it was more like a pancake shaped like waffles. The grits were cold and congealed, I'm assuming it would've been good if it was hot because the flavors were decent. 

Basically we waited an hour for the table, hour for the food, and ate in 15 minutes. I'm not sure if I would return to give it another try but if I did, I would go on a weekday."}
{"text":"A dear old friend told us about this place last year after she was here during Spring Training.  She fed the brother some cold, day-old Lo-Lo's chicken and he thought it was good.  When I was in Scottsdale shortly after that, I just didn't have a chance to stop although I did see it as other friends drove me back to my hotel.  It made me sad.

So on the road trip through some southwestern and southern states, this was put down as a stop.  It was so worth it!  I shared the #1 KKs with the nieces - 3 pieces of chicken southern style, 2 waffles, grits & 2 eggs scrambled with cheese & onions.  There was so much food!  The chicken skin was so crispy, and the meat was juicy and tender.  Waffles were yummy.  We also got to sample the smothered chicken, Cool Bre Bre's Chicken Salad, red beans over rice and collard greens from the rest of the table. 

And we had to have the Stupid Fries.  With a name like that, how could we not order it?!?  Oh my, were those hot seasoned fries topped with tender fried white meat chicken, gravy & onions, green & red peppers covered with cheese good.  

WARNING - the drinks were HUGE!  And some of it was on the sweet side.  Both nieces had Kool Aid.  One was just right and the other was super sweet.  The latter must've been the one they call Red Kool Aid \"Drank\".  No matter.   We asked our waiter, Michael, for water and fixed it to our taste.  My lemonade was good but perfect after I watered it down also.  

Lo-Lo's is definitely better than Roscoe's!"}
{"text":"Amazing soul food! I've been craving Sweet Tea since my internship in North Carolina last summer, and Lolo's definitely hit the spot. I ordered two chicken breasts and the waffles (the toy-toy), but everything our group got looked scrumptious. The macaroni and cheese is especially delicious!

What are you waiting? Head to Lolos for southern style soul food :)"}
{"text":"3rd stike..... I will never return to this location. 

This is the third and final time I will set foot in this location. Todays encounter was by far the worst. My mother called in a to go order because she figured it would be busy. When my son arrived we stood at the door as there were several people waiting to be seated. I received a text from my mother informing me that it would be an hour for the order to be ready. I looked around and there were several empty tables in the middle of the room, 2 empty booths along the window and the banquest room was empty. I approached the counter and asked the hostess if it was really going to take an hour to get a to go? She replied yes, we have people sitting at tables that havent had their orders filled in 30 mins or more. i directed her sight to the multiple open tables and asked for an explanation. She said \"OBVIOUSLY WE'RE BUSY\"!! I then asked to speak with the manager, whom happened to be walking up. I stepped to the side to address the manager. I informed the manager that this was my 3rd attempt at getting a to go order. I explained that my family and I go to the Scottsdale location very often. From the start the manager was very condescending. I informed him of my most recent visit to simply get dessert,(Which on that visit I was informed that they were'nt doing to go orders because it slows down the kitchen. But they would see if they could get me a slice of cake)! After explaining my frustration to the manager his reply was simply \"oh well\", while staring blankly into my face. I asked the manager for his name which he gladly offered while extending his hand, \"I'M LARRY WHITE, THE OWNER... I AM LoLo!' Raising his voice and gripping my hand as if to intimidate me! I shook his hand as he squeezed like we were at some stand off in the playground, childish attempt to display authority! I politely informed Mr. White that there was no need to attempt aggression and raise his voice. I reminded him that I was calm and the tone in my voice had not changed AND I would appreciate it if he would not attempt to disrespect me in front of my 4yr old by raising his voice to me. I thanked Mr. White and requested that he cancel my mothers to go order request. 
As mentioned, my family and I are loyal patrons of the Scottsdale location. It is really sad that the level of service is not the same. But here is a suggestion, maybe if your kitchen staff cannot handle the level of business that you do, HIRE MORE STAFF!!! Or better yet, turn down the music and have the DJ help out! It's a restaurant not a night club. But I am not a Business Major so maybe I don't know from what I speak."}
{"text":"2nd chance....
Chicken good, decor good, grits good.
Had the koolaid before so I choose water this time.
Catfish and cornbread had a too moist/wetness to it, so much I could not finish it. Food took a long time to come out and when it did they told us to enjoy but never gave us silverware to do so. Waiter was kinda short with us. Midway through the meal realized there was a dead bug dining with us. Although the prices were fair I just rather not return."}
{"text":"Service is sooooo slow! Food is ok, I'm not sure if it lives up to the hype. I'm not sure if we will try it again or not."}
{"text":"Finally made my way to the new Lolo's in Scottsdale. Live close by and really haven't heard of it until about a month ago when I was renting a video at Blockbuster. 
Decided to go fairly late Saturday before they closed and at about 2pm the place was pretty packed. Was given a choice to sit at the bar which wasn't a problem. Impressed by the transformation as this location used to have a Tokyo Express which I would go to at least once a week. I was joined at the bar by 3 other people and given menus. Only issues I have with my whole meal is that they should have decided the bar so that people can put their legs underneath because the meal required a bit of gymnastics to fit comfortably. Other issue, but one I can forgive is that the 3 people next to me were asked what they wanted to drink, Koolaid, and somehow I became temporarily invisible and wasn't. Took about 5 minutes for anyone to bother to ask. I can't blame though because the place was busy and I who doesn't want a new place to be successful when the food and atmosphere are good.
Ordered the Betty Boop (chicken and waffle, and so did the 3 other people next to me...I have that effect on people). Chicken breast and waffle were delicious and I definitely had a sugar high from the 2 gallons of Koolaid that were served to me. I'll make a note to maybe go for some Diet Coke next time. Definitely recommend the place and hope to check it out with my family or a group of friends to have better seating."}
{"text":"The service we received  here was incredible, our order came out in like 2 minutes, but didn't seem to have been sitting out at all. The chicken was amazing, and the waffles were delicious. Love the mason jar drinks, and all the signatures on the walls"}
{"text":"I have to admit that I have a love-hate relationship with Lo-Lo's.  The chicken is incredible, the waffles are okay, but the service always drives me nuts!  I'm okay with the sticky menus, the soggy mac and cheese can be overlooked as well, but don't disrespect me or make us wait 30 minutes for a plate of chicken.  

If you're not in a hurry, you will probably love this place, but be prepared for some southern style mosy-like service.  

Here are some tips worth the read:  the chicken is great, but if you really want to taste some soul food, you've got to get the dark meat and collard greens with waffles.  When you order your drink, you've got to try the Kool-aid.  Yes, I'm serious!

Lo-Lo's you've got me all worked up again.  If you could just have some friendly, fast service, I'd be regular and you'd be a bit richer."}
{"text":"Bomb food! Steaming hot food for sure hit the spot! The waffles taste great and have hint of cinnamon that will make French toast lovers a fan! Will be back thanks y'all"}
{"text":"I'm a fan! It seems like I only get here about once a year but I enjoy it every time I do. I may be an adult but I still love Kool Aid and it's not often you come across a place that serves it. I drank so much I was ready to float away. I ordered the Puffs chicken tender basket with a waffle instead of fries. You also get a choice of bbq or ranch for your tenders. I opted for the ranch and it was just ok. I prefer to eat my chicken with the waffle and syrup anyways. The chicken was moist and flavorful and the waffle was tender and delicious. We all ordered the same thing at the table but we also shared a side of Mac and cheese which was super creamy and delicious. A major improvement of per the Kraft we usually have at home.

The service started out a bit slow but finished strong. Our server was very friendly. The atmosphere is bright, fun and casual.

My entree, Kool Aid and tip came to $21.00. It seems pricey for one person for lunch but it was a rare treat and so worth it. We left stuffed!"}
{"text":"BLUF
Got it to go and glad I did. The chicken was OK but only for the first couple of bites.  The red velvet cake was aweful. 

Background
Yelpers let me down on this one.  I ordered the three piece chicken meal expecting to stuff myself contented with fried goodness and slip into a glycosidic stupor from a criminally sized slab of red velvet cake.  Let me say I didn't have to watch the scale worried of well earned weight gain from this meal.  

The chicken was an initial hit but was short lived.  I didn't finish it nor did I want to.  The waffle did not travel well either, it was soggy by arrival (10 mins to the hotel - arrgh!)  nor was it flavored in any manor. I would liken it to the generic bread slices used at other joints for sopping up the grease.  The red velvet was a crime.  It too lacked flavor, was heavy beyond understanding and it hurts me to say this - was only deserving of the trash. wa, wa, waaaa.

$20+ for soul food that was so bad."}
{"text":"When I want a completely over indulged, guilty-pleasure, (what diet?) meal I come here. I love Lolo's. The staff is warm and friendly. There's usually a wait (Scottsdale location), but it moves fast and is so worth it. If you're counting calories don't come here...you will starve, there's nothing for you on the menu :) But if you want comfort food, soul food...read on. I always start with a nice tall jar (love) of old school red kool-aid! I die, it reminds me of being a kid, so good and pure sugar. Everything I have tried has been wonderful: fried okra, grits with butter (yum), fried chicken, waffles, greens, mac&cheese, and to conclude a fabulous meal red-velvet cake. Take-out is great and done well."}
{"text":"OH man! When I saw that they have Red Kool aid I was like a kid again. I love this place. Amazing food and service. \"Lil Amadi\" was phenomenal, Chicken in waffles are one of my new favorite food variation so Delicious! Specially after drinking down on old town, then stop by Lo-Lo's and pick up some chicken & waffles late night is the way mmmm. Getting a craving now, you can never get enough. Oh yea and the Kool aid, just like mom made."}
{"text":"My wife and I and friends have eaten here many times. A must stop for eating. Get the idea that chicken and waffles don't go together out of your mind. They are incredible together!! I have converted many people to loving them. Fresh greens, beans, Mac and cheese ,all of the wonderful delights are available at lo-lo's. Incredible fried chicken. Friendly helpful service. Reasonably priced and always a delight. Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Have heard so much about this place and glad I gave it a try.  Reasonable prices, friendly and accommodating staff, with delicious food.  The fried chicken was juicy and crispy with tender meat on the inside and the waffles were soft since a warm cinnamon/butter taste with each bite.  Simply put, you HAVE to try this place at least once if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Waited for over half hour for table for seven to become available. No coordination between hostesses. When a table that was to be used for us one of the other hostesses gave the table away. When asked to be put out side we were told there wasn't enough servers to put us outside. I will never go to this business again. Maybe if there was an adult manager present something different would gave happened."}
{"text":"I'll give you the news first,  the chicken was very, very tasty,  I crave that chicken's flavor it was quite memorable.  Now the bad news,  did somebody trip with the sugar and the bag spilled into those soggy over cooked greens?  What was with that soggy old mac n cheese,  I miss my own mac and cheese,  I'll sell them the recipe for a good price.  I also had mystery soda,  it was supposed to be Mr. Pibb or Dr. Pepper but I drink Dr. Pepper everyday,  that dark stuff was not Dr. Pepper or Mr. Pibb!"}
{"text":"Gluttony at it's finest.  There is nothing more satisfying than a meal of chicken and waffles.  The chicken was moist and flavorful and the waffles had a slight hint of cinnamon flavor.  To top it off, they serve kool-aid in mason jars and the sweet tea is mostly sugar, but still majorly awesome."}
{"text":"When I am craving soul food, this is the first place I think of. I love the decor, the music is always good and the food is great. You get a good amount of food for the money and staff are professional. Like any other popular restaurant, when they are really busy the service might slip slightly but that's why I go when it's not busy or I get my food to go. Either way it's always worth it. Do yourself this favor, large menu, I'm sure you will find something you like."}
{"text":"I went here to try the chicken and waffles since I believe that is their specialty. There's nothing special to it to be honest. It doesn't come with any gravy and you should pay an extra a dollar for it? Seriously? I think it's overpriced for the quality of the food. It was packed when I went here and the service is quite slow. The server is pretty friendly and helpful though."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing! We walked in first thing in the morning. The place was super clean and someone was singing in the back \" were open, were open\". I found that completely charming and welcoming. We were promptly greeted and our order was taken shortly thereafter. The chicken was great dont know what they did but it was moist and perfectly seasoned. The waffles had this nutty goodness. Portions were large. 

I live in Mesa but have dreamed of it since. Need to make my way back there to try the catfish, oka and red velvet cake. Yummy for my tummy."}
{"text":"This is most definitely not Roscoe's chicken and waffles but it is the closest thing to soul food out here in Az. The catfish is good but a little over salted. The service is good overall. Will go back"}
{"text":"The combination of chicken and waffles has baffled me for years. I never quite understood what would inspire a chef to serve these two unlikely meals on the same plate, but couldn't ignore how much folks raved about it. Day 25 of my 30 day blogging challenge  called for a \"first\" of sorts and I figured I'd get out of the house and do something new. Despite seeming like a breakfast/dinner clusterfuck, I opened my mind as well as my stomach, and ventured to Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles.

It had been years since I went to the original Phoenix restaurant (the epitome of a hole in the wall) but I did remember the food being good. Since the company branched out to include a Scottsdale location I was thrilled to only travel 5 mins for food. The location is nice, though I agree it doesn't have quite the \"charm\" of the original location. It felt more like a little, sit down restaurant than a hot food spot.

I fought the urge to stick with what I know and get catfish... but ended up biting the bullet and ordering the #10 (Tre-Tre - $7) which consisted of 2 legs and 1 waffle, a side of fried okra ($3.50) and \"red\" kool-aid.The restaurant happened to be running low on legs so there was a bit of a wait but I came equipped with a magazine so it wasn't a big deal.

The Verdict? It wasn't a bad meal but I don't think I'd ever order this again. It didn't taste bad... not at all, but I guess it just felt like I was paying for something my mom could've made me lol. The only reason to pay for this meal is because you don't have access to cooking it yourself. The Okra was just okay. I like Church's okra better. My mom has made better chicken but I'd take their waffles. This meal reminded me of going to Sprinkles for cupcakes. It's more about the hype around the place  than the actual meal itself... or it could be because my mom is from the heart of Mississippi and knows how to put her foot in southern food. Ehh.. I'm glad to say that I tried something new so I can turn it down in the future based on personal experience and not a notion.

Sidenote: The credit card machine was glitching out when I was there so next time I'd just bring cash. The staff was VERY friendly and it was a pleasant experience... just felt like I paid for a meal I could've gotten from home."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Lolos.  We heard great things about their food.  My sister wanted to go for her birthday so we decided to check it out.  It was a busy Sunday and the hostess quoted us for about 45 minutes.  We understood and waited patiently. After an hour wait we asked the hostess how much longer it would be since we had our two young children also waiting patiently and getting very hungry.  She said five more parties ahead of us.  We noticed people that were there after us getting seated before us.  People came and left before we were even seated.  We asked again, losing our patience at this point and the hostess said wrote the number wrong and skipped our name.  She saw us seating there the whole time and was not apologetic at all.   We do not like to be demanding and remained patient due to the fact that we all worked the service industry in the past.  It was extremely frustrating that they did not take into account their mistake and disregarded me and my family during this time.   After an hour and forty five minute wait we finally got seated.  I did not want to leave at that point but I will never go back because of them.  The waitress was very nice and got a 20% tip but it's frustrating knowing that those hostesses will get a percentage of that.  They need better people skills and definitely how to have efficient customer service.  The food was great just not an adequate representation of their service. 

Maria"}
{"text":"Awesome!  If you haven't tried it, you have to; that's all I'm going to say.   I really want to go back again."}
{"text":"We love chicken n waffles and Lo Lo's is the best.  The service is always nice and polite."}
{"text":"I was very excited to finally get to try this Lo Lo's chicken and waffles only to be let down by the lack of seasoning in the chicken, the almost \"eggo\" low quality of the waffles and the unbelievable amount of sugar in the red koolaid type drink. As I ate it I could almost feel myself getting fatter. When I got back to work I felt the after effects as my body began to crash like I was going into a coma. The three women I ate there with loved it though but they all were very used to this type of food having gone there weekly for some time. The three women I was with were also obese and not health conscious at all. The quantities were big but the taste and quality were not and I doubt I'll be back any time soon."}
{"text":"First of all drinks are served in large Mason jars which is awesome! Food came out very fast & our waitress Mari was amazing! She took great care of us and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food. Maximum calories per dollar.  Just AWESOME!"}
{"text":"The stupid fries are stupidly good! How can you go wrong with fries topped with chunks of chicken, gravy, cheese, peppers and onions? We came in for a late lunch one saturday and the wait was minimal. I had the Phat Boy. It came with 2 eggs, grits, a biscuit and choice of meat. I had turkey bacon and added a side of gravy for my biscuit. Everything was excellent. Their gravy isnt the typical white gravy I am used to seeing at breakfast but its very tasty and has a kick to it. My other half got some kind of breakfast \"samich\" and he loved his as well. The only down side to our meal was that we waited a long time for it. Then our waiter forgot our stupid fries and we had to ask for them. When they finally came- AFTER our meal, we were going to send them back but got seduced into \"just trying\" them, which turned quickly into \"eating half\" of them. Damn you stupid fries! We left happy, overfull, and ready to start trying to walk off some of the damage we just did."}
{"text":"Best Soul Food in the valley eh? Well maybe, but in a town who's very soul seems to be slipping away, they are the best compared to who? I like comfort food, in fact I love it, and bolstered by all the amazing reviews...I wanted to loooove this place, but alas, did not. Hype, hype, hype....

The buzz is undeniable though, we went on an off day of the week, though the 30 minute wait would indicate that right now Lo-Lo dont got no off days.

10 minutes after being seated in a corner next to the bus station and fire exit, and a few confused/concerned looks from several bussers/servers, we were greeted by an \"are you guys ready to order?\"
....well hello to you to miss young thing in a hurry.

Alright, the food.
So, the lady gets three breakfast sides to piece together, since she couldnt find a combo that appealed to her. I got a chicken breast, waffle and eggs combo with a side of grits.

25 minutes later....

One of lady gnomes sides arrived on a one size too small plate with some scrambled eggs hanging off the edges.

10 minutes later...

My full combo arrives...presentation is certainly not Lo-Lo's strong suit, but then...its obviously just not a priority here, and I'm ok with that,

5 minutes later.... her sausage arrives....you get the idea.

Heres the verdict:
Grits: Good, but grits are pretty idiot proof. Youd have to go out of your way to mess those up.
Eggs: Fine. See Grits above.
Sausage: Very very good. ( I mean really good)
Fried Chicken Breast: Dry, Bland. (at Lolo's CHICKEN & Waffles)
Waffles: Thin, flacid...almost soggy and that was WITHOUT having put any syrup on it yet...(at Lolo's Chicken & WAFFLES)

We spent about 2 hours here altogether, maybe 15 minutes of which was us actually eating. Which gave us plenty of time to admire the ambiance and design. The pictures of the (owner's?) Kids on the walls playing in the kitchen were ADORABLE (genuinely) Everything was clean and polished, the staff all wearing newly minted Lo-Lo tee's with tongue in cheek witicisms written on their backs like \"Backyard Pimp\"...and I suddenly get the feeling that I had just come to see the new Lo-Lo's - Bruckheimer movie without having read the wonderfully poignent book on which it was based. The original Lo-Lo's as I understand it is a shack in down town phoenix, without hardly a menu and an honor system of payment. I get the distinct feeling that that building is where they left the Soul...and honestly I think I'm going to go looking for it....maybe I'll take a good book with me.

The novelty of Kool Aid in a mason jar can only get you so far....so for Lo-Lo's sake I hope all those 5 star reviews are warranted, not just hype, and that our experience was an isolated one... but for me , the search for soul definitely does not end here."}
{"text":"Yummy! In town for spring break with family and we loved it! Chicken and waffles are delicious and of course we had to have the kool-aid."}
{"text":"The fried catfish was very good but the chicken was only satisfactory. The waffle was alright but had a strong cinnamon taste which I wasn't a fan of. The corn bread and mac and cheese were good. The atmosphere was noisy, even at 9:30 on a Thursday night."}
{"text":"Please believe everything GOOD about this place! The food was great and so was the service.  Brittany, the waitress, was kind and friendly and made great suggestions regarding the menu. Only draw back was the mac & cheese was luke warm versus hot, however, it was very good."}
{"text":"I decided after coming back from a business trip to take my family for breakfast to Lolo's Chicken & Waffles (ala Roscoe's in LA).  When engaging my family to visit this establishment, my kids were definitely not a fan of chicken w/waffles, kind of spoiled or use to a 'different' type of meal for breakfast.

In any event, we arrived for a 10 minute wait or so, friendly vibe, clean atmosphere, and people seem to be in good spirits leaving.  My expectations were open, and upbeat.  

This review is mainly for the manager who saved a potential nightmare experience.  Waitress comes along, gets order, another lady comes along 15 minutes later with four drinks, of which the oj is out of a bottle oppose to it being in the jar.  Whatever works, but a bit pricey for a bottle you can pick up at your local costco, or sam's club.  In any event, we waited approximately 35 minutes for our order, and although they stated our order was held up because the kids desired bacon, and sausage oppose to chicken (huh?) but we stayed patient.  The food arrives, and the manager did the correct thing, came over and apologized for the long delay.  I didn't moan, but did whisper to my wife that we'll NEVER come to this place again.  Unbeknownst to me, a certain individual comes over, and hands me a bill, and I reviewed it, and confirmed, I would never come to this place again as it was an insult to take off drinks, not looking for a handout, he came back a few minutes later and said, he was sorry, and handed me a revised bill which made me feel as though they truly recognized customer service was a \"f\", and corrected the mistake.

Customer service is what these restaurants live by, and after all of this, I have to give the Manager of Lolo's a A+ for recognizing there was a potential influential customer that wasn't going to return nor give business to people in passing.  Food was good :).   I will be a frequent customer of Lolo's and would recommend if going have patience as they supply good food, and the demand is there."}
{"text":"It's definitely interesting the atmosphere here is very loud but always full.. So far the waitress has taken about 20 min to finally get our order.. The food is good, I get the Waffle Breakfast Sammich.

So the time it took for our food makes me drop a star. The food is good. The coffee is way to strong meaning too many scoops in the coffee. The service needs to be better for busy days."}
{"text":"My husband & I had lunch there today!  Awesome service by Brenee!  So many great menu choices it was hard to decide!  We started out with Fried Green Tomatoes & Catfish Beignets & orange cream sicles to drink!  Both were incredible! Husband ordered Breakfast #1 - chicken & waffles, grits and eggs.  I ordered the shrimp grits - both dishes amazing!!!! We had so much food leftover ... Guess what's for dinner?! : ) We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Oh Dear Lord I know gluttony is a sin but this food was the bomb diggity. Mrs. White did a awesome job teaching her son to cook soul food. Everything was just like I remember when eating at Mrs. White's and I was not disappointed.  The kool-aid drinks were delicious and refreshing. Steven our server was amazing, kind and energetic.  I know I will be back to try other things off the menu and I can't wait."}
{"text":"Two great tastes that go great together. Chicken and waffles. Listen health nuts or Lolo-virgins, stop grimacing a the instagram photos posted and try this place for yourself. You like fried chicken, and you like waffles so put them both together and try not to freak out. Very friendly service. Love the mason jar glasses and bottomless purple Kool-aid. We miss living nearby but always visit when we are in town. Also try the mac n cheese. Even the basic scrambled eggs are fluffy and delicious. Betty Boop. Betty Boop. Betty Boop. Trey Trey. Yep, that's our order. See for yourself."}
{"text":"I was happy to see this in Terminal 4 pre-security and have been eating here for years.  My go to is he Betty Boop. One fried chicken breast and one waffle. Perfect. And at $9 is very reasonable for airport food. That sweet and salty goodness is well balanced perfection. BUT let me forewarn you. Chicken takes time to cook. So be patient. However, service here is abysmal. The female cashier on 6/26 had NO sense of urgency whatsoever. It was painful watching her complete one task at a time. I can see why people get so frustrated here. Even another employee came out to get a drink who may have been a supervisor but offered no assistance and there was a line around 12:30pm. I've never had this issue at the brick and mortar locations. She was also so unfriendly like I was doing her a favor by ordering. I probably prefer the other locations but this was a treat having landed for business at Sky Harbor. There's plenty of food court seating too. Not sure how I feel about the styrofoam container either as it could potentially make everything soggy of you're taking this to go. I would have given this two stars alone for service. If this is run by airport concessions or HMS Host they need to clean up their act."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!  Yes, parking is an issue...and yes, it's cramped and crowded and run down inside, BUT that is part of the whole experience.  The food is amazing!  The fried chicken is the best around, coupled with the waffles...and then I usually add grits, scrambled eggs with cheese and onions, side of bacon, side of mac n' cheese...and wash it down with some tasty red koolaid in a mason jar.  The red velvet cake is a MUST for dessert...order it to go if you are too full, it's SO good!

They do have a newer location in Scottsdale that his much bigger, but it just isn't quite the same as the original Phoenix location.

If you are going for lunch, get there early(like 11:30 or earlier), otherwise you will be waiting in line outside the place for a long time."}
{"text":"My brother always told me this place had great food and he goes there a lot. I finally decided to eat there and now I am thinking I have been missing out on this place for so long. We went for breakfast and I had the KK. Two scrambled eggs with onions and cheese, grits, two huge waffles, and three pieces of chicken. It was awesome! It's one of the best breakfast meals that I have ever had in my life. I would suggest going there for breakfast or lunch, the area may be a little scary during dinner time. We saw a guy pushing his house down the street."}
{"text":"Glad my colleagues took me to this spot. Good food. I got waffles, chicken, grits, eggs and bacon. There wasn't a morsel of food left when I got up. I mean I cleaned the plates and bowl. Don't judge me! 

I love my waffles soft. Done
Like crispy chicken with seasoning. Done
Eggs scrabbled hard with cheese- semi done
Grits- yum. Done
Bacon crispy so the fat is not clear. Done

I will definitely be back when I am back in Phoenix.

I will have to try the koolaid and see what they are working with. Hopefully it is a jar of colored sugar water like koolaid is supposed to be. Haha. 

Looking forward to coming back and I don't say that often."}
{"text":"Food here was sooo good, definitely recommend the stupid fries. Also you can't go wrong with the dranks.  There's a bit of a wait so get there early"}
{"text":"M:  $52 on this cc, $25 on the other CC, and the rest is cash
S:  I'm sorry what was that?

S:  I'm sorry, I'm just so distracted by her over there.

Haha, it isn't the first time my friend's been hit on, but I just thought it was funny  that the server was ready to mount her from the minute we stepped in.  

Anyway, this place I think it's much better than Roscoe's.  The chicken is much more tender, but the amount of crisp is just right and not as greasy as Roscos.  6/7 girls preferred Lolo's.  Service is interesting, they were friendly in their unique way.  The menus and posters crack me up.  The beverage menu says \"a jar of drank\" for $2.50.   Hehe I couldn't help but giggle...too cute.

Cliff's Note:

Food:  4 STARS
Avg Price $11-13 a plate
Service:  3 STARS

Ordered:
Lolo's plate made the traditional southern way.  3 chickens, 2 waffles. Yummm!!!

Home fries $3.50.  It was a table favorite, but I personally could do without the garnishments."}
{"text":"My mother came to town and wanted some breakfast. We stopped at Lo-Lo's and of course, the food was perfect. Anything that you could imagine having at a morning meal; they had and a little something for the kids as well. 

I had the Red Velvet pancakes and let me tell you \"Be Ready!\" Moist, delicious, and flavorful. a must try.

{"text":"Unfortunately, there was no response from the owners. Would be nice to know they read their customer's feedback and respond to issues. However, I did give them a fair shot and tried it again in hopes the discrimination (or reverse-discrimination) I experienced was a fluke.

About 7 months later, on October 3rd, I returned to try it again. There was no discrimination and we were treated extremely well by the staff. The food was just as good as the last time. It was fantastic. I found myself humming and moaning and licking my fingers and sucking every drop of flavor from all the food, my sweetie's leftovers, our delicious alcohol drinks and our appetizer. Seriously, it is like food from heaven. I do love the atmosphere, it's casual, but fun, loud, but not really loud, hard to explain,....upbeat, fun, relaxed, vibrant,....the building is really cool for such a sketchy part of town.

So, in all fairness, if last time was just a fluke, and this time is the norm. I'd say, don't miss it, it's delicious!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The music was amazing and the food was incredible. They were really nice and they messed up something on our order and they more than made up for it. Love this spot."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the delicious fried chicken that was crispy on the outside, juicy and moist inside.  Came with the yummy grits with a little bit of brown sugar and the tasty egg cooked with onions. Loved it!  Service was great. The staff person who seated us was really nice and our server, Annette was super nice too, attentive and took care of us!"}
{"text":"We visited often at the previous location and never had a bad experience but not likely to return at the new spot next to the Holiday Inn Express. Forced use of valet parking was the first bad sign. You either valet or, like us, park across the street and walk. All other spaces are reserved for hotel guests. The restaurant was busy and very loud. We were seated and placed our order for both drinks (including water--it was a hot afternoon) and food fairly quickly, but had to wait a good 15 minutes before we got the drinks. When we did we got three of our drinks in the large mason jars and one in a small one with no waters...they apparently ran out of clean glasses. After another 20 plus minutes we finally get the water and another 20 before we got our food. No check ins from our waitress no refills. It wasn't just us--the table next to us was waiting for a takeout order and there was some issue addressed with the manager. I was going to mention our poor service to him but he disappeared. We love LoLos but will try the Gilbert location or go downtown before going back to Scottsdale,"}
{"text":"Not health food but worth the 20 minutes of life you lose by eating there.  The food is stick to your ribs delicious. Fried Chicken great. Waffles Great. Fried Okra great.  You need to get there around 11:00 if you expect to sit down right away so if you go later expect to wait."}
{"text":"Delicious Delicious Delicious

LoLo's will satisfy your craving for southern cooking for the change in your pocket. The option to have all white meat is there although when you come to a place like LoLo's go all the way. The staff is nice and welcoming. Tip Tip Tip the wait staff some of them wait on a lil stool outside in the heat to greet people

#5 is what I ordered and it was great!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting forever to try chicken and waffles and I'm so glad Lo-Lo's was the spot to pop my chicken and waffles cherry. 

It's a humble restaurant in the middle of nowhere, which, had it not been for the huge text sprawled on the side of a building, we would have never noticed the tiny entrance. 

I came here with my girlfriend while visiting her at institute and this was one of the highest reviewed restaurants in the area so we thought it would be a good idea to give it a try. 

The staff is extremely welcoming and helpful. They took the time to help us find a way to the restaurant using public transportation(we were coming from ASU so we had to use both the light rail and bus system) when the trip planner had failed us miserably and would otherwise have left us stranded in 100 degree weather. 

The space is very cozy and the table and chairs are very much something laypeople could own(wood - painted, none of that hyper-modern furniture here). It's not a super big restaurant so I imagine they could get packed very easily during peak business hours. 

The food here is absolutely amazing. I got to try a few dishes:

1. Lil' Amadi(waffle plus leg and thigh of chicken) - This is the best fried chicken I've ever had. The skin was not soggy at all and had a very nice crisp/crunch to eat. The skin was not rubbery at all and gave away easily with a little resistance(which is nice, because super flaky skin is never good and a teeny bit of resistance keeps the skin together on the chicken). The skin to meat ratio was also good - in other words, I didn't feel like I was either eating nothing but skin or that they were being skimpy with the skin. The meat was extremely juicy and my girlfriend let me try some of her white meat and it is one of the few times(other than in Pho) that I've had white meat that is juicy. The waffle was also one of the best waffles I've ever had and I usually hate waffles. The waffle here was on the thinner side and had great texture. It was slightly crispy on the outside while maintaining a very moist inside - great texture combination. Also, the waffle wasn't soggy. This is key because I usually hate Belgian waffles because they're too thick, cakey, and tend to get soggy in the middle and are just plain gross. They give you a healthy dose of butter and syrup which made eating the chicken and waffles much more enjoyable.

Soul Food Platter - My girlfriend and I basically ordered two dishes and tried eachother's dishes. The soul food platter allows you to choose between chicken or fish and a choice of two side dishes and corn bread. My girlfriend got chicken(three-ish pieces - sometimes I don't consider the chicken wing a full piece because of the higher bone to meat ratio than other parts of the chicken), collard greens, and mac-n-cheese. The collard greens were delicious! They weren't too salty like some of the other times I've tried them. They were also cooked just right - not too soft due to overcooking but not too hard due to undercooking. The leaves were soft and the stalk gave more solid texture to juxtapose with the leaves(but not saying that the stalk was hard - it wasn't - just more firm than the leaves). The mac-n-cheese was okay. I've definitely had better. To me, it was a slightly more gourmet version of the Kraft's mac-n-cheese. The corn bread was also just okay. It was on the more dry side and I ended up having to dip the corn bread in sauce because my salivary glands were running low on lubricant. 

Red Beans - These were delicious! My girlfriend thinks they cooked them with ham to give it a slightly smokey, salty taste and I think I agree. They're not too sweet which I definitely find to be a characteristic of cheap red beans. Lo-Lo's makes an effort to actually make their red beans savory and it's very evident. The sauce goes great with the cornbread as extra lubricant. 

In regards to side dishes I recommend getting the collard greens and red beans. 

Sweet Tea - My girlfriend says that iced tea is usually lackluster because it's just like drinking tea - except cold and that the defining factor to sweet tea is that it's sweet and refreshing - something cold drinks should be. I agree. The sweet tea here was divine and a perfect beverage to our meal and great to have when the weather outside was 100 degrees. Another big plus is that there were unlimited refills! It's served in a huge jar and we easily went through two of them. Amazing. 

One regret I have is not trying the red velvet cake. 

The food here is decently priced. It came out to roughly $27 for the both of us and we left extremely full and happy. 

The reason why I hesitate giving Lo-Lo's five stars is because I'm not a veteran chicken and waffles eater, but rather, a recently deflowered chicken and waffles novice. Until I've had more chicken and waffles to compare to, I will hold off the five stars and just give four stars for now. 

I definitely recommend this place to anyone in town!"}
{"text":"Went with my brother and grandmother. Took an hour to get our food. The waitress with the shaved head was rude. My bloody marry was watery and flavorless, and the waffles were soggy. The chicken wasn't bad but not great. I really wanted to like this place. The only think keeping us happy was our waitress Nicole (I think that was her name). I could hear her complaining about how long it took for us to get our food and she kept checking up on us."}
{"text":"This place NEVER disappoints. I've been here numerous times during the my 7 months of living in the Valley. Great service ALL the time.I'm from the South and this is where I go to get my soulfood fix when I don't cook lol. The fried chicken is always fresh (I order the two drumsticks and waffle combo) and flavorful. Trust me, I am the type of person who only ate fried chicken from my mom's kitchen. The kool-aid brings me back to childhood and the waffle is always made just right...golden brown and not over done.  :-) The only thing keeping me from going more are calories lol."}
{"text":"I loved the slogan of \"hood dining at its best\" and it is the best! The chicken was crispy and juicy. The flavor was outstanding! Best fried chicken ever!!!! I need a Lolo's to open in the DMV area!!!"}
{"text":"Lo Lo's is such a uniquely delicious place for breakfast, lunch or dinner. If you haven't tried chicken and waffles this is the place to start. The chicken is perfectly fried, very crispy and has great seasoning. I feel like they put some type of spice or cinnamon in their waffles that makes them so addicting. But not only that, the regular entrées are tasty too. Get ready for a sugar coma on the sweet tea, lemonade, or Kool-Aid. Only downside is service is a little slow. This place is amazing!"}
{"text":"Food is good as always, but today I think they needed to hire a few dishwashers. It took them a minute for them to bring out our eating utensils, after asking and after we got our food served."}
{"text":"I like to come here with my coworkers for lunch sometimes but the service is very slow. Not the place for someone who is short on time. The food is good though."}
{"text":"Terrific food, wonderful staff, and a fun atmosphere. 

The chicken is really good, as are the sides. Not the biggest fan of the waffles, though."}
{"text":"1st time and service sucks bad! I sat the bar and was ignored for 20 min.
Dirty dishes all over the bar which were shoved aside and sat during my wait.
Finally water came, still no server after 10 min more.
I finally walked out!"}
{"text":"Convention day started off with a bang with a super cool workshop from 10-5 today followed up by a run to Lo-Lo's.  Now, this place is located opposite someplace with barbed wire on the fence and adjacent to some pretty decrepit looking buildings.  The waitress told us to sit anywhere and we located a mini-room with an open table.

I ordered the BABY RAY (3 pcs of chicken (I chose leg, thigh, and wing) smothered in gravy and onions).  First off, the pieces were just massive.  I mean large, but incredibly juicy and tasty.  The gravy was good, as were the waffles.

I also shared the CHICKEN GIZZARDS & RICE served smothered in onions and gravy.  I didn't care for this too much as both deep frying this thing and smothering it in gravy were just a bit on the much side.  The CANDY SWEETS (yams) were just okay as well.  I washed it all down with some fine 1/2 sweet tea and 1/2 lemonade.

Overall, I like the fried chicken and gravy in my neighborhood better (see Moe's Chicken & Waffles in Fontana, CA), but I don't think you'll be disappointed by Lo-Lo's.  As far as a need to eat in this area, I think FEZ wins this bout."}
{"text":"So I was cruising around today trying to find a place to eat lunch before a doctor's appointment when I drove past Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles. I have never eaten here before so I did a u turn and pull into the parking lot. When I walked into this brightly lite restaurant I was greeted right away by the hostess who took me to a booth.  Aaron my waiter showed up within a few minutes and took my drink request. I was going to get chicken until I saw someone else get the French toast.  My order came really fast. I like the fact that you can get breakfast anytime of the day. OMG my french toast melted in my mouth!!!!! Aaron was very attentive and checked up on me a lot. Other wait staff also asked if I needed anything,( a sign of good training. ) Would I come back here again? Yes,yes and yes"}
{"text":"Authentic, relaxed atmosphere, reminds me of Louisiana!"}
{"text":"The chicken strips are SO good here! Probably my top favorite place to order them, the fries are awesome too, love their seasoning. I'm not a fan of their waffles though, the cinnamon just kind of throws it off for me. The service is always great. There's usually a wait on the weekends & parking can be a pain when it's really busy."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Lo-Lo's since they moved out of the original location, so decided to check it out recently for some southern food.  I ordered the chicken smothered with gravy and onions with sides of mac 'n cheese and corn and a slice of cornbread.  It was oh so bad for you, but oh so tasty...and good every once in a while (like maybe only once a year).  Love that they update the wait on Yelp, so you know what you're getting into.  This popular place gets super busy, so pick the right time to stop in for a visit.  Nice atmosphere, good service and tasty comfort food!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome true southern food! The waffles are the best I have ever tasted sweet and crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. The fried chicken is perfect, it's all good! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"One of my friends insisted that I try Lolo's so we went during a lunch hour. Fortunately we arrived before it got crowded. I ordered the a combination plate that included about half of the items on the menu. About 15 minutes later our food arrived, but my order was everything on the menu but what I ordered. I figured that since it looked and smelled so good I would bite my lip and eat what I had in front of me. The waitress walked by and noticed. She insisted that they make me the plate that I ordered and the one that I had been eating was on the house. At first I said no...but she wouldn't hear of it. The rest of the menu was sitting in front of me in five minutes. Now...I am a good sized guy with a ravenous appetite, but that was ridiculous. I will say that everything was delicious. I had a little bit of everything. The highlight of the meal was the MACARONI AND CHEESE. BEFORE YOU DIE (caution: it might be the CAUSE of your death) you must eat their mac and cheese.

All in all, a great eating experience."}
{"text":"The food is okay. But super expensive for some basic chicken. But honestly i didnt like mashed potatos. They where a real disappointment"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed the food at Lo-Lo's for years at both the Phoenix and Scottsdale locations. I love the occasional calorie splurge of chicken and waffles.

  I was concerned with the parking at the new location (3133 N Scottsdale Rd)  after reading a couple of reviews on here. I went for lunch at 11:40am on a Wednesday and found a number of parking spots open. There was a valet station when I arrived, but nobody was using valet parking so the attendant eventually packed up his umbrella and left. The friends I joined had been to the new location before without encountering parking problems. 

 I would characterize the parking as marginally adequate... and I can imagine problems when it gets crowded. The location is right next to a Holiday Inn Express with a shared parking lot but it seems clear which spots belong to the hotel. 

 The kitchen was a bit slow... but not bad (similar to the old location) and the waitress was efficient. I'll return as long as there's adequate parking."}
{"text":"I've had Roscoe's in LA, so I was a bit skeptical of a chicken and waffle house in Scottsdale of all places - however, they do a great job!  

I always get the Betty Boop, chicken breast and waffle, and I'm never disappointed.  The flavor of the waffle is so delicious you don't even need syrup.  I've also figured out that the best bite includes a piece of chix, waffle and hot sauce - yummy!  

Just be sure you get there early - it fills up fast.

Forgot to mention that this may be the least expensive breakfast in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in the state . . . maybe the world.

Get the Swate Tay (sweet tea) and the \"Lolos\" (i think it's #3). The fried catfish is great too. Everything is great. They play gospel music on Sundays yayyuhhh"}
{"text":"OMG! who'da thunk that home cooking could be made for the masses day in and day out. this place had rib sticking food and the best lemonade i've had in a while, it was drank in a jar! we arrived about 12:45pm and saw a line outside, when we almost turned away. it wasn't until my friend Dirty Red pointed out all the caucassians standing off yuma and central in the hood, during the hottest part of the day that made me realize this must be a gold spot!

well damn Dirty Red was right! i had the Betty Boop, mac n' cheese and cornbread. my sister the BB too, but with string beans and potatoes (they tasted like they were in a pork broth very tasty). Dirty Red had the biggest meal on the menu and lucky for us, he shared his homestyle potatoes & beans and rice. 

the chicken was so moist, while fried to perfection! the waffle was thin with buckwheat (i think) and cinnamon. i'm not usually a waffle fan, but this waffle was amazing. the mac n' cheese was so yummy i literally cleaned my plate (my only complaint was the small serving-but i'm sure they knew it was just the right amount) the homefries were great, fried to a perfect golden brown with perfectly soft potatoes on the inside, they melted in my mouth. 

our only  complaint was the bad service (which i really think is only part of the overall dining experience) we were served our drinks at sporadic times, presented with our food and no utensils (i got up to request some, and 5 minutes later Dirty Red had to get up to request some). but ya know what, it wasn't enought to taint my meal...i just picked up my plump chicken breast and went to town, the waffle had to wait. 

overall the food is well worth the wait, drive or whatever your obstacle. its the best fried chicken i've had...well..... ever!! go to lolo's you wont regret it!

but first you must find the door, it's off yuma by the misters. 

WARNING: i went home and crashed the F'out after eating here, so be prepared."}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! Yum!

Chicken and waffles combined are delicious sin! Soul food in general is usually delicious sin if you are counting calories but counting calories shouldn't even be thought of if entering this place; you'll want to try everything! By everything I mean chicken, waffles, grits, eggs, home fries, Kool-Aid and many many more goodies that are served here (and trust me, you should try as much as you can). 

Go get yourself some soul food already and leave this place smiling!"}
{"text":"You're coming here entirely for the fried chicken and my review is 90% for the fried chicken. I think it'd be a smart idea to pretty much disregard almost everything else that isn't related. The fried chicken here is hands down the best I've had in Phoenix. Lo-Lo's has a large menu allowing you to pick what else you want to accompany your fried chicken. If you're just hankering for chicken you can also order it a la carte as well. This is what my group did:

There were 6 of us so we ordered the teaser trio with spicy corn fritters, fried gizzard, and catfish beignets. After that we all ordered some amount of fried chicken along with whatever else we wanted. Some of us got waffles, some got pancakes, some got a fried chicken salad with more fried chicken because they thought getting a salad at a fried chicken place made it okay (me). This is the realization I had, they fry things really well here. I don't know what their recipe is but it's really good. It's not terribly greasy or overly cornmeal-y, it's just done very very well. 

On to the other much less important things;
This place is busy and you should be ready for a wait. the 6 of us were lucky and got a table under 20 minutes but that was at 10:45 and on a weekday. I can assure you that there will be empty tables when you go in and you will wonder why you can't just sit down immediately. Just be patient.

The restaurant is very clean and has a nice sort of re-purposed modern feel to it. The menus are a little sticky because their main thing is chicken + waffles, but really fried chicken is finger food, so it's not bad. 

Overall, if you like fried chicken you pretty much *have* to try Lo-Lo's."}
{"text":"The word AMAZING comes to mind. Great place to go and eat until your heart is content. Or until it explodes, whichever comes first. An odd combo but who the heck cares when you are suffering from the blues?
I recommend, therefore I am right."}
{"text":"Chicken kinda dry and plain.  Waffle okay and a little softer than I prefer.  Was super hungry and ate the whole 3 piece meal which filled me up."}

Love the chicken! Not a fan of the waffles, but to each his own.

The menu is great with a lot of options."}
{"text":"I been going to Lo Lo's Chicken & Waffles since way back when the place was a whole in the wall & the owners where actually part of the business. Now the owners are so concentrated in making so much money they have failed to realize their business is going down the hole! I'm very disappointed in the services for the past few visits, today I am passed disappointed I'm infuriated in the poor quality of the food! Uncooked chicken! (Disgusting) I asked for pecans in my waffles, I literally got 10 crushed pieces of pecans (Unacceptable if I'm paying $1 extra) I ordered corn bread (Disappointing, COLD!!!) I'm not a complainer but I expect to receive what I pay for, now I see how you became rich and it wasn't from selling fried chicken. I suggest the owner pay attention to the quality of her business instead of counting her dollars and spending them Houstons Steak house."}
{"text":"WHAT? You're hungry for breakfast and thirsty for a cocktail? This is the place to go! I have absolutely positively found my favorite place for breakfast. I splurged and broke my personal rules regarding having a mixed drink before noon and I'm so glad I did. No regrets! LoLo's Southern fried chicken and waffles with a Bacon Bloody Mary was perfecto! The chicken was cooked perfect with a crunchy skin and more flavor then I had imagined. The Bacon Bloody Mary was \"a party in my mouth\"! And of course it was too much food to finish, so in my classiest act I brought it home to enjoy again later! The whole staff was friendly and I was so intrigued with the uniform t-shirts! Did I mention the atmosphere? High ceilings, well lit (love the mason jar lights) and plenty of space and tv's all around. Thanks LoLo's for making my last day in Scottsdale one to remember. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Been here a few time the food and customer service are always consistent. Had Chris as a server recently took good care of us. But I Dislike there new valet service. If you choose not to use it you have to park on the street. Guess they don't want you imposing on their tips"}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE fan of the central Phx location but this one was a major let down. We came a few min after opening on a Saturday & there was maybe one other table. It took quite a bit to just get our waters & order. I had Puff's Chicken Basket which is my usual order with sausage gravy. The chicken was extremely bland and the gravy had the most overpowering green onion flavor. It took us so long to get our food then even longer to get our check. Not sure if it was just an off day or this location is less than stellar. I will probably skip trying this location again."}
{"text":"They desperately need to work on their customer service strategy. Why does it take over 1 hour for a piece of Chix and a waffle (their signature meal)? I noticed customers leaving because the service is so slowwwww. The host doesn't know how to seat customers timely or efficiently.  The prices are going up, the food is average and service is never great."}
{"text":"Went to Lo Lo's on Monday and while I was impressed with the chicken the service was not great. 

First the good, the chicken was moist and flavorful, mac and cheese & home fries also very good. 

The bad, I asked for a to go cup for my drink and they charged me $2.50....what $2.50, but I already had a drink I just wanted the rest to go, that really turned me off. Also, the service was lacking, we waited 20 mins for our bill and when we still didn't get it we had to go up to the counter and get it ourselves. Our server was to busy chatting up one of the other workers to pay attention to his tables.

All in all I would go back again for the chicken, but I don't think it's going to become a favorite."}
{"text":"I liked this place.  The ambiance is nice and the service is superb.  The mojito was delicious and so was the waffles.  My daughter was excited by the red velvet pancakes.  The down side was price - SO EXPENSIVE!  An order of pancakes was $13!  I can't afford to frequent this place very often."}
{"text":"After I flew back into town my husband and I decided to go here for lunch, since it was close to the airport and the food was excellent (up until this visit) 
I ordered biscuits with the chicken gravy, my husband had chicken and waffles and we got a banana pudding to go. 
We got home and we both felt kind of off, nothing major. Then around 6pm we decided to eat the banana pudding that we got earlier, yes it was refrigerated the whole time. Maybe a half hour after that I was bent over a toilet puking my guts out and dry heaving. This continued the whole night and I had to call in sick at my job. I ended up going to urgent care because it was so bad. There was really nothing they could do but give me anti nausea medication and make sure I wasn't dehydrated. I had full blown food poisoning. 
Here's the part that makes me not want to EVER return here; my husband called the establishment and asked for the manager, when he told the manager I had food poising and was really sick, HE HUNG UP.  So instead of saying he'd look into it or he would check the batch of pudding or gravy , HE HUNG UP. Really good customer service right there. Not to mention how sketchy that is for not owning up and being professional about it. 
So we called the Heath department and they said there have been multiple cases of food poisoning in the area.... 
This was the only meal I had eaten that day, so I know it wasn't something else. I won't ever come back to this location, and I'm cautions about the ones in better neighborhoods. After missing a day of work and sitting in the bathroom puking for hours, this place wasn't worth it. Stay away!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Lolo's. My family came along for the experience and we all had a great time. They provide huge portions, so prepare to take some home. I ordered the KK which was 3 pieces of chicken (fried and seasoned to perfection), two delicious waffles, eggs and grits. I took most of it home because it was too much to finish in one sitting. Great customer service and very welcoming. I will be back again. To be fair, I cannot compare this to Roscoe's because they are both good but I think Lolo's has the better chicken.  And the red velvet cake?? Amazing."}
{"text":"There's breakfast, and then there's breakfast. And this is breakfast done big. 

We stopped in for a little pre-work grub, and were seated immediately. Pretty quiet, with it being a weekday, and I was excited to give things a go. After being greeted and walked through the menu, we settled on a bit of everything--chicken, waffles, biscuits, gravy, eggs, and all the things that you slather on them.

the waffles are the round, thin kind. And while it was good, I didn't flip out over it. Then again, my portion didn't come with any of the upgraded caramel banana sauce, so it was just plain with maple syrup. I thought the chicken was okay, too. But the dark meat was far superior to the white, which, unfortunately, came off a little dry. Those biscuits, though, were big and fluffy, and covered in country gravy with a little herby twist. And the breakfast potatoes were more like a potato that had been cut into 6-8 pieces and browned up before being sprinkled with a little flavor. They were darn good, but don't go expecting shreds or little diced cubes.

I ended up finished every bit of my half of the order, and I felt it. That much fried stuff, that early in the day, and you're bound to have problems. Luckily, I just felt full and didn't have any other breakfast drama. This is heavy food.

Next time I want to get the Kool-Aid. I think it's the one on the menu labeled as \"Mason Jar Drank.\" I get it, that's their schtick, and they do it well. It's a fun place to pop in, but it will be a hot minute before I go back. Then again, it will be a hot minute before I eat anything again."}
{"text":"Southern roots, and lots of love goes into the food here!  The chicken is juicy and full of flavor, and they have kool-aid on tap.  : )"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating chicken & waffles and it was weirdly delicious!!! 

I had the Lolo's plate & a side of mac & cheese :)

{"text":"Over priced for Medicor food,   service is really slow,   took 45 mins to get food on a Monday at 11, {and after asking 3 times}  the only thing was good were the names of the food.   Made me lauph for a bit,  but sadly,  that's it.  There's nothing really unique or special about  this place,   service was sub par,  waitreses were air headed,  food was OK,  but not worth the price.  Rather go to Dennys or waffle house and pay alot less for same taste.  Aaaand be able to get it in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Atlanta so I can say this confidently, I know what good soul food is. It can be tough to find this in Phoenix unless it's a home cooked meal from mom haha. 
But LoLo's has some awesome food and it's a great reminder of ATL.
Of course it is southern comfort, so be prepared to wanna take a nap after eating here.
The service is great and It seems like they are always happy to see you in there.
I'm a fan of the cornbread and my go too meal is the \"Tre-Tre's\".
Be careful though, I find the Mac and cheese to be very hearty, meaning it has ALOT of cheese. I know they say that there is never enough cheese but I think this is the exception.
Nonetheless, I'm a big fan of LoLos and I'm always very satisfied when I leave."}
{"text":"Today was my first time there and tge kids and I looooved it. Went cause we wanted grits. We ended up with grits and more. The mimosa was delish"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely fantastic, but their new location loses all of the charm of their old one, it went from a kind of fun, nice place to be and go watch a game on the big screen to being more of a typical restaurant/sports bar, very disappointing. I understand the business decision to get more space, but in the process they lost the atmosphere and it has much less of a 'personal' touch compared to the old place I suppose is how I'd describe it (not to mention the TV's are harder to view so going to watch a game isn't really as good an option as before).

Unfortunately, when I took my father to dinner about a week ago, the service was also very slow, it was at least 10 minutes sitting at the table before anyone came even for drinks, and then the order got messed up and I ended up giving him a piece of my chicken. I won't dock it too much since every other time I've been there (at the old location) the service was very good, so hopefully it was a one-off.

If you have the time, still definitely a good place to go though, as I said, the food itself is what matters most, and it's very good."}
{"text":"OMG this place is delicious!  Now I know why people are always raving about chicken & waffles!  Granted, we went at the worst time possible (lunch time) and it was pretty busy, so we waited a good amount of time.  Our waiter's name was Jesse and he was fairly decent.  Unfortunately, we were seated outside and there were a few instances where I'm convinced Jesse forgot about us.  We easily sat out there with empty glasses for about 30 min at a time.  Granted, the amazing food made up for it."}
{"text":"I totally love this place. First time we went, awesome service, great food! Second time we went, TERRIBLE service. It was horrible. Waitress asked us if we wanted tarter sauce for our fish, we said yes, and she never brought it and when my husband had to walk to the back counter, we FINALLY received it. She then came to us and asked us if \"another girl\" apologized for not bringing it. I hate when people place blame on others. I'll go back but I hope we don't get the same waitress!"}
{"text":"This place is good. Nice atmosphere and friendly servers. The night we went was pretty busy so the service was kinda slow but our nice server definitely made up for that.  Now the food was super yummy! Chicken was right and crispy, mac n cheese super yum and the banana pudding was to die for."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! I'd wish they give larger portions. I ordered the 3pcs Fried Chicken with Mac n Cheese, mashed potatoes and added Collard Greens. All of it was so tasty! My wings were very small though, nonetheless I enjoyed my meal. 

Service at the Bar: was impeccable. I was served by bartender Leanne. Leanne was so attentive and knew the bar well. She throughly multi-tasked and delegated others seamlessly. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Only thing that got them a minus one is the parking situation. They need to figure out something better then valet. Other than that the food was fantastic as always. I know many people have trouble with the service at at Lo Lo in all locations. I was very surprised to have a really good waitress as well. She was very attentive and got all our orders correctly. Almost everyone in my party got a chicken and waffle combo. One of us got rib eye and eggs breakfast. She said it was over seasoned. However, I tasted it and found to be perfect for my palette. Her meat was cooked to order which is always a plus. Never have I had such crispier flavorful chicken. You guys are doing great. Thank you for the awesome food and service."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food with huge portions! I was a little skeptical about eating waffles with chicken but the flavors compliment each other beautifully. I wish the waffles were belgin style but other than that I loved them. They were made with cinnamon and the syrup was amazing. I had the KK (number 1) which also came with grits and eggs. I could have done without them but only because it was so much food. Next time I wanna try the Mac n cheese and collard greens."}
{"text":"Visiting some friends in Phoenix and saw all the great reviews on Yelp for Lo-Lo's.  Any place that includes chicken & waffles in its name has to be able to back that up!

Short version: everything was wayyyy better than we could have hoped for!  Possibly the best friend chicken I've ever had - golden brown and moist & juicy with excellent batter.  The straight-up fried chicken is superb, but I ordered mine \"smothered\" with chicken-onion gravy and it was soooo good.  The waffles are also great - light and flavorful batter with a hint of cinnamon.  And yes, Lo-Lo's proves that chicken & waffles belong together!

Honorable mention: the sides.  We tried collard greens, fried okra, creamy grits and candied yams (some of the best I've ever had).  Not a single wrong order out of a table of 5 on our first visit - doesn't that tell you something?"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about how great the food was at Lo-Lo's downtown location, so was excited to try when I saw they opened a place in Scottsdale. It is by far the best fried chicken I have ever had! The idea of waffels and chicken sounded weird to me, but after trying it~ Im hooked. This place is by far some of the best \"comfort\" food I have ever had. A must try... & my kids love the Kool Aide :)"}
{"text":"Fast and clean service. They didn't have a whole menu and portions were small. The food was thoroughly cooked and very juicy legs. It's a very small review since it's an airport Lolos compared to other ones."}
{"text":"I thought my co-workers were pulling me leg until I actually saw the sign at Lo-Lo's for the first time. Chicken and waffles?!? People do that? It seemed like a cultural tradition I really needed to start embracing.

And if you make the trip and are prepared to wait around an hour in eager anticipation of such a feast, you will be well rewarded for your efforts. It's a converted house without much in the way of seating and usually plenty of people ready to raise their cholesterol levels a couple notches. We've even had several celebrity sightings going there to add to the commotion. As such, you typically wait 30 minutes for a table at lunch time unless you get there early. You will also likely spend an hour or more at the table with the glacial Southern service.

You have to get chicken and waffles the first time you go, preferably with a side and some of their red velvet cake to go. But they have several other unhealthy options and a good amount of breakfast food if that's what your in the mood for. But make no mistake, there is NO healthy option at this place. Don't go there unless you are ready to indulge.

I would also strongly recommend NOT going there with large groups. I see there are 4 votes for \"Good for Groups\" for this place. That is insane. There are hardly any tables and large groups bring the place to grinding halt. Go with 4 or 5 people max."}
{"text":"Stick with the classics - chicken and waffles. The shrimp and grits are way too spicy, fried (despite the menu saying sauteed), and clearly frozen smaller once with the tail still on (makes eating them messy and difficult). The banana pudding rocks."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!! I get the 3 pieces of chicken (3 legs) with 2 sides (fried okra and either green beans or corn) plus 1 cornbread that's delicious! This is wonderful fried chicken and comes out HOT! I usually take home some of this because it's a LOT to eat for $15.  The only negative thing I can say about this place is the parking is horrible! They make you park with a valet, yest it's free, but who wants someone else/stranger to drive your car. Not me! So I park across the street. Also, the Red Velvet cake is delicious!!!!  Go there! It's worth getting to the airport early to eat at that location too!"}
{"text":"OMG! This place is amazing! The food was great the atmosphere was great! Service was amazing! They had trash elevator music on and then changed it upon request. They're overall great people with great food! Love love love! 


My cousin told me they had real chickens in the \"chick'n coop\" and I asked my waiter if it was real. He walked me over to see an empty dining room. We got one hell of a laugh! Thank you LoLos!!!"}
{"text":"I knew when I saw a pimped out neon green DeVille sitting in Lo-Lo's parking lot that this meal was going to be epic.

I went solely for the chicken and waffles, and they more than delivered.  The prices here are much more reasonable than they are at a certain world-famous California-based place, and I'd argue that the food itself is better, too.  The crust on the chicken was light and it was fried perfectly -- crispy on the outside and perfectly tender on the inside -- and the waffles?  Add that to the list of things I could eat all day.  There truly is something magical about a small bundle of fried chicken and a short stack of waffles, drowning in a sea of syrup, butter, and a little hot sauce.  My stomach is growling just thinking about it.

I didn't get to try any of their other stuff, although literally everything on the menu sounded delicious, but then again what soul food dish doesn't?  I went in for a lunch, and other than a kid's birthday party there weren't many people there, so I didn't have any of the long waits or loud guest that apparently plague this location, but I don't know if that would have affected my opinion, because the food was just too good.  

Next time I'm in the Phoenix area, I'll stop by, and maybe I'll get a chance to try some of their red velvet cake...if I can find the room."}
{"text":"I just went there for the second time at this location - having been to the Scottsdale location twice as well.  I like the funky charm of the extremely small old house that appears to have several small (I'm sure not permitted!  :-) additions from over the years!...Oh my god I love this place!  This is what the fried chicken in my dreams tastes like.  I always get the 3 pieces with 2 waffles and it puts me into food bliss state.  The last time I went there was a decent wait outside with the other two dozen people attempting to have lunch - this time was better because it was late lunch - my favorite time anyway!  Awesome, fast friendly service, delicious Kool-Aid, fried chicken with waffles for a late lunch - dream come true experience."}
{"text":"We just moved from Gilbert to Tempe a month ago and I had never been to Lo Lo's. I was so excited to try it as the food combination sounded strange but like it might work well together. The chicken didn't taste bad but like other Yelpers mentioned (at least for the Phoenix location)... it was TINY. And the waffle? Disgraceful. It was so DENSE! Almost like cake. And had a weird taste that neither my mother or I cared for AT ALL. I expected a thick, fluffy Belgian waffle and when it arrived? I was disappointed to say the least. I guess I couldn't tell it wouldn't be what I hoped for when I saw the pictures on the website. And the music.... WAY TOO LOUD. I could not hear myself think in there. Needless to say, I will never go back. I bet iHop has better chicken and waffles than Lo Lo's. Worst waffles ever."}
{"text":"Finally tried this out after reading the reviews. So glad we came, food was great, hot sauce, syrup, fried chicken, waffles, mac and cheese, the amazing cornbread, the drinks, everything was great and went during lunch so it was packed but the server was always on it and making sure we were taken care of even though she had many tables. 

Have to go back to try more of the incredible sides!"}
{"text":"Went on Saturday 12/20/14 for lunch and the 3 of us were seated immediately which was nice, however, we ordered and waited an hour for our food while others around us who were seated after us were being served. Just as we were trying to track down an employee to call a manager to our table after waiting an hour for our food, the server walking towards us had 2 of our 3 plates. We asked him to have the manager come to our table and his response was \"but I have your food here, do you not want it?\". One of my friends stated \"Surely, we will take the food but can you please still have a manager come see us?\". We had no silverware to begin eating and waiting for the 3rd plate. We had to track down another waitress and ask for a manager again as some time had passed and there was still no manager in site, nor the 3rd plate of food. The 3rd plate of food finally came out and we asked for silverware and began eating. Throughout the meal, still no manager. The waiter (Carl) was nice and did come around a few times to ask if everything tasted ok. After we were completely done eating, still no manager. Carl came to the table and stated the kitchen was \"backed up and having issues\" he then stated the assistant manager was the only one working that day and he/she couldn't step out as he/she was assisting the kitchen in getting back on track. He then stated he was able to comp us ($11.00) and apologized for the service. 

As we knew it was not the waiter's fault, we were extremely disappointed in the hour wait, no silverware, and no manager after requesting he/she twice. The cherry on top was the fact that the assistant manager essentially could not come out for a few minutes to speak with a dissatisfied customer. Extremely unprofessional."}
{"text":"Love it!!! Way better than Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles in Cali.. I crave chicken now. I recomend that you dont eat all day before you come becuase the portions are large. Yum"}
{"text":"I'm from The South, where fried chicken is pretty much sacred, so I take my bird seriously. But I can honestly say Lo-Lo's is the best fried chicken in Phoenix. It is everything you need your chicken to be: tender, moist and juicy with a flavorful, crispy crust. Om nom nom.

The other thing I love about Lo-Los is the Kool Aid. They serve it to you in a big 'ol mason jar, and it makes you feel like a kid again. If you want, you can even get a cocktail that's made with Kool Aid. So fun.

Service is good. Food is incredi-balls. The new Scottsdale location has gorgeous decor (major upgrade from the old one!)

Long live Lo-Los and your juicy wonder chicken!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday for lunch.  The music was so loud we walked out before the valet had a chance to move our car.  Why do restaurants in Scottsdale feel they all need to be night clubs?

I prefer dining at places where I can actually talk to the people I am with.  Really disappointing since we drove up to Scottsdale specifically to try LoLo's.

Also the fact that I had to valet was another turn off.

Guess I will stick to eating there when I am traveling through sky harbor."}
{"text":"Great service, food was delicious!! Only reason I give 4 stars is because its a little pricey for chicken and waffles. Parking at the phoenix location absolutely sucks!! Its all valet for 6 whole parking spots and the rest is scattered about the neighborhood streets. Our waiter was the best tho!"}
{"text":"I'll admit, I was a little skeptical when I heard \"chicken and waffles\". It's just a curious combination, especially having grown up in the Northwest. This idea is all new to me.

Then my food arrived. I was no longer a skeptic. I could swear I had a full half of a chicken in my three pieces, and they were smothered in some delicious form of gravy, which I could have just as easily poured straight down my gullet. The chicken was cooked to perfection, as were the waffles. Even having everything mixed together on one plate which could barely contain all of that food didn't deter me one bit.

I do not have a single complaint about this place. Everything was amazing."}
{"text":"A vegetarian perspective:

Lo-lo's Chicky and Wafflin' is like your childhood. Think back to when the world was simple and everything made sense, even if the experience was new. Now we have global warming and a looming ice age and cheap gas and expensive wars and people just not getting along.  

Lo-los is like \"FUCK THAT... drink some cool-aid. But not the cult-spiked kind that will kill you\" And you do. With good friends. Your very best friends. And they eat Mac and Cheese and the skin and legs of things that used to live. And you enjoy the conversation. The people around you say things like \"You may not agree with National Socialism but at least it's an ethos!\"

And you leave and there's a 1965 Pink Cadillac parked out side. And you think of what a DB Travis Barker is... 

Additionally, the waffles are really good. Tasty, in fact."}
{"text":"Nice location! Very well atmosphere and the food was great really fresh! First time trying the chicken and waffles combination in my life and first time at lolos and I totally liked it! Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Wow what a great lunch! I have never had chicken & waffles before and always wanted to try them since it made no sense to me. We went to the location on Buckeye and I was surprised to see how nice the restaurant was. Very clean, modern, well done. Service was great, felt at home right away. The current menu is a bit confusing with many different options but since I knew I wanted to try the chicken & waffles I ordered the Double D. The waiter suggested fried green tomatoes to start, since I have never had those I said yes! They were good too. Then the chicken and waffles came. Soo good! The batter on the chicken is perfect, I wouldn't change a thing! The crunch and spices are great. The flavor of the waffles were perfect and the syrup was not your standard store bought syrup, it added so much. Loved it. My 3 yr old daughter ordered chicken strips and a waffle, she devoured it. Since then she walks around the house saying \"Lo-Lo's!\" and \"I like Lo-Lo's!\". She want's chicken & waffles everyday now and I agree ! To finish our server suggested banana pudding, I expected some yellow jello-o like pudding, but got a gourmet banana dessert again with great flavor, full banana slices and some sort of crust in there that was awesome. It's obvious the chef's taste their food here, I really can't say enough about how well all the pieces tasted together. I will go back for sure, after I ride my bike, jog, or go swimming :) so many more new things to try, collard greens, shrimp & grits, red velvet cake..."}
{"text":"My experience here was great... until about 45 minutes after I ate. I devoured a golden brown waffle, two crispy and moist pieces of fried chicken and still had room for a few bites of buttery grits. On the way back to Mesa in the car, though, it all went wrong. I got super sick from Lo-Lo's chicken, and was holed up in bed for two days on my vacation with all the signs of food poisoning (i'll save you the gory details). 

I will never go back here and recommend staying away from this place, despite the great reviews.  It might be awhile before I can stomach any fried chicken again."}
{"text":"I have never felt so insulted in my life. The menu is full of of stereotypical names and ebonics. The waitress started off by giving us a selection of cool-aid. I was waiting for a black face show and a watermelon dessert menu. Needless to say, I couldn't eat here. I couldn't bring myself to order. I'm sure the food is excellent, but I couldn't stomach foolishness."}
{"text":"They serve Kool-Aid as a \"drank\", y'all. That's just so ghetto, ain't it? As I have waited for flights at Sky Harbor, I noticed this spot before thinking with disgust who in their right mind would wolf down chicken and waffles before a flight? Apparently nobody around me in that food court since everybody else was eating salads and staring at the gluttony about to occur. Now here's a case where what you do in Phoenix may not stay in Phoenix since who knows what would come out of you after the \"Fasten Seat Belts\" light comes on.

So yes, I had a half-hour and a weak moment at the same time and decided to give it a try. What may have not been a great sign is that I had to cajole the server to come out of the kitchen to take my order. He seemed a touch perturbed as he was chatting with the cook. It gave me more time to decide to go full gonzo and order the $14.50 Lo-Lo's Hood Classic. It consisted of three pieces of Southern fried chicken on top of two full waffles in a weak styrofoam container (photo: http://bit.ly/2m6cUi9). Don't judge me.

I was hungry because they didn't serve lunch at my business meeting. It was a huge amount of food as the people around me can attest, but I was disappointed how bland and dry it was once you get over the finger-burning heat of the chicken. The waffles were rubbery and merely acted as a sponge for all the grease (photo: http://bit.ly/2mlCFfa). It was hardly worth the massive calorie intake, and I ended up eating only half of it. My biggest challenge afterward was keeping it down, especially when my plane hit turbulence. Not pretty.

FOOD - 2 stars...big pieces of fried chicken but bland with dry meat and third degree burns when you touch the poultry
AMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...it's the airport...are you serious?
SERVICE - 2 stars...I didn't get a lot of Phoenix love here
TOTAL - 2 stars...Southern by Southwest?...hmmm, not really"}
{"text":"The place was good, but I'm not sure what the hype is all about. The fried chicken was good, but I don't know if it's any better than fried chicken anywhere else. The waffles were pretty good, with the cinnamon adding a nice touch. I wasn't a fan at all of the red velvet cake - it was pretty dry and didn't really have any taste to it at all.

My guess is that the place is famous for being famous - as far as I know, it's the only chicken and waffles place in the valley, so it's going to get notoriety."}
{"text":"I was so excited to eat here that I headed to Lo Lo's directly from the airport. I had 1 waffle with 2 thighs and I added cornbread and fried okra cuz they looked soooo good, but all of it was just average. That being said the food was hot and fresh and that's important to me, so I would eat here again but I'd try something different. The waitress was nice but it took 20 minutes to be seated and there were empty tables, I'm not sure why we had to wait, but eventually they decided to seat people. There was no toilet paper in any of the stalls which was frustrating and unsanitary. Kinda wish I had tried the Scottsdale location. 

Maybe my expectations were too high :/"}
{"text":"This is my third time at a Lo-Lo's.  First time at this location.  I have the same opinion as the first time.  Great service.  Okay food.  Super expensive.  This time I tried the biscuits and gravy.  They were a bit strange.  Huge biscuits with not enough gravy.  The gravy tasted like none I had before and not necessarily in a good way.... Lots and lots of fried breakfast potatoes with it but there was nothing special about them either... quite bland.  The over medium eggs were a bit over cooked but the best part of the meal.

My brother tried the fried chicken and thought it was the best he had ever had.  Wants to go again before he leaves town.  He also had grits that I tried with the butter and they were the best grits I had ever had.

My daughter had ordered chicken and waffles.  She opted for all breast meat chicken and that added $4 to the bill.

My sister tried the coleslaw.  It looked like regular run of the mill coleslaw."}
{"text":"Okay, I am from the south and I have had everything on this menu thousands of times.  The biggest flaw to this place is the waffles.  They are soggy, thin and tasteless!  I imagine if the word  \"waffles\" is in your NAME, they should be better.

Aside from the disappointing waffles, the fried chicken was good, and OMG the eggs were yummily enough all alone!

i don't need all that butter on my grits though......is that because people don't really like grits?"}
{"text":"The food was really really good, but the service was meh. Not impressed with this location ESPECIALLY the valet!! Are you kidding me, valet at a chickena and waffle house? Ridiculous that we would be forced to use it or park across the street at a bank. Well we parked across the street. Not smart on their part. We'll never be back to this location."}
{"text":"Service is not to the same standard as the other locations. For the setup of this location, one would think that the quick order walk up bar implies a faster meal. Nope. The staff should alert travelers who order anything that would take longer than 5 minutes to prepare (like the 'Fat Azz Sandwich') as it's located IN AN AIRPORT. 

After the dry, flat, uninterested girl at the register took our order, she read it back (as she was clearly new, which I appreciated) allowing us to correct her...again. After waiting 10 minutes, we asked about the status of the order and were told the sandwich takes 15 minutes. While our other 2 dishes say waiting... 

Finally, the food arrives... aaaand was incorrect. They swiftly made the change but looked at me like I had 3 heads when I asked for honey. \"No, we don't have honey...?\".The also-frustrated patron behind me said \"you have cornbread, how do you not have honey?\" An employee lingering near the counter/employee door said rudely \"who puts honey on cornbread!?\" (He may have not been a Lolo's employee, his black hat and shirt had white logos. Clearly Lolo's management didn't mid him being there) 

The Joes BBQ looks to be a faster alternative. And they have honey."}
{"text":"Love this place for a really unhealthy but super delicious breakfast every once in a while. If I ate there more than once every few weeks I'd probably be 400lbs but the food is great."}
{"text":"There was a 30 minute wait for a table at 3:30PM. This was due mostly to uncleared tables. I'm not sure what the problem there was as they seemed to have enough staff.

Once seated, everything was great. Our waitress was very nice & the food and beverages came out in a reasonable amount of time. We tried the waffles, chicken & Mac n cheese. All were good. We'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I ate at Lolo's for the first time tonight, and it was great. My friend and I got there at 6pm, prime time on a Saturday night. They got us a table fairly quickly, even after telling us there would be a 25 minute wait. Our waiter was prompt, attentive, and got us our food quickly. I had one fried chicken breast, one waffle, and a side of mac n cheese. All of the food was delicious. The fried chicken is crispy, not greasy, and still moist inside-- basically the perfect fried chicken. My friend and I were both really impressed by the new restaurant. The atmosphere is very lively, and it's a beautiful space. My only complaint is the parking is a little inadequate for how popular and busy the restaurant is. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I would give them 3 1/2 stars. The food was overall solid but not the best. I guess I was expecting a little bit more because everyone in the Phoenix area told me that I needed to go here and that the food was hella good. Don't get me wrong, like I said before the food is solid. The service was really good and the staff was very friendly, real good people. But if you are in the Phoenix area and looking for a home cooked style meal, I would recommend them."}
{"text":"Comparable to Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles in Southern California, Lo-Lo's is pretty good!

Open late with no long waits to be seated especially with a big group, Lo-Lo's is a place to visit in Arizona for some good chicken and waffles. Portions are good, but if you have a big appetite, then order 2. I thought it was cool that they served their drinks in jars. An extra plus for me was that they served Mountain Dew Code Red, and I thought that drink didn't exist in fountain drink options, so totally loved that!"}
{"text":"Overall not impressed with the food at all. If you are going to serve \"Southern Soul Food\" then take it from a southerner from GA, you do not serve dried out, precooked fried chicken. Fried chicken should be cooked to order in a restaurant like this.  Waffles were soggy as though they were precooked as well. While the chicken had a good flavor, white meat was extremely dry and skin wasn't crispy though very dark brown.  Dark meat was more moist but also over cooked on the outside.  Service was average for a restaurant of this style. I probably wouldn't come back on my next trip to PHX."}
{"text":"They have delicious chicken and waffles. They have regular wings not those steroid plumped wings I get at the bar. The drinks come in mason jars. The service was excellent and I will certainly go back. They get very busy but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing! Most people do the Scottsdale location, but you really need to check out this original location ( the 1st LoLo's) and see how it all started. For some reason I think the food taste better here.

Update the 1st local is no more but has been relocated to a new building just a few doors down the street. Also there is now a location inside Terminal 4 at Sky Harbor Airport."}
{"text":"small Lil place very good chicken they have an abundance of sides as well kool-aid to drink lol I guess that's good for kids. Waffles are good I like syrup on the chicken and the waffles but honey is good too on chicken"}
{"text":"I ate lunch here a few weeks ago and it was a nice change from the food you usually find here in AZ. The Kool-Aid and Tea served in Mason Jars was pretty need. I had the chicken tenders and waffle combo and to my surprise, I liked it! The service was good, not great, but good. Portions were large and the food was good quality. I will eat there again for sure."}
{"text":"This place is in Arizona and I'm sad because I live in California.. Let's just say it's better than Roscoes Chicken and Waffles. I feel like a traitor for saying that but gash it's true!!! If you're in AZ, eat here. You won't be disappointed. Still love Roscoes lol"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to LO LOs you are missing out on the yum. This place is clean and always busy. The staff is nice. It's not cheap but it's worth every single cent They have super good sweet tea and kool aid. If you wanna taste what it was like when I was growing up in Mississippi, this is a great place to start. The chicken is fried crispy and so yummy. I like all the sides. This time, my hubby had the classic chicken and waffle and I had a plate where you pick a bunch of sides. It was all good. I went for the grits, and left in love with the okra and Mac and cheese.."}
{"text":"I love Lolo's. If you don't, you need to get right. Their chicken and waffles is amazing and so is their Mac n cheese.  They have a consistent brand, good environment, great staff, and the food is obviously amazing. 

I usually get the Betty Boop and that is plenty of food for me. Their hot sauce they have is made in house and so is their maple syrup. The butter is always on point. 

I like the ambience here because it is modern, family oriented, nostalgic, and a homey feel when I come in. It's a great location with plenty of space for large groups. I love he mason jar theme in the chandeliers and you drink big jars of red kool-aid. They have a special drink list that is phenomenal too. The old fashion is done right. 

They have good music and again a chill atmosphere. It is the best chicken n waffle I've ever had. I promise you, if you want that and more you have to check this out."}
{"text":"The food is good.  You know that already based on the other reviews.

With that said, our experience here was terrible.  Here's how it went down: we arrive, put our name in and wait a very reasonable 10 minutes to be seated.  Once seated, we went through the menu and chose what to order.  10 minutes goes by.  Then 15 minutes - not a single staff member appeared.  We were being totally ignored.  I started checking Yelp for nearby restaurants and planning our escape from what looked to be an impending \"major fail.\"  Then suddenly our waiter appeared and was apologetic.  We were nice in return.  He blamed his slowness on a nearby table that was \"being difficult\" (tacky) and took our drink orders.  Another 10 minutes goes by.  Then 15.  Finally he shows up with our drinks and says nothing - just throws them down.  Weird.  He was having a bad night and we were paying the price.  Before he has another chance to run off, I politely tell him we'd like to get our order in.  He takes our order and runs off again saying very little.  25 minutes pass before he brings out the appetizer.  Then another 20 minutes later our entrees appear.  The whole time he's being as scarce as he possibly can and saying as little as possible every time he appears. Finally whilst eating our food another member of the staff (Susan) drops by and is quite helpful.  She refills our drinks and takes the long-devoured appetizer plate away.  She stops by several times to ask if we need anything.  Good job, Susan!  Unfortunately she turns our table back over to our original waiter who (after another unreasonably long wait) ended up bringing out the check.  He had nothing else to say.  Pretty astounding service for a restaurant that charges $20+/plate (and - based on the mandatory Valet parking - would like to charge more).  As we looked at the final bill at the end of the (long) night, everyone felt cheated by the stunning lack of service.  I'm too nice to stiff someone on the tip, but I came darn close here.

We will not be back.

If you're in the area and need to spend $15-20 for some fried chicken and [carbs], go check out \"Welcome Chicken + Donuts\" instead."}
{"text":"So I absolutely love this place every time I'm in Phoenix we stop there. I was torn between chicken and waffles or shrimp and grits but I broke down and had chicken and waffles with a side of smothered  potatoes.  So good!! Let's not forget the kool-aid  I had the blue mixed with sprite so good. I was stuffed and of course had them fill up my to go cup with kool-aid. I'll be back for my shrimp and grits soon!"}
{"text":"what can i say the staff was very friendly i had the 3 piece of chicken w/collard greens and cheesy grits  had enough for lunch the next day also came w/ big piece of cornbread"}
{"text":"Damn Fine breakfast establishment. After suffering a horrible wait and no food episode at Matt's big breakfast. I drove by Lo Lo's and decided to give em a try. I am so happy I did. I got the coffee and the breakfast sandwich and I'm happy to say I was sat at a table promptly, my coffee was fresh and great, and my sandwich was heaven on earth. It was similar pricing to Matt's and everything was good start to finish. I will return to Lo Lo's for breakfast in the future."}
{"text":"Exactly what you want in a place like this. Classic and Kitschy. The chickens great the waffles were good,cheesy grits were cold. Excellent house drinks like the orange Creamsicle amazing. The waitstaff are impressively friendly and very fun. Not entirely family-friendly. That could've been because we had a very unhappy 11-month-old with us. Will definitely go back no kids next time."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The chicken is amazing, the warm maple syrup and the various southern side dishes are all wonderful. Jake an was our server and he was incredibly attentive, personable and knowledgable. Definitely will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Yum! Order the chicken and waffles. It's what they do and they do it well. The chicken is generally large pieces. Just don't try and get fancy and order a salad or something."}
{"text":"Chicken and Waffles? Who would have thought?

I'm not sure how to sum it up except just a fun little place with great food! The waffles and homefries were my favorite (not much of a fried chicken person, but someone with me said it was good).

They serve Kool-aid, lemonaide, soda, etc...in a big mason jar. It's just that kind of place.

It's a must-do as food goes in Phoenix. It reminded me of the south."}
{"text":"I have to first start out by saying  that tonight was the first time since being in the old building that the service was exceptional. We stopped Coming BECAUSE the service became so $hitty, but they have redeemed themselves tonight. Bianca was on point with our order and the manager was attentive and polite when checking on us. The Mac and cheese must have gone they some type of revival recipe because it's better than the last time I remember ordering it. Should have ordered the greens to see if the flavor has improved too. Husband had the toy toy & I had the Betty boop. Both were cooked perfectly and our plates reflected our satisfaction as we didn't need a to-go box since there wasn't anything to take home. I did notice that the waffle size has changed in size - it's a lot smaller and thinner but still tasty. We just make come back again!"}
{"text":"Soul food!! What can I say, Lo-Lo's does it, and they do it well. You've got to try chicken and waffles at least once in your life. The savory chicken mixed with the syrupy waffle goodness...oooooh! Or, if you've had that experience already, then try Lo-Lo's catfish, mac & cheese, and collard greens. Can't go wrong with that! One bite of those greens and I was immediately transported to a happy place. Oh, and don't sleep on the cornbread either; it's pretty amazing, served piping hot with butter on top. So, yeah, I'm a fan. I'll be back."}
{"text":"If I had a bucket list, then \"Chicken & Waffles\" would definitely have been on it. I really had to try this magical, mysterious combination at least once in my life. The concept intrigued me: the mingling of savory & sweet, dinner & breakfast....

In reality, it was a'ight. I don't know if I'll be in a hurry to have it again...but I'm very glad I did. *Also, the fried chicken at Lo-Lo's is probably THE BEST fried chicken I've ever had (sorry Colonel). So, I may be back to eat some more of that chicken, and also to get some collard greens and Kool-Aid while I'm at it."}
{"text":"I've been to Lo lo's several times and they NEVER disappoint!!! Food and service is excellent as always. I would highly recommend this delicious eatery for anyone. Now if you are looking for so food in the valley there is no comparison. Lo lo's is the best"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles and it's a great place to eat. We had a very nice  server to made sure we had everything we needed. They serve a lot of great tasting food. We had enough to take home for 3 meals. I plan on going back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the chicken and waffles. I got it to go, so the waffles were soggy, but still very good. The hot sauce was a little to heavy on the vinegar for my tastes. Overall I was very pleased. The red velvet cake is a meal by itself.  Very good chicken and very good waffles."}
{"text":"We went in for lunch, food is great. Service is prompt, my server was Chris, good job.
We met the owners nice people, we'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"A must stop!  Chicken is just amazing anyway you get it. Highly recommended, don't just take my word for it try it out yourself. Guarantee you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Not quite as good as Roscoe's in LA, but that would be extremely difficult. Lo-Lo's is still fantastic. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today...brought in my starbucks coffee that I just got to drink with breakfast.  The manager there stopped me and said no drinks allowed in, ok so I had them put it to the side and they placed it on the floor. We ordered breakfast there special waffles and chicken, the chicken was good the waffles sucked, soggy and no great shakes......disappointed.  While I was having breakfast the manager there was drinking her starbucks right in front of me, wow!!!! That made a statement, will never go back there!"}
{"text":"first time coming here heard about this place from a lot of people decided to try it out since I was in the area first off great service the server was very helpful with the menu and also let me try kool aid which was really good was not to sweet just right I haven't had kool aid in a long time I had chicken and waffles the chicken was ok nothing to go home to tell momma about but waffle was actually really good nice place I say try it ."}
{"text":"This pains me to write. 

Haven't been to Lolo's in four of five months. We came in on a Sunday. The place had a totally different vibe. They closed off an entire section of the restaurant and stuffed folks into one half of the joint. I thought, \"this place feels like it is under different management.\"  Funky. 

A look around at who wasn't there told me I wasn't the only one to notice the difference. 

Service was indifferent and inattentive, food was just so-so, no re-fills on drinks offered, and no energy in the joint. 

This was a great place; tonight it was mediocre. Too bad."}
{"text":"If you do not care how clogged your arteries get and have Ok blood sugar then pig out....I would not call this a good Cajun restaurant but it is on the cusp of Cajun.  It is not expensive and a real Cajun would cost more....but health wise....don't do this too often....it is tasty and if you really need a guilt trip...this place will do it for you...kill yourself but not your children, please."}
{"text":"I would eat here everyday if I didn't think I'd end up 400 pounds...

Minus 1 star because each time I've been here the service has kinda sucked and orders have been messed up.

Regardless, their fried chicken on waffles topped with syrup and a slice of Red Velvet cake to top it off......... is sooooooo heavenly."}
{"text":"I was craving macaroni and cheese one day and a friend recommended this place. I wasn't impressed on my first visit, but decided to give it another try. The macaroni and cheese was creamy, but very bland. I think the noodles were a bit over cooked as well. Since the mac & cheese is only a side dish, I ordered a waffle with it. The waffle was thin (not Belgian), dry, and bland. The syrup made it edible, but I still wouldn't recommend it. I ordered some of the blue kool-aide & they must have added a lot of extra sugar to their mix. It was the sweetest kool-aide I've ever tasted before! This could be a good or bad thing depending on how you like your kool-aide. The service was a little better this visit, but I have had my fill of Lolo's and will not be back!"}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles were amazing.  Our server was as sweet as pie.  Clean restaurant nice atmosphere.  Only complaint was the coffee was terrible.  Besides that it was great"}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's offers great food but it's overrated. I personally think the kool-aid was too sweet. I added water and ice to to reach my liking. 

As for the chicken and waffles, pretty good! But I'm not the type who will crave chicken in the morning. Definitely a one or two time experience. Prices a little too high for what it is. Plus, they're always packed  I can get a full a delicious meal at U.S. Egg. Including a mimosa."}
{"text":"I love Lo-Lo's. It is definitely worth the trip to the \"hood\" to sample a bit of their exquisite southern fried decadence. I had the 3 pieces of Chicken Southern Fried w/ 2 side orders & cornbread. I chose the mac n' cheese and sweet potatoes. Everything was amazing. No. Make that \"a-MAH-zing\". The chicken was cooked perfectly--tender and juicy with a crispy coating that had a nice \"pop\" of seasoning. The mac n' cheese actually had cheesy flavor. All too often, restaurant mac n' cheese leaves me wondering \"where's the cheese?\" Not so at Lo-Lo's. The only (only!) complaint I have is the portion size. It was WAY TOO MUCH!  I wish they had a two piece/two side combo, or even a one piece combo. As much as I like fried chicken, I'm really a sucker for the sides. Lo-Lo's does both very very well."}
{"text":"Definitely need to come here!! Even during the peak times, its worth the wait! I first tried the fried chicken thigh, with fries and extra sides, sausage and their corn bread, and I literally died and gone to heaven. Try their cool aide and lemonade but they do use a lot of  sugar so I do always get it watered down and its still soooo good. Eat here once and u will be amazed of how good the food is here. The wait staff is super nice too."}
{"text":"Whoa. Those were some damn good waffles. 

I recommend spooning half of the butter off your grits, cause once it melts there's not room in the bowl for the both of them!"}
{"text":"Went her for supper tonight. We were seated quickly but did set for quite some time wondering who our waitress would be. She was working the tables on either side of us but not acknowledging us sitting there.(the other were wrapping up their meals). So no biggy she apologizes and thanks us for waiting. She gets our drinks ordered quickly and brought back just as quick. Our appetizer took no time at all to come out. FRIED GREEN TOMATOES in January! They were fantabulous! I also ordered a Melon Mojito from the bar and that came out super fast as well. The bar tender even came to the table to see how I liked my drink, which I loved.

Fast forward to food, all of our food came out shortly after we finished our appetizer. I everything I had was great. The chicken and waffles were just great together. I had a wing, thigh, and a breast. All were crunchy and moist on the inside. My kids who are hard to please ate every bite of their chicken strips and waffles. 
My husband got the platter with fish and chicken. His catfish was super juicy and flaky. Though the crust was very crunchy. On point!

My only complaint is how loud the music was. It was like being in a club. But none the less. Great food!"}
{"text":"Apparently, someone was fired from Roscoes Chicken N Waffles in LA, moved to Phoenix, opened their own restaurant, changed the name and a few recipes (not the waffles) and BOOM! Lo Los Chicken N Waffles. Here's my review.

Location: SUCKS. I thought my GPS was malfunctioning when it told me I had arrived at my destination. Hole in the wall shack on the corner of a busy street across from a fenced up empty lot. There goes the ambiance.  

Actual Restaurant: Too small and cramped. Very mediocre looking. Lots of signage written in Ebonics, menu items had ghetto names, Kool Aid flavors (Who puts Kool Aid on a menu and charges $2 for some colored sugar water?!) were Blue Raspberry, Tropical Punch, and Red....WTF is RED?!  

Employees: Cordial. Wouldn't say friendly. One copped an attitude when I told her this place was just like Roscoes.

The Food: I had the Sheedahs Special (1 breast 1 wing 1 waffle) and a side of Mac and cheese. The chicken was very salty. Salt does not equal flavor. The waffle was DELICIOUS. Just like Roscoes. The macaroni and cheese I was appalled by. How dare someone use cream of mushroom soup to make Mac and cheese with! That's a cheap way to make it creamy. I was sickened. 2 bites and I was done.

Maybe I'm just spoiled by Sistahs Soul Food in Long Beach or the REAL chicken and waffles joint who've I've named several times already but I couldn't see what all the hype was about. Lo Los is for people who have Lo Lo standards for soul food apparently. Don't think I'll make the visit again"}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's was decent. After hearing tons of friends rave about it, my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try. 

Just as a FYI, if you're planning on making a stop to Lo-Lo's, be prepared to wait at least 25-30 minutes if you're going on a weekend before 3 pm. But the wait really wasn't that bad.

The service was a little odd. There were several people that were serving us at once. One girl took our drinks, the other took our order, and two others brought us our food-- separately. Understandable considering the high volume nature of the restaurant, but still a little confusing. 

Anyhow, we got out drinks which were delicious. We both got blue Kool Aid mixed with Sierra Mist, as a recommendation of the girl who took our drink order. It was really good and a new twist compared to the Diet Coke that my boyfriend and I always order at other places. 

The food was decent. I got a #7 Toy-Toy with a side of mac and cheese and he got the #3 Lo-Lo's. the first thing to come out was the Mac and cheese. It was pretty good, and seemed to have tiny bits of what seemed to be mushrooms in it which gave it an interesting twist (but I may be wrong!!). Then came the Lo-Los and then the Toy-Toy. They were all pretty decent. The chicken was crispy on the outside but juicy on the inside, however the overall quality was just okay. It was somewhat similar to what you'd get from a Safeway deli. The waffles were pretty good, but were very heavy and hearty and made the meal difficult to finish. 

Service was weird and not consistent, but wasn't notable in a bad or a good way. 

Maybe I'm not a chicken and waffles type of girl, but Lo Lo's was just pretty decent, not great not horrible- just good. I would go back, just not frequently"}
{"text":"They redeemed themselves! Expect delays in ordering, but worth the wait. There were people at about 5 tables and 7 employees just standing around the bar talking. Even though we sat next to the kitchen entrance, waiters passed by us continuously and never stopped to get us drinks or take our order. It was happening to another table and the decided to leave. After about 12 minutes someone came over and asked if we were being neglected. He was an awesome waiter and every waiter in this world should strive to be like him. Friendly, understanding, knew the menu by heart, attentive, all-round great person! Lo-Lo's would have gotten 2 stars from me if it wasn't for him.

We came for the Chicken and only the chicken! He provided us with so many chicken options  for all of us to be satisfied with what we ordered the way we wanted it. He came back in less than 5 minutes with all the chicken. But how? So quick? We had such a variety of pieces ordered. I thought AH CRAP, pre-cooked, reheated, or microwaved! But it wasn't. It was very crispy outside, juicy inside, and the right temperature all around with a really good flavor. We don't know how the cooks did it and the waiter wouldn't tell us. And the Mac'n'cheese is thick and cheesy!!! It was so good!

When the bill came, my meal was missing. I called him over and told him the check was wrong and missing my meal. He said not to worry about it since we were neglected and wanted to make up for it. I said it was alright, the chicken made up for the wait. He insisted though. Next time we are in Scottsdale we will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"ok its Lo-Los and yes on any given day it great and will keep coming back
the new building seats more people , just missing the old days"}
{"text":"Chickens so goood! and crispy!  even my mama likes it!"}
{"text":"I am quite upset with my most recent visit to Lo Lo's. My review went from 5 stars back in May 2013 to 2 stars, the 2 stars are for the customer service only. 

When I first came to Lo Lo's in May of this year, the chicken was big and delicious. So My husband and I came back today and I think we got the Cornish Game Hen  order. I ordered 2 legs and 1 wing, as you can see on my picture, the legs are about 4 inches long and 2 inches wide. My husband ordered 3 wings and from tip to base it was about 5 inches long. For anyone that's a fan of Lo Lo's, the legs are about 6 inches long and 3-4 inches wide full of meat.

I was clearly upset and I've told my colleagues and friends that goes to AZ for business and vacation of my recent visit to Lo Lo's and to watch out for my review.  My husband told me that we should go back to Lo Lo's before we go back to Los Angeles but I was too upset."}
{"text":"Lo Lo chicken and Waffles will be removed from my \"places to eat while traveling\" list forever.  The first one I went to was in Scottsdale, I happily gave it 5 stars and told my friends and colleagues about this place and that Lo Lo's is a must visit.  A couple of months later, I went back again and OMG!!! What happened???!!!! I got the game hen version.  The drumstick was 4\" long and not even 2\" wide (I've posted pictures) so wrote a scathing review considering I looked at the other people chicken and it was twice the size of what me and my family got!  

So my husband and Are in AZ for the next couple of days and I decided to let Lo Lo's redeem themselves.  We went to the Lo Lo's on Central Ave. AlI can say is that Lo Lo's have been removed from my list!"}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles, whoever came up with this combination is a genius in my book. Lo Lo has definitely perfected this craft. 

The chicken was crunchy on the outside and oh so moist and juicy in the inside: definition of the perfect fried chicken. Waffles were not too big or sweet:  perfect balance to the saltiness from the chicken.

This was my first time having shrimp and grits. Let me tell you if this is how it's made then it's my new favorite dish. Grits was cooked just right. Shrimp was well seasoned and not over cooked.  The sauce on top had bacon, mushroom and spinach. This was a great meal. I'm already salivating dreaming about it.

I had the pink lady which was a great refreshing cocktail for a hot afternoon. You can't go wrong with grape kool aid either. 

Staff was great! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I go strictly for the food. Not for the service. It's too bad because the combination of waffles and chicken is very tasty. I randomly decide to come here but it's always 80 percent satisfaction. The hostess staff and majority of servers seems like they hate their jobs and are never anywhere to be found. The hosts will seat you at a table half clean. There can be food covering the bottom floor under a booth and expect you to scoot into that mess. Tabled are wiped down with filthy towels which freaks me out. Again I go for the food. Wish they had a management swap or something that hires people who have work ethic. Would be a 5 star"}
{"text":"First timer at Lolo's. Positives: food is delicious and servers were very friendly. Negatives: no baby changing station and they were out of coffee, pepsi, and cherry pepsi. When I said I'd just go grab a coffee at Starbucks, the server said no outside food was allowed. No response from him when I pointed out they should have coffee/cola, especially on a Sunday morning. They also said no to-go orders were allowed, but were gracious enough to give us a box so we could package it up.

Might return, in hopes that they can get their coffee pot fixed and soda refilled. Scottsdale is out in the middle of nowhere, after all. Replacements are hard to find."}
{"text":"The place was packed when we arrived and we were seated within five(5) minutes. The service,atmosphere, and food was exceptional!!! When in Arizona this is a must visit!!! Soul food joint...LOL

Happy Feelings!!"}
{"text":"What is this place?!!!! AMAZING. My boyfriend took me here and I was blown away. I spent the first 20 minutes ogling everyone's food. The best fried chicken I have ever had and the waffles are insanely delicious. I also love how they serve drinks in mason jars. 

The service is scattered as others have mentioned but everyone is really nice. Our food came out quickly enough and was perfect. 

This isn't a quick place to eat, set aside about an hour on a weekend morning. 

Definitely will be back and it's a shame I don't live closer otherwise I would eat here more often."}
{"text":"I would never recommend that you visit here on a Sunday.  We waited 3 plus hours for our food.  Management needs to look at revamping the scheduling for additional staffing needs. When our food arrived it was cold we had to send back a waffle due to it being undercooked.  I won't be returning here. Very unsatisfied and management didn't even come to our table to address our concerns. Quality of the food was not worth what we had to pay $86 plus dollars.  Going to Jack N Box would have been better."}
{"text":"THREE TIMES IN ONE WEEK because I craved this place. I want credit for trying! bisquits and gravy YUM! Chix strips and fried snapper YUM. Fried Chicken Yum! But when Waffels is in your name, come on! YUK Thin pale and raw or almost raw!!! Twice!!!!
 I get it nobody makes a waffels like my mom did, it was enough to wake me (for real) so I am spoiled. However Thin might be there \"style\" but raw is inexcusible.
Service is always GREAT & FRIENDLY, but my cravings have wayned.
I will be back but you lost me on the waffle part, thank goodness almost everything eles from the kitchen is great!"}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's has been updated and I like the new restaurant. It's more spacious. Easier to get around in, more items on the menu and it looks great inside!

Fried Green Tomatoes! Oh my goodness! They were the special appetizer. And man, were they good! I tried the sauce, but I liked them better without it. They were tart and the paprika added such a great flavor to them that four wasn't enough.

The chicken and grits were fantastic as always.

My absolute favorite thing on the menu is the macaroni and cheese. I eat it like dessert. I could get just that.

Lo-Lo's is one of the main things that I miss in Phoenix. We eat here almost every time we pass though."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm not from Phoenix, but I get it. It's not the same as their main location in town, the service might be subpar (which I didn't experience), and it might take a while to get my food, BUT THESE ARE SOME DAMN GOOD CHICKENS!!!!

The $19 price tag for my whole combo is a bit excessive, but considering it's at an airport, I'll take this any day over the $12 refrigerated turkey sandwich with wilty arugula at SFO.

Thank you PHX, and thank you Lo-lo's, for making my 3-hour transfer so fat and so enjoyable."}
{"text":"Loved it!

It's what you expect - friend chicken and waffles. The menu has all types of different combinations, though, and good side options. I would opt for the chicken breast instead of the thighs or drumsticks, because it's all bone-in chicken and you get the most meat off of a breast. The waffles are good too - they're not too thick, and they have a cinnamon-y flavor to them. I got sides of cornbread and gravy (each $1). And the best part? The drinks (referred to as \"jar of drank\" on the menu) come in big mason jars. 

The service was great, friendly and fast. Prices were good - I think my meal, which was a lot of food and included a drink, was about $15 including tip."}
{"text":"I've been to Lolo's numerous times. I prefer the south side location as it feels more authentic but don't me wrong... this location is much appreciated, as well. It's more convenient for me since it's closer to home, very close to my work and they stay open later, especially on Fridays when they stay open until midnight.

You can't really go wrong with anything here. I usually stick to the chicken and waffles. Get some gravy on the side for smothering your chicken, yummy. Their catfish is good, too. It has a cornmeal batter. For sides, their mac and cheese, greens and home fries are my favorites.  For drinks, I love their sweet tea. They also have a lot of variety of Kool Aids for those of you who like that. 

This location is larger and nicer given that it's a newer location. Service is always friendly. Prices are on par for what you get. 

I'm originally from LA and I'll admit, It's better than Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles!"}
{"text":"Do you like fried chicken? Yes? Do you like waffles? Yes? Go to Lo Lo's or reconsider your life lol"}
{"text":"Maybe I am missing out since I don't eat Chicken but I just don't get it.

We arrived for lunch at 11:30 and had to wait outside for a table.  Once we had a table the menu was simple combos of chicken parts, eggs grits and waffles. Choose your combo and it has a number and a name.

I had the Nay Nay $8 2 waffles 2 eggs and grits.  The waffles were nothing special at all and a bit under cooked in my book. The eggs were just eggs and the grits were soaked in butter and flavorless. If I am going for a hear attack at least I want to enjoy the taste, or get good value. 

My co workers also got a jar of kool-aid, this a diabedic shock inducing concoction that is so sweet it is viscous $2.50 with refills. 

I say go to say you tried it and that is about it."}
{"text":"Went hearing great things about this place. The food was amazing. Best chicken and waffles I've had. The service though wasn't the best. I had to ask multiple people for cutlery and napkins. When we got there they forgot we were waiting for a table for 20 mins even though it wasn't busy. The chairs were not nice and very hard. The food is the reason for 3 stars."}
{"text":"First time having chicken and waffles and it was amazing! Came to this location on a Monday night so there was no wait and food came out quick. There was a miscommunication and it took us a little while to get greeted but other than that everything was perfect. Althena realized we haven't been helped and took care of us. I ordered the lo lo chicken and waffles, girlfriend got the al maiden. Over all great food, service and experience. Will definitely come back and try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable!!!  If you go make sure you ask for Jacquan!!!  He is so great, so sweet...  He remembered us and our order from months earlier!  The food is incredible!  Can't go with out getting the chicken and waffles!  The ribeye breakfast was awesome! And that cool-aid... Best I've ever had in my life!!!"}
{"text":"The food itself was good. The only thing I didn't like (that's been mentioned previously) is the fact that the food isn't brought out at the same time. Our party of 6 each had their plates at different times so the first person that had theirs was well into their meal by the time the last person received theirs. Also there's a price difference that isn't mentioned. I had the Aunt Hattie's Salmon Croquettes, which were listed as $12 on the menu, but came out to $15 on the bill. $3 isn't a lot to some, but it's enough to make a difference. At least now we can say we've been."}
{"text":"We had heard of this place ever since we moved downtown two years ago and we finally got to try it out. We walked there, but if you drive make sure you have some cash on you because the only parking is valet. It's free, but you'll want some money for a tip. We went at the perfect time, a weekday during brunch hour. If you go at any of the popular times to eat, expect a wait. The food is delicious. Definitely try the signature chicken and waffles, they are great. The chicken has a great seasoning and the waffles are thin and cinnamony. The omelets are huge and delicious! My only complaints are that it is way too loud inside and a but overpriced."}
{"text":"First time visit and boy, I'm disappointed! Ordered fried pickles for an appetizer and it took 35 minutes to receive an appetizer! For for our main dish, we ordered chicken fried chicken and it was cold when it arrived. Most frustrating moment: when I spoke to the waiter he stated that since \"we cut ate the chicken we might not get a new one\". Ugh! Where is the policy of \"the customer is always right?\" I'm sorry, Lo-Los we won't be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  A friend had eaten here and said it was decent.  From my perspective it has so-so food and very high prices for what you get.  I got the Betty Boob which is a chicken breast and a waffle.  The chicken was dry and the piece quite small... I've had wings with almost as much meat on them than this breast had.  The coating was nicely browned but not particularly flavorful, average at best.  The waffle was terrible, dry, overcooked and tough.  I've made better waffles at the Free Breakfast bar in motels.  This tiny meal cost me $8.  For that price one side should have been included.  But the sides were extra, such as $4 for a side of mac and cheese.  There are far better dining options then this including Denny's.  On the plus side, the waitress was very good."}
{"text":"This is the ultimate splurge.  A couple of fried chicken and thick buttered waffle with syrup...I need a nap.  Don't forget the 24 oz Sweet Tea, Kool Aid or Lemonade for added sugar overload.

Even before I took a sip of my sweet tea, hubby knew it would be too sweet for me.  He gave me his unsweetened tea...he's all the sweetness I need.  My little cutie pie's lemonade was bigger than his head.  It was a crack up to see how his eyes got big by the sight of his towering favorite drink.  He decided on the chicken strips and french fries he could barely finish.

The well seasoned, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside chicken leg and thigh topped the buttery waffles.  My hubby is a breast man, so that topped his waffles.  I'm not too crazy about the greens on the side.  I've had better.  I so wanted to try the Red Velvet Cake, sadly, we didn't have any room for it.  I had to be rolled outta there.

I'm craving for some while writing this *slurp*"}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles is located in an upscale hipster location on Central Avenue just south of downtown Phoenix. The restaurant is large with decent free parking.

The menu is straight up soul food with lots of fried and smothered options. I opted for the Sheeda's Special which included a breast, wing, and one waffle. The food was delivered very fast combined with a large jar of unsweet iced tea.

My chicken was juicy and cooked well, although the coating had a bit too much flour. It was seasoned well and complimented the house hot sauce at each table. The waffle was large and fluffy with a nice cinnamon flavor and plenty of butter and syrup.

Lo-Lo's is a popular and fun option for those wanting to broaden their comfort zone for some good comfort food."}
{"text":"We actually went to the one on Scottsdale and Indian School. YUM OLA. What fun, delicious food!

Waffles were yummy and paired with juicy, chicken, cooked just right. Great pricing at $7. Casual, lively atmosphere. Can't go wrong for a quick, easy bite. 

Super FRIENDLY service. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is always poppin' but it's worth the wait. On a Friday night, place filled inside and outside, it only took about 5 minutes for my mom and I to get seated. Our waitress was so sweet and attentive from the get-go. I wish I caught her name because I'd give her a shoutout. Anyways, you must must must get the restaurant staple - chicken & waffles. The menu has an array of different combination options (ex. Lolo's: 3 pieces with 1 waffle, etc.) and you are sure to find the one that best fits your craving. I almost ALWAYS go with the Lil C. It comes with 2 pieces of chicken (legs/thighs) and a side of mac & cheese OR beans. The mac & cheese is a MUST HAVE!! And if you are into gravy and don't mind a .50 extra charge, order your chicken \"smothered\" and your chicken will indeed be smothered with their succulent gravy and grilled onions. In my opinion, this definitely hits the spot! However, during my most recent experience here, I decided to order the salmon croquette for a little change. There are several options for salmon croquette (salad, breakfast plate) but my server helped me decide on the salmon croquette platter which comes with TWO sides AND cornbread! I was so excited that I was able to get my favorite mac & cheese and buttered corn for my 2nd side. I'll be honest that the salmon croquette didn't excite me much. It was a tad dry and not as flavorful as I hoped. A 3/5. But my sides were still wonderful. My mom and I saved room for dessert this time and oh my goodness. Their bread pudding is OH SO GOOD! Just the right amount of sweetness and a wonderful bottom crust. It comes with a mixed berry sauce and a little bit of vanilla ice cream. It made my night. Lolos is one of my most favorite local restaurants, hands down."}
{"text":"This is no Roscoe's chicken and waffles. They also do not have AC inside this place. You are warned if you come here during the summer. I ate here in 115 degree weather and it literally destroyed my meal. All I did was down fruit punch. I couldn't enjoy my chicken and waffles. The food isn't bad here it's just bad to eat here in the heat. Please ADD some AC and I'll return here."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great prices, food comes out fast, nice chill vibe.. And perfect chicken and waffles..."}
{"text":"I've been to Lolo's several times now but this was my first time there this year. I had some friends visiting from LA and they wanted to try it since I always brag about how it is waaaay better than the infamous Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles. lol. 

A friend and I shared a soulfood platter. It was 3pcs of smothered chicken w two sides (we had mac n cheese & beans over rice). We had the gravy on the side and added a side of waffles. It also came with a peice of cornbread. I had the sweet tea to drink. The chicken and waffle were still as good as ever. The sides however were not very. Our mac and cheese was really mushy! The flavor was good but the pasta was way overcooked. It almost looked like a bowl of yellow custard. The beans and rice also had great flavor but the rice was a bit undercooked. The cornbread was better than I remembered. I noticed they changed their gravy also. The color is different... more golden than before with little specks of something red. It used to be a light brown gravy with peices of wilted onions. While still good, I liked the old version better. The sweet tea was a little sweeter than normal but I still enjoyed it.

My friends agreed that the sides could've been better but really enjoyed the chicken and waffles. They enjoyed it so much that they wanted to go again before their trip back home. We went the next day to the Scottsdale location and picked up a plate of chicken and waffles from them to bring on the road. lol."}
{"text":"First time at Lo-Lo's chicken, too bad they don't have any locations in San Diego, else I'd be a regular. Ordered of course the Lo-Lo's special has two nicely prepared waffles and three pieces of fried chicken.  The chicken was crispy on the outside juicy on the inside, definitely not greasy.  Jaquan was our server and was very attentive. 

Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"I've been hesitant to review Lolo's. I know everyone creams their pants upon its mere mention, but I really don't. I don't like fried chicken at all, and I'm generally too hungover in the morning to eat anything besides a gallon of gatorade, so I was afraid my review might only be relevant to a specific audience. Namely: Me.

But I wanted to review the Scottsdale location since I just went last weekend and have also been to the Phoenix location, so I figured the differences between the two might be worth pointing out. They both have good food, endearing servers, and awesome atmosphere. The differences are subtle, but noticeable. For instance, at the Phoenix location you get an ice cream scoop of warm, melty butter on your waffle. At the Scottsdale location you get a spoonful of cool, hard butter. I realize that waiting 5 minutes would solve this problem, but who has time to wait while there is a delicious breakfast pastry sitting right in front of your face?

Basically, everything was just a little different. Though this may have been in part because Coda B. and I split a 3 piece and he stuck me with the thigh.  Bastard.  He liked the grits better here but again, I liked them better at the other location.  Main reason: Not enough butter. I am in a race against time and if you think I'm going to die as a 95 year old healthy person you have another think coming. All of my decisions shave years off of my life, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

They did have an awesome little gospel band there because it was Sunday. So I left feeling that much closer to God. And not just because I felt like i might have a cholesterol induced heart attack at any moment. 

I would say if you're not generally a fried chicken fan, I don't think Lolo's will blow your mind. If you want an awesome breakfast experience go to the Lolo's in Phoenix. If they're too busy, come to this one."}
{"text":"I have waited to post a review because I wanted to have an appropriate amount of experiences before commenting negatively on the establishment. First of all, there is no convenient parking unless you valet (which is free) or self park a ways away. Secondly, every time I have been there the service has been less than mediocre. The most recent time the server took forever to approach us, did not check on us once, and forgot one of our ordered items. While I want to like the food, each time I have been less than impressed. I will say that the atmosphere is really cool but the atmosphere does not compensate for the terrible service and lackluster food."}
{"text":"So I am a huge fan of the combo of fried chicken and waffles mix up.  Created by culture and probably enjoyed by us food deviants and Bud users in hunger munchie mode. The wait was bad here. At least 20 mins for drinks and 30 for dinner. We didn't wait to sit though. Service was good. Kitchen sent out meals all at different times. That's sucks when you are in a group.  I think it was because the chicken is so damn fresh and cooked per order. Got the LoLo and it was the best chick and waffle combo I've had.  Chicken breading just right.  Good spice and the LoLo hot sauce makes it steller.  Waffle is so on point.  I'd smash that with or without chicken.  It was fluffy. Touch of sweet. Tad of vanilla and cinnamon. Delicious.  Oh they serve breakfast too all day.  Wish I lived closer to keep trying other menu items.  This is going to be our pregame eat and booze place before sporting events for sure!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for a while now,and this has to be the best chicken I ever had beside the waffles.they batter is thin,sweet and crsipy with no skin.there sweet tea and lemonade makes a perfect arnold palmer.thet kool-aid will send you into a sugar comma.so good.roscoes ain't got sh*t on this place,everything is classic soul food with a twist thanks to his mommas breakfast and brunch house,\"miss whites golden rule:it is a must eat spot,top on my az list,if you don't know know .now ya know,quality at its finest,stay classy yelpers"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken best everything is consistent and hot and fresh ! Love the okra sweet tea kool aid candy sweets  Mac and cheese so yummy"}
{"text":"Uncrowded when we went. I advise the boob and a blanket, more than a boob is too rich. And I LIKE fried chicken, alot.
Well executed and delicious. Fair prices."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to this place for years. They recently opened up the new building and it is beautiful! I'm not a fan of Kool-aid but it's a must have here, the blue \"flavor\" is EVERYTHANG!! I usually get the soul food platter, comes with chicken, 2 sides (mine are mac & cheese and greans) and a big azz stupid sized piece of cornbread. If you have high blood pressure or clogged arteries I wouldn't recommend this place to you. You'll definitely be eating good in the hood here but if you come at night carry a blade in your purse. ;-)"}
{"text":"I love the signature Chicken & Waffles, always cooked to perfection. Great atmosphere and kid friendly."}
{"text":"So I finally got to visit Lolo's to see if they were as good as everyone said they were. It was pretty busy, which is not uncommon as I am sure that it is always busy. I got seated pretty quickly because I was dining alone so kudos for me. I was quickly approached and asked for my drink order which was red kool-aid of course! WOW can we say sweet. I forgot how sweet kool-aid could be as I haven't had any in YEARS. But it was good though and brought back some great childhood memories. 

My next challenge was trying to decide what in the world I wanted to eat. So many choices. I had changed my mind about 4 times by the time the waitress came over to me. I wish I had gotten her name because she was very friendly and not overbearing. Me likey. Anywho, I decided to go big and order the KK, which is 3 pieces of chicken, 2 waffles, grits, and 2 eggs with cheese and onions. So after about 20 or so minutes, my food arrived and let me just say my eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach. 

First off the grits, now those ain't no instant grits! They came in a little bowl with a BIG gob of butter. Man they were so good. I had to move all that butter off to the side as it was a huge mound, but the grits were hot and oh so good. I had to add sugar to mine as that is how I like them and that make it even better. 

The eggs were good. Just scrambled with some cheese and onions. Standard. Nothing fancy about them. Nice and hot. 

Now on to the chicken. While the skin was nice and crunchy, it was a little salty for me. But between the sweet kool-aid it balanced out after awhile. Not bad, not bad at all. 

The waffles were good, but I was slightly disappointed. I think mine were a little too soft. I like them just a tad bit more crunchy on the outside but still soft. Kinda hard to explain, but they were not bad at all. They too came with a big gob of butter. I swear, I wonder how much butter do they go through each day let alone each week and year! 

I ended up only eating part of my grits, all of my eggs, one piece of chicken and half of a waffle. All the rest came home with me for a snack later. 

The ambiance of the place is nice, but I do wish the little flat screen TV that they have in the upper left corner was bigger and more centered. It seems so lost in that wide open space that they have. I also wish they had at least two stalls in the bathroom as there was about a 10 min wait for the ladies room. Other than that, not all bad. But know that if you are in a group and it is busy, you will have wait to be seated and the food takes awhile so be patient! Oh also know that if they are really busy, they will stop any take out orders. I witnessed people being turned away who were there for take-out only. I also watched as all the workers repeatedly washed there hands after handling just about any and everything. I saw my own waitress wash her hands about 5 times in the course of me sitting there. Very nice!!! (May sound like a weird comment but its good to know that they are hygienic)"}
{"text":"Was in town for business and was craving some major Southern food. I'm from Nashville so I have pretty high expectations for Southern and this place delivered. Got a chicken finger plate with mac n cheese and home fries. Thought the food was really good with the exception of the cornbread which was a little bit dry. Service was friendly and fast even though they were packed. Its a ton of food and the price is pretty decent. Would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"We go to Soul Food restaurants all over the country. We were told this was great..... it is over rated! The red beans tasted like they had bbq sauce in them. The mashed potatoes had hunks of onions, no good! The Mac & cheese wasn't creamy enough! And the catfish crumbled too much. At least the fried chicken was good as well as the cornbread muffins. They need to improve their sides & it will make a huge difference! And I've been in the restaurant business for over 15 years too so I know delicious food!"}
{"text":"Good luck finding a table for this place on a Saturday or Sunday morning.  We tried to get in twice while my family was in town and had to come back a third time during their off hours to finally get a table without an hour wait.  In my opinion, it was worth it because of the  wonderful biscuits and gravy, great fried chicken, and excellent collards.  Lo-Lo's is definitely one of those places where you eat and worry about the consequences from the calories later.   So if waffles are your thing, and chicken is your thing, then you need to eat here.  Simple as that."}
{"text":"When I went, it wasn't too busy but it took awhile for the waitress so take our order and retrieve our sauce. I would understand if it was busy but that's not a big inconvenience in the long run. The chicken was moist and juicy. It was good by itself, but not combined with the waffle since that took away the taste. The waffles were just... waffles. There wasn't anything special about the two together, but that may be because I never really was into the chicken and waffle craze. Parking was a bit difficult to find because it is right next to a hotel and a lot of the spots are reserved, but after circling a few times, we got lucky and found one."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I'll start by saying that the food is great.  It's the only thing that makes it worth it...

However, some of their rules are annoying.  First, they wouldn't seat a table of 7 when 6 people were there and the 7th is almost there.  \"The whole party needs to be in the restaurant.  Rules are rules\" the hostess says.  That's ridiculous, rules are not absolute and this one should be taken on a case by case basis.

Then, the server tells us you can't do food substitutions and you can't split checks on a party 6 or more.  Lazy.

You can have it your way at Burger King but apparently not at LoLo's."}
{"text":"Considering I don't eat chicken with waffles, this place was okay. Came for lunch during bike weekend and of course it was crowded. The wait was at least 30+ minutes. It was hot so I was glad there was a sitting area on the outdoor patio. 

As for food, I ordered catfish and fries. Catfish was fried perfectly on the outside. It was a bit too soft on the inside for my liking, but still good and edible. The fries were hot and seasoned well. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone with high blood pressure. Our waitress was very helpful. Though, several different people brought out food for our table of 7 and orders got a little mixed up.

This was a good place to try while out of town, but nothing I would run to if there was one to open in my home city."}
{"text":"We had a split party that was taking our Mom out for her birthday. After being seated we were asked about our party. We told them we had 3 more joining us. They then proceeded to tell us that we would need to go back out to the lobby and wait for our whole group. We told them that we've already been seated and they didn't care. They then also told us that if there weren't enough chairs that some of our party would either have to wait in the lobby for more seats to open or sit in another part of the restaurant. We verified that we were understanding them correctly and when we found out that we were we told them we are leaving and going somewhere else. Not interested in giving money or business to someone with that low of a customer service level."}
{"text":"What a perfect treat after a strenuous cardiovascular workout?! This Phoenix secret is definitely on my list of restaurants to visit again. Just don't eat here too often as the fare is high in carbs and saturated fat. The food is served hot out of the kitchen as soon as it's ready, so there is little wait time. It's a good idea to remember your order number and meal name as the person bringing out the order probably won't be your server. Although the service was rushed, it's what I expected from a busy, family-owned restaurant on a Sunday morning. 

Before a table was clear, I was reminded of waiting outside to be seated at a popular restaurant in New York City in the chilly winter wind and snow, expect it was a warm fall morning and we were definitely not in Manhattan. The decor was minimal, but clean and finding the place took some extra effort (if you are coming from the north on Central its right after Buckeye and there is no sign). For a taste of the Southeast right in the middle of the Southwest, stop in at LoLo's, fo' sho'."}
{"text":"Wow what a waste of money. Waitress and hostess were very pleasant.  They were highlight of visit.  Food ugh.  Will not return unless someone says they have new management  and cooks.  According to reviews food and services were excellent.  My first hint that this may not be true was lack of diners at 5:45 PM on a Tuesday.  I shoukd have left or not gone in.  There was more employees than customers.  I guess that is why dinner cost $20 with 2 sides.  
The 2 pieces of chicken (thighs) sat in grease on plate,  were dry, dark brown  (over cooked my guess), tasteless (no seasoning) ,  not  acquainted with this type of  Southern cooking.  Usually very tasty.  I ordered 2 thighs and was given leg and thigh.  Waitress exchanged by taking plate and then returning with thighs and spilt grits on plate.  Looked very unappealing.   The grits were warm and not hot enough to melt butter.  They lacked taste even with butter. My school cafeteria makes better.  Mac and cheese  staple was made with melted Velveeta.   More cheese than pasta and needed salt and pepper to even have an acceptable taste.  Again this is not seasoned  Southern Cooking.  The highlight was the greens - excellent.   Tasty and cooked to perfection.  Was not given cornbread.  I guess it would have cost more.   But as I said at beginning will not return until there is a change."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Food was mediocre and service was slow. This is a southern place and the chicken gravy was brown!!! Meh."}
{"text":"Crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside was my first impression of my fried chicken and the waffle with syrup was a nice accompaniment - adding a dash of Lo-lo's hot sauce was just the right touch. I also had a side of collards - sooo delicious!"}
{"text":"The chicken pieces were very small and the batter no better than Church's imo.  The waffles were more like pancakes with maybe nutmeg and cinnamon; I'm guessing.  I have had so much better that I can't take this place seriously.  There are better places in town so I'd ship this one folks and save the $15."}
{"text":"Best PhatAss Chicken Sammich eva! Kool-Aid on tap. I rave about this place, definitely in my top must eats"}
{"text":"Food was great. It did get crowded at noon. Waitress was cranky. They have a small area outside but it was too hot to eat outside. Inside, the environment is light and happy aside from our waitress."}
{"text":"Dang it Lo-Lo's!!! This food was so good I had to take a photo and tell my wife!!! Considering I am on a diet, that says allot!! The service was impeccable and the atmosphere was so chill. We will definitely be back on every trip we make back to Phoenix!! I will just be sure to show up on cheat days lolol."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this chain for years. Until the prices started getting high. I remember when the soul food platter was $13.50 now it is $17. I came here with my 1 yr old and my 13 yr old, we waited over an hr for our food. The people next to me came in after me, and got their food before I did and left as we were getting our food. Finally my food came out it was warm not hot freshly waiting for hr made. The chef came out and said he would take care of my bill. The waitress brought me my bill... he only comp'd the drinks. Never again."}
{"text":"Yummm! If you haven't been you must go. Wait times can be long during lunch so plan accordingly.  But don't worry, it's worth the wait! And try the red velvet pancakes!"}
{"text":"Finding the idea of chicken and waffles very intriguing and being almost as big of a syrup lover as Will Ferrell in Elf, I had to give Lolo's a try upon finding out it was in my backyard. 

I went with two friends at lunchtime on a Thursday and the place was packed. While they seem to still be figuring out the service (we were \"forgotten about\" several times), the food was excellent. 

I had the Betty Boop - chicken breast and a waffle, both of which were delicious. I was not disappointed with the syrup either. We shared a few sides - mac and cheese, fried okra and greens. The greens were really delicious, slightly spicy and full of flavor. The mac and cheese was not bad, the fried okra nothing special. 

All in all, a great atmosphere, good comfort food and I think this new location will do really well, esp. if they decide to stay open late and cater to the \"must sober up\" crowd."}
{"text":"Had a really great lunch here.  The place was really busy, but service was still pretty fast.  The food portions are GIGANTIC and you can't leave this place hungry.  Prices are in line with the quality and huge portions.

The fried chicken is excellent, as was the cheese and grits."}
{"text":"I can't think of a reason not to like this place. 

Food and service were excellent, and I saw a placard stating this is one of the top 50 restaurants in Arizona. My bf and I agreed that the waffles were one of the best we've ever tried. 

The yelp app lets you get on the wait list with an estimated wait time. 

The bathroom goes above and beyond with signs telling you to approach management if they could improve on something.

The menu is hilarious. Dishes will be called things like \"nay nay\". Drinks are called \"dranks\" here, and the music is great.

Overall, good vibes."}
{"text":"By far the best service I have ever received in Phoenix - and I am a frequent high end diner. It was like being in the South where hospitality and a smiling face is like a law. And the food: fattening wonderfulness that truly delivers exactly what they promise. If you're looking to indulge (or find some authentic grits) I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Nice location, good service.  Waffle was ok, chicken WAY over cooked ... Dry dry dry. Sad.  Others mentioned the same.  Next."}
{"text":"Shitty place shitty customer service people hear don't know how to provide customer service then they bring cold food to the table like get the hell out of here with that ."}
{"text":"A visit to Phoenix is not a visit to Phoenix without a stop here! Great food, good people, fast service. I just wished they opened earlier!"}
{"text":"The concept is great. I went in with great expectations which were dashed to bits before we were seated. I took my team out to lunch and we had to wait almost one hour to get seats, but it turned out that poor communication on the waitstaff end worked against us and we ended up spread across three tables - WHY??? 

No sooner did we get seated that we were told they were busy (I could tell) and we should either hurry up and get our order in, or wait for the next waitperson, since our waitress was leaving for the day (in the middle of lunch rush hours). Someone came by and wiped our table clean, because it was still filthy from the last customers. We got drinks - cool Ball 1 liter glass jars - loved it, but the \"Cool-Aid\" didn't taste like Cool-Aid. Grew up on the stuff so I ought to know. 

The food came to the table cold, and I did have to ask to have the fried chicken (usually served warm) re-heated. That took another 15 minutes - wonder where it went for that time frame, by which time my waffle was cold and greasy - what happened to the waffle, FFS?

I had to eat in a hurry, since we did only get two hours for the break and it was taken up with waiting. There is no food worth waiting two hours on - seriously, there's no place where you have to wait for two hours to eat. I'm not going back there unless they can prove they are able to take care of paying customers, and even then I will put it on camera, so I have proof."}
{"text":"The best fried chicken I've EVER HAD! Granted I usually get KFC and other fast food. Lol. All in all the waffles were like my grandmas old fashioned ones. Big portions. I took home half of my meal home. LaBria was my awesome personable server. I took her recommendations and was not sorry. I will definitely be back. The Georgia peach drink topped it off."}
{"text":"This place is the real frickin deal. I'm going to say this place is better than Roscoe's. I said it. Yes I did. The chicken was the best fried chicken I've ever had and that's coming from someone who loooooves soul food. I aint' talking about no KFC here.. The waffle was definitely tasty with hints of cinnamon. The greens were da booombb..... kool-aid hit the spot on a hot day and the chicken and waffles were amazing on their own.
If i lived in AZ, I would be hitting up this place on a bi-weekly basis.
Wish the place is a bit bigger since the wait to eat is a little long but I heard they're moving to a new location."}
{"text":"Took the whole family to Lo lo's this morning and it didn't disappoint. I have had better chicken and waffles (maybe one other place) but the server was great and the entire experience was terrific. The tummy is happy!"}
{"text":"Honestly, it was just underwhelming. The shrimp and grits is under portioned and the grits are spicy with no flavor. The chicken is good, as ome would hope at a chicken place. The service was spotty and just bare bones. 

I don't know. I just don't like leaving a place saying \"wow, I regret eating that meal\" let alone spending $50 there."}
{"text":"I should put a disclaimer from the start that this was my first chicken and waffle experience, but that aside, this was the best fried chicken I have ever had regardless of delicious waffle and syrup additions!  I am in love, I don't know why I ever ate waffles without chicken!  Seriously, if you doubt at all, go try them!  We also ordered the wings, the hot sauce here is amazing with a strong vinegar flavor. The red beans and rice side is also fab. The service was incredibly nice, my iced tea and water mason jars were constantly refilled."}
{"text":"Wow, my wife and I ate there and it was a complete disaster.  First, the person at the door who greeted us didn't seem like she wanted to be there.  After sat, we waited about 7 minutes before I had to get up and ask if we were going to be waited on.  People looked at me and it was apparent that I had a look of I needed something, but to no avail.  When I asked to see the manager, that took several minutes.  He offered us free dessert, but I didn't bother ordering any.  The service was once we ordered was poor as well.

My buddy and I would go to the one in Scottsdale and it was always a great experience, so I was I excited to bring my wife to the LoLos's experience.  When I asked her what she thought afterwards, she said KFC tasted better."}
{"text":"I have always been a skeptic about chicken and waffles. My fiancé took me here on Friday night to try it out. OMG!! the waffle is amazing has cinnamon or something in it, I could have just eaten that, but the chick was love at first bite.
My fiancé is not a real chicken lover, but he can't stop raving to everyone about how juicy, tasty, crunchy and hot the chicken was. That should be all you need to convince you this place had got the goods.
We will be back to try other items on the menu, as they menu is large and everything sounds so delish."}
{"text":"Had their Betty Boob (chicken breast and waffle with butter and syrup) along with sides of whipped potatoes, collared greens, and mac n' cheese. Service was friendly. Their award winning hot sauce was delicious. Chicken was a little dry, but overall everything tasted quite good."}
{"text":"I've been going to and enjoying Lo-Lo's since it was in the old house on Central. I went in tonight and was promptly seated and then sat there for 10 minutes waiting for someone to come take my order, or even say hello. After 10 minutes I got up, used the bathroom, and then left. I won't be back after that crappy  excuse for service. Oh, and you're out of paper towels in the men's restroom as well."}
{"text":"Great food. Great music. Excellent service.
Waffles were not too sweet. Chicken was fried perfectly and loved the cornbread & catfish."}
{"text":"Easily some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. I ordered the #3, which gives you three pieces of assorted chicken that you can custom order. It also comes with a short stack of waffles. I was hesitant at first, but could all of these other reviews be wrong? Nope! Chicken and waffles together is a fantastic mix. The salt and grease from the chicken complements the sweet, but not too sweet, syrup and moist waffles. 

Of course, how can I forget the \"blue\" Kool-Aid in the mason jar. I was hyper for the next 2 hours from all of the sugar. The hostess was really nice and the atmosphere was friendly and casual. The layout is like a diner, with your regular tables and bar seating. ESPN and the news was turned on lightly in the background while they played old school R&B jams that brought me back. I got a kick out of the menu and the titles for some of the dishes like Phat Boy and DVZ's Hot Ghetto Mess!

Tips for leftovers: Bake your leftover chicken at 350 degrees for about 7 minutes, depending on the size. It comes out a lot better than microwaving, IMO. But, go ahead and microwave those waffles - they still taste ok a day or two later."}
{"text":"It was a rocky start with my first impressions about this place. This was our first time at lo-lo's.  So, my boyfriend and I were waiting on getting our orders, but no one was helping us at all. But, a server Aleathea saw us and took care of us so well! She was DEFINITELY nice. She picked us up as her table when no one wanted us. The manager also gave a discount on the food for not being helped the first time. The Al Madin was delicious and Lo-Lo chicken and waffles was good as well. I was going to rate this 2.5 for service, but they earned their stars back. Food was good. We Will come back to be served by her again."}
{"text":"Awsome food!!! The chicken and waffles are on point, very clean and friendly. I strongly recommend this place if your looking for that southern food like back home this is the place. Trust me you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my sweetheart who is a serious fried chicken lover...he said the food was \"pretty good, but not the best he's had\".  Southern comfort food is not my first choice, but I enjoyed the 20% I could eat of the MONSTER portioned meal I ordered!  My biggest praise comes from the experience eating here.  The place has an infectious, fantastic energy in large part because every single employee is friendly, upbeat, and seems to genuinely love working there.  It is a rare gem when you find a restaurant, especially a casual one, where the staff is HAPPY and that energy infused every interaction and the entire evening with pure delight."}
{"text":"Pretty darn amazing! Portions and prices are reasonable and generous. Food comes out piping hot and delicious.  Staff is accommodating and friendly. My only ding to this place is that sometimes it's not always the cleanest place. It can be reminiscent of a mall eatery where some things just aren't picked up or wiped off. I would hope and imagine that the kitchen would be kept much nicer. Of course, try the chicken and waffles as well as their chicken fried chicken. These guys know their soul food."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place.  This is the only place in Phoenix that I have been able to find that serves authentic cheesy grits and fried chicken gizzards.  If you are from the south you know that these are mainstays to your diet.  I drive out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"This place has awesome food. I've only been once but, I definitely will be coming back to explore more of the menu. Since I'm not from AZ I was looking for a soul food place that reminds me of home (Atlanta,GA) and this place did a fine job at that."}
{"text":"Great service - lots of staff, everyone checks on you including mgnt.  Probably the best fried chicken I've ever had.  Waffles were pretty good, Kool-Aid was a little sweet, but terrific and nostalgic.  Excellent decor as well.  I'll be back and I'm bringing friends."}
{"text":"Get the Stupid Fries and a big jar of tea. You're done! This place is really good, great service. Getting a little pricey for a lunch place but its good. Big servings"}
{"text":"The waffles... yes. The chicken... YES! 

I had the Tre-Tre and my friend had the Lil' C.  Drinks are served in mason jars so you don't need refills very often, and everything comes with huge mounds of butter and in generous portions. Lolo's does not skimp. The waffles are golden brown and have a cinnamony, home-cooked element. If my waffles were just a tad on the crispier side they would have been perfect. 

The fried chicken is pretty amazing. I don't claim to really know much (or anything) about good friend chicken, but I know this is among the best I can remember having. Perfectly seasoned, juicy, and again, non-skimpy. I finished all mine and even stole some from my friend's plate. Whoopsie. 

Service was fine, the kid who was our server could pick up the pace next time for a better tip. Also, my check was returned to me cardless. I guess he accidentally dropped my card behind the counter and couldn't find it for a few minutes. Alright.

I'm going back soon."}
{"text":"I love this place! You've got to go if you haven't been.  Go for the whole experience: Chicken, Waffle, Kool-aide, Grits!"}
{"text":"Bomb a$$ waffles. White meat is a tad dry. Superb service. I haven't gotten good service like this in ages. Manager visited every table and was so sweet- thats what a MOD is suppose to do! Fiance has been in Thailand for a month, I asked what he wants to eat when he gets back...and he said lolo's!!!"}
{"text":"I ride my bike to work.  Today I was running a little bit later than I usually do.  I had the slightest of hangovers, so getting out the door was a bit more delayed than is typical.

I was riding my bike down Scottsdale Rd.  I've peaked in the window of Lo-Lo's before and I saw that it was under construction.  Today, I saw people standing around inside.  It was open.

I decided, Fuck it.  I'm never late to work, so today I can be a few minutes behind schedule.  I still made it to work on time, but I set down a Styrofoam box next to my computer with chicken and waffles.

The waffles have a taste of cinnamon to them and they're super buttery and delicious.  The chicken is not the best chicken I've ever had, but the best chicken I've ever had was so good that if I told you how good it was, you would simply assume that I was exaggerating.

The chicken is damn good though.  The recipe that they use is very much complimented by using a splash of Louisiana hot sauce.  It was phenomenally bomb.

I stared out the window, watching the clouds loom in the distance and raindrops spit down the glass... all the while chewing on a chicken bone and feeling my hangover dissolve into genuine comfort."}
{"text":"Just stopped in - even on Friday Night Super Bowl Weekend they got us seat quick and service by Max was fast and pleasant.  Food was Even Better. I had Catfish & waffles. Added LoLos homemade gravy. A must. Super flavor added to Great Waffles. We also had LoLos Southern Fried Chicken. I should have taken picture when We started because nothing left when done.  We Will Be Back!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The wait was long!  We still decided to wait it out.  I was told the was was 35 min to get seated.  First available seating was outside, we took it.  Four other families were seated after us.  However we were the last to get our order taken.  Everyone else received their food around us , were still waiting .. I made a complaint to our server.  She got manager to come out to tell us that chicken tenders are taking sooo long to cook.  That's the reason why our food was not coming out.  We came into restaurant at 3:30 , was seated at 3:50,  ordered our food by 4:05 ... Time is now 4:43 food arrived.  All I can say is food was worth the wait.  Food was excellent!  Although I don't recommend getting seated outside, there are homeless people who come around to ask for food , money , and were rude.  Besides the wait and sitting outdoors , food was excellent!"}
{"text":"I feel no guilt at all eating chicken, waffles, and mac & cheese from Lo-Lo's because their food is worth what has to be a ridiculously high caloric intake. The waffles are hands down the best I have had in the Valley. My mother will also be excited to know I will even eat the okra at Lo-Lo's (it's fried). Their sweet tea is also amazing, and everytime I go I wish I had a brought a jug with me so I could have them fill it up and take it home.

Improvements they have made over the last few years include an additional add-on to the restaurant (a converted house) for more seating, as well as some signage off of Central so you don't miss the turn onto Yuma Street. 

For first timers concerned about the neighborhood and/or what some believe to be the strange combination of chicken & waffles -- JUST GO. I have been to Lo-Lo's at lunchtime as well as late at night and never had an issue. To the chicken & waffle non-believers - try it once and you will get it."}
{"text":"Went there last Friday around 8pm.  The place was packed.  I just wanted some carry-out so it wasn't a big deal.  

The food was some of the best, I've had in the 6 months I've lived in Arizona.  The price was a bit more than I expected, but the portion was large enough for dinner, and lunch the next day.  

It's a good place for southern comfort food."}
{"text":"Miss the old building but food is good as always! And the sweet tea is always thirst quenching"}
{"text":"WOW! I came here little bit off guard. From outside it looks like just a modest family restaurant but oh my.. when you're inside, you immediately feel comfortable with all the soulful songs, home made fried chicken and waffle.. And they served the tea in a jar!! Just love it! The food taste so great, I come back for more.."}
{"text":"In order to arrange a upcoming UYE \"Butter Party \" , Jim , Audrey, Donald , Amy B , Heather  and myself set up a little waffle exploration meeting.  For the good of the order we met up to partake in the phenomenon known as \"waffles and chicken \". To be fully prepared for the UYE we ate to our hearts content . I have to be honest and not lie, that I fully loved every scrumptious morsel. From the yummy waffle, tasty chicken , to the  yummy cornbread  it was all good.. but the highlight of my eating was the macaroni and cheese ...creamy , sublime , rich , crusty in places, sharp cheese laced, man ,I really like that stuff. I didn't know if I should share the delicious treat with my family or squirrel it away in my purse to savor later.   Kids loved it , waffles and fried food goes over big in our family. 

The service was exceptionally good, courteous , well thought out , and  made the place. Decor is a bit of whimsy with homey flair . Bright and airy , fresh and  comfortable.  Love the big old mason jars for drinks , nice down home touch, folks .  We met the manager who was very nice and willing to make all of our UYE dreams come true. She also informed us that they will be opening soon for the late night crowd from 5pm-3am. 
Simply can't wait to go back.... Anybody busy tomorrow?"}
{"text":"Some places need no introduction. Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles is one of them.

Most people I know are familiar with this valley original. Just in case you know the name, but have yet to sample the southern/soul-food offerings, try this simple test. Drive to the nearest Lo-Lo's and stand in the parking lot. It's gotta be the most intoxicating aroma around any restaurant! I had no idea how good sweet maple and savory fried chicken smelled together until my first visit to the original Lo-Lo's on Central.

I'm lucky that my lunch time co-horts have an adventurous attitude toward eating. Either that or we're all closet foodies. Regardless, we ended up just south of downtown today and I was in the mood for breakfast. I've tried the chicken and waffles on previous visits. Today was an opportunity to enjoy the biscuits and gravy.

We arrived before noon because this place can fill up fast. We were seated right away and our server Alexis was awesome. The food arrived quickly and everything was piping hot. The fried potatoes were obviously cooked to order and the biscuits were fluffy and covered with a delicious sausage gravy. Probably the best version of this dish I've ever enjoyed. And my co-workers each enjoyed the Betty Boob (chicken breast and a waffle).

Good food, great service, friendly staff, nice decor... What more could you possibly want?"}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles continues to impress me! I ate in the Scottsdale location a few years ago, before they moved up Scottsdale Road to their new digs at Drinkwater Blvd. You gotta love the character and atmosphere inside each Lo-Lo's! And that aroma!

I still prefer to visit the downtown location on Central, but I've reviewed that one separately. And this location is slightly closer to my office. Both locations still manage to fill up at lunch time, very quickly.

The lunch crew tried to arrive early, but that was thwarted at the office. Still, we were seated quickly. And we ordered our drinks and food together. It took a while for the food to arrive, but that's not unusual at a Lo-Lo's when they are busy. And it was a Friday. We were relaxed and enjoying the last opportunity to sit on the patio during the lunch hour.

The food was outstanding! Again, no surprise here. Most of my co-workers tried my favorite Biscuits and Gravy. I wanted something different. Who knew Fried Catfish went so well with a fresh waffle? Lo-lo's knew! That's why \"D. Mann\" is on the menu. And the Sweet Tea is an excellent drink on a warm, late spring day.

Our server Patricia did a nice job of keeping things moving quickly, splitting the check and being there when needed. Thank you Patricia and thank you Lo-Lo's!"}
{"text":"You have to try the kool salad is huge and really good but you can't go to LOLO and not try at least one piece of chicken is well done and good size pieces. ohh n of course you got get koolaid."}
{"text":"Recently just moved from Atlanta and was feeling a tad homesick so my husband brought me here! I can't even begin to describe how amazing it was!  The hostess was promt and friendly.  Our server, Bruce, was the best waiter I have ever had!  Efficient, friendly, knowledgeable, not pushy but always there when needed!  His personality, like the food, was incredible!  The food was a southern piece of heaven!  Fried green tomatoes, sweet tea, grits, and chicken and waffles.  Absolutely, hands down, this is my new favorite restaurant!!!!! But I WILL call first to see if Bruce is working !!!   YALL GOTTA' EAT HERE!!!
SOUTHERN PERFECTION !!!!"}
{"text":"The best fried chicken I've ever eaten, a serious collection of southern soul food, the staff is great, even the customers are fun. You gotta go to Lo-Lo's."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service needs work. Today was the final straw. Went in after church and waited a hour and a half (not including waiting to be seated) only to watch groups that were seated after me dine and leave. When I had finally had enough and decided to leave after watching the couple next me (who arrived way after me) receive their order (similar to mine) the waiter wanted me to pay for the mimosa that I had drank because legally they could not \"serve free alcohol\". The only explanation I was offered was that the kitchen was backed up and they apologized. Needless to say I left without paying a dime and unfortunately still hungry. This wasn't the first time a situation similar to this has happened at this location. It'll definitely be awhile before I decide to spend my money there again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is well known for Southern Style Foods.

Short Story- 
Good Service and Good Crispy Seasoned Fried Chicken and Good Waffles but some of the other items not so good. The portions are crazy big and might satisfy GODZILLA.

Long Story-
This pack was PACKED with people early at lunch time. The hostess informed us that it would be a half hour wait and her prediction was very accurate as it was. We ordered and our server brings out our beverages in large canning jars. We wait and wait and then our server informs us that the kitchen is backed up and it will be a while for our food to arrive. So we wait and wait and were are real hungry by now. Our food does eventually arrive sometime after a half hour.

I received a soul food platter. You have many choices on how to build your platter and I picked a chicken thigh, a fish, and two sides. This platter also comes with a corn bread.

Chicken- Good! Crispy Skin, Seasoned Nice, Moist!

Fish- Awful- Served broken in half, over cooked with a terrible ultra thick corn meal coating that might have been a 1/3 of an inch thick. 

Macaroni and cheese- so-so-better than average for processed tasting cheese. Strong process cheese taste but doctored up well. Pasta was slightly over cooked. I note that I don't care for processed tasting Macaroni and Cheese. I know that most people only eat and make it that way so you might feel different than me depending on your taste.

Spicy Green Beans with Red Potatoes- Not Good- The green beans seemed almost canned. The beans might have been frozen but were very grey and over cooked. The potatoes seemed either steamed or boiled. They were not appetizing at all.

Corn Bread with GIANT ball of soft Butter- Good- sort of cake like, a little sweet and studded with corn. Tasted like a mix of cake with cornbread with LOTS of butter soaking in. It was like having a rich dessert. Also giant sized. You will hurt your self if you eat the whole thing.

My husband had the #3 Lo Lo's Plate. It cost $2.00 less than my plate and was a much better value. He had three pieces of chicken and waffles. I tasted a small piece of waffle and it was good.



Between the wait, The not so good fish, processed tasting macaroni and cheese and the not appetizing spicy green beans with red potatoes and the $42.35..brought things down for me.


If you stick with only the things that Lo Lo's does best you will do better than I did.  Go there when you are monstrously hungry.

3 Stars according to Yelp means A-OK and worth a try. 


I give three stars when it's a mixed review with some reservations."}
{"text":"First thing: service was great! Check 
Second thing: food and quality sucks! 
Third thing: no bottled waters, no salt and pepper shakers on table and when I asked for one they gave us exactly one, the salt with no pepper 
Fourth thing: if your diabetic, stay away from the lemonade, you may just have an insulin attack! This place is a terrible version of great soul food. What a waste of time and money"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Chicken and Waffles and it was a great experience. The chicken did not look that exciting but the taste made up for it. The waffles were big,  warm and fluffy. I got the Betty ' s Boob and that was very filing. The service was great and there is a DJ on Friday and Saturday nights (who was great)! Too bad we are only in town visiting!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I ordered the \"lo-lo\". And a side of cheesy grits. I couldn't put my fork down. The creamy, cheesy grits were cooked perfect. Heaven!  The chicken was crispy and hot and juicy. The waffle was crisp yet tender with a sprinkle of cinnamon. I'm not sure if I'm a fan of the cinnamon but it was delicious. This is the kind of place you crave again as you walk out of the door!  Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"A little overrated for me =\ 
Extremely long wait for average food. Chicken was a little dry, no matter what part of the chicken I ate. And waffle was just ok. But to my surprise I LOVED the corn bread. I wish I just ordered 8 loaves to-go!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and I have to say I'm ashamed of myself for having not been here sooner.

The place is pretty big and has a great atmosphere! Our server was Steven and he had the most perfect voice! We got our drinks and I had to try the sweet tea. If you're a fan of southern sweet tea, then you will NOT be disappointed. I felt like I was in Georgia when I took that first sip. And they serve drinks in a giant Mason jar!

We started off with their Stupid Fries and that was super delicious. I had their soul food platter where you can make your own plate. I had the 3 piece chicken with Mac and cheese and potato salad with a corn bread. It came to us hot and quick. The chicken was so flavorful and easy to get off the bone. Wasn't too impressed with the potato salad but omigosh the cornbread! 

Service was pretty good. The waiter took a while to come back to refill drinks. But other than that, I highly recommend coming here. Great for a casual date night, family night, or having a meal with some good friends. Can't go wrong with some good fried chicken and a big Mason jar of sweet tea!"}
{"text":"I had heard people rave about Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles but had never made it a point to go until last night. I met 2 of my longtime friends there and it was a busy place!  They already had a seat for me, so I didn't have to wait. The Waitress was right on top of taking care of us with a great personality and huge genuine smile!  We visited a little bit and then Boom- our food was there! 

I had the Lo-Lo's and it was delicious!  It came with 3 pieces of crispy fried chicken and 2 large waffles with butter and maple syrup. I didn't need anything else! The taste was fabulous with just a hint of cinnamon in the waffles and the just right fried chicken!  Washed it all down with lemon water in a large Mason Jar glass! There was no room for dessert for any of us. 

Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place to eat! Everything is amazing! If you're in Phoenix, you NEED to eat here! I love that they have different selections of Kool-Aid too!"}

Usually I would get upset about this but everyone was so nice !! When the food came out it was so great ! It was worth the wait . I ordered chicken and waffles and my friend ordered French toast !"}
{"text":"Great food,  great service by Depeah!  Nailed the 14oz steak special, delish!! Huge menu lots to pick from all is awsome."}
{"text":"SOOOO GOOD!

If you're in Phoenix and you want fried chicken, go here.  The chicken is perfectly fried, tasty, and juicy.  It's exactly how I like my fried chicken.  And the waffles are delicious.  

I was sad when I had to stop eating my waffles to eat more chicken and then I was sad to stop eating my chicken to take a bite of my waffles.  That's how good the food is!  Yes yes, I could have eaten both simultaneously, but I wanted to taste the flavor of each because they can stand alone and knock your socks off.

If I were a guest on the show \"Best thing I ever ate - fried chicken\" this would be the place I recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and myself were visiting Phoenix for a wedding, and before we came I looked up this place. I am so glad that I did! The food was really good, the service was great and fast. The only thing is that my husbands Banana caramel pancakes were really really sweet. I wish I would have known that they were serving mac and cheese and greens because those looked amazing and I would have loved  tried them. When I come back I will make sure that this is one of the first place's that I visit."}
{"text":"Shrimp Mac and cheese is sooooooo good! The chicken and waffles are prefect, too! Ordered these while in town with some mimosas. Our waitress was friendly and helping. Definitely a place to stop and get some warm soul food"}
{"text":"Wow!!! This is the BEST chicken I've had ever! The waffles are amazing. After telling some people abt the restaurant, everyone had a comment to say, but the combo is really good. You aren't mixing the waffles w/syrup and chicken; I mean realistically you can, but they taste so good individually that you you'll savor every bite! 

I'm going to bring the hubby here! So yummy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! The staff are always incredibly sweet and personable. We barely make our way over here once every six months and they remember us every time! The food is always fresh and delicious. Even when they're crazy busy, you'll never have to wait to long and you'll leave full and happy."}
{"text":"Their catfish is light and crispy, very pleased. The fried chicken was also amazing. To top off the meal, their sweet cornbread is great as well."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Amazing food. The host was very friendly and welcoming. The waitress Cierra did not have an urgency to see us. When taking our order, she rudely asked \"Are you ready to order or not?\" Would've given a 5 star if it wasn't for Cierra."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my husband for a quick bite right before lunch.   We had heard about this place being good, so we were exited that we just happened to be near it that day.  I had other lunch plans so opted to just share with my husband.  He ordered the chicken and waffles wih grits and eggs.  He knows how much I love grits so he gave those to me.  I hate to sound full of myself, BUT I make delicious grits!  So I can't say I was too crazy about these.  They really didn't have any flavor to them.  They did have lots of butter though.  Now, the chicken on the other hand was perfect.  Perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, just perfect!The waffles were really good too!  My husband really enjoyed his egss.  I didn't try those, though.  I will go back to try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"Suki suki now!

This is some damn good food.  Best fried chicken in my life.  Tha Mac and cheese was ok...not special but good.  The service was awesome!  The servers were literally hugging us as we left.  

About $15 a person...not cheap but worth it."}
{"text":"If you find yourself lost in the greater Arizona area and longing for some Southern style fried chicken, scoot on over to Lo-Lo's and completely ruin yourself for any other fried chicken ever again.  This is seriously the best fried chicken place we've been to since leaving Florida, and we've been to 19 states and the District of Columbia eating our way across America. We've been to two of their locations, but here we had Deandre as our server at this one, and he was great.

Believe me when I tell you, you haven't had sweet tea until you've had it southern style (i.e. - so much sugar you almost pucker), and they do it well here.  They even serve Kool-Aid in mason jars (as with all of their drinks).  The chicken is breaded with a tantalizing blend of spices and deep fried (can I get a \"hell yeah!\"), and you can't go wrong with any of their sides. My mouth is watering just thinking about it, and I miss this restaurant more than any others since moving away from Phoenix!

I'm going to dedicate a separate paragraph (gasp!) for the banana pudding.  Scandalous, I know.  Remember all that traveling I told you about in the first paragraph?  I've never found ANYWHERE with banana pudding this good.  It's big enough to share, but we each get our own. You should too. It's that good. I haven't even found a place IN THE SOUTH with banana pudding this good, including my grandma's house (although if you tell her that I will deny it to my last breath).

I'm not going to tell you that you should make a a special Trip to Phoenix for Lo-Lo's, but you should totally make a a special Trip to Phoenix for Lo-Lo's.  Road trip?  Lo-Lo's.  Layover in Phoenix?  Extend it and go to Lo-Lo's.  Live on Earth?  Go to Lo-Lo's."}
{"text":"4.5 stars! 

To borrow a phrase from George Takei, oh my! We finally tried this place out after hearing about it from several of our friends and coworkers who have lived in the area for quite some time. We read a few reviews, liked what we saw, and made it a point to go. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and shown to our table. The decor is sort of a modern meets rustic look.  

Our waitress Leslie came right over and took our drink order.  The menu is huge, and we wanted to try everything on it. Needless to say it took us a few minutes to make our decisions, but then we were ready to bring on the hurt. We knew then that this was simultaneously going to be both the best and worst decision ever for dinner. My wife ordered the Lo Lo's chicken and waffles, I ordered the 8 double D's chicken breast and waffle, and we got an order of fries and corn bread to share. We also ordered two drinks off of their specialty menu, a Keep it Simple for my wife, and the tropical drink for me. Sadly, I can't remember the name of the drink. 

The fries and the corn bread came out first.  The corn bread was good, but not the best I've had. The fries are hand cut with a glorious seasoning.  Anyone who knows me well knows my unhealthy obsession with french fries...It's rivaled only by my love of tacos. The fries never stood a chance. Every now and then I would pause for half a second to dip one in ketchup, but they were so good they really didn't need it. Shortly thereafter the rest of the food came out.

The main course came out on large dishes that were roughly the size of trampolines. My inner fat kid was practically leaping up and down at this point. The amount of food piled on the plates bordered on unnatural. It was about this time that my wife and I realized we may have ordered too much food. We didn't care. We were too busy staring down our plates like two gunslingers before a high noon showdown and furiously snapping photos for our future Yelp post. Our stomachs grumbled with anticipation.

The chicken was delicious, juicy, and breaded and fried southern style. The waffles were soft and made to order with their special batter. I went all out, ripping my chicken breast off the bone and stuffed it in the waffle, loaded it with butter, syrup, and hot sauce. With a big grin on my face, I folded it up like a giant delicious taco and ate it like it was my last meal on earth. My inner fat kid was getting worried at this point, because he knew there was more to come. Syrup and butter streaming down my hands, I enjoyed it to the last crumb. The waffle split and threatened to spill its contents all over the table several times, but I'm no amateur taco eater. The hot sauce is medium, with a little bit of a kick but not too much, and a nice spicy offset to the sweetness of the syrup.  

Throughout the course of our meal, our table was visited several times by our waitress and other staff members. They kept the drinks filled and cleared away finished plates. Everyone was friendly and made for a great service experience.

To finish it off, we ordered the banana pudding for dessert. No true Southerner can pass up banana pudding when given the choice. I grew up on my grandma's banana pudding, so there was a high bar of expectations set. I was not disappointed. The style was different from that of my grandmothers, but it was still very good. They use crumbled vanilla wafers as both a base and a topping. As with the drinks, it comes out served in a large mason jar. Be warned, it's a big serving, so come hungry or be ready to share.  My wife threw in the towel about a quarter of the way through. Rookie.  I tore through it like a Serengeti Lion devouring its prey.

My hunger sated and my inner fat kid crying for mercy, I lay down my fork and napkin in victory. I'm fairly certain I ate the equivalent of two days caloric intake. with a smile on my face, I thought dreamily of the Tums sitting on my nightstand at home."}

To top it off the employee cooking forgot to start making the food. How does one forget to make food if it's your sole responsibility?.... 


It was the last chance for my boyfriend to experience the famous lolo's chicken and waffles and the employees completely dropped the ball. I understand things happen, but why not try to correct the problem and try to rush an order, to try and turn the customer experience around?

After working in the food and beverage industry for 11 years, I would expect better. Luckily they refunded his money, but they could have cared less.

Stick to other places in the airport for food."}
{"text":"How they do it, I don't know, but their waffles, which must be the best on the planet, don't even really need syrup.  Not that syrup hurts.  I think it's all the butter that ends up on everything.  The fried chicken really can't be beat either, but I just can't stop thinking about those waffles.

If I lived next door, I'd have to exercise about four hours a day to burn those 50,000 calories.

This from their website: \"Since Lo-Lo's has been open they've offered catering service for the likes of the Arizona Cardinals, Angie Stone, Mary J. Blige, Anthony Hamilton, the Whispers, Snoop Dogg, Allen Iverson, Steve Francis, and members of the Chicago Cubs. ... Shawn Marion, whose birthday cake was made at Lo-Lo's, calls Sandy Sand's Red Velvet Cake one of his favorites.\"

I don't know how I didn't make the list, but count me in."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken and tasty thin waffles. I prefer the Scottsdale location, but the airport venue has the same yummy delights."}
{"text":"This place was FABULOUS! GREAT, friendly wait staff. And there were plenty staff on hand so even tho the place was packed they were right on it . The food was outstanding and plenty of it.. I had the southern fried chicken and rice and beans side . The corn bread was yummy and had pieces of corn in it . I shared with my daughter so also had half a biscuit which was equally  delicious. For dessert we split the banana pudding which was SOOOOO GOOD! ( Lots of bananas in it and pieces of  I believe we nilla wafers) .... I would absolutely  recommend Lolo's to anyone! Can't wait to go back :-)"}
{"text":"My niece and I went here on a Thursday around 6pm and we were seated immediately. This was my first visit to Lo-Lo's, since I am new to the Phoenix area. I absolutely loved the waffle as it was hot, fresh, and delicious! I tried it without syrup, just to see how it tasted before the condiments and it was still awesome... a hint of cinnamon is in the batter. I was thoroughly impressed especially since I'm not a waffle person. The chicken initially was flavorful, but clearly had been underneath a warmer to stay hot. Since I'm a stickler for fresh, I sent it back and asked for fresh chicken. The waiter exchanged it with no issue. The lemonade was fresh-squeezed and so good. Aside from the small hiccup on the chicken, my first experience was excellent. Oh and the music was awesome! I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Never had chicken and waffles before, but I was definitely intrigued.  I saw a Throwdown episode on chicken and waffles.  I thought to myself I need to try that.  Lo-Lo's is a great place to try this interesting combination of food.  

I had the two piece dark meat with waffles and Kool-aid.  I couldn't finish it so I brought it home.  It was even yummy as a leftover.  Yummy in my tummy is how I'm going to leave it.  :P"}
{"text":"I love LoLo's . Awesome food, awesome wait staff . Loved it but dam that music was so over the top loud we couldnt hold a conversation across the table from each other. With the exception of the loud music  I highly recommend the food, and service and cleanliness."}
{"text":"When it comes to flavor, you can't beat Lo-Lo's in comparison to the others.  Some of the staff are cordial and interact, some...not so much, but everyone working there is having a good time.  

I got the Number 1, washed it down with blue Kool-Aid and it was awesome.  My chick got the Betty Boop, and we were both very happy.  I don't typically choose to eat food that has been fried, but i'll make the exception for Lo-Lo's."}
{"text":"Was there for lunch this afternoon it was amazing  super friendly super fast  excellent food  couldn't have had a  better time A+++"}
{"text":"This was a very hard one for me to review! I have been looking for a great chicken house that offers that unbelievable chicken! I have heard of this place, and have been meaning to try it out. So my daughter wanted to take me somewhere for my birthday! Since we had nothing else to do, I brought up Lo-Lo's. Since this place closes at 4:pm on Sunday? We arrived around 2:30, according to the hostess there were going to be about a hour wait! Well we didn't get all dressed up for nothing! Told her a party of three, and during the wait we went over to Jamba Juice for a cool smoothie. Now we were outside waiting when they called our name, that hour turned into only a half hour wait! But since we did not finished our smoothie, we were told to finish it or throw it away! Not allowed to bring it in? When we were seated, I had to squeeze between our table and a table next to us, when I did that I ended up getting syrup on my pants. Don't want anything sticky on your pants!!!! Yes they try to get as much seating in there as possible. Now Michael who was our server was very apologetic! Got me a warm wash rag, to clean up. I ordered their betty boop, this comes with a waffle and a breast of chicken! Daughter had their big ass chicken sandwich with fries. We also shared a chili cheese fries. Their waffle was very good, it compares with our favorite in Oakland at Full House! Daughter enjoyed the sandwich, and yes! It's a big ass sandwich! So come prepared! Their chili fries were good, it was advertised to be spicy, it had a little twang in it. But I have had better. Now to their chicken, I love fried chicken! My favorite is at M & M soul food in Gardena Ca. So I was real excited about coming here and trying their chicken. Maybe I expected to much? Maybe I have already tasted the best chicken possible? But Lo-Lo's chicken did not meet my expectations! Now I am not saying their chicken is bad, there is no way that is true. But I was really hoping this was it! So when it comes down to it, YES I would come back! But my search for a great fried chicken in the Phoenix area is still on going! The best thing about our experience is Michael our server! He had a great attitude, looks like he loves what he is doing! He is by far, one of the best servers we have ever had!! 
Oh yea! They have Kool-Aid!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was very good, I think what makes it Lo-Lo's is the cinnamon infused waffles. It's definitely somewhere I would take visitors. Will definitely order more food next time."}
{"text":"i had the shrimp in grits which i wasnt too fond of. the shrimp was fried and there was heavy cheddar cheese on the grits. also i found it slightly disturbing all the photographs of live chickens on walls with children on farms hanging around the restaurant. talk about carnivorous guilt."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and the food is great!  went for breakfast to have the Chicken and Waffles which I never had in my life.  Will be back soon as it was great!"}
{"text":"A little bit difficult to find and an off beat menu pairing but it was good. (Note:  despite the Yelp map showing it on the E side of Central, Lo-Lo's is actually West of Central two doors on the North side of Yuma).  The sign is small so keep your eyes open.

Walk in and the waiting area has several nice pieces of art displayed as well as a book section where you can enjoy a quick read in kind of a coffee house atmosphere.  If you have time.  The guy and the girl who were working staff were quick, polite, helpful and cheery.  We were seated right away.  Service was prompt and lightening fast, but I went before the noon rush with only 4 other parties when we arrived and 3 more that came along after us.  So I imagine it changes, YMMV

I had the Lil' Amadi combo opting for two thighs and a waffle plus a large Sweet Tea.  Chicken was great, flavorful and juicy but not too salty and the waffles crispy and tasty - cooked just right.  The Massive Kern mason jar of sweet tea was never empty thanks to prompt staff workers.  
Total of mine came in at $10.38, then I tipped 20%.  Fair fare price - LOL!

YELPERS: This Place is another one of the gems I might never have found without browsing the selections on Yelp.  

Thanx Yelp for keeping it fresh."}
{"text":"I only get the Betty Boop & and orange soda and it's so much food that I don't need anything else.  The chicken is really good.  The waffles are even better.  Both taste great with syrup on 'em.

I tried the mac & cheese once...it was just ok.  I tried the green beans...they were good.

I like the atmosphere, location, service and supporting locally-owned business, so I'll be back any time I can!"}
{"text":"Always good in the Hood! We stop by LoLo's every time we get to Phoenix! Fried chicken and grits are my fave!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably delicious! One of their locations is just a short several blocks from the Scottsdale Stadium, so glad we stopped by after we attended a Giants Game for Spring Training.... and we just so happened to be lucky enough to have been greeted by the owner. He, along with his staff were amazing. We asked our waiter for advice on several dishes... and she was awesome.
The owner even brought us something that was not on the menu! A biscuit with butter covered in Syrup.... oh Lawd have mercy! I'd fly down to Arizona to eat this every weekend!
We have been to several Chicken & Waffles places; especially Roscoe's in the L.A. Area... Let me tell you, we came to an agreement (hubby, brother and I) that the chicken served here at Lolo's is BETTER... that's saying A LOT!

Try it for yourself; its amazing!"}
{"text":"I couldn't understand a word the hostess spoke to me while escorting me to my table, her back was to me the entire time. The hostess dropped off my setup and kept walking. My server was another story, she was very professional and very helpful. I ordered an appetizer of the fried gizzards, they were hot and not over cooked, greatly appreciate how they were cooked. However, I wish they used the same coating for the chicken and gizzards. The gizzards seriously lacked seasoning. My chicken was outstanding and was terrific! Very moist and hot, not over cooked or dried out. They know how to fry chicken here. My waffle was very good, I like that they serve a thin or Scandinavian style waffle. I would try this place again."}
{"text":"Hungover? Check. 
Hungy? Check. 
Downtown? Check

Means one thing I need something filling and greasy and the best plan was Lo-Lo's for me and my friends. Waking up on a Sunday morning and needing food we quickly decided that chicken and waffles was the only correct choice.

I ordered a arnold palmer with sweet tea and my friends got grape and red koolaid. All the drinks were great and served in some pretty large mason jars. The Arnold palmer with it's mix of sweet flavors and bitter bite of lemon was a great way to wake up and get some fluids of the non-alcoholic kind.

For food I got the Baby Ray's which is chicken covered in gravy and onions and some waffles. It was great the chicken was super moist inside and the flavors of the chicken, gravy and waffles make a savory bite that was as pleasing to the stomach as it was the tongue.  The gravy was just enough to cover the chicken but not so much it was too much. The waffles have a spice in them that i think is nutmeg but makes very flavorful on it's own without syrup. 

The meal was exactly what i needed to get me up and back to normal...sadly it was so good I ate so much I needed a glorious food coma to recover. I can't wait till I can come back and try the other goodies like Mac and Cheese or cornbread. Even the fried fish sounds good."}
{"text":"The best mashed potatoes I have ever eaten.  I asked what they put in them and they said it's a secret.  Just ate a container full that some one brought me when they came home from airport and stopped to get me some."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in Arizona, hands down. If you're a cool aid fanatic this is also a place for you . Usually crowded but never too long of a wait for food. All around 9/10 service ."}
{"text":"I've came to this place once a week for 2 months and I must say Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles always continues to surprises me . 

I just order two drumsticks and two waffles very well cooked I enjoyed it .. 


Well continue to return .."}
{"text":"The food was great, but service was AWFUL! Take it from a  liberal activist who believes in equal rights for all----I experienced reverse discrimination by the staff (3 hostesses) and management (Joaquin) is well aware...though did not do anything about it. Our server, Jamal, was wonderful! Arrived at 10:30am and were not sat until 12pm. Food served at 1:15pm. Left at 2:15pm. Almost 4 hrs.!!! Families (more than once) who arrived AFTER us were given a table based on race---which was made very apparent after witnessing a verbal \"thanks for hooking a brother up,\" asking the hostess for seating preferences, and fist pumping. Concerns were validated after  about 6 other caucasian families asked why another group was sat before them. This place needs more diversity and it goes to show racism can be felt by EVERY race. Nobody is exempt. Spend your money elsewhere (I suggest The Arrogant Butcher or CIBO) and don't support this particular franchise until a change is made. End racism. End hate. Love one another"}
{"text":"We have been in line for a while.  There are many. Waiting as well. When I asked why they were not seating in the empty tables, the girl just looked at me. They did seat 2 parties, but there are still empty tables and no one being seated. We enjoy eating here and we had an out of town guest that we eat here before the plane leaves. We have plenty of time, but they are not doing well today at all. What a disappointment.  Get some mature people to do the seating and keep up. The only reason I gave a 3 us because we know the food is excellent and we've never been treated this way before today."}
{"text":"I was not impressed. The food is bland and over-priced. Maybe my expectations were too high  because I'm from the south but this food was gross. The mac n cheese was like kraft with way too much cheese. The dirty rice had no flavor at all and the fish was salty. Not to mention the over-the-top menu names that seem very offensive. I do not recommend."}
{"text":"This place was bomb dizzle fo shizzle nizzle. Lol. They had some damn good mac and cheese. i ordered the lolos special, i think it was the #3 anyway, the chicken was real tasty and so were the waffles. Bring a camera when you come to this place because it has a real novelty aspect to it, this place might be a 5 star, but my waffle house experiences are close to none existent but i will edit my review if need be once i frequent more of these type places. Oh and they give you your drink in a big kerr canning jar 'pretty cool'"}
{"text":"Omg the best chicken ever !!!!
A little expensive but I guess you get what you pay for. It's southern fried chicken skin is amazingly flavored love the green beans and fried green tomatoes can't find those anyplace.guarantee you will love the chicken ."}
{"text":"Staff is rude and the chicken wasn't that great ...they messed our order up and when we brought it to their attention they acted like we did something wrong. I asked to order desert which is clearly on their menu board....yet was told in a sarcastic tone that we don't have deserts here  anymore ..then take them off the board ??!!!!  Not worth the money !!"}
{"text":"Hmm - what to say that hasn't been said already...

Can't think of anything. So let me keep it short and sweet. It took me longer to find this place than it did to get our food. After all the carrying on I've heard and read about, I was expecting Narnia on a plate.

It wasn't, but it was pretty tasty fare for the price. I had - in order of supreme goodness - the fried chicken, sweet tea, waffle, and mac & cheese. Fried chicken certainly worth the trip. Sweet tea was amazing;  sweet without being sacchariny and blended so perfectly. Waffle was very nice but I've had better (overseas, to be fair) and the mac & cheese was saucy but unspectacular. 

Come hungry, make sure you know where the hell you are going, and give it a go."}
{"text":"I ate here a year ago and I still dream about their waffles. Everything I tasted was delicious. 
The owner introduced himself to us. He was very nice and helpful. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Nothing special about the waffles or the chicken and the red velvet cake was underbaked?."}
{"text":"Pros:
   Really good waffles
   Chickens was alright
   Awesome Lemonade
   Good Service
Cons:
   Could get packed might be a wait"}
{"text":"Best southern cookin I've had since I moved here from the south. The breading on the chicken tasted delicious. We had sweet tea and it was made perfectly. For dessert we had the banana pudding and although it was hard to eat cuz we were so full it was too good to stop eating. The live band was the cherry on top"}
{"text":"Food is good, service was subpar.  Our main server didn't seem thrilled to help us. However, the other servers - bidders were gracious."}
{"text":"Hellz yeah! I love Lo-Lo's! I was only fortunate enough to visit this place once - after a 5 mile walk for JDRF. So - the calories that come along with fried chicken and waffles were acceptable. The food was awesome! I hope to be able to go back someday."}
{"text":"Chicken is really fresh and tasty. Green beans are good, Mac & cheese is good, waffles are a bit much a little to heavy. 
Cool Aid is sugar in a cup lol. Once you've finished your meal take 2 aspirins so that you don't have a heart attack!  But if you do have a heart attack it was worth it! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We order out from there once in awhile at work, and since the remodel, they act like the customer does not matter. First they got the order wrong, and then charged double for a couple of the items. When we called them to notify of the charges, they stated that this was the correct price and the ones on the internet menu are wrong. For a matter of $5 that they refused to refund and dismissed the issues with our order, they have lost at least 10 customers from our place of work as I will order from another place instead. Very very disappointed as I loved this place when I first ate there. At my old job, I ate there once a week. No mas!"}
{"text":"The idea of Lo-Lo's on a Sunday morning has to rank right up there with Segway, Farmville, and the bumpit. 
The line to get in was worse than the Indiana Jones ride at Disneyland on a school holiday.  
The hostess was sweet, explaining how the wait could be close to an hour or even longer. 
When asked if we could get take-out, her response was the same. 

Sadly, i couldn't wait an hour, eventually coming to grips with how my waiting in line with such a bad hangover could morph me into a one-man Donner party. 
As the hostess patiently awaited our response, I stared off into space, fantasizing about life in prison, the result of my conviction on some trumped-up cannibalism charges after the manager caught me gnawing-off an elderly woman's kankles. 

\"Sorry, we'll come back later,\" I politely responded. 

No chicken. 
No waffles. 
No prison.

Goodbye Lo-Lo, hello DeFalco's."}
{"text":"Food is alway great, and staff are wonderful! We love the vibe at this establishment!"}
{"text":"I love LoLo's.

We've been a number of times, both to the downtown Phoenix location and the Scottsdale Road location.  There's so many reviews here, that cover the basics well.  Here's my 2 cents worth:

On a weekend night or a Sunday afternoon, You may wait.  A long time.  So don't plan a movie or anything too close to the meal.

I enjoy the cross-section of customers, and the place has such a positive energy.  It just feels happy!

Our party of 12 had the MOST AWESOME server on my last visit, but every time I visit, I LOVE the service.  Friendly, accurate, and genuinely happy to be helping you.  

The salmon croquettes are very tasty.  I sampled one of my dining companion's and actually would consider ordering them on a future visit.  

I always get my waffles with pecans added, and they are so good it'll bring a tear to your eye.

The chicken is divine.  Their biscuits and gravy (Sunday special) is excellent.  Their chili is good.  You can't go wrong here, not matter what you order.

Take a slice of red velvet cake to go, because you likely will not be able to squeeze another mouthful in once you're done with your meal.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"It's sad when the best part of a meal isn't even what a restaurant is known for,  I'll keep it short and SWEET.

The chicken was mediocre.
The waffles were good.
The grits were ok, as best as I could tell, given it was my first time eating grits.
The ambiance wasn't great, but about what I expected, given the location.
The location was scary.
The service was functional.
The best part of the meal was the SWEET tea served in a mason jar...and I do mean SWEET!

I can't say I'd want to go back, but might if others wanted to.  I would offer some other restaurant choices, if asked."}
{"text":"This is my first time coming back to Lo-Lo's since it's been renovated. I really liked the grungy, homey, non-corporate feeling of the smaller location. The food seems to be about the same but the ambiance changed it all."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and decided to give this place a try. 

I tried the chicken fried steak and it was awesome. My sides were mac & cheese and waffle. Both were delicious. Amazing thing was they offered Kool Aid, several flavors. Have never had that at a restaurant, just as a kid at home. 

Overall this place was great and friendly."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here for a family of four. The bill was close to $100. Food was good but was not expecting to pay that much for only breakfast. This was my second visit in 6 months and food was not as great as my 1st visit. I didn't order the chicken and waffles as I wanted to venture off the menu and try another dish. Big disappointment! Stick to their chicken and waffles and you won't break the bank for a good meal."}
{"text":"Visiting the Phoenix area from back east and everyone kept talking about this place. Wasn't sure which location to go to but I assumed the more ghetto location would have the best food. However I decided to give the suburban Scottsdale location a go. Waitress saw us immediately and was very nice. I liked the look and feel of the place. I got the lo lo which is 3 pieces of chicken on two waffles. I had to get the Mac and cheese because the pictures of it look so good. The chicken was hot, juicy but a little dry and overcooked. But that was nothing that the hot sauce couldn't fix! But that chicken was definitely overcooked. I could eat that Mac n cheese all day!!!! It's soooo creamy and it's actually spiced! The seasoning throughout it is so good!!!! I recommend this place. The sweet tea is really really sweet btw so be warned!

I returned to this place and was disappointed with the broken air conditioning. It was really hot in there and the fact that the patio was open may have contributed to it. The host stand was confused about people's names and was so disorganized. Tables were left unbussed while patrons sat and sweated and waited.....and waited. The staff is a bit off and often confused. They really should get their air conditioning on point. This is July in Phoenix!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a fun restaurant. A good place to kick off a spring training vacation. It was quite busy and the food took an unusual amount of time to get out of the kitchen. On this particular visit, none of that mattered.

They have a server named Mike, who worked in the restaurant last Sunday, 3/19/17. 

I've been in the hospitality industry a long time and I have never come across a server so pleasant, so professional, and so on his game (even in the middle of chaos and adversity), as this individual. He's as good as it gets. 

If I came across this employee in my home town back in California, I would do the unethical thing, and try and steal him for my workplace. 

Congratulations to this restaurant for having this employee, which I'm sure is in some part attributed to their workplace culture, recruitment and hiring practices, but this specific employee is a gem. 

Cheers to that!"}
{"text":"I went to Lo-Lo's for the first time last night and all I have to say is that it will definitely not be the last time we'll be going.  Not only was the food delicious but also the service was pretty great. The only thing is that since we went on a pretty busy night specially since a lot of prom groups seemed to be there the service wasn't very quick to get to us.  Our server had a lot of parties going in and out and it seemed he forgot about is for a minute but he apologized profusely and was very nice and courteous throughout the night.  I only got a small serving since I'd had a pretty late lunch but it left me wanting more at the end of the night. The waffles were my favorite but that's probably because I prefer sweets rather than savory foods. The serving sizes are great and the drinks were right to my liking. I had a monitor which was divine next time I'm definitely getting a larger size."}
{"text":"Ed said come here for the chicken and waffles and so I did. The bumblebees seemed to be enjoying my cinnamon waffles and warm syrup as much as I did while we were all dining al fresco. The dark meat chicken pieces were moist but the white meat chicken pieces were a bit dry for my liking. LoLo's portions were hearty and generous. Maybe I'll order the shrimp and grits next time."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try this place so I was taken there for my birthday. Very expensive bland food stuff. Banana pudding is banana's in vanilla pudding. Anyone can do that! There is nothing appealing about the food, atmosphere, service or the price."}
{"text":"Great waffles, great chicken, great service, and great Thanksgiving-like afternoon nap after lunch.  Seriously don't eat lunch here if you have any important meetings within 5 hours. I am attracted and repulsed to this concept at the same time.  My body has decided that a place like LoLo's can only be enjoyed once a quarter.

I agree with some of the comments that this place doesn't retain some of the charm and South Phoenix anxiety of the original.  But the difference is small enough to not detract from the overall experience."}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's tickles me pink. I love everything about the place. The atmosphere and theme is awesome and unapologetic about it. For fuck's sake, there's an old fashioned looking sign that says \"kool-aid always on tap\". It's amazing.

Service was slower than I'd hoped and I never did get my beer, but everyone was very nice.

The food was good and worth the price. It felt like home cooking, it was hand food and I liked that. Next time I go I plan on coming in there with room to eat a lot because it was tops."}
{"text":"I am writing a poor review of Lolo's based primarily on the poor service that I received. I think I would have enjoyed my experience more if I hadn't been treated so poorly.

The place was busy when I came, but there was no wait and I was seated immediately. After being seated, I checked in on Yelp and waited for a server. None came. No one even acknowledged my existence. I looked at my Yelp check in time and 15 minutes had passed. I went to the hostess and asked what I needed to do to get a server. Rather than apologize, she made an excuse and said that the server was busy. I hate when people make excuses. Just apologize and fix the problem please. The hostess got me some tea and then the server came immediately. I ordered fried green tomatoes and chicken. Main course arrived almost immediately. Maybe 5 minutes after I ordered. The tomatoes, no where to be seen. I mentioned the tomatoes to the server and they showed up at my table when I was  halfway finished with the meal. I had planned on desert, I wanted to try the pudding, but the waitress brought me the bill before I was finished with the main course without offering desert. I asked her where I needed to go to order desert. She stared at me blankly and said, \"oh, you want desert?\" I told her no, it seems that it would be too much of a bother.

I will never return. I think if I had gotten an apology for the service then I would have been a bit appeased. No apology was offered by anyone. Not the hostess, not the server, nor management.

As for the food, I think if I were placed in a blind taste test between Lolo's and KFC, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Maybe it's because the service left such a terrible taste in my mouth, but I will never return to find out.

The only positives to my experience was that I liked the atmosphere and the waitress kept my glass full, which is the only reason I tipped her.

Okay, that's the end of my rant. I hope you all have a better experience than I did."}
{"text":"I love the food but damn every time we try to call and place a order no one Ever pick up the phone but when we call their other location they always answer in 2-3 rings. This is just getting rediculous then I have to drive 30 mins there and order and wait another 30 mins. They need to have a receptionist or something. YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO PLACE A ORDER WHEN CALLING."}
{"text":"I love Lolo's...both locations! This is about as soulful of food as you'll find in AZ. I love everything on the menu, especially the fried okra, greens and sweet tea! The staff is great, food is quick to the table.  I wish that they had some coupons though."}
{"text":"Food was good and the service we had from the server and hostess were very good. But we were seated at a table next to a huge party in a small room which would have been fine BUT they were all very loud and I couldn't hear what either of my friends were saying we couldn't even have a conversation with each other because if the noise and we couldn't hear our server. I understand that it wasn't his fault and they can't really tell them to be quiet but I am still docking them a rating because of this visit because I now have a headache because of all the loud talking and yelling that the other people were doing next to our table."}
{"text":"The food here was really good. I enjoyed almost everything I had. The only thing I wouldn't order again would be the Mac and cheese. If it were better I would have given them 5 stars because everything else was on point!"}
{"text":"This is one great restaurant and the service was outstanding. They have adjusted to the times and send you a text when your table is ready! The chicken was awesome and seasoned just right. I loved the sides, and they would give the legendary Roscoes a serious run for their money. I can't say enough about this place and will visit again when I stop through Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Love Lo-Lo's! this is my favorite location to go to. The food is always amazing. I usually get the same thing. Mix of catfish and fried chicken with mac'n cheese and cornbread. Never fails me. I don't care too much for the waffles. The service is also great there. The place gets super packed on weekends so if you go between 11-2 it's usually a 30-45 minute wait but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"I needed some comfort food while I was on travel for work.  Lo-Los was next to my hotel so I thought SCORE.  Uh nope.

The to-go counter girl was very nice.  That is what was good with my experience here.

I asked for all thigh meat.  It looked like a thigh but it was so dry I could barely swallow.  Seriously I've had waaaaaay better fried chicken from a grocery store.  And KFC blows Lo-Los away in the seasoning dept.  I' not sure there was any on the chicken it was that bland.

My mashed potatoes were too garlicy.  Wasn't expecting that much garlic in potatoes from this type of place.  Just wanted normal potatoes.  Corn was OK.  Cornbread was good.  But for a place that chicken is it's main menu item Lo-Los needs to step it up.  A Lot."}
{"text":"Chicken is great! Moist inside, crispy outside..waffle has a hint of something, cinnamon? Yum! Our waiter was great! Music was awesome, took me back to the 90's!"}
{"text":"Although I don't fully understand the Chicken & Waffles phenomena, I thought this place was really good. I'm not a huge fan of waffles (like them, don't love them) so I got the \"Lil C\", Two thighs and Mac and cheese. I also ordered a side of fried okra and a sweet tea. The chicken, Mac & Cheese, and Sweet Tea were all exactly as I hoped they'd be. The okra, not so much. First of all the server forgot to bring it, then when I reminded him he then forgot the Ranch that I ordered (otherwise he was a nice, attentive server). I'm giving a 4 just due to the okra issues, but honestly the food that I did enjoy deserves a five. I'll skip the okra next time and be pretty happy.

     This place has all of the fried chicken puns as well. \"Purple Drank\"? Did Dave Chappell write the menu? Hilarious.

     The food is reasonably priced but Dranks are pretty expensive. $3.50 for Kool-Aid? Get those refills!

     If you're on the fence about going here let me push you over. Go here! It's good! I didn't post any pictures because the #13 is already on there. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I came from out of town, drove 40 mins in a lyft to get here  and it was closed for construction for 1.5 weeks. It would have been nice if it was posted on the website or had something on their voice mail. I wasted over 40$ to be starving. Thanks :)."}
{"text":"I am visiting from California, and my BFF suggested we should try LoLo's. I was very hesitant at first because we have Roscoes back home - which is trash! So I yelped this restaurant and the pictures looked amazing, and the menu had variety. I ordered the chicken fried chicken, candy sweets, Mac & cheese, and cornbread. Food was BOMB, music was BOMB, everything here is 5 stars. I will definitely be back. This food is a MUST HAVE when visiting Arizona. I can't wait to come back!!  PLEASE OPEN A LOCATION IN CALIFORNIA!!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place and wanted to check it out! I'm a huge soul food lover and have been to many places back east. I had the catfish, chicken wing, Mac/cheese, and greens special! It was super good! Sides were amazing and the waiter threw in a side if yams. My date loved his meal! They have Kool-aid and sweet tea served in mason jars, super cute! We ordered a salmon cake to try, didn't care for it much. Great atmosphere in music! I loved it! Great service! Nice history of the owner on the wall. African American owned. Can't wait to go back when I'm in PHX!"}
{"text":"I've been eating soul since the sixties and a wide variation from sweet potato pie to catfish to greens and black eye peas. But the idea of fried chicken and waffles is a concept not of soul food to me. But nonetheless I'm game to try it. Had it before at another place and it was quite frankly horrible. 

So let's give it another try I say! I got two breasts waffle, red beans and some spinach. The chicken was so overcooked....damn. sent it back.

The red beans tasted like and looked like chili beans.....definitely not red beans.

On a positive side I got an awesome mai tai! Also has the manager come out and we discussed the meal. He was good enough to comp the meal. Thanks Markus!"}
{"text":"This place has a nice layout. Outside seating is nice to enjoy the weather in the afternoon, and watch the cars pass by while eating and conversating. 

Service was bery pleasant. Servers were nice, happy, sweet, and helpful towards our orders. 

Food was good! I tried something new, and it made me nervous. When i took the first bite, it was savory and flavorful. 

It can  get loud, but it was peaceful this time. 

So i would say this is perfect for food dates, and hangingout in general enjoying food. 

Would i go here again? Yes! This is my 7th time. I recommend this to anyone. I gave 4 stars only cuz i didnt feel it was a five star kick!"}
{"text":"This place is a good casual option for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Kids menu is a little sparse, but they love the Kool-Aid drinks. Regular menu has plenty to choose from, but mostly southern classics - salmon croquettes, mac-n-cheese, fried green beans, and of course Chicken & Waffles.  If you aren't interested in the fried items, they also have salads, burgers, etc.  I've had only one of their lighter options, the egg white omelet, which is extremely tasty.

Seating is plentiful and spacious.  But if you come on weekend, still expect a wait. Classic R&B in the background helps to set the tone.  Saturday afternoons they even have live DJs."}
{"text":"Went there with the hubby and 3 friends for breakfast yesterday and was very impressed. The restaurant was busy and active and the ambience was very diner-friendly. We had a waiter who was really friendly and a lot of fun, making us laugh and really being social. He really impressed us all with his ability to memorize everyone's orders and not have to write any of it down! He was awesome and we left him a pretty good tip.

Our food was really delicious. Everyone in our party liked what they ordered and one of our friends took the rest of their's home for later. I had the Lil' Jay, which featured a waffle and cheesy eggs and added a chicken breast to my order. Had ice cold Grape Kool Aid with it. My order was absolutely delicious and very tasty! Perfect amount of food for me and I came away feeling satisfied and content. It was a good meal choice to begin the day with and I was still full when I went to the Diamondbacks game later on.

I recommend this restaurant to anyone in search of something different."}
{"text":"This location is great!  We sat out on the patio since the wait for inside was almost an hour.  YIKES.  It was a good choice though... a little hot but the misters kept us cool.  

Love the drinks.  The Koolaid is great!!!  This time... I opted for an unsweetened tea with a splash of lemonade... delicious.

The service here is divine.  Seriously.  Everything you could want out of a waitstaff... attentive, friendly & always smiling.  It seems like a great place to work and that really shows.

I had the Betty Boop... consisting of a waffle & a chicken breast.  I'll just eat half, I told myself... and skip the syrup.  NOPE.  I drenched my waffle & chicken with syrup, inhaled the waffle & practically licked my plate clean.  No regrets.  Everyone gets a cheat day, right?

I'll be back, Lo-Lo's.  :)"}
{"text":"The worst service!  Waited ten minutes to be seated, nobody greeted us.  We went to a table, 30 minutes without anyone taking our order.  Will post more when and if the food arrives.
More later."}
{"text":"I lalalalooooooove Lolo's!! I always get the Tre-Tre's with a side of Mac n' Chs and it hasn't disappointed ONCE!
The service is confusing, I'm never really sure who to tip, it seems like I have multiple servers each time I go! Try not to go around lunchtime on a Sunday if you don't want to wait forever.."}
{"text":"i am a scottsdale resident, i have eaten in many restaurants in my 75 yrs, would i recommend this restaurant absolutely  a total rip off.prices out of sight.and food is not as good as roscoes in calif. management is not verycompetent.my wife and i were so disappointed we could not eat the food. also they did not offer to correct.or refund the money for the bill. i would not recommend to anyone..rip off"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum and yum.   Whatever's in these chicken and waffles... It's addictive.    You'll be smiling as you're stacking on pounds and hardening arteries here.  This is one of my favorite cheat day places to eat.  Tre-tre all the way!"}
{"text":"Quite surprised about this location for a few reasons. 1. The food here is actually really good! Granted, I ordered the $7 waffle & chicken drumstick plate (only two drumsticks) with a couple of IPA drafts, yet still good nonetheless. 2. Fun, fun atmosphere! There is a DJ that is actually quite good, and the music just puts you in a lively mood, be it at the bar or table. 3. The employess are in a good mood due to the atmosphere, and it just rubs off on you (the positive vibes & all).

This is more than just a chicken & waffle venue. This is a fun place, one in which I'll certainly return to."}
{"text":"My wife ate at LoLo's, brought home a dinner for me, chicken dinner. The chicken was dry and over cooked, no taste.  This dinner is not cheap, for the money, not worth it."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! 
The chicken is hot and delicious and the waffles are on point. I really liked how the drinks are served in BIG mason jars and their Arnold Palmer is great. 
The servers are really nice and helpful and the place is always busy but not overly crowded."}
{"text":"Delicious! Fried gizzards were amazing. Chicken was moist. Waffles were sweet and delicious. Would definitely come back again. The atmosphere and wait staff were both very pleasant."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times and I really like this place. If you are not in the mood for chicken and waffles, don't worry. They have an extensive menu that is sure to please various taste buds, and you definitely get a good bang for your buck. I indulged in a nice country style meal (pic below) and was thoroughly satisfied. I didn't feel as if I had missed out on the chicken and waffles because my plate was so good. For dessert, if you like banana pudding, definitely give it a try. It tastes great and has a good ratio of bananas to cookies. On top of that, it's served in a mason jar! 

Service here is great. However, if you dine in on a Sunday afternoon, expect to wait...like at all good restaurants."}
{"text":"Pretty much the only soul food in the stucco landscape of Scottsdale. The service and food is spot on for all things southern. Red velvet cake and grape koolaid are available here too. If you want some serious southern food, head to Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe (Lolo's grandma is Mrs. White). Love the pork chops and black eye peas! Both of these places are a local treasure!"}
{"text":"Great Waffles, chicken and my favorite----chicken gizzards, gravy and rice.  The peach cobbler was also great.  Only complaint I have is that the coffee, tea, and soft drinks--even though in large containers are too expensive.  One of the most friendly 'wait-staff' I've found in the city."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast after picking up my best friend from the airport. I had my toddler with me as well, but he's not super picky so I wasn't too worried. So let's get to the nitty-gritty!

The service: Excellent. Thursday morning at 10 a.m. and we were seated straight off in a nice comfy booth. The waiter was friendly and efficient and had great timing.

The food: DELICIOUS. I had the fried drumstick and thigh with waffle. The Amadi I believe. The chicken was hot, fried to crispy perfection and sprinkled with just a bit of salt. I tried the syrup on a bit of chicken and it was pretty damn good. The waffle was also very tasty. Thinner than I'm used to, but it totally works. Slight cinnamon taste to the batter, served with lots of butter and that tasty syrup. Normally I can't finish restaurant portions, but this plate was licked clean!

My buddy had the stuffed french toast and barely paused between bites. He said the presentation was unique (think rolled baguette, stuffed, fried, sliced and stood on end), and the taste was excellent. Not overly sugary, but sweet enough. I tend to think most places overdo the brown sugar and cinnamon in french toast, then compound it by drowning it in powdered sugar, syrup or caramel. Not the case here. The filling was like a vanilla cream cheese, just slightly sweeter, with fresh berry topping.

My son got kid's mac n cheese with bacon. In a rare moment of compliance he ate a spoonful without argument and then...WAS QUIET AND ATE HIS FOOD! Seriously, angels were singing. He couldn't finish the whole bowl, but at least he wasn't howling for \"Mickey Donald's\" within 5 minutes of leaving.

The 5th star is reserved for something mind-blowing, while this place is definitely great and a sure treat in the Phoenix area, I can't say it garners 5 stars. Enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"This place is not good at all. 2 people with me found a hair in their food, the service was really bad and it wasn't no where near pack. Last the food was trash! And they still charged them for the food and the server got real mad about it."}
{"text":"Grew up in L.A. Been to Roscoe's a ton of times and had more than my share of Chicken and Waffles. I've been to LoLo's several times and will go back again for sure. Best I've had in AZ for sure!

 Chicken is excellent, collars greens are top notch, corn bread is phenominal and anywhere with Kool-Aid ON TAP deserves a visit! Very, very good overall...but it could easily be AMAZING!

I wanted sooooooo badly to give this place 5 stars...I am a soul food junkie!!! But I just couldn't do it. Food quality is great and the staff is friendly...but the prices are pretty high. With just myself and my 8y/o son:$45+. 

Also, I was sadly disappointed with the waffles. They are flat and often come out luke-warm. A \"Chicken and WAFFLES\" spot should not have that problem. Last but not least, the Mac'N'Cheese was bland and average at best. 

As I said, LoLo's deserve a visit for sure...great grub without a doubt! Just bring your wallet."}
{"text":"I am sorry but everyone is raving about how great the food is and agree on that, but on a different note the customer service there SUCKS!! maybe the owners should take time to re-educate on how a customer should be treated, I've been there 3 times and I thought let me give this a 3rd try and again I wasn't disappointment.  The lack of acknowledging the customer and making them feel welcomed.  They take a long time to get your order, once you have your food not once do they stop by to ask if you need anything else, they were sure quick to bring the bill.  They don't smile and act as the customer is a burden.  NEVER again will  I go there,  to be treated like that when I spend my hard earned money NOPE, Not again.    I Hope this doesn't continue to happen to others, but I am diffintely going to spread the WORD!"}
{"text":"We arrived at Lo Lo's on a Sunday at 4pm. We found a fun looking place making a big success of the chicken and waffles concept. We thought it should be a light business that time of the week but soon discovered our mistake. This location seems to always be busy. By the time we were seated, received our food, paid our tab, and left it was 6:45 and the place was nearly empty.
In fairness there were nine in our party and a group like that doesn't just fit anywhere but it's still disheartening to watch people arrive an hour after you and get seated immediately. 
Food from the kitchen also was slow to arrive but, {and here is where the good news starts} it was very good!
We started with three appetizers, spicy corn fritters, fried green tomatoes, and fried green beans. I felt the beans were kind of bland but the corn fritters were tasty with the right amount of heat and the tomatoes were excellent.
I had decided on a beer and after ordering 3 different kinds with all being unavailable I settled for a glass of ice water. My co-diners raved about the sweet tea and kool aid drinks.
Most of my party ordered a variable of the signature chicken and waffles which we all enjoyed. My chicken tenders and waffle were very good. I like the breading and size of the tenders and the waffle was very tasty with a mound of soft sweet butter and a good syrup.
I would recommend Lo Lo's and would give it 5 stars if the service {which was good} wasn't so slow and parking were less of a problem."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. The food is amazing, the only reason why I took one star off is because the service is a little slow. We ordered our food as soon as we sat down because we knew what we wanted. Out waitress came back after 20 mins and told us the kitchen was backed up so she would bring us a free appetiser which she did. Our food came out and it was sooooo good. Would definitely come back here next time we are in town."}
{"text":"I am a fried chicken fan. 

In terms of fried chicken, Lolo's doesn't even make it to my top 10.  Nothing against the shop, which is run by really friendly people, but their yard-bird is not that flavorful once you get past the crunchy, salty, skin.  It may well be the best thing in Phoenix but that's not saying a whole lot.  Now mind you I'm comparing it to the likes of Price's Chicken Coop in Charlotte or the Scotch House in New Orleans - and compared to those esteemed joints - Lolo's is just bland.

That said, Lolo's will do you right: good waffles, solid collards, a tasty mac n cheese, grits, eggs.  If it was aiming to be a breakfast joint  it might score higher with me.  And their service is really welcoming.

But a drawback is their price.  For being the only game in town - Lolo's will stick it to your wallet.  It's very very easy to walk out of there 40$ lighter for a dinner for two.

Next time, I'll stick to the sides."}
{"text":"I love the soul food here but today was the first time trying Chicken and Waffles. They were pretty good actually I would get them again. The service was slow but again It was Friday night so pretty good."}
{"text":"Went to the one in the airport and was disappointed. The waffle was chewy/tough, which I think is impossible. So much promise, but disappointed in the result."}
{"text":"I was so hungry as a result of drinking the night before that, once we made it through the 1.5 hour wait, I ate the chicken without really enjoying it (or giving it time to cool off). BUMMER. Whose idea was it to come to Lo Lo's ON A SUNDAY? (mine). Those who could taste their chicken and remember said it was just okay. Some said they'd prefer KFC (gulp).

The waffles are too thin and soggy for my liking.

Everything is served with an ice cream scoop's worth of butter. I LOVE IT, screams the fat kid in me.

Kool aid and sweet tea are awesome. Fried catfish was tasty. 

I think people come here for the ambience more than the food, but I should go back and let it cool before devouring, and I need to try other things. Service is awesome in that no bullshit way, not the service-with-a-smile kind of way. I kind of like it."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the yummy southern food, waitress was very hospitable and the family love Lo-Lo's chicken & Waffles. Busy but worth the wait. Ordered the Tre-Tre and sweet candy."}
{"text":"Great place great food thank you to Jennifer and thank to Kat for telling us about this place we will definitely  be back thank you  ladies for a good time"}
{"text":"As if this place needs any more reviews. This is my third trip to Lo Lo's and as always it never disappoints. However on this trip something amazing happened.  What happened?  I'm glad you asked, \"the meet\" happened. Keenan King solidified my excellent experience with the following.  

As usual I ordered 5 wings and a waffle. Kind of my staple go to meal!  As Keenan brought my meal out he uttered the following, \"the wings are a bit small today so I had them throw an extra one on\"!  How effn amazing is that?  Customer service is still alive my friends!

Thank you Lo Lo's you continue to surprise me, much love!"}
{"text":"Was LoLos, now just SoSos. I was afraid this would happen when they moved to the bigger location. Quality that was always exceptional is now very spotty. Tried three times since the move. Disappointed twice. Probably will not go back. $3.50 for a glass of tea?  Really? Catfish is cut too thick to get completely done. Sad that now we have to go to Popeyes."}
{"text":"I'm in Phoenix for work right now and of course, I looked to Yelp for a good place to eat. Once again, I was not let down. The food was good, but more importantly, the staff was very polite, friendly and attentive. More restaurants need to take notes from Lo-Lo's customer service. I was greeted by three different people upon walking in. I feel like a lot of places lack that friendliness nowadays. Sometimes I feel lucky if someone even acknowledges my presence when I go out to eat.

As for the food, I ordered #10, side of mac & cheese and cornbread. I think I fell in love most with the chicken and corn bread. Also, the sweet tea is on point!

As I was shoveling food into my mouth, the owner or perhaps manager, comes up to me and asked \"you're eating alone?\" All I could do was giggle considering my mouth was full of fried chicken and mac & cheese. Sir, if I could've spoken at the time, I would've let you know that I would gladly sit alone, look like a loner and eat at your establishment because it's delicious."}
{"text":"Earlier this morning I took a trip to Georgia. Wait a sec... I never left Phoenix!

Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles is the spot to beeeee, when you want something hot, delicious, and savoryyyyy. 

Seriously though, the waffles were on point, the chicken was on point, the service and atmosphere were on point, and the hot sauce game was strong. 

Waffles: Buttery, soft, fluffy.
Chicken: Juicy, hot, tender, and seasoned well with just enough crunch.
Syrup: Syrup.
Hot Sauce: Exactly what hot sauce should be with chicken and waffles. 

If you have that craving (you know this craving), this is the place to satisfy your needs. 

Stop reading, you've made up your mind, just go and get lost in that sauce."}
{"text":"Went here for our \"date night\". The experience didn't disappoint.

The location was clean and we were greeted as soon as we opened the door. The hostess was cheerful and seated us right away. Our server, Latisha, greeted us within a minute or two and took our drink order. I got a grape Kool-aid and the hubby got a Blue Ivy cocktail. My drink was cold and tasted like my childhood (I don't drink Kool-aid really ever anymore).

We ordered the fried green beans as an appetizer. They were very tasty especially with the dipping sauce that came with it.

I ended up ordering the Phat Azz samich with chicken and a side of corn. Hubby got the red velvet pancakes and a chicken breast. The food came out before we finished out appetizer; it was great.

My chicken was crispy, crunchy, and juicy and the corn was delicious. Hubby liked his pancakes (I tasted them too and they were delicious).

The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the windows didn't seem to have shades on them and the setting sun made for a blinding experience where we were seated."}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's you are so ghetto fabulous I don't even know what to do with myself. Actually, I do: order the Tre-Tre, mac and cheese, and a side of cornbread. And just bask in the culinary amazing-ness that is fried chicken and waffles. That's right, I just said bask in reference to breakfast foods. 

Lo-Lo's is no ordinary breakfast fare; it can be enjoyed any time of the day. I prefer it after a few stiff drinks, when my cravings become insatiable. But let's get down to business:

Get the \"red\" kool-aid to drink. It's a little sweet, and I usually water mine down a bit. It's much better than the lemonade which is really tart. 

I like the Tre-Tre for my main entree because it comes with two legs that are good to da bone and very easy to manage. 

For sides, because I am like a ravenous animal at Lo-Lo's, I get the mac and cheese and cornbread. The mac and cheese is out of control delicious. It has baked cheese on top, and it is super creamy underneath the hard shell. I feel like a barnyard pimp when I eat the cornbread because of the large portion. It is very moist as well (I usually put a little syrup from the waffles on it.). 

You don't have to be hood rich to eat at Lo-Lo's either. Everything is more than reasonably priced. All in all, I love dis place!!"}
{"text":"Very good fried chicken, and good waffles.  Everything is fried southern comfort food.  Great stuff if you like that kind of stuff, and can handle it."}
{"text":"OK. Not bad, but not one of the top 5. Chicken was moist and not greasy. Waffle was well prepared. But nothing had any flavor. The chicken was crispy, but needed salt and the breeding was a little bland. And no flavor to the waffle either. So, fun place, VERY friendly staff and everyone seems to love it. I'm glad I came, just sorry I wasn't overwhelmed. Actually, I might be tempted to come back and taste other things on the menu. Lots looked tempting, but I was on a mission this time."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking so forward to going to this place as I have personally heard wonderful things about this restaurant. When we arrived there was about a 30 minute wait which is typical for a Saturday night. When we were seated it took about 15 minutes for our waitress to come over and ask for our beverages. After we ordered along with our beverages it took about another 10 minutes for us to receive those beverages. The wait time for our food was nearly 45 minutes and we had received it and we were missing condiments. Our waitress did not come and check on us until we were almost finished with the meal. I personally had the fish and chips with cod and I honestly it was one of the worst meals that I've had and I left the restaurant hungry. My husband had the boneless breast chicken and waffles meal which was ok. The waffle was really good but a few hours after we got home he was in the restroom throwing up. Based on this experience I will no longer go here again nor recommend it. For $40 you can definitely go somewhere else and get more value for your money."}
{"text":"Hype exceeds the quality.

Three of us went to the Scottsdale location this afternoon to get orders to go. Very crowded and noisy, but a happy noise. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We had the KK, the Baby Ray and the Chicken-Fried Chicken Platter. 
The food traveled ok; some of the chicken was still crispy; some was not crispy by the time we got home - 15 minutes later.
The chicken was good; about a 7. Gravy came with the Baby Ray; it was brown with lots of onions. Love the onions but would have preferred white gravy like my friend had on his chicken-fried chicken. Next time I will know better. The waffles were a 7 as well. They forgot the grits which was very disappointing to my grits-loving friend. Cost was $47 for the three of us. We don't think it was worth this much money."}
{"text":"I went there with family on a Sunday after church. I was visiting family in Az. We waited 4 hours to be seated then they served me Store brand frozen waffles. I'll stay in Long Beach, Ca Roscoes is where it's at."}
{"text":"Good Food.... HORRIBLE WAIT!!!! Disappointed. 2.5 hours!!! Would of left but I wasn't driving."}
{"text":"************************WEAR BIG PANTS************************

I had never had chicken and waffles together.  In fact, I don't think I've even had fried chicken outside of KFC and Hungry Man (I guess women don't get hungry?).  For a meal that did not involve a tortilla, I was pleasantly surprised.

I went with the Betty Boop, a breast and a waffle.  The chicken was juicy and perfectly fried to a crisp golden brown.  The waffle was delicious, although maybe I wish it were just a little crispier on the outside.  But the cinnamony goodness was complimented by a nice baseball-sized scoop of butter and plenty of syrup.  Of course, I had to have the mac & cheese, too.  It was some of the best I've had in a restaurant (I'm a little partial to Kraft I'm afraid to admit).  

We had a large group, and the staff was very accommodating and friendly.    But word of warning, they don't split checks for large groups and will only process two transactions per table (two credit cards or cash and one credit card).  Luckily I planned ahead and brought cash...and wore big pants."}
{"text":"Husband and I went for a date night and we were very satisfied! Service was prompt.  We ordered ice tea, betty boob and the hubby ordered the platter with 3 pieces of chicken with onion gravy with sides of coleslaw and waffles.

Food came out quickly enough.  My only complaint would be the ice tea.  It was sickeningly sweet! We had to ask for a glass of water to dilute it. 

The chicken was definitely as good as the hype.  Will be back"}
{"text":"I'm guessing everyone who gave this place 4 and 5 stars has never been to Roscoe's. I was really excited when I found Lolo's on Yelp because my bf had fallen in love with Roscoe's and I thought I might have found a Phoenix alternative. I looked at the menu online and it was a total Roscoe's rip off - super similar menu, names and descriptions (\"succulent breast\" anyone?).

The food here was good, not great. I thought the chicken itself was on the bland side and although it was nice and crispy, the crust seemed to taste almost burnt. My boyfriend thought it was dry. The gravy that smothered my chicken was also under seasoned and waffles were a little wimpy. My friend said his waffle was cold. 

However, I thought the service here was really great. They were very nice and helpful. I asked for gravy with my chicken and they forgot it, but were quick to bring me some. They ran out of drumsticks, so they gave my friend a wing - and when he asked for a thigh instead, they were very accommodating  although it didn't arrive until we were done eating. 

I would come back if I was in AZ and craving fried chicken, but considering the airfare from SF to LA is cheaper than to Phoenix, I think it's more likely that I'll be hitting up Roscoe's."}
{"text":"Frolicking through red fluffy clouds of cake that tastes like rich butter and encountering salty chopped nuts sweetly nestled in a layer or two of smooth cream cheese awesomeness, the first bite of Lo Lo's Red Velvet cake will send your taste buds on an adventure! 

People have been telling me to come here for a long time and I've been resisting the hype, but when I saw this cake featured on the front of Phoenix Magazine, I succumbed to the curiosity and made the trek from the far northwest valley here! What really surprised me was that red velvet cakes typically share an extra sweet flavor that is similar despite varying recipes. Here, the cake did not seem to have that overly sweet red velvety taste that I typically find. Instead, I was surprised with buttery fluffy goodness that wasn't overly sweet! 

The first combo, KK's combo, nearly killed me because I was beyond full after trying to eat it. Three pieces of fried chicken, two wonderfully flavorful waffles cooked to perfection, heavily buttered grits with over easy eggs covered in cheese and sautéed diced onions, and homemade syrup. I never had a chance! Our waiter was so nice enough to answer my defeat with a \"to go\" box and was in disbelief that I still managed to order the red velvet cake too. 

The ambiance is laid back and I recall gospel music playing and football playoff games donned on every flat screen there. All was right in the world! I drank my huge mason jar of sweet tea along with my hubby and smiled with satisfaction after dining on soulful comfort food in such a relaxed and cheerful setting!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for some solid soul food in AZ look no further than Lo-Lo's!  Obviously, you cannot go wrong with their chicken and waffles but what I go there for is there breakfast!  You cannot go wrong with there Banana Caramel Sweet Hot Cakes, and their Chorizo & Eggs.  If you want the go to breakfast item at LoLo's you have to get the biscuits and gravy!  You get a big fluffy flaky biscuit with thick country sausage gravy!  Just how i like it!  Lolo's is amazing for soul food but be sure to try out their breakfast.  You will not be disappointed.

{"text":"Food was great.  However, 1 star for the extremely rude servers.  We came around 1630, not a lot of people, probably 6 tables max.  We needed plates and napkins, had to wave to EVERY single server who just looked the other way, or blatantly ignored us.  I was so disgusted by their outright rudeness.  Our server was busy attending to her other tables....the other lazy severs just stood there talking to each other.  Do not go to this location!  What a disappointment!!  Shame on your 1600 wait staff this Friday, January 19, Lolo's!  Stop hiring lazy girls like these!"}
{"text":"The best fried chicken I have had. 
\"If\" they made you crawl over broken glass to get to your table, the chicken would make you say it was worth it. 
Nuff said!"}
{"text":"I have been a patron here for over five years, since before they moved to Scottsdale. I would drive down to PHX to eat their food at their previous location.

Good, solid soul food here. A bit over priced, but they have to pay the rent and the bills for their location. I have yet to try the gizzards, but I've had pretty much everything else on the menu.

Sometimes the fried foods are over-fried. Otherwise you will have a good fried food experience here. 

You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. 

This place takes the experience which I would previously have to drive to South Central LA to obtain, accessible to those who would otherwise not have that opportunity. In other words, it brings black people's food to white people, in a location and format that is acceptable to them. 

The system seems to be working with good success.

My advice if you've never been here before: avoid the chicken and waffles, and try something a bit more gritty and culinarily adventurous"}
{"text":"Iiight sooo.. I hunt BBQ and comfort food as I travel the US. This fried chicken is good but didnt blow me away. The koolaid-lemonade on tap was cool, the decor and ambiance were very comfort food-like..  staff were super helpful and sweet."}
{"text":"This a great place for Chicken  & Waffles, I am not a waffle person....but I must say the place is really nice and employees are very friendly, the menu is easy to read (although the hood descriptions is not good) they don't give the customer a option for replacement of the waffles which is in my opinion not good, but....all of the food here is a hit, I would recommend this place highly"}
{"text":"The food is good but not worth the unexplainable long wait. I've been here twice now and both times it has taken well over forty minutes to receive a simple breakfast. The bartenders are equally as slow and take a very long time to just take an order. The Bloody Mary is the worst I've ever had, and even the bartender admitted that the mix they use is crap. 

Also, having to pay a valet to go to a fried chicken restaurant is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Food critics call Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles the best soul food restaurant in the Valley. Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles is owned by Larry \"Lo-Lo\" White, the grandson of Mrs. White, the owner of Phoenix landmark Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe. Lo-Lo's is a celebrity favorite and has been frequented by guests including Muhammad Ali, Amare Stoudemire and Charles Barkley.

There were lots of tasty options but I thought I'd stick to what they are known for...chicken and waffles! The chicken was pretty perfect. Slightly oily, crunchy, well seasoned, moist taste. I'm pretty picky when it comes to finding perfect fried chicken.  I mean I'll eat KFC or Popeye's or Raising Canes but very rarely do I find this chicken. And paired with the waffles, you just can't go wrong. I've had this classic southern duo before and there's nothing that compares to the mix of sweet, crunchy, hot and salty.  And I had to add a side of mac-n-cheese, which was also very creamy and delicious!

Drinks are served in Mason jars and I got the kool-aid. I wasn't a fan of that, next time I'll get sweet tea."}
{"text":"Like what an idealized KFC fried chicken would taste like, and if they also served yummy thin waffles and syrup to go along with them. Yes, it did remind me of KFC, but in a good way, haha. Excellent crispy batter over tender dark meat; a thigh and drumstick w/ waffle cost me $7.60 incl tax. (Also amused that they sell koolaid here. :) Friendly service to go along with all that. Was a great bite while passing through Phoenix."}
{"text":"Amazing food with portion sizes that will have you rolling out the door. Staff was friendly and attentive. Very busy so be prepared to wait but well worth it"}
{"text":"Just a tip I just got informed that you cant park on the building near by, like i have been doing:) so just park near the houses if you cant  find a parking spot near the place"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken tender basket with a waffle.  Hot, fresh, cooked to order food.  The waffle was wonderful though the maple syrup is pretty thin.  The chicken tenders were perfectly cooked and quite god.  Here's the  problem - this is an airport and can you wait 15 to 20 minutes for your food?  And that wait was when they were not busy at all.  I don't think that pre-cooking and holding chicken and waffles would be an appetizing purchase so to do it right you have to wait - assuming you can."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing on every level. Best waffles best fried green tomatoes best fried chicken best lemonade I've had!! Everything was outstanding. Well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"\"You can't park there; hotel only.\" Is what you will hear when you park in front of LoLo's . Haha wth!  they do have complimentary valet doe.
I see you LoLo's! They step up their game with a new fantastic location-except parking of course- but wow the inside was beautiful. Not only do they have a bar now, the drinks are AWEsome! Props bartender 
I got the DD order. You know! Haha I asked for one of my fried breast to be smothered southern style and OrgasmMouthGoodness! Had to knock of a star due to the parking issues and waitress. God she was horrible. Seem like just her though because everyone there seemed happy. 
Job well done LoLo's. 
Moving on up!"}
{"text":"I woke up an hour later in the passenger seat of my own car, my window plastered with puckerings of chicken-greased flavored lipstick. 

Apparently, we had met up with Erica O for lunch at Lo Lo's. We drank sweet tea out of Mason jars. The menu had items named after characters from Spike Lee films. There was a \"Toy Toy\" and a \"Betty Boop\" in 'Crooklyn' right? I could swear there was a Sha Nay Nay in there somewhere.

I was told I had ordered fried chicken smothered in mashed potatoes and gravy. Yes. Smothered. As in \"served as one entity\". According to Misty S, I tried fruitlessly to eat the aforementioned mad creation with a fork and knife, to try and give our lunch companion Erica O the impression that I was not, in fact, a gluttonous fatty without dignity, as my mashed potato-flavored chicken was trying to suggest.

I had mentioned, before passing out in the car, that I found the waffles to be fluffy bundles of cinnamon joy. And that they tasted just fine without syrup, which was good, because I ended up getting most of my syrup on the damned fried chicki-mashed potatoes.

They had offered us dessert afterwards, which doesn't make any sense to me. If I had just eaten two syrup-less waffles and fried chicken soaked in mashed potatoes and covered in mis-aimed maple syrup, the last thing I'd expect is to be offered red velvet cake. But I'm sure at the time the idea seemed much more reasonable.

The food couldn't have been that bad, for though it gave me a \"food coma\" as the natives call it, I didn't suffer any intestinal woes.

The story sounded so fantastic and sensational I almost didn't believe. Surely I would've remembered dining in such a wonderland of soul food stereotypes. I was tempted to call Erica O and cross-reference Misty S' account with one of her own, but we were in the parking lot of Arrowhead mall and I needed a new pair of shoes. Or two."}
{"text":"I eat at the LoLo's on Central at least once a month. The chicken there is outstanding!  The airport location, one star.  Service is very slow, the breading on the chicken is tasteless, the  chicken is way overcooked and dry.  I think they pre cook the chicken.
Price is over the top too.  Why can't the airport vendors keep good standards and reasonable prices???"}
{"text":"Lolos is always excellent food and a really great atmosphere. The service is consistently poor. They seem understaffed and backed up constantly. I went in today at 1pm to order two meals to go. The girls at the front did not know how to process a to go order so they made me wait for 25 minutes to find someone who knew how to ring it in correctly. This is a great place but they need to work on treating their customers better."}
{"text":"Best ever. The staff are so wonderful and make you feel like part of the family. The food is to die for. Love the pancakes biscuits and if course the chicken and waffles cannot be beat. Make sure you go to the one just south of downtown as it is the best"}
{"text":"I've been salivating ever since I saw the words Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles grace the Albertson's grocery shopping plaza closest to my house at Thomas and Scottsdale Roads. The delicious soul food spot I've only ever been to in downtown Phoenix is coming to my neighborhood? Less than a mile away from Old Town Scottsdale?!?!

Yes, it was true. What my party noticed was how appetizing all the food looked. It's the same menu as the Phoenix location, and Peter got the Nay-Nay's ($8) with waffles, eggs and grits (my pal ordered a chicken breast, $4, too.)

He washed his meal down with a \"Jar of Drank\" of Kool-Aid ($2.50).

My table also got the Lo-Lo's ($11), with three pieces of chicken and two waffles.

I ordered sides of Mac N' Cheese ($3.50), cornbread ($1) and French Fries ($3.50).

The fries had chili powder on them and were perfectly thick-cut. It's a basket that's big enouch for the table to share, or gobble up yourself like I did.

The Mac N' Cheese cools quickly, so eat it as soon as it's served. The noodles were cooked well, and the cheese was thick-just forget any semblance of a diet you might have while you eat.

The cornbread was disappointing. It was too dry and crumbly and super-difficult to eat. Overall, though, my table loved the food and agreed it was worth indulging.

This Lo-Lo's is bigger than the original, and the giant mirror covering one wall just made it look that much more spacious. It also looked a little cleaner and more pristine than the one in Phoenix.

Service-wise: maybe it's because the place just opened, but the service was scattered. I think about five different people offered to grab us refills, but maybe with a few more weeks under their belt, Lo-Lo's wait staff will have tightened up the routine.

I'm so stoked that Lo-Lo's has opened up right by my house. It's rare for this plaza to have a sit-down restaurant."}
{"text":"I really do like the food here.  Stopped in for breakfast with a friend, and it is still just as good as I remember it being years ago."}
{"text":"Food was great! Kool-aid and sweet tea was diabetes in a cup so I needed some water to dilute it! Portions big had enough for leftovers!! Waitress couldn't tell me where they got their catfish from, (I'm from the catfish capital of the world) so I care about where it's from! Great family atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Couldn't love this place any more than we do. It's rare that out 3 kids and is all love the same place. Family fave for sure!

Best red velvet cake in town!"}
{"text":"This was my fourth time and last going here. I liked their food but their customer service was HORRIBLE! Everyone, the greeter, the cashier and even the owner were rude. I dk if it was b/c I had carry out or what it was but that was the last time they'll see me. I started this review on 3/9/2012. Sorry for the delay."}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles was a pretty good restaurant. The chicken was tender and everything else was flavorful. I though a bit over-priced for a specialty restaurant. Still good food though."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Definitely a must if in town. 

Great tasty waffles. 
They have bottomless mimosas for $14. 
A lot of vegetarian options.
Good service."}
{"text":"I promise that next time I visit, I will be ordering the amazing looking chicken and waffles, but this first review is for customer service and the omelets because they do serve food other than chicken & waffles! 

I loved this diner as soon as I stepped through the doors and was greeted by the incredibly friendly staff. Everyone here is so nice! The hostess gave us a hearty hello and the energy continued with the server. 

I ordered an omelet which is very hefty in size and tasted delicious! They have a brand new location which is spacious and friendly. You must visit Lo-Lo's and even if you don't want chicken and waffles, you can still enjoy other items! This breakfast is definitely large and in charge!"}
{"text":"I had heard how great the food was here, but.......I've had MUCH better.  The service was excellent, but my chicken was anorexic and overcooked.  $8 for about 5 bites of meat with no flavor.  Didn't care much for the waffles either - tons of butter and they are thin and spicy (cinnamon?) - which isn't what I'm used to.  The server was super nice and the food came out fast, but I doubt I'll return."}
{"text":"Waited more than an hour for our food.  Food doesn't taste the same, corn muffin was dry, chicken taste awful,  frys fried chicken taste better. Will not be coming back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly service and all thou can drink mimosas! Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"First time here, and don't let the drive there fool you!  Once inside the place is really current and stylish.  The service was friendly all the way through.  The crowd was probably as diverse as any (ANY) place we've been in PHX.  There was a live DJ playing a decidedly perfect mix of music.  We kept commenting on how truly cool and fun the place was, and like naturally- not forced! Some, but few people can pull that off and the same goes for restaurants!  The \"punch\" was tasty and fun, mixed w Kool-Aid!  The chicken and waffles were flat out great, and my partner from Louisiana agreed!  Can't wait to get back to try the amazing looking shrimp on mac-n-cheese.  Whaaat!
Go here..."}
{"text":"This place is tiny and its a liitle bit in the cutties...this is another one of them down places. So Foofoo warning in effect. 

Start with koolaid but get some water to cut it. This is the sweetest koolaid ever. Its good....i think the ratio is 1 jar of Water, one pack of koolaid, one pound of sugar! Lol!

The waffle is great. The chicken.....awesome. 

Desert was amazing! Banana pudding was off the hook.

Im mobile.so sorry i can't write too much more but this place is worth stopping at if you're ever in phoenix. Comfortable great music great food."}
{"text":"TOO MUCH HYPE!

I came here for my supervisors going away party and wasn't satisfied. I guess we should've made reservations because this place was packed. We had about a group of 12 and the wait time was around 15 minutes. Not too bad, it gave everyone time to look through the menu. 

Lolos appeared to have a decent variety of foods, including desserts. The prices range from $7 and up.

I ordered the Lolos which came with 2 waffles and 3 pieces of southern style chicken. The waffles were surprisingly thin about an inch and the chicken,  surprisingly large. I was told the chicken was really small, but you can share the portions for the most part. The chicken wasn't flavorful,  in my opinion it lacked salt just a tad would've helped. The chicken tasted pretty low quality. The waffles were very flavorful though,  I could clearly taste the cinnamon they'd used. The thing about the waffles I didn't like was the soggy texture. The texture could be due to the thiness of the waffle. I didn't try any of their famous Kool Aid so...but they get a star for their service...everyone seemed alright and helpful. 

Overall,  I think I'd expected something grander than overpriced bland chicken, and limp waffles. I'd rather get my chicken and waffles from IHOP...blasphemy,  I know, but it actually taste better to me."}
{"text":"So I spent a couple of years living in the south, from Mississipi to South Carolina, and I never thought I would find good southern comfort food west of Texas.  I eyed LoLo's for awhile on yelp, and heard commendations from friends, but I still had my doubts.

I finally decided it was time to see for myself.  So I ventured over to the area that is rumored to be a little sketchy.  And I can see why people say that.  But LoLo's itself is definitely a diamond in the rough.  And no,  they are not overrated.  Waffles with fried chicken and mac and cheese and red velvet cake.  Get It.  

Service was friendly and efficient.  They seem to be always busy, and the staff was on top of it.

With all the great reviews I don't need to go into too much detail, everything is just repeated a hundred times anyway.  But do come, and come prepared to stuff yourself."}
{"text":"They tried to make me go to rehab, I said Lo, Lo, Lo..

So it's Friday night, it's getting late, and there's a rumble in your tummy, where to go? Before you'd might hit up some fast food joint and regret it in the morning. Say good bye to those greasy drive-thru burgers and say hello to some down home soul food lovin' at the new location of Lolo's Chicken and Waffles.

Situated at the corner of Scottsdale and Thomas in what used to be a Kyoto Bowl, this is a welcome location to the neighborhood. It's the same delicious menu as the Yuma Street location and for me, just as tasty and deeply satisfying. 

Ordering the Lolo's Soul Food Platter ($13) is all about eating way too much way too late but with food this good I wouldn't order anything else. Your choice of fried chicken or fish plus 2 sides and cornbread, can be split between 2 healthy eaters and will be plenty to fill the tummy and the soul. The chosen 3 plump pieces of fried chicken, are so fantastically seasoned, and when smothered in gravy and onions is pretty much addictive pleasure. The sides are fantastically delicious, including the mac & cheese which is so rich and cheesy you'll probably order it every time. The collard greens are wonderfully tender and bursting with bitter sweet goodness. 

Dinner here just isn't complete without ordering you a hot buttery waffle ($4) to accompany your fried chicken. The tender sweetness of the waffle works really well with each savory bite of fried chicken, so much so that you might wake up early to come back for breakfast.

Who knew how these 2 components, which sound like such strange bedfellows, would work so well together? It really is a beautiful thing."}
{"text":"So I'm sitting here going through my Yelps and am dumbfounded that I have never wrote about Lolo's.. been coming here for a couple years now and when it comes to soul food, it aint much better than this! 

There isn't much I can add here but concur how amazing the fried chicken is.. the only sucky thing on the menu was the red velvet cake.. horrid but the cream cheese frosting was so great that you didn't notice that the cake sucked right away."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely terrible. Right when we sat down I could tell it wasn't going to be a good experience. First, they didn't even know who the waiter was and two different people asked for our drinks, they didn't greet our table and introduce themselves, they just asked what we wanted to drink with an attitude, then right after our waiter came and asked us for our drinks. Once he asked us for our food he didn't have any knowledge for the menu what so ever. He didn't ask me what I wanted for my side. Once we got our food it was so skimpy..I got the fish and chips and it had one tiny piece of fish, barely any fries and it was cold. For 12 dollars. My boyfriend for chicken and waffles, the waffle tasted like it was out of a bag and in a microwave, the chicken was just bone..two bites of chicken and he found a hair on it. The music was terrible and the service was even worse. I don't usually complain because I work in the restaurant business but it was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. I still tipped 15% strictly for the fact that I am a waiter and I understand not getting tipped is not ideal. 
If I could give this 0 stars, I would."}
{"text":"We placed a to-go order in advance.  We called at 11 am and arranged to pick up at 1:00.  When we arrived at 1, we had to wait an entire HOUR for our order to be ready.  They hadn't even started it!  They blamed it on their \"lunch rush\" but the service was absolutely appalling.  Another couple had been waiting a long time for their order as well and were really frustrated when we walked in.  We finally had to flag down a manager who had only been working there 3 days and she didn't know what to do.  She ended up giving us a discount but it really didn't make up for the fact that our order was an entire hour later than promised.  All of the employees looked flustered and scattered.  They need to work out their systems.  I know this is a new location but I would imagine they would have moved the staff when they moved the restaurant as it's only 2 blocks away from its previous location.  There was no direction at all.

The food overall was decent but I would not go back due to the appalling lack of service."}
{"text":"I LOVE Lolo's; however the food at this airport location was not representative of the Lolo's brand - not by a long shot. The fish I had was bland, the greens tasted like something out of a can (with no after-market \"help\") and the potato salad was just disgusting. Not happy with my $20 investment."}
{"text":"I just experienced this restaurant for the first time tonight and I have to say I was very skeptical at first.  Chicken and waffles couldn't possibly go well on the same plate..  But it was amazing!  Delicious!  And the employees were all very fast and efficient.  Every person greeted us with a smile and I left with absolutely no negative thoughts. I'm going to recommend this restaurant to everyone!"}
{"text":"I checked this restaurant out last year the last time I was working in Phoenix. I really wanted Chicken & Waffles for breakfast and the Clarendon Hotel I was staying at used to have this item on their menu. Since I had the craving for Chicken & Waffles the nice staff at the hotel recommended Lolo's Chicken & Waffles. I was not disappointed, the food was amazing, the service was attentive and friendly. The only thing I didn't like was the over one hour wait to get a table. After being seated in the restaurant I can see why seating is an issue, this place is a converted small house and the dining area is limited. The Fried Chicken & Waffles my friend and I had along with the cornbread, mac n cheeze and the Iced tea & Lemonade combo was off the hook. I will be in the Phoenix area again this weekend and since reviewing this restaurant here I noticed a new Lolo's location in Scottsdale which I will be hittin\" up!"}
{"text":"I cried.

I pushed the passenger car seat back, unbuttoned my jeans and if I could have unbuttoned my skin, I would have. We had an emergency stop at Wal-Greens for Lactaid, Tums, Bean-O, and Ginger Ale. I even made my bf buy this hideous stained glass candle holder (at WAL-GREENS) cause I thought it was \"cute\"-that is how out of my mind w/pain I was. I laid down on the bed and asked for a barf bucket. Just in Case. And did you see what I gave this place? Yeah. Five muthaf'n stars. Don't be a pussy. 

I racked my brain all day, trying to come up with a good Phoenix-y place to bring my BFs dad who had driven all the way from Bakersfield and was surely hungry. We needed a place that at 8:30 on a Friday gonna be open and not insane. He is a down home, steak and taters guy, and I am a nervous nelly sophisticate whose lactose intolerance and mostly vegetarian tummy stumps restaurants . And I was hungry after a long day of work. I looked up the menu at work and saw they serve b-fest all day. Oh good, this way I could avoid all the meat, get the waffle, and avoid all \"oh, you don't like meat\" conversation I hate.

Easy enough to find (take the 60 to 17 if you can to avoid Light Rail hell from the 10), we found parking on the street and walked right into the restaurant after seeing the bright neon sign with a mighty Sassy Chicken on front! We were seated immediately (I have no idea what people were talking about regarding the wait- we were lucky is all I can wager) in the same room Kristin C. was: the only four person table besides a two person one, where they have the soda machine, extra canola oil, cash register and silver ware and the kitchen where the amiable cooks sauntered out drinking sweet tea and eating the food. I liked the little hutch over our table with various black studies books. I liked the famous signatures tagged all over the place. 

I looked over the two-paged laminated menus-and was stumped. I forgot they had fish tooo....and sides...and omg. I guess the staff is used to a long decision making process, cause they hooked us up on the mason jars of sweet tea (holy shit is it GOOOooooOOOD). We all decided on the platter since it affords you two sides WITH cornbread, and the platter rings in only at $12.50 for battered chicken (3 pieces) or Codfish or Catfish with two sides and cornbread...whhaaaa-considering most sides are at like 3.50...I got the cod (go MA pride!), waffle, collard greens, cornbread. Tim got the chicken, waffle, home fries and his dad got catfish, waffle and homefries. After placing the order (I was gonna get fried okra but since the greens aren't cooked with ham, I went for 'em), it came within ten minutes-like FAST.

We all dove right into the waffle (I scooped off the butter immediately on to a separate dish in hopes of saving myself a little) and all agreed it was the best waffle ever.

\"This waffle is good.\"

\"Yes, it is\"

\"Oh my...I just had the waffle and it is GOOD.\"

five minutes later

\"This waffle is really, really good.\"

ten minutes later

\"I can't believe how perfect this waffle is\"

It was like fucking Groundhog Day with this waffle, I couldn't picture a better waffle-not too doughy, not too nutmegy, not too crispy, not too buttermilky, not too cinammonly, not too eggy, not too airy, the little waffle indents weren't too deep or shallow for optimal warmed maple syrup lovin', and I ate the whole damn waffle. My lil' waffle of doom.

I could only manage to eat one piece of Cod (it was as big as my face) and the crunchy, flavourful (but oddly not spicy) batter was perfect with the hot sauce on the table. The cornbread a moist muffin of pure delish-a real compliment, not a star, but a perfect compliment to the rest of the palate. I loved my collared greens and it was spicy, and vaguely sweet, and I ate it gingerly it was that good. In fact even thought I stuffed myself, I still had a whole piece of cod, a 3/4 of a cornbread muffin, and almost huge bowl of collard greens left over.

We really wanted that red velvet cake so seductive under the glass dome case on the counter, but as we sat there drinking our refills, the pain started and the dreaminess and sleepiness and regret. 

Our guest loved it, kept complimenting me on it (and didn't notice my bizarre eating habits), Tim mentioned if he lived near by he would gain 5,000 pounds, and I can't wait to come back on a weekday early afternoon to have brunch w/the waffle and GRITS...yummers!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best brunch! I love it here and always get the chicken and waffles!! YOU HAVE TO. Everyone is so nice, even my 3yr old loves it here."}
{"text":"Whenever I want to throw all of the healthy eating out the window for the day and succumb to the deliciousness that is soul food I make a visit to Lolo's. I have visited this location and the original location several times since moving to AZ and the food has been pretty awesome at both places. I usually get the \"toy toy\" 2 wings and a waffle..if you're lucky they sometimes throw in an extra wing at no charge! I'm a sucker for anything sweet and salty so the crunch and saltiness from the chicken mixed with the buttery sweetness of the waffle and syrup is heavenly. Yes I will admit the service is slow but if you go with a group of people you will hardly notice :-) 

Being that I'm a SoCal girl I naturally have to compare Lolo's to Roscoe's and might I dare say that they are almost equal in my book."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I am from Houston and I love to try different food when I travel. I will definitely come back to this place and let everyone back home know how amazing the food and service here is. 

I had the shrimp and grits and my company had chicken and waffles with a side of Mac an Cheese which was omg great! 

And I can't forget the lolo punch ... AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Epic fail at chase field location opening day 2015-fried green tomatoes were red tomatoes and after waiting 15 minutes got them barely warm-manager asked if i wanted to wait and they would cook more-no and hell no i watched them cook my order and grease wasn't hot is the issue-retrain your staff representing your restaurant...pitiful show for opening day...go back and have grandma show you again"}
{"text":"The food and the service are the best! Seriously, the nicest wait staff & the best damn food you'll ever have. They also happen to play my life's soundtrack. Best music ever."}
{"text":"Where do I start. Upon arriving, we signed in and were told there was a one hour wait. The reason I did not rate them a 5 is due to the long wait and lack of standing room for those waiting. Otherwise, the experience was excellent. Our server was Monique and she was hospitable and friendly. We asked her for suggestions and she gave us genuine responses. Although it was busy, she did not rush us. The amazing part was that our food took no longer than 10 minutes to arrive. I was blown away. They have a large menu, but are still able to complete orders in such a short amount of time. And the food was hot and tasty. I ordered the smothered chicken and yams and fried okra. The chicken was mouth watering. I could not eat it all. I will definitely be going back. I didn't order waffles this time, but I will when I go back."}
{"text":"Surprised on why this place is rated so high.  We had the betty boop and the biscuits and gravy.  The things I liked about the dish weren't even the main stars.  My side of bacon was cooked perfectly.  The chicken and waffles...ok.  Biscuits and gravy...ok.  I got some scrambled eggs and those were cooked perfectly.  Guess I'll go back for eggs and bacon!"}
{"text":"Sunday afternoons are extremely busy at this Phoenix location. We had 12 in our party last Sunday. Four in our party arrived early and were seated. The remainder of our party was en route. Some were pulling in the parking lot looking for a space. One of the four made a call to find out how long it would be before we would arrive. We stated we were in the parking lot. By the time we parked, the four were standing outside the restaurant. They had been told to give up the table. They asked to speak to the manager since the rest of the party was parking. The manager arrived and said, \"Get the fuck out, this table will not be served\". We did get out and will never ever return to the Phoenix location."}
{"text":"The wait was not too bad to be seated. 20 min or so. Once seated thought it took really long for our waitress to take our order. Once the order was put in our food came in a timely manner. The food, which is the most important thing was awesome! The waffle was superb and the chicken had the best batter and was very juicy. The only thing that could have been done better was the cheesy grits. I will definitely be back for the chicken and waffles. Total star of the show."}
{"text":"Came to Lolos Sunday morning. First time coming here I expected great service and amazing food. Service was really poor and the wait was super long not only did they take about 30+ min to sit us our food took over 40 min to come out after ordered, not once did we get an apology!! As for the food it was ok! Coming from working in a restaurant environment customer service should def be a top priority."}
{"text":"Like any good Canadian knows, nothing goes together better than Tim Horton's coffee and a honey cruller. As it turns out, here in AZ, nothing goes better with fried chicken than crispy waffles!
I have driven by Lo-lo's many times. Having enjoyed chicken and waffles at the famous Roscoe's in LA years ago, I kept meaning to give this a try. The only trouble is unlike years ago, I'm now trying to avoid fried food, as well as wheat so the concept of eating fried bird and fried batter was a conundrum to say the least.
I decided after 6 months of staunch resistance to let my hair down and give Lo-Lo's a try.
I went for lunch on a weekday. The place is directly south of downtown, in a fairly sketchy area. Despite the location, it was PACKED! It's always busy. Here's why:
It's billed as a soul food place however there were guys in suits and ladies out for lunch and families and singles like myself. Good soul food attracts a diverse crowd. Seems we might solve the worlds problems by having everyone discuss international conflict with a belly full of soul food. 
The service from the moment I walked in was fast and friendly.  I got a table right away. My Server was a fun and spunky young woman named Jerri. She brought me an ice tea: huge mason jar! Seemed all the beverages are served this way to ensure no one needs endless refills. 
The menu is colorful and tongue in cheek, with plenty of Ebonics word play. Being 25% black, I managed. Though my Canuck heritage kinda cancels any of that out!
I opted for the standard 3-piece fried chicken meal with 2 sides. One has the gravy and onions option, but for my first visit I needed to taste the bird as it comes from the fryer! As I don't eat much carbs these days, I chose spicy collards and string beans with red potatoes.  
The food is delicious. It's not fancy. It's not trying to be something other than what it is: down home Southern delicious! The fact that most of the chicken and sides are ready to go back in the kitchen, I had my plate hot and in front of me in about 3mins flat!
I chose to eat the cornbread as the heck with the carbs my black side wanted that bread! I poured out some of Lo-Lo's signature hot sauce, added a bit of honey and it was on like Donkey Kong! I savored every crispy, spicy, delectable bite!
The way I eat chicken is pretty simple: If I can chew or crunch it, it's going down the chute: skin, meat, cartilage, wing-tips, you name it, it's gone! I love eating chicken with my wife cuz I get to eat twice once she's done. \"You're not finishing that?!\" I inquire looking at what to me amounts a 2/3 eaten morsel reaching for it...she has learned to simply look away and block out the chilling sounds of a carnivore devouring its crispy, salty prey.
Once I had finally eaten every possible scrap on my plate, Jerri came by and looking at the meager remains on my now barren plate, asked with a wry smile \"You gonna eat the bones too or are you finished?\" I said \"My only regret is that I don't have an extra stomach or I would order round 2!\"
If you want a real down home, down south, downtown fried chicken experience with our without waffles, get you DOWN to Lo-Lo's. You'll be back! 
I'm down."}
{"text":"Imagine that KFC and the Waffle House had a baby....well, you would get a Lo-Lo's. That description is accurate but does not really do justice to how good the food is at Lo-Lo's. Plus you can't get Kool-Aid  at KFC or Waffle House. The waffles are really where its at! The chicken is maybe a little above average, but it does have a little kick to it.

I had the Lo-Lo which was 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles. The waffles were fantastic. They were large, soft, and golden, done just right. The chicken was a little spicy for my taste and I found myself putting more syrup on it, which actually turned out to be a good thing. 

The side orders were a good size and I would recommend the fried okra. Overall everything was good, but overpriced in my opinion. I mean it is just chicken, waffles, and Kool-Aid that cost $20 with a tip per person."}
{"text":"Being in town for Spring Training I didn't know where to go, so I turned to Yelp for help.  This is by far my favorite meal of the trip.  Ariana was our server and was very pleasant.  She answered all our questions and even humored us with some great stories.  

I got the platter, which included 3 pieces of fried chicken with gravy on the side, corn bread and 2 sides (waffle and collard greens).  I was defeated...   The portions were huge.  It was sooo good though.  It was great having the bottomless jar of drink.  I suggest the kool aid.

Overall it was a great experience.  I met some nice people and had a very satisfying meal.  I also picked up a pretty sick shirt.  The front says \"Eatin' Good-N-Da Hood\"!  I will rep it all the way in Cali!

This is one place I will be sure to come back to my next trip to AZ."}
{"text":"The hype for this place was off the wall!! \"It's better than Roscoe's\" \"They're chicken is soooooo goooood!\" and so on and so on, so whilst on vacation I made my first visit along with the hubby and some family. While I've never had Roscoe's to make the comparison, I have had The Breakfast Klub in Houston and DIED over their delicious chicken, waffles and grits so I was looking to be just as wowed. 

All I can say is, it was all hype. Sorry!!! I know Arizonians everywhere just fell out of their chairs!! It just wasn't amazing, or even kind of good, it was just OK. 

We went on a Sunday morning for breakfast. The service was good, we beat the Sunday church crowd so it wasnt overly packed but I was kind of shocked at the size of place, pretty cramped but I guess I'll give it cozy. 

So we order, I love that the drinks come in HUGE mason jars (not so good for those wasted calories on SUGARY drinks) and get the chicken breast and wing with a waffle and a side of grits. Boooo!!!!! My grits were soup, I had to season them well to get some flavor and despite letting them sit for a little to see if they'd solidify. . . .no go. I was sooooo dissappointed. 

Moving onto the main dish, I dont love chicken skin but I understand the allure in the fried variety so I indulge from time to time. This time I went for it and tasted. . . .salt. Lots of salt. Double booooo!!! The breading was fine, not to thick or gummy when it hit the syrup but still too salty for me. So fried skin removed, chicken doused in hot sauce, I enjoyed the remainder of my dish and ordinary waffle and was thoroughly full but not too satisfied. 

Overall, Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles was just that, chicken and waffles and nothing to spectacular at that. 3 stars for being an ok chicken & waffles joint with good service and decent prices."}
{"text":"Service was great food was excellent, Steve was our waiter he was awesome. The only downfall was the hostess had a bad attitude when we walked in"}
{"text":"Great service and ambiance.  Food is very good, but would recommended the pork chops be marinated in a brine before cooking for tenderness because they were very tough.  Chicken, waffles, Mac & cheese, shrimp & grits, banana pecan pancakes are all really good and highly recommended."}
{"text":"so i'm waiting to get my taxes done and it was either the noodle house or lo-lo's. since we constantly eat nothing fried, no salt, no fat, pretty much all veggie, i needed to splurge. stepped inside and MY insides started to growl!

had the cod plate with grits and a waffle. why does the sweet waffle go so well with the salty fish? for whatever reason, it does and i left stuffed and satiated. good think i have the hospital on speed dial because i needed an immediate coronary artery bypass graft afterwards!"}
{"text":"Such a fun place!!! Food is delicious. Bottom line. Make sure to share sides so you get to try them all! Drinks are sugar filled in giant mason jars and chicken is juicy. Love the atmosphere and very worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The span of time I wait to visit this place is usually a few years. When I first moved to Phoenix and they were downtown off a side street, then when they moved into the spot off Thomas and Scottsdale, and now their very fancy space after franchising off Thomas and Osborn. 
The ambiance will never be the same. Their old old location reminded me of the backyard fish fry in Georgia....kinda dirty but always good and greasy. He'll, now they offer \"healthy\" options.
I treated myself to their fried catfish plate. It came with 2 sides. The catfish is light and flaky and their batter is just plain ass great. It's like a mix of cornmeal and flour...slightly salty but I like it like that. Dabble some of that hot sauce on there and you've got the perfect meal for a fish fry.
But then there's the sides. I had the greens which I love but rarely cook because they take so long. Their greens are a little more al dente....not crunchy but definitely not soggy like I'm use to. I thought they were great the way they prepared them. Then the cheese grits. No lumps...just smooth with sprinkled cheese and butter, the way cheese grits are supposed to be cooked. 
The server was sweet as peaches and talked me into some banana pudding. I like it but it needed more  wafers. 
Service was wonderful. Considering everything I ordered is poor man's food...it was a bit expensive...I mean catfish, collards, grits....put you back maybe 5 bucks? But I would pay again for this little slice of soul food again."}
{"text":"Nice gingery dense thin waffles. Standard fried chicken. Didn't live up to the hype."}
{"text":"Went to Phoenix with my baby over the weekend. He asks, \"Baby wat u wanna eat?\" I thought about it and said, \"fried chicken, boo.\" Baby goes to get the food. When he comes back I'm looking at him like he's the LAST chicken wing on the table...\"WHERE DA FOOD AT???\" He hands me my container, which I almost drop cuz I ain't expectin that much food! I open and much to my delight...3 juicy (NOT greasy) pieces of chicken, greens, mac n cheese, and some good-ass corn bread. Baby wasn't lyin when he said this place was GOOD. He's from the South, so I knew to trust his judgment. =)  Can't wait to go back to Phoenix so I can have some mo' of that good good...food. LoL. ;-)"}
{"text":"The best soul food in Arizona.   My only gripe is with the desserts.   The banana pudding at this location is never fresh.    Banana pudding made in large quantities is good for 24 hours.   The vanilla wafers should not be soggy and the bananas should not be black.   #ijs.  Conversely;  this location has infinitely better service than central and central has better dessert than Scottsdale.    You do the math."}
{"text":"It was my wife's birthday and we were trying to think of a place to go for lunch.  We were on our way to run an errand in north Phoenix and my wife suggested Lo-Lo's.  I know...chicken and waffles...how can that be a tasty lunch???  Well, it works surprisingly well together.  We've had Lo-Lo's in Phoenix before but we never tried the location in Scottsdale.  The parking lot was crowded and when we arrived there was a 10-15 minute wait and this was about 1:30pm so it should've been after the lunch rush.

We were seated at our table.  The place is very noisy which makes it difficult to carry on a conversation.  We looked over the menu and our waitress arrived after about 5 minutes.  We all ordered Kool-Aid to drink since this is the only place I know of that actually serves Kool-Aid as a beverage.  It was a nice flashback to childhood for both my wife and myself.  I do suggest getting a water as well because the Kool-Aid does kind of give you a sugar overload.  We ordered a Tre-Tre (2 drumsticks and a waffle) for the kids to split and my wife and I each ordered a Betty Boob (1 breast and a waffle).  We also had a mac and cheese side that we could all split.

The food took about 10-15 minutes to arrive at the table.  Each plate had a little cup of syrup for each of the waffles.  The chicken was breaded and fried.  Each table has hot sauce and ketchup.  I tried a bite of the chicken and it was very good.  I liked the seasoning and the breast was very tender with a crisp outside.  I then tried it with a little of the supplied hot sauce and it went very well with the chicken.  It was a perfect combination.  I moved on to the waffle.  I covered it with butter and the supplied syrup.  It was fantastic.  The waffle has a slight cinnamon taste which worked very well.  My wife and kids all had the same thoughts with their food.  We had a very enjoyable time and will definitely be returning.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a delicious and different meal."}
{"text":"So FAR the best chicken waffles and sides of the West coast. I was not impressed with the macaroni and potato salad but otherwise still the best. Roscoes was not as good in my opinion as the chicken was dry. Here it was juicy, tender, and very moist."}
{"text":"I'm African. And I came in with my white boyfriend. They sat us in the back back corner. The service was not exactly rude but uncomfortable. Towards the end we did feel a bit ignored. Also the stares. This was all being done by the staff. 
Interracial couples beware"}
{"text":"So my new obsession lately has been soul food and I knew I had to check this place out. I have never had chicken and waffles (something about sweet and sour mixing altogether just threw me off) but my girlfriends told me I'd be a simple minded b**** not to try it out. Okay, fine, bring it out.

... along with the soul food platter, which consists of one HUGE piece of catfish, one piece of chicken (your choice on which part you want) smothered with gravy and onions, two sides (get the mac & cheese/beans over rice) AND CORNBREAD! 

After several of my arteries clogged and I couldn't breathe, we paid our bill and swore this would be our new Sunday spot. It will be yours too!"}
{"text":"I'm here in Phoenix visiting my aunt uncle and they took me to this wonderful restaurant. I got the chicken and waffles and I am so glad I did, it was delicious. Get a side of mac & cheese and some fried green tomatoes, you'll be glad you did! Yum Yum.  When you're here ask for Richael she was wonderful!"}
{"text":"wait was 40 mins, its understaffed , the food is not that great ! stick to roscoe's people!"}
{"text":"Satisfying as usual with the fried chicken tasting delicious. Service was a struggle today but I'm sure the gal was new."}
{"text":"The chicken was amazing, tropical koolaid was even better! Really enjoyed the waffles that had a hint of cinnamon. I will forsure be back again to enjoy this place again! Even thinking about taking my family here for my birthday!!! Love the environment and delist food."}
{"text":"Service reused at LOLO's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I tried to called in a order at lolol's and was REFUSED SERIVCE!!!!!!!!!! I was told that they do not take pick up orders on Sundays. I work 3 mins away, I then asked if I could come in and place the order, pay for it then return for the food. The answer was NO!! I proceeded to ask to speak to the manager. After being placed on hold, a young lady took the call stated that she was not the manager but she was directed by the boss to confirm: \"NO orders for pick up!\" and No coming to the resturant to order and wait for food as pickup! 

How about updating your website and menus!!!! And letting people know you refuse service when ever its convienent for you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a professor that was always raving about this place. I'm the person everyone can count on to order chicken everywhere I go, so I knew I needed to see what all the fuss was about.

I honestly can't believe it took me as long as it did to come in! This place is amazing! I'm not a huge fan of waffles in general, but figured I needed to try it once. They were so good! The chicken strips were moist and flavorful, without being greasy. The kool-aid was an added bonus! 

My next trip in, I tried the macaroni and cheese, and fries instead of the waffle. Both were great as well! The macaroni was smooth and perfectly cheesy, and the fries were seasoned to perfection. My friend had the Double D, and that was great as well.

I highly recommend this place; I've been talking about it non-stop to my parents back home, and can't wait for them to come into town so I can take them here.

My only complaint would be the parking lot. I mean really? Valet for that tiny parking lot really doesn't make sense. And it's annoying trying to find somewhere to park on a Friday night."}
{"text":"In town visiting family (August 19, 2016) and they recommended this restaurant.  As usual, before I headed over I took a moment to read the Yelp reviews.  How in the world does this place get such good reviews?  

We were a party of three adults and a baby and were told the wait was going to be 15-25 minutes. A party of 12 came in after us and were seated before us. Our wait was the full 25 minutes.   The woman at the front desk asked for a name to call when it time to be seated.  I said \"Darian.\" She repeated back Victoria. Umm no Darian, she laughed and said not even close huh.  She called out Dirk when it was time to be seated. If they turned the music down just a little bit (not too much because I loved whatever station they were playing) they could possibly hear their customers a little better.  The front desk person was wearing a t shirt that read \"Ghetto Fabulous\" on it.  Ghetto, for sure, fabulous was still something to be seen.

The food - Overrated and way too salty - so salty you can see the salt simply sitting on the Stupid fry.  My son loved the catfish sandwich and my daughter was sick from the tre-tre (two drumsticks and a waffle) less than 30 minutes after leaving the restaurant.  Serving the drinks in various sized mason jars was a creative touch - mixing all of the alcoholic drinks with Kool Aid is once again ghetto.  The drinks are super strong (maybe because they are mixed with Kool Aid?) I didn't have the waffle but just looking at it, I wasn't impressed.

The service -Lots of Lo Lo staff simply walking around aimlessly, chatting with the folks at the front door, walking in and out from the patio area, cackling it up with each other, not doing much of anything really.  I will say that our server is what made me give this review two whole stars.  She did a good job and you could tell (besides her telling us) that she was very busy.  She took our drink order and told us that she is also our bartender, so please bear with her but she will be back as soon as she can.  She brought the drinks and 20 minutes later came back with water and finally took our food order.  Same long wait followed by what appeared to be sincere apologies when we asked for more napkins and a take out box. She was very accommodating. Turns out she was also our cashier. Her name was Shamreya.   I ended up giving her the full tip that was \"suggested\" on the bottom of the receipt out of pity, quite honestly.

Parking - one word - SUCKED

Besides getting sick, my kids (young adults themselves) actually liked this place - maybe because it appeared as if it was managed by young adults.  Looks like this restaurant stays pretty busy so they won't notice that I will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"It was our first time finally trying Lo-Lo's. I got the fried chicken and waffles and was a bit disappointed. The fried chicken was dry and not flavorful.  The waffle was great and huge. It may have just been that batch of chicken that was overcooked, but I wouldn't get the fried chicken again. We also got the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and that was wonderful. The chicken was cooked perfectly, the gravy had an amazing flavor and the mashed potatoes were phenomenal. I'd highly recommend getting that."}
{"text":"Dear Lo-Lo's why do you have to be so damn good!?  I really wish that when I had you last weekend you had been dry and tasteless so that I wouldn't have to come back and eat Fried Chicken and Waffles again... but now you have made me an addict to your delicious mouth-watering juicy breasts & thighs... Woah where is this going?! LOL Thank goodness you do takeout for now my husband will have to do his husbandly duty and pick me up a piece or two on his way home from work.... 

Truly wonderful... I never had waffles with fried chicken before and I'm not sure why I was so surprised at how great this pairing would be but I was... Great service, everyone was friendly and upbeat and seemed to actually enjoy working there which is definitely a PLUS! ;-) I love you Lo-lo's!"}
{"text":"I was down visiting a supplier and asked for a good breakfast spot.  Of course they suggested LoLo's.  Never hearing about it nor having chicken and waffles; I said let's go check it out!!!   Once here I have learned they are famous for their chicken and waffles and boy; they did not dissapoint!!!   The staff is very professional and friendly.  The establishment is clean and family friendly.  The food is amazing.  I think I have found my new favorite breakfast...  Chicken and Waffles at LoLo's!!!!!    It's a must have"}
{"text":"Over priced!!!
Do better chicken and waffles at home.
No BBQ chicken!!!! WTF!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't think I'll eat here again. For a place that specializes in chicken and waffles, I'd think they would do a much better job. The fried chicken was not crispy or crunchy and the meat was dry. The waffles were soggy and not very good either. I ordered the fish and chips and that was disappointing as well. The breading and fish was flavorless and over cooked. I had high hopes for this place since it is always busy, but I was very unsatisfied with my meal. It wasn't worth the calories either."}
{"text":"lo los use to be my spot even left overs were fire! but the last few times it was not hitting the right buttons ever since they moved locations in tempe i assume...."}
{"text":"Meh' I think I went to the wrong location. The airport menu was scarce and they were sold out of everything by the time I got there.  I got a few pieces of chicken and a waffle, there truly isn't anything special about it. It surely isn't Roscoe's chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Moved to Phoenix from Georgia and this place is the closest I've gotten to good southern cooking. Collards were amazing and the candy sweets will make you think someone's grandma was in the back sprinkling love on them. Would highly recommend. Great service as well!"}
{"text":"This location wasn't that busy in the middle of the day and had a moderately diverse crowd which was nice to see. Seemed like there was a lot regulars there. 

I ordered a couple of drumsticks with mac and cheese and was able to try their eggs and waffles. My favorite was the mac and cheese. The chicken was just okay for me.

The people at the cash registers were really friendly and talked to us for a bit, so I thought that was pretty cool. I liked Lo-Lo's, I just wouldn't go out of my way to come back here - but if I was in the neighborhood I'd most likely stop by."}
{"text":"Lo-lo's is the best place I have gotten chicken and waffles from. That's hard to say considering I'm from the Los Angeles area and they are known for the iconic Roscos but after trying both I have to say Lo-lo's is better. I have been to their Phoenix, Scottsdale and Vegas locations and each time I have gone their chicken was always moist and the waffle never disappoints. Also, at every location they had some of the most friendly staff."}
{"text":"First time great-second time HORRIBLE service.  The manager had no clue.  Poor bartenders depending on kitchen and management is clueless.  Our orders were brought separately and the waffles were soggy and the chicken was raw.  I am not kidding you!  Seriously, and all they did for us was take 2 meals off the bill....I should have called the board of health on those guys.  Terrible!  Not even an apology.  The manager never came to even speak to us.  Where was the person that looks at the food before it comes out?  terrible let alone very unsafe."}
{"text":"Who knew that Chicken and Waffles would be so good together? Sure didn't, yet am so glad I tried it out. Wow that's good. Yeah it sounds odd, but the flavors are beautiful. Very pleased with this lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Some of the best chicken that melts in your mouth. Cornbread that tastes homemade, waffles that bring a tear to the eye and a masin jar of kool aid. Truly delicious food and great service"}
{"text":"Wasn't really what I expected, eating at Lo-Lo's. But, I should share that I am not a huge fan of fried chicken to begin with. That said, I can now cross \"Eat at Lo-Lo's\" off my \"things to do at least once\" list. 

Dottsy described the chicken perfectly. It was not greasy nor soggy. I did not find it especially flavorful but did pick up on the baking soda. 

I was expecting a much denser waffle but found it to be thin and limp. 

The mac and cheese was super creamy and had hints of cream of mushroom soup. 

Nothing was really memorable for me, except the collard greens. For some reason, that's the flavor that remains most vivid. They had a delicious healthy greens flavor with a nice chili flake kick. 

So, Lo-Lo's didn't knock my socks off but Lo-Lo's isn't really for me. It's for people who love fried chicken... so, if that's you, I suggest you not miss this place! You'll probably really like it!!"}
{"text":"So this location has many 4 and 5 star reviews and I am sure this location is usually worthy of those ratings. However, our visit was good but not the 5 star experience we had hoped for.

The decor and theme inside is catchy and looks like what you would expect a great chicken and waffle joint to look like. The mason jar glasses and chicken theme along with the specialty Kool-Aide flavors is neat. Everything was neat and clean inside and the staff was friendly and pleasant. 

Long Wait and Slow Service

The wait on Sunday was 45 minutes for a table for two which is not that uncommon for a great food place on the weekend. However, it's still a 45 minute wait once we were seated we then figured out why the wait was so long. It was not the busy number of customers its the EXTREMELY slow service.

We placed an appetizer order and that took about 35 minutes for the catfish beignets. When they did arrive they were tasty and we enjoyed them. We placed our order not long after the app order and that took about another 45 minutes after the app. So all in all about an hour for our food to be delivered. We noticed many of the other tables were taking 45 min to an hour as well for their food. 

When a kitchen is making food fresh I know it can take longer to get out to the customer and is well worth it usually. However, an hour to serve chicken and waffles even fresh is excessive. If the kitchen could expedite faster they could reduce the wait times and turn the tables more quickly improving the customer experience. 

Food

We both ordered chicken and waffle dishes I added on scrambled eggs and my wife selected grits. The chicken was tasty and juicy with a nice crispy skin. The waffle was regular waffles you would get in a hotel thin, bland, and not crispy. The eggs I ordered they messed up the order and needed to replace them. I was impressed how quickly they took care of it and remade the eggs. The grits were cooked perfect and my wife enjoyed them with the cheese and butter. 

Overall I can see the draw people have with the location. The owner has done a great job of branding the business, creating excitement inside with the decor, and his staff is friendly. The only downside is the long wait to get inside, long wait for the food, and mixed up order. The actual chicken and waffles were good and very similar to other places I have visited around the country. 

They are worth visiting and it is a good experience. If you visit on a non-weekend it might less of a wait as well. I hope you have the 5 star experience we hoped to have and others here on yelp have experienced."}
{"text":"I legitimately have not had such amazing waffles before. They are not super huge, thick and cake-y like some places that make waffles, which I like. The such a have a great cinnamon/vanilla flavor. The fried chicken has a great flavor. Have had lived in Louisiana for a while, I've missed some really great flavored fried chicken and Lolo's is amazing. The side of corn bread I got was really sweet and a huge portion for only $1 extra. The wait staff on the other had was sub par. It almost seemed like they were short handed. We didn't really have a consistent waitress/waiter which was annoying, just random people coming by bringing us stuff and refilling out drinks. All in all it was great food and worth the drive from Mesa."}
{"text":"Always awesome chicken and waffles. Possibly the best in the city but always the worst service. Always getting lip, long waits and eye rolls. Starting to think thats part of the ambience. Their just missing serving me on a pie dish plate and a couple curse word insults."}
{"text":"If i can write OMG and thats it i would. In PHX on business... Family local told me about this place and their southern cooking, when I got to town they made it a point to take me here... For lack of better words this place is pure awesome! My fam being from the south I know Soul Food an this right here is Super Soul Food turned up x3. I had Smothered Wings, Yams and Mac an cheese. All excellent!!!! My aunt had Fish an my sousin had Fried Chicken... All amazing and worth any penny. If this post doesnt make you check this place out when in Pheonix you don't know good eating period."}
{"text":"Awesome food just the wait for a table during the weekend or lunch time during the week is a little much."}
{"text":"Food was okay.  Ordered the Toy-Toy.  I've definitely had better.  The service was ridiculous.  Qwan did not seem like he wanted to be at work today and he specified that he does not eat at Lo-Lo's."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to order because everything looked delicious on the menu!!! I ended up getting #9 which was one drumstick, one thigh, and a waffle. The waffle was a pretty good size so I had leftovers which I was excited to eat later. The prices are fair (my #9 was only $7) and the service is friendly and efficient. The only critique I have is that I wish the waffle was a little fluffier. I am impartial to Roscoe's :x"}
{"text":"Ever since the remodel, there is hardly a wait except Sundays. Delicious juicy chicken, cheesy mac, and tea so sweet it'll give you diabetes! Yumm"}
{"text":"I've lived my life off of Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. I knew no one who can do it better. Well now the king has just lost its crown. In fact I can't even go back to Roscoe's now that my taste buds have touched that of Lolo's.

The service - Nice and fun people
The chicken - Bigger and juicier
The waffles - Bigger and tastier
The mac & cheese - tastier and cheesier
The \"stupid fries\" - Stupid Good and Roscoe's doesn't have it.
The Kool Aid in a jar - Roscoe's doesn't know the meaning of DRANK!!!

Cons - Closest one is in Arizona which would mean I would have to drive 6 hours to get there... but it is worth it!!!"}
{"text":"im not a hater in any way, shape, or form...

im just sayin, i kinda grew up with chicken and waffles since i was a kid...plenty of spots in Oakland for some quality chicken and waffles...

ive had much better elsewhere...

kinda reminded me of the hype of when i went to go have chicken and waffles at Roscoe's in L.A....after having it, i wasnt impressed either.

the chicken itself was cooked perfectly...the batter wasnt all that great...

crispy? yes.

needed more salt and other flavors...i mean, when you get chicken and waffles, its a play on sweet and savory, right?  flavors gotta be poppin off in your mouth, but the flavors just wasnt there for me...might have been an off day or something...

very friendly staff tho..."}
{"text":"They now have a new policy: they won't let you order takeout over the phone without giving them your credit card number. That's right: You have to tell them your credit card number, have them write it down in a busy kitchen with all sorts of pieces of paper flying around before they tack it up where anybody walking in off the street can read it plainly, and then PRAY that nothing happens to it.

This is ridiculous, especially if you were planning on paying in cash. It was explained as a \"Well, what happens if you order something then don't come in for it?\" situation. BS. If someone orders then doesn't pay, you simply don't accept orders from that phone number anymore, rather than treating EVERYONE like a potential criminal.

PS: Lest anyone thinks this is a \"New Customer Only\" thing, I'd ordered takeout twice from this same location using the same phone number, came in and paid for it, then went home without incident. But now I'm not to be trusted??? In that case, I can trust them to get along without my business."}
{"text":"Really good chicken and waffles, fast to go ordering, just hate that there is no to go parking, had to tip valet for a 2 second parking job. Not a good place to take friends and family on a Saturday or Sunday morning, insanely busy and they don't take reservations. Would like to go back and eat inside at a slower time during the week."}
{"text":"Well where do I start.....I didn't know what to really expect when I came to this establishment....but it compared very favorable to the world famous Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles in Los Angeles. We waited about 15 minutes to be seated because this locale is always crowded and there is always a wait. When we got seated we were immediately approached by a server to take our drink orders. I had the homemade lemonade which they call \"Dranks\" at this location....LOL....I loved that. The jars are huge that the drinks come in and while the refills are free....I didn't even need one.

I ordered a dish called the \"Betty Boop\" which is a juicy all white meat chicken breast....and perhaps the BEST WAFFLE I HAVE EVER HAD. Now there are a lot of great \"Soul Food\" items on the menu but the Fried Chicken and Waffles you must try without question. If it is not the BEST WAFFLE you have EVER put in your mouth please write me and let me know because I guarantee you will LOVE the waffles. 

The service was second to none....I mean every few minutes someone was checking on us....it was like having a maid....butler....and housekeeper while you just sat back and enjoyed your meal and the experience. One of the nice ladies there even lowered the blinds for us sitting in booths with our backs to the sunlight so we could cool off.....I mean wow....that was so nice of her. Now I don't about the location in Phoenix....but this one in Scottsdale is fantastic. The parking is a bear because it is located in a strip mall.....but all-in-all it is not to terrible. 

Like I said I am always skeptical about \"Southern Food\" that is not served in the south per say....but again this is MUST DO chicken....WAFFLES....and soul food dining at it's best. So if your ever near Old Town Scottsdale.....take a short drive over to N Scottsdale Rd and Thomas and pay a visit to LO-LO's. Remember while your there to Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles!! Very good fried chicken, moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside. Waffles look like they are from waffle house, tasty!"}
{"text":"When I first heard of this place I was like who would eat chicken with waffles. Well one day my son and I thought we would try it out. We got there and my son said \"I'm not to sure about this place dad\".
But OMG the food is fantastic. The fried chicken is the best Ive ever had. And the waffles are so good. The two of them together is fantastic. Their mac n cheese is very good.
And you can't truly experience LoLo's without some Kool-Aid. You don't order it by flavor buy by the color. My favorite is Red. 
This is one of our favorite places to eat. I was so happy to see that they opened up at Chase Field. We eat there every time we go to a D-Dacks game. I just wish the had Kool-Aid there. 
If you have never had LoLo's Chicken and Waffles I suggest you try it. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken and waffles!!!
In my opinion, one of the best fried chicken places anywhere in Phoenix.  Crispy crunchy outside with a juicy tender and succulent inside.  The seasoned coating is so flavorful and locks in all the juices making each and every bite just a little bit of heaven.  A definite must of my book"}
{"text":"This was my first time not having lolos in the airport, the food was amazing!!! But one thing, that place is so dusty its crazy! Heard at least 3 people sneeze! Every single light fixture and wall divider was covered in dust! Ew!"}
{"text":"We live within walking distance of this Lo-Lo's in Scottsdale and kept saying we need to go check it out.  

Finally!  And so glad we did.  We came in for a Saturday morning breakfast and immediately upon walking in we knew it was going to be good.  All the staff were very friendly and had smiles on their faces.  Our waiter Mike (tall, thin black guy) exuded such a genuine kindness and easy going attitude.  As someone who has worked in the restaurant industry, I know a really good server when I see one and Mike is one of them. 

Oh, and the food?  My wife had the biscuits and gravy - awesome gravy and excellent potatoes.  I had the Phat Boy and the grits with cheese add Lo-Lo's hot sauce, was great.  The bacon Bloody Mary definitely added to the overall positive experience. 

Go check it out!!!"}
{"text":"This place was worth the hype.  Excellent chicken and waffles.  Quick friendly staff.  My pink drank was always full and my server  Charrae asked several times if we were ok."}
{"text":"So I came to Phoenix 3 years ago for a business trip and had the chance to experience Lo-Lo's. I was so glad that my job was sending me back to Phoenix this month so I could once again experience this place! Imagine my surprise when I arrived in a taxi cab and the place was totally renovated! I mean it's larger, more modern looking and even has a patio. I was worried that the food might not be the same, but it was even better than I remembered. The menu is so extensive and everything looked and sounded good. I decided on 3 pieces of chicken, grits, scrambled eggs with cheese and onions and of course 2 waffles...oh and I had to add a salmon croquette. My coworkers got some of the same things along with fried catfish, mac and cheese and potato salad. We all enjoyed our food tremendously, but you know what else we loved?? The DRANKS! We started out with the Lemonade/Ice Tea mix, then moved on to the Blue Kool Aid and Lemonade mix. My coworker then got a Red, Grape Koolaid and Lemonade mix! Gosh how I love this place. Our server Carlos was awesome, so personable and stayed on top of everything we needed. The one last thing that made this place so awesome and made the dining experience one of the best was the music. Whatever Pandora station they have on rotation or whoever made their playlist is ON POINT! I was grooving the whole time I was eating, two my most favorite things in life, good food and good music.  Oh and how could I forget! I was too full, but best believe I took a piece of lemon cake home! Yessssssssssss Honey!!! Ate a little piece of it today, days later I might add and this is after I traveled back to the East Coast with it in my carry on (it's been in the fridge in between travelling time) and it definitely meets my expectations. Oh how I'll miss you Lo-Lo's I wish there was one in DC, until I see you again Phoenix!

Whether it had still been in that little shack of a restaurant or not, I will always come back to Lo-Lo's , but I'm so proud and happy for you in your new digs!!!"}
{"text":"This place was surprising. The food was ok at best. The chicken breast I received was well, well done. I usually eat the skin, but this was bitter and dry and crumbling. The darkest brown in the crayola box. I do not waste food, so even though the meat was dry, i still ate all the edible parts of the breast. The table next to us got a beautiful piece that was golden brown. When asked by the server how we were doing, i said sad. I explained how my chicken was, and showed her the plate of almost black chicken skin and pieces. She went to the back. The owners wife came to the table and with attitude asked  what my problem with the chicken was. I showed her, then pointed to the example of properly cooked chicken at the next table. She then said, well that is a thigh. It wasn't, but the cook is what we were discussing, over cooked is overcooked no matter if it is a breast, drum, or thighs. Then she commented on the fact that i consumed some of it and that it looked tastey to her. I never asked for another piece, was just giving honest feedback. I said \"Its fine, not a big deal\". I did not want to argue with someone about what properly cooked chicken looks like. Then she replied, \"Its not a big deal, why are you making it a big deal?\" Then she decided i was done with the rest of my plate and stomped away. The server brought a piece in a togo bag. Message received, PLEASE LEAVE!!! We declined the piece and promtly left. I have never had someone act this way at a restaurant and was shocked. We had learned that this is not the normal management, but the owners wife. Well its clear she did not have any hospitality training. Well, you have lost a customer for life over an apology, i was full and didn't even want another piece of chicken. I just wanted to let them know there was room for improvement. But a sorry about that, was clearly to much to ask for."}
{"text":"KILLER!

I had the Lolo platter of fried chicken and two waffles the morning after running the Arizona Half Marathon.  I earned the right to eat whatever I wanted, dammit!  The chicken was crispy and really tasty.  The waffles had something special going on, a little nutmeg maybe?  Together with maple syrup...ah, a symphony!

And with the well mannered hoodlum working like a dog serving everyone in the place, and the listening to the cook yelling from the kitchen, this was totally fun.  Lolo's is on my Scottsdale rotation!

Don't miss this place, real good food and local color."}
{"text":"Treated rudely by the manager?!?! Despite the seemingly hip menu and twist on traditional black dishes, this restaurant has no interest or savvy in dealing with POC from the management level. I came in from California with my parents and we stopped because they had heard good reviews. I was fighting a cough and purchased some tea at the airport to soothe my throat. When we arrived here, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable, with our hostess Victoria seating is with personalised suggestions and our server Sir adeptly explaining the menu and clarifying Abby questions. After being seated and ordering drinks, the manage AJ comes and stands over me at the table. He explains that there is no outside food or drinks. I acknowledge and return scanning my menu. After hovering over my shoulder he then states that he is going to take drink. I stated I understand the policy and ask if he can either expedite my drink or provide a glass for me to finish while I waited. He ignores my request and states either take the drink back to my car or he will take it. He then proceeds to stand menacingly over me, refusing to allow me to finish making my menu selection and restates he is going to take my drink, finally grabbing it off the table and tossing it out. Afterwords he does nothing to check on or expedite the drink I ordered and avoids the dining area. Working in food service for several years I was shocked by the openly combative nature of the exchange, the only solution was HIS solution. I thought the customer was always right, it looks like at the Phoenix Lo-Lo's, AJ is always right. Shout out to the excellent servers, but I absolutely cannot recommend this as a safe space to dine for POC while AJ is around."}
{"text":"First time here. Excellent attentive service, huge portions, and awesome tasting food. Can't wait to come back again!!!"}
{"text":"Love the Kool-Aid and Shrimp and Grits! Place is always clean and very taken well taken care of."}
{"text":"The only bad thing about this place is that I can't afford to go every single day! EVERYTHING on their menu is soooooo good!  Was so good we went back 2 nights in a row. I tried my first fried pickles here and must say at first I was kind of like I don't know about this but as soon as I tried one I was like, best idea ever to order this item."}
{"text":"Do not go there if you have a late afternoon client meeting.  You will be happy, but you will be oh so sleepy.  What I love about LoLo's is that they have the best lunch combinations already figured out for you....the hard part is just picking out which one.  The macaroni and cheese is just the type you want, gooey and cheesy.  The collard greens are tender with just a little bitterness and the chicken is without compare.  I care mostly about the waffles which are huge and the size of a dinner plate.  Oh and you can get red kool-aide in mason jars.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"I will NEVER go AGAIN. I went with a LARGE crew intown for bike week. I first brought them to this place a few yrs ago, before they rebuilt the new place downtown. The owner was nice and humble. Appreciated all 30 PLUS people that came in. Each yr they now come into town they ALL stop in and eat. 

This yr, they rebuilt and EVERY single staff member acted too good or busy.. including the owner. I ordered a SALAD . HOW HARD IS A SALAD WITH CHICKEN. NEVER CAME the owner was very rude and did not care. I will never go again. 

One thing people shouldn't do is forget who you are, WHERE you came from and WHO got you there. Black people ( sorry not about race..BUT) Black people have been supporting LoLos and religiously going from jump. All the sudden you get alil change in pocket...and change ?  You are never too far up... to fall down !

#FAIL. 

p.s. This review is late, and only now thought to do it, as I wanted some lolos today...and recalled the rudeness and said..no go."}
{"text":"On my quest to visit all the yelp high star places in my hood I stopped by LoLo's today.  I would have never known this place exsisted if it wasn't for yelp.  I had the Betty Boop which is 1 breast and 1 waffle.  The hubs had Sheedah's Special - a breast a wing and a waffle. 

Since I've never had chicken AND waffles before I had no basis for comparison.  The chicken was a little on the dry side but I really liked the flavor.  The first bites of the waffle kinda reminded me of a frozen waffle but I quickly got past that with the cinnamon, buttery flavors. The iced tea was super good and I love that they serve them in Kerr jars so we didn't require any refills.  Oh!  I almost forgot the grits... because they're forgettable.  I've lived in the south and grits never grew on me.  It's been so long since I tried them and the reviews were stellar; I thought I'd give them a second chance.  I'm sorry grits but if that much butter and cheese can't make you taste good, nothing can.

The service was excellent.  Very quick.  Everyone was pleasant except for the hostess.  When we told the server it was our first time there she gave us a free piece of red velvet cake.  Very moist with a cream cheese frosting and walnuts on top."}
{"text":"I really had high hopes for this place as I have heard lots of great things but I was really disappointed. The hostess had such an attitude and chip on her shoulder. She didn't crack a smile, and hardly spoke to us. First impression fail here! Our server was friendly and seemed knowledgeable. We had a large party and he kept on top of things and overall did a great job. 

Now some things that bothered me... the hair in the salt in the salt shaker was disgusting! I should have complained but just let it slide. The music was so loud and awful! It was religious gospel sounding music and everyone in our party agreed it was horrible, way to loud and unnecessary. It literally drove us out of the restaurant, most of our party just got up and walked out leaving a few of us to finish. Driving guests out, based on your music, doesn't seem like a smart way to run a business if you ask me. 

On to the food... the sweet tea was so amazing! Kool Aid on tap was a nice treat for the kiddos too! The food was really tasty! Everyone was really pleased with his/her food at our table. The biscuits and gravy were killer and massive! Only problem was there was enough gravy on the plate for the two massive biscuits, everyone at our table that ordered it had to ask for more gravy. The waffles were delicious as was the fried chicken. 

I honestly do not know if we would return but if we do we hope the hostesses are friendlier, the music is low and the salt/pepper shakers are free of hairs."}
{"text":"lo lo's has what you need if you're looking for soul food where there is a lack of soul... the chicken is good and the sides are killer - collard greens, candied yams - even the cornbread is on point. they got pepper sauce too. only thing missing is some Crystal hot sauce, which i will from here on bring myself. i'll be back for that waffle.

regarding what i just saw on urbanspoon - saying that lo lo's was a good \"cheap eat\" - i HIGHLY disagree. although the food is good and unique to the area (which is frankly why i don't mind paying for it), they're VERY proud of what they serve. this is no knock on lo lo's - as they should be proud of what they serve - but lots of soul food is inexpensive to prepare, but this soul food IS going to cost you. so don't be surprised when they bring the check."}
{"text":"If there was a way to give this no stars they would get it. A BIG FAT ZERO FOR YOU. This is only for the Central Ave. location. 

After hearing all the rave about Chicken and Waffles I was very excited to try this with my family. We had never been to or tried LoLos. We were so excited to try it. Today was the day. Saturday August 20, 2016. We walked in the front door to the front desk. The girl standing there saw us walk in and disappeared. She just left and we were standing there. 

We stood there for about 8 mins. And numerous staff saw us. There were a few older people standing talking to others in the restaurant. Two younger black men walked in behind us and we're just chatting while we were standing there. Again no one acknowledged us....6 min. We stood there another 2 minutes. 8 mins we finally turned around and left. 

Antwayn Jones and Berlan who were the Manager and General Manager, you should all be ashamed of yourselves to allow your staff member to treat paying customers this way. I certainly don't want to bring race into this but we can't help but wonder if this was because of all the racial tension. Needless to say, whatever reason it was you lost 5 customers and don't worry. We will tell our friends and family about this visit and they will tell two friends and so on. 

Love, 
Karma"}
{"text":"Alright, I have been away from Yelp for quite some time, and I feel that this place is fitting to be my comeback review...

Chicken and Waffles.  Yes, chicken and M'Fin waffles.  

In the ghetto?  Check
Has sweet tea?  Check
Has no-nonsense, quick service?  Check
Ridiculously long wait?  Check
Best thing that I have eaten in the last year?  Check

I have to say, not the best fried chicken I have ever had, but pretty damn good- it could use more seasoning.  Now the waffles, probably the best ever...  The waffles are deliciously soft inside, a little crispy out with a wonderful cinammoness to them.  The seating is cramped, but it doesn't matter as soon as your food is delivered your table goes quiet, you get tunnel vision and after the first bite you are taken away to an orgy of goodness.

If you are in Phoenix, this is a requirement.  Come real early or be prepared to wait.  Don't forget to order the Red Velvet cake and they have Kool-Aid if that fits your fancy.  Even after I came home from Arizona, I couldn't stop talking about LoLo's for like 2 weeks.  Shoot, two months later and I am still drooling thinking about it..."}
{"text":"Bang for your buck? Heck ya! 3 generous pieces of chicken, waffles, two eggs and grits for 15 bucks. Service? It was great. No complaints! Flavor? It was lacking. For a place that prides itself on chicken and waffles I would have expected more flavor in the chicken. The waffles were great though. Something else that I didn't appreciate was a big *** bug I noticed in my tea as I was finishing it. I  guess taking the tea off the bill was a nice gesture but it completely ruined my meal."}
{"text":"Good stuff, plenty to eat, attractive setting, all at a reasonable price.  I'm a healthy hardy eater.  Most restaurants fall short when it comes to my appetite causing me to reach for more money; Not Lo Los.  I... am... stuffed after eating at Lo Los."}
{"text":"Never disappointed when we come to Phoenix to pick up our cars we purchase around the corner. Makes the 5 hour Drive worth it! Can't beat the prices either. Very affordable."}
{"text":"Popular, friendly, and clean chicken and waffles spot that's worth the wait.4.4 stars

- Chicken: crispy and well seasoned but not too greasy, tender meat inside
- Cornbread: sweet moist mongo muffin with crispy edges
- Waffles: like that you can get them cooked with pecans in the batter though wish they'd make em a bit crispier
- Fried okra: I always order this when I see it
- Fun drinks: 4 different flavors/colors if kool aid and super crazy the way the southerners like it sweet tea
- Atmosphere: dinery slick red booths
- Service: very friendly and food came out quick

Midlights:
- Mac and cheese: I didn't care for the sour creamy taste of this particular version, but my cousin loved it
- Red Velvet cake: we're a fan of this type of cake, but this rendition was just ok. Moist soft cake was great, but the flavor was lacking 

Lowlights
- Long wait: even Sunday at 2:30 there was an hour wait
- Ran out of banana pudding: the southern hub's favorite dessert he was looking forward to ever since he saw the commercial. Sad he was so disappointed
- Closes at 4 so don't plan on dinner. Sad seeing people come in and be turned away...

I'm not a fried chicken connoisseur like my hub but I think I like this even better than traditional Roscoes and wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars but rounding up to 4 since the staff working there was super nice, and the fried chicken was really good. However, lesson learned- chicken and waffles is much better when dining in versus taking out and trying to eat it in a car! Since we were late to the Giants' Spring Training game, we picked up food to go from Lo-Lo's and planned to eat it at the stadium. Due to the rain, we ended up having to eat in the car instead, which was quite the production. We ordered:

-KK's (3 Pieces Chicken Southern Style, 2 Waffles, Grits, 2 Eggs w/Cheese & Onions, $15, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lo-los-chicken-and-waffles-scottsdale?select=6an0x7V3j6mDDkRivb4f7Q#6an0x7V3j6mDDkRivb4f7Q): Mixed review on this plate- the fried chicken was awesome, with crispy skin and juicy interior. However, the waffles left something to be desired- the edges were dry, and they were very bland. The eggs w/cheese and onions were delicious, but the grits were clumpy and tasteless. I would recommend ordering the fried chicken and eggs a la carte.
-Slice of Sandy Sand's Red Velvet Cake ($5, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lo-los-chicken-and-waffles-scottsdale?select=6an0x7V3j6mDDkRivb4f7Q#cspooCDNtgXVvESuImQTSA): Ok, but not amazing. I usually am not a fan of red velvet cake, but really wanted to try this version based on all the amazing reviews. The cake was fairly dense, but still had some fluffiness/lightness to it. The cream cheese frosting was on the sweet side, but they didn't overfrost, so it was actually the perfect amount for all the cake.

Overall, I think Roscoe's wins the battle against Lo-Lo's, but the fried chicken here is still worth checking out. I still haven't found the perfect chicken and waffles place with amazing chicken AND waffles, but hopefully this will happen one day! However, the staff here is what really made a different for me- they were all smiles and EVERYONE greeted you or thanked you for coming in. This is a lot different than the experience at Roscoe's! In any case, make sure you come early if you're dining in, since there was still a wait at 1:30pm on a Friday. The parking lot for this Lo-Lo's was busy since they have a lot of other shops at this strip mall, but we were able to find a spot pretty quickly."}
{"text":"I'm from the south so everything on their menu is on point. And the sweet tea is literally the definition of Southern Sweet tea. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"My first time here and let's just say they don't understand customer service. Please be aware that when WE come here as customers we are the ones that are keeping money in your pocket and keeping your business running. Without customers then you ain't got nothing. Might want to take some classes on how to treat paying customers. And I haven't even sat down yet or tried the food."}
{"text":"Not what I expected,  chicken was dry and tasteless the coating was excellent, I wish it had been marinated to give it some flavor, the waffles looked like my grandkids had made them it was just sloppy.  The flavor I did not care for at all just too much flavoring took away the waffle experience needless to say I took it home for my dogs.  Btw seeing the waitress scratching her ass did not help my appetite loved the coffee"}
{"text":"This restaurant is worth visiting, very good chicken and waffles but I had better.  Shrimp n grits subpar too me and very busy.  The mac n cheese gets 5 stars.  Service was great and Monique our server we could have taken her home with us.  She made the visit a Delight.  The catfish beignets I laugh at the name because of the New Orleans reference is just catfish strips but they were darn good.  Drinks are pretty nice, served in mason jars. I think because we came right before closing that the food was missing something or rushed and wasn't better than our first visit but I'll come back"}
{"text":"So Lo-Los used to be one of our favorite go to places, but since our visit today I'm not too impressed with the quality of the food.We ordered a Lil Amadi and I was not impressed with the quality and taste of the chicken, for me it tasted as if they were getting their meat from a low quality place. The waffle itself was good, but the taste of the chicken was not made to perfection. Usually I get a chicken breast but this time I got the thigh, so perhaps that contributed to the low satisfaction of its taste. Additionally, our waitress was quite rude and walked off as we were finishing our sentence, so overall we were not very impressed."}

Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles has been around the Phoenix are for quite some times and has been a local favorite for many reasons.  Chicken and waffles? Yes, indeed it is a deadly combination!  If you ever need to carbo load I tell ya this is your place.  

I generally can't eat a lot so I opt out on the sha-bang of 3 pieces of chicken, 2 waffles, grits, 2 eggs, and cheese.  Yeah tell me about it!  That's a lot of food!  Yummy though!  I go for the Shee-dah's Special; 1 breast, wing, and waffle.  Overall, I love it!  Nice succulent chicken and syrup induced waffles!  By god, what have you done to us!  I can't complain about obesity problems in America especially when you come to Lo-Lo's; instead embrace it haha!  I did indeed tried the Kool-Aid on tap.  Personally, I don't think I can handle so much sugar in a beverage!  Once you take a swig; you're thirsty for water!

In the end, Lo-Lo's deliver what they say; Chicken & Waffles.  Service is real attentive and overall the food is a must try if you never had chicken & waffles! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So I've been to Lo-Lo's several times and it has never disappointed! The foos is always well seasoned and tasty. Ive never had a bad server, the lo-lo's punch is great. 

My husband loves it here and for me, I like it as a once and a while type of deal. There is usually a wait,  but yelp does have an awesome feature which allows you to put your name on the waitlist! 

It's a little loud and crowded sometimes and that's ok sometimes; the service and food is good. The price point is fair for the portion sizes of the food. Give it a try I promise you'll leave in a food coma!"}
{"text":"What a great place to discover the chicken and waffles dish. The Mac & Cheese is also excellent and so is the service.

For those rare occasions when I crave fried chicken, I'll go to Lo-Lo's to satisfy it."}
{"text":"First place I wanted to try on my visit to Phoenix after reading rave reviews. Had to wait no more then 10 mins to be seated on a Tuesday around 11. Servers were friendly and always on top. Ordered the smothered chicken and waffles. Chicken was delicious and flavorful and the waffles were so soft and tasty! My husband got the biscuits and said it was the best he ever had, as they do make them fresh! Collard greens were tasty and the fried green tomatoes weren't bad! Loved the batter. Pass up on the Mac and cheese and mojito, but def try the kool-aid. This place is worth the hype!"}
{"text":"So sad that our experience at Lo-Lo's didn't live up to expectations. I picked up Jenny from the airport and, after a brief discussion about the local restaurants Sky Harbor was incorporating into their terminal renovations, we decided it was the perfect opportunity to give Lo-Lo's a try. We have another soul food restaurant near us (Off Da Hook) but Lo Lo's is like 'the' soul food in the valley so we had to give it a run. 

Our server, though a bit slow with service, was extremely friendly and really the highlight of the visit (next to the Kool Aid -- oh yeah!) but neither the food nor the prices knocked our socks off. It was all good but nothing to write home about. Maybe I need to try more than just the chicken, waffles, and mac n cheese next time."}
{"text":"My daughter was hired by this company,everything went well for orientation and two weeks of training. Than they fired her,over a month ago,she has not received her wages. She has been down there three times,and they keep sweeping it under the rug! They ignore her call's,they treat their employee's horribly,a couple of her friends had same experience,I feel horrible for her,and want everyone to know they are a very low class joint! We are putting a complaint in with the industrial commission of az. Please do not eat at this restraunt,they don't deserve the business!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed eating here.  Finally made the drive across the Valley for a weekday lunch.  There was no wait.  The hostess and servers were all very friendly.  Food was really good.

I ordered the chicken fried chicken platter with collard greens, smothered potatoes, and a gigantic corn muffin.  On top of that I added a biscuit, piece of fried catfish, and a chicken wing.  It was overkill, but I wanted to try a little of everything and wasn't sure I'd ever make it back over here.  The CFC was a gigantic breast filet, perfectly juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside, and delicious.  Seriously big...about an inch thick and could feed three people!!  I could not believe how juicy that meat was!  It came smothered in sausage gravy. (see photo)  Gravy was good, but next time I'd ask for it on the side.  Greens were good.  Potatoes just okay.  Corn muffin was wonderful, a little sweet, just the way I prefer my corn bread.  Catfish had a nice flavor and perfect coating.  Honestly, the best thing I had was that fried chicken wing...crispy, juicy, flavorful, and makes you wish you'd ordered more of it.  My sister got the Lo-lo's meal, three pieces of fried chicken and 2 waffles.  She added a side of mac and cheese.  She thought all was great except for the breast piece, which she found a tad dry and bland.  Her fave was the mac and cheese. 

Oh, and they had sweet tea on the menu...always a plus in my book!

Bottom line:  Good service.  Good food.  Don't go if you're looking to eat light.  Add on a chicken wing!  Or two.  Be prepared to nap afterwards."}
{"text":"Delicious food, GREAT service (there were 12 of us and the one waitress was charismatic and on top of everything!), and awesome atmosphere. Definitely a hit and one of Phoenix's best spots!! Thanks Lo-Lo!

PS- If you're going as a big group, bring cash!"}
{"text":"So this review is solely for he Scottsdale location. I've also dined at the downtown location which I would rate closer to a 4-4.5. And very comparable to Roscoes in So-Cal. That said, was disappointed in the bland taste of the fried chicken. It was also over cooked closer to a brown than a golden color, which comes out on the taste. That said, the waffle was on point and so were their rice and beans. And of course you can never go wrong wrong with Kool-Aid!!!! I'd definitely go back to LoLo's, but I definitely would stick to the downtown location as opposed the he Scottsdale. If you know Roscoes well, its the difference between eating Roscoes on Pico or Long Beach and eating it in Anaheim with all the hipsters."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to treat family and friends to. The central location is the best place ever! The food is amazing!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Going to Lolo's is always a delicious treat for me. You can't eat fried chicken and waffles everyday, after all. 

Lolo's recently relocated slightly north on Scottsdale, to a much larger and nicer space. Now an independent building, the new Lolo's features a hip indoor/outdoor bar. Although the old location served alcohol, now it feels like an attractive destination for a drink. I plan on coming here just for drinks in the future. 

I ate dinner at Lolo's shortly after the move and am very pleased with the experience. Everything we ordered was amazing as expected. The portions were huge! Our waitress was sweet and prompt with our food and drinks. 

Tip: order the chicken and waffles. If you're feeling especially malnourished, add a side of mac and cheese. No matter what you order, I promise you won't leave hungry! But most importantly, don't forget the koolaid!!!!"}

{"text":"I haven't had real chicken and waffles, since the big A in Oakland california. LO-LOs chicken and waffles is AMAZING!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT TO ANYONE! If it doesn't seem like something you'd like, come anyways!! Great staff better food, and an amazing atmosphere! Very welcoming and delicious!"}
{"text":"The chicken & waffles are great.  The waffles have a great flavor & the chicken is seasoned well & was served piping hot.  Our waiter's name was Sir & he was attentive, personable & a pleasure to interact with.  I've been to Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles & Gladys Knights Chicken & Waffles, Lolo's is the best hands down."}
{"text":"This meets my chicken and waffles expectation.  Large portions. Tasty corn fritter appetizer. Reasonably priced dishes and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Today my server was Annette and although it may not be entirely her fault our experience was horrible. First we waited to be seated, which isn't abnormal. What is abnormal is the amount of time it took for us to have our drink order taken. When it was taken the wrong drinks came out. We waited a full 40 mins for food and when that came out even that was incomplete. It took a full 55 mins to get our order in its entirety. I know Sunday's are probably busy days but let me suggest having a full staff to cover the rush. Like I said the fault is not just on Annette but the whole establishment. I felt as if the whole staff was unprepared and confused."}
{"text":"Lolos isn't what it once was. The quality of the food has gone down tremendously. The portions are smaller and the prices are still high. I don't mind paying higher prices for good quality sized portions. But this place is slowly getting worse. I ordered some stupid fries with a side of corn bread as well as some Mac n cheese and was beyond disappointed!  1 star."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate with the family and I was very anxious to go. I've been to a couple other Lo-Lo's but this was my first time going to the one in Scottsdale. Our server was Alexis and I can't remember the other girls name (Megan?). I ordered the fried chicken sandwich because in the menu it had said something about it winning \"Arizona's Best\" vote or something to that effect. Normally I would go for the fried chicken and waffles or their Honey Hot wings which are killer but I was feeling lucky. I believe I heard a live DJ too but I didn't go look.

Unfortunately, our server was rude and unattentive. I never received a refill on my water and the chicken sandwich was bone dry. I asked for some sauce for my \"Arizona's Best\" sandwich and was told \"It has it on there\" by my waitress. 

Another thing that bothered me was the parking. The majority of their parking lot is reserved for the hotel next door believe it or not. I don't know how much control the restaurant has over that but I found it ridiculous to park across the street and walk to the entrance. The food is normally delicious but I feel I had a bad night, and the service made it worse. I won't be back to this location but I'll go to another one someday. Maybe I'll see Donovan McNabb at the Gilbert location again!"}
{"text":"Still good eats to be had here!!!!"}
{"text":"Great Food parking sucks but in that area they do the best they can.
Waffle and Chicken cool!!!!"}
{"text":"Just not blown away. The chicken was great but everything else was just average in my book (waffle, candies yams,  cornbread, etc). The service was average at best and the place was just packed and slow to move. To top it off, the prices here are darn high. Overall, just missed the mark with me."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and the food.  We had the fried green beans for an appetizer and then I ordered pecan waffles with fried chicken!  I enjoyed every bite!  The sweet tea was almost like a syrup.  I had to ask for a glass of water to water down the sweet tea.  Next time I might order a kook aid"}
{"text":"chicken and waffles is truly a stellar combo. i was introduced to it back in college at LA's famous Roscoes.... while it is a good combo, most joints commit the sin of sub-par chicken with an eggo style waffle. so, i'm always a wee bit hesitant to go for it. HOWEVER, at this visit at Lo-Lo's I decided to go for it. I had the combo with 2 thighs and a waffle. And a lemonade. 

The good? the chicken was actually really good and not some starved anorexic chicken thigh. the waffle was pretty tasty. all in all a good combo of quality ingredients. the price ($7) was also pretty good.

the bad? the lemonade ($3 for a huuuuge mason jar... and free refills i believe). it was SOOOO sweet, i felt my teeth rotting. 

it's cute, it's kitschy, the price is pretty good. it didn't have me raving like a mad woman about how amazing it was, but it was decent. if i had to choose a chicken and waffle place, i would choose Lo-Lo's over Roscoes. yup."}
{"text":"Delicious! My hubby and son got chicken and waffles and I had the chicken tender on a biscuit. Everything was excellent! Also they have Kool Aid on tap and the alcoholic drinks were very yummy. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm in LOVE with their waffle.  EVERYTHING about it, I LOVE!  It's got this, cinnamon streusel, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Mini Eggo Cinnamon Toast taste to it...AND it's a thick waffle too, the consistency is on point.  Now let's talk about this chicken though.  SO juicy.  Cooked PERFECTLY.  Seasoned to the T!  And when it comes out to your plate, it comes out piping HOT and FRESH.  Caution: you get A LOT of food!  Your plate is literally covered.  Which I had NO problem with it.  The sides, I was so torn as to what to get, but I ended up with the collard greens and the mac & cheese.  The collard greens were good, but not seasoned enough to me liking.  I had to add a little salt, some hot sauce, that helped, but I mean, I've had better from my mom and grandmother.  The mac & cheese was good, a little on the dry side, but good cheesy/buttery flavor nonetheless.  I DO know one thing.  When I go back to Phoenix, I plan on getting the Shrimp & Grits and their Fried Green Tomatoes.  They passed by my table too many times on a tray and they look AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I have been looking and looking for a better place for breakfast and I always end up comparing places to Lo Lo's.  It is simply the best place for breakfast in Phoenix...period.  I cannot speak on other locations but this is my favorite place to eat.  When family visits, I go here and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Tried coming here on a Saturday afternoon and there was a lineup. No line but still busy on a Monday afternoon! The catfish and fried green tomato apps were delicious, especially in the accompanying sauce. But you come here for the chicken and waffles. The #3 is the house speciality.

The waffles are like none I've ever tasted. Delicious, cinnamon bread-like and definitely plentiful. This along with 3 pieces of chicken. The chicken was fresh and crispy. Flavorful without being overly salty. Definitely homemade but not quite as down-home feeling as a couple of other nearby places we tried as well.

Definitely glad we came and would recommend trying it out without reservation."}
{"text":"I've got to admit, their fried chicken is pretty tasty. And combined with pure sugar aka the maple syrup with the waffles, you got yourself some good food. Is it healthy? Ohhhhh HELLLL NO. But delicious? Yes. They have different dishes but you basically get the same thing whatever you order... a piece or two of chicken and a type of waffles. A little expensive for some basic things but hey! If you like chicken and waffles, this is a good place to get it. It's kind of a salty and sweet thing. Good contrast!"}
{"text":"I've done a lot of chicken and waffles around this grand country, from roscoes in CA to Gladys Knights in GA. Lo-Lo's is right up there. Chicken is indeed very southern. And absolutely moist and delish! Waffles did not disappoint. Staff was super friendly. Couldn't have asked for a better experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! I ordered #3 with a side of mac & cheese. Every thing was on point, down to the butter. The chicken was moist, skin crispy, and seasoning was perfection. Definitely worth the 1 hour wait. Kisses to the chef!"}
{"text":"Lawd have mercy!  Just might have died and gone to soul food heaven!  Now I know what you might be thinking, what does this boy from upstate NY know about soul food?  Well I've traveled all over and eaten a lot of different places and my wife is southern born and raised.  

The building is a combo of hipster meets southern.  They have nice outdoor seating and the decor was great.  Loved the music they played (uncensored) had that IDGAF vibe.  

Down to the nitty gritty......the food!  First off we were told upon walking in that their chicken delivery truck was in a wreck and they were running dangerously low on all chicken but wings.  It was great for them to let us know off the bat but sad to think of all that could have been with that chicken.  We tried a couple drinks and had the two two (two waffles and two chicken wings) and the D man (waffle and fried catfish).  Everything was superb.  Waffles were done great, the syrup they use was excellent and the chicken, although small, was finger licking!  The drinks were made fast and fresh and came out in ball jars.  

If you're in Phoenix and anywhere near one of these restaurants go.  Just go.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Next time I'm in Phoenix this is my first stop! I ordered the Lo Los with a side of green beans and corn bread. WOW, I love that southern cooking! The sweet tea was amazing and at how many places can you order Kool-Aid on tap!"}
{"text":"Shrimp and grits, Chicken and waffles,  Chicken gizzards,  you name it!!! The atmosphere was off the chain..  Great place to visit if in Phoenix Arizona... A must return spot. Faith was the best hostess,  serving 25 of us and getting food out... fun and good food"}
{"text":"That was the worst experience I've  had in recent memory. 
NEVER GO TO LOLO'S ON SUNDAY unless you need the blood of jesus thrown in your face and screamed thru the speakers hovering over your table on volume 11 cuz they will not move you or turn it down. It was SOOOOO LOUD! Beyond loud....it was laughable if i wasnt having a rage stroke.
Absolute nonsense and definitely not necessary. I get it....its Sunday, jesus blah blah .....but really?? 

Our server spilled water all over the table and seemed irritated that i asked for napkins. We had to wait over a half hour for our fried green tomatoe appetizer which ended up coming out with our food  and the basket comes with only 4 slices so i guess those tomatoes are well over $1 a slice cuz i think they're like $7 bucks. Puhleeze. Never again. 

I ordered the chili cheese fries and they serve it in a plastic basket with a paper liner. After three bites the paper is shredding apart and mixing with the chili. GIMME A FREAKING BREAK! 

Ur killing me Lolo......."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here before a Suns game and waited 45 minutes to get in.  I knew this place was going to be good because all the famous sports players like Amare love to go there.  After the wait, we were allowed inside and we were starving.  We were instantly greeted by the owner/manager Larry White and he wasted no time getting us some sweet tea and Kool-Aide (I wish every place served Kool-Aide).  We both got the Lo Lo's plate which consisted of 3 pieces of chicken and 2 large waffles.  The food came out quickly and we didn't waste anytime chowing it down. The chicken was fantastically seasoned and breaded and the waffles were outstanding.  We were very satisfied with our meal and preceeded to the Suns game. Although the Suns lost by 30 points to the Pistons, the trip from Tucson was well worth it because of Lo Lo's."}
{"text":"Our FIRST visit for lunch.  Had a WONDERFUL time.  Greeted at the front door by the manager.  When we sat down, AJ, our server, energetically pointed out all the fantastic food on the menu.  I got the veggie plate with Smothered potatoes, Spicy green beans, fried okra, and mac and cheese.  Was so much, had to take most of it home.  Cornbread was huge with a mound of butter on the top.

My lunch partners got the fried chicken salad which was great with candied walnuts and avocado.  Another got the Chicken Tender basket.

The food was incredibly hot, fresh, and delicious.  Service was prompt, friendly, and highly attendant.  

These folks KNOW how to do it right.  A friendly and welcoming environment.  We will bring our friends and come back soon."}
{"text":"Horrible I was double charged and when I called the next day I was told by the manager that they were \"busy\" and they would call me the next day to help me? Really that is not great customer service at all id i charge someone $120 I would think you would want to take care of them immediately. There food was fantastic but there customer service was horrible. Beware people they may overcharge you and say they will call you back at a later time to return your money never again!"}
{"text":"Great service and even better food! The breading on the chicken is to die for and the waffles are delicious!"}
{"text":"Coming from San Diego, we don't really have many great fried chicken spots. So it was very nice to stop into Lolos and see what Phoenix offered.

I was recommended the Stupid Fries by the waitress and decided to order two drumsticks along with it. I should have just stuck with getting more tradition fried chicken as the Stupid Fries weren't that special, nor was it amazingly delicious. The gravy or something in it was pretty salty. 

The fried chicken was great though! Crispy with great flavor. No awkward oil taste. Cooked perfectly moist. 

I was told that this is the best spot in Phoenix for fried chicken. I totally believe it and would love to see one pop up on San Diego! Make it happen!"}
{"text":"To put things in perspective we just finished playing 9 holes of golf nearby which took less time than it took to eat once we were seated. We arrived at 11am on a Monday and were seated very quickly, then it all went downhill from there. We weren't even greated by anyone for 15-20 minutes before we flagged somebody down who went to find us a server. Yes, 20 minutes just to order our drinks and we threw our food order in as well as we had known for a while what we wanted. During this time I couldn't help notice that every table on either side of us had a different server which seemed to indicate they didn't have an area just specific table assigned at random with nobody really sure who was covering what. Everbody around us (estimate 5 other tables) were equally complaining about the service and another table had to chase down someone to find there server after sitting for about 15 minutes as well. You had to even chase them down to pay your bill. This place didn't seem to understand customer service, througput of getting people in and out to churn more sales and there was no resemblance of management anywhere. Pretty much a free for all. I've had better service in Europe and that's not saying much. 1 hour and 30 minutes from the time we sat down until we were walking out. 

After sticking it out on the service side to see what the hype was all about I convinced myself I would separate my thoughts between the service and the product. I ordered the LoLo's Chicken and Waffles after all that's what is listed on the sign outside. It did fill me up, but not wanting more. The waffles were extremely dry and tasted like they just came out of the box. No flavor or life to them at all. The chicken was warm and edible but very dry and without any seasoning. Both items had about as much flavor and life to them as you might find served at a senior care home.

To sum it up the service and quality missed the mark big time, won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been dying to try a authentic chicken and waffle establishment for a long time. I needed some breakfast after climbing Camelback this morning so I decided to stop by Lo-Lo's.

What I didn't know is that they have around 5 restaurants throughout the Phoenix Metro area to include Scottsdale. I could have saved myself a few minutes of driving had I known that. None the less I made it here and the menu was so extensive! No matter what they put on there the only thing I knew I wanted was some chicken and some waffles! Some shrimp and grits caught my eye so I end up ordering those as well.

The waffles were Bar None the bomb.com! They had a hint of brown sugar in the batter and they were melt-in-your-mouth magnificent! The chicken however was pretty good it wasn't the best I've ever had but it compliment in the waffle superbly!

The shrimp and grits were a masterpiece to the naked eye. I would say the highlight of the shrimp and grits were the shrimp, they were battered and seasoned to perfection as well as plump and juicy! The Grits however, left me wanting more. I grew up eating grits so I know what grits taste like. The bacon bits kind of help save the grits overall it was still a tasty dish!

grades:
waffles- 9.5
chicken-8.25
shrimp- 9.0
grits- 7.5"}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's is easily my favorite restaurant in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area. Their menu is extensive and their new location is fantastic! Then now have a full bar with an outdoor patio. It's like they hired Marcus Lemonis from The Profit to revamp their location and menu!

I am a huge supporter of Rocscos Chicken and Waffles in Los Angeles and Lo-Los is easily becoming a close contender if not surpassing Roscos.

Try out their new location and bring your friends to hang out on their new patio!"}
{"text":"If you are in search of good ole down home soul food Lolo's will be a disappointment to you.  I ordered the gizzard, rice, & gravy. The brown gravy had absolutely NO flavor to it. I never salt my food but I had to add salt & pepper to the brown gravy. Still, it was no help. The bland coating to the gizzards was not crispy. My boyfriend ordered the Baby Ray. He, too, said his brown gravy had no taste. His waffles had an unexpected cinnamon spice to them (which was not described on the menu). Coming from Georgia, my palate was very spoiled by all the southern cook'n restaurants I had to choose from. To me I cannot classify Lolo's as a soul food restaurant. It is a poor imitation. It is quite pricey as well. Lunch for two (2 entrees & 2 teas) was 32.00 (tip not included)."}
{"text":"Going to make this short. The employees are disrespectful and down right rude from the valet attendants to the hostess/greeter. The hostesses/greeters need to be reminded that the customers are the reason they get a paycheck. After living in Georgia for 20 years, the food is a far cry from authentic southern cooking. I can guarantee you nothing here is homemade. I do not recommend this restaurant. If southern fare is what you are craving, even Cracker Barrel is better than this place. I would rather take a beating than ever give Lo-Lo's another chance at my business."}
{"text":"I want to love LoLo's but since it moved...it has lost its SOUL...ITS AMBIANCE OF SOUTHERN CHARM AND ESSENCE OF SOUL FOOD...NOW JUST YUPPY..

I want real southern fried chicken , greens..(now the greens are bland as they seem to be leaving the spice out) cornbread, mac and cheese etc...the food is still pretty good but something just seems to be missing...I don't want yuppy I want SOUL..
soul music, southern spice, southern spirit....not white bland yuppy crap..."}
{"text":"Mrs. White's was closed. so had to go to LoLo's. Previous time there when it first moved from
other scottsdale location...food was kind of \"whityfied\". This time...place was very busy and
we waited a little longer than usual and then really waited a long time for the food to arrive.
We were given some corn bread and that was helpful...but it was an excessively long wait.
The manager gave an explanation and we were given desserts to go.
The food was much improved from our first visit to this location. Much more like Mrs. Whites
as I hope her family is involved with this location. Much better sides and the chicken was
better. But nothing replaces Mrs. Whites. I like the workers there and the comfort of the place...
ok if you are dying for soul food but watch out for busy times.
get better service and food at Mrs. Whites."}
{"text":"Trendy decor in this cute southern style spot. Chicken was finger-licking good! Waffles were yummy. Mac and cheese was creamy like Velveeta mac n cheese and not baked with breadcrumbs on top like I expected in a southern restaurant. Our server seemed distracted so we weren't enthused about the service but the manager checked in on us and got us our food immediately after noticing we had been waiting for a while. Recommended for sure. I would definitely go back if I lived here but I'm just visiting from NJ!"}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to come to the original location. It was late on a Thursday night. Like 8ish late and the fabulous Dottsy decided she wanted some chicken and waffles. So off we went to get their before they closed. This place is small and quaint and I can see how the lines are around the corner on the weekend. Get in and get out people lol. The staff were friendly and the food was delicious as always. Plus they were playing some jams while we enjoyed our food and they didn't rush us at all even though they were closed by the time we were done. If I am ever back on this side of town, I just may have to stop in and get my fried chicken and waffle fix."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place forever, I finally went with some co-workers. Honestly, it was good but I don't know what all of the fuss is about. I had, of course, the fried chicken (thighs) and waffles. The fried chicken was a bit bland for my taste, and the waffles were...waffles. I ate them both separately and together, and they were both just all right. Now some chicken-fried gravy might have helped the matter a bit but I really expected more from chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Looking for a place in Phoenix to get some early breakfast Easter Sunday (Matt's Big Breakfast was closed) and we came across Lo-Lo's. Boy, what a gem! We parked in front. The place is small and quaint but definitely has a lot of character. First thing I noticed was that the whole staff was really friendly, welcoming, and attentive. 

We came here for chicken and waffles so that's what we ordered. However, there was so much more on the menu that I seemed appetizing. The sweet tea came out in large jars. Nice! I had the 3 pc chicken and 2 waffles smothered in gravy and onions. My friends had the same without the gravy. The food came out quickly and piping hot! Whatever is in their seasoning, it was so good! The gravy and onions were even better! I could probably have done without one less waffle, but oh well, I was on vacation.

Lo-Lo's is definitely up there for me in terms of best chicken and waffles. I'd come here again if I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Called and they said they close at 11. Drove 30mins to get there, arrived at 10:20 and they said on a Saturday night \" sorry we closed early today\"... and they were still serving people. First time to try this place never again."}
{"text":"Can't say if it was good or not.  We were seated immediately around 1:15 in the afternoon in hopes of missing the lunch rush and we did. They looked to be at half capacity.  But after waiting for 15 minutes. Not even complimentary water.  Too, bad because I was really eager to give this place a thumbs up"}
{"text":"I've never been so disappointed, I'm at currently here waiting..., this is my second time coming here and never would I have returned if I would've known I was going to be treated like this. I have been waiting over 45 mins and not once has a server came to ask us for our drinks. The restaurant isn't even near being full and this service is absolutely horrible. I will tell everyone I know to never come here, so sad."}
{"text":"Like a lot of folks, I came here to see what chicken and waffles was all about.  The chicken was fair, and the waffles were fair, but nothing out of this world.  I didn't like that they could not split the check more than 2 ways.

If the meal had been 12 dollars I would have given it 4 stars at least, but 20+ dollars for what I had was definitely overpriced.  Will not go back again."}
{"text":"Came here with my family who were all very excited about the concept of chicken & waffles. We were seated quickly as we opted to sit outside rather than wait for a table inside, but the moment we got to our table it was like everyone forgot about us. The service was painfully slow, took 20 minutes to get our drinks & food took longer than average to come out. I ordered a side of fried okra & had to send it back twice because it was lukewarm & had obviously been previously frozen. Food was ok, my Omlett was good & the waffles were the best thing there. I don't eat chicken but my family all had chicken & waffles and all walked away wondering what all the hype was about."}
{"text":"I went here today for the first time with a friend and I really enjoyed the \"betty boop\". It came with one big waffle and a chicken thigh. The waffle was good, tasted like cinnamon, and the chicken was juicy and delicious! I also ordered a rasberry kool-aid just because it was available and I enjoyed that as well! I loved how quick we got the food and how attentive the servers were, even the host was great! 

I would come back for the chicken and waffles but also to try their \"soul food\"."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love themselves some good ole' fried chicken and waffles?

I got the Betty Boop which is a  fried chicken breast with a yummy waffle...the chicken was well flavored, hot, juicy, and fried to perfection!  Then pile on the maple syrup and hot sauce.  Hot sauce and maple syrup doesn't seems to go together, but it's delish.  Whoever thought to mix chicken, waffles, hot sauce and maple syrup all together is a genius."}
{"text":"I've been to both locations, and I wonder if is fair to rate them together or should I do it separate? 
The Phoenix location is way to small for me, I don't like feeling like I'm almost sitting on my fellow diners lap and, this is a huge pet peeve of mine, I HATE smelling like food! Which is inevitable because the place is tiny. On the other hand it does have charm to it and the food is delicious.

The Scottsdale location I can move, don't smell like food when I get out but is more sterile. And then there's the food....

I always ordered fried chicken (of course!) and the breast tends to be dry so I decided to do thigh and drumstick. Well, this last time  the dark meat was fried to a burn:(  And not only the skin but the meat too. I should have asked for two different pieces but I was starving, and my hunger won. A shame because I left without satisfying my craving for good fried chicken. The waffle was delicious as always and I ordered smothered potatoes which were very good. It seems with their mac & cheese  people either love it or don't. I'm on the 'don't' group. It tastes milky and not very cheesy to me. I may try it again, because I love mac & cheese and I have the hope that maybe it was just bad luck before?

Service is ok, sometimes better than others.

After careful consideration, I'll give it 4 stars. I'll visit again, I'm pretty sure, and then I may go up or down one star."}
{"text":"This is their new location so the reviews is for their old location. 

I have eaten on the central location and it was fine. This felt really un organized from the start and LOUD. We ordered food and everyone got their food but one person. No silverware. It was just one of those times where you know how it's going to pan out the rest of time. 

I wouldn't recommend going there if the service is like this and what happened to us."}
{"text":"The food is great and the ambiance is great. The hostes or maybe the owener and I had a very nice conversation as if we've know each other for years about her mother and my friend and traveling.  I will be back."}
{"text":"We went on a Thurs evening, 6ish, and as soon as I stepped out of the car, we were greeted by a group of friendly servers.  We got a table right away. I ordered the chicken tender basket with fries and my hubs had 2-pc chicken and a waffle.  We both ordered the sweet tea.  The sweet tea was delish...def no splenda in there but reminded me of my grandma's tea growing up!  Our food came out piping hot and was YUM! 
Ok, so chicken and waffles isn't the most extravagant cuisine for a 4-star review but Lolo's won me over with their service.  The food beat Roscoe's in LA and fancy schmancy steak houses could learn a thing or two from their customer service.  It was the perfect experience for what the restaurant is going for!"}
{"text":"You have got to be kidding me, $14 for a chicken breast, small at that, two wings and two sides! This was our second visit to Lo Lo's, the first being in the old location behind the parking lot, I don't think we will have a third visit, too costly for what you get and the quality of the chicken. The sides are good enough but I demand better value for my money."}
{"text":"I love me some chicken and waffles...was stoked about finding this place. 
Was NOT disappointed!  The chicken was a little dry (ordered the \"JUICY\" Betty Boob...wasn't so juicy) but it was still great!  Great service for our larger group"}
{"text":"Chicken not as good as KFC or even Basha's. Frozen Eggo waffles are better. 

Red velvet cake was very disgusting. Fried okra was soggy and too expensive. Soul food with no soul!

Waffles and chicken are an odd combination that might have worked had they been good.

Did I mention that the place is overpriced?

The best thing -- it provides employment for blacks right in the middle of whitey Scottsdale. The staff was very friendly (but incompetent) so I'll rate the place with 2 star instead of one!

I have been there twice and it was just as bad both times. Will never return."}
{"text":"Had the Lil Amadi and it was delicious. Chicken was crispy and waffle had a great cinnamon taste. Also the drinks come in huge mason jars."}
{"text":"Still waiting for my food. It's been over an hour Smh never coming back here again. Worst place to eat if u are really hungry"}
{"text":"What else can there be said about this place? 

The service? Excellent 
The atmosphere? Awesome 
The chicken? Crispy and juicy
The grits? Superb 
The waffles? Perfect 
The house hot sauce? F-ing amazing 

What are you waiting for? Get there and Get ya some."}
{"text":"This is the place to go when your looking to feel extremely full for a great price! Lo-Lo's has that Sunday-after-church feel and atmosphere. Its very jolly. The servers are all polite, and smile when they cross your path. If you don't like waiting, you should avoid going in Saturday & Sunday morning/afternoons. 

The location is grand, not even a mile away from Old Town Scottsdale! Inside, the place is tighty, and well kept. The wonderful smell of homemade waffles consumes the air overbearing the light smell of fried chicken... a perfect combination.

The waffles are AMAZING! They seemed to be seasoned the LoLos way, with a hint of cinnamon, and deliciously served with warmed syrup. The chicken is good as well, but lacks flavor, and is a little dry. I normally order a Betty's Boob, and all 3 times I've felt as if my chicken could use a little seasoning. To improve the taste I normally order a side of gravy. 

You will not leave this place hungry! You absolutely get your money's worth, for both food and service. For a nice filling meal of delicious, waffles, chicken, grits & eggs, & a nice big jar of Kool Aid, THIS IS YOUR PLACE! 

Needless to say, even with all the competition food-places surrounding LoLo's, its always a food party up in there!"}
{"text":"Since they moved to their new building the food is SO much better! The service at the PHX location is phenomenal too. I am from the South and this is the best comfort/soul food I have had in the 2 years I have been in Arizona."}
{"text":"At first it was like, Yes!  Chicken and Waffles....then I saw them slice the cake.  Yes, its airport food, but $7 for a tiny slice of cake?  Come'on.
Didn't even get a real piece... For $7, LoLo you can do better.

Will update the review after I try the chicken, but not high hopes so far.   Was so shocked had to review before I even took a bite.    Poor showing."}
{"text":"the chicken was good. the waffles was very good as they were nice and crispy and i dont usually care for waffles that much. the lemonade was too sweet. the mac and cheese was just normal and they seemed offended when we didnt finish it. the service was really nice. the environment was really nice too and it was a nice dine in place. there was plenty of choices on the menu as well with a ton of combinations."}
{"text":"I love ck . They have the best fried chicken in town. Also, the best waffles . Every time i crave fried ck i go to lo loa"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere service and food. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because my food wasn't thoroughly seasoned but that's a easy remedy."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS chicken there seasoning is bomb!!! Waffle was ok nothing to brag about but I do have to say my waffle was cold so maybe that affected the taste ??!
(I ordered trey treys)
Kool-aid is way too sweet ask for half water if you order it
My daughter loved the Mac and cheese with a drumstick

The only really bad thing about this place is the wait time for your food!!! Along with them bringing out half of your order while the other family members are left waiting for there order. 

Regardless we will be back again we were greeted warm and felt welcomed our waitress was sweet too."}
{"text":"I don't care if you're a visitor....native...your mamas mama made the best fried chicken and waffles....just come here. Roscoes has nothing on this place. Great good and selection, they have more than just chicken and waffles. Lucas was our server tonight, and he was great."}
{"text":"I don't think it met the hype I expected. 
The wait was slow, felt like slow motion for take out. Actual chicken was GOOD, the time to get it was wearing (place was empty,  off hours)."}
{"text":"Love this place. Their omelets are delish and have amazing country-style food. If you can grab a seat at the bar, you can avoid the consistent 30min wait for a table. The atmosphere is fun and lively, and very busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"Parking lot was empty and the valet hassled me to park with him.  I guess they work for tips because I felt like I was in Cabo and he was selling a timeshare.  People parking all around me and this guy was saying I would get towed if I didn't valet.  Great.

Food took forever which is okay if it's done right but the chicken was so overcooked I thought I was eating chicken jerky.  The waffles were just as bad.  Food truck waffles are better than this (I do like food truck waffles)."}
{"text":"Can you say \"food coma?\"

OMG... I think perhaps I am in a food coma as I type this review... not sure what more I can add that the other 75 reviews haven't covered, but I'll give it a shot!

We went to Lo-Lo's today after the Phoenix 10k.  There was a group of 7 of us total and we arrived around 10:30am.  We were told there would be a 30 minute wait (which was pretty accurate).  Some of us went in and filled up drink cups with Kool Aid, Lemonade, Iced Tea or a combination - the sugar totally held us over!

We studied the menu as we waited so we all knew what we were going to order before we sat down.  Rasheeta was our waitress and she was awesome - there were a few other guys helping her out as well.  I had the \"Nay Nay's\" which came with 2 waffles, 2 eggs (i ordered them over easy), and grits.  Oh, and I ordered a side of fried okra as well.  (I figured I may as well go all out 'cause who knows when I'll be back).  The waffles and grits had enough butter on them to feed an army of hungry runners.  I also had a bite of Jared's Fried Chicken.  Everything was delicious...

So much for all of the calories burned during the 10k.  Thanks Lo-Lo's for my fix of Southern Food - it reminded me of the good ol' days I spent in Atlanta!  

I'm sure I'm missing some highlights from our meal, but since I was there with a table full of yelpers, hopefully they will fill-in what I missed!"}
{"text":"Leave it to my husband to procrastinate making a Mother's Day brunch reservation... I love him, but reservations and planning ahead are not his strong point ;)

So, when he called Lo-Lo's at around 9:30am on Mother's Day morning, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there wasn't a wait and that they could accommodate our party of six.  I actually hadn't been to this Lo-Lo's location yet, and it worked out perfectly!

We headed over with his grandparents and our two kids in tow, and we were seated within about five minutes at a lovely table outside on the patio.  Service was attentive and friendly and the large portions of food were delicious!  

I was happy to see a few healthy options on the menu, and I went for an egg white omelette, but balanced it out with french fries, grits, and waffle.  Everyone at our table was pleased with their orders - kids included!

I'd absolutely return to Lo-Lo's on a special occasion or just a regular one.  I need to go for the chicken next time!

Thanks to Lo-Lo's for making my Mother's Day extra special!"}
{"text":"We were driving by Lo Lo's the other day and decided to give it a try for lunch, I'm so glad we did! The food was really good, and even though the waiter messed up my food a bit, I really enjoyed the mix of waffles and chicken! It was so good, we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"For service alone I'd give it 5 stars, but maybe it's been built up too much but I wasn't super impressed with the food. Pretty bummed that they didn't have the food they're famous for on the kids menu. The koolaid was delicious and sweet. Service excellent."}
{"text":"first off, this is not cheap and will be 15 bucks a person, but its really good! i always get the wings they serve at the dbacks stadium, with the hot sauce and fries, wings are huge and could really feed 2 people. my daughter does not eat chicken so she got the biscuits n gravy and loved it. the chicken and waffles are where its at tho! will be back one day, way to expensive for all the time. more like a tourist trap prices. same are roscoes in cali just here in phx"}
{"text":"The chicken is very good. The mac and cheese is really good too as well as the waffles. The sweet tea is the best I've ever had in my life"}
{"text":"Good meals at a reasonable price! Love the chicken/waffle combo. The waffle is the best I've ever had!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Okay I love this place, but the service is terrible. 
The hostess walked me around the restaraunt for 5 min asking me if each table would be suitable. (Just seat me)
Then- when we did find a table the other hostess gave it away to a different customer and she did nothing about it. Just asked if I wanted something else instead. Very unorganized. 
When I finally sat I waited 20 min and saw no one. 
Ridiculous!!! Had many employees walk past and no one offers help. Lack of management for sure. 
Finally ended up at the bar and they took good care of me, the wait for the food was all the reason not to come back. 
Sucks because it's so good!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here once before but decided to treat not only myself but my mother and daughter as well. When we first arrived there was a 20-25 minute wait but we decided to sit outside, so we were seated within 10 minutes. I ordered the soul food platter with 3 pieces of fried chicken smothered with onions and gravy and for my sides I had mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese (all for about $15). The macaroni and cheese was decent but nothing to brag about and the mashed potatoes were worse. The chicken, gravy, cornbread and peach cobbler tasted so good. If I do decide to go back I'll probably just settle for the chicken and peach cobbler. Our waiter wasn't very attentive, there were a couple of times we just waited until we were noticed but it was busy so I gave him the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try Lo-lo's chicken and waffles for a few months now. Our interest was triggered by an ice cold bottles water that they gave away after out cholla hike. Since then, Lo-lo's was part of the conversation whenever we talk about chicken & waffles.

Today, we finally got to try it!!!!!

My verdict, wellllll it was just ok... maybe even a little over hyped... Not a little... Its over hyped...

To be fair, we only ordered their signature Lo-lo's chicken and waffle. Maybe we should have ordered something else to get a good feel of their food. What we got were 3 pieces of southern fried chicken thigh (we requested for all thighs), 2 waffles with a scoop of butter on top and a side of syrup. the waffles were thin and was more on the crunchy side. The taste was ok, but there we a whole lot of flavor. The chicken, it was dry and small. Maybe my mom can cook a better chicken than what we got. I love the crispy of the chicken skin but the meat was just too dry. Take note, these are chicken thighs. They should be juicy and flavourful. I also orderede a side of egg... It was $3, for a scrambled egg with cheddar cheese. Extremely overpriced!

Again to be fair, this was just my experience. Maybe other guest had a better order or a better meal. I may have to come back again for a better experience. However, my first impression is not giving me anything to look forward to yet.

Would I come back? Maybe
Service? Average
Serving size? Not what I expected
Cleanliness? Bad. Had 2 strands of hair on my waffles
Price? Overpriced. Side of eggs for $3. It was probably 3 full spoons
Taste? Average

Oh and they don't allow outside drinks. Maybe the next door Jamba juice is not a good idea while waiting

{"text":"Tried this place out this morning since I've heard great things from fellow foodies. The wait time to be seated was minimal since it was early and during the week. The decor is clean and hip. Our server Amy was great but I'm knocking off a star for the wait time of the food. I opted for the number 8 or the \"Betty's boob\" which did not disappoint. It was a chicken breast and waffle plate. I also ordered a side of corn bread and a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. The chicken was flavorful and juicy and the waffle had just the right amount of sweetness. Definitely coming back next time I'm in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Came in from out of town and decided to try chicken and waffles for breakfast.  Went to the new location in Scottsdale.  Restaurant is gorgeous.  Super clean and decor is beautiful but casual. Ended up having lunch with the catfish and chicken with cornbread,  collard greens and fried okra.  This combo plate sounded too good to pass up and they had no problem serving it for  breakfast. The fried chicken was scrumptious and the catfish was great, neither greasy both perfectly done.  The breading was not overwelming and very  tasty.  The cornbread was  fabulous!  Moist, just a little sweet,  perfect with the  creamy butter.  The collard greens  were excellent and the fried okra was great.  Stuffed myself and walked out a happy  camper! Our server was VERY attentive, the  best  service I've had in a long time and the price, $40, tip included, was quite  reasonable for the amount of food. 
If you're in the mood for  great  soul food or just  excellent fried chicken,  I'd definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Soooooo gooooood. Comfort food to the max! I love the feel of Lo-Lo's and of course the kool-aid is fantastic. It has a home cooked meal taste. I'm happy to go back."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here yesterday for a friends birthday brunch. There was about 10 of us and they were able to accommodate us very well. Jen was our server and she was absolutely amazing! So kind and very attentive. Everyone finished their meals! I had the Toy Toy with a biscuit and gravey on the side and enjoyed every bite."}
{"text":"Went here after a great church service and ready to feed our tummies. Disclaimer: I am a Southerner, the bar is fairly high.

I had the Soulfood platter with smothered chicken and collard greens and Mac n cheese.  I have criticized as being undercooked and salty before.  Today they were excellent.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I wanted to ask for more gravy but didn't and had some left over after I was done so smothered chicken, check!  The Mac n cheese was really good but perhaps a bit too creamy.  Mac n cheese aficionados will know what I mean.  I like ever so bit of crust with top toasted and a slight bit of clumpiness... but the flavor was there.

My daughter had the shrimp and grits which were excellent if a tad bit over produced.  See the pic but the shrimp were plentiful and cooked with nice amount of spice like my family generally likes it.  The grits were creamy.  Why overproduced?  The melted cheese on top.  But I didn't look at the description or I would have asked for light cheese but my daughter ordered her own meal.  

Wife had grilled cod which she enjoyed and son and no in law both had fried breast, wing and waffle.  My son finished all but a quarter of his waffle if that's any indication.  That fried chicken is rivaled only by Ms' Whites... Nobody beats Ms Whites' fried chicken.  

This was Easter Sunday so I'm going to put slow service aside... we never received platters for our tasty fried green tomatoes.  Gotta add this blessing.  As we were paying our check manager brought us a $15 receipt and said family in the booth behind us wanted to help pay for our meal.  She wrote on the receipt: \"Sorry for my 2 year old's antics! God bless!\"  First we briefly noticed the 2 year old and he was doing what any 2 year old would do and caused us not one second of concern but we will surely pay it forward.  Happy Easter!  He is risen!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Phoenix from CA and wanted to enjoy a good dinner with my husband. We both had chicken and waffles with Mac n cheese. Back home Roscoes chicken and waffles is our spot and I'm proud to say that Lolo's will be our spot whenever we come to Phoenix. Their Kool aid reminded me of my childhood  on a hot summer day. Great food. Excellent service. Nice environment."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, flawless chicken and waffles.  A must-try if you love fried chicken and/or waffles.

One item of note though: coffee is $3.  Yes, three dollars.  It was fine, but I think I paid about six times what I would have paid at Starbucks.  So that seemed a bit high to me.  However, the food was delicious and well worth it.

A very cool vibe, clean, bright, well-maintained with great photos and art all over the place.  Gospel music playing loud at 7AM on a Friday morning.  A great waitress.  A lot of fun."}
{"text":"Waffles were better than their southern style chicken. Slightly disappointed with the fried chicken. The batter needed a little bit more flavor. Red velvet pancakes were amazing. Also ordered house made lemonade which was very good and refreshing"}
{"text":"So I've heard a lot of great stuff about LoLo's... I've tried it twice and ordered two of the top recommended meals and drinks. So not impressed. At all. I honestly could find more flavorful and moist chicken at my local Fry's.... And I'm not exaggerating in the slightest. The \"dranks\" are so full of sugar, it turned my stomach upside down both times. A meal literally evacuated and about $25 wasted. Thanks LoLo's, I am now 10 lbs lighter than before. The \"Phat Azz Sammich\" had zero flavor. The chicken breading was moist and flaked off as I lifted it. Eww.. Who wants flaky unflavored chicken? The \"Tre Tre\" was equally underwhelming... I mean I know some people don't like salt.. But why zero salt, two cups of cinnamon and a pound of sugar in your meals? Not returning ever again."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday and the food and service was absolutely horrible. I cannot believe I left a tip. I've been to Lolo's on multiple occasions and it was always amazing, but after yesterday, I don't think i'll ever give them any business again. It took nearly an hour to get our food. The waiter took the wrong order and then it took him 20 minutes to bring out the right food since he stopped to talk with the guy about the Mayweather fight on the table next to us. The food was not good. I usually splurge when I come to Lolo's but yesterday it was horrible. My toddler didn't even eat their mac and cheese. It was so dry and disgusting. No more Lolo's for me.   We ordered two meals and my total came out to be almost $40."}
{"text":"I have never been to a lo-los before but I wanted some chicken and waffles after I picked up my fiancée from work. I ordered the baby ray and my fiancée got the lo-los we also got a side of Mac and cheese as well as cheesy grits. Our server was fantastic as was the waffles and the chicken. 
The four stars is because the sides were very bland, and even though the chicken was good, the baby Ray chicken got a little more soggy than I expected because of the gravy. If this was just based on the service, it would be 5 stars, they offered drink refills whenever I was low, they answered all my questions and best of all no wait. All in all a great meal, and I will be back, I just wouldn't recommend the baby ray."}
{"text":"This a great place for chicken and waffles. I am from LA and have had Roscoe's  chicken and waffles. I liked the Oreo pancakes. It had a lemon flavored syrup. My girl friend had the chicken and waffles and she said it was better than Roscoe's. They were accommodating for our big party. They have a back room but they have you wait until all of your party is here. The mac and cheese was awesome. It tasted like it was made from scratch. It was creamy and extra cheesy. The staff was extremely friendly. The host, the server. Everyone. The only draw back was they don't do side substitutions.    I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Food is great and the new building is quite roomy and nice (even if I miss the nostalgia of the old location). But I can't give it 5 stars because of the rule of not allowing multiple credit cards for payment. This policy - especially with large parties - was pretty inconvenient. There were people in my party who were annoyed enough not to come back. :-("}
{"text":"Honestly I don't think this is real soul food.  The only thing good there is their waffles & their red velvet cake well it use to be good when my auntie worked there  if you havent tired the red velvet then you haven't lived fr but other than that they food not even all that. If you think this is real soul food its not. They food barely have seasoning but they kool aid be bomb"}
{"text":"I've gone here 4 times for breakfast and they are suppose to open at 9:00am. We've gone anywhere from 9:10-9:30am and the doors are never open. Employees are inside, but don't open the door. One time I called that night in hopes to let the owners know, but the manager that was working the AM shift answered and said he couldn't find the keys. Seems to be a consistent problem since this is the 4th time (not exaggerating) this has happened. It's a shame because it's a nice place with great breakfast. Ever time this has happened, they lose the 8-10 customers waiting outside to US Egg across the street. Hope the owner finds out and fires the AM manager for clearly not caring about this business or reputation."}
{"text":"Simply Amazing, great customer service, my catfish was cooked perfect, the kool-aid was delicious, highly recommend"}
{"text":"I've personally never been into the whole chicken and waffles idea so until recently I didn't even try it. I'm years late but it was so good. It gets REALLY busy at times and there was a bit of a wait but it was worth it. Unfortunately I'm from Oklahoma and we don't have them here or I would be a regular."}
{"text":"Having grown up in the south, I was anxious to try Lo-Lo's and was so glad that I did.  Our visit was on Friday evening around 6 pm, and although the dining area was full, our wait was only about 20 minutes.  All the servers were busy workers, very friendly and helpful, which is one of my main criteria for returning, no matter the quality of the food.  I was impressed first by the chicken.  It was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, and even better, tasted just like the southern fried chicken I grew up eating.  The mac and cheese, though not gourmet, was also the familiar mac and cheese of my youth.  The rice and gravy, which had a bit of  a zip to it,  was good, and the banana pudding, although not as creamy as I make, tasted like the best homemade banana pudding out there.  The only thing that was not to my liking were the collared greens.  The taste was good but they were served more at room temperature, not hot.  I will definitely  go back to try more of the comfort foods I grew up eating!"}
{"text":"In a recent review for Roscoe's in Long Beach (CA), I noted that the chicken and waffles combination of grease and carbs, accompanied by sweet tea, was, for years, my late-night, too-drunk-to-care breakfast of choice. 

Now that I'm sober and all grown up, my standards have risen and my expectations have changed: the food had better be good, and the venue's owners should care at least as much as I do about the quality of the service I'm afforded when I spend $10 to $20 on a $5 plate of food that I can cook at home.  Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles in Phoenix gets me, and gets that meal just right.

Their chicken is juicy and tender inside, and, importantly, crispy crunchy outside, coated with a deliciously complex and savory seasoning ostensibly passed down through several generations. The waffle, often an afterthought on menus offering C&W, is a fluffy delight that holds its own against the bird; think pancakes, with character.

Service at Lo-Lo's is provided by a team of young people who earnestly hope for their customers' comfort and well-being. The servers' efforts seem neither rote nor insincere.

These positive things being said - and I'm emphatically positive about Lo-Lo's - it must also be noted that the design and content of Lo-Lo's advertising and marketing materials is an odd combination of racist and \"ratchet\" imagery and language - unsettling and confusing to those not in on the joke, and no less bothersome to those unsure whether they should laugh, when they do get it. 

I won't give examples, but if you're curious, imagine Jews doing \"we're sneaky and cheap\" schtick, or Jeff Foxworthy commenting on his branchless family tree. If your imagination's piqued, visit Lo-Lo's online.

Notwithstanding the awkwardness, I'll dine at Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles again. I can ignore what I don't enjoy about the business, understanding that it's not for me, or about me. 

And the food really is quite good.

{"text":"This place is awesome with one terrible server. I don't remember her name but she was the worst server I've come across in years.  She brought out the wrong food, never came to refill drinks or ask how our food was. She never cleared our plates from the table when we were obviously done eating, just came by the table long enough to drop off the bill and left our dirty plates on the table.  I would've given this place four stars if the service was average. She was so bad I can only blame it on poor management and non-existent training.  Food was great and I liked the menu selection. Too bad the server ruined the experience. I am weary to try eating here again. Maybe the Phoenix location has better staff."}
{"text":"WoW..... A forty minute wait on Sunday.....but boy it's was worth it. 

We got seated sooner than the forty minutes. We had a booth with red seats (nice touch). The menu was simple and sweet, loving all of the southern names of menu options. It made ordering fun!!! 

I ordered two chicken wings with a waffle. The wings were hot and moist and the waffle were well done and crispy (just how I like it). 

They had an assortment of Kool-Aid which came in a Mason jar. Yummy!  I had the Arnold Palmer! Delicious! 

The food takes a little time to come out but it's worth it.  The price is right!!! If you love southern food (especially fry chicken)  

LoLo Chicken and Waffle is just the place to visit!"}
{"text":"It was a cool place. The chicken was good, the waffles were nothing to write home about. The best chicken and waffles I ever had come from The Breakfast Klub in Houston."}
{"text":"Very good chicken and waffle spot.   Not expensive and very tasty overall. Had chicken, Mac n cheese and a waffle. Service was great drinks were great and just a nice environment to be with friends or even by yourself. Will recommend and will try another location when I go out of town."}
{"text":"I love Lolo's.

You come to Lolo's when you're craving soul food, and it doesn't disappoint.  Everything is served hot and tasty.  Kool-aid in many flavors is readily available which really just completes your meal.  Staff is super cool, be nice to them and tip them well.  Also, try the red velvet cake.  Nothing better."}
{"text":"I had never been here but have always heard good things. My expectations were blown out of the water. I had three pieces of fried chicken, perfectly breaded and friend with the right amount of seasoning. I added sides of rice with butter and green beans with red potatoes, a fitting accomplice. There was also a softball sized piece of cornbread which was the perfect addition to the meal. I was impressed with the quality and amount of food. Washed it down with a few glasses of purple look-aid for good measure. Now if they only had a location further west..."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Great portion size with inventive cocktails.  Chicken was on point as well as the shrimp and grits.  My stomach is !!!!!"}

{"text":"I love it every time.
Perfectly fried chicken and excellent waffles.
Haven't been to the new location yet, so I'm excited to check it out."}
{"text":"The best waffle and chicken I ever had. Service was quick and the sweet tea was delicious."}
{"text":"Do you like chicken?  Do you like waffles?  The answer to both is obviously yes.  And what better place to sate your hunger than at Lo-Lo's?

You're already there, so just get the sweet tea also.  No one is judging you here."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give this place 1 star. It deserves negative stars, if possible. 

Absolutely horrible services. Food took 15 mins to arrive. The chicken was dry and the waffle was soggy. My main reason for this horrible rating is because services was that bad, and the food didn't make it any better. So my overall experience is negative. 

If you want to waste your time and money, then I definitely would recommend this place. If not, then I recommend just going somewhere else. Anything is better than this place."}
{"text":"Great food, Great service! So good we came twice within one weekend. 

Came to LoLo's for the chicken and waffles and enjoyed every bit of our food. The drinks were also good. 

We ordered chicken & waffles, grits, mac n cheese. I didn't really like the mac n cheese. It could've been better. However, everything else taste great. I love the taste of cinnamon on the waffles. The grits were fluffy and buttery, the chicken was crispy and flavorful. Chicken reminded me of my grandma's chicken.

The second visit I ordered the catfish and waffle. I believe I like the chicken and waffle combo better, but the catfish was also good. I think I was expecting more than one piece of catfish, or maybe a larger piece of catfish. 


My friend ordered a side salad and chicken wings and said they were very good. My other friend ordered the same thing each time. Ordering the chicken breast and waffle with a side of peanut butter. He loved it! 

The bartender/ waitress was very attentive, both times we visited this restaurant over the course of the weekend. The drinks were reasonably priced and had the right amount of liquor. Her recommendations on drinks were spot on and so were the mimosas. 

I would recommend coming here with your family, friends, coworkers, etc."}
{"text":"What's up Scottsdale ? Why the bad reviews ?
LOLOS is hands down the best of its kind. I'm a Californian and they make Roscoes seem quite amateur.

LOLOS ..chicken was superb. I would put it only second to Gus' in Memphis. Fried Green Tomatoes were fantastic. Even their waffle was great and not just \"filler.\"

Service was outstanding. Maurice , the manager was so friendly and talked to me for quite a while. Our server was talkative and sweet.

It's a must visit. Awesome decor also."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas, so I know GOOD southern food.  I can't stress enough HOW AUTHENTIC and utterly AMAZING this place is.  The family who owns this and all their employees are the SWEETEST people. I use to work in the service industry for a long while and it's hard to come by waiters who are sincerely nice.  Best service I've EVER had and AMAZING AMAZING food. The Sweet Tea is the REAL DEAL.  The atmosphere: Feels like I'm eating at my mom place, relaxed, friendly; like I'm back in Texas.  PLEASE I URGE you, go to Lo-Lo's!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here and everything was going smooth. We came in about 5:30pm and it was getting busy. We waited to be seated and I thought it was pretty cool they had a couch you can chill on while you wait. 

When we were seated, our server greeted us in a timely manner. We asked for some help since it was our first time and he did a fine job letting us know what was popular and pointed us to certain things I asked about. I asked him to go ahead and get our drinks while we decide what we wanted to get.

He came back and asked if we were ready and we said that we were. We placed our order (Number 3, which is 3 pc chicken with two waffles, and a chicken strip basket with fries and a side of corn bread) and then he asked \"So what did you guys want to drink, again?\" Wait a minute. I thought we had already given him our drink order and instead of coming with them, he came and asked what we wanted. That was a tad annoying. 

Our order was brought out by a lady who didn't really acknowledge us. Basically \"who had this or that\" and placed them in the center of the table anyway. She just left without saying a word or asking if we would like anything else. Right away, we noticed we had gotten everything except for our corn bread. We waited for our waiter to make his rounds but he didn't come back. It took awhile but he came to seat someone else so the couple seated at the table next to us got his attention and said that they were missing a few items from their order. So we weren't the only ones. 

After a few trips back and forth to them because he kept forgetting things they were asking for, I got his attention and said that we were missing corn bread. He said he would bring them out. I saw him a few times after that helping other customers and that's fine but he came back to our table and asked how we were doing...without our corn bread. I had to remind him again that we needed corn bread. We were almost done with our meal by this time.

After he finally brought it to us, he started coming around a little more. At that point, I wasn't sure whether or not if it had slowed down or not. I figured it did since he was coming around some more. It was kind of too late, anyway.

When it came time to bring us our bill, he had to ask us what we had ordered today. I was surprised... He said they had misplaced our order. How does that even happen? I've never heard of such a thing...EVER. I should have just told him that service was lousy and since they had lost our order stub, I didn't have to pay for the food. But since I did eat it (cause I was hungry mind you) and possibly a little too understanding, I gave him my entire order again.

So we paid and started leaving and I saw that it was as packed as ever. Worse than when we had arrived. I didn't understand why he would have time to keep checking on us at the end of the meal as opposed to during the meal. Now, I do understand that he may have been new or may even have been too slammed but shouldn't waiters and any establishment at the very least come by and ask if you were doing okay? IDK but the service wasn't on par with some other little restaurants I've been to. 

As for the food, to me it really wasn't anything special. The chicken wasn't like how they make it out to be and the waffles were still kind of dough-y. I may have gone at a bad time but it's a restaurant and they should be consistent. The chicken strips weren't too bad and the best part of the meal was the fries. I gave one-star for the food and one-star for the service. 

I guess I was expecting a lot more from the reviews and reputation Lo Lo's had..."}
{"text":"I had the chicken and waffles with red kool aide/lemonade. The customer service was excellent and our food was ready quickly.The chicken was really good and the waffle was ok. I like Roscoes waffles's way better. No waffle compares to a Roscoe's waffle lol."}
{"text":"The wait was entirely TOO long, the service was \"meh\" ....took over 45 mins to get our food...the waitress came over at the 40 min mark and offered us cornbread/butter...but we didn't even have water on the table!
Maybe it was the fact that is was New Year's Eve day...and everyone was out and about!

I ordered the chorizo and eggs and it was actually really good...and loved that they served huge tortillas!  I have heard wonderful things about this place and I am sure if I am ever in Phoenix again, I will give it another shot!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to a Lo-Lo's!  Met up with some folks for the Yelp Breakfast Club's first meeting.  I had the Stupid Fries which were very good.  I will have to go another time to try the chicken and waffles which were receiving high marks from everyone else at the table.  Service was good.  We got there early enough on a Sunday so we didn't have to wait for seating.  They only seat complete parties and don't split checks so bring cash for a group.  They do provide a receipt identified by seating position."}
{"text":"So I missed the Yelp UYE but 2 months later Smunch visited and I made it.  This time, as opposed to the UYE at the Scottsdale location, I did indeed have a chicken and waffle along with cheesy grits.  Good stuff!  This is one of those legendary downtown restaurants worth making the drive and maybe a bit of a wait for."}
{"text":"We got there early on a Sunday and beat the crowd. We were seated right away. Other than a couple of pauses the service was pretty good. Our waitress was pleasant and pretty much knew the menu and helped my friend build a plate of food from sides to fit what she wanted. Nobody that knows me will be surprised I got the stupid fries which are covered in gravy, among other things. This was my first visit at this location but had been to the old Scottsdale location. I like the interior better. I could see where parking would suck if it was busy, somebody mentioned they do valet during known busy times. I don't think it is a solid 4 but I couldn't see giving them a 3."}
{"text":"If I were to move out of Phoenix tomorrow, Lo Lo's would be the place that I would regretfully leave behind.  Its still pretty unbelievable to me that chicken n waffles is still a unique concept around the US -- this combo should be served at baptisms, first communions, bar mitzvahs, wedding, and wakes.  Indeed, every time is a good time for chicken n waffles.

However, ONE specific time exceeds all the others.  That is, chicken n waffles as hangover food.  Nothing soaks up those poisons like a Tre Tre's platter with a side of grits and a Dr Pepper/Red Kool Aid.

This is a perfect place to take out of towners, particularly because of what most consider a bizarre concept (until they try it .. then they're like all \"ooooohhhhh\") and for the cool southern-style coziness."}
{"text":"Just moved to Arizona and went to lunch here the other day. I got the soul food platter with one catfish, chicken, waffles and red beans and rice.  I was left very satisfied . The amount of food for the price is awesome. I was also impressed with the drink selection.. It was great. Service was awesome, I definitely recommend this for great soul food."}
{"text":"The lo-los at the airport is not the same as the remote location. The waffles were not the same and the chicken sort of tasted like chicken from a knock off version. It had no seasoning and I was not happy with the meal at all."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't updated my review!

Lo Lo's I had been craving you!!!!! Ever since I had a bite of your fried chicken I have been hooked, and I don't even like fried chicken!!! 

The combination of your fried chicken and waffle just can't be met anywhere else, I even have to say I like I like you more than that Roscoes down in LA, ooooowwwwweeeee just can't get enough!

I ordered the #8, the betty boop, which is a waffle and fried breast, and omg its still has good as the 1st time I tried you, I swear I will try other numbers, but when you already had perfection its hard looking for something else!

The Kool Aid is still on point, cold & in a jar, love that stuff!

This time I did try the mac & cheese which was perfectly cooked and just the right about of cheeseyness to it. 

Thank you Lo Los for yet another perfect meal!  Oh and ladies,,,let me tell you EYE CANDY forsure!"}
{"text":"Saturday morning was 4th meet up for the breakfast club uye, and this time Lo Lo's Chicken & Waffles was picked, as before with the other events, I called the venue to give them the heads up that we are headed their way, this time the hostess who picked up the phone didn't ask for a name or time we were coming in, just said ok, so I arrived at Lo Lo's about a  1/2 hour early to let them know that we will be a party of 10 to 15 at 10am, the hostess this time said well did you call and I explained what happened when I did, she said well next time as for me. Oh ok, and then when it came to be seated we were told we were not getting seated until entire party was here and by this time 8 of us were there, so I told her call us a party 8 and let's get breakfast going! I have to say though Lo Los was the place for huge parties sat morning, there were 2 other groups of 15 waiting to be seated as well. 

We had 2 servers, a nice young lady and Jaqwan, and let me tell you, both servers were great!  Jaqwan was hot on making sure we were taken care of from drinks to food. Love a place with great service! And yes Lo Los was busy but they never looked or made us feel rushed!

I orderd the #8 betty boop , chicken breast with a waffle, I don't know what is it, but I can't get enough of that fried chicken! I don't even eat fried chicken but this place always has me craving more! This was my 1st time to the Phoenix location; I have been to the one in Scottsdale a number times, and I have to say I love the feel of this place, the opened ceiling in the main dining area, the nice comfy green sofa seating in the patio area, even the outside seating was nice, and it was a perfect day to be eating out side but I will have to try that another time.

So regardless of which location, I love me some Lo Los! You betcha I will be back!

Also would like to thank everyone who attends the breakfast club uye, its fun to see everyone and to have a great meal with! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Have you been to the new spot? No you haven't? You have to check them out now!  

Not only do they have a new place, but a new menu too, with sooo much to offer, this time around I went for the fried green tomatoes, those were delish just what I had been wanting, crave them sometimes and now it's nice to know Lo Los can fix that craving too! Also ordered the Lo Los punch, which is red Kool-Aid with a kick, oh that baby was sweet!

Even with all the new items on the menu, I had to order the #8, a perfectly fried chicken breast and waffle, I don't even like fried chicken but I crave Lo Lo's!

Love the new spot, love the new menu and love the good food!"}
{"text":"Best soul food restaurant I've visited in years!  Definitely get the soul food platter. The catfish & greens are on point. Nothing like eating great food with old school selections in the background.  Best place to visit in AZ."}
{"text":"Overpriced, unhealthy food!  Popeyes and Fry's have bigger and better chicken  Never going back there!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed! I spent $12 on 2 sides of veggies thinking I would have leftovers to take with me on the plane.... NOT! I ordered the collards and maybe had enough for 3 bites! I work for a major airline, and I can guarantee I will not recommend this place! They need to either come down on prices or ramp up the portions!"}
{"text":"What kind of restaurant closes at 6 PM? We tried to get down in the area for an hour so that our guests from out of state could try it. We got through the doors of the full restaurant at 6:03 only to be turned away. This would have been my second time eating there. That second time isn't going to happen after this."}
{"text":"Man oh man this place is good! Visiting from LA  and if you know LA you know Roscoes. Sorry Roscoes but Lo-Lo's has got the tastiest, most tender, juicy fried chicken I have ever had. And the waffles just melt in your mouth with a flavor explosion. Lo-Lo's is now my second reason to move to AZ."}
{"text":"Love their chicken & waffles!!  We ate there for dinner one evening...  We could not get enough, came back the following week for lunch.  Just speaking of chicken & waffles, I need to make a visit again SOON!!"}
{"text":"The waffles were good and sweet, the staff was friendly and the atmosphere was down to earth.  The only real drawback and it is a drawback, is we had to wait outside for a good twenty minutes in the late summer afternoon.  There is not waiting room and if the place is full when you get there you have to wait out on the sidewalk."}
{"text":"It had been a while since I had been here and it didn't disappoint.  However,  it seemed a little more expensive than the last time.  The wait was 45 minutes and three line didn't stop.  There was still a line when we were done with our meal.  

So...I had the chicken gizzards on rice. They were tender and cooked just right... not too much bredding. Just how they should be cooked.   

Hubby had biscuits and gravy with potatoes.  He's a big eater and almost didn't finish all his food.  

One of my girls had red velvet pancakes. They were amazing!  Tasted just like red velvet cake! And one of our other girls had the traditional chicken and waffles.  The waffle was made with cinnamon, which was a nice added touch and she got 2 chicken legs with her waffle.  

We didn't go away hungry, which is a bonus for the price."}
{"text":"Customer service at Lo-Lo's needs to be improved. I had 3 failed attempts to get as order to go. I called and was placed on hold for 5 minutes. I waited on the phone because I know it is a busy establishment. I hung up and called on my way there. I was told I could not place a order without paying for it  over the phone. Since i was driving and was just 2 minutes away, I said I would wait until I got there to place the order. I had to wait over 30 minutes after my order was taken,  only to be told it would be an additional 10 minutes. I value my time and the whole process at this point was over an hour. I was made to feel that my time held no value what so ever.  People came in the restaurant after me and was served their food  before I was. I have to agree with the other comments that the food is the best of the best, however it takes more than just good food to run a business. Customer service should be the main item on the menu and value customer that appreciate Lo-Lo's  good food. I try to support all black businesses in Phoenix  however poor customer service would make anyone rethink giving support to a busines that does not look out for complete customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"I grew up in the South eating copious amounts of delicious soul food and as an adult I have traveled a great deal in search of places that can still do it right, and I am here to tell you: THIS IS IT, folks!

The food is indescribably delicious and well executed and the staff could NOT be more pleasant and attentive, but one of the most important reasons to high tail it over to Lo-Lo's is because this place is a rapidly vanishing breed and a foodie experience you won't ever forget.

Abandon your diet, forget counting your cholesterol and treat yourself to a meal that will make you weep with pleasure.  Life is too short for Subway sandwiches when a temple of deliciousness like Lo-Lo's graces this weary world.

And this I vow: I will never visit the city of Phoenix again without stopping to eat at Lo-Lo's.  And I can't wait to experience Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe!"}
{"text":"Happened to be bicycling by the larger digs yesterday at 6PM and  there was no line. There also is no entrance from the parking lot - people have to walk around to the street to get in the place. I would love them if the perfection stopped right there as long as the food wasn't poisonous.

But then, wonderfully funky interior design in an old commercial space, top notch staff, perfectly fried drumsticks, wonderfully textured fresh waffles, excellent okra and greens, really good lemonade and thou beside me looking at Carlos Rivas' rooster. Bicycling home at sunset. 

What more can be asked of life?"}
{"text":"I was honestly craving chick fil a. I have never eaten before, and I am surprised by their quality of food. I order their chicken tenders, which were extremely moist and asked for the fries to be slightly season. They were mind blowing. I also had the mac & cheese which was delicious with a mushroom -based sauce, that you can hardly taste"}
{"text":"Loved their chicken, loved the waffles and loved my punch!  Great place!  Great atmosphere and service!  There can be a slight wait but worth it."}
{"text":"I was forced to go here, it was my first day of work and they all had this lunch thing prepared, so I had no choice but to go. I honestly do not find anything interesting about this place. First of all the location and place is horrible (sorry, but I don't want to get shot during my lunch hour) the food is nothing that you cannot find somewhere else... even KFC has greasy fried chicken. I respect everyone's opinions and tastes, but this is not for me. Unless you want to weight 300 lbs, this is not a place for people that like to watch what they eat/weight/healthy. Too much fat, grease, and sugar.... one star..."}
{"text":"The manager Eian is the definition of trash. First, he had the nerve to talk to us like we were beneath him. Secondly, he racial profiled us and acted like we couldn't afford to buy a bottle of champagne. Thirdly, he refused to serve us mimosas because we were \"apparently\" at our 6 per person limit. However, I had been drinking Kool-aid all day. I could go on and on about how trash this manager is, but I won't waste anymore of my precious time. Nevertheless, You go the right one Eian. How dare you assume that I can't afford to buy a bottle of champagne because I am per say not caucasian? You are a Manager at Lolo's Chicken and Waffles. I have probably done more in my short 22 years of living than you have done. The way you present yourself is even sloppy. You should spend more time working on your presentation and customer service skills than you do racial profiling.  The grace of God saved you from my wrath, because I was very close to letting you know just who the heck I am and what I'm about. No worries though, you will probably still be working here in 3 years. Stagnant. 

Future Customers,
You better reclaim your time and not waste it here. Godspeed."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'd consider myself a regular at Lolo's. My husband and I take most of our out-of-state guest to Lolo's for the experience; friendly staff, Kool- aid served in mason jars, beers in brown bags and the food of course! There is ALWAYS a wait of at least 30 mins, which we don't mind, it's worth the wait. Well today we had the WORST experience ever. We walked out! First an hour wait, okay Sunday afternoon understandable. Finally we were seated, only to wait some more;10 minutes and no server has come to take our drink order or even say \"I'm you're server and I'll be back for your drink order.\" I asked the hostess Destiny for a manager. Destiny was gracious enough to take our drink order and finally someone comes to check on us and take our order. We asked for China hot wings, the phat azz samich, 2 chicken tender baskets with a waffle and the steak and eggs.  5 mins later our wings come out. 20 mins later and still no food and people who were seated like 20 mins after us are getting their food. WTF! At this point my husband is pissed he got up talked to our server came back to the table left 20$ and we left. 
We have NEVER, even during busier hours, have had such bad service at Lolo's. If the kitchen is slow and behind the server could have let us know come by the table and offer refills. Nope we didn't even get that. The server even followed us outside because we were short (I ordered a mimosa) the audacity! Anyway it's gonna be a long long while before we go back to Lolo's. What upsets me the most is toddler didn't get her waffle and she LOVES their waffles. They could've at least brought my daughters food out. Ugh!"}
{"text":"I've been to LoLo's a few times. I always order chicken and waffles plus sides and red kool aid. The food was great as usual. The service is usually good but today it was a little slow."}
{"text":"Enjoy breakfast with my family today! My first time at this place and I loved every bite! I ordered the catfish and waffle...delicious!"}
{"text":"I met Lo-Lo for the first time this weekend and boy was she beautiful. I can't stop thinking about her golden brown hair and her soft butter lips which tasted ever so sweet. 

It's a shame she lives 5 hours away. She promised to bake me some of her delicious cornbread the next time we meet. Mmmhmm."}
{"text":"It's crazy, but every single review that I've read on here (both good and bad) are right on the money.  How can that be?  Here's the breakdown...

1) Lolo's is slow slow.  With a half full restaurant and a hefty number of servers (we had no less than three waiters working our table) our food took exactly an hour to come out of the kitchen.  Granted, the food came out of the kitchen hot and a manager apologized for another table that came in after us for being served first (apparently our order took an extra 15 minutes because of the fish, which takes longer).  Still, there was nothing that I ate there that was worth waiting an hour.  Astoundingly, when we walked out, the restaurant filled and people were waiting for tables, leading me to believe that they'd have to wait no less than two hours for their food.  Not worth it - I could fry my own chicken (and it'd be damn good) in less time.

2) Speaking of the chicken, it's solid.  Don't be fooled - it's superior to KFC, especially with a smattering of extra salt and hot sauce (it's a little underseasoned for my liking, but I err on the side of salt - plus, there's salt on the table, so I can't dock stars for it).  That all being said, if you've been waiting for over an hour to eat, it's hard to be wowed.  Maybe they were understaffed on the fryers or something?  Fish on the other hand, both the redfish (cod) and catfish were so friggin' good.  Perfect cornmeal batter and delectable tartar sauce on the side, they made the wait almost bearable.

3) Servers are extremely laid back, though most are exceptionally cool.  There was one waitress who, when you said please and thank you, said absolutely nothing.  Inexcusably rude, whether you are in a restaurant or not.  It's just basic manners.  Still, just about everyone else working there that we interacted with was very friendly and we even managed a few laughs.

4) Sides are mixed - mac and cheese was mediocre and a little bland, greens were zippy with pepper and vinegar, cheesy grits were creamy and light, red beans and rice had excellent flavor but needed salt, cornbread was moist and buttery and fried okra was crisp and not a bit slimy.  Try the Stupid Fries - an addictive mix of bell peppers, onions, cheese, shredded chicken and gravy, all atop a mess of crisp fries.  The gravy makes the whole dish, perfectly seasoned and addictive in flavor.

All in all, Lolo's is neither a hit or a miss.  In a city that is pretty sparse on soul food, this place stands out due to the lack of competition.  But there are some glaring points that should still be addressed before I could even fathom giving out 5 stars for this place.  And all this coming from a southern-fried girl who is ready (and I mean ready) to tuck into a real plate of soul food the way it's supposed to be.  Solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"Was awesome. Food was incredible. Southern as my taste buds wanted and expected. Craving it on the regular."}
{"text":"The location is bigger, but now they don't have enough staff to accommodate the higher volume of customers. Waited an hour to get our food. The waitress told us we'll get our food shortly 2 times and we still waited. Spoke to the manager and all he said was \" we apologize\". The food is great ! If you have all day to sit around and wait for your food, this is the place to go.

PARKING SUCKS ! Shares the parking with a hotel and the hotel has more parking. Moved to a bigger location, but less parking spaces is no bueno. The old location at least shared space with the grocery store, so parking was no problem ! Smart move !"}
{"text":"Ugh...still horrible service after a year.  Pathetic!  I guess they think they have cornered the market, they could give a shit less.  No apologies,  nothing. Final appearance here, they suck! Saw so many getting service before us, drinks, etc...just not very customer orientated.  Boo! Been here an hour, still no food.

Food, good...service sucks."}
{"text":"I've now been here 4 times in the past year. There chicken and waffles are always good. The reason for my three stars is that during this visit I had the worst service. I didn't catch the waiters name but it took him 10 mins just to come and acknowledge me. It took another 20 minutes to get my lunch. To top it off I couldn't even track him down to get my bill. I finally had the busboy go track him down.  Horrible service."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Lolo's for the first time and I fell in love with it! The server was very friendly, the food came out quickly and it was delicious! I got the \"Betty Boob\", which was the chicken breast and waffles...amazing! 

My favorite part was the atmosphere. It was comfortable and family friendly. The tables were a little close together but that seemed to lend itself to a sort of togetherness with the other diners that I wouldn't have thought that I would enjoy but I did. There was a lot of chatter and laughing in the dining area but how could that possibly be a bad thing? I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely. Something for everyone, and a unique place for Phoenix . I won't debate how it compares to chicken & waffles places in the South or in L.A., all I can say is that every meal I've had here has been terrific. Fried chicken is the perfect balance of crispy and juicy.  The cinnamon-y (is that a word?) waffles are tender and melt in your mouth. A nice splash of maple syrup and there's no need for the ice-cream-sized scoop[ of butter sitting on top.  Cornbread and sweet potatoes are also good. I'm not a fan of greens, okra or mac & cheese, but my family and friends vouch for their excellence. Service is always friendly. So, so good."}
{"text":"Love love love Lo Lo's chicken and waffles. I've been here multiple times and it's great every time. You know a place is gonna be great when a place has kool aid especially when you can mix it with lemonade."}
{"text":"I notice such wonderful reviews so I had to go and try it .  But as usual I was disappointed .  I think mainly because people from Arizona don't understand what food is suppose to taste like .  Being from the northeast Where restaurant's are extremely competitive and mediocre food will kill you faster than a bullet .  Here are some good points The chicken was well cooked and was juicy .  But it was under seasoned and very bland .  The waffles were way too sweet and they were soggy.The place has the potential but the execution wasn't very good .  You could probably get just as good at I hop .  It seems in Arizona people will go out and eat anything and accept it . There are no standards"}
{"text":"If a half star could be given I would in the case of Lo Lo's Chicken and Waffles. 

I had heard about this place from someone at work who said he went there every Sunday after church. I was a little skeptical, but really wanted to try it. A date was set with a few of us from work and I couldn't wait. Sadly it was cancelled. Brad was sad :( But then Dallas G suggests we go there that same Friday night after a bunch of drinks. So Saturday morning I made the long trek from Cave Creek to downtown. 

When I arrived I was a little worried about my car, but figured it's not worth anything anymore anyway. I only had to wait about 5 minutes as my 3 friends were already waiting for a bit. I had studied the menu online a couple of days prior and already knew what I wanted. So I got my Betty Boop, mac and cheese, and lemonade in the mason jar. My good buddy Z laughed at me a little for ordering the Betty Boop. 

So the fried chicken breast, waffle, with the ice cream sized scoop of butter on it, come out, along with the mac & cheese. Needless to say the food was awesome! The waffle was buttery, a little cinnamony, and delicious. The chicken breast was good, a little dry, but I had no problem cleaning all the meat off. The mac & cheese was good too. The best part was when the bits of fried batter would fall off into some syrup. This is a dish unto itself. The salty and sweet were awesome. Reminded me of bacon and syrup. 

Prices weren't high at all. Great place for some next day drinking recovery. I have been raving about it to all of my friends since. In fact, I think we will be going this Saturday."}
{"text":"We checked out Lo Lo's Chicken and Waffles on Father's Day (downtown location).  All I can say is YUMMY!!!  And I am so happy we went.  They were pretty busy but the wait was only 20 minutes.  

We loved the atmosphere when we walked in and the staff very personable.   The red Kool-Aid was perfect on this hot summer day!

What we had:
Chicken and Waffles and Chicken and French Fries

We had to have the red velvet cake which all three of us loved!  And it was a nice treat.

Will go back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a final \"farewell to Phoenix\" lunch with 10 of us. It was hot outside and the wait was an excruciating hour. What was nice was they had coolers of drink for the people waiting. Once we were finally sat, the service was fast and friendly. I ordered Kool Aid since well.. everyone else did. When I received it I remember why I dont drink it...its too damn sweet! Ick.Anyway I ordered the Tre Tre and i was freakin delicious and the perfect amount of food. I could not have been happier to have this as my final meal in Phoenix. I definitely recommend this place, just be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"This place was great. Parking not so much, but it's nice they have a free valet parking service. Came here for lunch and we were seated almost immediately (the spring training game was still playing, but from what we heard the place gets nuts at other times). I ordered some blue Kool-Aid and Lo-Lo's which is two chicken and two waffles. Out waiter was nice he wasn't the most personable, but he was hustling so many tables I didn't mind I was in good company regardless. The Kool-Aid was so so so good! I haven't had Kool-Aid this good in a long time. It was a hot day and it literally hit the spot. The chicken was good and the waffles were nice and fluffy. I've had chicken and waffles before and I'll admit this isn't the best chicken and waffles I've ever had (that award is still Roscoes in So Cal), but man was it close! Good location and I was stuffed. I will definitely revisit this place again if I am back in this area again!"}
{"text":"We've been to Lo-Lo's a few times now with friends. We always have to wait to be seated, due to its popularity, and the service is often slow, too. The restaurant has a cool ambiance, although the music (often by a live DJ) is usually too loud for my preference. I always order a fried chicken breast with waffles. It is seriously so good. The waffles are crispy and the chicken is seasoned well and isn't greasy. The combination of the two with some maple syrup is killer. I've gotten some of the sides before (cornbread, mac'n'cheese, lemonade) and they're yummy, but they add to your bill.

Pros:
-Delicious chicken waffles.
-Local soul food.

Cons:
-Long wait to be seated. Slow service.
-Expensive for the portions.
-Loud music."}
{"text":"Food is fine.....but much better when you go to the restaurant outside of the airport. The chicken is sometimes a little burnt and they just aren't very consistent with the quality here. BUT if you get them on a good day....it's great."}
{"text":"My all time favourite place! Always good, always fast!!! Edith is the BEST server EVER!!! Don't forget the banana pudding!!!"}
{"text":"How can you ever go wrong with chicken and waffles! And don't forget that purple drank!!! The waffles at Lo-Lo's are by far my favorite waffles I have ever tasted! Mac n' cheese is dope and everything's been good! Matter of fact, I need to hit this place up again this weekend."}
{"text":"Loved the service and food at this location!  Catfish was excellent. 
Cant say the same for Scottsdale location!"}
{"text":"Visited the Scottsdale location twice and wasn't impressed either time.  So loud with people talking over the already very loud music piped throughout the restaurant that we had to ask that the music be turned way down so that Grandma with her hearing Aides could stay.  The noise was making her ill.  

The food was salty and served cold.

Horrible parking situation as well!

Wont come to this location again."}
{"text":"This was the first time coming back to this location in years! I love the comfort food here and can't get enough of it! They have remodeled and looks even better. The big pain about this location last time was the parking, but it got better because there is a lot of self parking spots and they even have a complimentary valet service! 

I chose to valet the car of course. Too lazy to walk, lol. It was steady and busy for a Sunday. The wait was about 30 minutes. Walking in though it was like a whole new atmosphere. The place was bigger than last time I seen it, so there was ample room. We got seated in the booth. I forgot who was our waiter, shame on me, but they were very pleasant and nice. We all ordered the smothered chicken and man it was DELICIOUS. It definitely hit the spot. The chicken even though it was smothered with the creamy gravy and onions still had a little crunch to it which was good still. I added some hot sauce to it and it just made this plate to die for.

Waffles were hot and fresh. Poured some syrup all over it and I couldn't ask for anything more. Finished off all of the chicken, some of the gravy even made its way onto the waffles, but that didn't even matter because whatever was on that plate was just the right kind of balance of sweet and saltiness together. It definitely made my Sunday! OVERALL, with the new look and excellent staff, I enjoyed every minute of it. I think its nice that it was a valet for its customers because of how parking is in Phoenix. Their staff is amazing. Very courteous, polite, and exceptional. The food, BEYOND AMAZING and I will make sure I come back.. maybe even this Sunday again!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, really friendly staff. We had to wait a bit but as expected for a Saturday afternoon.

Very accommodating and very friendly environment. Definitely has the same quality as the downtown Phoenix location!"}
{"text":"I love this place! When you are craving soul food and some yummy chicken and waffles this is the place! I recommend a soul platter, sides of fried okra and whipped potatoes."}
{"text":"I understand that Theres always a wait to sit down. But I am currently sitting and have been waiting for food over an hour!!! Two tables that seated after us have finished their meals and left. Not coming back to this location. Food isnt worth it at all. Waitres has checked on us maybe twice."}
{"text":"Great place to eat for soul food. Best chicken & waffles. I stick with the chicken omelette, it is the best thing. Also the chicken fried chicken is awesome."}
{"text":"Where to start. 
We've been wanting to try this place for ages. Specially since we've heard all the fuss about. Finally we were passing by and there was a parking spot, so we decided to try it. 
We got there and got sat right away. 
The lemonade was amazing! 
Then we ordered.
Our food took over an hour. The restaurant was full but it was mainly because people's food take forever! 
We were optimistic saying it would be worth it. 
Finally the chicken was average. I preferred Church's chicken however. The whip mash was good. The macaroni was good. The hot sauce was okay. The atmosphere was nice. The server was very nice and attentive. That's why I give it an average rating. 
Would I come back? 
Maybe, if I was passing by and there was a parking spot available."}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's was so good the first time I went, that I returned the next morning as soon as they opened.  It was in the old location, but I may have liked it better then!  Definitely a staple whenever I'm in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Music too loud and asked if they could turn it down......uncool! Glasses for water pretty cool. WAS THE 1st TO ORDER And the LAST TO GET FOod!!!!We think it was because we complained about the music????!! food super yummy!! chicken was to die for."}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is absolutely terrible from the valet, to the kitchen and management. 

They had 1 guy parking and retrieving cars and another just standing there doing nothing. I had to wait to enter the restaurant until the one valet guy addressed the needs of 5 people that were leaving. Really, I Have to wait to actually spend my $$$. 

We ordered an appetizer that never came and had 1 libation in 40 minutes of time at the table (the water we asked for was never brought either). 

The manager came over and asked if we wanted the appetizer. Dumb solution as a manager. Of course I don't want it now, my food is at the table after a 40 minute wait and I am eating my chicken and waffle now!!!!

Poor leadership yields poor service. This place needs help or the Business will fail. 

One of the worst experiences a paying customer can have. 

Too many other options in town to waste my time with this place."}
{"text":"Went in on a rainy Sunday around 1pm.. would've been a 45min-1hr wait for 2 people but instead found 2 seats at the bar. Ordered the lo-lo's punch & purplesaurus rex.. they did not have the correct vodka for the lo-lo's punch so the bartender made a silimar drank. He only made the punch and completely forgot about the purplesaurus rex.. he came around maybe 15 minutes later to check on us which is when we reminded him of the other drank.

The food came out at a reasonable time after placing the order. They did not give us any silverware so we asked the food runner when he brought the food and he disappeared as though he was gonna bring some, he didn't. We had to get up and walk to the opposite side of the bar to get the bartender to hand us silverware.. not cool. Since it was rainy and a bit chilly we were a bit upset that our food would get cold.

Food was good, but not impressed by the service.  Would recommend ordering & picking up the food to-go  instead of eating in."}
{"text":"The fried chicken was ok, not as good as Mrs Whites Soul Food. The service was not the best, very over rated."}
{"text":"This place is insane, great food, service was phenomenal (thanks Chris) and we need one in Seattle."}
{"text":"By far the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. The Kool-aid in a mason jar and fried pickles appetizer really made it a unique and tasty dinner."}
{"text":"My roommate & I went to Lo-Lo's on a random late Saturday morning.. and never wanted to leave. We waited about 20 minutes, the staff was great & incredibly friendly. The food.. oh the food. Frankly, we were completely useless the rest of the day after our ridiculously delicious meal.  We both agreed that they were the best waffles and the best fried chicken we had ever had, respectively. The sweet tea was so good, as well as the corn bread with real creamy butter. We had every intention of trying the red velvet cake, but it was sadly an impossibility. Next time!"}
{"text":"I discovered Lo-Lo's while on a business trip to Phoenix, and boy and I glad I did! From the moment we walked in, we were greeted warmly and sat promptly. The menu was filled with many delicious options, but ultimately I went with the Chicken Fried Chicken, mac & cheese, and collard greens. Normally, I am one who immediately reaches for salt or pepper no matter the restaurant, except here. What's more, is that I didn't even realize that fact until I was nearly halfway done with my food. 

The flavor profile of the dish was intense, I could tell I was dining on a old family recipe that had been passed down and updated over the years. The Kool-Aid was indeed large -- maybe even too large -- but very tasty. For dessert, I had the Red Velvet Cake, and that too was very scrumptious. The sponge was moist, and the frosting wasn't overbearing, but just the perfect punctuation to a well-crafted sentence.

Now, I must be honest and say that the reason I am not giving the restaurant 5 stars is because I came back for Brunch the next day -- a Sunday. I was very excited to return, mainly to have the Biscuits and Gravy, and sadly, I was underwhelmed. Not only did it take an exorbitantly long time for the food to arrive, but when it did, it appeared as if it had been sitting under heating lamps for quite some time. Not to mention, the flavor profile was not nearly as intense as my previous meal there. Might I suggest to this establishment to start taking reservations. Not just for your patrons, but also for your kitchen, so that the line can be equipped, staffed and prepared for the monstrous crowds that flock to this otherwise great restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix. Drum sticks and thighs are amazing! The kool aid is delicious"}
{"text":"I don't get this place.  Hole in the wall atmosphere is awesome, food disappoints.  Waffles tasted like frozen waffles from the grocery store and the chicken was good but not very juicy.  Prefer El Pollo Loco."}
{"text":"You wanna talk to a manager at \"LO-LO's?\" Oh well that's a NO NO. It ain't happening. The best part is when they finally sent the \"manager\" out, he was missing dignity AND a tooth. Really?! That's what you're goin with LO LO? Do NOT come here unless you want to wait 2 hours for you food and catch a cold from the tooth breeze. IAN. I'm lookin at you. WELP."}
{"text":"During a recent road trip, a chef friend sent me a link to www.roadfood.com so I could try some interesting eateries along the drive from Green Valley to Goodyear. The site suggested Lo-Lo's, and Yelpers agreed. We didn't have to make a major detour off the freeway.

We parked on the street and entered a modest restaurant with bars on the window. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=KUUUNkwR7yzcX2o38AYTQQ No biggie. We received a warm welcome and got friendly service.

We ordered:

* 2 waffles with 3 pieces of chicken - I liked the waffles a lot. I still am not sure I \"get\" chicken with waffles, but I'm testing it out. I liked the chicken, but wasn't completely blown away by it.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=3fY_2vL-zR4xXiKuhDjRgA
* 1 plain waffle for our 5-year-old - Thumbs up from the kid.
* Grits - Lumpy and plain, but still nice in a simple carb sort of way. As a California girl, I know almost nothing about grits.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=UP5-xhOoSN3C3JLURcrXJA
* Chili and corn muffin - The chili was made with beans and beef, and was delicious. The corn muffin seemed pretty dry - waffles are way better here. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=PojMqwuCAdilemZILlH1AA
* Mac n' cheese - Creamy and satisfying. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=apV6OcH9iItBhrm8An33nw
* Collard greens - Spicy, the flavor seemed a bit muddled, but it was a-okay. 
* Red velvet cake - This was one of the best RV cakes I've tried. Incredibly moist (how did they do it?), very sweet, with fresh pecans on the frosting. I recommend ordering a slice to go, since you'll likely be to full to enjoy it after eating all this heavy food. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=l12Isv2RMc5q0LRuYmD4wA

I was glad to have found this special soul food restaurant. We left feeling totally stuffed and very impressed."}
{"text":"Loved every minute of it. Amazing food. Corn bread was fantastic, chicken was crisp and juicy, waffle was amazing. Get the Mac and cheese. Great atmosphere. Get ready for a bit of a wait to be seated."}
{"text":"Been here many times.. Great place to bring out of towners..I've never had anything bad here, love the fried chicken and waffles, fried catfish is out of this world and the shrimp and grits are amazing. I usually like going to the original location near downtown Phoenix for charm even tho it's in a barrio and industrial area. Service is always prompt, one of my favorite valley restaurants."}
{"text":"I'd like to think of myself as a chicken and waffle enthusiast. We arrived at this location at about 11:45 on a Sunday morning. We were told the wait would be 45 minutes for 2 people. It's usually impossible to get my boyfriend to wait to be seated for anything longer than 15 minutes. I insisted, however, as I had heard so many wonderful things about this establishment. 

This place was very clean and had a very nice \"homey\" vibe about it. My water came in a mason jar, which was a nice touch. 

In true fashion, I ordered a chicken and waffle plate. The chicken was phenomenal. Crunchy and very flavorful. The waffle was fluffy, buttery and creamy. No complaints here about the chicken and waffles. 

My boyfriend, however, had the catfish plate. The sides were bland, corn bread dry and catfish average at best. 

So, for what this places is known for, chicken and waffles, way to go! Not so much for their fish and side dishes. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"My husband took my kids and myself out for dinner. We got there around 6:45 we placed our order a few minutes later and waited over and hour and still hadn't been served. My kids were loaded on kool aid. And kept asking for their food. My husband noticed people around us, who ordered after us were being served so he had asked our waiter for an ETA and he just kept saying it's coming and still nothing. It was getting late so we ended up leaving my kids were upset. This was our first time here and it was not a good experience. Won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"We finally got a chance to stop in and try the place out. Being from Los Angeles, we often went to Roscoe's... so when we got the craving for chicken & waffles, I was excited to see a reputable place was out here in the valley. I was definitely NOT disappointed. The chicken was fantastic, as was the waffles!  The chicken tenders were not nearly as good as the regular fried chicken, but they too were still good. Additionally, the cornbread muffins were large and quite delicious. I am absolutely thrilled to know this place here, we will be coming back often, that's for sure! Its also good to know they have multiple locations, making it easier when in other areas. If you are in the area and craving some delicious food, so in and check it out. Great food and a friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I usually arrive in Scottsdale around 4 pm, get some groceries, check into the hotel and the go find the perfect ribeye.    Today my plane landed at 1:15, so went went to lunch instead.   I'm always looking for good fried chicken and found Lo-Lo's on some searches.

Arrived around 2.   Parking was everywhere, so I parked right up front.  The hostess seated us promptly, and our waiter took our drink orders...two iced teas.

On the flight over we were talking about chicken gizzards which got me hungry for them.  I didn't see a appetizer order of gizzards on the menu, but I asked the server and in no time at all, the gizzards arrived.  They were very tender and had a good flavor.  Five Stars for the Gizzards.

We had to decided if we were going to go out rib eye hunting in the evening yet, so I ordered the small order of chicken and waffles.  My friend ordered chicken and gravy and waffles. 

By the time we finished off the gizzards our meal came.   Mine looked and tasted delicious.   The waffles were so light and fluffy and would love to come back just for them.  Chicken was good too.  Five stars for that!

My friend said he hadn't had chicken and gravy since he lived in the south, and it said it was just as good, or even better.

The whole time service was EXCELLENT!  Five stars for that.

Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"I always order the Stupid Fries when I go to Lo-Lo's, I love the flavors and I still get that bit of chicken, and let's be honest, it has such a fun name...you'd be stupid not to try them! There's something for the entire family at this place and it's tons of fun. My hubby always gets a \"jar of drank\" (blue kool aid on tap) and my little one loves the sweet waffles! On to one of my FAVVVV things about this place...the BANANA PUDDIN'...guys, I don't even like Banana pudding or any pudding for that matter but I love theirs!!! Idk what it is but it's uuuuuhmazing! Don't skip dessert!"}
{"text":"The reason for living!!! Omg!! Comfort food to the finest!! And where else would you be able to find kool aid!! Food is so worth the wait. Hot and fresh!! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love Lo-Lo's! Been eating here for a while. Started back in the day when they were out of that rickety shack. Out of the 3 locations, this one is by far the best food and service wise. Is it just me or do the other 2 locations seem to have employees that are a little snotty....? Oh well, pound down some chicken and waffles or go with my FAV the Phatt azz chicken sammich. They always have Kool-Aid on tap too. Just found out you can get it with catfish instead of chicken. Hmmmm maybe next time!"}
{"text":"First off I just wanted to say the idea of chicken and waffles if foreign to me. This was a nice experience. My belly was happy and so were my families. Will go again."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, it's great food and great customer service. I am big on customer service! It keeps me coming back. But who can resist the  tasty fried chicken and those waffles. I get them every time and every time I'm glad I went."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here a few days ago. I had the Toy Toy which was was 3 chicken wings with waffles. My husband had the Lil Amadi which was two thighs and a waffle. The chicken was hot and crunchy....straight out of the grease. We arrived not long before closing and we didn't feel rushed at all. Great atmosphere. Our waiter was great. We enjoyed our food."}
{"text":"Great service! Our waiter was fun and had a great passion for the menu. Definitely added to the experience. When I was a kid I went to Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe all the time. I loved seeing a menu item in her name. Chicken was crispy, moist and delicious. Waffles were very good. I was about to drink the syrup. I also had a mojito which was good, not too sweet.

Wednesday night, no wait."}
{"text":"So I said to my friend I want to eat healthy , so we're on our way to sushi and we pass this joint , we immediately u turn and say we're just gonna look, 2 min later were ordering the lo lo special and the kk's dish

Not too long after the food came right out I took a bite at the food in it was so tasty, the chicken was nice and big, collar greens n mac n cheese was perfect , I knew all of this was bad for me but I couldn't help eating bite after bite. With each bite I felt so bad... but so good 

15 min later along with a 5 pound food baby I waddled my ass out of this place , lo lo's has satisfied my hunger , and my bowels will thank me later"}
{"text":"I took a bunch of my daughter's friends from college here for breakfast and it was delicious and so reasonably priced.  Some of the girls had never had chicken and waffles but they all gamefully tried it and loved it.  I had the two thighs with waffles and a side of grits.  Great portion sizes, perfectly fried chicken and homey waffles were all wonderful.  The grits were amazing - as good as I've had in the south - so cheesy and creamy.  I'd highly recommend any of their locations."}
{"text":"Only thing keeping this place from 5 stars is a few nitpicks about my meal.  It was good though and I will go again.  But read on.

*Service:  TOP NOTCH!!  From the moment I walked in the door the girl that noticed me walk in jumped up and came on over..gave me a couple options of where I wanted to sit, I chose to sit at the \"bar.\"  They set me up with a tasty sweet tea right away.  Delicious it was.  My waitress was attentively awaiting my order, but in no way pushy.  She was busy at the time I closed my menu, but someone else was right there and asked me if they could start something cooking for me.  By all means they could.  She came back...told her someone had already started it and what I ordered.  Food came out and all was well.

*Food:  Good, plenty, and quality.  I had a pretty good plate of food in front of me for $8 (of course, not counting drink or tip).  Chicken seasoning/batter was quite tasty.  My only nit here is that the chicken was a little dry.  It did fall off the bone...but was just a little dry.  The sweet tea and excess syrup on the plate were excellent for addressing this issue though.  Plus, some chicken and waffle bites together was actually not bad.  The waffle itself was quite fluffy and quality made.  My only nitpick with the waffle is aside from the butter provided, the waffle itself had a very buttery flavor to it.  There was nothing wrong with it...just wasn't quite expecting it...and it didn't seem that the syrup was very sweet...so it just tasted very buttery (if I'd realized that, I probably would not have used the whole dollop of butter that was there).  BUT...it was a quality meal and tasty.  I will visit again.

Conclusions:  As I was finishing up, I was offered more sweet tea by my very attentive but not annoying or pushy waitress.  I had her give me half a glass.  As I was putting the bill together, a guy behind the counter (manager perhaps?) offered to fill it up before I left.  I declined...but I must say...I really, really enjoyed the customer attention and service.  So many places lack this.  It was a delight and a pleasure to patronize LoLo's Chicken and Waffles."}
{"text":"I came in here on a friday night late. There was a few people eating and they had a DJ. This was my second time here. I ordered the 3 piece chicken and two sides, cornbread for $14, and paid $2 to upgrade to two chicken breasts. I placed my order and was excited to have some good fried chicken. The waitress left and 3 mins later she set my meal on the table. This did not make me happy, I wanted to wait, 10, 20, even up to 30 mins for my fried chicken. Not 3 mins, because I knew the chicken would not be fresh out of the fryer, and it wasn't. It was old, not juicy, and almost cold. I was like Im never coming back to this place. I ate the entire meal, because I was paying $16 dollars for it. The side items, collard greens and Mac and cheese were very good. The cornbread was excellent. The manager walked by me several times, but never asked how my meal was. 

So I paid my $24, with tax and tip and Grape Kool aid and left, never to return. Lo Lo's you can't charge $16 for chicken that has been sitting around and expect your customers to come back."}
{"text":"I love LoLo's! One of my favorite place in the PHX area!"}
{"text":"One star this time. I'm not sure what it is about this place. Some waiters are amazing and some are just idk. First I called and was told there was a 30 min wait. We went down there to put our names on the list and they said no wait. Then we ordered Cat Fish Appetizer and it was brown and grey and tasted disgusting. We told the waitress and she starts breaking apart the fish like we were lying or something. Our food took an hour to come out and was OKAY. Best part was the kool aid"}
{"text":"YES!!! I'm from L.A. so when I find a place that has \"Roscoe's Chicken and waffles\" and gets it right. I have to acknowledge it! Everything is perfect, the decor, service, wait staff, (Angel is the best server!) the kool aid and the food!! A+++++. loved it!"}
{"text":"they gave me dry chicken and they can't make  kool-aid. I only give it 2 stars because they made good friend okra."}
{"text":"We had an awful experience there this afternoon. We arrived around 1:20 PM and I checked in, giving the hostess my name and number. We were told the wait would be 45 minutes. We sat down right by the hostess. People came in and checked in while we waited. After awhile, I noticed that people arriving after us were being seated. I went up to the hostess station and inquired as to why? The woman I gave my name and number to said we weren't on the list at all. She did not know why. She also didn't seem to care. A table was cleared and we were seated. It was now about an hour after we arrived. We had looked at the menu while waiting for a table so when a waitress arrived we ordered. We both ordered 3 pcs fried chicken with two sides.  A waiter came over with waffles and two pieces of chicken and started to place it on the table in front of my wife. It came with syrup which dripped down his arm and onto the table and also on my wife. We told him it wasn't ours and he said he would clean up the syrup. He left to find out where it belonged. After he cleaned that up another waitress came to our table with catfish. We also told her that it wasn't what we ordered. My wife's plate arrived with so much melted butter on the plate I had to ask the waitress for a clean plate to transfer her food. My food was OK. I got the strong sense that everyone we dealt with was indifferent. We got our check at 3:37. While we were waiting for that the man at the next table was speaking with either the manager or the assistant manager after complaining to his waiter and being unhappy with the answer the waiter relayed to him. We have eaten at this place when it was still near Albertson's. All things considered, it wasn't worth the wait."}
{"text":"I have had this spot on my list to hit for over a year. My friend came into town from the Bay and I snagged her as my LoLo's date. 

We hit the place for a late breakfast on a Sunday. When we entered, we were greeted like family. The service was personal and quick. I ate every bit of my two piece and waffle. My sweet tea was served in a big mason jar and it was perfect. When we left, I felt like family. Many thank yous and good byes from the owner and crew. 

I am offically addicted! I am hoping now that my out of town date is gone, I can find someone else to soak up this amazing place."}
{"text":"Another amazing location for this chain. This location has a different inside feel than the Phoenix one, but the food and service is classic Lo-Lo's. We have been here a couple of times, and it is always packed to the brim. The seating can be a touch tight given the layout, so you may get friendly with a neighboring table.

There may be a bit of a wait as well here since it's a local hit. We haven't waited more than about 10 min at most, but it's just the two of us. The chicken is always cooked perfectly with a crunchy outer coating that complements the chicken, without taking away from the great flavor of the chicken itself. The waffles are light and fluffy and the sweetness is just right.

The banana pudding in a mason jar is a must-have for dessert here, so SAVE ROOM! Make it happen.

Overall: A+
Another win and fingers crossed that they come to Cali so we can continue to enjoy them!!!"}
{"text":"Having been a bookmark on my Yelp account for some time now, we finally got the chance to try this place out! We headed in and were greeted right away. We didn't have a reservation, but we lucked out and got there earlier than the rush, so we were seated in a nice booth up front.  The place filled up pretty quickly after we arrived, so I would recommend calling ahead if you have a larger party (and they only seat your party once everyone has arrived, so keep that in mind, too).

Our waitress was Leslie and she was wonderful from the very start.  Friendly and accommodating she allowed us a bit of time to look over the menu and made recommendations based on our preferences, which worked out nicely.  I had the Lo-Lo's meal and he had the Double D meal, we shared an order of cornbread, cause...who turns down southern style cornbread?? We opted to try out a couple of their drinks which I cannot remember the names of, but they were good! 

The meals came out quickly an were exactly the way we ordered them and they smelled amazing. Chicken was cooked nicely and the breading was really well seasoned. Waffles were fluffy and perfect. The cornbread was gone within seconds of hitting the table. 

Despite being way too full for it, we shared a banana pudding for a dessert, which was worth every agonizingly over full bite! I highly recommend this if you from the south and like a good banana pudding with real slices of banana and wafer topping!

Overall: A+
Great service, great southern food with hilarious names (amazing dessert for a bonus), and fun ambiance make this place a \"will absolutely return\" venue!"}
{"text":"My second time here after so many years! Still da best chicken and waffles - corn bread is amazing forget about carbs this is soooo worth it!"}
{"text":"This isn't the best chicken and waffles I've had but it's pretty good. 

I've been twice and both times have gotten the 2 pieces of chicken with waffles. It's pretty cheap, the waffles are thin and sweet, and the chicken has been fresh both times I've been here. The corn muffins are definitely a must add on.

As a mac and cheese connoisseur I thought that a $4 side of mac and cheese was going to be AMAZING but instead it was the only thing that I didn't like about our meal - one reviewer mentioned that it was like Kraft but Kraft is honestly better. This was very bland and a tiny portion (again considering the hefty price tag).

I haven't tried the drank but I've heard it's delicious from multiple people so you should try it if you're a Kool-Aid fan."}
{"text":"Hands down the best fried chicken, waffle, mac and cheese I've ever eaten. Completely exceeds whatever hype it has. I will definitely be back. Lolo's keep keeping on."}
{"text":"Food here is always good but the wait is ridiculously long no matter what time of day you arrive. Food takes a while and is way over priced!"}
{"text":"Yes to it all. The food was the best we had while visiting Phoenix and the server was full of great suggestions. So so so so so good"}
{"text":"My family and I had a late lunch here today it was terrific. The wait time was not that bad and the sweet tea was the best. If you go please get the banana pudding you love it!"}
{"text":"Average at best. Being from Memphis, I might have had unrealistic expectations. I thought it was all pretty basic and dull. I don't want to HAVE to soak it in Tabasco to taste it. If you want some fried chicken with a waffle on the side, go for it. If you want \"chicken & waffles\" go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Oh Lo-Lo's I love you so. When I am in need of some comfort food and kool-aid I come to you.

The chicken is off the chain and the mac and cheese hits that special love spot of your belly. You never leave hungry and usually have a to go bag in your hands.

I would love to give you a 5 star rating, but the thing that brings it down, is that in the number of times I have eaten at Lo-Lo's the costumer service has been lacking. It felt as if we were cutting into someones day, and you couldn't wait for us to leave. I have asked for more water, a straw, etc and the servers seem put out by it.  It is also very muggy and hot in there every time I have been there. If you can get across to the staff that customers are what also drives a business, not just the food, that would be awesome."}
{"text":"Okay, so I like fried chicken but I'm not the biggest fan, especially the sloppy greasy kind of fried chicken. I haven't been to KFC, Popeyes or Church's Chicken in years and my friend had been suggesting this place since I moved to Phoenix over 4 years ago. Let me just say, I can't believe it took me 4 years to come here, no seriously, I have to slap myself silly for that because LoLo's has renewed my faith in fried chicken. Seriously, I think that was the best fried chicken I've had in my life. The chicken was fried to a perfection, nice golden crisp with minimal grease, that's right, MINIMAL grease! I didn't think that was physically possible for fried chicken but LoLo's debunked that myth! I have the #7, which was 3 chicken wings and a waffle. I've already swooned over the fried chicken, now the waffle was ok, nothing too special, same stuff you get at a waffle house. I still can't get over the friend chicken though.....Anyways, I really liked the atmosphere here, on the south end of downtown, this place gets crazy packed for lunch. A lot of regulars come here and it's obvious from the waiters and waitresses hootin and hollering at the customers when they come in by their first names, kind of cool! Anyways, I will be back for more fried chicken for sure and am curious to try their cat fish!"}
{"text":"When my sister comes to AZ from
Cali to visit, we come to Lo-Lo's at least 3x within a week. We love \"George on yo Mind\" that's a drank and the music selection is always jamming. Service is always good & the food is da bomb.com"}
{"text":"Excellent waffles. Dreamy chicken. Horrible service and with a $3.50 soda I expected a refill I never got. :-(  my lunch came to $17 (i got the lolos and a soda) so it was kind of expensive overall  but because the food was stellar I gave it 4 stars and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Stopped here tonight for dinner and waited about 20 minutes for a table of 3. The food took around 35-40 minutes to come to the table... The server dropped off the plates for both people in my party and walked away without saying anything. So then I had to wait a few minutes for my food to come. Overall, the food was pretty good and had large portions, but the service was not the best. The server wasn't even around most of the time and when we did need something, she dragged around slowly to get it for us. What really irritated me is that she offered us refills for our kool aid, but never mentioned that it was gonna be an extra $3.50 for a refill per person. Honestly don't think I'll be back to this place unless I just get a to go order."}
{"text":"SLOW service and not worth the long wait. The chicken is average and very salty. Culinary Dropout's fried chicken is better. Infact, KFC chicken is better than this joint."}
{"text":"The chicken is really good and so are waffles. That was all I had but my husband had the Kool-Aid as well which I guess was super sweet. I guess that Kool-Aid will take you back to your childhood days.  The prices are a little expensive but it's not too bad we just don't eat here that often."}
{"text":"fried chicken.
waffles.
kool aid.

what else are you waiting for? Go! Now!"}
{"text":"chicken!
waffles!
kool aid!

why aren't you eating at lolo's yet?"}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's is a No-No! 

I read all these great reviews, my mouth was watering and saved my appetite.  I was REALLY disappointed.  We arrived there at 12:00pm on a Tuesday afternoon.

Items we ordered

*2 chicken wings w/waffle
*2 drumsticks w/red beans and rice
*fried okra
*greens
*red velvet cake
*1/2 tea and 1/2 sweet tea

Oh the chicken.....................not crispy and NO flavor!!  Like another reviewer said, \"my mom makes better fried chicken\"  - I couldn't agree with her more!  I was thinking about Popeye's chicken while eating this one.  Missing the crispiness and flavors.

The waffle was very good.  Had a hint of cinnamon.

Red beans and rice tasted like it someone opened a can of baked or chili beans and poured it over rice.  Popeye has won over this one too.

Thank goodness for the greens!!  They were tender and DELISH!!!!  But is it worth driving there to get greens.... i dunno...

The coating on the fried okra was hard.

Oh Noooo..... the red velvet cake was the WORST!!!  If there is Red Velvet cake at an establishment, I'll always try it.  I was sooooo disappointed with this one. I only took two bites and had to push it away.  It was too dense and it tasted like there was tons of oil in it.  The cake didn't have flavor, just red.  The frosting was waaay too sweet.  Try Tammie Coe's instead.   

I grew up on Southern food and this place was not tasty at all. 

The service was friendly, but slow.

One star is for the greens 
One star for the waffle"}
{"text":"It had been years since I visited Lo-Lo's, so a few friends and I decided to go last night. 

I had no idea they had moved from the tiny house that Lo-Lo's started in to the huge modern new location (still on Central and Yuma) just South of downtown Phoenix. Very impressive building that can accommodate many many more people than before. It's still packed like it always was but you can check in online using Yelp!  It will tell you your time window and when to arrive at the restaurant. Very cool!

Food is sooooo good. I had a three piece chicken platter and got mac n cheese and collard greens as my two sides. The hardest decision is what sides to
pick. They have many and they all sound really good! It also came with corn bread. Best corn bread I have ever had. The platter is so huge, I only ate one piece of chicken and took the rest home. 

They do have alcohol now, but I ordered sweet iced tea (best in town). 

I was way too stuffed to order dessert, but they looked really good. Perhaps I will order dessert first next time! 

If you are in the mood for some soul food, be sure to go to Lo-Lo's!  Don't forget to check in online through Yelp. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Lolo's is by far the best fried chicken west of the Mississippi, and maybe even east of it! (And I was raised in the south so I know good fried chicken.) Everything else there is delish too, I even enjoyed eating waffles with my chicken, something I would never have tried on my own."}
{"text":"I live in Cali so my loyalty is to Roscoe's, but I must admit that Lo-Lo's is just as good.  The service was absolutly wonderful, so that made my dining experience even better.  LOVED the sweet tea - it was perfect! The greens were phenomenal and that waffle...OMG!  I can't wait to get back to Phoenix just to get another piece of the red velvet cake!"}
{"text":"This place was fabulous. The staff was funny, curteous, and prompt. Food was fantastic, and although I was too full for dessert, I took home a slice of red velvet cake. Best. Decision. Ever. The slice was huge and probably the most moist and delicious red velvet cake I've ever eaten. I will definitely be back when I visit Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets four stars is because of the wait other than that this place is ah-ma-zing. 
The chicken & waffles of course is great but the mac & cheese!!!!! Honestly the best I've ever had & I'm from Detroit so that's saying a lot. 
My boyfriend & I go here at least 3x a month!"}
{"text":"My first chicken and waffle experience. LOVE Lo-Los punch. Strong and tasty! Gotta get the chicken and waffles bro"}
{"text":"I was so hungry when I got off my plane at the Phoenix Airport that I immediately scoured the area for something to eat.  I stumbled upon this place for chicken, waffles, fried okra and sweet tea!  The chicken hit the spot and I loved the sweet tea!  The waffle was not so crispy and not too flavorful but forgivable.  The okra was not so flavorful either; it needed some dipping sauce.  Maybe that is what I was missing.  Either way, I was still pretty happy.  Either that or I was happy because I was so hungry.  I didn't have time to stop by before my return flight and I was a little sad...oh well, next time then!"}
{"text":"Recently ate at this establishment while in Arizona visiting family. This restaurant was suggested to us and we were so excited about getting some good ol Southern Food. I truly would have given 5 stars if I was basing this review on food alone. However; this review is based off our entire experience.  First let's starts with the 

Pros: the front door staff/ hostess where extremely friendly and were able to seat our party of five in a decent amount of time. The food absolutely hands down delicious. The chicken was moist and perfectly fried to perfection. My collard greens had the right amount of flavor and heat to taste. Don't get me started on the waffles omg AMAZING. I truly enjoyed my food so to the cooks GREAT JOB.

Now on to the 

Cons: our waitress Edith although friendly was not that attentive. I ordered the catfish appetizer and specifically requested it come out prior to our meal.. well that never happened because our food came out before the appetizer. I had to let her know that I no longer wanted it because it was late coming to the table. Also she rarely returned to our table after our orders came out and seemed like other waitstaff was picking up her slack. She forgot or it just took several minutes for her to bring things that our party requested back to the table. For example I order sweet tea which I didn't get until I wad half way through with my meal. Once finished we requested some Togo boxes and a bag which the boxes came out but no bag then had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the bag and check. 

After paying for our meal and getting back home I noticed I was still charged for the catfish appetizer. I called the restaurant and was told to hold while they get Edith on the phone. Once she got on the phone and I explained my calling she said to please hold while she gets the manager to adjust the charges to only be hung up on. I called back and then was reconnected to Edith and was told to hold again while charges are reversed. I waited on hold for about 10 to 15 minutes when finally was told charges had been adjusted. I am just hoping in the few business days it takes to show the reversal on my card that it actually does. 

All and all I loved the restaurant, food, and friendly atmosphere. But didn't care so much for the service received.  I would definitely recommend coming here to eat and enjoy the soulful cooking.  Just note that some staff training maybe needed."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! Soul food! I served a mission in Georgia and this restaurant brought back SO many wonderful memories.

The food was AMAZING! I've had their fried chicken (juicy yet crispy), their fried ocra, their stupid fries (\"they's stupid GOOD!\"), their macaroni and cheese (wonderful), and their waffles (so yummy!). I heartily recommend this restaurant to anyone! 

I love that the menu is written with Southern drawl and that the drinks are served in mason jars. Kool-aide on TAP?! It can't get better than that!"}
{"text":"Came in at 10pm on a Saturday night, there was 1 group in front of us and the hostess said it would be about a 10 minute wait. The busser was cleaning tables sloppily as when we were seated 20 minutes later, our seat was still wet with water spots everywhere. There were THREE tables open but no one was being seated. The line kept getting longer behind us and no where to stand.

Once we were seated our server was very friendly and consistent in checking on us. 

The food was amazing as always! You can never go wrong with their chicken and waffles. The koolaid which comes in a variety of flavors just tops it off! Highly recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd visit. Unfortunately this dinner was a waste of money. The service was slow. The floors needed a once over with a push broom. Our table and the table next to us got our food and we all had no silverware. My Chicken tasted like the grease was burnt. My husband said the gizzard were over cooked and he didn't even eat them. On an up side my yams were really good and my husband loved the fried green tomatoes. All in all it was a wasted  $40."}
{"text":"I'm glad the restaurant is doing well for their sake but it can't be because of the chicken.   I've been there three times and found the fried chicken over-cooked and therefore dry and tough.  KFC is much much better.  And some of the help or managers have a take it or leave it attitude and seem maybe unhappy about something.    I am going to give it another try and order the salmon patties and maybe the catfish....  but no more fried chicken."}
{"text":"I think if I were on death row, I would request Lolo's chicken and waffles and blue Kool aid for my last meal.

I don't come here often. But when I want to indulge in some excellent, crispy and not greasy, fried chicken and a sweet waffle, I run to Lolo's. It's so good. Be prepared to go into a food coma after your meal, so I don't recommend for a work lunch. More Sunday brunch where you can go home after and take a nap :)

Service has always been friendly and our food comes out fast.

My only gripes are that the wait is very long, which wouldn't necessarily be a problem but I feel like it's disorganized. There was a large table open for a while and we didn't understand why we weren't just seated there. The hostess was frazzled and confused.

I also think it's a bit overpriced. I wanted to try the hot wings until I saw that it was $12 for only 6! Really? That should be $7 tops.

And, I don't think the AC was working in the bathroom today. It was like walking into a sauna!

So, gripes aside, I love the food. Period. But I try not to come more than once every 3 months...I think that's how long it takes my body to digest a meal here."}
{"text":"This food is not worth the wait. I've done dine-in and carry out and it always takes 45-60 minutes to get your food regardless of how busy they are. They don't take phone orders for takeout. We walked in to place a carryout order and we were told it would take 15 mins. It took 50 mins and 4 other orders placed after us were served before we were."}
{"text":"First let me start out by saying I'm a sucker for chicken and for the most part on this they deliver. I have tried to call in an order after my wife and I are leaving the gym so that I can just duck in quick and grab my order rather than waiting around sweating all over the place. I was told I couldn't place an order without leaving a credit card and after explaining that I will not do that from a previous problem of having an employee of another business stealing my info and using it(nightmare). Said she couldn't even notify the kitchen without a credit card( Kitchen was right next to her phone station). said it would be a 10-15 minute wait if I came in and placed order and I could wait at bar. Not a good idea with how sweaty I was and my wife waiting in car. I placed order anyway and waited outside on a chilly night ---25 minutes later food showed up. got home --had ordered a whole rotisserie chicken and two large sides. got the two large sides but only half the chicken. oh well.
I have gone in 5 times now by myself and if I get there early enough they will sit me at a table. I had to go get waitress one morning in the kitchen after I waited over 15 minutes at hostess station waiting to be seated. The gentleman outside mopping or hosing the sidewalk kept motioning me to go back to kitchen to get their attention.
It was 7:10 am and it was the only time by myself I got to eat at a table. Other times, like today I walked in at 11:20. I said \"Table for one\". Reply...How about the bar? When eating Id much rather be at a table or booth. I like to order desert and coffee after my meal and be comfortable. so I said Id prefer a table or booth unless they were expecting a big rush. She said yes thanks, please have a seat at the bar( I counted once I was seated at the BAR). There were 8  tables occupied at the time out of the possible 40+ tables and booths in the place. When I left there were.....8tables occupied. This same hostess one other time approached me at the bar on another occasion that I was told by her to sit at  and said If I was parked in an unauthorized spot I would be towed away. I asked her where I was allowed to park since they share a big lot with the hotel on same property. She told me and since I had parked in an authorized area I point out my truck and she said \" Because if your towed away don't expect LoLos to pay your towing bill\". She needs to be somewhere else in this business other than greeting the cliental. Maybe she is the owner..I don't know.
I have had it with this place and will be going to Paul Martins up the road when they have their delicious once a week fried chicken. Love your food LOLOs...not your attitude. I get a table every time at Paul Martins  no matter how busy or how many people in my party"}
{"text":"5 stars for the wonderful service our waiter, Garrett, gave us. Very attentive while we were waiting for our food. Introduced us to the restaurant manager, who is very personable, you can tell that he projects his positive energy to his staff - loved hearing his success story. Definitely the servers contribute greatly to this establishment. Ours made us feel right at home. Those, he introduced us to, made us feel welcome and talked to us like we were old friends (in our case, old friends of their parents).

4 stars for the environment, it was too loud for us. Likely 5 stars for the young at heart. This place is very upbeat and busy. The bar has several sports events playing. I went on a Friday night and they had a DJ playing the top hit songs. Not a place to go for quiet conversations. There is a patio area, but not sure if that's any quieter, my husband wanted to watch the basketball game at a table vs. the bar.

3 stars for the Blackened Fish, apparently, when they say \"blackened\" it means charcoal cooked and not seasoned with pepper and other sauces. I took a bite out of it and I got a mouthfull of char-burnt fish, yuck. The menu should actually stipulate the difference and not leave it for the waiters or manager to explain. It was topped with 3 shrimp and served with rice & vegetables, which was good.
I also had the Fried Green Tomatoes and a side of 1 flapjack, it was absolutely delicious.
The chicken breast and waffle were good too.
They do have deserts there,we ordered the peach cobbler and bread pudding that had slices of banana in it. It was good.
Several menu items to choose from and I'm definitely interested in trying other foods there.

2-3 stars for the cocktails. Ordered the melon mojito, which was just a pricey order of 7-up with mint leaves and the Blue Ivy seemed like they just served Blue Kool-Aid (I had a taste of it). I'm not a big drinker & like when it's blended/mixed so well that you can't taste the alcohol but I could usually tell if there was at least something.

1 star for parking...Hard to find parking in their very small parking lot. Most if it is for the hotel guest, next door. 

It does get busy and large parties will likely have to wait. They do not take any reservations but you can order ahead for take out."}
{"text":"Have heard about Lolos for quite sometime. It is good to go early for both parking and for a place to sit & eat. We went on a Thursday noon and when we left there was a line outside waiting to get on. I had a chicken strip salad withbacon and toasted walnuts. It was fantastic. The otherthree people enjoyed their meals as much as I did mine. Tge guy waiting our ta ble was great and as he was very busy, the receptionist helped be sure our water jars were kept filled.   Look forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"Chicken and Waffles DO NOT BELONG TOGETHER. Ew.

I understand that the world probably thinks I am the scum of the earth for giving Lo-Lo's such a low rating, however, I cannot bring myself to like greasy, nasty food.

Why is the Kool-aid flavored red? Why is it not called \"Cherry\"? These are the questions that haunt my dreams. 

Not only do I hate the food here, but why is it in the middle of no where? I had so much trouble finding it.

You may be wondering why I even bothered to come here in the first place... good question. 

It is safe to assume that I will NEVER step foot in this door again."}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's your food is great, but once again the service stunk! After being seated, we waited 20 mins b4 a server came to ask us if anyone took our order? Another 15 mins to get drinks and finally, our server took our order. Again, the food is great, but the service still stinks."}
{"text":"CHICKEN AND WAFFLES!!!!! I love it.
Been here a couple of times and thought it was finally time to write a well deserved review. It can get crowded on weekend (especially Sunday after the church crowd), but it's good on weekdays. The staff is very friendly and cool. If it's your first time here, they will help you out. 

On to the food, fried chicken is fried to crispy goodness, but the meat is on the drier side. But hey I'm okay with that cuz I got hot sauce and ketchup to smother it in. Plus their side dishes (mac and cheese, beans) make it better. Now the waffles are the bomb. They are crispy, chewy, and with the syrup to die for. My friend ordered the chicken with gravy and onions and it just looked way too messy. (that might be your thang though) Overall, good food, good people, and some sweeeeeet tea!

B"}
{"text":"Great place if your looking for tender, crispy chicken and fabulous waffles. Their kool-aid is good but I recommend asking them to put water in it because their is a lot of flavoring. Their Mac and cheese is so good and I get it everytime. I definitely recommend LoLos!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOOOOOVE Lo-lo's. This is some of the best Southern style food you will find in Phoenix. I had no idea chicken and waffles were such a good combination until I went to Lo-lo's, so now my standards for chicken and waffles are really high! Haha!

Everything from the atmosphere to their coffee to the service was awesome. Minor slight was that they did not serve decaf coffee, but no big deal. I ordered a waffle with two drumsticks and both were cooked to perfection. It's a pretty good sized waffle too, and the chicken just compliments it so well. Even the syrup on the waffle was delicious. My dad ordered bacon and eggs and he said they were cooked just the way he wanted them. Only other minor slight was that the dishes are commonly served with a side of grits and you can't substitute it for fruit or a biscuit. Still, not big enough of a deal to detract from the overall experience.

The waitresses were all so nice. They came around and refilled out coffee and waters promptly, made sure the food tested well, they even put on the Steelers game on the TV that was close to our table, which we appreciated. And the cold drinks get served in Mason jars, which is so cute. I love it when restaurants do that.

It can crowded, especially during brunch/lunch hours. My family and I went when it first opened at 9 a.m. By the time we left around 10:30, there was a line out the door for lunch. If you go for lunch, get there around 10. But even if you get there late, it's definitely worth the wait. Lo-Lo's is hands down one of the best restaurants in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times, and this review is long overdue.  First, I would like to begin by saying that the outside décor and parking lot full of cars at this place are a definite indicator of the pleasant experience that you will have, once you dine here.  I believe this is a family run establishment, and most certainly feels that way, with the hospitality and generally courteous nature of the staff.  What more can I say???  The food is excellent, Great service and great prices. I was in Phoenix this week and we (the guys and myself) ate there Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday.  Great experience each time.  If you like Soul/Southern Food, this place should be on your list."}
{"text":"I wish Yelp had a \"6th\" Star to award restaurants sometimes! I would give one to Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles.... based on my dinner this past Friday night.

First off, we ended up here almost by accident. I made the drive with my wife and daughter on Friday evening from Scottsdale to downtown Phoenix to visit Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe.... only to learn they are now closing at 7PM every night! :(   They used to be open till 3am on Friday and Saturday nights.

But... they did inform us that Lo-Lo's was open and it was not too far away... so off we went. 

They place was busy... and they sat us towards the back. But the service was crazy good!!! 

You really need to spend a few good minutes acquainting yourself with the menu. I was laughing my ass off at the menu items! \"Stupid Fries\", \"Phat Azz Samich\", \"Crazy Ghetto Mess\", \"A Jar Of Drank\"! Just to name a few.

The best \"line\" of the night... my wife asks our waiter, \"How are the 'stupid fried'?\" His reply.... They're Stupid...............(long pause)..... GOOD!\" 

I stuck with the tried and true chicken and waffles. We shared at the table the candied yams, and the fried okra. Everything was amazing! It was my first time having chicken and waffles together. And it won't be my last. I ate so much I was sick for several hours afterwards, but you can't help yourself! 

Dinner on average seems to run about $13 a person.

So when you a re in the \"hood\", give Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles... you will be glad that you did!"}
{"text":"Thank God this place is not closer to our home.  That would be dangerous to our health.  Chicken is fried to perfection....crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  The same is true of the waffles.  Great food at at great price."}
{"text":"Wow. I just happened to see this place as u was strolling around the area with time to kill.

My first thought was \"oh it's a Roscoes knockoff\",,,

Wow, I was wrong. The service was perfect, the place was clean. The food was very tasty, especially the chicken. I didn't even need to add hot sauce for flavor.

The lemonade was homemade and yummy. It is served in a large mason jar. The friendly waiter offered a take out cup for what I didn't finish.

The waffle was the thin type that I prefer, like the ones my grandma used to make.

I love the menu and decor of the restaurant. The elaborate interior design makes it feel like a large chain. 

The prices are not bad either."}
{"text":"Made a visit because we saw it on tv but ended up being disappointed. The catfish was average and the Mac n cheese bland. Too scoops of butter on my mini bowl of grits wasn't needed. Drinks were good although the menu was offensive \"drank\"???? Will not visit again."}
{"text":"Lo-lo's chicken and waffles really hit my gracing spot for some southern fried chicken and heartwarming meal. I love so many options that you can choose from their menu so practically you can mix and match to whatever you want, fried chicken leg, thigh, breast, or even fried catfish. Also, you can pick many sides from their long list of sides. I had their fried chicken legs and thigh and thought they were well seasoned although I wish they could fry it fresh. My pieces of chicken felt slightly room temperature and maybe they were left out for a while. However, they were still very tasty. Their sides were great too. Definitely try as many of them as possible! I really had a great meal there as I was really craving for fried chicken and southern meals!! The service was great too that really presents southern style of restaurants. Come out and try some authentic southern fried chicken!"}
{"text":"As you can see I'm giving this place 5 stars even though the parking situation sucks. Like it's almost laughable I don't know if Lo Los and the hotel next door got some issues they need to work out but how is almost every parking spot other than the valet(ha you thought I was gonna pay a valet bruh...sike) says hotel parking. You wanna pay for the valet go ahead but if not you better park across the street. Off the soapbox the food is so damn good. I got the chicken gizzards as an appetizer and they were excellent. They fry them perfectly and I mean perfectly because a lot of places fry them to long and they can be tough to eat. They are the best gizzards I have ever had at a restaurant. For the main course I had the Lo Los special which is a 3 piece and two waffles. The chicken is SOO crispy, and flavorful once again fried to perfection and you can taste the seasoning in every crispy bite. Next the waffle, I really didn't expect much from the waffles but that was the biggest surprise of the whole meal. They sneak nutmeg and cinnamon in the waffle mix and you catch a hint of it with every bite. It gives it a much fuller taste than a regular waffle. The combination along with their chicken is amazing. I don't care that the parking situation here blows like category 5 hurricane winds the food is A1 and I'll be back to explore the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This is always our last stop on the way to the airport when we leave Phoenix. We always get chicken and waffles but we see the other stuff that comes out and it always looks so good. The chicken is great. The waffles are great. I just love it all."}
{"text":"We read all about Lolo's on the reviews.  It's in a sketch area,  but it seems fine during the day.  We were promptly seated  and asked what we would like to drink.  I ordered the lemonade and my other the sweet tea.  The Lemonade was one of the best lemonade's I've ever had.   The Sweet tea was exactly that too sweet.

For entrée's, I ordered one leg/thiegh with a waffle.  She ordered 2 drumsticks with mac and cheese.  The fried chicken was a bit on the smaller side than I'm used to.  If you're hungry, I recommend ordering 3 piece meal.  For dessert, we ordered the red velvet cake.   Overall, the fried chicken was good but we've had better in Texas and California.  The red velvet cake was delicious, very moist.  And the Lemonade was great!

The service is good as my lemonade was never empty.   I'm not sure if we would come back to Lolo's but it was A - OK!"}
{"text":"I've had fried chicken.
I've had waffles.
Who knew that they were really meant to be Together, on the Same Plate!?  Not me, at least until I was introduced to Lo-Lo's.  

The Pilgrimage to this wee building on a small side street in downtown PHX was made on a cold, rainy Sunday - perfect weather for comfort food! 

After strategic review of the menu consisting of a price volume mix analysis to determine the right combination of entrees and side items to reach Pareto Optimality, my friend and I ended up with a table full of goodness:
Lo-Lo plate (2 waffles + 3 chicken breasts), 1 additional waffle, home fries and (no surprise here) mac n cheese.  

The food arrived quickly (benefit of arriving right at opening time!), and this is where all conversation stopped.  No talking, just eating and lots of it.  I surfaced for air once or twice to mumble random things about how good everything was, but that's about it.  I don't know how the Lo-Lo's Chicken Magicians manage to make fried chicken that is not greasy - it is crispy on the outside but still tender and juicy on the inside.  The waffles taste slightly of cinnamon and I am not ashamed that I used the entire portion of butter that was riding on the top.  All of it.  Hard arteries are strong arteries, right?  

Halfway through the mac n cheese I noticed the Red Rooster Louisiana Hot Sauce on the table - liquid fire!  Had to douse the remaining portion and feel the burn...  Yeah!!

OK Phoenix, I get it.  I know now what I have been missing all this time.  I will be back in about 4 months, when my cholesterol levels return to normal...  :)"}
{"text":"Place is good, but could be better. It looks as if a corporation has taken over with their recent expansion and remodeling, including an opening at sky harbor.  The wait is crazy now, and the side dish portions have shrunken in size but not price. $3.50 for a half cup of green beans and $4.00 for one skinny waffle seems a bit much, but hey, people are coming in droves and paying, so I guess the price is right until a competitor steps up."}
{"text":"Franchising of this place made the quality go down, and prices go up. It takes too long to get food on a Sunday also, thief ought to plan better or something."}
{"text":"If I could give them a ZERO I would .. What establishment tells you they are not taking to-go orders ? POOR Management and I will NEVER return ."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Ambiance is super cool. Kool aid is sweet. The service is hit or miss. Not a fan of the chairs if I'm not lucky enough to get a booth. I'll always go back because the pros certainly outweigh the bad."}
{"text":"Great place!I'm 6'0, 215lbs and the plate that I got was too much for me to finish and I was starving.

The waitress was very nice as well. No matter what you order to drink it'll come in a Mason jar.

The food was great and the chicken was not greasy at all. The cool thing is they leave you alone enough to eat and enjoy your food without ignoring you, great balance in customer service.

The only bad thing is I have to drive all the way to Scottsdale from my home in Chandler!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat, but for me it was too much food on one plate you can definitely share your meal with someone! The Kool-Aid in a Mason jar was a nice touch, Kool-Aid was perfect not too sweet! Family friendly all the way! The only thing I didn't like was the waiting for the table! It took way to long!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Enjoyed the experience. Anyone in AZ that come to CA needs to try Roscoes Chicken N Waffles. They are hands down the best. Nothing compares."}
{"text":"My family loves this spot. We save it for a treat day! They have the best fried chicken and their sides are amazing. Chicken and waffles for the win! Finger licking good! You can't forget their yummy lemonade either."}
{"text":"The Best chicken and waffles that ever had... so yummy, crispy..  plus they own hot sauce brand.. spice and unique flavor.. u can even buy they sauce to go... The service is great, friendly, respectful. For sure if I ever come back to Phoenix I will back to Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles."}
{"text":"The first place in two weeks where I've felt welcome in Phoenix! 

My boyfriend finally came to visit, and after my two trying weeks of lectures and starting student-teaching, I wanted a treat, even though I had just caught a cold from one of my students. We had been back-and-forth yelping, and Lo-Lo's was something we knew we definitely had to try.... but we had no idea how to get there from ASU in Tempe. After trying for half an hour to use the Valley Metro Trip Planner (which gets a NEGATIVE 4 stars for being completely unintuitive and impossible!), we called Lo-Lo's and were immediately giving light rail and bus directions. 

After probably an hour and a half, during which we are getting hungrier and hungrier, and all our conversation is redirecting to fried chicken, we walk in the door and are immediately welcomed and told to sit whereever we like. We grab a table, and are offered drinks. I got a re-fillable jar of some of the best sweet tea I've ever had (although walking three blocks in 100 degree weather may have biased that opinion sometime), and we also got two ice waters to rehydrate. We looked at the menu and immediately knew what we wanted. I ordered the soul food platter, 3 pieces of fried chicken, cornbread, and sides of mac n'cheese and collard greens. Daniel ordered the Lil' Amadi, which was 1 leg and 1 thigh with a waffle, and a side of red beans (no rice). 

Okay. So. I don't like waffles. I'm used the Belgian waffles, which are way too huge and fill me up with bread taste and make me feel bloated. Lo-Lo's waffle blew me away; it literally was like buttery, slightly mealy, air. I kept stealing bites until I basically ate the whole thing, drenched in maple syrup and fluffy whipped butter. The red beans and collard greens were incredible! We both agreed that they were our favorites of the whole meal (two former vegans... haha): the beans had a touch of sweetness, simultaneously savory and tender. The collards had basically no bitterness at all, but weren't super salty. They were tender and cut into small slices that perfectly combined into a side-appropritate mouthfull. The mac n'cheese was pretty good but I didn't really focus on its taste. The chicken! Oh my god. I've never had breast meat that was still juicy. Incredible texture, the tenderness of the meat and the crispness of the skin juxtaposed. This place definitely blows Roscoe's out, and as a native LA-er, I'm sorry to say it. 

The price is really great, less than 30 altogether, and we left a large tip because the service was so great! We felt so welcomed by the staff, and we could tell that they were having a chill time as well, singing along to Justin Timberlake in the next room. The only downside (not on their end) was that because of my slight cold, I couldn't taste all the flavors as well as I could have otherwise; that's the only reason this isn't getting a 5, and I can see myself changing that... I also cursed myself for forgetting my camera. I guess that means that I'll have to make another trip out there before I'm out of this desert."}
{"text":"I still love Lo-lo's after all this time. The parking is terrible! Let's get that out of the way as there is no way around it. The nearby hotel takes up all of the parking. 
The good gets my 5 star review! We love the chicken and waffles here! The chicken is always perfectly cooked and the waffles light and fluffy. 
The prices are reasonable and even thinking about it can make my mouth water. 
I'm not a chicken and waffles kind of gal but when I want the best I come to Lo-lo's.
They offer breakfast, lunch and dinner. Even the side dishes are homemade and the staff friendly and attentive. Go at \"offpeak\" times would be my biggest tip!"}
{"text":"Great food! I would have given a 5 stars but the table, chairs, bathroom and one of our cool aid mugs was dirty. I will still come to this place though."}
{"text":"If this place came to California.... Roscoes would go out of business!!!! EVERYTHING was good."}
{"text":"Friends took me last night and we waited about 15 minutes even though we were told 30 minutes. Everyone was so nice especially our waitress. Dj was playing music which I enjoyed, but not too loud that you cannot here your conversation. Games on TV for those keeping eye on scores. 
Food:  We ordered fried green tomatoes, fried chicken, waffles, salmon patties, collards, green beans and cornbread.  Everything was hot and delicious along with a melon margarita.
Thanks to my friends for introducing me to Lo Lo's I will be back soon."}
{"text":"I've lived in Florida 35 years and you would think that somewhere along the way I would've eaten chicken and waffles. But I've never been much of a meat eater so I didn't eat if off the bone and have never thought to order it before. But coming to Phoenix this time my husband was craving his favorite lunch. He hadn't been here since the restaurant operated in the little house out back and he was a bit apprehensive that the food wouldn't be as good. He's was very happy that it was as delicious as he remembered. 
The new restaurant is adorable. Very quaint with the rustic touches and decor but modern at the same time since it's relatively newly remodeled. 
Trace got his traditional chicken and waffles. And I got the boneless version. The chicken was succulent with a tasty crispy fried crust, not greasy. The waffle was delicious with butter and a great syrup which soaked in. Portion size was generous with a good price. I had to use skill to eat it all, because my mouth most definitely wanted to. And who can forget the sweet tea, served in a mason jar. Our waiter Jessie was super friendly and very good as his job keeping our glasses full. 
It's now one of my favorite places too."}
{"text":"Well I had not tried their famous chicken and waffles as I intended because when I entered the place, I saw that someone had ordered a plate of chicken, smothered with onion gravy and I damned sure wasn't about to pass that up! I ordered that with a side of rice and some greens and corn bread and I was able to take a good portion home to eat later on. Yes, I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Everything I come in here I'm treated like family. Major points. Now on to the food. The portions are huge! Expect to take home a doggybag! I got the double D, with a side of greens and macaroni and cheese. Let's talked about the greens! Piping hot, Cooked and seasoned to Perfection and no stems!! That's huge in my family. The greens shall have no stems!! The macaroni isn't anything special, I come from a Black/Rican Family so we aren't allowed
To really positively comment on others Mac n Cheese, but it's delicious and it's creamy and it's cheesy! Shhhhh don't tell my family I said that. Haha.. now on to the main attraction the chicken and the waffles! The waffles and chicken are better than Roscoes, Amy Ruth's and Gladys Knights combined. Yes I've had all three! The waffles for one are huge and full Of flavor.. vanilla and cinnamon? Check. Sorry Roscoes, your waffles kinda suck... Oh yeah anyway, The chicken is huge, juicy and crispy. Not over cooked like cough cough Amy Ruth's . Okay I'll stop throwing jabs. 

Eat here! The prices aren't horrible. The koolaid will give you that sugar rush you've craved and the food is made with lots of love. 
There is a lot of seating, a lot of parking, and the environment is very diverse. Bring the family."}
{"text":"The service at this location was great, until one of the servers managed to incorporate throwing up in into a conversation while I was nursing a hangover. Never a good idea to talk throwing up to a customer that is eating.duh!! This conversation led to more inappropriate words from the employee until he finally left....grrrrr!!!

Had the biscuits& gravy special ( $10.95 ), no bueno. I like my gravy simple...just some gravy with a little sausage running through,thats it. Can't stand it when there is onions, peppers, celery, carrot...yuck!! And they served those generic potatoes that are big flavorless cubes that they put in the deep fryer. Should have just had the chicken and waffle, lesson learned."}
{"text":"I went today for lunch with my husband and really enjoyed everything!!

What we had: 

fried chicken- this was the best I have ever had..it was juicy and flavorful and the skin crispy and delicious

fired catfish: The Best!! wonderful flavor and perfectly cooked

beans over rice- tasted just like homemade, it was really good, did need a little salt though

mac-n-cheese- yummy..not the best I have had, but still good

cornbread- absolutely perfect and buttery

sweet tea- this was the best part of the meal and they gave us a to go cup so we could take it with us

SERVICE- very welcoming from the time we opened the door until the time we left...they all seem to work together and we were very well taken care of

Thank you Lo Lo's !!!!

{"text":"three words- BOMB DOT COM!

This place is amazing. Yummy chicken, fresh food. They do soul food very well. Tastes like family recipes, feels like a family vibe. The servers are incredible! Cant wait to come back to Arizona so I can eat here again!"}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles not much more to say. Fries chicken was great, then only to mix in the sweetness of waffles?! Wish I had somewhere like this in my hometown."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! They were playing Jodeci when I walked in... About  to grub on some chicken & waffles..."}
{"text":"I went to Lo Lo's back when it was pre-renovated in the 'hood' and it was good. Tried this location and they definitely got a remodel but man, the prices and food are still good. I only looked at the original menu section Hood Classics) and got Betty's Boob - a waffle and chicken breast for $9. Breast was slightly dry but hot sauce took care of that. The waffle was to-die for though. Oh and service was awesome too."}
{"text":"I must say...being from CA....Lo-Lo's has Roscoe's beat. It isn't as soggy with oils as Roscoe's. Def still heavy food but damn good. And that red velvet cake! Kill me now."}
{"text":"Bombay! Had the chicken with gravy with grilled onions dam it doesn't get any better than that,side of Mac n cheese and potatoes with gravy, waffles are so good everything taste homemade kool-aid is perfect to top it all off"}
{"text":"very good fried chicken and okay waffles, friendly sevice. we felt riipped off because they charged us $ 3.50 each for soft drinks and four dollars each for a very small serving of cole slaw. i would not recommend nor go back."}
{"text":"Simply put: Fun; friendly; fantastic! Everything on their menu is amazeballs and I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Larry LoLo White has gotten a little too big for his britches! While it's wonderful that he has brought some glam to SoPho, let's get real... It's soul food! Valet parking imposed, no call-in to go orders, pricey food. They do have some of the best fried chicken, greens and banana pudding around though. Careful Larry, cons are beginning to outweigh the pros! Maybe a little soul searching?!"}
{"text":"After reading so many great reviews about this place, I just had to give it a try. My experience was not as great as all the Hype. As soon as I arrived after circling the block looking for a place to park, I was greeted by a redicoulos wait in line, outside in the Arizona Blazing sun. Did I mention there is no shade and it\"s HOT outside. As soon as you get inside and sit down, you'll realize it\"s even hotter inside, then add in the humidity from everyone sweating cause it\"s so crowded in there. Nothing like sweating your butt off as you eat your food! As for the food, it was good. Fried chicken was fantastic and the Macaroni and cheese is splendid! Unfortunetly I wasn't impressed with the waffles :( they wernt bad but not good either. My suggestion would be to visit this establishment during arizonas cooler months Nov-April unless you like sweat with your food."}
{"text":"Locally owned and operated, Nice clean, bright new standalone location in Scottsdale.  Staff was friendly, welcoming, and appropriately apologetic for the insanely slow arrival of food from the kitchen, which was clearly overwhelmed on this surprisingly packed Monday night when the college kids are still gone for the holiday; Tempe appearing to be virtually dead and Scottsdale very quiet - but LoLo's big bright new location: packed.  Figuring the place must truly newly opened as in perhaps the first week or two at a brand spanking new location, and seeing my friendly host and server and the rest of the staff scrambling throughout, I made allowances and made not a complaint about the 75 minute wait for my (massive) soul food platter, but on learning this location had been open for going on 4 months, only the friendliness and apologies of the staff  - and seeing others all around me suffering similarly kept me from leaving payment for the first quart jar of sweet tea, giving up and walking out.  

Half-sweet tea was just right (so you can imagine fully loaded!), and lord knows when it finally did arrive, the serving was generous: 3 LARGE pieces meaty chicken neither greasy nor dry: good!.  The collard greens nicely done and perfected with a self-administered shot of hot pepper vinegar: very good. The house mac-n-cheese rich and cheesy but barely warm on arrival; The massive sweet cornbread muffin topped with generous mound of whipped butter probably the highlight of the meal, I knew I'd be packed but was jonesing for a slice of the house special red velvet cake that I'd had long ago at the tiny old downtown location - and so saved the massive chicken breast and half the mac for tomorrow, but this was not the red velvet of old: red yes, velvet not so much. Not \"bad\" per se, but a tad on the dry side, and in the midst of the half I was eating, planning to save rest for tomorrow, there was a mildly off-putting slightly \"bitter\" flavor to a couple of bites sufficient sufficient for me not want the rest  and ask to have it taken off my bill.  

I've enjoyed the old downtown Phoenix location in the past and I look forward to being able to speak similarly of this location in the future. From the packed house tonight, this location is already a success, but these fine hard working folks will need to iron out some wrinkles to maintain it. 

(Note: edited 1/10/15 to correct wait time from 90 to \"only\" 75 minutes to get food)."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been to this Scottsdale location since it moved from the plaza on Thomas. For a Saturday early afternoon, this place was packed! 

I went with coworkers on duty, and one had never been. We were seated comfortably right away. This new place is a zillion times more comfortable and fun than the old place. The music was crazy loud though, which made it difficult to hear.

I had the Puff's chicken with a waffle (of course). My friends had the Puff's chicken with fries and an omelet (don't worry, I gave her a hard time for that one). The food was hot, tasty and fresh. My friend did say that her omelet was a bit on the bland side (insert a 'told you so' here). The chicken breading was off the chart, as usual - the same that is used on the chicken, the Fat Azz and the Fat Cat. The food came out pretty fast, which we were worried about with such a busy place.

I tried a sweet tea this time, and holy sugar cubes was that sweet! I had to have the waitress add some regular ice tea to tone it down! I may just be diabetic by now.

Our service was top notch, and I'm always down to introduce Lolo's virgins to the fantastic fare that awaits them!

PS: Law enforcement and military friendly."}
{"text":"I am a true believer!!! Ate there on a Friday for lunch place was packed... we were seated quickly.  I ate the Double D two chicken breasts and a waffle..loved the chicken it was crispy on the out side and tender and juicy on the inside just right!! Waffle was good had hint of cinnamon and melted butter. Washed it all down with some sweet tea yum!"}
{"text":"What can I say that has not been said already.

This place is a Foodie's version of Crack!

I was half way home when I wanted to turn around and go get me some more!

OMG! It was just so delicious!! 

Starting with the giant mason jar of the coldest Ice Tea I've ever had and it was perfectly brewed not too strong or bitter. I got the unsweetened.

I ordered a chicken breast with a waffle and a side of mac and cheese

Everything arrived steaming hot, even the syrup! I Love that!
My waffle had a scoop of butter that was twice the size of a golf ball, The chicken was so crispy and flavorful, not too spicy or salty but just right, it wasn't even greasy.

My Husband got the same with a side of cheesy eggs, He was lickin' his fingers and bobbin' his head.....so what does that tell ya!

All in all it was the best we've ever had, We Will be Going back!

After the withdrawals wore I off I slipped into a complete food coma and slept the whole way home!"}
{"text":"Incredible. The only reason I give this restaurant 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the service. It was lacking a bit and they even forgot 1/2 of my order when it was time to come out. None-the-less I ordered the #1: KK. 3 pieces of chicken, 3 waffles, grits and eggs. Everything was fantastic. It tasted as if it were cooked right at home. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I came here back in September 16' after wanting to go this restaurant for so long. I was defintely not let down. My group and I came here on Saturday night around 7:30 pm ish PST. I called the restaurant prior to coming to see if there was a wait and I was informed that it wasn't, however when we arrived at the restaurant it was a wait. I was quoted about 20 mins, but we were seated about 5 mins or less after arriving. Major kudos to the staff for that! This location is a nice size with a really chill/fun vibe. There was a DJ, check out my photos, this made the experience really fun. He played some old school jamz and new school hits. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. It did take a little long for our food to come out, I'm guessing this was due to the restaurant being really busy when we were seated. I noticed after the crowd kind of died down, people that came in after us and ordered got their meals right away. 

The food was excellent. I had the breast and waffle (so so good) and also got a chance to taste the catfish bites (so so yummy), the mac n cheese (really cheesy), and red beans n rice (very tasty). My favorite dishes were the waffles and cat fish bites. The fried chicken was hot and fresh and good, but nothing really spectacular. If I ever come back I will defintely be ordering two waffles, yes they are not that big and yes I am probably considered greedy, and the cat fish bites. I defintely recommend Lo-Lo's and whenever I have the chance to come back to the Arizona I will have at least one meal at Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles."}
{"text":"AMAZING. Any place with chicken & waffles this good and Kool-Aid on tap is worth all my time, energy, love & affection"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed. First time here at the Phoenix location. Came in around 5pm after work. Decided to sit outside, because it was about 80 degrees out. Restaurant was not busy at all. Waiter greeted us nicely. Gave us a few mins to look over the menu. Waiter took our orders a few mins later. I order # 3 with watermelon Kool-Aid and my cousin ordered chicken strips. I wasn't too sure what was going on. It took 35 mins for our food to come out. That's unacceptable! At any restaurant. Especially if the restaurant isn't busy.  Timed passed the waiter only came to check on us twice. It was not the waiter who took our order who checked on us. People came in after us got done eating  before we got our food. The wait time killed the whole experience. Couldn't enjoy the food like I wanted too. Overall I have to give this location 1 star."}
{"text":"I visited Lo-Los on the hunt from some soul food after relocating from the southeast. This is what the locals recommended but I was not very impressed. Food was okay, could have been better seasoned and the dining experience was meh. Needless to say, I have not been back to visit since my initial visit when I first moved. Good for those who have not had true soul/comfort food but for someone like me -- it was just okay."}
{"text":"The food is alright. It's nothing to be excited about. The first time I ate at this place, it was was actually a small shack. I was appalled on how high the prices were. I just recently visited and the only thing I can say that is still enjoyable is the cool aid. Red or grape."}
{"text":"I can't get good fried chicken like this back home in Hawaii...so being able to enjoy Lo-Los is like a dream come true.  I gotta say the ambiance is on point, service is great, and the food...I mean this is damn good fried chicken.  Even the local beer hit the spot.  I'd def make it a point to come here and recommend that friends come here when visiting Phoenix/Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Just to make sure I didn't hit them on an off day, I tried this place again.  Unfortunately, I just confirmed everything I wrote in the first review.  They're really just not very good.  Sorry Lo-Lo's."}
{"text":"Wow This place is just too much awesomeness in one place. They have some great friend chicken and their waffles are delicious with a hint of cinnamon. Mmmmm they go together so well. The portions are huge so be careful...they will probably have to roll you out of there. Also, there are two locations, but be sure to do the original in South Phoenix if you want some atmosphere with your food. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Might be the slowest service Ive ever encountered. Ordered 1 waffle sandwich. Still standing here 20 minutes later. Only one person ahead of me..."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but it was just so-so. 

Pros
- Gravy and onions were good
- Good atmosphere, very friendly and helpful staff who seemed happy to work there

Cons
- Chicken was crispy, but BLAND
- Waffles had a nice hint of cinnamon flavor, but were nothing to write home about. The texture was off - not fluffy at all, kind of chewy, deflated. I broke a plastic fork trying to cut into one.

Would I come back for chicken and waffles? Probably not, unless I could just order fried chicken skin. KFC on top of a homemade waffle would taste much better. Would I come back to try the other soul food on the menu? Sure. It was a fun restaurant with a friendly staff."}
{"text":"Three stars due to the service and the fact that I found a fly in my food. Kinda suxs because I would love to go back there but with that bad combo I may not be able to. The chicken and greens were awesome. The waffle was really good to right up to the fly being in it.  I know stuff happens and I was told that the waffle was gonna be taken off my crack but my brother and I split the cost for the whole family and my food ended up on his as well as his food ended up on my check, CONFUSED?!? That's was our experience in a nutshell. I will add that the Lo Lo punch is a great cocktail."}
{"text":"This is about the 7th place around the country that I've had Chicken & Waffles. Very authentic, the atmosphere is what it should be.
Service- outstanding, very helpful and friendly- 4stars
Drinks- big cool bottles- 4 stars
Collard Greens - spicy, tasty, make your momma proud and eat some- 5 stars
Mac N cheese - not that great, I mean it's better than the out of the box stuff, but after reading the reviews I expected more of the gourmet style. - 3 stars
Red Velvet cake- a bit dry and bland- 3 stars

Will I return next time I'm in the area- sure thing"}
{"text":"The inside of this restaurant is very clean and decorated well. I have never eaten at a soul food restaurant before but it was recommended so we went there. I've never had fried chicken so good. Lolo's gravy is to die for. Its a little spicy but gives it a nice kick. The sweet tea is delicious and refreshing served in country mason jars which I love. The fried green tomatoes were out of this world. Just one thing, bring your appetite because they are not greedy with their portions, you will need a to go box for sure. Yes, I would eat here again."}
{"text":"I came here looking for something I had never had together: chicken and waffles. The chicken legs were fantastic, but the waffles were so so. Either way, I washed it down with some \"drank.\" LOL! I may come here again, but it won't be for at least a year before I recover from the calorie coma!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, good food and one of the best Bread Puddings this side of the Delta."}
{"text":"Love this place! Lo-Lo's is a great place to try something different before a D-Backs or Suns game. I recommend you try it if you like chicken and well... waffles.

{"text":"My kind of place! Large portions, a lot of butter on things, and delicious sweet tea! I'm on vacation and was brought here by my local friend. It is definitely worth the money, great chicken, big waffles, and mason jar drinks. I had 3 pieces of chicken, 2 waffles, scrambled eggs with cheese and onion, grits, and a sweet tea for $20. Great environment and good location, parking is very limited and valet is required when the parking lot is too full. Overall I think it's a great place"}
{"text":"As the year comes to an end, one of my goals was to try the Famous LoLo's Chicken and Waffles...Let me just say, this place did not disappoint!

Modern style establishment with an old school vibe with many of the greats pictured on their walls such as Louis Armstrong, Ray Charles and Muhammad Ali. The employees were friendly, helpful and welcoming from the moment we entered. Fun menu with enticing names for their the dishes such as, \"Phat Azz Samich, Yo Mamma's Biscuits & Gravy and A Jar Of Drank\" 

Ordered the Uncle Brotha's Shrimp & Grits, Three Piece Chicken Smothered in Gravy & Onions along with a waffle, Collard greens and Mac & Cheese for our sides...Everything tasted of fresh and quality ingredients. Crispy, tender, juicy golden brown chicken paired with the Soft, aromatic and flavorful waffles covered with syrup is just one reason I will be back! Fresh shrimp cooked with sautéed mushrooms, Scallions and bacon over a bed of grits was a great combination of greatness! I could talk all day about the food, but I believe it's best for people to try Lo-Lo's themselves!

Thank you Allison for the great recommendations and amazing service!"}
{"text":"Excellent fried chicken and waffles. Server very friendly and good."}
{"text":"I loved it....  Waffles and Chicken.... What a concept!  I even had Kool Aid for my drink....  Mac n cheese, cornbread and more.....  This place is awesome and our group of 21 loved it!  A must try eatery...."}
{"text":"Ever since they upgraded the building, they've downgraded their food--maybe cut their food budget to pay for the building? The food all tastes a lot more processed and sugar-filled. I'd bet that they are using high fructose corn syrup vs. sugar in their waffle mix! Last two times we ate here, all of us had sugar crashes and stomach aches. I'm so bummed!!"}
{"text":"Food is good the waiting staff sucks! They guys were better than the women by far but there is some real room for improvement."}
{"text":"I am very happy with my experience here. The mac n cheese was delicious! All our drinks were served in a mason jar with plenty of ice and the refills kept coming! Portions are generous and you will definitely feel you got your money's worth! Really coming back!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place today for my nieces birthday. Our first time. Hostess was very polite. Waitress was very nice. My husband's food came very hot (The Platter). My nieces food (chicken and waffles) came hot. I ordered 2 thighs and fries. Both were luke warm. My corn bread was good. Better if it was hot. I reheated my food for dinner and the flavors are great.  Atmosphere is very nice. I did not complain about it I just don't do that. I will try one more time. If it goes better I will revise my rating. Thank you."}
{"text":"Had the worse experience here I was expecting good service. But instead had an hour wait for food then when I received my plate I had dry overcooked chicken, my friends chicken was cold, and we had ordered a plate of fries and they didn't arrive till after we had finished our food not to mention we had to get up and get our own utensils. When we spoke to the manager they said they would take off our drink but we still had to pay for everything."}
{"text":"it saddens my heart to type this review!!!  sorry lo lo's but the truth needs to be told.

my family of 8 adults and 2 children arrived at the restaurant at 1:30 pm on 1/2/13.  we were told the wait was going to be 25 minutes.  we didn't mind because we have always had an awesome experience in the past.  well, 30 minutes goes by and i check in with the hostess desk.  i asked what the hold was.  zoe, the hostess said that we have a large party so it will take longer.  totally understandable.  the hostess was not trying to accommodate for our large party by saving single tables in an area to be combined together.  so smaller party's were being seated before us.  so finally,  zoe the hostess, caught on and started saving tables to accommodate our party.  50 minutes later we were finally sitting down.

we ordered our drinks and meals at the same time.  it took 20 minutes to get our drinks.  it took an additional 25 minutes to get our meals.  the food was great!

i'm not bitching for bitching sake.  the expanded building is nice and we are happy for the business owners but something was lost.  we didn't have that hometown feel.  we miss all the signatures and pictures.  we miss sitting by the fountain drink machine and bathrooms all in the same room.  lol.  our server didn't make us feel welcomed.  our family members have been in the food business and they were up in arms with what we experienced.  it seemed like the servers don't have the experience to handle a larger restaurant experience.

WARNING:  IF YOU HAVE A LARGE PARTY, YOU WILL PROBABLY HAVE A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!"}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing.  Will definitely be coming back when I'm in town.  The Kool-Aid takes me back to my childhood"}
{"text":"I see what you're trying to do here and I do like it, I can't just grant a good review for only being.  What I don't understand is the overblown reviews for the place, to me it is not worth five stars.  First of all, it closes at 7pm on a Saturday, no good.

Had 3 pieces of fried chicken, 2 waffles, cornbread and mac and cheese.  While all of this was good, it wasn't great.  The chicken was juicy and well seasoned, but it was lacking for meat.  The mac and cheese seemed to use liquid cheese, instead of taking the time to really create some down-home goodness.  I'm going to stick with Honey Bears for my glutenous indulgences.

I wish Lolo's had some outside perspective on their food and menu.  This type of place can compete where there aren't many options but there are so many restuarants that have better quality, better service and cleaner spaces in the area.  

The Fried Chicken (strips) at Four Peaks beat this place.  Bring on the hate mail."}
{"text":"I do like this place! But I learned something the hard way after scarfing a full fried chicken dinner, complete with Mac n Cheese, rolls and fried okra. Then stepped out into 100 plus degree heat and ended up in rush hour traffic on Hwy 10. DO NOT OVERDO IT! Lol. 

My meal was fresh, hot and delicious and I ate like it was the coldest day in a Wisconsin winter. Normally warming the belly and filling the void that freezing temperatures leave in you. But I was not  back home, I was in Phoenix, Arizona. My belly was still warmed, but I was too full too fast for such a hot day. 

I could see myself tearing up another hot meal when it cools off in PHX. In the meantime, I shall be back to check out my additional options. 

P.S.

The \"Purple Drank\" hit the spot on that hot @$$ day!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!  First time I've had shrimp and grits and I now love it!  Had a nice kick to it with some nice large shrimp.  Also you have to try the fried green tomatoes.  The homemade lemonade is delicious too.  Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"The first few times I had Lo Los was when they were still serving in that small but busy house. Since then, I've always mentioned it to my friends about how AMAZING their food is. I finally made it to their new location with my friends in tow and they still talk about how good their food was months later. 

Waffles are the best I've had. The saltiness of the butter mixed with the sweetness of the syrup is literally to die for. (Drooling typing this out tbh) 
Cornbread is delicious.
Sweet tea and red koolaid is also delicious.

If you want great food, great service and a great environment, come to Lo Los!!!!"}
{"text":"Waited an hour for over-fried, salty, dry, nasty fried chicken. If you're coming from CA and have had any chicken and waffles from there, don't bother coming here. It is worst than Roscoe's and I don't even think Roscoe's that great. Safe your money and go to Brown Sugar Kitchen or Lois the Pie Queen in Oakland, CA. Lolo's cornbread was dry and probably made from the box. Their Mac and Cheese tastes like Kraft's Mac and Cheese. The chicken sandwich was bland. It the WORST chicken and waffles I've ever eaten. Waffles are soggy and the syrup is gross. I would never come here again even if I got paid to. Yuck yuck yuck!!"}
{"text":"I eat here because they guarantee happy kids who'll eat. The fried chicken is awesome like Mrs. White's. The collard greens are tasty, too. The waffles are amazing. What is that spice: cardamom? Jugs of Kool-Aid will satisfy your need for a \"drank.\" This is definitely my happy place."}
{"text":"not a big fan of chicken and waffles... but this place was decent."}
{"text":"When Yelpers say this is one of the best places in Phoenix, I had to go!
We went during the week, and luckily the place was empty. We were seated right away and ready to feast!
We started with Kool-Aid, so I knew this was gonna be a good meal!
The food was good.  Portions were pretty generous... we shared a meal and a side and got full. The chicken was a little bland so each piece had to be smothered with their gravy. The waffles had a nice cinnamon touch to them. 
The service was okay, conidering it took them forever to get us the bill. But I guess you dont need the greatest service when it comes to fried chicken. 
The food was better at Mrs. Whites, but the atomesphere is better here... so you can choose whats more important!"}
{"text":"A philosophical elder of my profession commonly says \"Everyone needs three vices.  Sex and chocolate don't count.\"  

If I still lived in Phoenix, LoLo's Chicken and Waffles would definitely be one of my vices.  The chicken is pure fried goodness. The mac n'cheese is creamy and crispy goodness. The waffles are BEYOND DELICIOUS.  

If I could give any future LoLo's consumers a hint it would be this: if you are sensitive to too much sugar like I am, don't waste your precious pancreatic islets on the beverages.  I succumbed to the peer-pressure and got an Arnold Palmer, which of course comes in a quart-sized Mason jar.  I reached my sugar capacity before the meal even started.  I can only imagine the explosion of flavor in my mouth I would have experienced had I not wasted all my buds on sweetened tea and lemonade."}
{"text":"Very bad service from all the employees. Told its a 15 minute wait time. Turns out it was 50 because they kept sitting people that came after us. When we were seated. 10 minutes passed by before anyone even acknowledged us. That being said, the only good part of the visit was our waiter. He was awesome, and gave the best service. Other than that, we will never go back there. If I could give it 0 stars, I would."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Big portions so it is definitely worth your money! If you want to have the best chicken and waffles you have ever had, this is the place : order Lolo's Chicken and Waffles. And their customer service is amazing! All of the employees are so personable and really make you feel at home."}
{"text":"Waffles soggy af. Grits greasy af. Chicken def not fresh, it felt like it was sitting in a heat drawer. Eggs whites were runny. 20$ down the drain. Boo"}
{"text":"I had my birthday dinner here last week. Not only was the staff attentive but all of the food was delicious. 

The menu is conveniently labeled with popular combinations of their chicken and waffle platters. Not only that but they also have pancake options such as red velvet which are absolutely amazing. 

To make things an even sweeter deal this location boasts a full bar and is located close to the heart of old town so you can keep the party going or crash out in a chicken coma at the Hyatt next door."}
{"text":"Yoooo . . I hate to say this seeing as how I grew up in South L.A. just a 15-minute drive away from the Pico (and best, IMO) Roscoe's. But Lo-Lo's . . they got ya boy lol. Low-key better than Roscoe's. Lo-Lo's has bigger pieces of chicken, insane waffles, Red Velvet pancakes, creamy grits that'll make you shout in your seat, and  . . wait for it . . KOOL-AID ON TAP!!! No joke. You want red or blue? haha We went on a Sunday am so it was crowded and the food was a bit slow coming out, but it was worth it. No wait even though it was busy and TVs everywhere to watch the football games live. Their menu has way more options than Roscoe's and they're cheaper, too. They also have a bar."}
{"text":"I used to be so impressed with lolos but I tried their new location and is it just me? Feel like flavor went down :(

My chicken was crispy but oily and only had very strong flavor on certain areas... Like it wasn't evened out . 

The rice was good but feel like waffles aren't crispy yummy anymore...    Maybe it's just my imagination but just wasn't super impressed . 

Service is good, food was actually good but so so so oily ."}
{"text":"Great fried chicken, delicious waffles.  Visited on a Saturday and although the restaurant's air conditioning wasn't very effective and they were understaffed, had an awesome meal.  Our server, who was also working the bar area was friendly and attentive, despite being busy.  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Met a friend here for lunch. He knew nothing about the place, just said \"damn good chicken.\" The chicken was crispy outside, moist and hot inside. The waffles were light and crunchy. Since it's a new location, they may be going through some growing pains based on the negative reviews, but we were very happy with everything we tried."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time coming to this establishment and doubt I will be returning. It took at least 30-45mins for our food to come out. The chicken was dry and didn't have a drop of seasoning. The eggs were disgusting. Soul food where????"}
{"text":"I called to place a pickup order and was super frustrated because they don't take orders over the phone anymore and I don't like going into their restaurant and waiting for various different reasons. But I ended up placing an order with doordash and the manager was very polite and took care of my order personally."}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix for the first time and Yelped what seemed to be the best place to eat.  Lo-Lo's popped up towards the top of the list.  I've never had chicken and waffles before - I'm not a huge fan of fried chicken (waffles are OK), but wanted to try it out at least once.  This seemed like a good place to go....although I had a feeling the place was going to be overrated. 

While I don't know the Phoenix area well, the restaurant seemed to be located in the industrial boonies - the street looked a bit sketchy, and there was this ghettoish sign painted on a building pointing you to the way of Lo-Lo's.  There was plenty of street parking, and I don't recall seeing a parking lot.  It's a cute looking shop - shaped like a tiny house decorated with some neon lights.  

The place is small - I recall about 6 or 7 tables and the restaurant had most of the tables occupied on a Friday night.  Definitely not a place for big groups unless you want to take over the entire restaurant.  It's a casual spot - waiter service is casual as well.  You don't have a dedicated waiter - they have 2 or 3 people on staff to help the customers as needed (which makes sense for such a small place).

I'm not quite sure why, but it took us a little while to order - there were a decent amount of items on the menu, but because the menu items were mainly combinations of the same thing, we were confused on what/how to order.  For our party of 3, we ended up ordering (I think):  Baby Ray ($13 or 12), Lo-Lo's ($12 or 11), and Stupid Fries ($8).  This place should really be a $$ rating vs. $ - our total bill including tax ended up to be a bit over $40 including tax & tip.  This was just for 2 entrees and 1 appetizer.

Food came in a reasonable amount of time - probably about 10 to 15 minutes.  Portions were reasonably sized - not too big or small.  We had 5 or 6 pieces of chicken and 4 or 5 waffles to share.  The chicken was OK - I didn't find anything special about it.  Meat was tender and the crust was OK.  It helped adding some hot sauce and vinegar to help enhance the flavor.  Waffles were OK - could have been a bit better if the outside was crispier.  

Overall, this place was OK - it wasn't exactly a place to rave home about.  One of the people at our table compared it to Roscoe's and said it was about the same or Roscoe's was a bit better."}
{"text":"I have never been into soul food per se, but my husband woke up craving some chicken and waffles, and well, you can guess where we ended up. We were so pumped that there was Kool Aid on the menu, so we ordered that immediately. I don't know why every restaurant doesn't do this... Kool Aid is amazing. The service was decent - our waitress was quite friendly, and the food came out quick. I got biscuits and gravy, which was pretty delish. The gravy was thick and filling. So filling, in fact, that I couldn't finish them. I also got a side of mac and cheese which was not great, and I didn't eat a lot of it. Overall, I'd give this place a solid 3. I'd come back again, but mostly because my husband thought it was some kind of wonderful."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of Lo-Lo's.  In fact, Lo-Lo's has ruined fried chicken for me as they do it better than I have ever had in my life or likely will ever have again!  The breading is light, crispy, and tastey.  The waffles are somehow soft and crispy at the same time and they have a bit of sweetness to them.  Again, I will only eat waffles at Lo-Lo's as everywhere else is a huge disappointment.  The only reason I am giving Lo-Lo's four stars instead of five is the price.  When I look over the menu, the prices seem completely reasonable, but by the time the bill comes I feel like I've spent way more money than for the food I received."}
{"text":"Top notch juicy crispy chicken and waffles,  what more can I say? The drinks are huge in mason jars, the lemonade is really good,  sweet, not too tart. They have other items on the menu as well but I would definitely recommend you try the chicken."}
{"text":"Their fried chicken is delicious. For sides, their potato salad, Mac and cheese, and corn muffin are my favorites. Corn muffin, as you can probably guess, is a bit sweet, but flavorful and not crumbly."}
{"text":"I've never written a review before but my experience here was so bad I feel the need to write one, I first sat down at a table where I kept having people bump into my chair, then the waitress came and greeted two tables at one time. Then we waited over an hour for food. Ordered the chicken and waffles. Food took so long they had to give me the waffles separate. The waffles came out not fully cooked. There was never a manager around either. Also you have to use valet. Overall it's safe to say this is the first and last time I'm ever going here"}
{"text":"The food tasted like it had been sitting out for days and microwaved back to life. I took back three dishes and our server was rude from the very start. I would not recommend eating here. EVER."}
{"text":"First...

Get the mac and cheese. 

Just do, it is good, rich, cheesy, creamy, slightly peppery and I just wanted more. 

I'm from Detroit and my grandparents were from the South (Kentucky, TN, Alabama).  I say this because I KNOW soul food.  Best I've had this side of Mississippi... or should I say Grand Canyon.  

Little pricey.  Each meal will cost between 12 to 15 bucks.  Drinks are 8.50 a pop if you're a Mimosa or wine drinker. 

But if you're Jones'n for some salty, fried goodness with Mac and Cheese... go here."}
{"text":"outstanding service! the food proportions are jaw dropping. this is our first visit of many more to come. love it!"}
{"text":"Love this place except for being seated near the drink station pretty much in the kitchen. That's kinda lame. Otherwise this place is next to amazing.



Remodeled now. My review was from before the remodel. 
Love this place."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times ...the food is okay compared to the one in Phoenix but it is closer to home. The service went from good to terrible! The six of us sat for 20 minutes and no one even came  we all walked out and prob will not come back. Would not be surprise if this place close down in a few months."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place and am only sad that it took me so long to try it! I got the chicken fingers with a waffle and a Kool-Aid. I love that you can get Kool-Aid in house as it's one of my favourite drinks from childhood. The waffle was absolutely delicious and HUGE and the chicken was very crispy and juicy. The corn bread was huge as well, and was really good. 
The service was also pretty fast and super friendly. If you have any love for rich Southern food, this place is definitely one to check out. I wish there was a closer location!"}
{"text":"I'm from LA and have had \"Chicken & Waffles\" at a local, well known chain a number of times.  Let me tell you, LoLo's is the winner hands down.

The service was great & friendly.  Our server was spot on, checking on us just the right amount.

I had the Waffle & Breast.  This breast was a full, meaty, delicious breast.  The waffle,mmmm delish!  The Mac N Cheese: Cheesy and plentiful.

My husband ordered up a Breakfast Combo Plate which included grits.  Large portion, delicious food.

They have 4 Kool-aid flavors on tap!  

LoLo's, come to LA (Inland Empire)!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been coming here since they had the little house they operated out of. On the basis of their food, they deserve 5 stars. I deducted because of parking, the hostile lady (mentioned by another Yelper, who also posted her photo), their insistence that people wait outside and the lack of adequate parking. I think that the parking and wait area issues needed to be addressed during the planning stages of the expansion/remodel. The place is beautiful, but lacks key components: a place for customers to wait (they have a patio with a misting system, but this may not suit everyone) and to park their vehicles. The hostile lady needs to go. That is a HR issue. Please don't tell people to wait outside in 100 degree plus weather.  On the bright side, they are so busy that they need more room ( add a second floor and acquire more parking?). I will park in the sketchy neighborhood, ignore the hostile lady and try to wait inside for their delicious food, but not everyone is willing to run a gauntlet for a meal. I am in love with their soul food platter, candy sweets, rice & beans, waffles, signature hot sauce and red velvet cake, so I will continue to be a customer."}
{"text":"Amazing food, makes the long wait understandable.  Our server, Tre, was excellent as well!  Thanks Lo-Lo's!"}
{"text":"Best waffles ever. Seriously. Now pair those perfectly cooked, cinnamon-y waffles with the best fried chicken, best shrimp and grits, and best banana pudding. Ever. Those are pretty much the only things I've tried... Oh and bacon but honestly, bacon is always amazing. Pretty much any where you go I recommend eating bacon. Moving on...

Before going to Lo-Lo's there are a few things you should know...
1. This is not a place to go when on a diet or attempting to make healthy choices. You CAN eat healthy here (egg whites and turkey bacon anyone?) BUT it's no fun!!! Why eat egg whites when you can eat grits oozing with butter, crispy always fresh fried chicken, and waffles drenched in sticky syrup? Splurge here, it'll be worth it.
2. The neighborhood this location is in is a tiny bit sketchy. Do NOT let this stop you from visiting. The place itself is not the least bit sketchy and the staff are all amazing. 
3. It's pretty small (they are currently building a larger space.) There could be a wait when you go (especially with a large group.) But the service is fast and the food comes out quickly. So fear not!

Now... If you made it to the end of this review, you either still have doubts about the amazingness of this place (or you would already be on your way there) OR you are just preparing yourself for your carb party. Either way, hurry. Deliciousness is waiting."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place. Today was my 2nd experience at Lolo's. Went to the one in Phoenix, about a few months ago. So I'm stoked they have a new location  conveniently down the street from work. The staff is soo friendly and helpful and the service in actually getting the food is extremely fast.

The food itself, amazing. Fried Chicken w/ Waffles (that I might add have an amazing flavor) doused in syrup and chased with some fruit punch kool-aid makes for a great lunch. 

I think I may need a nap now."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles what a combo! 
I honestly can't give this place more than three stars unfortunately considering they have something I truly love. Kool-Aid. Oh and also peach cobbler which I did have ,a little more about that later. 
The ambience of this place is nice the music is urban I should say, it's a highly decorated restaurant, the lights are a great level. 
It's important to add that this was a take-out order and prepared as a takeout. Unfortunately, the food which is why I am doing the review, it's just not enough for me to give a four or five stars to this restaurant. 

The food here is just too inconsistent and it's absolutely no \"SOUL\" to anything that I ordered. I ordered the typical chicken and waffles expecting a great meal unfortunately all I got was flavorless poorly crusted chicken and a a flavorless soft waffle with no personality. The most disappointing factor as when I ordered the peach cobbler. Again no soul. The cobbler came in a container that consisted of a cut that didn't offer me a full serving of peach cobbler. Meaning I received a cut of cobbler that had more bread then peaches and technically wasn't able to taste the entire cobbler serving but what I did have I was not impressed sadly. 

As for the customer service that I received (because I did order inside the restaurant) the cashier was very insightful on the menu and answered questions that I had. The to go order came with everything that it should have and packaging  as well as the bag were very sturdy. 
I honestly wouldn't recommend this place but I would choose this place with friends because of the menu choices and the ambience that could provide great laughs. I don't see the hype!"}
{"text":"Great place Great food. I'm a huge fan of the \"Uncle Brotha's\" Shrimp and Grits! And being a Cleveland native, I'm not a big \"Grit\" fan so that's saying something! Delicious. And they have Kool-Aid!"}
{"text":"Soooo excited that the fearless leader of the breakfast decided on this place for a UYE. Ive been hearing about it for a while, and it lives up to all the hype.

Its smaller, and very homey. The smells when you 1st walk in here are wonderful. It was super busy when we came here, and I wouldnt surprised if thats how it is always. We waited on their nice little patio for our entire group to arrive in order to be seated.

Finally our stragglers arrived and we were able to check out the menu. Very simple, home style food. Lots of different options to chose from. I decided on the classic chicken and waffles, my husband decided on just the waffle and a side of mac and cheese. His waffle was huge (thats what she said), and he really enjoyed his mac and cheese. I was very happy w/ my juicy chicken and waffle. It really was so so good. And the Koolaid! Awesome. It wouldve been better if it was served in Ball jars instead of Kerr jars, but Im biased. :)

Go here. Brave the wait and be deliciously rewarded."}
{"text":"Finally my husband and I checked this place out, and we loved it!  Of course, unless you have a death wish, you probably don't want to eat here every week, but we will be back once or twice a year.  The mac and cheese is the best I have ever had.  My husband loved the biscuits and gravy.  The waffles are crispy and fresh, and they serve real Kool-Aid.  This place is worth a try, plus they play old school 90's hip hop and \"slow jams\" which takes me back to high school."}
{"text":"Don't play yourself. 5 stars all day. All I'm saying is ... Lo Lo's over Roscoe's (Cali). Corn bread, mac n cheese, waffles, fried chicken, but that Kool Aid tho. Been to all the locations (in Az) Never disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place! The koolaid is wonderful and the catfish is to die for! However, it does take a long time to get your good!"}
{"text":"I hate to say it, but I am finally done with Lo-Lo's. 

The first time I ever went there it was wonderful. It was in this small house and the atmosphere and food was amazing with wonderful service. Then they moved.

I work pretty close so one time a coworker and I called in a lunch take-out order. From my prior experience of them being so busy I called well ahead of time to ensure it would be ready when I got there. It wasn't. I waited an extra half an hour and was told it was my fault because I called so early. Rude.

Regardless, the food was amazing and I wasn't going to let that ruin a restaurant for me. Went there once more with my boyfriend and had great food and great service. A few more times had take-out and they were all a success. 

Then my boyfriend and I took two of our friends there for a greasy hangover breakfast since they had never been there before. We were told the wait would be 40 mins. After an hour my boyfriend asked what had happened and they told us we missed it when we were called. Annoying but hey, maybe it was our fault and we sat back down expecting to be first in line. The hostess then came out and seated a group of like six who had gotten there way after us. Annoyed and STARVING we gave up and left. And I looked over at the hostess just livid and she looked right back at me with this smug look on her face.

Today was definitely the last straw. We ordered take-out and apparently they no longer accept payment upon arrival. You have to pay with a card up front. Thankfully I work at a bank and have an ATM on campus so I could deposit the cash into my account for the $70 order we made. They said we needed the card and ID to pick up the order and I told her I was sending someone else to pick it up, the girl on the phone told me she would make an exception as long as he had those two items. And of course they told my coworker when he got there they can't do that but luckily gave him the food. The chicken was dry and tiny and the waffles were super thin. 

I'm just over it. Now that Welcome Chicken and Donuts opened I'll just go there instead. They always have good service and the chicken is amazing. I'm sad that such a Phoenix staple has gone so down hill."}
{"text":"So about two weeks ago I went to Lo-Lo's chicken and waffle house with a couple of my friends for an English project on different cultures. I chose this place because I have never been here before and it would have been fun to hang out with my friends.
Once i walked in and drank and tasted their food i was blown away with how good it was. with the red kool aid and the chicken waffles really does make a great combination. and the service was great. sat us down really quick, got the food out quick, and were just really great hospitality. It was basically like going down south for lunch; it was a great experience.
If you or anyone you know wants a great meal either for breakfast, lunch, or dinner i truly believe you should try Lo-Lo's. But, i suggest you go to the new and nicer one in Scottsdale if you are not willing to go to the one in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Fried Chicken was good: 4
Catfish beignets was good: 4.5
Better than roscoes.
Customer service was great: 5
Mojito was excellent: 5"}
{"text":"I am visiting family in Phoenix & they told me about Lo-Lo's.   So I read the reviews here on Yelp first like any good Yelp'r should & I was a little disappointed because I was expecting greatness & it was just good.  I would say a little better than Roscoe's (in L.A.) but not by much.   I've been to other restaurants that use Mason jars... so no big deal. The waffle was definitely good.  The smothered fried chicken was not bad but nothing great about it either...probably because it was luke warm nearing cold.  I ordered the Catfish Beignets as an appetizer expecting that something different...we'll they didn't come out as an appetizer but as a side order with my meal & they were just catfish strips.  I think it gets such great reviews because of the lack of competition.   
45 minute wait (actually about 30) if you don't want to sit outside.  There's an outside waiting area adjacent to the outdoor dining which is a little confusing.  I'm told the place had really grown, & it does look great.   But at the end of it all... it's just good NOT GREAT!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome. Being from So Cal, I have high standards when it comes to Chicken and Waffles (Yay Roscoes!) Lo-Lo's delivered. Great chicken, yummy waffles and kool-aid served in a Mason Jar. The staff was very friendly and a lot of fun.  You really can't go wrong. 

Oh and according to a flyer they have a $399 Bereavement Special Package. This seriously made my trip."}
{"text":"The food was good & server was nice but I wasn't blown away. I'd go back simply to read the menu & try something else.  You will definitely leave feeling satiated.  The portions are generous. I had the biscuits & gravy, there was something a little off - a little bland like it was missing something but for my first time I was pleased.  The coffee was surprisingly good and brewed well - not watered down and a good temperature. I would've preferred a turbiando sugar (sugar in the raw), a minor thing of preference but I'd go back."}
{"text":"Roscoes who???? Best chicken and waffles ever ! Best selection and bomb drinks . Mikisha took care of us great service"}
{"text":"so far, this could be considered the best fried chicken I've tried in US. Now if you have a small stomach, order something with one piece...or you'll face a LOT of food. The idea of mixing a waffle with your chicken is already hilarious!. 

I was pleased with the options on spicy salsas they have....mmmm!! and finally I have tried good okra (not just fiber). It was all in all a great experience, but as my friend said...we have to leave before it get's dark!!"}
{"text":"annnnd....  get the red drink.  
I've had the fish, the chicken the stupid fries.   Its not good for you, BUT ITS SO GOOD.  Depends on the day, the biscuits are better some days then others. The red gravy is different day by day ans so is the sausage gravy.
The brunch menu is almost ready and i can't wait!"}
{"text":"First time ever being to ARIZONAs Lo Lo's and this place was sooo delicious omg .... seriously finger licking good !!! The okra , chicken strips and fries were AMAZING !!! 

They also offer koolaid  I thought that was cool and different  def a place to return to"}
{"text":"Look, when you're coming off of a long flight from the east to the west and someone asks if you're hungry-the growling and sounds from your stomach may actually answer the question for you! That's what happened to me recently when I arrived to Phoenix. My colleague promptly drove us to Lo-Lo's after leaving the airport and dammmnnnn!

Let me preface this by saying that I don't usually eat anything fried, but at Lo-Lo's you have to eat something fried if you want to truly immerse yourself in this eating experience. We had appetizers of fried green tomatoes that were deep fried to golden brown while the tomatoes remained juicy and succulent. Then we ventured into the \"Eats\" as they refer to this part of the menu here. I had the redfish with a side of mashed potatoes and greens. GEEZ!

If I'm going to eat this this stuff, then I'm going to EAT THIS STUFF!

But for real-the cornbread. This cornbread here-this cornbread here?! I'm still dreaming about that damn cornbread days later. Carb dreams about that cornbread...

Put it like this, I will not ever come back to Phoenix and not eat at least one meal at this place while there.

Live a little people!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love Lo-Lo's! And I love their new Scottsdale location. More for the location really, their original location has a totally different vibe. But luckily the food is the same at both places.

I always get the same thing - the Tre Tre's - two chicken legs and a waffle and of course red Kool-aid to wash down the grease. Their chicken is nice and crispy always cooked just right. Although I have heard the white meat pieces can be dry sometimes so I recommend the dark meat. Their waffles are fluffy and filling. And the sugar rush you get from the kool-aid is the perfect way to get going on a Saturday morning.

If you're really hungry the mac n cheese is a VERY good side. Nothing wrong with Mac n cheese for breakfast! And their red velvet cake is yummy too. 

On Sunday they have live gospel music that is a fun, lively addition to the meal.

This place is a true valley gem and has never disappointed."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Lolo's in a while you'll be amazed at how it's changed. At least I was. And don't worry, the changes are good. The place is WAY bigger than it used to be. They even have valet parking now! But it's still as packed as ever and the food is as awesome as ever.

I met up with some friends on Sunday morning. We had to wait about 25 minutes but they have a nice seating area on their patio so it was fine.

After we were seated the first thing we ordered was Kool-Aid. Red. This is the sweetest Kool-Aid I've ever had. They must use twice the sugar. But it is so good and it goes so well with the chicken and waffles. I always get the Tre Tre's - 2 drumsticks and a waffle. They really do have the best fried chicken in town and when you get some of the maple syrup on the chicken, it's just the best thing ever.

My friends ordered a croquette to have as a side and it was disappointing. For $4 it was pretty small, and they only got one. It was not really worth it. Go for the mac and cheese instead!

For a good soul food breakfast, nothing in town beats this place."}
{"text":"Gawd i love this place.  Anyone wanna meet me for chicken and waffles???

I got lost the first time i went looking for it, but the search was well worth it.  GREAT chicken and real homemade waffles that put eggos to shame.

Try the mac and cheese too.  I'm sure that if Lolos was closer to my house, i would gain 20 pounds"}
{"text":"I need to let you all know that ever since the expansion and more so the franchise Lo Lo's has been going down hill! I am very disappointed in several things concerning this location. Here we go with my list; yes list of complaints. I hope your paying attention Larry....

1. I think there is a lack of management. I say this because employee's are running amuck. The past 4 yes, 4 visits we have experience rude hostesses that were more concerned with their plans for the upcoming weekend or the poor performance of their fellow employees than helping the customers that pay their salaries. The last time we were in the hostess outright LIED to our faces and told us she had no booth's available. When were sat at a table; we saw the one in the front was empty it just hadn't been cleared of dishes that had been there for awhile. (I say awhile because no one left the building once we arrived and we waited about 5 minutes for the hostess to show up to greet us, then another 10 minutes to be sat even though the restaurant wasn't even a 4th full) and when I went up to ask for that booth. We were told that the couple that walked in behind us had requested it. 

2. The service has gotten slower with every visit and we have been going at different times.
Visit 1 of 4 on a Tuesday around 2:20pm we waited 35 minutes for an Omlette, 2 salmon croquettes, greens and mac n cheese. We took home a sock it to me cake and a banana pudding. The sock it to me cake was so dry it was not edible! By far the worst cake outside of the Red Velvet I got some years back that they had made using the cornbread mix by mistake UGH. 

Visit 2 of 4 on a Thursday around 8pm, place was not busy at all. We waited an hour and 10 minutes for 2 Toy Toy's, a Trey Trey, a Big ass samich and a 3 piece white with mac n cheese and greens. In addition no apology for the wait nothing and one of the Toy Toy's was ICE cold! 

Visit 3 of 4 was a Saturday night, but the restaurant was dead not even half full. which was shocking I have never seen it that empty on a Saturday night. What was more shocking was waiting an HOUR for two 3 piece dinners with sides! And after an hour wait the chicken was bland and the sides were cold! The butter wasn't even melting on the cornbread. 

Visit 4 of 4 Friday night very busy, our food came out about 15 to 20 minutes after we ordered it. Everything hot; but the chicken was bland like no salt had been used. 

Also clean up your act.... the couches on the patio are so filthy nasty stained and dirty that I wouldn't let my DOG sit on them UGH!

Prior to the franchise; we would receive fast, friendly service, delicious hot food and felt happy to return and bring all of our friends. Now it has been one epic fail after another. The staff is more concerned with their social lives than their jobs!

Given the last 4 experiences in the restaurant; and the fact that it is national fried chicken day several co-workers and I decided to order some food for lunch and pick it up. No big deal right?

WRONG! I called to place the order and the girl tells me \"We don't take to go orders; you have to come in and order it and wait here until it's ready\" SERIOUSLY??? Well folks be prepared for Lo Lo's downtown at least to go under soon! If they last another 2 years at this location I will be surprised. The service sucks, the food is going down hill and now you can't even do a phone order? These people treat you like you are doing them a damn favor by eating there! Which we are; because when we stop spending our hard earned money here; because of your funky attitudes like you've won a Michelin star you'll be out of jobs and out of business."}
{"text":"We went on Saturday October 29th. We got sat down and it took awhile for someone to get our drink orders and also we were ready to order our food. Our drinks was two lemonades and two kool aids for the kids. It took awhile to get our drinks. Our waitress didn't approach us that they ran out of lemonade it was a different waitress. So, we end up getting a pepsi. They brought our drinks and it took awhile for drinks. We were waiting and waiting for our food to come out and it took forever to get our food. We were just tired of waiting that we were about to leave. Right when we decided to leave the food came out. After that we ask for refills he took awhile to get our refills also. After that we ask for the check he took forever to get that too. Than he came out with our refills and the check. I complain to the manager and he said oh i'm sorry he is new. I understand he is new but everytime i was trying to get his attention he was just standing around doing nothing while we were waiting for our refills and check. How new is that???"}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant after hearing all the rave reviews and unfortunately I don't think I'll be coming back to this location. While the food was pretty good, nothing else was. The staff was horrible and rude when it came to everything from being the hostess down to waiting on tables. No one seemed interested in thier paying jobs or cared what thier customers needs were. We waited over 45 minutes to get a table simply because the staff failed to keep up with busing tables and cleaning them off in a timely manner when other patrons left. After that, it took 15 minutes just to get our waitress to pay attention to us only for her to leave half way through our service, never to return. An hour after ordering our food, it arrived with a completely different waitress who was able to salvage what was left of our good time. And did I mention there were flies, most likely due to the slow clean up skills from the staff. I wish I could blame being busy as to why we were treated so poorly but a good chunk of the tables were empty. All that was left on them were the previous cutomers meals that still had not been cleaned up. Finally, we were informed that senior and military discounts are only applicable Monday through Thursday"}
{"text":"Lolo's Chicken & Waffles!! Where do we start. 

We had a large party (12 to be exact) and everything turned out great. Seating policy is that everyone in the party must be present before the party is sat, so even if certain people come early to reserve seating, you won't be put on the list until everyone arrives. 

Cannot remember our servers name but she was fabulous. Did a great job. Ordered #4 with two waffles and two chicken and it was awesome !! 

However, the best part of the meal was the sweet tea. If I could come here everyday for that sweet tea I would. (This is not an exaggeration. That tea was brought here by the tea gods themselves) 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place has really yummy chicken drumsticks!! Soo juicy and tender!! I love how the drinks come in these old jam containers!! And mighty big they are!! They have blue kool-aid too! haha! The people in there are all really friendly and love their t-shirts.  The grits were okay...the trick is eat it when it is pippin hot and with all that butter melting...once it's cold, it's not good anymore. Their candied yams are really yummy too."}
{"text":"I have been to Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles in LA and this place is so much better!!  Awesome food and Tuesday Night is live Jazz Music.  Great place and great times."}
{"text":"So good! They even have cocktails with Kool-Aid! A great place to chow down on some fried chicken (moist, good flavor), waffles, grits, fried okra, greens, and a whole lot more.  You will definitely be feeling the itis before too long. The venue is spacious and the bathrooms were impeccably clean and very stylish. Yolo, so go to Lolo's and indulge."}
{"text":"This place was right next to where I lived. It's definitely one of those places you should go if you're near by. It's not one of those places I recommend driving 30 minutes for. 

The food is delicious and the service is great. 

I really enjoyed their catfish and veggies. Also their chicken and waffle is pretty good. I kept going in for more bites. 

I do have to say, one if the people I went with did not get their food for a while so it was awkward as we ate without him. He told us to eat our food because his was not coming out. When we asked about his food they kept saying it would come out. As I was almost more than half-way through my meal his food (finally) came out. When he asked for it to be taken off the bill, the server took it off without any issues."}
{"text":"On Election Day, and in the late afternoon, I had an hour to kill before an interview so I came in to get a nice cold drink and a salad to eat. Seen this place but never been and once I was in, it was quiet, somewhat empty and I was greeted immediately with a hello and a soft smile. I was seated and within minutes my server (Mike) with a smile asked how my day was going and got my drink order. I ordered an Arnold palmer and this place is the first place that asked me if I like tea or lemonade at the bottom, I was impressed. When I got my drink I was even more impressed as it came in a huge mason jar. Loved it.  I put my order in for the \"Cool Bre Bre's chicken salad\" and I asked if the chicken can be grilled instead of breaded and fried, the server said no problem. 

While I waited, I went to the restroom, and I hardly ever yelp about restrooms but this one was oh lord so clean... I was impressed. 

Food arrived and it looked good and delivered as ordered. Taste was okay and nothing special. The bacon bits were a great addition to the dish flavor wise but the candied walnuts were too much, or at least in my plate. 

The experience wants a bad one after all. Will return hopefully for breakfast."}
{"text":"I think Lolo's is better than Roscoe's.  And Roscoe's is pretty good.  So that means Lolo's is better than good."}
{"text":"Been a couples times now. 
Pros:
Whenever I've ordered chicken and waffles, the chicken has been perfectly cooked. No complaints there, except it'd be nice to have more meat. The banana dessert was great. The menu is unique, with cute southern names for each menu item. Have had no problems with servers or hosts so far.
Cons:
Can be loud and crowded depending on the time of day. To be honest, this place is not disappointing but not mind blowing. Makes me wonder if Roscoe's would offer that out of this world experience. But for now while I'm stuck in AZ, Lo-Lo's will do the job."}
{"text":"Ok so I didn't get the actual fried chicken w/the waffle touching my plate. BUT, did get 2 pieces of the fried chicken. Superb - one of my new, guilty pleasures. NOTE: Wiped a good portion of my crusty hangover away too.

Service was stellar also - came on a Sunday and they were packed! 

Very warm/comforting dining experience! Felt welcome here and like I was sitting in my gramma's kitchen. Left Lo-Lo's feelin' fat-n-sassy!"}
{"text":"Their food is outstanding. The waffles are golden brown and buttery and the chicken is seasoned perfectly. One of my favorite late night spots. Service could be a little better, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Yes, your heart will hate you for the next few months, and you may not be able to come back here for a while out of fear of having a coronary, but this place is amazing!  Mmmm...fried chicken, waffles, mac and cheese, red velvet cake, and the Kool-Aid in the mason jar.  Far better than Roscoes!  And if you're lucky you'll spot a few Cardinals players.  I've seen some DE from the Cardinals when I was down here."}
{"text":"Went to the Lo-Lo's on Scottsdale Road and it was not a pleasant experience. Got seated right away but took 20 minutes for the waitress to take our order. 45 minutes after the order was taken, the waitress came back and told us the waffle maker was broke and it would be another hour.  She offered us biscuits that she would not charge us for. We also ordered omelets. That took another 20 minutes and only 1 order out of 2 came out. It took another 10 minutes for the other order.  The omelets were great but the rest of experience was horrible. Probably won't go back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite lolo's location! The fact that I'm willing to drive from chandler to downtown Phoenix just to get my soul food fix , tells you this is damn good dinner baby.
I had the shrimp and grits ($15) phenomenal! The shrimp were jumbo and cooked perfectly. The grits were topped with shredded cheddar cheese , bacon ( real hunks of bacon people) green onions and a dusting of some sort of creole seasoning. I was dying to lick my bowl once I was done eating !!
My mom had the 3 piece fried chicken with 2 sides (rice and gravy & potatoes and gravy) and a corn muffin. The chicken was seasoned and fried to perfection .. my mom insisted that the corn muffin was the best she's ever had . She said it was cake like and sweet.  Drinks are served in mason jars so there is almost never a need for a refill. Service is great, ambiance is gorgeous, and all the staff seem friendly and menu knowledgeable"}
{"text":"This might be the best chicken skin I've ever had. It was so flavorful. I went in on a Friday for breakfast and got the chicken and waffle. And I am still thinking about their amazing chicken skin. The meat was good but their skin had the best seasoning I've ever tasted. The waffle had a certain spice to it (cinnamon, I believe) that also made it very tasty. 
Their parking lot is pretty small, I can see it being difficult to find parking on weekends. Their service is super friendly and the decor is nice. 
If and when I'm back in Phoenix, I would love to come back !"}
{"text":"I went to put in a takeout order for postmates. They were putting take out orders so fast I was really impressed. Especially with a busy dining room."}
{"text":"Virtual clap to the new innovative location. I've been a frequent diner since Lolo's first started and boy is this a huge in step representing success. The new location is very trendy with a sports bar type of venue. As soon as you walk through the door your'e immediately greeted by a friendly hostess. I chose the bar area which is built for seating inside and out. Since the weather was nice I dined outside. The full service bar offers not only Lolo's famous fixins but some tasty adult beverages to help wash them down. Now if your a sports fan there are big screen TV's to keep you entertained that can be seen inside and outside the venue. What is nice is the full size patio is perfect for large parties. There is even a fire pit with seating around it for those cold AZ nights. 

The menu has more to offer. You can still get all the same great favorites along with some new options. Yummy appetizers, mouth watering burgers, crisp salads and much more. The only issue I have with the restaurant is what should I choose. With so many delicious things to choose from I want to be greedy and order it all.

I highly recommend this restaurant for not only dining for a great meal but perfect place to take out of town guest. The location is perfect as it is right in the heart of old town scottsdale."}
{"text":"Never a bad experience.  Always leave full and satisfied.  Today's visit we were greeted by the extremely nice and personable chef. The mac and cheese was beyond delicious and chicken and waffles never disappoint!! Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in the valley. Love the waffles and the cornbread is fantastic. I'm not even a fan of grits, but I order them almost every time I go here. 

The staff is very helpful and friendly. They come and chatted with us and gave us some recommendations. 

Not a big fan of the kool-aid, but other than that, everything I've tried has been great."}
{"text":"I am just looking to my right... as I write and I just saw \"better that Roscoes\"... Not a chance...  But is good no doubt.  The problem is the chicken.  The chicken at Roscoe's is what one would describe as an addictive experience.  It's Crack... Once you have it you can quit.

Back to Lolo's.  Nice place.  An improvement over Roscoe's in terms of the place.  Very colorful and big jars of Kool-Aid.  The chicken and the waffles are good... That is if You have never been in LA and had roscoes.

The breading of the chicken is dry and different.  The waffles and the syrup are great.  Need to improve the chicken thing.  I sure will be back as is definitely better than some fast food chicken but it ain't no roscoe's.

Ok in case you are wondering about Roscoe's.

{"text":"So far no chicken and waffle place has been that good (lo-lo's, roscoes, home of chicken and waffles).  There chicken needs a little more kick to it... The red rooster helped but my moms chicken is way better... The grits could have used some more salt also... The service was really good but the prices were kinda high but that seems to be the thing with chicken and waffle places I guess... High prices for something that can be done at home  for a fraction of the price.  It wasn't bad but then again it wasn't great also... Roscoes is better in my opinion and they offer more..."}
{"text":"Im Baaack ! I did go back to Lo-Lo's and this time brought my wife along. So here is the new update.:

The Sweet Tea is TAYS-TEE. The oil was clean tasting but I am still just not loving it. I want too. The Grits hit, still wish they had cream of wheat and the cheesy onion eggs are sooo damn good. I am not a fan of the fried chicken though and still prefer Krusteez waffles. It looks like they now have Grape Kool-Aid so if they could get this chicken right we might have winner, winner chicken.......well you know. Please Mr. Lo, I need crispier chicken and a waffle that is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Without that good crust on my Ghetto taco it becomes to mushy once I add my syrup and louisiana hot sauce. I will try again but since I don't consume food like this on a rgular basis it will be awhile. Look, I returned a few months ago from New Orleans and had some of the best fried chicken I have ever had. I want that here because I am in NO HURRY at all to go back to New Orleans...that city is a DUMP. Great, Great Food though."}
{"text":"Of course the food is good, there is something for everyone here. If you like good southern cooking, Soul food, then this is a place for you. Fried cat fish, Fried chicken, fried everything."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I want to write about the Poetry on First Friday from 7/7. There was a poet there. She reminded me of actress Samira Wiley. I didn't get her name, but I hope she reads this. I liked her poem. It was about regretting saying \"I Love You\" in the heat of \"the moment\" when you didn't really mean it. I liked her words. I think she's good. She just needs to slow down, and recite it with the passion in which she wrote it. I'm sorry she didn't get the reaction she wanted from the crowd. In all honesty, the dinnertime family rush is probably not the most appreciative crowd for her genre. She talked about grown-up subject matter in a crowd of parents and kids. It understandably made them uncomfortable. To the poet, please keep at your art! Find a better venue, but definitely don't give up. 

So, the food was great. Nothing fancy, but definitely satisfying. My husband got a bacon burger, and he didn't complain, which is HUGE for him. My 5 year old had never had banana on a pb&j, and he loved it. He's been asking for them ever since. The other kiddos ordered mac and cheese, and loved it. 

I had the chicken and waffles, and what's not to love? And, you can't go wrong with Kool-aid. 

Great atmosphere. Great for kids. I would stick to dining during daylight hours at this location. There was a not-so-undercover cop posted up right in front. I mean, I felt safe inside, but the neighborhood is a little skeevy."}
{"text":"We checked out this spot while visiting Phoenix and boy was it delicious! They have a really cool menu with fun to read entree titles. Also they servin' up the Koolaid at this joint, and they have Pepsi- that's a plus for me! I definitely recommend, I tried the traditional Lo-Lo's chicken and waffles. Very good!"}
{"text":"I have been in love with Lo-Lo's since I went there for the first time a few years ago.  I just enjoy the overall experience and the delicious food.  My favorites are the chili and corn bread, chicken salad, the candy sweets, okra, mac and cheese, and the banana pudding and red velvet cake.  I have introduced several other people over the years to Lo-Lo's and they have all loved it as well. Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was a phantom for months for me.  My family lives down in Arizona and I'm up in the Seattle area.  Every time that I went down there it would be closed and I refused to go to the Scottsdale location.  I wanted the original =) After about 5-6 attempts to get here I finally made it.  I ordered KK's (3pc chick, giant waffles, grits, and eggs) and let me tell you.  I beasted up that whole plate solo and did not regret the caloric intake at all!  I'm only sad that there is nothing similar to this in Washington State =(   Service was so-so but you don't go here for service!  Jar of drank is awesome too"}
{"text":"They've come a long way since the small corner restaurant where we ate elbow to elbow.  Incredible atmosphere, ambiance.  Love the room covered in family photos in the Southside location. Scottsdale location is cool too but I'm sentimental about the evolution of the South Mountain Village and Lilo's contribution to that ;-)  Proud of our neighborhood family restaurant.  Great food and drinks!!!"}
{"text":"I could get drunk on the grape koolaid any day! And don't get me started on the cheese grits, or the reason for our trip...the chicken & waffles! I love this place. What a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon just before the evening rush. Enjoyed the Smothered Chicken w/ Onion, MacNCheese, Collard Greens, Sweet Potatoes, & Corn Bread! Yum!! It was all pretty good, buuuut the Gravy for the Smothered Chicken could stand for a tad bit more seasoning & the Sweet Potatoes could've been a tad bit sweeter & everything would have been perfect! Oh & the Kool Aid I ordered had a fizzy taste to it...not quite the homemade Kool Aid taste that most are accustomed to. But overall it was good!"}
{"text":"The food was great! The people that work there are very friendly and gave us great service!  First timer at this  place but not my last! Try it you'll  like it!  Waited a little long for our food to arrive but hey good food takes time."}
{"text":"I've tried takeout from Lo-Los before.  I guess I'm not really a fan of the chicken/waffles combination, but both were very well made and tasty.  I'd recommend it if that's your thing."}
{"text":"I love this place, I mean I have never eaten at the famous Rosco's Chicken and Waffles so I guess I do not have the experience of the gold standard to compare it to. I have bee to both locations in Scottsdale and in Gilbert. The Gilbert location is nice and quaint but can feel costa phobic in the dinning area. Get there at a reasonable time, specially on the weekend or expect a wait. The Scottsdale location in Old Town Scottsdale is awesome, spacious nice bar with out side views and for some reason the food at the Scottsdale location is better, same recipe but better taste for some reason at the Scottsdale location. I highly suggest trying it out if you are a chicken and waffles person like myself and the coolaide is to die for, I suggest the \"red,\" yes it goes by color not flavor."}
{"text":"Visited with a small group. Was scared by the look but the food was fantastic. Everyone at my table got something different and it was all good.  Drinks are really good and pack a nice punch. The only thing they could have done better is to clean promptly after each table left. The wait staff was friendly and attentive and I actually let our waitress pick out my meal which was right down my alley."}
{"text":"Terrible service, didn't have legs, food was wrong, and got checked in on once while sitting at a table for 2 hours."}
{"text":"I can say I got me some soul food in Arizona! Oh yes, I did! Fried chicken and waffles to be exact! It was my first time trying this combo and I'll have to say that it was quite interesting. I didn't find chicken and waffles as appealing together compared to having each separately though. 

- Tre Tre's: 2 chicken legs and a waffle. Oh my, oh my, was the waffle big. Loved the fried chicken, so flavorful and not dry at all. Waffle was really dense and too filling, also flavored with cinnamon? 
- Buttered corn (served sat/sun only): I pictured a cob of corn, but it came out in kernel form in a bowl. It was like canned corn with butter melted onto it. :(
- Collard greens: Yum, with a hint of spiciness. 

After quickly scanning their menu and placing my order, I found out later that they serve cornbread and red velvet cake. Nom, nom, nom...but I was too full to even think about ordering either. It's a spacious restaurant, no wait for a party of 8 or so on a Saturday afternoon when I came. I would come back for the fried chicken, but I'll pass on the waffles next time!"}
{"text":"Missed the chicken & waffles experience when I lived in the South, so thought I'd try it here.  Scottsdale location's interior was equivalent to places I'd visited in Dixie, so that was a plus.  Portions are huge--I left stuffed.  Fried chicken was very, very good--probably some of the best in Phoenix.  Waffles were OK--not pancake house or diner-style--more of the deep South version--sweet and cinnamony but soggy throughout.  Everything tasted great.  Service was really mediocre.  Waitress was clearly new or in training and not very focused.  There was a gent who was somewhat \"supervising\" her and, in some cases, doing her job for her.  Wished he had accommodated us--but no such luck.  Not too long of a wait on a Sunday morning--which leads me to my next point--for the entire 1.5 hours we were there they were not playing music; they were blaring a Southern gospel-choir church / revival / worship session over the stereo.  Not saying that this was bothersome from a religious standpoint; having lived in the South I've been to some of these church events and they are great.  When they are done, the folks all go out and eat and if someone is playing they are playing MUSIC!  They don't drown out their eating time with more and more church items.  Not sure if this is just a Sunday morning ritual at LoLos, but I wasn't there as a substitute for church and listening to this for all that time was really pretty grating.  Don't think I'll go back--but it was a decent dining experience!"}
{"text":"WHEN I SAW \"JACKIE BROWN\"...
and Samuel L. Jackson (Q: what's the \"L\" stand for\" in Samuel L. Jackson?) gets a very skinny time-gone-by Chris Tucker in the trunk of that dirty ass car by the promise of, and I just guessing here, \"Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles\"...and since that time I've meant to go to Lo-Lo's.  And I just never made it until now.

When I saw a gorgeous fried chicken breast from Lo-Lo's at a D-backs game, but at $8, and that's no misprint, that's EIGHT DOLLARS FOR A SINGLE CHICKEN BREAST, I thought, well, now it's time to go to Lo-Lo's because I do want to try it but not at $8.  1/2 that outside the ballyard. 

This week, June 2015, I got down there and I know 3 things to be true:

*1:  Really, really good chicken breast. I got a #8: one breast, waffle, $8.  One breast on the side, +$4.  Moist, very juicy. see photos.  Very, very good.

*2:  Mac & Cheese is crazy good.  I will never again eat Kraft; it was only passable to ghetin with but now I'm spoiled, absolutely delicious.  $4, a small portion, I'm guessing 4oz, so good it doesn't matter the size.  Very, very good. 

3:  $7 FOR A 10 OZ BEER IN A 12 OZ GLASS IS JUST...unexpected. TOO MUCH!  CRIMINAL.  NFW!

You can make the case that I should have looked at the menu.  But here in America, we come to expect certian things. and a $7, 12 oz beer that really was poured so much earlier, the head had disappeared and it was really 11oz, not that cold, SEVEN FRICKING DOLLARS! for a draft beer is out-friggin'-rageous!!!!

I'd go back but I'll stop at Hazelwoods for a good, cold beer, priced like we expect it to, then I'll go eat the chicken.  

Go, enjoy, just don't get the $7 beers."}
{"text":"The line/wait can be really long, but the chicken and waffles with syrup is worth it!  It is not healthy, but it is tasty!  Big portions. Parking can be a little tricky.  It's casual, but a favorite of my teenage son every time we are in Phoenix, and no one else in the family complains!"}
{"text":"I went for the first time 6/26/14 and everything was absolutely fantastic!  The food was great... I had the chicken strips and waffles with a side of mac & cheese... it was so delicious... I had the red kool-aid which was so good... sweet and tasty... then I enjoyed the  best banana pudding I've ever tasted...  I cannot say enough about the food... as it was coming out  for other customers it looked fresh and they offer  a great portion size for the price.  

The service was also great... the hostess was nice and accommodating when we wanted to change to a bigger table... our waiter was one of the twins and he was sweet and made sure we enjoyed ourselves... they had a shift change while we were there and it went smoothly... The manager came by to check on us... it was just awesome hospitality.

The atmosphere was so great we stayed for about three hours and was free to eat and fellowship in peace without being rushed.... I cannot wait to go back..."}
{"text":"This spot takes me back to my time in The South.  The waffle was good, but not the best (that honor belongs to Matt's Big Breakfast).  The chicken, on the other hand, was fantastic and a pleasure to eat.

Aside from that, I got the Mac n' Cheese and the Collard Greens.

Mac:  some of the best traditional MnC I've ever had.  If you want a fancy one, then try the one at the Yardhouse in Scottsdale, but I digress.  The MnC was as dense as a brick, and it was super, super cheesy.  

Greens:  very good, well flavored, but they were served with a bit too much liquid.  I like a little bit drier, but they still had great flavor.  An excellent complement to the chicken, waffle, and MnC.  

note:  try mixing the syrup with a little bit of hot sauce.  Do this on the side and dip some of your chicken in it.  Sooooooooooo good!!!"}
{"text":"We are big fans of the Phoenix Lo-Lo's but this time we were staying in Scottsdale.  It did not quite measure up.  The service was friendly, but slow and forgetful.  My son had to ask for the ranch dressing that came with his meal 4 times.  The rest of us were nearly done before he started.  The portions are generous and the chicken is very good, but this location is not quite at the level of the other one.  The lemonade in a jar is worth ordering by the way."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in Scottsdale and in need of some comfort food, Lo-Lo's is the place.  I went with reluctance with my college age son who guaranteed that I would love it and he was right.

I had the \"Betty Boop,\" which consisted of a chicken breast cooked perfectly with a light breading and two waffles.  Yes, the breakfast kind.  I put syrup and butter and then ate the chicken with it.   All of these flavors melted perfectly in my mouth and my mouth said, \"more please!\"  We shared a side of rich and creamy macaroni and cheese and needed the mason jar of ice tea to wash it all down.   My son had the Cherry Kool-Aid and it was delicious too.

The service is impeccable and as a bonus everyone who works there is happy and beautiful too.

I live in Tucson but can't wait to go back when I need some real comfort food."}
{"text":"This review breaks my heart. 

A few friends and I met up at the down town location, I was excited to see that the newly renovated and expanded LoLo's was now open for business! It is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!! 
That's about where the love ends with this review sadly. 

We were waiting for one other friend to arrive, they would not seat us until he was there, I have never had this issue at Lolo's. But wait we did. 

When we were finally seated the waitress took our food and drink order. 10 minutes goes by, no drinks. She comes to our table and says they are our of glasses and we have to wait for clean ones. We asked her if she could just put them in to-go cups, we didn't need the mason jars, she says sure. 10 more minutes go by. Finally out come our drinks, in mason jars. OI. 

Next up is the wait for the food. We literally waited an HOUR AND A HALF for our food to come to the table, and I believe the only reason why we got it then was because we had complained to the manager. The table that was seated 10 minutes after us, got fed up and left at about the hour 15 mark and walked out. A table next to us who had received their bill sat and waited a solid 20 minutes just to pay the dang thing! Our waitress completely ignored our table and section the whole time we waited. There were not even drink refills in that 1.5 hour wait. NOTHING. I got up and found a waitress and pointed out our table at the hour mark and asked how long the food wait was, she said 40 minutes, when I told her we were already well passed that she said she would find out what was going on. Nothing. Then our waitress walks by our section at the hour 15 mark we ask her what the hell is going on, we get no real response. FINALLY we are at 1.5 hours and we are ready to walk, our friend goes and finds the manager and asks him whats going on and to please come talk to us. 2 minutes later the manager comes to our table with food! Yesssssss only its wrong, BOO :( They delivered 2 orders of stupid fries to the table, when we told him we only ordered one he said well we are just going to throw this away so keep it, which I am glad we did because it was going to still be a while for all the food to come out correctly. My friends order was the veggie plate, 2 of the 4 sides were wrong, then they tried to deliver the same wrong veggie plate again. She finally gets all of her food. meanwhile myself and a friend are STILL waiting for ours. Then he gets his and the manager says so that's it right??? Ummmm no...how about bringing the pregnant lady her food, eh? 
My food finally materializes and I am happy. The tell me that they are out of french fries but that they just cut up some potato's and made some fries, fine by me. My friend ordered the catfish and specifically asked the waitress for malt vinegar, she brings him out a cup of white vinegar....who does that? 

Ive been to both locations plenty of times and have never had this type of experience. It was seriously the worst....and to top that all off when our bill came there wasn't one bit of a discount on it, after all of that, everything we had been through, nothing. we were pretty disappointed in how the staff handled themselves. Not cool Lolo's, not cool at all. I think its rad that you expanded, but if you cant handle the customer load then whats the point?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here a few times. Food is always great. Huge portions. Always want to try the banana pudding but I never have room after. I usual get chicken strips. I love the way they cook their green beans and I always get mac and cheese. My boyfriend usually gets the fish and he always orders extra sides. Mac and cheese and green beans he says are good as well. He ordered yams and said they were only ok. One thing to keep in mind is that if you get extra sides your bill tends to add up fast so be careful! Price is worth the quality of food though :)"}
{"text":"I took my cousin from Pasadena to the Scottsdale location and the service was horrible! I had to keep asking the waitrss for things and finally she just stopped coming to our table. Yes I understand they were busy ( Full of white people ) and they had to focus on the other guest but what about us? My cousin asked for the waffles with the whipped cream and strawberries and the waitress asked if she was sure? I assume she asked cause my cousin is overweight !! We got the meal without the cream and strawberries and took the hint. We paid and left and will NEVER RETURN!!"}
{"text":"Today, I was very disappointed by the rude reception I received at the Central Phoenix location.   This employee brought it to my attention in a very harsh and annoying way that I used the wrong door.  I had read reviews about the Scottsdale location.  Customer Service is not favorable.  I will never spend money here again."}
{"text":"Went to Lo-Lo's for lunch and loved the Mac and Cheese. Of course the Chicken and Waffles were delicious. The staff was super friendly. The only complaint was the lemonade was so sweet I only took one drink. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I don't get it? Is this supposed to be delicious soul food? Its a crap piece of chicken and a crap waffle on a plate for 8 bucks. The water is from the tap. I expected delicious, I got below average at best. Back to the real restaurants for me."}
{"text":"This has to be the best fried chicken I have had since I had my grandfather's fried chicken growing up back in the hills of Kentucky. I couldn't go the waffle (just too much food) but the chicken was great as were the mac&cheese and the string beans with red potatoes. Paid extra to have a breast to take home the next day - it was even better the next day! And the bottle of beer served in a brown paper bag was a nice touch.

The place is BUSY so plan for that. We were a large group and service was still very attentive and made sure we were pleased with everything. If you have to wait for a table, do it, it will be worth it. This is about an hours drive for me but I plan on making this at least a monthly date."}
{"text":"Outstanding service (Thx LeeAnne)
Treat yourself to the smothered chicken, mac and cheese, peach cobbler. 
Be prepared to wait for this quality plus quantity  cooking.  Oh  yeah, you will leave happy and full."}
{"text":"Okay, I know this place has been yelped 99 times before me, but I just have to say how much I LOOOOOVE their waffles!!!  I've been there about 3 other times prior, and today was no different!  On this particular day I had the #10 which is two legs and a waffle, and then I had a side of mac and cheese.  As with every other time I'd been here, they did not disappoint.  The chicken was on point, crispy and well seasoned, the mac and cheese was oooey gooey cheesy goodness, and the waffle was oh so scrumptious!!!  They're light and fluffy, they have a hint of cinnamon, the butter they put on top is also fluffy, and the syrup is served hot.  It's orgasmic!!!  So if you want some bomb chicken and the best waffle you've ever had in your life, go to Lo Lo's Chicken & Waffles!!!"}
{"text":"Boommm food. Their drinks soo good homemade lemonade. Got me hooked on the cornbread.... Everything is good here and tasty Mac n cheese chicken everything. Try the tenders"}
{"text":"OMGoodness!!! I loved their food. The chicken was so good and the waffles were OK. They could have been softer. I would come back again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"SOOOO Delicious.  I would have to say this is my new favorite restaurant. I'm so mad it took me this long to check it out. Lemonade is perfect on a hot day. The collard greens are AMAZING. You must try the collard greens.  One of the best meals I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"It's located on the SE corner of Thomas and Scottsdale, over by the right-in, right-out access off of Scottsdale.  Parking can be limited directly in front and it's hard to turn around since it's right near the entrance/exit to Scottsdale Road.  

We got there at 11PM on a Friday night and the staff was very welcoming and did not rush us at all.  Other people came in at 1130 or later and the same treatment to them.  I ordered the Lil Amadi with a thigh, leg, and waffle while my friend got 2 thighs with beans and rice and a side of smothered potatoes.  The chicken was fried crisply and had great flavor.  My waffle with syrup added some nice texture and sweetness to my meal.  My friend really liked his red beans and rice.  The smothered potatoes weren't that good as the value wasn't there for just a few potatoes with some onions and peppers in the watery gravy.  Refills on our large mason jar drinks were always there.  Overall, a good place to grab a different type of late night meal."}
{"text":"The food is great ! The service is eveen better! 

From the moment you walk in until the moment you leave,all  the staff members are courteous and attentive. 

I have visted lo-lo's twice and both times I've been served by the same waitress. She is so sweet and accommodating , and patient. 

Their kool-aid is bomb.com but def on the sweet side. so i order half lemonade.. And let me tell you that is so much better! 

Both times i have visited i've ordered the Shrimp Mac and cheese and is amazaballs!! 

Bottom line.. I love it here and i recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is a must go if you're visiting AZ! The food is great, where they get chickens this size I don't know but they are so good! We had a group of 8 they wouldn't seat us until everyone was there but it wasn't a big deal to me because we were the late ones lol. I had the toy toy two wings with a waffle, one of the wings ended up on the floor so the waiter brought us two more so I ended up with three wings!!! Waitstaff was super nice joking around with everyone but got the job done! I wish my waffle was cooked a bit longer but that is my only complaint ... good stuff LoLos!! 

No photo I eat it too quickly!"}
{"text":"It is just as one would think of when you would want some good food made from scratch daily with some of that quintessential homemade flavor and love.

When there are local food that defines the heart and culture of a city Lolo's would be a big part of it. Being that many of the high end and designer restaurants and their posh play on food and trends attracts all the attention and tries to monopolize the old town and south Scottsdale area. LoLo's brings you back to the good old basics and it's family base gives you that warm feeling that makes you feel good about eating there. 

The fried chicken is great, fried like no other and not like any fast food place. The portions are pretty generous so I hope to taste everything one plate at a time. 

The honey hot wings with fries!!! Yes please, thank you and I wish my basket was never ending."}
{"text":"Ordered the mac and cheese and one waffle (thought the cod and waffle would be a weird combo). Loved both! M&C was very cheesy and creamy and the leftovers were just as tasty. The waffle had a cinnamon twist that worked very well. The blue raspberry koolaid wasn't too bad, I liked the jar and the guy gave us to-go cups. I'd go back."}
{"text":"First time visiting the new location. Coming south on Scottsdale Rd, it took so long to turn onto Earll to get there. Whatever. I try and park and find out it's valet parking...why?! I can park my own car, plus it created a long line of cars waiting to have their cars valeted. We walk inside and the hostess tells us it'll be a 15 min wait, but it was only 5 min. We got seated and there were still crumbs on the seat. OKAY. We both ordered the soul food platter cuz it's more bang for your buck! Otherwise I would've paid $8 for mac&cheese and a waffle. Carl was a great waiter and let me order one salmon croquette and one piece of cod. With it, I got cornbread and my two sides. Great deal and yum food. I like that they offer breakfast all day so maybe I'll try their pancakes next time. 

Just get rid of the valet parking. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Went on my birthday,five of us. Promptly seated and ordered up my sweet tea. Three pieces of dark with waffle and okra! I felt like I was a grandmas table with a waffle on the side. The waffles was like moms used to make. I ate so much I had the itis for about 3hrs after all I wanted to do was sleep but it was so good. We all can't wait to go back the chicken is what good chicken should be. The sides remind you of a family cookout and are delicious.  Be careful you can become addicted. It's so good it's a far drive for me!"}
{"text":"Yesterday (Saturday) after taking part in the Walk to Defeat ALS our group of 6 decided to check out Lo-Lo's new location, right up the road from the old location that we tried once before and loved. 
We arrived at 11:30am and after searching for parking for 10 minutes (they share a small lot with a hotel) we finally found spots (sorry, I don't trust a $30k automobile with a kid who barely looks old enough to drive at the valet station). Unlike another reviewer, we were not warned we may be towed and had we been told, we would have left then!
We were told there would be a 30 minute wait- no surprise as there were tons of people there. We were told this was a short wait as people used to wait up to 2 hours at the old location. Didn't make us feel better, but decided to wait. At the time we were glad we did as we only ended up waiting about 10-12 minutes before being seated. 
About 5 minutes after we were seated, our server arrived to take our drink order. I think her name was Gina but may be wrong. She was very polite and had a great sense of humor. We ordered our drinks and because we had an appointment at 1 asked if we could order. Our party had 3 adults and 3 teenagers. The first teenager ordered a burger and , truthfully, was very picky about what she did and did not want on it. The server was patient with her and wrote down everything she wanted. Next was another teenagers turn... He didn't know yet what he wanted. Rather than skipping him and taking the rest of our orders (the 3 adults were already decided) she said she would grab our drinks, take the drink order of another table and be right back.  Over 10 minutes passed and she returned with some drinks. She had to go back to get the remaining and to exchange one of the teen's drink as it had lime in it (fancy adding lime to koolaid) and he was allergic. She mixed up the sweetened and unsweetened teas which normally no big deal but the teen who ordered sweetened received unsweetened and had already added sugar since it was bland. We didn't say anything. By the time 1:00 arrived (remember we arrived at 11:30, with parking and the wait it was about 10 til noon when we were seated- over an hour sitting there) half the table had finished their drinks and not offered refills and our food still hadn't come out. A table behind us had a similar experience and was complaining to the server. A table of 3 across from us had ordered about 5 minutes before us (and was seated about 5 min after us) and was almost finished eating when our server came out to apologize, saying the kitchen uses a new system for getting orders and there was an issue with the system and the kitchen is backed up. If they were backed up then why did some tables receive food and some did not?  We asked how long the wait would be as we were already late for our 1:00 appointment (thinking perhaps we would get it to go). She said she couldn't say. May be 5 minutes, may be 20. We appreciated her honesty but decided to go. We offered to pay for our drinks but she said we did not have to. We left, over 90 minutes after we arrived in the parking lot and without food! 
Obviously our biggest complaint is the wait. That is simply unacceptable. The lack of attention comes second. Any time we've experienced an unacceptable wait, the manager has come to apologize, usually offering to do something to right the situation. Not this time. There was nobody who looked managerial in sight. What a shame.  I live in Gilbert and was excited to hear about one opening up here soon. I will wait a month or 2 before going in hopes they work out their kinks and can offer a better experience. Sadly, I don't think we'll return to their Scottsdale location again."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at the Scottsdale location after taking our daughter to a concert. We paid our bill via debit and tipped the waitress in cash. It appears Lolo's participates in the same transaction fraud that a well know pizza chain does. Apparently it doesn't matter if you pay a tip in cash and cross out or put 0.00 on your signed receipt because the person closing will add whatever tip they want at the end of the night and think you're too stupid to check your account. We called the manager to complain and was told we had to drive back to Scottsdale 30 miles from our home to present our receipt before the bogus tip was removed. So much for customer care. We had to go through the bank to dispute the transaction. Don't trust the establishment unless you're paying in cash!"}
{"text":"I guess I'm spoiled by the food offerings in Houston, but I was just not impressed by Lo-Lo's.  One of my best friends used to visit Phoenix a couple of times a year to visit his then gf.  He always looked forward to eating at LoLo's.  So as soon as I picked up my rental car I drove straight here! It was a friday morning, but after normal breakfast time, so it wasn't that packed.  However, they only offered valet.  Which was very annoying.  It was complimentary but totally unnecessary.  

Once inside, we were seated immediately, their menu has a lot of options, which did get my gf, but for me there was no reason not go with one of the chicken and waffle combos.  

Their sweet tea is SUPER Sweet, so if you're not used to the south and sweet tea, be prepared to be overwhelmed.  My gf got the red velvet pancakes based on the picture, I tried to persuade her to get a chicken and waffle combo, instead.  Well she got it, and didn't eat past the 2nd bite.  They were pretty bad.

I got one of the biggest chicken and waffle combos, that came with eggs, grits, and I think 4 pieces of chicken?

So there was plenty to share.  The chicken itself, was just OK, the Breakfast Klub in Houston is much better.  The waffles however, were pretty damn good.  It tasted like there was orange flavor mixed into the batter?

But the price was just so much for simple southern food."}
{"text":"Great food wait times can get long. You can not call ahead and all of your party must be present before they seat you. The good is worth the wait time and the waitresses are awesome!"}
{"text":"After being told numerous times that a visit to Lo-Lo's was a must, I ate there for the first time last Saturday.  The restaurant was 3/4er's full at 3:00pm.  We were seated immediately by a very pleasant hostess.

The chicken was good albeit slightly dried out and the waffles were just OK; I've had better (try Perk in Scottsdale).  Of note was that our side order of grits was terrific and some of the best I've had; melt in your mouth good.  My wife loved the sweet tea.

Service was mixed.  Our order was taken promptly.  However, I had ordered a diet drink and after a reminder, the server finally brought it halfway through the meal.  No refills were offered on the water or drinks.  Had to request the check.    

Will give them another opportunity due to the other interesting menu options and the grits."}
{"text":"It would be awesome if lolo's stopped placing their adds on the windshields of cars in the Cityscape underground parking lot. How about you keep your hands and crap off our cars?"}
{"text":"We decided to make the drive over from our home on Central and Thomas to this location because we hoped for a less hectic, less of a wait and a overall more enjoyable dining experience. We definitely got that as well as the chicken and waffles that my fiancée love from Lo Lo's. Service was good, the bartender was nice and attentive. Got to sit out at the outside bar and enjoy the nice weather which was definitely a perk. Our go to chicken and waffle meals were delicious as always!"}
{"text":"OK I don't get it, what's all the hoopla about Lo-Lo's?!  All the kudos given, the ratings issued - where is it?  First off, it takes forever to get seated!  Second, the service at this (and maybe only) visit of ours, was atrocious - no good ole fashioned Southern Hospitality here... 'get you in, eat it up and go about your way' service technique!  No hellos, how are yas' or thank yous.  Third, the 'Southern-Style' Chicken with eggs, home fries and toast and their Betty Boob Chicken and Waffles along with the corn fritters were anything but 'Southern'!  From someone who knows and who's fave food is just that, it is not.  From our time in line waiting to be seated, through seating and departure the customer service (or lack thereof) was none existent, abhorrent, lackluster and downright appalling.  We were uncomfortable throughout what should have been at worst a reasonably enjoyable experience.  But overall our experience is bewildering and are stunned by it's popularity!  Unfortunately, Lo-Lo is a No-No for us."}
{"text":"best chicken in az so far. Love the tre-tre with added piece of breast. Mac and cheese is bomb. Hit up the kool-aid drank yo!"}
{"text":"As a southern cal resident, I know a little bit about chicken n waffles, this place was delicious. Staff was friendly and food came out fast. This is a must if you are in Phoenix, you won't be disappointed ."}
{"text":"If you love soul food, you'll love this!! My personal fave is the Betty Boop. It comes with a waffle and a breast. The portions are big, so bring your appetite! The chicken is out of this world good! The seasonings used are amazing. The sweet tea is to die for as well. You really can't go wrong here. Try the chicken tenders as well. Don't forget to try their grape draaannnk. Will always be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Having been here a few times, I have tried about everything on the menu. Everything is better than the last. The fried chicken/waffle thing is the BEST hangover cure in the universe. They have a beans/potatoes dish and mac and cheese to finish it off. The staff is not just attentive, they are INVOLVED. I have never gone there without having a deep conversation with one of their staff, often not my server. They are just social and upbeat.  They do limit you to two beers. Not that you need more. Just saying..."}
{"text":"My very first experience at LoLos. I have to say OMG! I love fried chicken and waffles but never went to a chicken and waffles joint. The only bad thing I can say about this place (which isn't a bad thing for them) was that we waited for over an hour to be seated. Probably because there were 10 of us. Server was on point, nice, and generous.  He was very sociable and it was overall a good atmosphere for me.  Food: Awesometastic (yeah that's my own word). They got kool-aid too. I will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Used to love love love this place. But the new menu is no substitutions and less choices.  I liked being able to add a piece of chicken a la carte but no more.  Will be here much much less often.
... Then it got worse. Never got the Side of chicken that was ordered until after meal was over. And then even got charged for it after they said they wouldn't. So won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great food!  Huge portions and many choices.
  My son had a chicken sandwich that looked like a Flintstone sandwich.  I had the lolos and grits were yummy and waffles have great flavor!  No room for dessert ever but everything is so good.We always leave stuffed and go home for a nap.  The only complaint I have is the table was served @different times.  So if you like starting together that's a problem."}
{"text":"i love me some lolo's. Best breakfast in town. I refuse to go to the new location, the charm of the Yuma st location makes this place, ok maybe it doesn't but it sure makes a great experience to get a great breakfast meal in such an unsuspected location"}
{"text":"If you ever find yourself in the Scottsdale area in Arizona, Lolo's Chicken and Waffles is the place to eat. I've gone to eat here multiple times and have had outstanding customer service each time. The servers are extremely friendly and created a very inviting atmosphere. As for the food, it is the most flavorful and succulent chicken I have ever eaten. The waffles taste almost like a churro and compliments the chicken very well when eaten together. I've also tried the Mac n cheese which is very rich but delicious. Another must have is the kool-aid. Served in a decorative mason jar it is the perfect beverage to cool down and enjoy! I highly recommend trying out Lolo's Chicken and Waffles!"}
{"text":"Great place ! Food was great , exactly what I expected , we were already planning what we would order on our next visit !! .. Prices are decent and you leave stuffed !! Be prepared to be in a food coma afterwards . Friendly staff . The place is always packed , line out the door most of the time so my tip would be to arrive a little earlier than you'd like ."}
{"text":"Well I wanted to write this review a week ago but unfortunately multiple sclerosis has been beating me down ever since my visit to Lolo's at the airport. 
Let me start by saying our visit to the airport was to see my boyfriend off to attend a funeral for his 13 year old nephew, so it was very under unexpected tragic conditions. I thought having dinner at Lolo's would be a good idea since he had never been there. I'm a big fan of the downtown Lolo's and frequent it often. I've never been let down by the downtown location in all the years I've been eating there. So I hyped the place up to him and thought I would send him off with a delicious dinner.
I'm embarrassed for Lolo's to be associated with this airport location. This is NOT true Lolo's. 
First of all let's start with how they were out of fried green tomatoes. Ok disappointing, but not a real big deal, I went with the cheese grits instead. They were also out of the banana pudding. The cashier Brittany said it would be about a fifteen minute wait for our food. Not a problem since we were there early enough for my boyfriend to eat then catch his flight. 
Twenty five minutes later our food was ready, but it was missing one of our children's chicken tender baskets. The cashier asked us if we were sure that we didn't receive it. We literally had to show her our receipt and the food we received even though she had just taken our order not even thirty minutes earlier. She swore they had made it, even though it clearly wasn't there with our other food, but said she would get another one started. Twenty minutes later we had our missing chicken tender basket. 
Now the chicken was great, but the waffles were soggy. Fries in the chicken tender basket were also soggy not at all crisp. The cheese grits were more like cheese soup, just runny and not at all good. But worst of all was my sons chocolate milk bottle had MOLD growing in it!!! 
I was horrified. Took it back up to the counter and Brittany offered to go \"find\" the manager. She came back a few minutes later with the manager Bill. Bill looked at the moldy milk bottle and offered another drink. I told him at this point I'm not interested in another drink, my concern is the mold growing in their milk bottles. Bill then offered to refund the $3.29 we had paid for the milk, mind you our total bill (for subpar food, service, and MOLDY milk) was $61.61. I explained to Bill again that my concern was not to be refunded $3.29, that doesn't not at all make up for our poor experience, my concern is the milk bottles they are selling have mold growing in them. Bill then tried to say maybe it was \"an ink mark inside the bottle\". At this point I literally had to let Bill knows that any idiot with any common sense could clearly see this is mold as it was hairy, white and green, clearly not at all an ink mark, not even close and how insulting.  I literally had to ask him to remove the other milks on the shelves and make sure they were not also moldy. 
I am so disappointed and embarrassed for Lolo's food and service at this location. Super bad experience, and after I had told my boyfriend how great this place was. I would give this zero stars if I could. I can't believe this is how they treat customers or run their business."}
{"text":"What can I say.. I got the #3 and a side of fried okra, It was good.   I tried my friends catfish, I'd have to say it was some of the best catfish ive had in a while.  I also sampled my other friends grits and rice and gravy.. MMM M.  The chicken was excellent, just the right ammount of fried and a great flavor, and the waffles were tasty.  As stated below, I wish the chicken pieces were a little bigger...but then it would hurt to finish my plate."}
{"text":"Great place to grab chicken and waffles.  My boys and I checked this place off to try while in DT Phoenix and arrive around 9:30 am. We had about a 15 minute wait for a party of 4.  We ordered two drumsticks and waffle for the kids to share, smothered chicken and waffles, and shrimp and grits!  All delicious!  Shrimp and grits were bursting with flavor, chicken fried perfectly and the gravy sauce just added to the flavor.  My little boy loved his chicken so much he ate it to the bone and I really think he licked it clean!

Hospitality here is excellent....you can tell all the wait staff here are attentive and everyone works super hard to please their customers.  Our waiter, Matthew gave us biscuits on the house because our meal was a bit later than expected!  Thanks a bunch.....those biscuits were fabulous!"}
{"text":"I tried this place after attending an event in downtown Phoenix after hearing about it from friends and family members. The atmosphere was relaxed and comforting, like what the real south attempts to make everyone in America believe (racism, poverty, white supremacy, and general social inequalities seem to be the true trend of the south). We were greeted promptly and seated equally as fast. Our orders were taken and we received our drinks in a glass jar while we waited. 

I ordered two drumsticks with a waffle. The waffle disappointed me as I like my waffle C R I S P and mildly fluffy on the inside, but their waffle was soft on the outside completely, as if it had been steamed after cooking or something. The chicken was moderate, not too seasoned (which is disappointing for me) but seasoned enough for me to not complain. The outside quality of the breading wasn't a sharp crispy like Popeyes chicken instead, like the waffle, it was soft. Overall it was good.

They also had an array of sauces and specialty hot sauce at the table. Service was excellent. The food was a bit expensive, around 10$+ depending on what you order. For my party of four, our total cost was around 80$. I would come back and try something besides the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Want to have a five-star experience, but it was just so busy yesterday morning that I think the food suffered a little so I may try to go at a less busy time... if that's a thing? We've heard rave reviews about this place so maybe that's the norm? 

Anyway. We went for my birthday breakfast around 11 and ordered Betty's Boob and Malaysia's Focheezy Juicy Hood Burger to kind of get a broader taste of the food. It was good, great even, but not perfect. For one, the chicken was a little dry and slightly chewy. Still edible and the seasoning was superb, but I wish the piece had been nice and juicy on the inside. The waffle was delicious. Wanted a little cruch on the outside there, but have no complaints about the taste at all. Together the chicken and waffles we very good. Then there was the burger which, same as the chicken and waffles, was very good all together, but the patty was more well than I ordered and needed some more seasoning. It was however a decently thick patty,  juicy and cheezy as the name states with lots of veggies and a tasty bun. 

Would return again, but like I said, at a hopefully less busy day/time. And wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone. :)"}
{"text":"32 mins before we even got our drinks?? Are you kidding me?!? I watched three people get seated before me and get their orders and food before me. Four different people have come out on the patio and we still have NOT even been asked for our drinks! We informed someone that we had not been served or even asked our order and then it took another 20 minutes. How can you not see someone sitting at a table with bright pink hair for 40+ minutes."}
{"text":"Service has slipped since they moved into their beautiful new building. Today was our third visit since the new place opened. We were seated quickly, but waited nearly 15 minutes before someone stopped by for a drink order, and nobody stopped in to check on us or refill our drinks once food was delivered.

As usual, the food was excellent and the staff was friendly. But despite what seemed to be dozens of employees roaming the floor, we felt like we were invisible. Lo-Lo's has been a regular in our weekend breakfast rotation for a few years now. Perhaps it's time to look around a bit."}
{"text":"Not for me. Apparently my money wasn't needed or wanted. I sat at the bar waiting... waiting...waiting... LEAVING. Can't comment on the food. Never spoke to anyone... One glared at me though. Maybe that meant \"hello, welcome\"!"}
{"text":"Two stars because the service sucks. The food is great. But you'll wait for it. 30-45 minute wait to be seated. 10 minutes before someone came to get our drink & appetizer order. 20 minutes for our appetizer to arrive and another 20 for the entrees. We spent a total of 2 hours there. And they don't care that the service sucks... Because the food keeps everyone coming back. It's that good."}
{"text":"Honestly the FOOD WAS PHENOMENAL!!! 

Ok here is the down - low.  Lolo's is known all over and people come here all the time to eat so I expect a wait.  When I got there at 11 am there was an hour wait, I expected that no big deal, and was told by the friendly staff that I can wait outside on the patio if I would like to wait.  Well I walk through the dining area to find at least 4 tables empty and ALL of the outside tables empty!  If you have an hour wait, why are the tables empty? I am assuming they were short staffed but still unacceptable for a place that always has a wait.  After waiting a little over an hour, we get our table.  We literally order our food once we sit down from our waiter Chris.  Chris was really nice and stopped by from time to time to check on us but it took 45 minutes to get our food - just unacceptable.  We literally ordered CHICKEN AND WAFFLES ONLY!  There were no added items, no speacialty items, just the norm.  Also, I noticed there were three tables that sat down after me and got there food before me.  I personally LOVE there food and thus the reason I brought a friend of mine here to eat but waiting 2 hours to eat chicken and waffles is crazy. 

I hope that they really work on staffing!"}
{"text":"The chicken was overcooked and dry. The waffles were nothing special. Sorry, I don't get all the hype about this place. Not impressed at all. No Jalapenos to go with fried chicken. I will not return. Service was good."}
{"text":"If you're craving comfort food...

Loved the waffles (thin, with warm syrup) and the chili-peppered fries.  Chicken was okay, kind of dry.  Not sure I'd go back for the chicken.  People seated at the table next to ours ordered the Mac & Cheese which looked oh, so gooey good.  My husband ordered Kool-Aid!  Kool-Aid?! I haven't had Kool-Aid since I was a kid but it was tasty and brought back good memories.

Beautiful new location.  Service was excellent.  Fun vibe.  Can get really busy, just so you know.

Next time, I want to come back for breakfast."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place every time we come to Phoenix, finally got a chance and I think they are very overrated. First of all the wait was over 45 minutes and there is limited seating for people waiting. I had the chicken and waffles, chicken was the highlight for me, but the waffle was very underwhelming. The peach cobbler was also a miss for me, I had the Lolo's punch, which was pretty strong but not worth the price. I will say our waitress was great and very friendly, but this is one place I will scratch off my list as go to spots in Arizona."}
{"text":"The seafood grits were amazing and a huge portion. I also got the chicken & waffles. The chicken was seasoned well but the waffle was nothing to sing about. The kool-aid was delicious! I would go back to the restaurant just for that."}
{"text":"To some people, myself included, the concept of chicken and waffles originally sounded absolutely ludicrous. Then you try it and immediately realize that you still have much to learn in life.

I've always been a big fan of LoLo's for many reasons. First, above all else, their fried chicken is top notch in terms of quality and consistency. In fact, their fried chicken is so good, that it beats out a handful of more upscale joints that shamefully charge more money for an inferior product. Make no mistake, Lolo's does chicken extremely well!

The waffles, on the other hand, are just okay. I'd describe them as soft and flimsy, with a slight cinnamon flavor to them. They're not quite as good as some of the waffles offered at local breakfast joints, but I suppose they're passable.

I've tried several sides over the last few years, including grits, mashed potatoes, and mac and cheese. All are pretty well done and reasonably priced. Their menu, featuring various ghetto call-outs, is quite amusing, even though I'll probably never try most of the stuff myself. Their cornbread used to be my favorite of all the sides. It's still very good, but they recently changed the recipe that now includes actual corn kernels inside. This is a matter of personal preference, but I much prefer the old way.

I insist on ordering Kool Aid. Perfect for an intense sugar high, it's the same classic stuff that will permanently stain your clothes and temporarily dye your upper lip - just like the old days!  

We've always wanted to try the desserts here, but we're just so damned full after our meals, that we couldn't possibly order anything else.  

While not everything on the menu is flawless, it's good quality and it's cheap. I have very little to complain about and for that, I give it a strong recommendation!"}
{"text":"I am hesitant to give a review for this restaurant due to the fact of how crushed I am! I was expecting an out of the world experience because of how highly this place is raved about. 
My significant other and I were seated at such a small table that could barely fit our drinks on it. I had to set the hot sauce and sugar packets on the floor due to the fact that the table was built for toddlers. Our food arrived thirty-minutes after we ordered from our waitress, Alexis. She was sweet but did not tend to us much. She gave us two straws, that we dipped back and forth in between the water and kool-aid. She simply, took our order, and gave us the check. 
The food was not as wonderful as expected. The chicken tasted like any other store bought chicken. As well as the waffles. They were hardly flavored wheat waffles. The only plus about our experience was the kool-aid. It was super sweet and delicious. It tasted like a melted Popsicle in the summer time. So yummy.
All in all, we felt so crammed at our table we asked for boxes to go immediately. Arriving to this restaurant with a big appetite and leaving with a broken heart and empty tummy was not fun! 
However, I will have to come back in future to grab another kool- aid drink and give it another go. For now, my significant other and I wasted fifty dollars on a sad meal. What a bummer."}
{"text":"I've been to Lolo's downtown Phoenix location many times, and I wanted to try the Scottsdale location to make sure they have some consistency going on.  Everything was great, the service is great, the portions were huge (like I expect from Lolo's) and the chicken and waffles were greasy and buttery enough to harden my arteries. However, I will say this; there is something about going to this Scottsdale location that just doesn't..... well.... feel right.  I can't quite put my finger on it though -- maybe, it's just that I'm used to their location in a more \"questionable\" neighborhood versus the slightly upscale feeling that I get from Scottsdale.  Maybe it's that the Scottsdale location doesn't feel as cozy because it's in a strip mall and you are not sitting  crammed together with other tables like you are in the Phoenix location.  I don't want to stop you though.  Bottom line:  the food is great, and the service is quick, and it's still Lolo's... so get over there and get your chicken and waffles on!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this isn't the best chicken and waffles I have had.  I would rather go to Waffle House & Popeyes but then I would have to make two stops and who wants that.

Roscoe's has them beat hands down but since there isn't a Roscoe's here LoLo's will do.  

There is a breakfast spot at the corner of 48th st & Indian School who offers better chicken and waffles if you have a craving."}
{"text":"The service was good from start to finish...and....they sell adult kool aid. The biscuits were good. Didn't have the cornbread but my friends enjoyed it.

The chicken was seasoned just right and not under or over cooked. The collards were good. The shrimp and grits had mushroom and bacon in it. Different, but tasty. The waffles have a cinnamon taste. Pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is definitely not over hyped! We ordered stupid fries, mac and cheese and the #3 and shared it all. Everything was so delicious! I highly recommend the mac and cheese! Kool-Aid to drink of course!"}
{"text":"The food was not anywhere good enough to make up for the lack of service. After waiting 20 min for our waters we had asked for, we asked again and were told that we hadn't receive our waters yet because \"the proper water glasses weren't finished being washed\" our server proceeded to try and memorize our very short order. Shouldn't have been too hard but we received the wrong sides. I will not be coming back here. Very disappointed after hearing all the hype."}
{"text":"The chicken/grits were pretty good; wasn't a difficult order so it wld be unfortunate to mess 2 thgs up. The wait was lil ridiculous though, took abt 45 mins for the food to come. I'm not crazy abt the expanded menu from the original Lolo's on Yuma St downtown in that small shack (that's when they were on their A game) still decent but def don't go near as often."}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles is legitimately not a bad pick if you ever find yourself stuck in PHX on a layover for whatever reason.

Among the top chicken and waffle joints in the United States, Lo-Lo's is often mentioned among them, and for good reason. This is actually the recommended place of Charles Barkley, and he definitely knows his food, for better or worse. Normally, you wouldn't expect the same level of quality in its airport counterpart. I wouldn't know, since I haven't actually been to the actual place.

However, I can attest that the airport location satisfies the craving just as well. I decided to go with the Puffs Chicken Tender Basket, since I prefer my chicken boneless, and I wasn't let down. I got a few big pieces of chicken, probably one more than they were actually supposed to give me and a tasty waffle. Provided were syrup, butter, and BBQ sauce, all you really need to enjoy a good chicken and waffles dish. I found it very filling for a generous price of $11.95, which I find very good by airport standards.

One thing I'll note is that the sides are really pricey, and as much as I'd like some greens, I'm not paying over $5 for a side of greens. That's one big downer. Nonetheless, the entrees get the job done at just about the right price.

Another thing is that this location is before security, which is unfortunate, so I had to leave the security area to grab my chicken and waffles, but with a few hours to kill, it was well worth it, besides the slow security process back in.

TIP: Definitely get the waffles. I would recommend that with any chicken dish, whether you prefer bone or boneless."}
{"text":"Although I grew up in the South, my review has nothing to do with a comparison of food to my origins.  My girlfriend and I decided to try Lo-Lo's for the first time and here is our review.  

The positives:

1) Although I called for a take-out and did not eat inside, the restaurant looked very clean and classy.  I was very impressed.

2) Shrimp and grits.  Very nice!  Shrimp had great seasoning and flavor.  Really enjoyed the grits with its bits of bacon in it.

3) Pricing.  Not bad, reasonable. 
 
The negatives: 

1) \"Soul food meal, chicken smothered in gravy and onions.\"  Ugh.  There was so much salt in the gravy that I actually scraped off the gravy with a knife in order to eat the chicken.  Event the skin was grossly soggy and inedible.
 
2) The okra was not flavored or seasoned. Plus it was soft.  My impression was that is was microwaved. 

The mixed points:

1) The cornbread: it was more like corn-cake (delicious) but excessively smothered in butter (absolutely horrible for you).

OVERALL:  This was a once in a lifetime experience.  Meaning, I've eaten there once and will not again unless a client requests it.   And even if they do I'll recommend Dickey's BBQ."}
{"text":"Been to the Lo-Lo's in Scottsdale once a while back and it was just ight. Stopped in this location this morning and had a very tasty number 3. Everything was hot, chicken was good quality, service was nice. Clean restaurant and overall good environment. Great experience, will be back soon! Might make this a Friday morning regular stop."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to go to this place since my first first friday 2 years ago.  Well, I finally made it in.  Before I get into the reason for the missing star, I'll start with the 4 well deserved other stars.  The food here is good.  I love that I can order kool aid, that's just awesome.  The waffles are very tasty and light, not too heavy.  The barbecue sauce was very yummy too.  I wish they had a better ranch, but that's not gonna take away from the greatness of everything else.

The only qualm I had was a minor service issue.  My friends will all agree, I never vent about service.  I don't mind waiting (especially for good food) and if the food is great and the service isn't I will always come back. The problem with my experience was that the table that got sat after we did, had their drinks and was putting in their food order before we got our drinks (and it was the same server).  

It hurts me to gripe about something like this, but I needed to put it out there.  I will always tell my friends I had a great time here and enjoyed it all."}
{"text":"YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS FOOD. it's not as strange as you may think.  Ever have pancakes and sausage, french toast and bacon, why not chicken and waffles??  The sweetness of the waffles compliments the salty fried chicken so well, you'll wonder how you ever lived without this combination. It's  like dunking sausage in syrup...it'll seem strangely familiar and natural the first time.

As far as the food goes, this is the BEST SOUTHERN FRIED CHICKEN you can get in phoenix.  Even if you don't want or can't have (e.g. diabetes) the waffle, try this chicken.  It's real crispy on the outside with tons of moisture inside.  It is as good as it gets!

For all you cardio workout junkies, i am an avid bike racer and half marathon runner.  This place is the perfect spot for a recovery meal after a long workout. Plenty of carbs and lot's of protein (some fat blah blah blah) but after a long run...this is IT.  It's just fun to workout for a few hours with the thought of lolo's when it's all done.
I'll see you all there after the PF changs half marathon on Jan 16th! :)"}
{"text":"I come into town a few times a year. I was not happy with the service this past sunday. To make matters worst it was my birthday. My food was fine.  It was the service I received that was horrible. The young lady never came back to refill my water. And when the food arrived. I didn't get utensils to eat it with for almost 5 mins before the other young lady came back.  Once I finally was able to track down my waitress. I gave her my card and asked for a to go box along with a bag. She eventually came back with a container no bag.  I felt no tip was required since I still didn't have nothing to drink after sitting in there for almost an hour. I signed the receipt and I heard her say she didn't tip. Now why would I tip and it takes nothing to refill a baby size mason jar? It will be a while before I go back to this location again. Hopefully,  next time the service will be better."}
{"text":"Plan and sample Service Suck..... There's nothing to talk about. Bar tender SUCK even more"}
{"text":"Not bad...for just waffles and chicken.  The service was friendly, attentive, portions were decent.  Worth the visit."}
{"text":"valet parking, serious? 
Service was ok, 
I ordered 2 pieces of chicken and a waffle. The waffle was ok , nothing special to me but my cousin really liked it.
The chicken was great, one of the best. not sure ive ever had skin on a chicken like this. It kind of puffed up and separated from the meat and was delicious,"}
{"text":"My hubby and I were craving fried chicken last night.  I searched this Yelp app and saw that LoLos had great reviews so we gave it a shot.  Even though we walked in just 15 minutes before closing time we were given the best service and they didn't make us feel rushed at all.  All the staff were very friendly.  We had the chicken & waffles, of course, and I added a side of mac & cheese to mine.  It was wonderful.  I'm from Texas and know my southern food...the chicken was southern fried just like my mom used to make when I was a kid.  The mac & cheese had little pieces of mushroom and it was amazing! I couldn't stop eating it.  I have to say the thing that surprised me the most was when I saw Kool-Aid on the menu! Kool-Aid! I haven't had that since I was a kid... my hubby and I had a huge glass of the fruit punch.  This place rocks! It had a nice family atmosphere where anyone would feel welcome.  It was a great nostalgic evening and, for a little while, I felt like I was down south again.  We will definitely be back to try more of their delicious offerings."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! Besides the outstanding chicken and waffles, the candied sweet potatoes are my very favorite.  This time tried the fried green tomatoes, beans & rice, macaroni, bread pudding, and red velvet cake.  These were all fine, but still can't beat the sweet potatoes.  The red velvet cake was super moist, but lacked a richness of flavor.  Will try to get there in time to snag a slice of peach cobbler next time.  Staff were attentive and friendly.  Get there early to avoid a wait!"}
{"text":"I simply cannot believe I never stopped to eat here until now.  The chicken, waffles, candied yams, cornbread... Heaven on a plate!  Atmosphere has good vibe for casual sit down meal... Music was perfect too- I felt like one of my Pandora stations was playing.  Staff warm, friendly and helpful, just like being back home in the South.  Putting this place into regular rotation!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience and I've had a few there. Don't know why I keep trying it but do know I won't ever go back again. Every time I go there, I wait a long time for food but usually it does eventually come... this time, the food just never came. The waitress was nice at first but after waiting over an hour and 15 minutes for my food, I said to cancel our order and bring the check for our drinks.. she came and said that our drinks were free and not to worry about it and walked away with attitude like WE were the a-holes. No saying sorry you've been here over an hour and a half for nothing. Horrible horrible service, takes way too long for food that isn't even that good. I will never ever go back."}
{"text":"At first most of my noobie friends are very skeptical about the fusion of Chicken and Waffles.  but after taking them to this place and experiencing firsthand the divine taste of what they first believe was a anomalous combination, it made them change their Religion.

For lunch time I suggest that you get to this place as early 11AM since this place has a very limited sitting you can expect up to 2 hour wait. :("}
{"text":"I love the original Lo-Lo's in Phoenix for the atmosphere and the food. It's an irresistible combination. However, the Scottsdale location was exactly what I thought it would be. 

The food was still the same. My tre tre was as delicious as it has been every time before. The kool-aid is still filled to the brim in a huge-ass jar and the waffles make my mouth water before I even sit down. 

However, the change in atmosphere just makes it seem fake in my opinion. It's too new, the menus are too new.. our waitress asked us what she should try as she's never had any of it before... and Justin Timberlake was blaring on the speakers. 

Additionally, while this locale does take plastic rather than just cash, and even tho it divides up the bill when you look at it by seat, you cannot split the bill more then 2 ways. This will repeatedly cause an issue for my coworkers. Might as well only take cash.

This was definitely not Grandma's kitchen. It's close to work and good for those lunchtime cravings.. but my first choice is still good ol' original Lo-Lo's."}
{"text":"How can you not seriously love this place? For real. I dare any of you to tell me otherwise, and then I will make fun of you and call you lame. I've been to Lo-Lo's several times, and it's about time I inform everyone of their amazing treat of chicken and waffles. And the red kool-aid. Don't deny it. I don't care if you are 75. You still crave you some kool-aid every now and then. And now you can have it. With dinner. In a jar. And mom and dad can't even yell at you. 

The atmosphere and location are both real and authentic. Expect to feel like you are in grandma's house, sitting somewhere near the kitchen and waiting for some amazing southern food. 

I always want to try the red velvet cake or the mac and cheese but I can never get past the tre tre.... 2 fried chicken legs and a waffle and that's all it takes for my stomach to be full.

Be warned they only take cash here, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Southern food doesn't get any better than this. Comfort food at it's best!!! Went with my friend for dinner on MLK day... and who knew waffles and chicken go so well together. Don't get me started on the cool aid... Brought me back to when I was a kid with a red stained mouth after a big gulp if red sugary deliciousness! Highly recommend getting one of their many sides, especially their okra! 

This place is always busy, more so on the weekends. Work the wait in line :)"}
{"text":"The food was horrible...waffles were soggy and peach cobbler was cold catfish was soft and the service was horrible"}
{"text":"Well, here we are finishing up at Lolo's and had a bad experience. We've been here and Gilbert several times and not had a really bad experience until now. Waited 45 min to get cold food, missing items and dry burnt toast. I'll avoid this location in the future. Bummer."}
{"text":"Gotta love Lo-Lo's! I went here for the first time and was completely blown away. I drove about a 20 minute drive to get me some delicious chicken, and I will say, I'd do it again.

At first, the prices intimidated me. However, once I received my fresh lemonade and huge plate of waffles, chicken, and biscuits and gravy. 

Everything came out so fast, it was like I blinked and the food was in front of me. 

The atmosphere was great, our waiter was great, and the food was even better. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Just the facts.  Food average this time.  Seems not as good when they are busy.  Service was helpful and pleasant.  

Deal breaker.  After waiting in line for bathroom.  Employee in front of me exited.  Upon entering found unflushed deuce.  So, either he left it behind or failed to address before a customer entered.  

Will not be back."}
{"text":"Love the chicken and the waffles, but knocking off a star for the high priced drinks. $3.50 for Kool-Aide? $3 for coffee,tea, and soda......I've been to much nicer restaurants and been charged less."}
{"text":"The food was decent...chicken is juicy waffles are whatever Mac n cheese was good also and the service is great but the food isn't that good to wait 40 min. Honestly it's Over hyped, Would I be back probably not but makes a good Snapchat story."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere, but our server took a while to assist us. Everything that we ordered came in a timely manner, and looked very presentable. Would definitely come again, but request a different Server."}
{"text":"Love Lolo's, but they slacked off this morning. Food was a little too greasy for no reason (the eggs and grits), and had to get a scraggler waiter or we wouldn't have got served.... Hit the new Scottsdale location"}
{"text":"Omg. I love this place. Waited 47 minutes for a table and then waited more on food and worth every minute. 

Today had the \"stupid fries\". Wow. What a mix there. Then the chicken tender basket with a waffle and greens. 

I'm miserable full. Worth every bite"}
{"text":"Go to the one in Phoenix. Punk ass lady in the back closed the kitchen 1 hour before actual closing time and urged us to leave. I love Lo-Lo's but this was the worst experience. Didn't feel welcome at all. Shout out to Matt Waldman"}
{"text":"; I honestly wouldn't even have given them a one star. I'm SO angry about my lack of service. Came on 6/11/15 on a Thursday around 3pm, when there was no rush, & it still took about 30 mins or so to get even a look in the right direction. Took 15 mins to even get our drinks. Our food came out fast, but my plate got cold waiting for a side that I wanted to go w/my meal. Only was checked on one time as well. NOT a happy customer. As a server, I always give other servers breaks, but the over all service, was shit. I left a $4.76 tip on a $29.24 check because I understand shit happens, I just would not recommend going to that location. I didn't even bother to cause a problem, just will never get my service again."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect but I was impressed! I hadn't eaten all day and everything looked appeasing to me. I ended up getting the Mix and Match meal, a breast of chicken and catfish along with collards and Mac with cheese.  Delicious. The fish was fried hard enough that it didn't break into a million pieces and the breast was moist. I'm definitely hard on Mac with cheese from restaurants, but theirs was pretty tasty. Now the collards were probably my favorite. Very impressed! The serve kool-aid and it was pretty tasty as well. I had the tropical punch and lemonade mix. I'd definitely recommend Lo-Lo's"}
{"text":"Yo! Little sis graduated from ASU today.. So we came to Lo Lo's to celebrate. Diamond was our server and I can not remember a time when I had better service! Food was bomb. Diamond was super sweet, accomodating, and relatable. I hope the managers know what a commodity they have in Diamond. Probably won't be back to Arizona any time soon.... But when in AZ, this is definitely one of those restaurants that you MUST hit up. I am sure everyone else is just as kind and attentive as she was, but the next time that I am in town, I will be looking for Diamond."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience i've ever had. waited over an hour to be seated after being told 20 minutes, waited an hour to get food after we ordered, and then waited another half an hour just for the check so we could leave. Would leave 0 stars if I could. Very poorly managed and run"}
{"text":"Way too much food and more than a little unhealthy.  Greasy salty chicken, drinks were too sugary ... And yet all part of an experience you need to visit while in Phoenix.  BTW one order can feed 2 people easy.  DJ and atmosphere made it authentic."}
{"text":"Went with a group of twelve.  Six of us got our food after one hour.  The other six waited another 30 minutes for their food.  Everyone agreed the food was excellent, but the service was abominable.  The server never came over to ask if everything was OK.  It took three tries before they got my bill right.  Two other things we didn't like.  The original restaurant on this site was cozy with a couple of small rooms.  They have enlarged it, so the original ambiance is gone.  Also they had a DJ playing so loud that conversation was impossible.  Not likely I will return, even though the food is excellent."}
{"text":"I visited the Central location late in the afternoon when it was about half-full. The styling of the restaurant was modern and there was a good ambiance. We decided to sit on the patio and were seated promptly. 
We came hungry, so we started with chili cheese fries which came out promptly and were dressed with a good balance of cheese and chili. I ordered the waffle and fried chicken breast combo with a side a string beans. And I waited at least 30 minutes for it to arrive. The waffle was a bit soft, while I prefer my waffles crispy on the outside. The chicken and green beans, however, were spot on.
Lo-Lo's will be a go-to spot for comfort food, but the slow service will make me think twice about going."}
{"text":"I've had decent experiences with food and service both lunch and dinner. Food is flavorful and fresh! The red beans and rice is so delicious! Also, love the Honey Hot Chicken. If you want some southern cuisine, this is a good place to try!"}
{"text":"Fried chicken, waffles, and mac and cheese for breakfast, oh. hell. yes. Lo Lo's food is more than worth the wait, however I did feel kind of rushed when we were finally seated! I understand they wanna turn tables, but I just waited 45 minutes for a table, gimme a minute to decide what I want to eat! Despite the inevitable wait and the hurried service, I will most certainly be eating here again soon. Oh yes. I will."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice and both times I have gotten shitty service and bad attitudes. If someone doesn't like there job they shouldn't work there to begin with. The hour and a half wait wasn't the problem and not even the food. I ordered the Mac and cheese and phat ass sandwich the catfish the stupid fries just to get a feel for the place and let me just say they are losing they're touch ... Very disappointed. Don't recommend this place to anyone. Especially with such shitty service the girls have attitude rolling they're eyes in front of customers and smart remarks not happy at all. Corporate should be getting a call from me soon .."}
{"text":"Again, the best service around! The waffles are warm and fluffy, the chicken is crispy, and the banana pudding (which I tried for the first time tonight) was hands down the best dessert I've ever had. I'm already thinking about my next visit."}
{"text":"I had been eating at the Scottsdale location all my time in the valley, so decided to give the original a try. Lo-Lo's just recently moved into the building next-door, and the original shack has been bulldozed. While waiting for the rest of my group, I loved being able to watch the food being made through the window! Staff was super friendly and we were seated by Larry \"Lo-Lo\" White himself. I also really liked the atmosphere inside with the mason jar lamps and all. Looking forward to coming again when live jazz is being performed!

Now on to the actual food part. I ordered the #10 Tre-Tre's with a blue Kool-Aid. One awesome thing I noticed in comparing it to my experience in Scottsdale is that the chicken legs have waaay more meat on them. It's almost as if the meat on a breast at the Scottsdale location equates a leg at the Phoenix one. Definitely a good thing! The waffle was just as amazing as I've always experienced. I will be definitely returning to this spot.

Oh, and if you didn't read my review of the Scottsdale location, take my advice and ORDER THE BANANA PUDDING! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and it was packed so there was a half an hour wait but I was craving the chicken so I patiently waited the 30 long grueling minutes. The wait staff was very nice about it and came out frequently to seat people. There were outdoor seating areas that were empty that they should convert to dining spaces.
When we were finally seated, the waitress was perky and ready to help. We ordered our Jar of Drank first. The koolaid was a bit warm with lots of ice and the lemonade had a crystal lite flavor to it. I ordered the 3 piece chicken with two waffles and eggs with cheese and onions and a side of grits. I do not like grits so I traded it for fries but they gave me rice instead... (must have been the loudness of the place). The chicken skin is so delicious and crisp with the perfect amount of salt. When you add their hot sauce the flavor is divine. The waffles have cinnamon and are nice and fluffy. I can't say much about the eggs and \"fries\" (rice) because they were pretty standard. I loved the foods they are known for but I would skip the extras. The price is not bad for the amount of food and the experience was nice."}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles restaurant food look good. But I notice everytime on theses photo they have the best looking pictures of the food. But when you go to the actually restaurant in person it a different story. I wonder why that is?"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday around 11:00am.  I was looking forward to discovering Lo-Lo's having read several magazine reviews.  The place is on a nice corner location, lots of windows, bright, colorful, energetic feel. It was fun to peruse the menu.   The service was great that time of day, before the Friday lunch rush.  There must have been 10 employees who came up to us during our visit...extra napkins, replace a dropped fork, make sure we had a chance to order, any questions about the menu, asking how we liked it, and more.  Everyone was full of positive energy and smiles.

I discovered I like fried okra and the gravy for the chicken is A+.  The cornbread was the best I had had in a decade, fresh, moist, large, with a nice ball of butter on top.  I will try the cheesy grits next time.  The chicken was good, meaty.  Would like to try it when the noon rush is on and the chicken is piping hot like some of the other reviewers mention.  Chicken is crisper when it is just out of the fryer.  I would definitely recommend.  The full blown chicken dinner for lunch is $14. Comes with 3 pieces of chicken, 2 sides, cornbread, gravy, but one will have leftovers for the next day's lunch.  Other dishes are typical Scottsdale luncheon pricing.  Curious about the waffles...I am not big on waffles, but heard they are worth trying once.

Wish there were coupons to coax me there more often.  :)"}
{"text":"Great place and seems to be newly renovated.  It's very clean.  Chicken is crunchy and moist, corn bread is tasty, although waffles could be better (too soft and for me).  Drinks are sweet as they should be.  This place has a real southern feel to it and service is friendly.  They also have a live DJ."}
{"text":"I want to like this place so bad! The staff is usually pretty friendly, the atmosphere is great, the DJ plays great music, but the wait time to get your food is the worst in the business! I have been to LO-LO's on 3 different occasions and have NEVER received my order in under 1 hour!!! I hope the owners can turn this around. I can't recommend this place in the mean time."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious! The service sucks! The host seems to be very pleasant , but my waitress Celesta was horrible. Celesta literally took 15min to even give me water after being seated , I had to repeatedly ask for things she should have already had with her such as napkins , and straws i mean come on!!!! After speaking with her manager about her lack of service, she had an even worse attitude but i digress."}
{"text":"First and last time I'll visit the airport location. 47 minutes for fries & chicken. Too much socializing by cashier and cook. After a couple of selfies, I think they realized I was still waiting for my order."}
{"text":"The place was packed and the only available spot was at the counter.  My wife and I had the Famous Soulfood platter which comes with cornbread. My two sides was the Mac & Cheese and waffle; my wife on the otherhand had Mac & Cheese with Collard greens.

The employees were all very helpful and attentive even though the place crowded.
The lemonade was served in quart size Mason jars and was really sweet. Maybe they forgot to stir the sugar when it was added. Just have to wait for the ice to melt.

When we got our order the Mac & Cheese was overcooked and the waffle was okay 'cause I like mind crispy. A couple of minutes more would have been perfect. My wife loved the Collard greens and the Southern Fried Chicken was out of this world. The breast I had was huge. I managed to eat most of the Mac and Cheese, waffle and cornbread. It was a LOT of food.

I'm going to try this place again during the week when the place is much calmer, if it ever is."}
{"text":"Just had to get something not too filling. Two breasts, bottle water and Gatorade, $17. Chicken was crisp and moist. Hit the spot for both of us."}
{"text":"I tried to give full marks to Lolo's having heard all the hype. Realize that I am coming from Louisiana and also New York City where one can obtain the namesake specialty rather easily and in variations.
Instead of telling you all the cliche things that you will need to know about Lolo's, I am going to tell you why ultimately I did not \"drink the kool-aid on a  5 star rating.  

Better pricing is the missing star.  I found the place to be on the expensive side for what you get.  It is perhaps a part of my relationship towards this home cooking that makes me feel this way.  But please note:  Service was great...but don't plan on being in and out for a quick lunch unless to do a to go order... Also, these waffles are wonderfully flavored.  I detected a nice hint of vanilla and a touch of cinnamon.  The chicken is nicely seasoned...nothing greasy about this batch.  I will also say that if you are not used to Kool-Aid, or if you are like me and used to be able to water that thing down until the original colour had faded by simply adding batches and batches of sugar to it.... You will be in for a diabetic shock! Here's what to do: Ask for a side glass of water and then inject some of the kool-aid into the water.  My favorite is grape drink!!!  

I am hoping to get back to Lolo's to try their gizzards.  I had the basics on this trip and it is really worth the return trip.  Bring your friends and go and eat late there on Friday night!"}
{"text":"OMG! FINALLY! I've been wanting to try Lolo's on several visits to Phoenix, and finally got my opportunity. Food was amazing. Although compared to may as a Roscoe's knock off, I personally enjoyed Lolo's over Roscoe's. Just sayin. Chicken was well seasoned and full of flavor. Mad respect to the chef. Waffle was cooked right, the mac n cheese was just like how mom makes it. My stomach enjoyed every bite. Only issue I had was the wait. Although we were added to the waitlist through Yelp (shout out to Yelp), we still waited curiously as we saw plenty of tables available. But that was my only issue. The service was good and very nice. This will now be a regular visit for me now."}
{"text":"Love the place! Great food and atmosphere. All the employee looked like they were having a great time.
Wonderful staff! I forgot and left my wallet there and they found it and
took care of it till I could return to get it. THANKS SO MUCH!"}
{"text":"Chicken was a little dry, but totally edible, and that's my only beef. Everything else was flawlessly ordinary. Homefries are seasoned to high hell, but that really worked for them when paired with the grits, they compliment eachother well. Waffles are soft and taste of cinnamon and happiness. French toast is not overpowered by chocolate and caramel sauce, it is surprisingly finishable."}
{"text":"Went in for the first and last time on Saturday night.   The chicken was burnt with pools of grease on top.  It seemed as though they had already cooked chicken and redipped in the fryer to warm.  The sweet tea was stomach churningly sweet.  The service was inattentive.  At the end of our meal a man took our card went outside and chatted with another table, we were in a hurry and had to ask another person to go find out what was going on.  The place was clean and the workers were friendly, but what I really want  from a restaurant is good food, and this place lacks."}
{"text":"Lo lo's was good! Chicken, fried as it should!  Get it if you could, You understood?! LOL. 

This is right near the Phoenix Airport.  Just as you are reading this comment, I had done the same, wondering why in the world did this place get all of these high ratings?  What could it be that I am missing in the world of fried chicken and waffles?!

Naturally, my inclination to satisfy my hunger and curiosity brought me to the restaurant!  Came in right before the lunch crowd at noon and service was quick. 

Ordered fried chicken & waffles, 2 pieces+Mac & cheese , another 2 pieces + waffle.  A lot I know!  My head was bigger than my stomach because I was hungry!  

The waffles' flavor = Superb.  
Fried chicken = Amazing! 
Combining waffles + chicken? = Supmazing! Errrhmmm 

So if you're a fried chicken fan, come on down, if you're a waffle fan come on down... and if you're a fried chicken and waffles fan?  Holy mac...Don't come down...you better hop and fly down! 

Haha I was in the mood for some fried chicken and enjoyed my meal, hope you do too!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with the food Sunday. We usually come on a Sunday and leave satisfied. For starters, my husband's fish (COD) was so hard, he couldn't cut it with a knife. We also waited a long time to replace the fish with a different one.. My grits were the worst I've  had yet at Lolo's, they had a gelatin consistency and crust on the edges. I guess they figured I wouldn't notice with the ton of butter they put on the top of it. I am not sure about Lolo's anymore, the food was different this time around, and that's not a good thing. I am thinking there is a new cook or they might have been understaffed... Not sure what happened. I must say the waitress and manager were friendly, it was simply the food that's did not hit the mark."}
{"text":"So much more than chicken and waffles. This place is an \"experience\"! The collard greens, whipped potatoes, and the fried green tomatoes are absolutely SCRUMPTIOUS!! The staff are awesome and the music is everything. I love both Phoenix and Scottsdale but my favorite is Scottsdale. I love my Lolo's!!!"}
{"text":"So glad I got to finally experience the infamous chicken & waffles! This place was soooo good! The waiter was really funny and polite, which was definitely another plus. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"1st time here, this place came highly recommended.

We had our order as take out, the first girl we encountered had to get another to take our order, guessing order taking was out of the hostesses capabilities. Paid at 5:20pm, left by 5:35pm.

We both ordered chorizo and eggs, sadly only one of us will be eating. It wasn't terribly loud in the place, we repeated our order twice. Obviously taking meal orders is not the second gals job either. However, we did receive utensils for two people.

As far as the staff goes, it seems they are more interested in their 'gossip' than their patrons.

The food may well be amazing, but the staff ruined what could have been a very good meal, had we gotten it.

Not a place we will recommend, nor will we return to."}
{"text":"If I could go 3 1/2 I would, but it was loud and the service was kind of slow. The sides weren't any good-we had the macaroni and cheese and the zuccini and squash. The fries were alright. The fried green tomatoes and okra appetizers were really good. The fried chicken was ok-really greasy and the waffles were ok. I am glad we tried it to see what all the hoopla is about, but I don't need to come back."}
{"text":"The biscuits and gravy are very good. Greeter was friendly to us and we didn't wait long to be seated at lunch. The food took a while coming out.  The new location is much more spacious and very nicely decorated in that southern style. I would give them 4 stars if service was a bit faster and if our waiter checked on us more and was friendlier. Overall, cool place to eat."}
{"text":"Huge portions! A little over whelming, I always have left overs. Their waffles, corn bread, chicken, chili cheese fries, and Mac-n-cheese are very delicious! Oh the biscuits and gravy.... Make my mouth water specially the chicken breast smothered in gravy. 

Service is good for always being packed when I go.

Drinks are served in Mason jars. One to two jars and your full! They will give you to go cups if you'll like. Their sweet tea and kool aid are very very sweet, some people dilute it with water.  This is the only place I'll drink sweet drinks because it's worth it, I tend to always have water or beer. 

I recommend people to come at least once, there is lots to choose from!"}
{"text":"Prior to Lolo's I've only been to Roscoe's in Long Beach, California.  I was very impressed with Lolo's and the food was delicious! I love that the waffles aren't thick and they are just the right texture to eat with fried chicken.  We also had an amazing waitress that was on top of her game.  Her name is Leslie and she had a great attitude.  My parents were also very satisfied with the food and the great service."}
{"text":"Music so loud they who cares about the food !!  So Loud you feel the bear in your head and get a headache!!  Music so loud you literally have to YELL at the waitress to order or the person next to you. Requested it be turned down twice to no avail.  No reason to have it so loud."}
{"text":"Here's the deal. I am a Lo Lo's fan! Just not this location. You need to stick to the original on Yuma. Lo Lo's is good, just not great.

Service - poor. It took over 15 minutes after being seated before anyone came over to the table. Once ordered, it took almost 300 minutes for our food and our orders were not correct. They were not able correct the orders until it was time to leave.

The was good but not hot.

There was not follow up at the table to see if all was well or we needed beverages.

Stick to downtown!!

If you want GREAT C&W's go to \"Tuck Stop\""}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles.  The food was delicious!  Their chicken is very juicy and tasty!!!  And that corn muffin is like eating a piece of cake!  Yum!  Didn't know I'd like chicken and waffles together, but it is such a surprisingly, wonderful combination!  My hubby wants to eat here once A DAY while we're visiting Scottsdale!. Unfortunately, we can't eat like that every day!"}
{"text":"I did not find it to live up to the expectations set by others who have been there. You don't get very much food for the price and the taste was not worth the 45 minute drive or the 40 minute wait. The service was okay, at best. Would I recommend it? Probably not. It was cool to try something different because there are not really any soul food restaurants in AZ, but I won't be back. My mother-in-law can outcook this place anytime that I'm hungry for soul food and she only lives 15 minutes away. There is also not a big variety that they offer. When people said soul food, I really thought they'd have more than chicken and waffles and a few other things. They don't. There is pretty much beans, mac & cheese, chicken and waffles and that's your selection on the menu. Also $2.50 for a glass of kool-aid is not cool."}
{"text":"Same owner as Joe's BBQ,  just stay away and go somewhere better. The service is just as the other reviewers have said: it's subpar."}
{"text":"I had their PHAT AZZ Samich and it was PHAT! Oh my! It was delicious and huge! Husband had the fried chicken and said it was the best he ever had in a restaurant. Girl child had the chicken and waffles, she loved it. I swear I heard moaning from several tables as people started eating. Totally worth the drive and the wait!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice before, but I took my boyfriend and he loved it!! The portion sizes are big, you get your money's worth, and the atmosphere is fun. Our service was decent, everyone was relatively friendly but it was nothing special. Still a great meal nonetheless."}
{"text":"Awesome chicken and waffles. Great prices. Just as good as the others spots that I've been to in NYC, LA, and ATL. I honestly think that their chicken batter is better than most."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God.

How have I never been to Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles after 8 years in the Valley? Shame on all of my friends for waiting so long to take me to this hidden gem!!

Think fried chicken with your breakfast of waffles, eggs, and cheese grits sounds gross?  Well you have never been more wrong my friend!

I don't quite know how, but it was oh so right.  And I am not a big meat with my eggs fan (i.e. steak and eggs) fan in general so no one was more surprised than me when I was left craving some more of that delicious fried perfection after Brad E was kind enough to share some of his with me.

The waffles are dusted with cinnamon and melt in your mouth.  The cheese grits are wonderfully authentic to a southern girl such as myself, and let's be honest, who in their right mind would ever complain about a freakin' Mason Jar filled to the brim with delicious kool-aid.

I ordered WAY too much food for myself (shocker) so I didn't even get to sample the mac and cheese, corn, and other incredibly enticing side dishes that were scattered about my table.

Yes, the place is kind of cramped and you'll wait longer than you want for your food, but deal with it, you'll be thrilled you did."}
{"text":"This place is on Roscoe's. Chicken and waffles with smothered Lo Lo gravy...Oh my. Service was great and fast.

Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Perfect everything! Long wait but worth it! Best Chicken and Waffles I have had in a while! Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Sinfully Delicious: A Ladies Lunch of Gluttony

Once upon a time there were two coworkers.  They had been talking about going to Lo-Lo's and kept saying they would go there as a reward when they met some of their fitness goals.  Well, one coworker left the company before they made their goals, so they went there with a third coworker for her going away lunch.

They were a little curious where they were being taken when they ended up in the middle of nowhere in a not-so-great neighborhood.  They found a parking spot after 5 minutes of driving around, u-turns, and backing up.  They walked into the small house and got a seat in the very back on the side seating area.  The place was packed.

Two ordered a water and lemonade and the third went for the sweet tea.  It was SO sweet and SO good.  The jar they brought it in seemed enough for the whole table, but somehow she managed to take it down without a problem.

She ordered Tre-Tre's (2 chicken legs and a waffle) and a side of Mac n' Cheese.  They also split two cornbread muffins between the three of them.  They took a late lunch and waited a little while for their order so by the time it arrived, they were ravenously hungry and dug right in to the grub.  They didn't talk to each other for five minutes except to comment on the food and ask one another if they had tried it all yet.  The chicken was juicy and crunchy.  The waffles were soft and topped with buttery syrup goodness.  The mac n' cheese was creamy and rich.  The cornbread was fluffy and delicious.

After the initial feeding frenzy took place, they began to slow down.  It began getting hotter and hotter, but they kept eating, drinking, and sweating.  It was glorious!  The server came with the bill and the gluttonous ladies were so full and in a food haze they could barely explain how to split the check.  They sat for a while before they were able to leave and finally made their way back to work.  They proceeded to dream all day about the chicken, waffles, mac n' cheese, cornbread, sweet tea, lemonade, and all the goodness they consumed in less than 20 minutes.  Some of the women were more comfortable for the remainder of the day based on their wardrobe choices.  Everyone else was none the wiser.  All that was left to do was plan their next trip to Lo-Lo's and also the sister restaurant Mrs. White's Golden Rule.

The End.

The moral of the story:  Wear big pants with an elastic waist and order everything that looks good."}
{"text":"Its good, but not so good that I would make it a main stay in my restaurant experience.  I got the chicken and waffles (obviously) and the purple drank... Also got the banana pudding.  It was all good, but not mind blowing. 
Loved the atmosphere though and the staff are a delight.  It is a place that you have to check out, but obviously not the most healthy place in the world!"}
{"text":"Lo-los. Dang.  The food is five stars. We walked in and let me tell you this place is not on the best side of town. The back parking lot does not have good lighting but as my brother is big and has a lot of muscles I was not too concerned. We rode in on a Friday at about 9 p.m. and ask for a patio table. It was about 10 minutes before they cleaned the table off. I questioned the waitress about beers and wine and whatever else they had. Ended up ordering a Chardonnay.  I got a plain waffle with dark meat two legs. My brother ordered some kind of waffle with 3 different dark meats. Add an extra chicken thigh please.

 She brought us out some water and I asked her where my wine is at. She said you didn't order anything with me. There weren't that many people there and she was the only server that came to the table. My brother even told her that he hates when I drinks but he knows that I ordered something. So it was kind of awkward. So the food showed up almost the same time as the glass of wine and of course he did not get his extra thigh. She did not act like she knew that she messed up the order. Just  inadequate service with no apology the whole time. But the food was great. The waffle was so delicious. I wish I could have finished it. My brother got something with two waffles in dark meat in the extra thigh and he devoured it. I couldn't eat all of mine. I should have took it back to my brother's place. This place is delicious. Omg.I just found there's one in Dallas. I will be there!"}
{"text":"Have been to this and the Scottsdale location several times. Good food and laid back atmosphere. Sometimes you might have to wait longer than you would like for a refill or to pay your bill, but generally the service is decent. 

I usually get the fried catfish plate with Mac n cheese and greens. Have also tried the waffle sandwich. Stepped outside the box once or twice and got the shrimp n grits and the salmon croquettes. Not impressed with either. Also wish they had peach cobbler."}
{"text":"So I shouldn't eat refined carbohydrates...but if I'm goin to Lo-Lo's I'm gonna tear it up! I took my niece Ivy on Monday...actually she paid so who took who, right? Anyway...we arrived right at 9am when they opened and sat right down. The waiters were cool and cute...made sure the table was freshly wiped down and brought the high chair for baby John Ford with a smile. I ordered the #2 Baby Ray...3 smothered chicken thighs with gravy and onions, 2 waffles, and a side of grits, and even though I suffer from \"Sugar Diabetis\" as my family still calls it...yeah, I admit my white trash culture...I ordered a jar of Red Kool-Aid Drank. Man...it's worth the risk of diabetic coma...the sweetest Kool-Aid Drank ever...tastes like summer! The food was amazing as always...the waffles have a hint of cinnamon ...smothered in butter didn't even need the warm syrup! The chicken was delicious, and the grits were creamy and soooo comforting! My niece said Lo-Lo's was the best chicken and waffles she ever had...and she's had 'em in Oakland!!! 
We were both very disappointed there was no red velvet cake...but had sock-it-to-me instead that was like pound cake on crack! Like a cinnamon roll banged a pound cake! 
I spent the rest of the day napping and farting...heaven!"}
{"text":"Great service at a decent price. Good size portions to!"}
{"text":"What a tourist find for Sat morning breakfast! Fried chicken was deelish and had it's own unique taste. Their chciken legs were huge! And the biscuits and gravy were awesome. What a down home combo!!"}
{"text":"I'm a SoCal girl looking for some Southern food.  The place wasn't too bad. I went last year to try the chicken and waffles with a bit of sweet tea.  The decor was modern, the food was filling.  The chicken was crispy and the service was nice.  

I'd come again."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in over 7 months and I still think of this place! Great atmosphere, great service, and amazing food. Anyone who says Roscoe's is the best chicken and waffles place has obviously never had Lo-Lo's!"}
{"text":"Well it's been a while since I've been here, however...

Lo-Lo's is about the closest thing I've gotten to soul food since I'd lived in Phoenix.  Though most people go for the chicken and waffles, I much more prefer their smothered chicken with hash browns, collared greens, and sweet yams.  Be forewarned -- the smothered chicken is salty.  Much saltier than most people would prefer, tbh, at least if their palate is fairly \"white\" (as in not eating a lot of spices and salt and whatnot).

The sweet tea is always phenomenal and the red velvet cake is comparable to stuff I've eaten back East (i.e. it's fantastic).

For first timers, you will probably get \"the itis\" after eating here: make sure you have someone else with you who can handle the insulin overload and can drive you home.  I had taken an ex here after showing her The Boondocks episode about the itis (I know, I know) and she thought it was a myth until she started nodding off in the restautant itself.  You eat here and you don't need to eat for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Ok, so you hear Chicken and Waffles and most people ask.... Together? I never thought it sounded strange but even if I did one thing I can say is Betty Boop I love you! The Betty Boop is a simple Chicken Breast on a waffle... But there is nothing simple about the yummy factor in your mouth!!! Perfectly crispy skin, moist and salty chicken on top of a thin, crispy but fluffy waffle. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! Have some vodka in fruit punch and call is brunch :)

Five stars for just plain delicious!"}
{"text":"Literally some of the best chicken and waffles ive ever had! Great music and a great vibe! The smothered potatoes and mac and cheese are delicious! A bit  much with the slang in the menu and item names for me but it all tastes great"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. I had the #3 Lo-Lo's chicken and waffles. I loved it! The food was great, the atmosphere is great, the service is great. We had awesomeness me service from our server AJ! Looks my forward to coming back and try other items from the menu."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. I've heard such amazing things from so many. When I heard my office was catering them for a meeting  a while back I was excited. Who doesn't love a free lunch?! That all changes once it came. The waffles were soggy and the kool aid was so sugary I couldn't even finish a cup. I will say the chicken was probably the best part, but not impressed . I'll have to give it at least another try in the future at the restaurant itself because the catered food was such a let down."}
{"text":"Outside looks kinda like an old building, but inside was pretty spacious with booths and tables and I think a bar towards the back, they also had an outdoor seating area with a section with couches and a fireplace.  Can't remember the number but I think we ordered the #9 (drum/thigh and waffle) ,2 #10, (two drums & waffle) and kids grilled cheese.  It was all so yummy! The chicken was delicious, I'd say better than what we have on Maui...like kfc, Zippy's, and minute stop chicken.  We also ordered milk for the kids and sweetened iced tea and that was very yummy too!! Our total was under $40.  Workers are very friendly too ;)"}
{"text":"I don't even like fried chicken but this place is addicting! Love it, highly reccommended!"}
{"text":"Love their fired chicken, waffle, and red velvet cake. They have great DJ too. The music is good. However, there are too many flies in the restaurant. Unfortunately, it's very distracting. The food is good enough that I will definitely come back. Hopefully they will fix the fly problem."}
{"text":"At first I was excited to be here but after the waitress came back and told me that they mistakenly put the wrong order in and asked me if I wanted this OR the original order I had placed. I told her that I wanted the original order I had placed. Well they brought everything out for the table. I was the only one stuck watching other people eat. This kinda sucked because I was starving! They had served me the sides that come with the order and by the time they were almost gone I finally got my main course. It was the catfish served plain on a plate! There was no seasoning, the batter was tasteless, and I must say the food overall was pretty damn weak! 

The drinks we ordered were Kool-Aid thinking how cool would it be to get something that harkens back to childhood. Strangely this stuff burned my tongue because it wasn't mixed right. So I asked for a Bloody mary. The bloody mary came to me in what looked like an 8oz serving for a whopping $8.50!!!! This is ridiculous, its pre made mix with a piece of bacon in it! Nothing Special! 
All in all this sucks as we only went here because when polled online, a lot of people said that we should go here! All in all the service sucked, and the food was super sub par. The catfish was served battered with no condiments, not even lemon wedges to squeeze onto it to make it taste better! Needless to say I took the stuff home and dressed it like it shoulda been and it was good. So if you are in the market to buy expensive catfish to take home and \" Recook\" then this is a good bet, but most want the experience as is! In this case good luck!"}
{"text":"Not good,unless you like being forced to pay for gratuity.service ok.overprice chicken with a waffle your better off going to kfc...."}
{"text":"This is by far the best chicken & waffles place you will ever go to in town!! They do have an extremely longgggg wait time if you are planning on going during the weekend to be seated but I promise you it is worth the wait. Everyone is always so friendly and we definitely need more places like this."}
{"text":"Don't come hungry!
The food was good. The wait time is out of control. We were seated in 50 min and the food trickled in about an hour later. Are you wondering how the food trickled? Let me explain, 2 people were completely finished with their meals before my meal came to the table. SMH."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable. Great food. Crazy good chicken. The chicken legs are insanely huge. Just get one to be amazed. Drinks were great too. Service was outstanding. Parking can be hard with the hotel next door, but there is valet service."}
{"text":"I've been on a real bender lately...and this Fried Chicken was worth it!...I got the Betty Boop which is a huge fried chicken breast with a super fresh and tasty waffle...the chicken was juicy, moist and perfectly fried!  I smothered my waffle in the butter and syrup and need I say more...this was paradise!  I complimented my meal with a super sized mason jar of red koolaid and it was the perfect thing to wash this meal down with!  You have to get the Red Velvet cake it's a must have!!! This is a super fun place to go!"}
{"text":"LoLo's Chicken and Waffles
2765 N. Scottsdale Road
Scottsdale
Visa, MasterCard

While there isn't much in soul food in the Phoenix area, people have always flocked to Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe in the downtown area. Her grandson opened the original LoLo's also in the downtown area, and this summer, thankfully opened a LoLo's in Scottsdale for all the east siders to enjoy.

LoLo's menu is a bit different in that they serve waffles with their chicken as well as a number of breakfast favorites. To begin, companion pronounced the waffles light, fluffy, and with good texture. Waffles are served with a cruette of maple syrup which should be enough for the average person, but if you like, they will gladly bring you enough to drown your waffle(s) in.

Their chicken is the epitome of fried chicken. It is so different from the fried chicken chains that it is like night and day. Perfectly battered, seasoned and cooked, it can't be beat. It has just enough batter to give it a nice coating without being gobbed on like wallpaper paste. As for flavor - the only thing that comes to mind is wow! It's chicken! Not bunches of herbs and spices, but real, honest to goodness chicken flavor like it was meant to be.

I ordered the Soulfood Platter ($13.00), which came with 3 pieces of chicken and 2 sides. My sides were collard greens and red beans and rice. The collard greens had no woodiness to them, and were cooked to perfection. The addition of a little Trappey's hot pepper & vinegar sauce forced me to devour the entire bowl! The red beans and rice were nicely done, and again, the addition of a little red hot sauce really made the day. For those who don't care for hot sauces, they were fine without it also. Their portion also includes a piece of homemade cornbread smothered in butter. Speaking of smothered, I also had a small bowl of gravy on the side to smother my chicken with. It had perfect flavor and just the right amount of spice.

Companion ordered the LoLo's ($11.00) which consisted of 3 perfectly cooked pieces of fried chicken served on top of 2 perfect waffles. Companion also ordered a side of Cheese Grits ($3.50) which were just o.k., but were far from being bad.

We also ordered a plate of Backwoods ($12.00) to share, which are chicken gizzards in gravy served over rice and onions. I'm sure I died and went to heaven on this dish. Gizzards are normally small chewy morsels that you can chew for five or 10 minutes before gulping them down. I don't know how they made these, but they were magnificently tender - one or two bites and it was gone! If I came back and was only able to order one dish, this might be the one - then again, it might be the chicken - then again.....

Companion ordered sweet tea and immediately noticed that it was still a little warm. Unlike most places, they make everything, including the sweet tea, fresh on the premises.

Companion has eaten at Pity Pat Porch in Atlanta and pronounced the food to be much better at LoLo's.

This isn't the place to come for ambiance - basically, there is none. It's the place to come for really good food. The restaurant was clean, and the restrooms were clean.

If this review doesn't make you want to eat here, perhaps the line out the door will. Fortunately, the line moves fairly quickly, but more and more people are discovering this jewel. Look out Mrs. White - your grandson is coming up fast!"}
{"text":"This is an update on my previous review of Lolo's. That review was written about their previous location on Scottsdale road before they moved to this site.

Food has greatly changed since the move. The backwoods that I ordered which was my favorite in the past now is made with jalapeno's in it and much less sauce and meat.

Chicken no longer seems to use the original recipe and has changed.

The atmosphere is loud and service almost non existent. Lunch required 3 hours due to waiting or a waitress or waiter when none showed up. Then the wrong orders were brought, drinks were never refilled and the meal was a total shambles.

My last review was a 5 star review, but they have gone so far downhill that I can only give them 2 stars at this time.

I'm going back to Mrs. Whites where even though she no longer cooks, the recipes aren't tampered with and service is still done with a smile and in a timely manner.

Perhaps if Lolo's didn't try to franchise so quickly and paid more attention to this restaurant it might have been better."}
{"text":"Amazing place great service huge portions and chicken and waffles. Line was out the door when we got there and still when we left. We got seated fairly quickly after we were told 30-40 min wait. I had a mason jar of Arnold Palmer and my friend had grape Kool-aid. Amazing food!"}
{"text":"I dropped into this Lo-Lo's on a Thursday afternoon with several coworkers after a nearby customer start-up meeting. 

Even though the place was busy and buzzing with patrons, somehow the four of us were seated immediately. 

Unfortunately, mere weeks before a competition meant no juicy, delicious Betty's Boob combo for me. 

Who da fack gets a salad at Lo-Lo's? I know, right? Me apparently. Lame. 

I ordered the The \"Vibe\" Chopped Chicken Salad, hold the feta and cheddar and the citrus herb vinaigrette on the side and it was delicious. 

No dried up chicken here, every bite was juicy! 

Oh, and this plate came out blazing hot with ample chicken, and all the romaine, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and kalamata olives were fresh and didn't look sad or wilted (something that happens often when you order salads in places like this).

Really enjoyed the flavor of the dressing and have recreated similar versions at home ever since. 

For lunch, service was friendly and on-point, getting us out to the next meeting quickly. 

Now to come back and enjoy a waffle or ten . . ."}
{"text":"Same service every time. Its good, its quick, its to the point and the food it always perfect!! 
I don't suggest going on a Sunday morning for your first time though and their bloody Mary's are not very delicious."}
{"text":"Not sure what was going on tonight, but we were so dissatisfied with our meals. Took way to long to get our food. My daughter was the only person to have satisfying food (Omelette) Our waffles were room temp to where the cold butter didn't even melt, eggs not cooked to order, chicken & geeens were salty, not even the gravy on the biscuits could make them soft. Very off night for this place."}
{"text":"I'll probably get a black eye from you hard core Lolo-lovers for this review, but I've got to be honest:

Nice service
Sticky menus
Dry chicken (ok, ok, so I ordered the breast.  A leg I tried was much juicer)
Mushy mac & cheese
Spongy, ordinary waffles
No booze.  I repeat.  No booze.  $3 for soda and \"drank\"... 
Décor has been redone and is nice & modern and all, but it just doesn't go with the theme of Chicken & Waffles.  At all.  Serious disconnect.
It's not terribly expensive, but for what you're actually getting it's far from a value.
Lots of families- happy kids, dads sneaking in the bathroom for intermittent whiskey snips."}
{"text":"I've tried dining here twice.  The first time I visited, the resto was so packed, I waited ten minutes and then left.  The second time, debated on leaving, but stayed.  Had fried chicken, a waffle, cornbread, and the candied yams.  Best thing were the yams!  Chicken was alright.  Waffle was too thin, light in color, and soggy.  It didn't help to witness one of the staff sneaking in the back with a bag of Bisquick while I was waiting for a table.  I thought the waffles and batter were homemade??  Cornbread didn't even compare to Redfish or Z'Tejas!  Honestly, it tasted like the dried versions I tried at Big City BBQ and Marie Callender's... Tsk, tsk.

If I were to return, it would only be for the candied yams/sweet potatoes.  Those deserved 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This review would easily be five stars if it was based on food alone.The combination of waffles and fried chicken is amazing. It is truly fried southern goodness. We also ordered some cornbread to hold us over until the food got there and it was perfectly made.

We were there during the Sunday morning brunch rush, but the wait actually wasn't that bad.Unfortunately, the service, which wasn't great when it was the small house got much worse with the upgraded structure. The new building is great and the music really compliments the ambiance as well. Our drink order came out wrong (ice tea instead of hot tea) and when we told the server, she never fixed it. She took an additional 10 minutes to get our order after that. Once we got our meal, she never returned to ensure it was correct either. We asked for our check and ten minutes later she asked us if we wanted dessert and we had to ask for our check again. Eventually we got it from another server. It's a shame that the service doesn't reflect the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Well we finally made it to Lo-Lo's for lunch after hearing so much about it!! All I can say is what took us so long?!? This place was amazing!

We came about 3pm on a Sunday and had a 10-15 min wait. I loved looking around the restaurant and really liked the red brick inside and out. Also I liked the decor of lights made out of mason jars and TVs around. Waiting was not a problem. Once we were sat we were greeted with a friendly waiter, I think his name was Joseph. 

I ordered the catfish and waffle and my wife had the #2 Baby Ray, basically 3 piece chicken meal with 2 waffles with gravy and onions. We also had a side of the Mac n cheese too. All in all I thought the food was outstanding!  Probably best friend chicken I've ever had. I loved it even more with a bite of chicken and waffle at the same time! Simply amazing. The catfish was also equally amazing. Very flakey and fried just right. The waffles were made perfect too and I can't forget about the gravy. Very thick and yummy. Oh and the Mac! I heard that they have mushrooms in the Mac. I'm not a fan if mushrooms but gave it a try and I'm glad I did. Was also great
We ended our meal with a taste of the red velvet cake.  But we had to get it to go because we were both so stuffed! But when I did try it, it's didn't disappoint!  Very hearty and I liked the walnuts in it. 

All in all I have no idea what took us so long to try Lo-Lo's!!  Now that I know where it's at ill definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Came her Super Bowl weekend for late breakfast. Given 30 minute estimate for a table for party of three which ended up being slightly faster. The rub is that we could see multiple stations with empty tables for the entire time we waited to be seated. My friend insisted that this was the business model to make people wait for a table to create a sense of demand. All if did was create a sense of starvation and impatience. 

We ordered a spicy Bloody Mary from bar which was severely under staffed and took almost as long as the table. The drink was awesome but the manager needed to step behind the bar and relieve the back log of orders created by a large superbowl crowd drinking early. 

I ordered chorizo and eggs. Brad ordered their signature chicken and waffles and Melissa got the biscuits and gravy. Brad loves this place. It's my first time. The menu looks great and judging by the crowd the food matches the pictures. 

Chorizo was a big winner 5 out of 5!  Waffles and chicken was ok and if your hungry is very filling. Waffles are the thin variety. The recipe, like the chicken batter, was nothing spectacular. Biscuits and Gravy gets a perfect rating. Fluffy biscuits and yummy gravy. My recommendation is more gravy. Smoother the plate because we ran out of gravy way before the biscuits. Has to be balanced so they climax at the same time 

We had lots left over and check would have been reasonable to high if not for bar tab. I will come back but under performing chicken and waffles plus long wait and staffing shortage behind the bar brings the rating down to solid 3."}
{"text":"Wow, talk about covering all your essential food groups: grease, oil, lard, and fat. Oh, I forgot the maple syrup: pure sugary goodness. I ate waffles.. fried chicken... salmon cakes... bacon... grits... It was a food coma done right. I have to disclose that the after-effects include: waist expansion, sleepiness, and an insatiable need to be still and slothlike. 

Despite the health risks of eating at Lo-Lo's, it's pure bliss: a symphonic orchestra of flavors that should be experienced on a regulated basis - try once every few months."}
{"text":"I came here with a girlfriend and were told the wait would be 45 min.  

We left for 30 min and came back only to find that we had missed them calling us. AH!

We let the ladies know we were there and they (very sweetly) accommodated us, (probably because we were only two people and fit on a postage stamp).

I did not have the Kool Aid, but an alcoholic beverage at the top of their \"drinks\" menu and it was FANTASTIC. I\"m almost positive it had red Kool Aid, vodka and pineapple juice.

I ordered Betty's Boob, a perfect combo to taste their chicken and SCRUMPTIOUS waffle and then ordered Mac & Cheese and Cheese Grits on the side.  

The Betty's Boob was AMAZING.  The waffle was scrumptious and the chicken skin was fabulous.  The meat itself was juicy, but not in the right way.  The interior meat was a little dry, but the outer meat was juicy.  But I'm nitpicking. 

We were told the Mac was amazing, and I will say as a Mac and Cheese aficionado, it was not good.  It was not creamy in any sense, and was definitely more Southern in style as it was Mac you could build with (thick).  Not the creamy type I have come to adore.  

The Cheese Grits were gone in a matter of seconds. I LOVED them.

We also ordered Red Velvet cake at the end, to see what all of the fuss was about and it was BAD.  The driest and least cocoa-y Red Velvet cake I have ever had.  The cream cheese icing is so cloyingly sweet, it almost hurt my teeth going in.  I would like to see their recipe include more oil/egg to give a more moist texture.  

I will say I smelled Collard Greens walking buy me all morning and WISHED I had ordered them instead of my Mac.  I will DEFINITELY order them next time.

Our waitress was AMAZING and when I walked away from my birthday present under the table, a nice guy came up and made sure I didn't leave without it.

Normally from food alone, this would get a 3, but I want to try a BUNCH more sides that looked awesome, and the service was impeccable. :)"}
{"text":"Ever go to a movie that everyone has been talking about because it is suppose to be the best ever.  I came here yesterday with really high expectations but to tell you the truth I don't have a place that serves my favorite fried chicken....or waffles for that matter.  The food was good, but I just couldn't get out of my head that it wasn't all that.  The chicken was very crispy but I wish it had more seasoning on it or something.  The waffles were pretty good but I really wasn't in the mood for that at lunch anyway.  The atmosphere was really cool, very casual and very clean, the pictures on the wall were neat and the service was great.  I don't want to downplay this place but maybe I need to come back and order something else."}
{"text":"Third times a Charm- This was the third time I attempted to try Lo Lo's. The first two times: It was before the new building and  was located in a tiny house with a Long  line and no parking. Second, pretty much the same story.
 Today- Finally made it in. Ill start with this. Valet parking only. It's free ( But you have to tip, so not really free)
   Always a wait- we went before lunch but after breakfast so the wait was only 10 mins. I've been to Roscoe's in Long Beach so I really didn't have a burning desire to wait that long. There are tons of restaurants in Phx- IMO I have never eaten at one that was worth a huge long time wait. 
   The staff was friendly. Waiter very nice. We had already looked at the menu online so we were ready to order. Food took awhile but they were busy so we expected as much, no problem.
I ordered the chicken tenders with two sides- dirty rice and fries. Dirty rice wasn't on the menu anymore but I asked and they had it. Delish.
My hubby ordered KK. We both liked everything we ordered. I feel they are a little pricey, but not overly. And everything tasted good so we would consider going back in the future.
If my husband was writing this he would give 5 stars- he loved everything about LoLo's."}
{"text":"If this place was closer is come once a week. The servers are great. The food is always good. I also think this one is better than the one in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Delectable fried chicken, collard greens & cornbread! Wishing there was a Lo-Lo's back home in MO!"}
{"text":"So good! Awesome atmosphere and super friendly service with delicious food. Absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the problem is the menu keeps changing. They offer s two piece chicken with a side dish for $8 the side dish of Mac n cheese. However if you want to sub out for collard greens can't do must be add on.
The Mac n cheese and collard greens are both $5.29 so why can't you sub? Whatever happened to accommodate the customer if possible and reasonable even if the side dish were more just charge the difference, I'm not expecting them to take a financial hit.

If you go to Butterfield's they will change, upgrade or add anything to any dish, sometimes there's an upcharge which is fine. I always walk out happy!"}
{"text":"The eggs I got at the express airport version were not at all the same I get in the restaurant. I ordered a lemonade and was given no choice in size.  So I paid nearly 5 dollars for a rather large (32 oz) cup. I accidentally knocked it over when picking my eggs up. I had only drank 1/5 of the cup and asked if there was a refill price to replace the spilled lemonade and the employee said I'd need to pay full price. I was pretty astonished."}
{"text":"Best chicken and waffles place I've been too! Super crunchy and flavorful . That hot sauce is bomb!"}
{"text":"For now I can only give this establishment 2 stars since I really don't know how a fried chicken joint can over cook a thigh. I can cook a thigh at home on my George Foreman grill without overcooking and drying it out, this place shouldn't have an excuse. Sides were also meh, I've had better at the local fried chicken joint in Dallas where its unlimited refills. The 2 things I enjoyed were the Kool-aid on tap and the breading/flavoring of the skin on the chicken. I may try this place again in the future, but for now I am pretty disappointed with my AZ fried chicken experience. Oh I almost forgot, their famous red velvet cake tasted dry and gritty, sorta like a cake made from a Betty Crocker box. Nobody in my party really liked it, on the plus side the waiter did apologize and comp the dessert from our tab and promised us this wasn't the norm for this cake."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time the other day and got a to-go order of the chicken tenders with a waffle. It was so good! The chicken was juicy and flavorful while the waffle was fluffy and light. I loved that the waffle had a slight cinnamon-coconut flavor, like the waffle press was greased with coconut oil. 

I wish I could've tried their sweet tea but they were out when we ordered our food. We'll just have to come back and try again. Oh darn :) Overall, really great food. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"The food is five stars. The service shouldn't receive any. Service is AWFUL. I've been a server for years and I understand a stressful busy environment, but frankly for this establishment there is no excuse. We waited 20 minutes to simply be greeted and order drinks. The ladies next to us waited 30 minutes, then an additional 20 just to get drinks. Multiple people got up and walked out because they weren't served at all. This was the case for not only the tables but the bar and the bartenders as well. The bartender was in a five foot vicinity of its customers and they still weren't being helped. The worst part was there was NO SENSE OF URGENCY whatsoever. Servers and bartenders strolled along seemingly oblivious to the fact that people were complaining and walking out. Witnessed multiple people complain to their server and nothing changed. No hustle, no teamwork. Had to flag down 3 waitresses to simply get hot sauce and silverware. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed and angry. I will not be returning simply for the horrible service myself and those around me received, and this is coming from someone in the industry. Lolo's needs to seriously reevaluate the staff as a whole or you will lose the business that you deserve when you have great food. You definitely lost more than a few customers today."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and shared a Soulfood Platter - we got 3 pieces of fried chicken (a breast, leg and wing), 2 sides (a waffle and the collard greens) a cornbread muffin and we also decided to get an extra side of mac & cheese.  A perfect amount to share, a great way to get to try a variety of different things, and I didn't feel like I was going to have to roll myself out of the place.  I've never had collard greens and they were really good - a touch spicy, but in a good way.  Everything was great and was served super fast.  Would definately go back."}
{"text":"The girl told me 10 mins to be seated. After 20 mins she said 10 more mins. Once seated no one came over to take our order until I ask twice.  Then saw people who came in after us get there food before us. We finally received our food after 25-30 mins at table. But there was a large family group with 3 little ones who were seated at least 30 mins prior to us who had not had their order taken. When the manager came to my table I ask him to please check on that family. They were so frustrated that words were exchanged and they left. Very bad experience!!!! The food was probably good but I could t enjoy it because of the frustration with the poor and unorganized service. SMH!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the waitress was not. She did not explain the menu well and I ended up with 2 macaroni and cheese sides after waiting 20 minutes to order and then another 20-30 min for our food. I ordered the fish and chips and only got the fish. 3 people at my table waited an extra 20-30 min for their food to arrive. It was a mess. It was my 1st time here."}
{"text":"I had lunch at the Scottsdale location this week.  I was carrying a Contigo water bottle.  The hostess who seated me asked what was in the water bottle.  DUH - water!  Odd- never had that happen before.   I was seated right away but it took 10-15 minutes for the person to take the order.  Food came out very quickly.  Chicken breast was lukewarm, tough and not very tasty.  KFC has better chicken for less money.  Waffle was ok but the maple syrup had no maple flavor.  Paid with a credit card and had to show a driver's license.  Odd again -- can't recall that happening in a long time.   There are many places to eat where the food is better and your water bottle is not treated with suspicion.  Skip this place"}
{"text":"Customer service was great from the am crew, I forgot my waiters name (tall, blk gentleman) he was awesome, told him it was me and my best friends first time there, he didn't rush us to order, he gave us some pointers on what to order as well.

Returned later that evening for dinner (yes, it was THAT GOOD) more of a younger staff, our waitress seemed like she really didn't want to be there, but whatever... overall the place is great and the food is even better! 

Almost forgot: for it to be a nice establishment, someone needs to monitor the cleaniness of the bathroom, then again it was in the evening with the younger crew."}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles is SUBPAR (not up to standards, below average). An hour to be seated. Another hour to be served. Mediocre service, mediocre food. Recommendation: Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"The wait is worth every minute. We expected it.
We were not disappointed by the service or the food.
Way better than Roscoes in CA."}
{"text":"It's expensive and the atmosphere is just inexplicably weird.  I haven't been to the Phoenix location, just the Scottsdale one, so maybe it's different. There's nothing wrong with the food, it's just overpriced.  I don't like the idea of chicken and waffles, but that by no means affects my rating of the place, because they have plenty of combinations if you're put off by one thing or another.  I thought their chicken was pretty good.  I can't bad mouth the portion sizes, either.  I can't say I was ever impressed with the service though.  I don't think I'd be back, but I wouldn't scream if someone suggested it on a group outing or something.   Meh."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times. Sometimes it's a hit or miss depending on your server. It can either be great or not. 
I can either get checked on a few times or no times. I can wait for my server for a minute till I spot them in the crowd or not see them for 15 minutes while I wait to pay and leave. 

The food is pretty good. The place I trust for some hearty southern food!
Their macaroni and shrimp is great! Comes with a biscuit but to be warned, it is extremely filling. I can't even finish half my plate. 
Corn bread is always a favorite for me when I go! 
Chicken is pretty moist depending on the piece you get. I usually go for thighs since I like dark meat. 
Waffles are yummy yummy too and I don't really need syrup for it! 

Overall, great food, just hit or miss service which can be disappointing :("}
{"text":"I must say it is a great place to go when your craving some good authentic Soul Food and waffles..... The atmosphere is very friendly and relaxing.... Their is always help walking around ready to serve you and answer any questions you have.... 

I had the 3 piece fried chicken with a side of collard greens and mac and cheese it also came with a buttery corn muffin.... The food was hot, fast, tasty, and fresh.... 

I love the gospel sunday.... It makes me feel at home.... And the fact that you can order kool aid makes this place feel even more like home..... 

Whether you have room for desert or not you have to order it...
 The banana pudding, red velvet cake, or sock it to me cake.... They all taste great.... 

I most definitly will say that you should give this place a try.... 
Mmmmmm.....Mmmmm..... Good.....!!!"}
{"text":"Thanks for entertaining us Rachelle. Can't wait to come back. Your friends from Groupon."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to the Scottsdale location after 2 visits to the Phoenix branch. We arrived after the dinner rush (approx 7:30 pm) and was seated after a short wait.  The chairs at our table felt sticky (kinda gross). It appeared that the resturant was clearing out and our server was quick to get our drinks and appetizer. The server was nice at first. However, throughout the evening he would come to the table, leave something and walk away without saying a word. Ordered fried green tomatoes and they were ok. Nothing to write home about but did the trick. I am so glad we ordered them because our meals took another 45 minutes to get to our table. Our server had told us our food would be \"ready soon\" then he disaapeared. We flagged down a different server to inquire about our food. She explained that their computer went down and the manager was in the kitchen calling out orders. At this point there is probably about 5 other tables in the place, not busy at all. I've worked in many a kitchen and never had an issue like the kitchen printer not working slow service down that much. Plus,  if there was any issue an explanation was given to the guests. Don't leave hungry guests guessing where their food is! 

Chicken and waffles were excellent (which is why they get 2 stars). Service was bad. Took them 4-5 minutes to get my son's salad to him after the rest of us were served. Another side was served 15 minutes after the meals which the server just placed on the table in silence...no apology,  no explanation. 

Floor was filthy, trash and food everywhere.  Bathrooms were not much better. Hostess started cleaning the glass doors while we were finishing eating, spraying the cleaner which had a strong chemical smell. I prefer to enjoy my meals without the smell of burning plastic. But, that could just be me. There are many things that are subtle signs to guests to \"get the hell out\" of a resturant and starting nightly cleaning is one of them. (They were still open for another 45 minutes)

Good food...horrid service. I will stick to the Phoenix location from here on out."}
{"text":"They just opened this one not too long ago and I have already fell in love with this place. Of course the name and thought of mixing chicken and waffles isn't something that may sound appetizing but boy was I wrong. Not only was their signature dish, chicken and waffles delicious. Every plate that I have ever ordered has been really good, the meat has always been cooked to perfection and their drinks are really good! Especially the mimosas! Huge drinks by the way, ordered a cranberry juice and was surprised at how big it was. The prices are pretty low for such good food and the costumer service is pretty well also. I've never had an issue with the staff, in fact they remembered me the last time I went in which says a lot about the staff and how the restaurant manages. I like to sit on the outside patio, the seating is really comfortable and they have heaters in case it gets chilly. Plus they have huge television screens in front of the bar, which is always a plus. Definitely (if not already) going to be a regular. Try the fried mushrooms too!"}
{"text":"Great chicken . Prices are to high I believe . Parking is horrible . Unprofessional employees so loud . The area doesn't seem safe . I highly recommend trying a different location ."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Fast delivery. I ordered the typical Lo Lo chicken waffle. The food was good. There is no LoLos close by where I live so i dont have a chance to go there again"}
{"text":"Went to this location twice and both time received terrible service. Today I went and waited five mins at the counter before getting a greeting from any server after many walked passed me. I got seated next to a dirty table which remained dirty more than half the time I was there. I asked for a water and coffee and just got coffee no refill smh because I love lolos I wanted to give this one a shot since it's close to my job for lunch but guess I'll drive five more minutes to downtown or eat at Scottsdale location"}
{"text":"My husband had been here once before years ago. I had never been. We decided to stop in for lunch on our day off. we were told our wait would be 10-15 min not even sitting down 5 min we were told our table was ready. We walk to the back (chick'n coop) only to be told our table was not ready. So I sat down in the chair just outside the chick'n coop door only be to be told by the rude hostess (a Hispanic lady) that I could not sit and wait there I needed to go sit down in the front. As go sit in the front as I was told not even 50 seconds later I'm told you're tables ready. My husband had gone to the bathroom and I told the rude hostess I would wait for my husband to walk out of the bathroom before being seated so we could sit down in the chick'n coop together. The look she gave me said I was not supposed to do that. But I did anyways. We were seated and our waiter Steve I believe was his name came and got our drink order & after awhile our food order. I ordered the catfish my husband ordered the chicken & waffles. I asked for lemons for my catfish Steve never brought them to me I had to ask a table busser to bring me some. Steve came & refilled my husbands drink I still had some in my cup but by the time I was done Steve never came back another random gentlemen I think he was also a busser because I had seen him sweeping & cleaning off a table earlier. Offered to get me a refill, we revived our check & to go cups and left. The service was not very helpful or friendly in my eyes. The food was amazing I would only choose to go back for  he food. Not for the people. Maybe they will bone up on there service skills & people skills. The food I give 10 stars."}
{"text":"Anyone with a history of heart related issues should NOT dine here!

I've been to a number of chicken/waffle houses, and Lolo's can hang with the best of them.  The fried chicken has a good balance between greasy and juicy, with seasoning that isn't overpowering.  The waffles were fairly standard, but it's hard to really jazz up a waffle.  Add an ice cream scoop's worth of butter and syrup and you are good to go.
The mac and cheese was good, but not spectacular.

This spot is a little hard to find as it is on a very unassuming side street, so keep your eyes peeled."}
{"text":"I like Lo-Lo's!  The food is always good, love the atmosphere. I guess its cool that they're branching out around the Valley so that more people get to experience the yumminess. I will say, if you call yourself a REAL fan of Lo-Lo's, you must have at least 1 meal at the original location.  

Keep Chick-in on, Lo-Lo's!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Im glad I'm not following my diet. Heart attack in style . Love the people even though the lines are long some days. Its worth the wait"}
{"text":"First time here and it was very delicious!  I expected the waffles to be a lot crispier but overall the meal was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Great food and sweet tea. Awesome waffles awesome chicken awesome service!! Fun atmosphere that is great for anyone !!"}

They've been quite hit or miss in the 3 times I've been.
1st time = great chicken, wimpy waffle
2nd time = ok chicken, wimpy waffle
3rd time = charm

The chicken has been either perfectly seasoned and juicy or perfectly seasoned but overcooked.  Each time, the waffle has been flavorless and...pretty sad and limp.

Now the charmer?  Gizzards and rice!  Don't knock it before you try it.  Fried chicken grizzards in gravy and onions over white rice.  Trust me, there is nothing funny tasting or fretful about these gizzards.  Perfectly fried, perfectly seasoned, and the gravy is excellent.  Huge portions, too.  By far the best thing I've had here and a dish that would make me come back even if their chicken wouldn't.

Service has varied...but is usually on the non-chat'em up side of things.  Orders are taken fine, and we're tended to just fine.  But we haven't had really engaging hosts.  No big deal.

Price...well, its just the kind of place where you're gonna spend more than $15.  The portions are worth it in my opinion.

Nice place to sit in though...I like the openness of it.  NOT a lot of room so you'll be waiting a while, especially on Sundays."}
{"text":"Came after work today, only been here once before. There was about a 15 minute wait, I like how they have couches outside to wait, opposed to hard benches. Our waitress was really friendly and kept checking on us even though they were super busy. 
I had the LoLo's the 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles. The chicken was really crispy, not at all greasy and had perfect flavor, the waffles I really liked with the cinnamon inside kicked it up a notch on the flavoring which I really enjoyed. All in all the food is good, service good, I'll come back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm from LA, and I LOVE Rosco's Chicken and Waffles. I was apprehensive about this place, based on high expectations, which I hold from Rosco's. However, Lolo's was THE JAM! 
The parking = easier and better and safer than Rosco's (any location) 
The wait = only 20 minutes on a Saturday morning at 10am. Rosco's would have been at least 45 minutes. 
The service = friendly and welcoming. They had no intention of rushing us out of there, even though there was a wait list at the host stand. I could tell that our server (Sarah, I think) wanted us to have a comfortable, relaxing meal. 
The food = Just as good as Rosco's (which means, superb!). I ordered the #10, which is two chicken legs and a waffle. The chicken was insanely buttery and moist, with perfect crispy crust. The waffle was short, flat, covered in butter, and accompanied by piping-hot syrup. That's exactly how I like it. 
I also asked our server for an order of her favorite side dish, and she brought me a side of collared greens, which were the best I've ever had. They were buttery, crisp, and somehow spicy. I asked one of the other employees how they got the spice, and he said it's crushed red pepper flakes, though he seemed unsure. Whatever it is, it's heaven. 
This place is worth a trip, and definitely worth the cost. 
Thank you Lolo's!"}
{"text":"Love love love Lo Lo's. The service is awesome the food is spectacular and the serving sizes very generous.  They serve old fashioned kool aide and comfort food!. Make sure to get on the call list because this place is always busy but worth the wait, i am down for Lo Lo's any day of the week !"}
{"text":"It takes alot for me to frequent a restaurant numerous times, I believe that there are great places all over the city so why not take the time to try out new places. But LoLo's seems to be my cyptonite. It's an interesting blend of tastes, fried chicken and waffles on the same plate at the same time? 

However, do your taste buds a solid and check this place out.  The fried chicken is great, and the waffles are amazing. Red beans and rice, grits, and red velvet cake are great too. Still not satisfied...LoLo's has red kool-aid, not the kind mom made, but the kind you always wanted to make as a kid, remember, half sugar half water and a packet of kool-aid, served in a mason jar. How can you go wrong. Ch..Ch..Ch..Check it Out."}
{"text":"Went here on my Harley with a friend.  Fun place never had chicken and waffles before. They were pretty good.  The chicken was cooked great, big size pieces n only suggestion was they should have been seasoned a little better. The waffles are kind of thin but tasted good, the syrup they served was hot. The sweet tea is extremely sweet i hate to say it because i love sugar but it was really sweet. The wait staff and bartender were awesome.  Overall fun place,  and great ambiance."}
{"text":"I ordered the special: chicken, catfish with the sides of mac and cheese and greens. SO GOOD . The food is southern and so filling I took home half of my plate PLUS banana pudding, which I thought was alright. Good atmosphere, clean and very well worth it."}
{"text":"They went and did it again! 
There are restaurants and then there are \"MUST STOPS\" Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles in Phoenix is MUST STOP. This is why I've been here each time that I've been to PHX and I'll continue to come as long as the doors are open.

The Lo-Lo's Experience starts off AS USUAL, I'm greeted with a smile by one of the MANY, let me say it again, MANY beautiful staff members (fellas, fellas! !)
I take my seat and another smiling face arrives, Ms. Allison, she's aiming to please but I'm a pro so I don't dilly dally, Sweet Tea and water to drink and Fried Green Tomatoes for my appetizer. These things are AWESOME all by themselves, they come with a sauce of some sort but naah, a drizzle of hot sauce, IF YOU LIKE, either way, TRY THESE. The seasoned bread crumbs give the perfect crunch and that hot, moist tomato! Savory Goodness!

I could've ended it there but that would be disrespectful to myself. For the entree I get the Salmon Croquettes, Cole slaw, Mac and Cheese and a biscuit that I'm sure has broken up a few homes! (WARNING, IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW WE DO IT IN THE SOUTH, SKIP THE NEXT FEW SENTENCES!)
The croquettes are hot from the pan, a bit of a skin on the outside but piping hot, moist and flaky inside. I top them with SYRUP, yes & yes! 

The biscuits WILL be fought over during the reading of a will at some point. These things are the gold standard and they're ALWAYS consistent. Hot, soft but not doughy, a bit of flakiness but not falling apart and if, IF it makes it to the end of the meal, that last bite is just a good as when it first came out.

Tonight's drawbacks, the Mac and Cheese. 
I had to send it back 3 times because it just wasn't hot enough. They figured it out but by the time they got it right I was just about full and eating a side of Mac and Cheese solo just makes me feel 6 yrs old all over again. I couldn't do it.(No disrespect to any 6 yr olds reading this, give mom or dad the phone back please.)

The manager came out, explained what went wrong, adjusted my check and even brought me a sample of an upcoming menu item. They were SOLD OUT of the \"Sock It To Me\" cake.

If you love great food, great atmosphere and great service, THIS. IS. A. MUST. STOP."}
{"text":"Good food, crappy service.  First time I thought it was a fluke but I returned 2 more times and had the same experience with slow slow slow service."}
{"text":"Went there at 10 am, not crowded, we were greeted nicely, the staff was great & very \"nurturing\" when they found out we were 1st timers. Lets get right to the food!
RED DRANK (fruitkoolaid) wow, Im a guy who usually drinks lightly sweetened tea so this was a shock LOL  mucho koolaid packets + mucho sugar!  CHICKEN- done right! not greasy, just perfect! GREENS- honestly the best ive had MAC-N-CHEESE OMG i had high hopes, and they exceeded them! as a corn bread hater I even liked the cb muffin. WAFFLES- awesome also. NO WEAK LINKS HERE!
We plan on taking all the family when they come to town!
THE ONLY CON- didnt have a \"hood rich\" shirt in my size!"}
{"text":"My sister in law swears this is the best place for chicken & waffles! Ok so finally we decided to check it out... On a weekend, I suggest you show up early because it get pretty full. Anyway long story short the wait on the food was LOOONG at one point I thought we had been forgotten but 45 minutes later we got our food.  To my surprise it was extremely delicious! The chicken had an amazing flavor! The waffle was oh so good! I also tried the banana & caramel pancakes & I didn't regret it! 

I will be back (but earlier) I had to wait"}
{"text":"After being told \"hang on\" when we got there, and waiting 25 minutes to be seated (when there were tons of open tables, it wasn't busy at all), and then 8 more minutes for someone to even come to our table and offer us a drink, I can report my experience:

The menu itself has quite an unusual selection... However none of it is anything really that amazing and it isn't cooked to any kind of exceptional standard. I thought the prices were fairly high for what you get- everything has to be added for an extra cost. Our waiter was alright but he really tried to sell us on almost everything on the menu it seemed. Not at a used car lot, so I don't appreciate that.

Overall, LoLo's is something to talk about and it's definitely not your average place to eat. The problem however is that it just isn't very good, period."}
{"text":"Was disappointed when we ordered the catfish yesterday  it was slimmy and smelled super fishy.  Needless to say, we were both sick from just one bite each.  It was my order but when I tasted it I immediately felt the slimmy texture, unfortunately my husband tried it to be sure before we sent it back.  Hours later we were home sick.  Be careful when ordering the catfish here!"}
{"text":"Heart-stoppingly good!  Load up on your Lipitor, check your blood sugar level at the door, and sit down for some Southern style good eats.  We had various sides to go with our fried chicken, such as buttered grits, waffles, collard greens, and beans with rice.

The fried chicken had a salty, crispy, peppery crust with tender, juicy chicken.  I had a 3 piece platter which included a wing, breast, and thigh.  The chicken tasted great with the waffles in maple syrup and butter.  The collard greens were tender, with good smokey flavor and a hint of bitterness from the natural flavor of the greens.  The red beans and rice were decent, and the buttered grits were also decent.

As for drinks, I opted to wash my meal down with some sweet tea ($3).  The tea is very sweet and concentrated, but was tasty nonetheless.  Since it was so sweet, I could only take a few sips of it throughout the meal.  I also tried some red Kool-Aid, which was equally as potent.  If you like strong flavored drinks, this is your place!

Service was very friendly.  It was fairly busy on a Friday night and we had a little bit of a wait, but we didn't mind since it gave us time to look over the menu.  

If I ever have room in my stomach for more food after my main course, I'd definitely like to try some of their delicious desserts!"}
{"text":"Good fried chicken and wings.  They have a nicely crispy, crunchy, flavorful crust with juicy chicken on the inside.  Fries were quite tasty as well, crisp and soaked with the oil and honey from the chicken wings.  The grits were just OK, they were a little bland, and they tasted like the stuff you buy at the store.  The waffles that came with the chicken were very large, and served with butter and maple syrup.  I wasn't a big fan of the red velvet cake though.  It was a bit dry and crumbly."}
{"text":"Ebony K. warned me...but I think those waffles are starting to chin check me.  To welcome a new member to my team at work we went to Lolo's Chicken and Waffles. I was excited because I have seen many positive reviews. The prior reviews were on the money. This is one of the best places I have been to in town, on da rilla.

I ordered the very manly Betty Boop...which claimed \"one juicy breast and a waffle\" to that I added a side of cheese grits. Having lived in the ATL, I had to order the sweet tea - but red kool-aid on the menu? I ain't mad atcha!  I am somewhat of a sweet tea snob, but this tea was perfect. The restaurant was full with a small line waiting, but despite the traffic the order arrived quickly. Shots out to our waitress, Didi. We had five in our group and of course no one carried cash. The back of the menu says 18% gratuity for parties of 5 or more, no separate checks and no more than 2 transactions per table for parties of 5 or more. She made an exception and we each ordered individually. 

The waffles were bigger than I expected. A coworker mentioned they were thin, so I mistakenly assumed small. Not so. The waffle and the chicken were very filling. I thought the fried chicken was juicy with good flavor and the waffle was excellent. I could have lived without the cheese grits, but I had to order them. I haven't had grits too often here in the desert. This meal magically transported me back to my days in the ATL. They also sell t-shirts for $20 with a variety of ghetto slang. Before leaving I had to pick up the \"Barnyard Pimp\" shirt. Thaswutsup. 

I will definitely be back to this place! Lolo's is off the heezy fo sheezy!"}
{"text":"Maybe I had a bad batch. My chicken didn't seem fresh, nor did my waffle. Compared to Roscoe's, it is better. They try to copy here. I'll give it another try in a month"}
{"text":"My. Mother and brother I law had the pleasure of going to lolls on Wednesday and bringing me a plate back. What I can say is for a place that is supposed to be good... This food was awful. Burnt zucchini and mushrooms. The chicken tasted like fish because it appears they used the same grease... And the fish. Oh my word was burnt. It was so dark I and over cooked I can't believe they sent out he food that way. Whatever was going on in that kitchen wasn't working. The Mac and cheese tasted old..... I don't believe they will be going back and. I'll just stick with mrs's white cafe. Never had a bad plate of food yet"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. We were told it would be a 45 min wait but half the tables were open. Then the bartender told us to sit at one table and they would serve us there, but the waitress rudely told us to get up. They were not even apologetic about their service. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"We visited for bunch on a Monday there was a good size crowd inside and we got seated right away, they are usually packed on the weekend. The service and food was great!"}
{"text":"We have been here about 5 times and it is a good spot if you want fried chicken and waffles. I ordered the chicken sandwich once - wasn't the best.  The Kool-aid is really good, but it should be served with an insulin pump because it is super sweet! Overall, a great place but the wait is sometimes long on Friday nights especially."}
{"text":"Okay, for years I wondered what the fuss was about Lo-Lo's and always thought it was too $$ for just some chicken and waffles (i think at one point in the past i made comments to people about getting some KFC and eggos for less).  The husband had had it a few times, and had told me that the chicken was amazing.  Still it took me over 10 years to try them out.  

I decided to order and have it delivered using one of \"those\" apps.  I ordered C the Tre-Tre. Husband got the Puffs chicken tenders basket. I got the Lil Amadi. Also ordered a side of fried okra and mac & cheese. 

We got our order delivered.  

And...I took everything back about it being just \"some chicken and waffles\"!  The chicken. OMG. SO Freaking good!! Huge crunch factor to the skin. Meat was not dry. Just thinking about it now makes me want to pass over my lunch i brought to work and order some Lo-Los (it's right down the street from work). 

My only slight complaint would be about the okra.  There were a lot of pieces that were very very woody and inedible. other than that...everything was amazing!  

Looking forward to getting Lo-Lo's again..maybe today.  LOL"}
{"text":"OMG where do I begin.... Let's get the bad stuff out the way first... I waited almost an hour for my food because they had a big group in.... I was disappointed but the food was worth the wait!! The manager came over and gave me my meal free... That was a nice gesture to make the situation right...I ordered the 3 piece platter (I think that's what it's called) with cornbread and 2 sides (collard Greens and rice and butter) sweet tea... They even have kool aid on tap but u have to order by the color...lol... The food was worth the wait... Absolutely fantastic!!! One thing I love is that the greens are not seasoned with pork!!!! Definitely a plus"}
{"text":"Love Lo-Los but don't love the price. So expensive.   I have driven several times over 40 miles for their chicken.  It seems like a family run restaurant.  I love that you can get cool-aid just like when you were a kid.    It just goes to show you that  if the food is good you will drive way out of your way & pay way too much money for it."}
{"text":"I couldn't decide between three and four stars. I have visited twice and I will say my first experience was better. My second experience- service was horrible. We were seated ten minutes before anyone even came and asked us for a drink order. I actually had to wave someone down. The one that came over after I waved her down said she couldn't take our order because she wasn't our waitress. She said she would go find our server. Five minutes later, a lady came to our table and didn't have the best attitude. The staff just didn't seem to care too much about service and would be standing around gossiping amongst eachother when customers needed help. With that said, the food doesn't disappoint. If only the service could get on par with the menu, LoLo's would be somewhere I'd frequent."}
{"text":"BEST SOUTHERN SOUL FOOD IN AZ!  You got to try this.......

It was our first time at Lo-Lo's and lucky enough for us, we got to meet the owner and shake his hand.  I'm not sure how many times I told him how good the food was, but I know it was a lot of times.  He was probably thinking, this corn fed Midwestern white chic keeps telling me how good my grits are and I'm trying to spend time with the family.  

The service was very friendly, fun to chat with, and moved fast.

This is what we ordered  .........drum roll................ 

Na-Na's - Two waffles, two eggs, and a good helping of grits.  (I added a chicken breast to go with my waffles to this meal.)

Chicken Fried Chicken Dinner with greens, mac n cheese, and corn bread.  Chicken was smothered in sausage gravy.

Red Velvet Cake (to go)

STUPID Fries (to go)

Everything they had was (and looked) homemade, fresh, tasty, creamy, and oh so crispy.  (see photos)

Chicken was tender, crisp to perfection, and sultry.  Waffles were flaky and cinnamony.  Grits and the mac n cheese were creamy.  The greens had a major kick of spice to them and were not that spicy at the same time.  Corn bread was soft and crispy.  The cake was buttery yummy goodness.  And the Stupid Fries were, well, so good they will make you cross eyed.

Yes, I got a little bit of everything.  I wanted to try it all.  I got the cherry Kool-Aid to wash all this down too.  My bill was $50 for all that food, and it was worth every single penny."}
{"text":"Best chicken and waffles in the state, and I'd say the only competitor of Roscoes.
Best best ever!!! Can't get enough!!
Use hot sauce, use syrup, try the cornbread, grits, kool-aid. 
5/5"}
{"text":"Seriously hands down my favorite restaurant in Phoenix! Besides the bad service they provide, the food is amazing! You won't go home hungry and it will make you even forget about the bad service that was provided! Lolo's is in business for a reason!"}
{"text":"I have such mixed feelings for Lo-Los, and I really think you should take the time to read my rant to peep you for your journey. 

Food: I absolutely love their waffles and mac -- I have never been disappointed by these two. As for their fried chicken... hit or miss. I have eaten the juiciest, crispest pieces of meat at this restaurant and other times, the chicken has been less than par. My advice is to go for lunch. You will definitely have a better shot of eating the best fried chicken in AZ. 

Atmosphere: the interior is really well done. The decorations, tables, menus tie together to bring the southern food together. However, the location is difficult to find and I personally think the upgrades to the Scottsdale location made the restaurant more commercialized. 

Service: everyone is really nice....but they have terrible execution. I'll just say, Our appetizers came out after we had finished our meal.... so don't expect top notch service or maybe don't order appetizers. Your call."}
{"text":"Typically busy but I love the mason jar kool-aid,  old school hip hop and the yummiest chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Having lived in LA most of my life I had a difficult time finding the comfort foods Phoenix had to offer. LoLo's has taken the concept (I think) Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles created to a new level. A must have."}
{"text":"Shrimp & grits!!  WOW!!!  Great place!  Great staff and amazing food!  Ya gotta get there!!"}
{"text":"Lived in the South for a bit and WOW... this place took me back!!!  Great REAL southern food and who could be dissatisfied with a place who will sell \"Jar o drink\" Koolaid in a mason jar.  I've been multiple times and will keep going back!  Great food and the atmosphere is right on."}
{"text":"I have been to Lo-Lo's about 5 times.  The food was amazing and service was fine.  Recently I brought a friend to the Phoenix location and it was a very different experience.  I anticipated a wait to be seated when it's a Sunday morning.  I did not expect to wait for almost an hour to get our food.  We waited for another 20 to 25 min after asking for the check.  In total once we had been seated we probably stayed there for 2 and half hours (mostly just waiting). I am not going to lie, our appetizer came out pretty quick, but I can only assume that after that we were completely forgotten about. Our food was cold once we finally got our main course and we may have mentioned something to the waitress if we ever saw her again. The lady disappeared so we had zero refills and just sat there thirsty.  No manager apologized for the wait or anything. Finally she came back we asked for our check and it was wrong.  She \"fixed\" it and it was still wrong.  After we left we couldn't help but laugh about how bad the experience was. Maybe try the Gilbert location if your hungry."}
{"text":"For all the hype food was completely underwhelming and way overpriced .. An employee was very  rude to a customer who has a  service dog as well."}
{"text":"As good as it gets is right! I always enjoy visiting Scottsdale, Arizona and stopping at Lo-Lo's. There is never no waits. Their employees are very friendly. The food is amazing. I ordered the Tre-Tre with two pieces of chicken with a golden waffle and flushed it down with Kool-Aid in a mason jar. It was fantastic! I can't wait for Spring Training to start so I can make my way back to Lo-Lo's."}
{"text":"I'm from LA, home to Roscoe's chicken and Waffles, and I heard from my friends that Phoenix Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles out beats Roscoe's. Without a doubt they were right.....This establishment over exceeds Roscoe's food. I ordered the Ivan's Chorizo and Eggs and my friend ordered their famous Lo-Lo's #3. I was amazed over their chorizo quality and the way it was cooked; the tortilla was warm and fluffy. The FRIED CHICKEN was tender and juicy; I definitely could not have asked for better food then what Lo-Lo's had to offer. I would encourage everyone who visits Phoenix to make Lo-Lo's a priority when eating out."}
{"text":"Well ,.my first time here my husband ordered pork chops and eggs I ordered the DD . after we finished our first cup of coffee waiter came and told us out of chops ugh so he ordered an omelet . Food was great service was terrible had to ask 3 times to fill my cup"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times and I'm never ever satisfied.. The service sucks, u can't substitute eggs for anything. I bring people here but it fails me every time and the hostesses have bad attitudes.. If u want some ghetto service and a long wait while sitting at the travel this is the place for u..!"}
{"text":"Do not eat here if you are on a diet. Eat here if you want some damn good chicken and waffles! The food is rich and delicious. 

I love the combination of sweet and savory. Also try the mac n cheese and sweet tea. So good! 

You'll need to be patient because this isn't fast food. It's fun to sit here with friends if you have an hour-and-a-half for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of chicken and waffles.  This location is a upgrade from the phoenix location. For the california people, this is not roscoes chicken and waffle but it it is a arizona alternative.  If you are in scottsdale and want some pretty good southern food go to Lolo's.  

P.S. Don't forget to order koolaide it come in a large mason jar.  If you are diabetic you should not order this or the sweet tea.  It might kill you."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The chicken and waffles are good.  But many people miss out because they do not order the shrimp and grits dish.  The shrimp and grits was the best I ever had."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Lo-Lo's. It was really good but prepare to spend your time there. lol it was about 2 + hours by the time we were seated ordered and ate; they forgot the potatoes with my breakfast and we waited about 30 mins for them to bring them out. It was only my husband and I so not a huge complicated order. 

Drinks are super expensive at $3.50 each for a simple soda not one of the specialty teas or lemonades, but they did let us take a refill out  to go when I asked. 

Other comment the patrons are LOUD- we were in one of those half booths with people about 2 feet away on the long bench who were cackling loudly when they laughed. They were a table of 4 and they were obnoxiously loud. I shot them a couple looks like really??? Not necessary to be that loud when you laugh and talk. We left with a headache. When they got a phone call at the table they took the call and the other 3 toned it down a little so the person could talk, so clearly they were.Capable. But the person who took the call and had a whole conversation on the phone spoke super loudly. Oy vey!

The chicken was Crispy and tender the waffles got soggy since they were stacked on each other but the flavor was decent. My egg over easy was good. My husband got the chicken omelette with a waffle and that was very good. Potatoes were decent, not many on the order but not sure they were worth a 40 min wait!"}
{"text":"Went to Lo-Lo's for lunch to try the Phoenix version of chicken and waffles. I ordered the Toy Toy and added 2 wings to the meal. I'm actually glad that I ordered 2 additional wings because my wings seemed pretty small to me. I have had chicken and waffles from the east all the way to the west and these were just ok to me. I would certainly go back and try other dishes and encourage all who have never been to check them out. The lemonade happened to be my favorite part this time around with the perfect blend of lemons and brown sugar."}
{"text":"Went to visit a friend in Phoenix and she took me to this place. I adore chicken and waffles and I can't help but get it every chance I get! I had the tray-tray? which included 2 fried drumsticks and a waffle. I added a side of mac and cheese & eggs scrambled with cheese (I LOVE CHEESE). I made sure to put the Lo-Lo sauce on my chicken (it's their version of hot sauce). Everything was so delicious!! Topped off my meal with a glass of Kool-Aid! I asked the waitress what flavors they had and she replied \"red, blue and grape!,\" I had to ask if those were the colors or the flavor, then she gave me the flavors...can you say RACHET?! Anyway, everyone there was pleasant and I enjoyed my meal. Will definitely be back whenever I am in the Phoenix area =)"}
{"text":"Lo Lo's was great! Chicken was tender and waffles were the bomb dignity! You won't go home hungry! Great scene, hip-hop/R&B playing and food smell.  Carl was the best waiter any took great care of us. We will be back"}
{"text":"Drum stick, pecan waffles, cheese fries, and a big jug of sweet tea to wash it down with. Service is alway friendly and if they mess up an order they fix it right away without any questions. Their prices are a little high so I go every once in awhile."}
{"text":"Soul food done right with a fun atmosphere. Been here several times for brunch and dinner and it's all good. Especially liked the catfish and candied sweets."}
{"text":"It was my first time in Phoenix, so I couldn't possibly pass up on the opportunity to check out this highly recommended restaurant!

Ambiance - Fun! They played 90s Hip-Hop the whole time, including some of our favorite throwback songs. Unfortunately, I don't have much to say about the interior since my table and I decided to sit in the patio.

Service - We chose to face the heat and sit outside to skip the line. The server was friendly and personable, making our experience a great one!

Food - I ordered the Betty's Boob. I'm always hesitant about ordering chicken breast because it is more likely to be dry compared to other options, but it was incredibly moist and flavorful! The waffle was crisp and soft on the inside and their syrup complemented the meal well.

Drinks - Bottomless mimosas for $12! Being my first time in Arizona, it probably wasn't a good idea for me to mix alcohol and heat, but it was definitely worth it. Also, THEY HAVE KOOL-AID ON TAP. I didn't order it, but it's a pretty fun fact.

Pricing - Average of a meal is ~$10, but can stretch to two meals because their serving sizes are huge!

Parking - They have a small lot that could easily get full on busy days, but there is street parking around."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The servers are great. The hostesses are not informed on what's going on. But the reason I'm giving them a 1 star review is because the manager, Mils, (I believe that was his name and as he informed me, he's the ONLY manager they have) is quite possibly the rudest, most condescending person ever. Dude, you're in the industry of CUSTOMER service. Learn how to properly interact with people. I will NEVER go back based on him, solely him. I tell everyone I know not go there because of him. I have never been treated so poorly after making a reservation for 20 3 weeks in advance and being told upon arrival that they had no table ready because no one had made a reservation when their hostess had called literally an hour and a half before to confirm that we were still coming. He was so incredibly rude about it, talked down to me telling me I didn't know what I was talking about, I was wrong and I must have made up the reservation until I played him the message from the hostess at which point, he just walked away. The owner stepped in and asked tables to move so they could get our group in.. We still waited for over 45 minutes. UGH, I work in the restaurant industry, I can NOT imagine treating people this way and expecting them to return. SO BAD. I would highly suggest improving your customer service skills, Mils. You're awful."}
{"text":"LoLo's is ALL THAT AND A BAG OF CHIPS!!! Wonderful food...great service...and a clean and comfortable environment. We have been frequenting LoLo's since it was just a small, relatively unknown business and let's be clear - there's a reason that it has flourished. The food! Yes...yes...yes! The food is absolutely wonderful and if chicken and waffles aren't your thing (you should try it) there are plenty of other options available. And note this...they have kool-aid. What restaurant do you know that serves kool-aid? So much to love about LoLo's! Go and find out for yourself!"}
{"text":"We got to the restaurant early and missed all the parking drama that comes with this location.  There was also no wait!  SCORE!  I was not impressed, however, with the hostess who tried to seat my family of five at a small table barely large enough for four.  Thankfully she didn't put up a fuss when I asked if we could have the next table over that was a more appropriate size.  She was clearly agitated by needing to go get a cloth and wipe it down.  Bruce to the rescue!  He saw that she was about to mess this up, took the rag from her, got us seated and ensured that the remainder of our experience was fabulous.  The food was great, which is really what brings us back time and time again to LoLo's.  So this visit gets a 5 despite a somewhat questionable start."}
{"text":"\"Shoulda gone to Chick Fil-a\" was what my husband said after spending 2 hours (1.5 hrs of waiting time)

Food was just ok. The chicken was pretty flavorful but inconsistent. I got one small leg and then a giant breast the size of a football. How they fried that sucker to be fully cooked is a mystery. The waffles are like Eggos. Nothing mind blowing. Maybe we've been spoiled with our homemade Belgian waffles.

The staff, including the manager was super friendly but everything in this restaurant was just so friggin slow, not to mention the ridiculous wait on a Monday night.

Overhyped. That's all I'm gonna say."}
{"text":"Hnngh.
huuuuuuhhhhhhh.

Fried chicken, waffle, greens, catfish. Can never move again. I am OK with that. Ordered one piece of catfish, two came out, \"because they were a little small\". Best food of this particular expedition to Phoenix, and there are still a couple days left in my trip. This will be hard to beat, though.

Chef May? About your place down in Tucson? Yeah this is what you're trying to achieve. Please come take notes.

This is a silly thing to be happy about, perhaps, but I am always slightly irritated when I get a 6oz plastic tumbler stuffed with ice and a few drops of water. I drink water, a lot of it, and I don't normally get other drinks. Good service, an extra cup, a pitcher at the table, these are all things that can mitigate this. Lo-Lo's sidesteps it completely by providing 1L mason jars of water (I believe I saw kool-aid too) by default. I didn't even need a refill.

I was so massively over-full that I couldn't try the red velvet cake but I'm almost considering driving back down there and getting a piece to go, the way other yelpers go on about it."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure about returning to location due to a horrible waiter that we encounter not once but 3xs. The DM asked us to please return once more to make up for the waiter. It took a few months but we did return. Aaron was our waiter and was amazing. Glad we decided to give it another try at this location. Thank you so much! Would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time trying chicken n waffles definitely nothing to write home about. Fried chicken was ok and waffle average at best. They do have good hot sauce."}
{"text":"So this was my second time at LoLo's in Scottsdale....and OMG I still think they have the best tasting fried chicken out there...but what really impressed me this time was the customer service.  Not only from my waiter but the hostess was really helpful as well!  Not only did they meet all my needs but they anticipated my needs which really blew my mind.  If they keep that up they will be BIG as they plan to franchise because the food is good and the service is GREAT!  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK STAFF AT LOLO'S!"}
{"text":"Finally made it out.  Tried Mrs. White's one day, and then here the next day.  It was interesting contrasting what mother and son do differently, which is basically everything.

First off, this is a modern, chain-type restaurant.  I'd mistakenly thought it was more of a fast food place where you order and pick up yourself, but was disappointed to learn it's waitered.  It's expensive enough as is and I didn't really appreciate having to tip on top of that, but it does keep a lot more people employed.

Service was extremely cordial and friendly and employees seem to be having a great time at work, which is a treasure to find.  I think I saw LoLo himself (lol) counting his cash at the register, and he sho 'nuf looks happy as all get out so I guess he's doing well for himself.  The t-shirts are great.  The ambiance works much better than Mrs White's, where you feel more like you're in a soup kitchen for the homeless.

The food?  Well, the mac and cheese was heavenly - that had to be Velveeta, it was so creamy and thick.  My heart almost stopped for two reasons: the taste AND the cholesterol.  I opted for chicken tenders instead of the fried because I didn't feel like dealing with the bones.  So, 3 tenders and a very thin waffle for 12 bucks means I won't be back soon.  Too bad, too, because it's fun and good.  The menu has so many options, it took me a good 10 minutes to decide what to order.  There's so many other things I'd like to try - perhaps down the line, the next time I visit AZ.

I can think of some better fried chicken here in SoCal but I still say give this a shot.  You may end up loving it."}
{"text":"So amazingly delicious.  Every time I go there I have to get the, of course, chicken and waffles!!  And my boyfriend and I share a side of home fries which are just, the potatoes are crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside, and seasoned to perfection!  Someday I will branch out and try their other menu items, I'm sure you can't go wrong no matter what you order here!

Pro tip:  Make sure you bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"Just paid a visit to this *new* location in Scottsdale. 

My group of friends wasn't sure if it would be as good as the \"original\", but when we walked in we were amazed at the decor, very different from the original if you've been. 

That had our hopes pretty high, and we picked a seat and got our drinks rather quickly. Apparently a fresh batch of chicken was coming out of the fryer, so we waited patiently about 15 min. for our meals to come out. 

I got the Betty Boop ($7) and a side of corn bread, plus a lemonade the bill ran me $15 with a tip. As some have said, it's a little steep, but I've been here before and it is a TON of food. 

Anyways, the service was really great, they can't control how fast the food gets out most of the time. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I've been to the Scottsdale location and to this one a few times, but I guess I never reviewed this one :-\

Anyways, one of my hometown friends drove in from San Diego and displeased with his Roscoe's experience, was dying to go to LoLo's. Luckily we made it out of the Science Center in enough time to get lunch here before they closed for the day. We were quickly seated and taken care of. Our food came out quickly and we dove in. It was delish as usual and my friend said that LoLo's won that battle. 

That said, if you want some good fried chicken and waffles, head here."}
{"text":"\"Jews and Catholics are the only people with soul\" according to a friend.  Since I can't alter my birth or upbringing at this late date, perhaps I could buy some soul, become a whole person... the friendly folks at Lo-Lo's were quick to help me try.  Sorry, it doesn't work that way - I could buy happiness in the form of a tender waffle and tasty smothered chicken, but only my belly felt appreciably fuller, not my teeny heart.  My shallow thoughts were of how the waffle beat Roscoe's, but not the plumb but plainly seasoned & fried breast.  I wasn't moved to any emotion deeper than my jelly jar of beautiful red luscious Kool Aid/punch."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time here. The first time i ordered shrimp and grits and the second time i ordered there salmon croquettes in which i didn't care for neither. This time i ordered there smothered chicken, waffle and fried okra which was awesome. I would of gave them 4 stars but there waitresses sucks. They have attitude and not very personable."}
{"text":"Sat down no issues got our drinks no issues. Made our order and nothing for over 45 min. Cancel our order unreal. Place was not busy oh well"}
{"text":"This place is garbage and smells like piss the chicken gave me diaharria of the mouth yes of the mouth and it was full of black folk I would never come back again unless I was really hungry and don't forget only in America!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Suck my ass                                                                   Bring back obama"}
{"text":"Chicken + Waffles = food coma.

I ordered the Lo Los which is 2 waffles and 3 pieces of fried chicken. It's really unhealthy but this is some good comfort food. The fried chicken here is the best fried chicken I've ever tasted. The waffles are good and everything wasn't that greasy and I skipped the butter. Those SNL guys should have said \"Fried Chicken + waffles = crazy delicious.\" 

I did order the mac and cheese but to me it's the same everywhere else. I must say it should be recommend you burn 5000 calories before and after going."}
{"text":"The closest thing to Roscoe in AZ. Definitely worth the drive to downtown to eat here.  Great service met with great southern food."}
{"text":"This was the second time i came here and the food was a lot better than the first time. The only problem this time was the wait. I was with a group of four and we got seat right away, but it took roughly 30 minutes for someone to get our drinks ready. This place has great food but the waiting time can be pretty long."}
{"text":"Everything has been stated so far, it's a guilty pleasure and you leave fat and happy. I twittered that I couldn't move after eating there, and they actually wrote back to me, lol. The only thing that wasn't perfect was that my chicken breast was kind of dry. I know dark meat would probably be juicier so I will try that next time."}
{"text":"Who would have thought that I could find me some great comfort food in PHX?! This place has great service and really delicious food! I had the chicken combo platter with mac & cheese and waffles as sides. It came with cornbread and I washed it down with sweet tea! Bliss!"}
{"text":"First off it took the hostess 10 minutes to seat us because she couldn't get of the phone! Or have another team member help her. After being sat and getting drinks are server was very helpful.  Once we ordered the food took over 20 minutes and it was not busy. To make it worse my girlfriends food came first and I had to wait another 7 minutes for mine. We had also ordered chili fries that came out 10 minutes after I received my food! The chili was terrible and her side of string beans and red potatoes was straight out of the can . However the chicken was great. Otherwise it was a terrible experience. I would never go back unless someone else was paying."}
{"text":"I love Lo-lo's!! 
The phone number reaches the managers office as opposed to the takeout desk. Which is no help when placing a to-go order. Please fix this!"}
{"text":"I am pleasantly surprised ! a few years ago the corn bread and Mac & cheese weren't good at all . I was here earlier and i cleaned my plate ! they definitely changed the recipes and improved on some things . The staff was friendly enough and the place seemed clean . I'm not mad at about . I'd still choose Roscoe's any day"}
{"text":"Slap-Yo-Mamma fantastic!!! I'm going to write Yelp and have them invent another star just for them.....a sour apple star to match their awesome blends of Cool-aid.

We had the chicken and waffles that is worth flying across the county just to have a meal. Chicken perfectly seasoned and crispy, but not oily. Don't know how they do it but Southern perfection.....oops sorry to my Southern brothers but Phoenix got Yo whooped#

Easily the best meal, let alone breakfast I've had in a long time. If you are in Phoenix rush to get you some!"}
{"text":"I came to Phoenix for the weekend and decided to try Lolo's. I am from California and a huge fan of Roscoe's but I will say that this place was definitely a hit! Our waitress Marisella was so attentive and sweet. She did a phenomenal job of making sure we were happy! I got the Lolo's chicken and waffles. Not a huge fan of the mac and cheese but the waffles were amazing! Also had the sweet tea and the blue cool aid which I highly reccomend. Overall, a great experience and I cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great food. Great service. A great place to grab a bite not far from
Airport."}
{"text":"Oh yummy! I really liked this place but I'm surprised by the not so great reviews. We've been a couple times and it's always really tasty. I love the décor and the service is always really friendly. I always get a couple of drum sticks and a waffle. MmmMm! Not much more to say other than I've always had a great experience and look forward to going again soon."}
{"text":"This is the best place for a cheat meal! I haven't eaten a single thing here that I didn't love! My fiance even has a hat with their logo! Gotta love LoLo's"}
{"text":"Not sure what people are expecting from chicken.

I have been to the Scottsdale location 3 times now.
\And every time we have had zero issues.
We get seated right away.  The server was at the table taking drink orders within 4 mins.
We got our drinks fairly quick. Sure the order sometimes takes a little longer...but I am ok with that. because every time I eat the chicken, I always tell myself it was worth the wait :)
Its always hot and very tender.  Sometime I scraps off the meat from one of the huge legs, onto my waffle..cover in syrup, and eat that way.

Yum!!"}
{"text":"Slap yo momma good ! 
Best fried chicken I've ever had and I'm not a big fried chicken fan but it was awesome !!!! Waffles & chicken ? Yep they ARE a good combo in fact ! Chili cheese fries are some of the best I've had. 
The chili didn't have all the chunky veggies in it yet it had so much yummie flavor ! 
I hate veggies so that worked out of me ;) 
I would definitely go back ! Yum yum"}
{"text":"First time at Lo-Lo's today and excited to go back. Chicken and waffles were delicious and the atmosphere and service were great!"}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles. YUM. The decor of this restaurant was very \"southern\".  I love how friendly and welcoming the staff were.  I loved the music that was playing because it got me singing along. I ordered their fruit punch.. and wow, it was a big mason jar of cool-aid (free refills). YUM!!!!! I also ordered a side of corn with my waffle and chicken (thigh and drumstick).  I have been to Roscoe's in Long Beach, but honestly, I think Lo-Lo's Chicken hit the spot.  Their chicken was very moist, the batter of the chicken was light, airy, and crunchy.  The chicken was not over seasoned either. It was theeeeeeeee perfect fried chicken for me. Definitely will come back when I am in Arizona."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Lo-Lo's for a while now and let me tell you this place did not disappoint. There are so many great reviews I don't have much to add. 

Here's what I loved:
I saw Shaq walking out when I was coming in
They serve Kool Aid and strong a$$ ice tea in mason jars
The fried chicken must have crack in it - so juicy and delicious, you know it's bad for you but you keep coming back.. Just one more hit 
Fried okra rocks
Waffles are slightly sweet and cinnamony and who woulda thought to throw some fried chicken on top!

This is not the sort of joint to frequent if you care at all about your waistline, but when you want to indulge go to Lo-Lo's, get the fried chicken on a waffle and try not to go in to a coma before you leave."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place for awesome waffles! The fried chicken is good and they have the best Kool aid served in mason jars.  The portions are good the biscuits and gravy are really good.  They do have long waits though.  They offer valet parking but if you go early on a Saturday or Sunday morning before 9AM you will get seating right away."}
{"text":"I really don't know how to rate Lolo's, because, frankly, this place killed me.  It was only temporary, but I was definitely dead, heart stopped, for a solid five or six seconds.  

Lolo's is serious eats.  So good, it was just painful.  Literally.  I really don't think I can return anytime soon.  I know it's for the best.

I'm nowhere near joking."}
{"text":"This place is great!! It was 5 of us and we were ALL very pleased with service and specially the food, Mmmm southern chicken, 1 waffle, a side of southern potatoes with gravy, and a corn bread muffin..  Everything cooked to perfection.. Definitely coming back..  Thanks Lo-Lo's Great job!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE LOVE this location for some reason we feel at home at this place. The staff are very friendly and the food is amazing I love the GRITS. It's usually very busy when we come but it's worth the wait.  TRY the Kool-Aid  they have a Scottsdale location but I really don't care for that location"}
{"text":"We went on Mothers Day, very busy!  We waited about 40 min for our table....once we were seated & placing our drink order our waitress Amane made sure we were aware that the wait time for food was about 45 min., if we were ok with that!  We were and placed our food order.... We received our meals in about 35 min. (I timed it). The meal were very good... Well seasoned and tasty! Our server was very good... kept our drinks filled, checked on us from time to time!  I really appreciated the fact she let us know ahead of time that the food would take along time, so if we had further plans we could leave, If we needed to.... She was very thoughtful!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed by the lack of customer service at Lo Los.  Me and a friend waited like 15 minutes to be seated which wasn't bad. 10 minutes after being seated we were told by the waitress that she would be right with us. 5 minutes later she comes to take our drink order. 10 minutes later we order our food. 10-15 minutes after the waitress comes to say there are no greens which totally messed up the whole meal. We ask for the manager. Carlos comes over and says it would be 15 minutes for greens and there won't be a problem.  Carlos then comes right back and says it will be an hour for greens. No apology no type of compensation for the huge issue. So we suggest a complimentary margarita in the meantime and Carlos looks at us crazy and says \"on the house\" like it was an unimaginable request.  After he dismisses the suggestion he  tries to sweet talk us into string beans. We agree. 25 minutes later we notice two tables seated AFTER us and one has greens. We then call Carlos over and tell him what we have recognized and he argues with us saying we haven't been there an hour because the waitress put the order in 25 minutes ago and it was placed after the two tables that arrived after us. Needless to say they lost two customers today."}
{"text":"Bomb ass chicken and waffles. I ordered the shrimp and grits to go. I just feel like eating more when I get home, so I figured I'll keep the LoLo's party going :) 

Great service as well :)"}
{"text":"I had been craving fried chicken for I don't know how long. When we checked in to the Holiday Inn and I saw the \"chicken and waffles\" sign next door, I knew we were there. 

First of all, they serve Kool-aid...need I say more?

Ordered the Lo Lo plate (3pc chicken w/waffles). The chicken was really, really good, juicy and crispy. The waffles were good. Maybe could have used a bit more butter and syrup, but not a disappointment. 

Everyone was pleased with their meal. The plates were all mounding and the service was fine. The bill seemed a little high, but was worth it to quench that fried chix craving.

And did I mention they have Kool-aid?"}
{"text":"I used to go a lot at the old Scottsdale location. The new location just doesn't feel right; it's way too fancy!  It feels like a hip restaurant with the light fixtures and flooring. I liked going before it became a big franchise. The service is terribly slow; it took almost 30 minutes for our food to arrive. The gizzards were very bland, and the batter had no flavor. I also has the 3-piece chicken meal with 2 waffles. The chicken was very greasy and not crispy. One of my pieces of chicken was red inside.  (There is a photo!) The waffles are the reason why I come, and they're totally different now! They weren't sweet and soggy instead. I am so disappointed that this place sold out."}
{"text":"The food here is spectacular. The only thing that I don't really like that much is the parking. It kinda sucks and it is next to a hotel...so people will park there too. Despite the bad parking, I would still come back and enjoy delicious chicken and waffles. This is my first time eating it and I don't how I have never tried this godly combination. 

I recommend this place for delicious fried chicken. Much better than KFC or whatever. The service did suck, however. I'd give this place 4 if our waiter seemed like he gave a fuck."}
{"text":"I have been craving some soul food for quite some time, so I kicked and screamed til someone finally took me to Lolo's. After memorizing the menu for weeks, I knew I wanted the Baby Ray. So we go in and I was overjoyed that they had a band playing some sweet grooves. I jammed out a lil while waiting for about 10 minutes. We were seated in a nice lil half booth/table combo and had a huge jar of koolaid and sweet tea delivered to us. Yum! I starting getting the biggest sugar rush halfway through the wait. When my food did arrive, I was presented with two waffles bigger than my face, 3 big pieces of chicken smothered in enough gravy and onions to fill a whole gravy boat. The chicken was spectacular, really good flavor and crisp(when not soaked in gravy, get it on the side?). Gravy was pretty good as well.  The waffles were alright, I can't say I am the biggest waffle fan, but the subtle cinnamon flavor was nice. I think the waffles could have been better in my opinion. I am kicking myself for not trying the grits and collared greens or the red velvet cake. I could not finish my second waffle though, so much food, couldn't even think. The service was probably a B-. The hostess was bubbly and sweet. Our server was busy and a little frazzled maybe. The server gave us the wrong change and seemed to not believe that she had. Waiting for the correction was longer than average for sure. Overall, though, I had a good time, perfect way to end my weekend."}
{"text":"Fried chicken was good, but everything else was a joke.  The service was unbelievably bad.  The waffles were skinny and underdone.  First cup of grits had a tiny amount of butter and were way overdone, like they were scrapped out of the bottom of the pan.  When a second waitress saw what was in my bowl, and saw my dry ass overdone eggs (this was 5 minutes after they were brought out....I was still waiting for the chicken and waffles) she offered to bring new eggs and grits.  Second round, (still no chicken and waffles) eggs were much better but grits were underdone and watery.  When the chicken and waffles showed up, the waffles were already cool with no browning at all.  Coffee was terrible.  Wife's plate was just as bad.  Our original waitress never bothered to check on us until she brought the bill.  And to top it all off, the food is way overpriced, and over hyped!!!
The one solid was the chicken.  It was lightly battered and perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The scrambled eggs were real, not the fake crap.  I just wish someone in the back new how to cook them properly.  With the exception of the one waitress who replaced my first plate, it seemed like no one there, including the cooks, really gave a shit about the food or the service.  Very disappointing considering all the good reviews."}
{"text":"Nah.  Went in on a weekday at lunch. Place was half full.  Hovered at the hostess stand for a minute or two, hostess comes over and says she'll be right with us, leaves again.Waited a few minutes, she never comes back, so we go to the bar.  Bartender (D.R.?) is a really nice guy, helps us with the menu, takes our order.  There's some games on, and we enjoy talking to D.R., but after a while we notice our food's taking quite a while.  Bartender goes to rattle someone's cage, and it finally comes out, stone cold.  Greasy food does not go down well when it's cold!  Had it been hot, it probably would have been pretty good.  

Lots staff standing around in there, and our visit there were definitely some other impatient customers.  Big ups to D.R. for being a true gentleman, and for being the only one in the place who didn't have his head up his ass."}
{"text":"Major disappointment. 

Chicken was nearly inedible. Thick layer of crust was oily and tasted ... well, oily. No spices, just the taste of oil; extremely dry and bland and I couldn't come close to finishing it. 

Not sure if it had been cooked a couple days earlier and just heated up or if the cooking oil needs to be changed more frequently. Whatever it was, this was just flat out lousy. They should be embarrassed. 

Waffle was a waffle, like every other waffle I've ever eaten. Nothing special. 

Service was not terrible but not good either. Guy sat us outside, I asked if he could take our drink order, he said \"no, but I'll have someone out in 2 seconds\". 

NOTE TO ALL:  2 seconds in LoLo time = 10+ minutes human time."}
{"text":"We were told this place rivals Roscoe's so I had to give it a try. I'm a fan of Bonnie Jean's here in San Diego so this place has a lot to live up to. It is not as good as everyone says it is. The chicken was dry and the waffles weren't very flavorful. The sweet tea was way way way too sweet and the fried okra wasn't very good. The greens were delish and I did enjoy the wings that my friend shared with me. I also really liked the gizzards and gravy. The gravy is what gives this place a solid 3 stars...along with the very friendly wait staff!"}
{"text":"I had the Betty Boob and my husband had the Toy-Toy. Both were pretty good, wings a little dry. We shared a side of biscuits and gravy and it was to DIE for!! So good! The music was a little loud but overall the visit was great! Will be back."}
{"text":"I seriously must live in a hole. I didn't even know that somebody, no--- some GENIUS put together fried chicken and waffles until I came across Lo-Lo's on Yelp. Blew my mind.

Went on a weekday night but the place was still packed. The interior feels kind of a like an industrial diner but it definitely fit the type of food that is served. Ordered a couple mason jars of Red (this is a must have) for the group and several orders of the Lo-Lo, which is 3 pieces of fried chicken over 2 waffles. Really, really tasty and nothing could wash it down better than Red.

Only thing I wished is that they used the big cupped, Belgian style waffles (I don't even know if that is the right term). I think I would have enjoyed it more than Eggo style waffles. Maybe they have it and I overlooked it on the menu. Not really a huge deal though.

Excited to come back and try something else."}
{"text":"Love the fact that they have kook aid! Fried tomatoes were delicious and so was the chicken. Biscuits and gravy were a little. All the servers were friendly, everything was clean and overall a great ambience."}
{"text":"Thank you so much Lo-Lo's! I've been suffering from morning sickness for the past few weeks so eating has not been my favorite activity lately. After being in bed most of the day, I was craving some comfort food. And boy need y'all come through for me! Not to mention our server Bre was super sweet and professional. My two year old son also took a liking to her. He said he liked her hair and she was pretty. Y'all will probably be seeing me often."}
{"text":"My Husband and I have never been to Lo Lo's Chicken and Waffles before, however we visited this location today. We have heard that the food is awesome so we were very excited to try this place. We walked in to only a few tables being used and no one at the hostess stand (around 2pm) that's fine. We sat down and waited to be greeted and seated. About 15 minutes later a lady comes by and asks \"how many?\" We responded with \"HELLO, it's two and a baby.\" She then grabs two menus and walks away. My husband then asks \"we follow you right?\" In which she nods her head yes(no smile no nothing). So we sit down. We understand sometimes being busy some restaurants won't have the best customer service but this place was not busy at all. Then we remind her we need a high chair. She then appears bothered and yells at a man to bring the high chair. The guy really puts the cherry on top of any already bad experience (heavy set Hispanic male with some tattoos). He comes over and slams the high chair, my husband thanks him anyways and his attitude towards our \"thank you\" was really nasty.  At this point we really wanted to try the food here however the not so good service from not just one person but two had us go else where for our lunch, which is really disappointing."}
{"text":"Food is great! We have a great time every time we go here. The waffles are delicious! I haven't had anything bad. The sauteed spinach and fried chicken are my favorite. We always leave  full and happy!"}
{"text":"First time there... The atmosphere is nice. Fun drinks. But food was drowning in grease! I'm a huge foodie but I couldn't eat my meal (grits and shrimp). Just the taste of so much grease with every bite made it hard. 
I was really excited to try this place so I might go back and give it another try but at a different location. ( I went to the one close to downtown )"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to try this place out but was closed on the 4th of July, went back on Sunday at 10:30am but couldn't do the 45 minute wait  outside under the blue shade awning, too hot at 90 degrees...wah.  Will have to try again."}
{"text":"So I finally got in this place. It was hard to find parking but trust me it's worth it. I waited 45 minutes to get a table. Once again worth the wait. Finally got seated. This place would have gotten five stars but unfortunately I got a server on her bad night I guess. Sharay was her name. I was there to eat and drink. I was open for anything. I asked what she recommended for a drink and she replied anything. Now I would have offered the most expensive drink they had. I was open for it. So I just ordered kool-aid. Which was the bomb. I once again asked what she suggested as far as the food goes. Once again anything was her reply. I don't even remember what I ordered but it was big portions. I eat a lot so I knew it was gonna take some effort. As soon as my food arrived not even five minutes later she was asking if I needed a check and a box. In my mind I was thinking I just got started. Now I was stuffed. I ate everything. Still had room for desert. But she didn't even offer so I was like well I better find another place to get some dessert. Even though I got crappy service I still tipped her 20% because I understand it's tough work. I look forward to going back and requesting Sharay again because everybody deserves a second chance."}
{"text":"Had lunch at the Gilbert Lo-Lo's on Saturday as we have just moved here to Arizona and heard some good things about this chain.  Unfortunately the food did not measure up to the hype.  My wife and I are both from New Orleans and love good southern dishes.  The chicken was very dry and basically tasteless - very little to no seasoning.  The waffle was \"blonde\" and very limp - even before adding syrup.  Not what we expected at all.  The service and cleanliness were also very ordinary - I guess typical of many chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Only go to the one on Central. I went to the Scottsdale location and it did not live up to the downtown location. It can get very busy and if you go as a party, everyone has to be present to be seated. Which is fair, considering just how full it can get. The chicken was perfectly crispy while staying juicy on the inside. The waffles seemed to have a cinnamon flavor (I don't like cinnamon so it stood out for me), but if that's your thing then they're really good, for me not so much. The ambience is loud, I went around 5:30pm on a Friday, but not obnoxious. The menu has smile worthy titles for their array of dishes. Try it out!"}
{"text":"I wish I coule say I had the pleasure of trying  Lolos for the first time. Unfortuanetly, our service was non-existent in the extreme. After being seated by the hostess, our waitress brought our party water, took our order, and gave us a single refill. 

In the following hour, not once did our original waitress stop and consult us about the status of our order. Multiple times she strided by and paid our table no attention. After waiting for over an hour and watching various parties, who were seated after our own group, receive their orders, our party walked out. Not a single employ asked why we were walking out.

I've had bad restaurant experiences from servers, hosts, and other employees before. The expectation, even at the worst of establishments, would see that your food would be served to you. Lolos in Scottsdale could not even meet the lowest bar of expectation"}
{"text":"Ate there today for the first time. Best fried chicken and waffles I've ever had. Going to take my wife there soon."}
{"text":"It was going to be my first visit ever to a Lo-Lo's and I had heard great things. When we arrived all the parking spots said \"Hotel Parking Only.\"  The only spaces open for restaurant guests had white cones, so I got out to move a white cone for parking. A restaurant employee said \"those are for valet only,\" but did not instruct us as to where we could park. After 10 minutes of driving around , we left and went to Denny 's. Parking was easier and service was kinder. Don't go here, there is no where to park and rude valet staff."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place...southern flair, cheery and friendly staff, your food is served to perfection, they even have mason jars of kool-aid! I visit here at least once a month! And the red velvet cake will make you wanna scream, its absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Downhill.

Two years ago I went to old location, took my Mom there for mother's day.  It was a good place, quiet, easy parking, good food.  Non-chain, family run.

OK two years later we go again.  Valet parking (? the lot is mostly empty, why can't I park), OK just part across the street and walk.   The problem is they've changed the atmosphere to the trendy, way-loud fashion.   

The interior is all hard surfaces so the conversation is pretty loud, then for some reason they play music.  People talk louder to be heard over music, so they turn up the music, which makes people talk louder.   There is iPhone app to measure sound level- it was consistent 90db.   

To the owners: if we want trendy hip loud restaurant we can go to five-guys.   I won't patronize this place again, you've ruined your atmosphere.    I might try a different location if it not as loud."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the new restaurant space!!!! It's bigger and better! The added bar space was also a nice touch. The food is still amazing, the outdoor space is appealing AND the red velvet cake and pancakes are to die for! This is hands down one of AZ's best dining spots!!! I'm a loyal for life!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst chicken ever. Everything is kid size with inflated prices. Customer service was ok."}
{"text":"Good food. Love the catfish!  The staff is friendly, though the service is VERY slow. The manager and staff were apologetic, but I did have to suggest that they offer biscuits or cornbread to hold us over while we were waiting for the food. Can't say enough how friendly the staff was to us and without question brought out the cornbread while we waited. Other than the food taking a LONG time, good experience overall."}
{"text":"Wow coming from Cali I heard great things - fried.chicken was barely any different tasting the the hungry jacks microwave dinner ... stay away from the tenders all breading and no seasoning -
I guess your spoiled a little when uve has roscoes how is this place even popular ?.. on a good note the waffles and Mac and cheese was great"}
{"text":"I'm visiting family in AZ. They recently moved here so we are all new to the area. Tried this place out and so far all I can comment on is the service. Let's just hope the food is nothing like the service. Very slow."}
{"text":"No!  Just no!

39 minute wait for some $16 beyond edible salty chicken and soggy, thin, undercooked waffle and cold, not cheesy at all Mac n cheese?!  

No!  Just no!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with family which included kids and a toddler. The place is very kid-friendly with a kids' menu and playing loud music. The chicken is tender and juicy and the mac and cheese was on point. Would definitely come again. It's usually busy though so be prepared for a possible wait. Everyone left happy and full."}
{"text":"The food in here is delicious  nothing  else can compare to it .the thing that puts Lo Lo over the top is the staff they make you feel welcome, made me feel like I was at home . You know that feeling when you go to your mom's house and she makes you that home cooking and keeps serving  you even doe your not done with you plate. Well that's  how I felt at 
lolo's  . Aboustly  will drive back from LA to eat here again."}
{"text":"Mmmm mmmm!! That is some delicious, succulent chicken!

I went to Lo-Lo's on a Monday night and it was packed; we were seated immediately in  a little room in the back called the chicken coop. Adorable!
I had grape Kool Aid in a mason jar (giant jars) and probably much too sweet for me though. I also had the Lil Amadi (that may be misspelled) which was 2 pieces of wonderful chicken and a fluffy waffle. SO good.
The chicken was no greasy at all. We also had potatoes, biscuits and cole slaw that we shared at our table.

Service was slow, but completely understandable with every single table full.
Great meal, servers were friendly and the prices were reasonable.

The restaurant has a parking lot which was full but we found parking right on the side street next to the building."}
{"text":"First attempt to eat at LoLo's (on a Sat afternoon) was a fail.  Groups of peops were waiting outside, and because I don't like standing around looking hopeful we left and made another date -

- this time during the week.  There was no line, but the place was still full!  We asked for a booth and within 5-7 mins one was cleaned off then we were seated.  I immediately liked the high ceiling and covered patio with some cushioned seating.  They really want you to settle in while enjoying your meal.

I also noticed there were many employees.  At one time we counted six on the floor.  I don't know how many more were in the kitchen. They all seemed quite friendly and I didn't see any bad attitudes in the young staff (a sign of good training and employee ethics).  

The food was not incredible.  I might have a different review if I liked chicken and waffles, but I don't so I opted for the salmon croquette.  On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being fabulous, I'll give the salmon croquette a 3.  Sorry, but all I tasted was egg.  There was hardly any salmon and I won't be ordering that again.  Ever.
  
For veggies, the greens were delicious.  We ordered seconds.  They were not overcooked and had no meat flavoring. A+ The sweet potatoes were wonderful too.

I wasn't a fan of the cornbread muffin, it was too much flour and not enough corn.  For some folks though, that's how they like their cornbread.  If you're watching your cholesterol, though, better tell them to hold the butter or else you'll end up with a whopping scoop of the yellow stuff right on top.

Despite having said all this, I'm glad to hear of LoLo's expansion.  It could easily be like any other food chain that americans eat at everyday.  Go 'head wit'cha bad self, LoLo's, get your american dream!"}
{"text":"This place exceeds the hype in my opinion. Great chicken and the best waffle I've ever had. 

I'm going again tomorrow."}
{"text":"This is one of the reasons why I visit Phoenix! I have at least stop by here to eat once at every visit. That's how amazing this place is! The environment here really reminds me of people from the south east coast and so do the people. They have that attitude and personality which is really interesting and cool for me to see since I've mostly all my life with on the west coast. So to see a change of personality of someone who is from the other side of the country is a thrill. To start off your drinks are brought to you in a jar which really keeps to the south eastern style and I ordered myself some good ol koolaid which I haven't drank since I was a kid! Then I ordered a 2 piece chicken piece fried Louisiana style with waffles and a side of fried catfish. They taste BOMB! The chicken is still juicy and not all dried out along with a little kick of spice and mixing that with the waffle and syrup is just a great combo. I know to some western people that sounds weird and funny but until you try it, you can't really judge lol. The fried catfish was also amazing. It really hit the spot and during the whole time I can't even socialize with my friends since I'm too busy digging into this delicious meal!!"}
{"text":"All the hype about this place... DEFINITELY WORTH IT!

I came to Phoenix to visit my bestfriend and she had been talking about this place ever since she moved there. 

I walked in the restaurant and was instantly greeted by the friendly hostess. We were sat within 3 minutes (which was pretty good because I've been told that it gets BUSY especially on the weekends)

Our waitress took good care of us. I got the 3 piece chicken with waffles as well as grits and  scrambled eggs with onions and cheese. The fried chicken tasted soo good! You know how sometimes when you deep fry a chicken, sometimes the white meat inside get's excessively oily and greasy--the chicken here was perfectly crispy on the outside and wonderfully moist in the inside. The eggs were AMAZING. 

They serve their drinks in large glass jars--I got the lemonade... yum!

I tried a bit of my friend's catfish sandwich, YUM! Next time I visit, I'm going to have to get that!

Definitely go to Lolo's! There's also one in Scottsdale too if you're in that area ;)"}
{"text":"All of my reviews since relocating to Phoenix mention the fact that I am from Chicago. Well, I have to mention it again. Lo-Lo's is a soul food restaurant with true soul!! I thought I would have to wait until I went back to Chicago before I could get a meal like this. From the moment we stepped foot in Lo-Lo's it felt like home. The staff was friendly and nice, even our fellow diners were friendly.

The chicken and fried catfish was perfect. The waffles were so good, they put cinnamon in the batter. As much as I enjoyed the food I cannot come here too often. Fried food, smothered in gravy makes it into the rotation every few weeks. I'm looking forward to trying the red velvet cake next time.

The music in the restaurant is better than what they play on the radio, a good mix of dusties with some new stuff. I anxiously await our next visit to Lo-Lo's."}
{"text":"I been here 2x and I have to say it's one of my favorites places. The food is always delicious. It's always super busy but the wait is well worth it. The servers are always nice which make up for the wait time. Only down part from my last visit they where out of strawberry lemon. Of course, that was no such a big issue. I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"First time here visiting family & this was a choice on my list to visit. Caught an early dinner, which beat the crowd. I ordered the catfish platter with fries & collard greens and my wife had the chicken and waffles. Fish was over battered, so for me, it was just OK, fries and cornbread were not fresh so it took away from the overall plate, The greens however, was the best on the plate. Full of flavor with a little kick. Also the Kool-Aid in the mason jar was on point....I had red-lol! Staff was helpful and pleasant and the food came out fairly quickly. It was good enough to try again when I return someday."}
{"text":"rib-stickin! what a meal. first time at the PHX location and it is my favorite Lo-Lo's in the valley. 

the Lo-Lo's three piece + two pancake is the move. i dont even like waffles (Sorry Donkey aka Eddy Murphy's character in Shrek) but i wish i had their recipe. i would waffle it up every morning. i would knit a sweater of waffles and wear them in the Phoenician sun. I would quilt these waffles together and sleep beneath it after having stacked a bunch of these waffles on top of each other in the form of a mattress. then i would wake up in the morning and eat those waffles. rinse, repeat.

great hot sauce too by the law. also, can't go wrong with the fried green tomatoes."}
{"text":"service is generally not very good here. long waits for simple things. been here during peak times and off times. doesn't change

that being said, the food basically makes the inadequate service worth it

I always just go straight for the chicken and waffles. looks like there are a lot of other great things but shit that waffle is so good. i always thought i hated waffles. probably bc my mother. idk why my mother always failed at making bomb waffles. these waffles are no joke tho yo

and then you couple that with the zingy zangy breading of the chicken and some hot sauce to boot... DAYUM! 

what a combo

like i said earlier, i basically always go straight for the chick and waff and haven't deviated from that plan all too often

however, fried green tomatoes, bruh, fried green tomatoes...

worth the mediocre service

also, totally forgot to mention- KOOL AID. swish. game over"}
{"text":"Probably closer to 3.5 stars but I rounded up to 4 stars since chicken and waffles is not a food type that I expected to find in the desert. The food is tasty enough and I would expect that LoLo's is the finest chicken and waffles joint in Arizona.

I spend a lot of time in Atlanta on business where chicken and waffles is considered an art form so I'm spoiled by Gladys Knight!

Seriously, the waffles are delicious!  Some of the best that I've had anywhere...  I'm not sure what is going on with the frozen butter/crisco on the waffles but I could do without it.

The chicken is pretty good but it is fairly greasy....  I had the chicken fried chicken and it was a solid offering topped with sausage gravy.

I wanted to try the banana pudding but I succumbed to the chicken, waffles, chicken fried chicken, corn bread, rice/beans,etc...  You won't leave here hungry!"}
{"text":"New address is 2765 N Scottsdale Rd. Same spectacular food, same great price, the new location is outstanding!  Decorated beautifully for inside seating, a bar with both inside AND outside chairs.... And some awesome outside patio seating which includes a fireplace. Tasty waffles.... Juicy chicken... Great service!!!! Love this place :)"}
{"text":"I like the food; however, it has become a parking lot turf war between the motel next door and Lolo's.  The result, Motel Parking sings EVERYWHERE and painted on most of the spots in Lolo's parking lot. I fear no matter wherever I park I might be towed.  Lolo's has responded by blocking off the few spots that they do own with VALET parking.  The result, you end up paying as much to park as you do for one of their breakfasts.  Sad day. I opted to leave and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is average at best, nothing more.  It's not bad, but it's not the GOAT of fried chicken.  If you are from the south, you will be sorely disappointed, I promise you . I just can't take a place serious that uses \"canned greens, \"disgusting. I drove over 40 miles because of the hype, and it was a complete letdown. Can I say it again, canned greens. GTFOHWTBS.
This place is overrated , with bad attitudes and poor ambiance . We weren't even allowed inside , we had to wait outside for 30 minutes.  There is no way in the ham sandwich that I would ever come back to this place, especially considered the many chicken places. This is not a soul food restaurant  and it's only pretenders. You can't fool me , I'm from deep Mississippi. The others just don't know any better .   I would rather eat cat poop with a knitting needle rather to eat that crap again. Ok , so that's a over exaggeration, but you get the point ."}
{"text":"Great location and service. Ordered the fried chicken with waffles, chicken breast was moist and tasty, the waffles was good too. Had the Mac & cheese as a side and those were awesome. For drinks I tried the vodka with Kool aid, very strong but good. If you are craving fried chicken this is the place to go."}
{"text":"As a NC girl, I know my soul food...and this visit, sorry to say, was a big disappointment. Leading off with the positive: no better sweet tea anywhere in AZ & the fried chicken is a stand alone success with no sides needed. I tried the mac-n-cheese (served lukewarm and gummy, not freshly made). Hold times for these items short bc pasta sitting too long changes texture and sauce dries up and that's how my mac-n-cheese was, a wanna be. At $4 for small side dish, I had to send it back and tried the potato salad instead, which was fresh & tasty. The waffle also had to be sent back (served raw, wet--not cooked thru at all & no crunchy exterior. It was gummy, doughy & soft, batter too heavy, thick to cook thru properly). This may be due to kitchen staff not up to task or cost saving measure to cut wasted food, either way is an equally bad move. My server, Sir, was attentive, accommodating and made my meal a pleasure, what remained edible that is. One other notable issue: 5 staff stood gathered around hostess stand chatting and were totally oblivious to my repeated calls for assistance bc my server was busy with other tables--3xs I said \"excuse me ladies\" without one hearing me. Being that my booth was right next to the hostess stand, I found that unacceptable. It was about 3pm, so not super busy yet and they were enjoying a little down time, I get it, but not at customer's expense. Not one of the 5 staff heard me and I  called out to them 3 different times. Clean restaurant, great service but food not up to par with previous visits. If you don't know about it, you can't do better, so this is that. Sorry, will do another review in a few weeks and see what has changed or not. Shared all concerns with Miles, manager on duty, prior to this review posting. Grace to you & staff for another shot at a stellar review."}
{"text":"Tried messaging the restaurant directly with NO response: 
I don't want to put it directly on yelp for all to see because I love this place and seen where I can message the business. I just left and just a tip: the staff may want to pay more attention to its patrons. I had a long wait for something as simple as water, then the waitress was MIA when I needed a refill. Then when we were done we sat there waiting for her to come back around to get our tab. Waited even longer for her to come back to allow us to pay- thank goodness we were paying with cash. We just left it on the table. My guy and I were joking that this would be a perfect dine and dash spot because the staff is too busy socializing with one another to realize if someone slips out."}
{"text":"We love this place. Been here more times than I remember to check in. Staff is always friendly and I haven't yet had a bite of food to complain about. Friday and Saturday nights there's a DJ. Even brought the kids here and they always love it."}
{"text":"Aside from the look I get when walking in for being a white family in an establishment that serves some amazing food this place is incredible! The staff is friendly and I love the giant jars of koolaid! The chicken is the bomb! And the waffles are incredible!"}
{"text":"If you are ever in Arizona stop by this restaurant you will not be disappointed.

They have excellent food from greens, fried okra, fried chicken and red beans and rice to banana pudding.  The servers were excellent they are continually at your service.  The owner and manager also walks around to service your needs and to greet you personally.

We decided to go to the Phoenix location because we wanted to make sure that we were getting the authentic flavor of Soul Food and we loved it.  The drive was worth it from Scottsdale.  

Remember is you are ever in Arizona particularly Phoenix or Scottsdale stop by Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles.  We will be visiting them again within the next few months."}
{"text":"Good food but won't come back for the service. The length of time we had to wait from ordering to receiving our food, I probably could have made my own chicken and waffles. Staff are constantly gathering among themselves that they'd disregard customers. All in all, left with stomach aches waiting so long to eat."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch.. located at a weird intersection.. but still easy to get to and plenty of parking.

Service was super fast and friendly .. drinks came quickly. 

I had the blackened fish dinner (choice between catfish & cod) .. i went with the catfish .. served with shrimp in butter sauce, dirty rice and zucchini medley .. I skipped the rice and got a double order of veggies .. this is a great entree if you're on a low carb diet but not if you're on a low fat diet .. it's a lot of food!! It was really delicious! 

I'll be back for sure!! Hopefully for a cheat meal so I can have some of those waffles or desserts (red velvet pancakes or cake ... can't go wrong at this spot!!)"}
{"text":"I went to the new LoLo's location with other fellow yelpers to check this place out.  I had been to the location downtown and wasnt all that impressed with what I had seen, so I thought I would give it another chance.  This one was a much better time.

Upon entering, said parties were already seated.  I was happy to say that my experience here was much better then before.  This place is actually clean!  and has decent parking!  and, as a bonus, the service was substaintially better then the one downtown.  Same menu, same tasting food, but a better experience.

When coming here, expect to wait.  This place is super popular, and tasty.  Be prepared to eat!!"}
{"text":"*yay!* this is my 200th review!!!!

Ok, so I wanted to do something special for my 200th review, so I took myself to LoLo's chicken and waffles for lunch today.  I had really high expectations, but left kind of feeling a little let down.  

I got there, and sitting outside the front door was some girl who I guess was the hostess.  She asked me how many and I told her it was just me. I felt kind of awkward.  She showed me inside and asked if I wanted to sit at this crammed little bar facing basically a freaking wall.  I asked to be seated somewhere else, as it was really uncomfortable to sit there.  

So, she sat me in another room near the kitchen area.  Did this place used to be a house or something?  It had to have been.  It feels like theres a zillon different little rooms with tables.  

Anyways, so I finally got sat at a real table.  Mazel Tov.   A girl took my drink order, but the service was slow to order. I waited and waited and finally a server came and took my order. I went for the 2 chicken legs and a waffle.  Service actually kinda sucked, but I'm willing to let it go.  I won't hold it against them since everyone seems to like it so much.

So, they bring out my food.  I guess it was okay, but not the greatest food Ive sunk my teeth into. I surprisingly was full when I finished.  the chicken was good, but I think the waffles is what got me.  It came with a nice amount of butter, which I smeared all over the waffle, and then drowned it in syrup. I liked it!  Thier butter really made a difference.

While I was eating, I was happy to see 2 autographs of the Harlem Globetrotters players on the wall, both of which I obviously know.  Impressive!

Needless to say, I guess I was expecting more.  Service was spotty, unimpressive, and actually kind of sucked.  Food was decent, but not earth shattering.  I will probably return, but probably not for some time."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Lolo's! The chicken and waffles is to die for! The staff is very friendly. Although it's normally pretty busy wait times are usually not that long. I make sure I come here each time I visit phoenix!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed some great chicken and waffles here! While both were fabulous, the waffles really stood out for all three of us and are specifically what I would return for. We also tried some of the sides and they were all good - cornbread, mac and cheese and red beans. Everything was quite tasty.

The reason I give this place 4 instead of 5 stars, cleanliness. The floor was filthy, the bathroom needed cleaning and I got dirty silverware."}
{"text":"This place sucks! 
Horrible management!
Horrible customer service!
Came here for breakfast and ordered a Diet Pepsi with my breakfast.
Shortly after ordering our server came back and said they were out of Diet Pepsi.
Which sucks because I wanted one with my meal.
I decided to go next door a grab a Diet Pepsi at Subway while we waited for our food to come out.
Problem solved.... I thought!

I returned with my drink and our food was still not out. About 2 minutes later a 'manager type' comes running over with a total bitchy attitude and gets all over me telling me \"no outside drinks allowed\". I try to tell her I only got this because your restaurant is OUT of Diet Pepsi. 
She didn't care and said I couldn't have it. She wouldn't even talk to me like a normal person. She was very rude and very worked up over a Diet Pepsi.

These people have real horrible attitudes and seem to have a chip on their shoulder! She was horrible from the word go. 
She could have been nice about it but there was nothing nice about her! 
No trying to listen or help the customer.

We decided to get up and leave.

Do you know how many good restaurant choices there are in this area?!
Way way too many to deal with this place and horrible manager who thinks she is working at some fine dining establishment!...............
Nope... you are in a strip mall selling fried chicken!

I got to AZ often....... but I will not go back to this place ever!"}
{"text":"They need some more help in the kitchen or something but this is the third day on a row u can't order to go. Organization people my friends always ask about ordering to go there but they just don't do it how much money are u losing."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was ok and we came in during a slow time. Go here if you have a sweet tooth but they have a variety of other options besides chicken and waffles !"}
{"text":"Should you encounter an hour wait, consider Lolo's worth it.  I've lost count as to how many times I've been here but the food and server make it worth it every time."}
{"text":"Tried Lo-Lo's and loved it! I'm from LA and every time I come to AZ I have to stop by Lo-Los! The servers are very friendly and the food is very good! Prices are not bad!"}
{"text":"I've been here before and had a somewhat better experience. This time not so much. As we watch everyone around us get there food, we waited for quite sometime before finally getting our food, only to find the chicken pieces are way to small. We repeatedly asked for drinks and the waiter only visited out table way too few times. I'm sorry I won't be coming back for a very long time."}
{"text":"i really wanted to love this place but i gotta say it wasnt as great as some people pump it up to be .....dont get me wrong the food was good but not mind blowing"}
{"text":"I will definitely be back. The service was fantastic.  The food was absolutely spectacular. The price was spot on!"}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix for the day and found this place on yelp. I left here wishing I lived in Phoenix. It is fried chicken done perfectly with perfect waffles and perfect butter. There's really nothing else to add. Just go."}
{"text":"The food and uniqueness were absolutely entertaining. Our waiter was very informative very knowledgeable 100% on his A game. All of his food suggestions were on point. His advice was extra helpful because everything on the menu sound delicious. I tell people back in California where I live if you get a chance to go to Phoenix don't forget about the spot called Lolo's"}
{"text":"Ohhoho man, I love America.

I gathered two of my other, uh, \"rubenesque\" ladies to try this place for the first time. I wanted almost everything on the menu, so the best option was obviously the Lolo's Famous SoulFood Platter. There are a few ways to get it, but I did mine with the chicken fried chicken smothered in sausage gravy white sausage gravy (loaded with \"flavor\" they say), mac & cheese, string beans and potatoes.

Sure, I probably had more than my share of fat and salt for the week, but I enjoyed it! The chicken was the star, juicy and crispy, and there was so much sausage in the gravy, even I was stunned. The mac & cheese was good as well, so cheesy that I couldn't manage more than a couple bites (gotta save room for the chicken!). The green beans and potatoes were there to make me feel like I ordered a vegetable, but weren't very good, and the cornbread was dry.

I tried a bite of my friend's waffle, and even though I've never cared for waffles, I enjoyed it.

Despite what many reviewers noted as a lack of or just bad service, we were all happy with our waiter and didn't have to wait overly long for our food."}
{"text":"make sure you enjoy your waffles and chicken onsite. it doesn't taste nearly as good heated up at home.

weekends are busy so try to go during non-peak times in the evening.

tourists: servers are sassy and the waffles are one of the top ten you'll ever taste!"}
{"text":"Sweet tea was delicious.  Fried Chicken was OK.

The waffles here are so LEGIT!... barely had to use any syrup as the waffles were so tasty with just the butter and the waffle itself.  The waffles were just milky goodness and it was a sad times when I finished them off.  I kept thinking about the waffles for the rest of my entire trip to PHX. 

4/5 :)"}
{"text":"This place is heavenly. I had never heard of Lo Lo', but everyone has heard the term Chicken and Waffles. I could only hope the food was as good as Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in Los Angeles.  I must say it surpassed our dreams. I wanted everything we dreamed of.  I think they have several locations, we went to first one found on Central - found on yelp.  Thanks yelp. Love this app.  Anyhoo if you are every in Phoenix plz go see the Lo Lo family. You will fall in love!"}
{"text":"Who woulda thunkkkk Scottsdale, AZ would have such amazing soul food??! They surprised the hell outta me!

Coming from someone who regulars Roscoes chicken &waffles... believe me when I say LOLO's is BOMB!!! 

I got the 3chicken combo... w greens, mac&cheese &cornbread.
 
Cornbread.. hands down Roscoes!
Greens... Roscoes
Mac&cheese... LOLOs for suuuree!
Chicken... tied.. they're both really good!

the staff is super friendly!! can't wait to go back when i visit AZ. (="}
{"text":"Lo Lo s is always a great place for some great comfort food. The way the fried chicken is seasoned makes is so that you can enjoy the basics without having to dress it all up or mask it with ketchup or Tabasco hot sauce. Not to say it's still not a good idea because I go back and forth from hot sauce and none but definitely a great choice. And now that they have it at the ball games it totally changes the game :)"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times.  Parking can be a pain but I'll deal with it because I love it anyways.  I always get the chicken breast with the waffle and grits.  Always a great meal and great service"}
{"text":"OK, I will try to be nice here. But I will warn you, the two worst things that can happen to a customer in a restaurant happened to our party. :-( Sorry Lolo's but you fell a bit short. 

I was looking forward to the Lolo's Chicken and Waffles experience for quite some time now, and the 'rents invited the starving college student, Me, to breakfast. The wait was a bit out of control, however I had an open mind, apparently this place is kind of a big deal and I should be patient. So I was. When we finally got a table, perfectly set aside from everyone else so it would be easy to wrangle the toddler that was with us, good job Lolo's on this one!, we immediately ordered drinks, that all but two out of eight were wrong. No big deal though, it was fixed pretty fast, as there are a million employees there. I am pretty sure we never saw the same person more than once. One to take our drink order, a different to deliver our drinks, a different person to take our food order, you get the picture. 

Anyway, we are having a great time socializing then the food starts to take a little bit of time, but they are busy so we don't bitch about it. When the food finally came, that is when all hell essentially broke loose. The sever first dumped an entire cup of syrup down my dad back, on the chair and all over the floor. Dad was not happy needless to say, but didn't freak out. The poor kid apologized but no other employee, i.e. Manager, came by to help or apologize. THEN, right after the spillage, he handed me my food, which was totally wrong first of all, and there was a gigantic moth sitting a top my mac and cheese. That was par for the coarse folks. I mean look at the plate before leaving the kitchen people, hello! 

I am sure I will go back at some point in my life. However, with all that happened, and the lack of anyone in the joint giving two sh***s about our happiness, I wont be going out of my way."}
{"text":"I went to Lolo's a while ago and I was immediately hooked! This place is more addicting then a good game of Scrabble on a Friday night! Lolo's is my favorite spot in all of Arizona! I hit Lolo's at least once a week with my pals. I always order the Lil Amadi (two thighs please!) with a side of cornbread. I've tried every single Kool Aid they have. Currently, I rotate between the red (fruit punch) and purple (Grape). Sometimes I water it down, because it can get super sugary! Beware sugar junkies! The chicken is sooo yummy and the first bite will have you hooked. Don't forget to try the hot sauce when youre there!"}
{"text":"I Love Lolo's Chicken and Waffles and you will too! 

Recently my fiancé and I went to Lolo's. I had heard about Lolo's and Mrs. White's for years, but never took the time to go to the Phoenix locations. When this south Scottsdale location opened, I made it a point to go and try the food. 

The food is excellent or in my best Brooklyn accent \"Forget about it\". But don't forget about it, the MAC-N-CHEESE is a most try. The chicken is FANTABULOUS, the COLLARD GREENS are on point and they serve Kool Aid. Yes I said Kool Aid. I must have had a gallon of GRAPE KOOL AID. Before this, the last time I had Kool Aid was 1968. 

This place is very popular, so you may have to wait for a table, but it is well worth it. This place is so popular that Sports, Music, Acting and Reality celebrities can be seen here regularly. When we were there we saw the rapper Biz Markie. He did the song \"Just a Friend\" back in 1990.  

The only down side - although the service was generally good, it gets so busy that at times the server may get distracted and may not come back to you as timely or often as you may like. 

BOTTOM LINE, I LEFT FULL, HAPPY AND WITH A KOOL AID SMILE. TRY IT YOU WILL LIKE IT"}
{"text":"Got seated in short order.  Took a good 10 minutes for our server to come by the table.    Took 40 minutes to get our food but buy far the food is made with love.
Collards Green, outstanding, nice rounded flavors with a little heat.
Mac & Cheese, very good, creamy and cheesy.  Would have loved a little crust, my fav
Chicken, check, crispy, nicely seasoned.  If a food dictionary had a picture of Fried Chicken, it would be this
Waffle, great flavor, like the touch of cinnamon.  But mine was not crispy."}
{"text":"CONGRATULATIONS on their new location!  Saw them on tv this morning and had to see the new digs!   3133 N. SCOTTSDALE RD. Having the chicken and waffles. Very good.   Next time I am getting the stuffed French Toast or the Shrimp and Grits.   Always great friendly service!"}
{"text":"First and foremost, I've loved loved going to Lo-Lo's to eat.  We've been to the current location twice now.  Just this past Sunday, 10/19/2014, we arrived in time for the doors to open at 7am.  The music was loud.  Yes, on a Sunday morning at 7am, it was loud enough for us to ask the server or hostess if the music could be turned down and the answer was no.   The food was as delicious as always and the service was pretty good, but we had a hard time hearing him, over the music.   Honestly, if it's that loud at that time of morning, how can we invite friends to go there?  We couldn't have a conversation.   It just doesn't make sense.   I don't want to give it a lower rating because I only have the one complaint... as major as it is, we won't go back til we know we can have a decent conversation."}
{"text":"I have had chicken. I have had waffles. And now, I've had chicken AND waffles. 

Prior to today, I didn't realize the distinction. Prior to today, I never had cause to consider the combination. Prior to today, I didn't realize what I was missing.

Now let's be clear: this isn't the place for dieters. It's not a place for any pretentious behavior. The place has \"Chicken & Waffles\" in the name, OK? And that's what you're going to get. In abundance.

Cheap as hell. I had the #1, also known as KK's. Three huge-ass pieces of chicken -- breas, thigh and mutant leg. All battered and fried to perfection. Two waffles the size of Vermont. A bucket of grits with some egg/cheese/onion concoction on the side. OK, I could have done without the last part. But hey, when in a chicken & waffle place...

I'm still full. I won't eat dinner tonight. I crashed out for an hour in post-prandial bliss. And I'd have typed this review faster if I could have stopped sucking my fingers like a four-year-old.

Damn."}

{"text":"I was so glad that there's a Lo-lo's at the airport. It's located on the third floor before heading to the gates for security check-in. The food is delicious! I ordered a side of fries, and they were not stingy about it - plenty of fries to share with other people. We got the Lo-lo's Special with 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles. The chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I recommend dipping the chicken in the hot sauce that is provided. The waffles also taste so much better when you add on the butter and syrup. I love getting the Kool-Aid; the amount of sweetness is spot on. My favorite is the fruit punch.

I would have given this place 3 stars for great food and convenient location. However, the service was terrible. The server did a subpar job. She couldn't remember our order. When our order was ready, she was stressed out that we were asking for extra hot sauce. There was only 2 other people waiting in line - nothing to be flustered about. She finally gave us our food, but forgot to give us our Kool Aid. We immediately informed her of our missing drink. Instead of correcting her mistake, she made us wait for her to ring up two more customers before giving us our Kool Aid. We were just awkwardly waiting at the pickup counter. Seriously, it does not take long to fill up a drink and give it to the customer. Our food was cold by the time we could get to it. Very disappointed in the decision-making process of this worker. I took away one star for bad service."}
{"text":"Lolo's is the result of vision, and putting your heart and soul into painting that vision on the canvas of reality. From the moment my wife and I walked in, we were immersed in the soul food vibe. From the kind hostess, to the music playing softly enough to hear, but still enjoy a conversation, to the walls covered in murals of family portraits, all the way to the food... Oh my, the food. Southern fried chicken and waffles, grits, collard greens, and sweet tea in a mason jar. As I ate, all I could think was, \"Thank you, Jesus.\" The ONLY thing that was a little disappointing was the catfish, a little too thin and a little too dry. But the rest of the experience made it a single drop of rain on a sunny day. If you're ever in Phoenix and you love soul food, do not wait as long as I did to experience Lolo's."}
{"text":"The only place to go for soul food in Scottsdale.  Chicken and waffles of course, but lots of other stuff too.  I like the \"Backwoods,\" livers and gizzards in a pan gravy over rice.  When you're in the mood for this sort of thing, this is the only place to go."}
{"text":"As a LA native I have had the famous Roscoes chicken & waffles, this is BETTER.  I never thought I would ever say that.  Every time I come here we come in a big group, they are really accommodating and quick with the food.  The servers are really friendly and they have kool-aid on tap, if you're a fan.  The chicken is delicious, perfectly seasoned, perfectly fried, and perfectly juicy! The waffle was not soggy and compliments the chicken well.  The mac and cheese is so good.  Be ready to be so full you can't breathe though! Big portions and super heavy.  Its a must try if you are ever in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Im shocked I haven't reviewed this place yet (Shame on me).

Ok first off....Jar of Drank....yes its on the menu that way, yes its a mason canning jar, yes they put fricken KOOLAID IN IT! HECK YES!

The waffles are amazing I believe they have a bit of cinnamon in them and the friend chicken is goodness in your mouth.

I have also had the lemon-aid (also awesome), and the Mac in cheese is to die for. 

There staff is amazing it really feels like you are down home around your Mom's table. I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the valley to give it a shot. The one thing I have not tried is the Red Velvet Cake. I am dying to try it but I am always amazingly over full when I am done with my meal here.

Great portions, great food, great service...and did I mention Koolaid?"}
{"text":"Well...a splurge is a splurge right? I hadn't been to a chicken and waffles joint since I lived in LA years ago so I knew the kids would be all for BREAKFAST FOR DINNER (aka waffles and chicken). The place is bright and hella noisy music wise but service was friendly and attentive. The fried chicken was absolutely top notch and I love, love, love, rooster hot sauce. The waffles weren't as great as the chicken but my kids still devoured them. The collards were surprisingly bland but fries were good and again the chicken is fabulous!"}
{"text":"I was visiting my family and we went to check out Lo-Lo's because we'd heard good things about the food.  The food was pretty good but the service was LOUSY.  It appeared our order was skipped or somehow forgotten as tables around us that were seated after us received their food.  Our waitress disappeared and we happened to catch someone who we believe was the manager serving another table.  We asked what was going on with our food and said he was going to check but never came back.  Another 15 minutes passed and we finally received our food.  We asked to speak with the manager several times just to talk about our experience but he never came out.  I believe they said he name was Josh or Jim or something like that and he was supposedly in the kitchen helping to get food out.  in the end, he comped our meals but that wasn't what we wanted.  We really wanted some type of explanation of what was going on and you know...a little customer service.  

The only shining light in terms of customer service was another young man who helped to bring out our food, grabbed utensils for us to eat with while our waitress was still MIA, and kept checking back with us.  He even had the courtesy to apologize for the manager not bothering to come out.  He should be running the place because Josh or whatever his name is clearly doesn't know what he's doing."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. A great place to take your family. Everything on the menu is Delis!! I would recommend the sweet tea or the coo laid"}
{"text":"Every time I go in to the one on South Central we have really gotten to know all the wait staff and everyone of them are all so friendly. From Jaqwan to Brittney and Mari to Stephen got to give you all a super big thumbs up. Best customer service in a restaurant. The owners really take good care of his employees it shows in all their attitudes. Sometimes we go in on our Saturdays for men's breakfast to popping in for lunch during the week. The food is so good too I mean who doesn't crave Chicken and Waffles all the time. And if you need to jump start your heart try the Sweet tea I call it crack in a jar, yum... keep up the best customer service guys we love you. 
Really praying for one in the west valley soon."}
{"text":"Now tell me that you don't ever crave some bad delicious food in your life with a spoon full of sugar in your mouth?

No? just me? ok.

First and foremost the parking here is crazy and it takes some patience walking into this place. On the weekends they have free valet but if come during the week its a fight for a spot kinda deal. They now opened up the lot next door that is gated in  front of some shop, along with the side street parking. 
Walking inside the wait can be a little frustrating and can turn a lot of people away that I've noticed. The seating area is small so you will have to stand and endure the life lesson of patience. On the weekends they do have a DJ between the bathrooms, so that's something to look forward, is the great jams!

Once seated the food comes out fairly quick and it is always hot off the stove! I always order Lo Lo chicken breast and drumstick with one waffle, side order of the mac and cheese with a grape kool aid!  

Let me tell you my yelpers it is worth the time, the patience and the angry moments now called \"Hangry\""}
{"text":"Why not?  Chicken Waffles and Honey on top...  What a place to step out of the normal eating patterns and try this Lolo's Chicken & Waffles if you have never had it.  I consider this a breakfast spot. But when I drive by it at night it does make me hungry.  Whats up with the hundreds of reviews I don't know but a lot people have something to say and I think that's attractive.

I can't say I'm not a fan i have brought people here some like it some don't the price is a little high priced but expected, someone has to pay for their new high end location.  

Don't forget to take a trip to the South Side of Phoenix to the original lolo's."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for chicken and waffles.

While this may not be the best I still enjoyed it. I think the waffle was more like an Eggo but the chicken was delicious and crispy. I'm so glad this was our first stop from the airport. 

If we're ever back in town, I would definitely want to eat here again."}
{"text":"I saw them on Instagram a while ago. Coincidentally I came to Phoenix for business and I made sure at the request of a friend of mine, that I go to LoLo's.
I had the Shrimp & grits, along with three thighs and 2 waffles! This was everything! Thank you LoLo's I will be back!"}
{"text":"The best consistent food and service place to stop for chicken and the waffles are the best."}
{"text":"Im  fan of lolos on South Central.  I thought I'd give this new location a shot.  
My food took a long time,  I've seen my food come faster on a busy night,  and I was there on a slow night.  
Second of all,  I got red velvet cake,  to go like I always do.  It was a TINY piece, not to mention,  it tasted like it had been sitting on the counter for two weeks.  Just horrible.  

Not convinced to return to this location."}
{"text":"I had never had chicken and waffles before coming to Lo-Lo's and now it is a staple for my Saturday morning hangover routine also a great place to go when people come to visit.  The food is southern style comfort food and everything I've tried is delicious. The service is just OK and they do get busy on the weekends but totally worth it anyway! Chicken and waffles are my favorite thing on the menu, can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"We love going to the Lolos at the downtown location but had a really bad experience at this one.
We were around the area and was craving fried chicken so we though we'd stop by. This location is completely different from the downtown location. There is no service here. After being seated, we waited a while to get our drink order and after the drink order no one came by to take our order. There was 3-4 staffs behind the counter and 2 staffs on the floor and no one seemed to give a crap. After waiting for  over 10 mins (which is really long when you're starving already) we decided to walk out of the restaurant and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"A hole-in-the-wall recommendation with a Sheri's flavor

When a local tells you the story of Lo-Lo's starting out in a tiny house and growing into 3 fabulous Phoenix restaurants, you get a little excited. But that expansion should have warned us enough to try somewhere else. While the atmosphere and decor was phenomenal and fun, the food was not. I am becoming a chicken and waffles connoisseur as I travel, and these chicken and waffles should have been passed up. The waffles were flat and soggy, the chicken seemed to be microwaved, and not enough syrup was provided. I hardly use syrup so for me to be left wanting more was surprising. I did enjoy the taste of the waffles...maybe a hint of cinnamon which is unusual but great, but neither my husband or myself finished our meals which is a big sign that something was sadly off."}
{"text":"As always a fantastic breakfast.  I always get the 3 piece chicken and waffles with leftovers for later."}
{"text":"Always a hit with my kiddos. GREAT tasting chicken. We like to order the mac and cheese too with our meal. Waffles are good but I remember them being crispy before not so much now but still good. The service is always A+. Usually always a super busy location so the wait can take a while for the food to come out. Not today it was out in less than 10 min or so. That was kind of a shocker. I love their ice tea, it can be a bit sweet for me personally so I always order half sweet half unsweeted and that's perfect for me."}
{"text":"How do you squeeze in eating at three restaurants within a 12-hour time span?  Travel with me and my spouse!  I actually had Mrs. White's Golden Rule Café bookmarked for our last layover meal in Phoenix but because they didn't open early enough, we ended up at Lo Lo's. 

ATMOSPHERE:
Established in 2002 by Larry White, the restaurant is located in a quiet but shady-feeling part of southern Phoenix.  They proudly display their back-of-house operation with big windows along the sidewalk where you can see them making their biscuits.  The space has a fun vibe with soul music pumping throughout.  Brick walls and industrial décor made for a modern feel.  Seating is plentiful with a mix of booths, low tops and protected outdoor tables.

MENU:
It's huge!  Southern-inspired breakfast selections, chicken & waffle combos, catfish, shrimp, grits, burgers, salads, desserts, kids menu.

FOOD:
Lil Amadi - $8.00
This chicken & waffle combo came with a drumstick, a thigh and a waffle!  What a deal!?  The chicken was crispy, juicy and seasoned perfect.  I'm thinking they do a dry batter as there wasn't that nasty undercooked film you sometimes find in wet-battered fried chicken.  The waffle had a nice crunch and was moist inside but there was a hint of cinnamon coming from either the syrup or the waffle itself that I could've done without.  Still, I'd totally order this again.  Very tasty!

One Buttermilk Biscuit - $4.29
It was a hearty portion with great flavor and just the right amount of moistness.  Comes with a dollop of butter and jam to the side.

Cheese Grits - $4.29
Talk about butter and oil overload.  While it was tasty, there was way too much butter that crowned the bowl.  The copious amount of cheese also left a big oil slick at the top.  I understand that southern cuisine isn't healthy but they should be put on the side so one can regulate their cholesterol intake, LOL.

SERVICE:
Amanda was our terrific, on-the-ball server.  She was friendly, professional and checked on us often. 

TIP:
The entire menu is available from breakfast time, which is how they earned our biz!

OVERALL:
The best chicken and waffles I've had yet.  Lively ambiance, nice menu, great service.  A definite return!"}
{"text":"There's nothing like some good southern food on a blistering hot day. The boyfriend and I were craving waffles thanks to Food Network when we decided to have lunch at this well known favorite.  
I've been to both locations and even though they serve the same food, I think I'm partial to the downtown location, simply because it feels like you're really down in the south. It's in a renovated house and you're sitting at small home dinner tables. The Scottsdale location is nice, but not as authentic. 
Today's experience was definitely not the best we've had.  We were greeted when we walked in and immediately sat. But that's about where the good service stopped for the day. While we looked over the menu, I overheard another table ask where their drinks were. Apparently the kitchen was out of ice, but the server failed to communicate this to the table. Lucky for us, we didn't have to worry about the ice situation, as our server decided just to wait to greet our table or take our order until there was ice. 
When our server finally arrived, she did take our order (The Betty Book and fried okra for me) and put in a drink order. After a few minutes, we got our drinks and our food shortly after. Everything came out great, but we were missing the okra. When I asked, the runner said they didn't have it right now. A few minutes later, our server came to apologize. She said she didn't hear the order, which is really no big deal. Then, she informed us that they don't carry it this time of year because it's too humid to fry correctly. While I appreciate their effort to not serve inferior product (which so many places will do anyway) , it seems a little strange that southern states carry fried okra during the summer when they are considerably more humid than Arizona.  It just didn't make much sense to me, as I am from Texas and have eaten perfectly crunchy fried okra during the summer.  
All in all, the food was as good as it always is. Maybe it was just an off day for service."}
{"text":"Great fried chicken and catfish! We drove all the way from So. Cal just to have chicken and fish as good as what we had when we lived in the South. Our waiter Mike was friendly, attentive and fun. Give the man a raise!! He can teach a few things to grumpy  waiters at other restaurants who shall remain unnamed. The only reason I did not give this location a 5 star  is the table at our booth had some sticky honey residue on it and my seat was torn.  I almost forgot about the homemade lemonade!!! Oh my gee! It's fantastic!  That  being said..... we will be back!"}
{"text":"Ditto what everyone else said...

Seriously, no Eggo waffles here, these are really tasty waffles (I think I taste a hint of cinnamon perhaps) it was accented with a generous scoop of butter...yummy-O!

Chicken was thoroughly covered with a nice coating of salty crispiness....so juicy, you need some extra napkins.

1 waffle and 2 pcs of chicken = $7.

Service was SUPER friendly, everyone was friendly, it's just a friendly place overall...group hug!

Located along Scottsdale road in the Albertson's Shopping Center, you can't miss it driving by...HELLO yummy fried chicken, HELLO delightful waffles! {i heart} U!"}
{"text":"Food was good, our server was ok, but over all it was not a relaxing place to go,   the music was way to load to have a conversation with the people at the table let alone talking to our server.   We ask if they could turn down the music, and the request was ignored. Manager never came to our table to we asked our server . Could not get out of there fast enough, and although I like the food it is not enough to want to go again and I doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"AWESOME fried chicken! I could eat multiple plates of it, I wouldn't live for long, but I would definitely enjoying it. The crust of the chicken has excellent flavor and they cook it perfectly, it is also great chicken, and I mean that it doesn't have dark spots. 

The waffles weren't great though and I didn't love the mac and cheese, but they do have good corn bread. 

Overall, it's worth going just for the amazing chicken."}
{"text":"I love LoLo's! This was my first time coming to the Scottsdale location. I love that LoLo's provides consistency with their food no matter what location you go to. This location is very nice and the decor is on point. The staff was very attentive and friendly. If you are in the neighbor give it a try, the chicken tenders are off the hook!"}
{"text":"Food always hits the spot but the service is severely lacking! Had a hair in our butter, they forgot half our order and no one picked up the check after 15 minutes of waiting. Wish the service was half as good as the food."}
{"text":"This is a must try if you are ever in phx! There are two locations which one is in downtown phoenix and the other in Scottsdale. After a night of partying and some great home cooked meals or just the craving for something sweet yet salty this place will hit the spot. I love that they make their own kool-aid and also have a variety of flavors. The Mac N Cheese is to die for along with their cornbread. I have had everything from the breakfast sandwhich, catfish, chicken wings, chicken strips, breast, and waffles with none of them falling short from excellent."}
{"text":"Chicken was ok a little pricey for the serving and taste. service oh ya its to much of I don't really care about what happens or gets done to much lax as we say. its like anything some like it some don't but its not anything I drive out the way for or make a special trip for.. One thing about busy is you have to run your business busy or not everyone pays the same and should receive good food and good service it goes hand in hand."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere. Quick service and the very best fried chicken! I can't wait for the Lo-lo's in Gilbert to open up!"}
{"text":"My quick summary:  Deliciously surprising.

So my younger sister had been trying to take me for some chicken & waffles for years.  But, me being the stubborn mule that I am, I dug in my heels.  I was stuck on my idea that fried chicken & waffles are not a natural combination, as this was not the food I was raised on and I don't even like waffles.  Boy was I wrong.

My sister had a insane pregnancy craving while we were out together one day & demanded I take her to Lolo's that very moment.  Who am I to argue with a seven-month pregnant woman who is like 6 inches taller than me?  I am proud to say I caved like the cowardly lion.

My first impression on the atmosphere leaned towards the positive side as the place was packed on a weekday, during lunch.  And the colors are bright & exciting.  The desserts were displayed in cases on the counter & looked mouthwatering.

The waiter was funny, friendly & very helpful.  I am not a Kool-Aid drinker, so he brought me his own concoction of rd Kool-Aid mixed with lemonade.  One word: addicting.  

I ordered the Tre Tre, which comes with a couple legs & a waffle, a side of mac & cheese & banana pudding for dessert.  The chicken I ate first, being not that big a fan of waffles.  It was divine.  The spices on the skin are amazing, best I've ever had.  The mac & cheese was creamy and rich.  I even loved the waffle.  It is cooked perfectly, and has a hint of cinnamon.  And I don't usually eat pudding, but I will order that there whenever possible.  There was not a crumb left on my plate.

I now take any family & friends there if we happen to be in the area.  And they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Came here on the impression that it was one of Phoenix better restaurants. While my waffle was good its was not anything that stood out. My drumsticks lacked flavor, but there was crunch. Their award winning hot sauce to me was essentially Tabasco with spice to it. Not overwhelming but also not special enough to keep my satisfied. Kool aid is made well. My girlfriend ordered the biscuits and gravy. They did mess up my gf's eggs. Gave her scrambled instead of over medium, but that's ok they were still good. Her potatoes were salted appropriately to not taste too salty but just enough so that you still taste the potato. Only had a few bites of her biscuits and gravy and they were enjoyable. Overall the chicken is what is going to keep me from coming back, it was too plain, lacked seasoning and to me was essentially just fried."}
{"text":"So I'm from Kentucky and jus let me tell you bein in this place totally made me feel like I was back home. And I loved it!! I had a few things a la carte cuz I wanted I try everything! To drink I got an Arnold Palmer with unsweet tea (don't tell anyone in ky I did that) and one of my friends ordered the kool aid. It tasted just like a watermelon jolly rancher she loved it!! 

Because they cook all the chicken to order it takes a good amount of time to get your food. We were also there on a Sunday after church so there was a pretty long wait. Jus don't expect to be in a hurry is all. One thing I will say was a downfall though was how darn hot it was in there. It was almost uncomfortably hot. They are moving to a new location soon though so hopefully that will fix it!!

To eat I had the fried okra, a thigh, a waffle, and Mac an cheese. I also tried bites of cornbread and red velvet cake. My favorite part was probably the waffle and a close second the okra. Everything was super hot and delicious. I can't wait to go back and try everything I didn't get to try this time!!"}
{"text":"45 bucks for dry chicken, bisquick waffles, and drinks so sweet you pray they don't refill them so the ice can dilute the diabetes. Kinda disappointed, there was so much hype for this place I was excited and totally let down. Staff was polite. Restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"I'm from California so I'm fairly loyal to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. But my craving was great and opted for Lo-Lo's. Get the number 3, two waffles 3 chix and have Bruce be your waiter. Oh and don't miss out on the Kool Aid, it's like drinking straight sugar but diabetes only scares you if you go to the doctor and he tells you you have it"}
{"text":"We were told by a friend to visit Lolo's. We all ordered the chicken & waffles but I ordered a side of fried okra. The chicken was hot but lacked flavor and waffle was cool. I have been to Roscoe's and ordered it at other places this was a total disappointment. The best thing was the fried catfish appetizer. Probably won't visit again as Phoenix is not the place to be."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Excellent southern hospitality! Best sweet tea! Love the collards! And the chicken and waffles is pretty damn good too , j/k, is amazing!!! I get the Chicken Fried Chicken Combo almost every time though (deep fried boneless chicken breast smothered in sausage gravy) just add their house hot sauce and I'm in heaven!!! As a matter of fact, it's lunch time, and that's what I'm gonna get now!"}
{"text":"Hello Lo-Lo!  Oddly off the Main street but that's cool.  

Our server was cute, attentive, and welcoming.  They were playing gospel music in the background.

It's all about the food baby!  It's simple down home fare and they do it well.  If you're looking for something different and you're near the airport.  Try it."}
{"text":"This was the 2nd time we received bad service at Lolo's. This time we tried the new location in Scottsdale.  We waited about 30 minutes to be seated at the high top table, 5 minutes later our server took our order which was quite simple 2 mimosas and 2 toy toys. We waited another 30 minutes for our mimosas; our server complained to the  bartender who look overwhelmed.  The bartender finally brought over our drinks with an apology.  My plate came with no syrup or silverware,  5 to ten minutes later my wife's plate still wasn't brought out. I asked for the manager and another server just pointed him out. Anyway I explained the issue, we left and will not be returning to either location.  I remember before they started valet parking the service was quite good and so was the food. My point is many times when businesses get successful they get beside themselves and forget the little things that got them where they are now."}
{"text":"Much to my dissapoint and surprise I had my first bad experience at LoLos after coming here for the past. 10 years Sat down promptly got my gizzard appetizer quickly and then  the longgggg wait for our 4 soulfood platters eventually came out 1 at a time was told the mgr would stop by but he never waited another 15 min for ketchup I have never said a bad thing about this place ..everrrr till tonite I know the family personally my buddy Jaquan all the mgrs I am the big white who always wanted 4xl lolo shirts. Saddened by the evening"}
{"text":"I won't be coming here again.  The prices are ridiculous and that older man is rude.   23.00 for 3 pieces of chicken and fries, with a side of mac & cheese. Can't forget the kool-aid!   The mac & cheese cost 4.50 and it's in a little cup. It was dried up and maybe from the day before.   Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place every time I come into town to watch the Cardinals.  The manager is responsive and the staff works hard.  I enjoy the food.  My kids love the kool aid and i love the bloody mary's."}
{"text":"For the longest time I put off eating Lo-Lo's because I'm a faithful one to Roscoe's, however sometimes the smell of fried chicken and freshly made waffles are too hard to resist. Just know ahead of time that Lo-Lo's is definitely going to put you to sleep- literally and figuratively!

I had to do it the right way and get the obligatory Chicken & Waffles- \"Tre-tre\" which is two drumsticks and a waffle ... and a sweet tea to drink. Amazingly fried chicken with hot sauce is pure gluttonous heaven, followed with the sweet and crisp waffle. The sweet tea is so, so good it's refreshing and sweet! Also you get it in a large mouth mason jar that is enough for two people!

Service is a bit slow, but reasonable for the amount of people dining in and parking may be a bit problematic. Once you step out of your car the smell of waffles wafting in the air will resolve some of that stress- trust.

I'm going to say what I tell everyone about having chicken & waffles ... it is one glorious meal, then you feel like garbage afterwards- but it's totally worth it! Speaking of which, chicken and waffles sound really good about now.

O:^)"}
{"text":"Best Fried Chicken EVER.

My boyfriend and I stop here every time we are in Phoenix (we travel from LA to Sedona often). We go for Chicken and Waffles most of the time. The collard greens are really good too."}
{"text":"well I am back again and I cant stop not coming to this place! To review, I love the ambiance of this place, the warmth provided by the people here and ofc the food. I got my veggie platter again with the 4 dishes being Fried Okra, Mac & cheese, 2 Eggs/Cheese & Onions and I cant remember what else but I remember feeling amazing bout it :) Oh wait did i eat waffles, ah well I cant remember. I think I should stop eating the sides and eat something else for a change next time, like the salad maybe. ah well to the next time then!"}
{"text":"On my trip to Arizona, I had the fortunate opportunity to join in a UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event), the Breakfast Club. Monica O. has been the host of this wonderful tradition and I was excited to be a part of it! I heard some awesome things about this place so I knew I had to try it out!

When we got in, I was super modern and nice! Exposed air ducts, dark wood and stainless steal accents made for the modern farm look.The place did a great job on the great job on the decor as well. Oversized pictures of chickens and neon lights to pop out. Our server was super efficient and really catered to our needs. We asked him to give us separate checks in the beginning and he did a fantastic job splitting them by the time our meals were done. Speaking of meals, here's what I got: 

-#3 Lo-Lo's for $13. Three piece chicken prepared southern style, with two golden waffles. For the three piece, I got a thigh, drumstick and wing. OH-EM-GEE, I LOVED the chicken! Super crispy skin and juicy on the inside. The chicken was spiced nicely and was packed with flavor. The wafflers were two large patties, stacked and served with butter and syrup. The waffles weren't as fluffy as I was hoping for. I little flat and dense however mixed with butter and syrup, it turned out good. 

Overall, this place definitely rocked! I will definitely make my way back to Lo-Lo's on my next Phoenix/Scottsdale trip. If you're in the area, you need to check them out. Try their chicken and you will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love this place I've only had chicken with my breakfast!! I've had banana Carmel pecan pancakes and red velvet pancakes! Both were good but Banana won no between the two no syrup needed!! Bacon is thick cut and delicious! Yeah I had bacon and chicken! Haven't been for lunch or dinner yet but I'm sure it won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"we drove to Scottsdale cause I heard of this place called Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles on YELP 
When we first drove by there was a line outside the door, this on a Saturday afternoon. By the time we turned the car around everyone had been seated inside. The place was packed but my party of 4 were seated right away at a large table by the window.

It was really funny in there, the waiters had on black t-shirts that said funny things like \"HOOD Rich\" and \"GHETTO FABULOUS\"
and all the menu items were named 'ghetto' names and they even had Red Kool-Aid as a menu item. Since I'm from the \"hood\" in Detroit, I found it all hilarious.

Me and my grandma shared a meal, it was called \"Ke-Ke's\" which consisted of 3 pieces of fried chicken, a bowl of grits, some cheese eggs and 2 waffles. Much too much for one person but perfect for 2. Our meal was soooo delicious, that fried chicken has the perfect batter on it, not too thick, perfect seasoning. the waffles tasted like it had a dash of cinnamon or nutmeg in it and came with warm syrup, the grits came with a ice cream scoop of butter on them, The eggs were the best scrambled eggs n cheese I've ever had, ever, even homemade scrambled eggs weren't this good. 

I mean this food was sooo good. 

My cousin Apryl ordered 2 chicken legs, baked macaroni and cheese and candied yams, my Aunt Vicki ordered fried catfish, grits and collard greens.

The food there is perfect and I really want to go back cause i want to try the beans and rice, the greens, candied yams, actually all their side orders I want to try them.

The waitress was nice, and 2-3 came to our table to deliver the food and check up on us,  and our table was bussed pretty quickly. My only complaint is we had to wait a long time for our check to come and we were ready to go. We had to ask a bus girl to get our check for us. Also we'd asked for the check to be split in 2 and that wasn't done, so we had to wait even longer for them to get that worked out.

I recommend the place for it's food and ambience."}
{"text":"I was craving chicken and waffles aso I decided to try the phoenix location of LoLo's. This location seems bigger and nicer decor. I like the floors. I went around 10:30 am on a weekday. I ordered chicken breast, waffle and cheesy grits. It came out really fast and it was delicious"}
{"text":"I picked up food for my hungry family.  It was our first visit, so we sampled everything, and everything was delicious.   No complaints, only raves.

The service was wonderful, very friendly, helpful and efficient.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent as always. Chicken was seasoned to perfection and waffles were fresh and hot. Worth the wait"}
{"text":"OMG, I'm a Lo Lo's addict after eating here for the first time a couple of weeks ago.   This place is busy and has a wait for good reason.  The chicken and the waffles are to die for.   We only waited about 20 minutes for a table.  Our server was awesome and made sure our lemonades were kept full.   My husband and I both ordered chicken and waffles.  I like that there are different parts of the chicken you can order based on your tastes.  The price is right too.  Also make sure you order a side of Mac n Chz to go with your chicken and waffles.   The meal kept us so full we didn't even feel like eating dinner that night! :)"}
{"text":"Went to Lo-Lo's on a friend's recommendation. Place is fantastic! And it was packed! For good reason too. The waffles are outstanding! Best I have had in a very long time. Chicken was just as delicious. I wish I had gotten the Kool-Aid. My mistake there. The atmosphere is super chill. Everyone we encountered during our visit was pleasant and the service excellent. Our server Lynette was awesome and took care of us quickly and the utmost professionalism. Excellent all the way around. I was born and raised in LA. There is a famous place out there we used to hit before going to Kings, Lakers, Dodger games. Now that I am in Arizona, I will definitely be making Lo-Lo's my stop before I hit Suns & D-Backs games. Fantastic place! Glad we found it!"}
{"text":"I've been to Lo-Lo's (and catered another office luncheon) several times since my first review for them and it's always the same thing when I do patronize them; amazing, flavorful food cooked with love and served by gracious, friendly servers.  

The last time I went to their Phoenix location they had a special on an appetizer of fried green tomatoes and my husband and I tried them and were so impressed with them, delicious!  I definitely suggest you order them if they are offering them when you go!"}
{"text":"Such a great place for comfort food. The fried chicken is an excellent southern rendition and vibe is good. I always order the Lo Lo's, which is 3 pieces of chicken prepared southern style, with 2 golden waffles... and it's plenty for me. The 'dranks' come in big mason jars are usually don't need to be refilled. It's a team service event and it's always on-point. Mama has done good!  Certainly going back."}
{"text":"Oh, my goodness, gracious--MOUTHWATERING. 

This location is always pretty busy because it is so dang good. Staff is friendly and attentive. 

I got the Betty Boop which is two homemade waffles (with a hint of cinnamon sweetness) and a crispy fried chicken breast. It was absolutely delicious. I could not leave without trying their mac and cheese. Man, am I glad I got to taste all of the cheesiness goodness baked into their mac and cheese--home cooking at its best. 

I can't wait to come back, again and again."}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's is the ultimate chicken and waffle spot..not only is the food good but the atmosphere is always upbeat..as you watch TV and listen to some music that will make you want to eat"}
{"text":"Two locations that makes this doubly good.  Word of advice though, Sundays and Fridays are busy, so be prepared for a little wait.  Wife and I go after work around 4-430 when feasible, before the rush, and we are able to get in, seated, and out.  The chicken is superb, the waffles are golden brown, the catfish is stuperbly bursting with flavors, if you never thought of chicken and waffles, try LoLo's they will change your mind."}
{"text":"Like always had a great experience here.  Although the parking can be tight at times, the food makes up for loss time.  Our server Andrea was excellent and her timing was impeccable when it came to refreshing our drinks, clearing off plates, and everything else.  Thanks again Lo-Lo's for another great experience"}
{"text":"OM Heavenly G!!!  Who knew fried chicken and waffles went so well together!!!  My daughter was in heaven!!  She loved her chicken and she doesn't eat much meat at all but the crispy fried chicken had her knawing on the bone.  I ate my entire plate and so did my daughter.  And she has been asking to go back ever since.  And the sweet tea....YUM!!  It was just right, not overly sweet.  I don't know that a place like this exists anywhere in the Northern CA/Bay Area but someone should open one!  For now this is one reason I'm glad I live in Phoenix.....I will be a frequent customer.  

The inside feels like you walked into someone's house and I never would have known it was there since it's in a non descript part of town...kind of industrial.  We got there pretty early and by the time we left, the place was packed!  

I have been craving this chicken since we went there...I know we will be back!!!  And often!"}
{"text":"The best from start to finish! We enjoyed breakfast here this week. The staff could not have been more hospitable and friendly. One of the staff members even remembered us later that night at Chase Field as he worked the new Lo Lo's concession and we were passing by. He made us feel like we were at home. What greater compliment can a restaurant staff receive making folks that comfortable.  

The restaurant was very cool and super clean.  The food rocked! See the pictures attached to this email. A must try when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Tips:

The Kool-Aid is GIGANTIC. (Tropical Punch, Blue Raspberry, and 1 other flavor)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

My boyfriend and I shared the chicken gizzards, 1 thigh & 1 drumstick combo with 1 waffle, and the shrimp and grits. The Shrimp and Grits took a while to come out since it's made fresh so I wouldn't recommend ordering it if you're crunched for time to catch a flight out like me.

Overall, the food was delicious and I don't think you could go wrong with anything here at Lo-Lo's. The waffle has a cinnamon taste to it that I am sure is unique to Lo-Lo's, it's amazing. Do not skip the waffles!

The portion sizes are huge which gives you a great value for your money. Everyone there was very nice and accommodating. I would highly recommend this place to anyone for some good food and great service."}
{"text":"All I gotta say is... Oh hell yes!! The waffle was sweet but not too sweet and the chicken breast was moist and wonderfully flavorful!  But the combination is fantastic!! My husband says Roscoe's doesn't even compare to Lo-Lo's...  Oh and to top it off I had the mac n cheese and a tub of kool-aid!! This place is the ONLY reason I would ever come back to Phoenix!! I am pleasantly stuffed!! Thanks Lo-Lo's!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Double D which is 2 chicken breasts ( fried of course ) with a waffle & side of maple syrup. It was great! The sweet tea was a nice complement to the meal. I came here with 2 colleague's and they both said their meals were great. Dan ordered a beer and server came back and told him they were out. So he ordered an alternative and the server came back and said they were out. So he ordered a jack and coke and was told it was made with pineapple or some dark rum and he sent it back. Morale of the story? Come here to eat but dont come to drink."}
{"text":"Best place ever !! The food was amazing ! Like seriously it's was mind blowing amazing just see for yourself ."}
{"text":"Could be better with little improvements. I've been here twice and ordered carry out both times. The parking situation was a mess with the only real option to use the valet service which was free. I didn't really want to use it considering I was just going to be there for a short time but it would be good for someone dining in. 

On to the food. The waffles were pretty good but the chicken lacked seasoning both times that I had it. The chicken itself was cooked well but it just didn't have much of a taste. With better tasting chicken this place would be fantastic."}
{"text":"It was busy, but we got to sit at the bar. Good service, food came out promptly. Overall good experience,  chicken was very tasty."}
{"text":"Save money!  Eat at Lolo's!  Go here for an early lunch and you are set for the day!  Perhaps a small snack 6-8 hours later but that's pretty much it!

My second visit to Lolo's didn't quite measure up to the first visit...and still it was 4 stars.

Great company with a group of Yelpers and my family too!

Seriously, I was full 6 hours after eating here."}

{"text":"Maybe I'm a little biased because I'm from Louisiana, home of the fried chicken. The chicken was OKAY, for $4 a piece it's a little pricey. The waffles were thin enough to be crunchy, just how I like it. The cheese grits? Hard pass. It's literally melted cheese and a block of butter on plain grits. I was expecting grits cooked with cheese and butter, yes it does make a difference. Huge difference. The kool aid was sweet. Like slap of diabetes sweet. All the waiters were great except for mine. She dropped off my food and she was staring at the door. When I said thank you, she must have realized I was there and said enjoy your meal, to the door. She dropped off my check and a to go box. But another waitress had to pick up my check and get me a larger to go box. I wanted a bag to put my to go box in, I guess after I pay I don't get anymore help because she was no where to be seen. 
Overall, okay food and one of the worst service I've experienced."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is expensive for being in the hood. I had a catfish samich with Mac and cheese and a drink  $20.45 without tip. Ya go to church's or Popeye's if your on Obama care."}
{"text":"I drove from Los Angeles for a conference in Phoenix so I did a little research and decided to stop at Lolo's first before heading to the hotel.  I am glad I did but not so much.  The chicken was very good.  They pulled a Church's number and added parts of the breast to every wing, giving you a big piece of meat.  The breading was tasty and the meat was moist and juicy.  However, that was where it ended for me.  The waffle was okay, it had a cinnamon taste to it that was different but it was very thin and small (maybe I am just used to Roscoe's).  The mac and cheese was very rich but too rich.  I was basically cheese sauce with some macaroni thrown in.  I couldn't complete the whole thing.  I was just about on my way out the door when I saw someone's sweet potato pie.  I turned back around and ordered one for dessert.  Shouldn't of done that.  I was not impressed with the taste so that was wasted also.  I would stop here for the chicken but I am not pressed to try anything else."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here. They do not have this in NYC. The food reminded me of Sylvia's in Harlem. It was absolutely delicious. I had the 3 piece Chicken, with Waffles, with eggs and Grits. The food and service was amazing. And their fruit drinks was on point. Whenever you are in Phoenix, this is a must stop and get food place."}
{"text":"We come all the way from San Diego to get our Lo-Los fix! The food is excellent and the service is so friendly. I'm from the South so my expectations are very high. Anyone who says Roscoes is better than Lo-Los is a delusional \"hype beast\"and most likely never had real soul food. They have plenty of delicious options aside from their chicken and waffles. This place is the real deal."}
{"text":"Horrible!!!!! I was at this location about 
3 months ago and I was reminded why it had been so long! The service is terrible there's no sense of urgency or customer service. Our food came out 47 minutes after we ordered although the server was very apologetic the manager NEVER came to the table to apologize. The \"taste\" of the food was good but it was cold my chicken breast was dry and probably the smallest chicken breast I've ever seen. I mentioned it to the food runner he rolled his eyes and walked away! WOW!!! My husbands order was wrong he ate it anyway and when he ask for a water refill it literally took 10 minutes after the server took his glass, When we reminded him we needed the water still he said he had to request water refills with kitchen! Huh? Very disappointed, just not worth it! Guaranteed if they had a competitor close by Lo Lo's would cease to exist. Longest Lunch known to man thank God it was my day off."}
{"text":"2nd time  here since we tried it on saturday!  My son says it's the best catfish fry he ever had. portions are huge. it's only 10am and the place is good!! 

shrimp and grits is awesome, chicken and waffles better than roscoe's. 

service is great and friendly!"}
{"text":"I've seen chicken & waffles on food network, made it myself at home - never \"got it\". So we went out to a real *chicken & waffle\" joint... surely then I'll understand the allure of this unnatural pairing. 
I still don't get it. 
Chicken was okay,  nothing  special ; waffles okay (cinnamon was a nice touch); mac & cheese good, but we make it as good @ home with Velveeta; collards good, little spice was nice, but again we make better. Hot sauce was standard Louisiana hot sauce, nothing unique. 
Leaving, I noticed a big bowl of shrimp mac & cheese, and server said it s best thing on the menu... now you tell me. 
Good service, quick seating & service, food overall = meh. Good, not great. Again, the only unique thing is the pairing, and I don't get it."}
{"text":"I've never had chicken and waffles but after today's meal at LoLo's I'm officially a huge fan! The food here is so good!!! I had upside down pineapple pancakes with hot links and a mimosa. My husband ordered the LoLo's chicken and waffles and a cucumber melon mojito. We did sampling of each other's plates. From the drinks to the food it was absolutely amazing! Not only was the food on point but the service was as well! We will definitely be visiting again"}
{"text":"Tried this place yesterday for the first time and it was okay, it was packed but the wait was short. My server was very friendly, as for the food, I got the biscuits and gravy well uhh biscuits were dry, and not that much gravy on em, the chicken breast that I ordered was dry, I was a little let down but maybe ill have to try a dif dish next time because for being the first time here it didn't wow me at all."}
{"text":"Five stars for service, three and a half for food.

We ate here on a Sunday morning and had nothing but attentive service from all of their staff.  For example, my girlfriend's sweet tea was running a little low on ice and one of the servers (not ours) just walked by and mentioned she thought the tea needed more ice!  Frequent refills, friendly attitudes, and just an overall feeling of \"being taken care of\" were highlights. 

As far as the food, the chicken was inconsistent and waffles were average.  The chicken (leg and thigh) could have used a hint more seasoning, while the wing was seasoned perfectly.  The thigh was a bit undercooked, the leg a bit overcooked.  The waffles were soft, somewhat heavy, and had way too much cinnamon.  

Everything was good but not great, and while the food won't bring me back the service just might.  And I'd like to try other things on the menu, including another round of the chicken and waffles to see if my experience differs next time.

Finally A+ for being a family owned, Phoenix-based eatery.  We need more places like this and less garbage chain restaurants."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. The menu has improved a lot and the quality of the food is always the same. The koolaid is a must have any flavor. The only reason for 4star because service is pretty slow. I had went on a Wednesday about 6:40pm. We set down right away. Ordered right away but our food did not come out till 7:50 a hour 10mina later. The waitress was pleasant and stopped by to let us know it will be out shortly. Hour wait on food was a little to long we had a child and they can barely set still for 10mins let alone over hour waiting on food. Not sure if they was short cooks but it was not extremely busy in the restaurant that's only reason 4stars."}
{"text":"We ate at the bar top and our bartender/ server was not at all inviting barley even spoke to us. At the time there was only one other person at the bar top. Every time we spoke to him if seemed to be a inconvenience thank god a second bartender came in and was wonderful but honesty the Mood had already been set. So uncomfortable."}
{"text":"To start with, and to be fair, lets just say that Lo-Lo's is not 'my cup of tea\"
Its super heavy, greasy, and the drinks are sweet (if you are a health person like me- I would not recommend).  I felt like I needed to go to bed and sleep after my meal here- the food is HEAVY.  Now that being said, if that is what you are looking for, which I think most people who come her are, then it deserves a higher rating.  but Yelp is about your experience, so I'm just being honest.  
I came here with 2 friends on a Saturday around 2pm and waited for about 45 minutes to be seated.  I will give them a huge complement on their servers.  The guy who helped us was super nice and a great server.
If southern fried food is what you are looking for, I'm sure you will love this place.  If you value your health, go next door to the Noodle Ranch (which has some amazing Vietnamese food)"}
{"text":"Great food! Amazing actually but some of the patrons need to watch their kids. Hanging out on couches like punks in a neighborhood."}
{"text":"What more can I say. Got the chicken and waffles, #8, kids split the Oreo waffles, hubs got chicken and waffles too. All delish. Also tried the Mac and cheese because I love that shit, good.... Didn't taste like REAL cheese though, loved the corn fritters though. Spicy and delish. Kool Aid is on point, expensive for what it is. Overall I can NOT wait to come back, and our server AJ was great!"}
{"text":"We landed on Christmas Day and knew we had to eat in the airport.  I travel a lot for work and eat in airports too often.  

We got 4 different meals.  They were all fantastic.  The chicken was moist and tasty.  The waffle was perfect.  The hot sauce and syrup went perfectly.  

The price point was good.  The service was excellent.

Other is our group that took off from terminal 4 (we took off from terminal 2), went back to Lo-Lo's on their home.

Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I heard lots of good things about this place, but just as I was disappointed with Mrs. White's, Lolo's didn't live up to the hype either. I ordered the #9, which was a leg, thigh and a waffle. The waffle was pretty good: airy, light, crunchy at first bite and soft inside. The chicken was the disappointment: the meat was well seasoned, but many parts of the thigh were dry, and neither piece was crunchy at all. It seemed like it had been fried awhile ago and kept warm under a light. Is it distasteful of me to prefer KFC chicken, where the turnover is fast so most of the chicken arrives freshly fried? (although I find KFC to be excessively salty, where as Lolo's seasoning was just right). 

Either way, I've had this once and it wasn't bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way for a second try."}
{"text":"Good service, great food, $3 mimosas, good for brunch unless you wanna get hammered because this is a family restaurant. I got the combo with chicken tenders and gravy with 2 sides (Mac and cheese and fried okra). Mac and cheese was ok, a bit over cooked, but I recommend the fried okra. Also comes with a choice of a biscuit or corn bread, in which the waiter recommended corn bread and I was not displeased."}
{"text":"Long waits.

However, its the best food. The place is trendy, and I love the old brick walls. The seats can sometimes hurt your butt so maybe sit in a booth.

oh, and get the koolaid!"}
{"text":"If you want a Lo-lo's Chicken & Waffles experience, do yourself a favor and check out an in-town location. Having tried both the Scottsdale location and this one, I would definitely say that it felt like they were owned by two entirely different entities. 

The chicken was dry, but they tried to cover it up by soaking it up in their gravy. The side of vegetables (string bean?) we got looked like garbage. I have no idea how garbage tastes like, but I'm pretty sure if anything, I got a good idea of it from their side of vegetables."}
{"text":"Despite some reviews I read about the not so great service, I still decided to give this place a try because it was so near the hotel. I called three times to place an order to pick up and no one answered the phone. It was around 11:40 AM. So then I walked over. There is a dedicated to go ordering window. I stood there for ten minutes before someone finally acknowledged me. After ringing up my order for a salad, the waitress kept the coins in my change due without any explanation. I was going to tip her more money than that but because of her keeping the money and promptly walking away, I didn't tip. 

At this point, I have been waiting 30 mins for my salad. I just asked a lady that was giving other people their to go orders about my order. (All those persons arrived after me.) She said she didn't take my order and walked away. When she came back to deliver another order, I asked her to check on my salad. 

I'm now back at the hotel. It took about 35 minutes for a very basic salad with greens, 3 cherry tomatoes, 1/8 of an avocado, and chicken. I just ate most of the salad and at the bottom of the salad, there was bacon. I specifically said NO bacon. 

That salad was $13 and totally not worth it! And to have such bad service on top of it makes me feel like I wasted my money."}
{"text":"Sad to say, this rating is barely three stars....... 

The name itself sounds so good (and decadent); chicken and waffles, what a delicious combination of tastes and textures. 

Maybe it's because we live in Savannah, but Lolo's was kind of a big disappointment to me. I've had far better fried chicken at Mrs. Wilkes, Sweet Potatoes Kitchen and even Barnes. And sadly, the waffles offered in the complimentary breakfast offered at the Hampton Inn where we stayed were better then Lolo's. Collard greens were overly salted, macaroni and cheese bland, and the french fries so heavily seasoned that it was impossible to taste potato. The high point of the meal was the sweet tea. 

Service was pleasant, but brisk. Surroundings clean but diner-like. All in all, nothing special.

Four adults and a two-year-old dined on varying combinations of the aforementioned foods, there's not a lot of other menu choices, and spent a startling $63.19 before the tip, not inexpensive! 

To sum it up, when you're longing for fried chicken, forget Lolo's and come to Savannah, y'all."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a month and love it. Sometimes it is better then others but I am always full and happy when I leave. I only go on Sunday mornings because of the gospel music and to get waited on by one of the twin brothers."}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of LoLo's since they first started in central Phoenix in the small house and to see the restaurant experience nationwide growth is great. The menu items are similar but you won't find the exact same thing if you frequent visitor to the restaurant (limited menu). You can still get your order tweaked for certain things (ie type of chicken piece or with gravy). I decided to go with waffle cooked well and breast and wing which is basically a Betty Boob with an extra wing aka the Sheeda's Special I've always known. 

Seasoning on the food was not so great and the waffle was a little bit flat. I was expecting a little bit more seasoning on the chicken so that's why it receives a 3 star review this time around. 

Customer service was good but keep in mind you should always ask if there is a long delay when it comes to cooking as chicken can take anywhere from 12 to 20 minutes to cook. I tend to ask what do you have available in the crunch for the time as I am at the airport and still have to go through Security. It would be nice to if they could do orders to be served on a plate versus being in a box, but I get it when you're at the airport as you never know when you have to pick up and run. 

Hoping my next experience is better as I do plan to come back. If your traveling through and didn't get a chance to dine at the restaurant, swing by and judge for yourself if a returned trip is required."}
{"text":"Good customer service but compared to the original downtown location the food is not  as good. I had high hopes walking into this place. It just seemed the food was very muck lacking in appearance and flavor."}
{"text":"Ahhhh....Lo-Lo's....the best of the best when it comes to Phoenix's (early) late night delights. The soul food here is to die for--definitely THE BEST in the valley. If you've never been to Lo-Lo's you're missing out. Period.

Overall, the wait is worth the fried gold at the end of the rainbow."}
{"text":"The worst experience at a baseball field venue. I am not posting in regards to the food but the 15 minutes it took to get food 30 minutes prior to game time.

There was a total lack of order on the line. The gentlemen on the fryer had to stab pieces of Chix to make sure they were cooked as he put all legs, thighs and breasts in together not knowing that they all need different times to cook

When chicken was done, there were no waffles

When waffles were done they were no fires

When fries were done, no chicken was ready

I was 30 seconds from demanding a refund when they called out my order"}
{"text":"Amazing food & experience. If visiting Phoenix like we are this is a must on your agenda."}
{"text":"If you want a large glass of cold ice water served perfectly with a bendy straw this is YOUR place! And then it pretty much stops there. I've been wanting to try this place for a while. The high star reviews, appearances on the morning news, and recommendations from people really made me excited to eat here. However, I thought the chicken was okay. And my waffles were soggy. I like waffles to have just a slight crisp with a soft center and these were bendy and chewy all the way to the edges. In all honesty I think that the fried chicken at the Safeway counters are better. I've had really good chicken and waffles before (separately mad served together) and this was just meh. It felt like a tired chain restaurant - which is weird because this is one of two locations. I think until I find a good chicken and waffles place, I'll drive through chickfila and make some eggos at home... 

And one last note: They play music at an annoyingly high volume on poor quality speakers."}
{"text":"My family and I came here all the way from CA to see what the fuss was all about. We called in a to go order and waited a very long time to get it. It was a weekday and seemed pretty busy. After about 15-20 minutes, we finally go our order. The dining room is large and they also have a small patio. The bathrooms aren't anything special. Good in size but not very clean. The parking is very limited but they do have a parking lot next to their building that can accommodate several cars with a short walk to the restaurant. The decent sized lot however, does have two very large potholes. Now the food. The chicken was decently sized and tasty, but I've had better. The waffles were horrible in my opinion. Pretty expensive for what you get. And the service wasn't so great either. So overall, I'm glad I tried it but won't be returning."}
{"text":"Experienced this restaurant twice & the chicken & waffles are pretty good. The chicken could use a little salt but other than that it was fried to perfection. The waffle is just okay. Not sure if they use actual waffle maker to make them fresh per order or if they are frozen and heated. I've had better."}
{"text":"2 stars for the food that was good, ZERO stars for the horrible service.  I don't mind waiting for a table, but when you're eventually sat you shouldnt wait 20 minutes to be greeted by a server.  Never saw the server again after the order was taken until we flagged him down to pay.  No managers table touching, couldn't even find someone to ask for extra silverware.  Food was good though, it's a shame that the service was horrendous!  They need server training 101."}
{"text":"Been going to lolos for as long as I can remember.  For some reason, the scottsdale location is always subpar.  Today after a longer than usual wait for our food, the chicken came out waaaay overdone and dry.  Waitress was awesome, she offered to bring out a new batch.   New batch came and it was the same.  This chicken should have NEVER left the kitchen.  Someone needs to implement some quality control at the scottsdale location.  Going forward, I'll just stick the Phoenix OG spot for my fix."}
{"text":"This place is \"Good to Go\"! I actually like it better than \"Roscoes Chicken and Waffles\" in my opinion. It's not a 5 because the gravy and green fried tomatoes could use help in the seasoning department. The music is \"on point\"! Old school music takes me back to high school (80's). I definitely like this place and will be back."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour with friendly Service & some of the Best Wings I ever had . Ask for TR the best bartender happy hour is 3pm to 7 pm"}
{"text":"Had two chicken legs and frys. Just ok. Serves is slow and you get help after finish private phone call. Good thing, food is hot."}
{"text":"I really wonder why this place has such a good review. Maybe because there's really nothing else in AZ...
I had the chicken with gravy and onions. I eat fried chicken all the time, but never feel so close to a heart attack. It was too much! Too much of everything. Too much flavor, too much gravy, too much onion, i don't know. Just thinking about it make me full...
And they have a very limited selection of soda (who would have thought?!). No sprite, no ginger ale...."}
{"text":"So it was through Lo-Lo's that I was introduced to the concept of chicken and waffles. The peculiar mash-up had sounded a bit odd to me, but not beyond trying. I'm not sure if they even have other items on the menu as I've always just had chicken and waffles. I've had Lo-Los to go and eaten on-site numerous times. If you eat in, they serve the drinks in mason jars, and the overly-attentive wait staff never leave you with less than a half-full jar before offering you a refill. 

The fried chicken is the best I've ever had period! It's even better than the stalwart California chain and institution, Roscoes. The other day I had fried chicken at home and found myself putting Frank's Red Hot and syrup over it before I deemed it worthy to eat. Lo-Los made me do that."}
{"text":"I went here on a date once and it was nice. The food was pretty good, a bit pricey but good. Eating soul food, laughing and being in a comfortable environment made the experience enjoyable. I will definitely being going back very soon! I tried the fried fish with sides and next time I go I will be having the signature chicken and waffles dish!"}
{"text":"Best sweet tea, and waffles! Fried green tomatoes are perfect and the cornbread  Mac n cheese is legit. I could eat here daily."}
{"text":"A must try, Chicken is great. I have never had this combo before, but will say it was better then I thought"}
{"text":"Had the lolo special and it was very delicious!  Fast service too.   Oh the red koolaid was on hit too!"}
{"text":"Great service Great food. Very appreciative to the employees who prepared and made it possible for us to get to go orders for all us of us that were at work ....best food in a long time! Thank you Lynn."}
{"text":"Fun, cute decor. Looks like a hole in the wall & located in a questionable looking area but those can be the best places. I had...surprise...chicken & waffles - both were delicious! The wait for our food was a little long but enjoyed the experience nonetheless."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Lo-lo's knows whats up when it comes to chicken and waffles! The menu has a huge amount of chicken, waffles, eggs, grits and many other combos! Music is going (pretty sure TLC was enjoyed by all!). What a fun dining experience with off the charts comfort food!"}
{"text":"Good chicken, tasty waffle and nice, clean decor. It was a clean restaurant all around including the restrooms. We didn't have the wait problem. We actually received our food really quick. We did wait 2-3 minutes for the waiter in the beginning but it wasn't a big deal. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon. Staff is very overwhelmed. They erased our name from the waiting list without ever calling us. 9 tables were dirty with the customers gone. No one to bus the tables so we waited extra long. Just got seated. The food is usually good here.. we will see."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Customers are lined up around the corner waiting to get a table just about every weekend."}
{"text":"One delirious food coma, a heavy dollop of cholesterol, two thick slices of saturated fat and a mild case of diabetic shock, to go please!

Translation: Let's split the sweet tea, a pile of fried chicken, some waffles, the fried okra, cheesy eggs with onions, a bowl of mac n' cheese and a slice of red velvet cake to go. 

Brimstone was on the air, a haunting violin dirge could be heard wafting through my head, and a sinking feeling settled at the bottom of my gut. We just made a deal with the devil and we didn't even know it. 

That or I was just too hungry to function properly.

But I do know that I would do terrible, devious things in the name of these chicken and waffles. Pawnshops would know me by name and assume I had a hard drug problem, but my only addiction would be the sweet fried perfection of Lolo's Chicken and Waffles!

Perfectly spiced, crisp but not overly battered, moist fried chicken that even Colonel Sanders would sell his soul for, provided he hasn't already done so in his quest for chicken dominance. 

Crunchy, buttery waffles with a hint of sweetness that are good on their own or smothered in warm maple syrup, that totally wipe the floor with those perpetratin' Waffle House hockey pucks.

Creamy, cheesy, smooth and decadent mac and cheese. A tribute to the best of Granny's kitchen and an affirmation that Kraft should be drawn and quartered for their powdered cheese monstrosity.

And sweet tea that quenches the thirst and makes your teeth hurt its so effing good! Or red Kool-aid, lemonade, fountain drinks, or regular unsweetened tea for you nonbelievers out there.

Almost everything at Lolo's is done well, except for their red velvet cake. It's dense and moist but the devil's food taste (it's chocolate cake with about three bottles of red food coloring in it for those of you that think red is the flavor) is weak and the cream cheese frosting was so thin that there wasn't nearly enough to lubricate the bland, meaty red slice. It was a disappointment. 

But on the bright side, maybe this is confirmation that we didn't make a deal with the devil, cuz his cake was weak."}
{"text":"Mmmm mmmm! So good! Best comfort food in Phoenix, so far.
I was greeted immediately and seated. The waiter was prompt in collecting my drink order...he had me at \"Kool-Aid\"...blue goodness!

The restaurant is really cute. I can imagine that any party would enjoy themselves here comfortably. The music selections seemed to be a soundtrack just for me. I sang each and every song played, when I wasn't eating.

I ordered waffles, grits, eggs and hot links. Yep, reminded me of the country breakfasts my grandparents made for me. 

So much food, I definitely couldn't eat it all. My meal was $15.

I'll be back to check out the bar and the soul food/dinner options."}
{"text":"I literally cut & paste the beginning of this from another reviewer who went on 6/7:  Love Lo Lo's and have been dining with them for a long time when they were in their original location and expanded to the 2nd location in Scottsdale. 

Tonight's experience was a little disappointing with the entire experience. 

We went on 6/10/15, and it was not good.   We had gone a few weeks ago, had chicken & waffles, and sides were not edible.  I ordered the beans & rice, and one bite, and it had to go to the side.   Last night was another poor experience.

Started with appetizers, never had them before, so why not.  The fried pickles reminded me of generic frozen fried pickles you can get at grocery store.  Not edible.   The corn fritters were not what was expected, corn/jalapeño, not really a fritter, cause the inside was not 'frittery' if that makes sense - more edible, just not what I expected in a fritter.    Fried green beans were the best - as compared to the other 2.

Dinner, I had catfish, which was GREAT, however, it lacked some 'sauce', cause it's dry, and the only sauces available are their proprietary hot sauce on the table & ketchup.   I miss the vinegar w/ the pepper, that is no longer available.   The sides.  Collards..  My fave, cause you know they were cooked for HOURS - well, this wasn't.  They were still 'stiff' and no spice or ham hoc flavor.  (this was my 2nd experience with them this way, so I think this is there 'newer' style.  Disappointing, cause I liked them so tender and smokey and spice, and yeah, gone.   Mac & cheese was my other side, and it wasn't special - wouldn't order it again either.

I guess if you are ordering chicken & waffles - nothing else, you're good, but caution to other items.  They do not live up to the greatness of their staple dish."}
{"text":"We almost wish we had to see the doctor more often because we come down from Prescott for the appt and then treat ourselves to Lolo's where the chicken is \"finger-licking good\",  mac & cheese is the best comfort food and the little bite in the collard greens spices things up.  Worth the ride, don't miss out; you'll never do KFC, Bojangles, Popeye's or Church's chicken ever again."}
{"text":"Food tastes amazing...friendly cashier.. Great location in airport to pick up food as go in or as your leaving..gave 3 stars because of the price.. I got one waffle, two small chicken wings, and a side of greens for 15$.....that's a lot of money  for such a small amount of food with no drink"}
{"text":"Great teas and kool-aid. The chicken and waffles are pretty yummy-- not phenomenal, but definitely satisfying."}
{"text":"Came here after a while...menu change so which is ok.. I orders a drink never had before when it came way way after I ordered it..
 I saw the bartender attend to several people before making my drink...food was ordered the waitress seemed moody which after seeing the place I kinda understand but still service with a smile how Lolo's always been..

Food...meh..now the wow it used to be...i been here to the Gilbert location and it is always hit and miss..today was a meh....the greens were not as good as before chicken seemed soggy...

Wait my drink finally came...wow horrible... to much bitters destroyed what could have been a great drink....

Top it off the place was a pig pen no one seemed happy.. I will continue to go to the main place and really begun to miss the old little house where i knew the waitresses and they greeted me with a smile and apologized if slightly messy slow service and so on...

No happy..Gilbert has lost my service...."}
{"text":"This place was my first experience with chicken and waffles and man it was GOOD! The place was super authentic. Loved the waitresses and waiters. Though it was really hectic trying to serve our table, they all had a great sense of humor and were just overall very friendly.

Now to the food. Man, who knew how good the fried chicken-waffle combo is. However to be honest, the fried fish was even better! If i ever go back here, that's the combo I'd be getting...fried fish and waffles. It sounds not as appetizing, but trust me! It's good!"}
{"text":"I gave this place 2 stars only because it's the best tasting chicken waffles in town...wait it's the ONLY one in town! Food is actually good. Tastes just like it sounds. But don't expect much in the service department. 

Also what kind of breakfast places doesn't open until 9am?!? Laziness or stupidity? I would think if you wanted to survive this economy, it may be wise to not only cater to the unemployed and retirees that have the luxury of enjoying breakfast after 9am. ? Don't most of us need to get to work by then?!? 

Oh well, I'm sure a chicken and waffles spot will have plenty of success in SCOTTSDALE!"}
{"text":"Went to LoLo's today for lunch.  Oh my!  Everything we had was good.  I had a fried chicken breast, waffle and mac'n'cheese.  My husband is from the south and he said the mac was as good as his grandmother's.  I hear she was a good cook.  Definitely not for those who are on a diet.  We'll be back - soon!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere. Some of the waffles are so rich they're a dessert-- but that's not a bad thing!"}
{"text":"Turned away due to \"city water issue\" but people who arrived right before us were seated."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try some fantastic soul food and the menu didn't disappoint  but almost everything else did. 

The wait time to get into the restaurant was reasonable and they do offer a nice outside lounge to wait at but it went downhill from there. 

Our table of five was placed in the COOP room. The acoustics of that room made it incredibly loud. The surfaces are all hard, the sound of the metal chairs scratching against the concrete reminds one of nails on chalkboard, but that's ok. It's part of the vibe. The AC was icy though, perhaps because we were under the vent. Our server was quick and pleasant and the drinks arrived promptly.

We mainly ordered some variation of fried chicken and associated sides with one of our party ordering the shrimp and grits.  Forty-five minutes later (the magic of texting and time stamps) the food came. There was no unprompted check in to explain why the wait was so long. When the food arrived we were told it was the shrimp and grits, almost like it was our fault for ordering it. 

The taste of the food was OK. The shrimp and grits were hot but it seemed that the chicken had sat waiting for the last of the order to be completed. The waffle was warm and the corn muffins outstanding. The rice in the dirty rice was not fully cooked and the mac and cheese had congealed during the wait. 

I'm sure our experience would have been better had the food been hot and arrived more promptly or at least with some apology. It's always better to tell the truth and say we're sorry we forgot to make an item on your ticket than to claim something like shrimp and grits takes 45 minutes to prepare."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. When we arrived they told us there would be a short wait, after 30 minutes they told us that their waffle makers were broken, but since so many people were leaving that we should get seated quickly. 30 minutes later, when we went to ask what was going on, we were told that the managers weren't letting anyone be seated and that the earliest we can be seated is in an hour and 10 minutes... didn't even get to try the food but the customer service was less than impressive"}
{"text":"My first visit to Lo Lo's I have to admit, was totally against my will. It was my parents idea to take me there for my birthday a few years ago and I wasn't too keen on the idea. Now I'm a regular, at least as much as my stomach can handle it. The portions are enormous, and delicious. I always order the #2, it's smothered chicken with waffles, with a kool aid, and it is perfect. Probably going to give me a heart attack, but you gotta live! You gotta show up early, even on a weekday for lunch this place gets packed, and you have to wait outside where its hot. Probably 8 of my 10 visits have been on sunday mornings after a hard saturday night at Rose and Crown or another pub, so it hits the spot for those mornings perfectly. 

Oh, and to those saying this place is good for groups, what the hell? It's a small restaurant that doesn't take reservations. What about that is good for groups?"}
{"text":"Five stars for me. The restaurant was clean and the staff was amazing. Mike.....you're the man, GREAT JOB!! The food was amazing. The alcoholic drinks were amazing. The atmosphere was loud because it was a Friday night. Other than that....no complaints. I've had Roscoe's chicken and waffles in California but I believe this establishment is remarkably better. Great work!"}
{"text":"LoLos was highly recommended by my coworkers so I decided to take a date there. It was ok, nothing special. I'd say the hype was overblown, to be honest. I mean, the palce is exactly what it says -- chicken and waffles. I can heat up some Tyson chicken strips, toast 4 Strawberry Eggos and save myself the gas. The sweet tea was good (served in a mason jar if I recall correctly), but I can't give the place more than 3 stars since chicken and waffles seems hardly innovative."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 meals.I ordered puff Chicken.
 I was told it would take 10 minutes or more. Gave my name went to get coffee.
While I was gone the food was ready and they only gave my wife 2 if the 3 meals I paid for.
 When I return my wife said they did not have your meal. I Went to the counter the girl say what did you order.

I said I already paid. The girl said ok that will be 10 or more minutes.

I thought wow no I am sorry its on us for your inconvenience.

No I waited 10 more minutes.
So thats 20 plus minutes for a meal.
I was done with Ms. Whites and Lolo's for  The lack of being professional.
Ms Whites the cook was stressing out the Server. The server even said

 \"The cook is on one today
BLACK BUSINESSES DO MATTER.

Some of them need to come up."}
{"text":"I loved it! Today was my first time eating with Lo Lo's, and I loved it! I ordered red Kool Aid, Lo Lo's and cheese grits. Everything was delicious! Our server was John, he was attentive and courteous.  Great customer service! Also the interior had a rustic look that I loved. Next time I'm in Arizona I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food is always great. The chicken is exellent delicious i should say. The service is not so good cause they're always packed with people. But they try the best that they can. Will be back here as there"}
{"text":"Place rocks as ususl.  As a native, I have an appreciation for the morhership that started it all, Mrs. Whites.  I support this local family who is branching off and paying homage at the same time.  Food is out of sight.  TOTAL comfort food, down to every cheesy covered macaroni noodle.  If you've never had chicken & waffles you owe it to yourself to try it.  If your not ready for that, anything (tons of choices) on the menu is great!!"}
{"text":"Living in Seattle with a billion restaurants, you'd think they would be amazing soul food. Unfortunately that's NOT the case. Whenever I eat at one of the \"okay\" soul food places I think: why can't they be as good as Lo-Lo's? And then I start dreaming of Lo-Lo's Soul Food Platter with smothered fried chicken and waffles. It's so much food I can't finish it. But who doesn't love leftovers? You get A LOT of bang for your buck and the service is superb. They really make you feel at home, great hospitality. I never have room for dessert so I get the red velvet cake and whatever other delicious dessert special they have to go. Speaking of red velvet cake, I never liked that cake till I had it at Lo-Lo's. There's something special about their version of that cake. With my bag of leftovers and dessert to go I end up eating all over again around midnight munchie time...heaven!

Fortunately I have family in Tucson so I purposely fly into Phoenix and hit Lo-Lo's before going to Tuscon. And I try to schedule my flight out around Lo-Lo's too. That's how much I love Lo-Lo's. See you in February--can't wait! Drooling until then..."}
{"text":"We don't have roscoes c&w in phoenix.  We have lolos which even has a location at sky harbor. It is impossible to please everyone. So dont expect excellent customer service there are waaay too many people packed up in here Lol. Most importantly it is worth the wait for great food."}
{"text":"Short and sweet here! This place is awesome!!! Everything is great!!!! Maple Syrup of the best kind. You must try!!!"}
{"text":"I really love this location. Excellent customer service, great food, and music. I shall be back."}
{"text":"The closest to Roscoe's that I've ever found. Yes, Roscoe's is better - but NOT BY MUCH. I think the waffles were a tad bit sweeter than Roscoe's (perhaps a bit too sweet for me?), but overall the combination is perfection! This will be very high on my list for my return visits to Phoenix. It's relatively close to the airport and worth the drive if you are on a layover. YUM. 

As a side note, the beverage menu is pretty freaking hilarious as well. They serve HUGE jars of kool-aid (and I saw many people getting REFILLS of their 60+ ounce kool-aid). I guess the only thing better than a 2000 calorie breakfast is another 2000 calories of bright red artificial awesomeness to wash it down with :)"}
{"text":"I love going to Lo-Lo's.  It's unique and clever, the food is terrific, and the wait is reasonable - standard breakfast waiting.  The whole concept of Chicken with Waffles appeals to me on so many levels. It's a great place to take visitors and family members who have never been there.  It leaves a smile on your face for the whole day!"}
{"text":"Ordered a number 1 and killed it......I have never had chicken and waffles together or been to Lo-los...Here is the lo down:

Great chicken, nice fried chicken with a great tasting flower mix for the fried skin.  It tasted fresh and the chicken was nicely cooked.  It came out super hot so I had to eat it last.

The waffles were fresh and soft.  Nice scoop of butter on top with maple syrup to drown the butter onto the waffles.  The waffles are large, fluffy, soft and delish.  Get the waffles, had a touch of Cinnamon in them as well.

I had some sunny side up eggs also and with the fresh onions and shredded cheese on top it really added some addition flavors to my eggs.  The crunch of the onions with the soft liquid egg helps add texture.

At last the last portion of the number 1, and my least favorite item was the grits.  It is a nice helping of grits, comes in its own bowl with a nice scoop of butter to add flavor.  Unfortunately the butter does not have salt and the grit lacked salt so the grits was basically flavorless.  No worries salt shaker in hand I corrected the lack of salt and enjoyed the grits.  I just wished it had more flavor in it.  

A number one includes all that is listed above and is for someone with a serious appetite.  Bring your appetite and $15 and you will be full of delicious fried chicken, soft and delish waffles, and wonderfully cooked eggs."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places!! They have the best chicken and waffles you will ever eat!! And really good corn bread"}
{"text":"Well, well, well, this was a gem for real!   Love the atmosphere. Love the music, oldies. Love the service. Our server, named Sir, was helpful attentive, funny, and a pleasure to be with.  But the real reason you come to a restaurant, the food! You will not be disappointed here. The food was tasty, prepared well, served hot. No complaints!. If ever you come through the Phoenix area be sure to stop."}
{"text":"Same great Lolo's fried chicken and waffles without the risk of getting stabbed or shot... and it WAS worth the risk to visit their South Phoenix location on occasion. The food is that good, it might even be the ultimate in comfort food! Lucky for us they have a new Scottsdale location where the most dangerous situation you could encounter might be a hungover Scottsdale \"clubber\" (who could scratch you with their Ed Hardy bling).

The only suggestion I have for them is to drop the prices about 25%"}
{"text":"One of the most unusual dining experiences of my life -- and fantastic! Chicken and waffles definitely work! I can also vouch for the red koolaid, mac-n-cheese, cornbread, and the smothered potatoes. If you're into grits I hear they are spectacular too.

Just be wary of the neighborhood, after dark you might not make it out alive. (not likely they are open long after dusk anyway...)"}
{"text":"This was my Mom and her BF's first breakfast in AZ last Saturday. We got there shortly after they opened and were 3 of only about 6 people in the place, so of course the service was very quick.  The \"soul food\" breakfast was a unique experience for me, but it works.  Mom got a fried chicken breast and potatoes, Dick had the chicken/waffles & scrambled eggs.  My meal of 1 egg OE, grits and 1 waffle was the perfect portion.  We had an iced tea, diet coke and coffee, and with the drinks our meal was only $30, not too shabby for the amount of food served.
There was nothing that we had that didn't exceed expectations, I'm sure Lolo's is here to stay."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time.  Wow talk about QUICK and yummy, and hot and delicous, oh yeah I am going back.  Good Value.  Service fantastic.  You gotta go check it out."}
{"text":"I would highly suggest coming here, granted there are only a few locations. However, the price is right, and their sweet tea is sweet! I love their corn bread. The service is real good too, just be sure you come sooner than later because there's usually a wait."}
{"text":"So its Saturday AM, and a group of folks are meeting for the month's SMUNCH gathering. The location doesn't thrill me, still I know better than to judge the look of the joint, still.. ok.. lets go eat.

The prices seem high $7 was my waffles 1 chicken leg (fried chicken..mm mm). I get a sweet tea, and I mean sweet tea, in a mason jar. That part was cool, reminded me of the Chuck Box, so no biggie in that respect, plus you can really get a lot of liquid into one of those...and they are easy to wash and maintain. That much I know from restaurant operations.

The food was good and I certainly was full till dinner, late dinner at that. On my way in a group of folks was leaving, the little girl got a bit ahead of everyone ..and the mom shouted out her to \"stay with the family\".. it was a cultural thing for me.. reminded of days in Georgia and other places where emphasis is placed on the family. 

Once inside I saw that same atmosphere, where it was definitely a family place, service was good, and the food came quick...and was yum. Maybe I just missed some good soul food. I wasn't brave enough for the greens and such..still had a great meal. 

Did I mention that the food was awesome..."}
{"text":"Lo Lo's never disappoints me in having the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. I decided to have breakfast here on Father's Day and knew I needed to be there early. I was there when the doors opened and was immediately seated. My server was quick to take my order and even made suggestions that I don't usually have. The grits. OMG they were so creamy and smooth. Not one mouth full had any lumps in it. The sign of some good grits. The chicken and waffles again were delicious. I love the original downtown location as it has a total different feel than the others.  Yes this is a repeater for me."}
{"text":"This is my first time to this location and I'm so impressed. It's actually bigger than the downtown location. That being said the food was amazing as always. I don't even have enough words to say how yummy everything was. Thanks again Lo Lo's for a perfect meal. 

December 15:  The worst experience here today. I almost got up and left. We sat and waited for about an hour for our food before we were told that the waffle irons were not functioning properly. I asked if we could just have our chicken and was told no because if we were brought ours before the other people who had been waiting it wouldn't be fair. So you're telling me we could all have been served our chicken until you got the waffle issue settled? I'm beyond upset at this point. Oh BTW, we had to ask what the problem was. No one had offered that information to us. So we were offered corn bread to appease our empty stomachs and then I guess they finally decided to give us all our chicken orders. The waffles did finally come but what is usually a great time at LoLo's turned into not so pleasant. I'm not sure I'm coming back to this location. Probably stick to going downtown to the original location."}
{"text":"Yup, the mothership has landed in Scottsdale.  Lo Lo's is incredible!

Wife and I went there at 4:30pm.  There were not many people there.  I had a wing and a breast and a waffle.  Wife had a breast and waffle and we shared a mac n cheese and a corn bread.  OMG!  This food is fantastic.  

I never thought I would have the best fried chicken, corn bread, mac n cheese and waffles in my life all in one sitting.  The waffles were delicious.  I think they throw in a good amount of cinnamon for flavor.  

The chicken pieces are huge and the breading is where it's at.  I for one will never be going back to KFC or Churches again.  This is the only place for chicken as far as I'm concerned.   

They also have unlimited kool aid in mason jars.  I sucked down 2."}
{"text":"This is one of my most favorite restaurants of mine! If your into soul food then you got to stop by in to Lo' Lo's ! They serve the best chicken and waffles everrrr!! And its not just chicken and waffles they also have delicious side dishes. Potatoe salad , macaroni and cheese & their famous corn bread!! And you can not go wrong with their homemade kool-aid! Hands down by far the best place to eat!"}
{"text":"Yes to the Fried Chicken & Waffles, banana pancakes, cornbread, biscuits and collard greens! One of the best biscuits I have had ever!!! And I consider myself a biscuit connoisseur. Truly a rare find in the Phoenix Area. Valet parking is available at the Scottsdale location. Also loved the blue koolaid and banana pudding"}
{"text":"Yes yes and yes!!!  Plan ahead but its worth the wait for some really good soul food.  The waffle and red beans are delicious!.  I don't think I ever been disappointed here and I've been coming here for about 3 years."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Lolo's, when I am craving for delicious mouthwatering calorie-fillled meal - it's hands down this place.Chicken is very tasty, the skin is crispy and the meat is juicy!  Beans is very good. I don't like their waffles though. It is soggy and ordinary. Their sweet tea is the best! The only downside is the long line during the weekends.
Overall, I am giving this a 4-star! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Chicken is crispy and juicy. Waffles are a great batter. Combination of waffles with syrup has a delicious cinnamony touch. Kool-Aid! Enough said."}
{"text":"If it was an option not to give any stars this place would get zero. I didn't even get to try the food and will say that I never will. I was meeting my Dad and brother for lunch and was very excited to try this place out. There was a 30 min wait and we had no problem waiting. I waited for 15 mins and my Dad arrived with my autistic little brother. We were about to be seated. My Dad brought my brother is own food which happened to be McDonald's fries and a drink because that's the only thing he will eat. They would not seat us because he had McDonald's. They said it was a health code issue and he had to finish it before we sat down. My Dad clearly stated he was autistic and the only way for us to all enjoy a meal together was if he had his McDonald's. We were going to be paying customers. My brother is very well behaved. So we left and tool our money else where. My mind is blown. We were denied services because my 9 year old Autistic brother had \"special\" eating habits. What if you have a child with allergies would they to be denied to eat at a family restaurant because they had to bring \"outside\" food with them so he could eat with the family. Baby food? That's outside food too... I saw lots of babies there that I'm sure had baby food. Horrible costumer service."}
{"text":"We seen the great reviews for this place and decided to go there for breakfast on our anniversary.  The parking here is vallet only... So don't be surprised to hand over your keys and have someone park for you.  The hosts were not very welcoming,  she made it seem like she had to go out of her way to take my name. The lady next to her was yelling \"NO STANDING IN ENTRY WAY - go outside or to the outside patio!!\" like how the heck am I supposed to know that or where the patio is, I've never been here in my life!  Very awkward and rude. Not a very comfortable environment at all.  The food was ok, and Kool aid and sweet tea was very very very sweet and music was turned up all the wayyy up.  The hosts were staring at everyone like hurry up and leave.  These people don't care about the quality of service, atleast not from my experience.  I thought about going back to try some of their other items on the menu but with their horrible hospitality I definitely won't go back.  I give it 2 stars because the place is nice and our server was nice.  It would of got 5 if the hospitality was better."}
{"text":"Best Mac and cheese I've had. I've been to Roscoe's in California and the Mac and cheese is definitely better here. 

The waffles here are delicious. They're sweet, warm and go down easily. The Red Velvet and Oreo pancakes could use work but they're not too bad."}
{"text":"Its incredibly delicious food made with love portions are more than good like grandma trying to feed you good. Kool Aid is always on point."}
{"text":"The chicken here was good, but we had to wait a little while to get it. We were short on time so we ended up taking it through security and eating it on the plane. By that point the fries had absorbed all the steam so they were cold and soggy. I also tried a bite of my boyfriend's waffle and it was also cold and soggy. Not very appetizing. But the chicken tenders were very good."}
{"text":"Soul food in the desert!!!   I've only been to the Scottsdale location, so it's a bit too \"clean\" for my taste, but the food is a real treat.  Good break from the usual Mexican, chinese, pizza, etc.

Fried chicken with Gravy and Onions is my favorite.  Chicken loses some of its crispiness smothered in gravy, but that's a worthwhile trade off.  Sides are either really good or mediocre.  Avoid mac and cheese.  Very disappointing.  Red beans and rice are excellent. Collared greens are the best by far.  Spicy and hearty.  I'm not a big fan of grits, but they were creamy.  Service was a bit slow.  If you're planning on going during spring training, be weary of going after a Giants game as Lolo's is right down the street from the stadium and once the game's over, it gets really crowded and the service slows down more than usual.

Kool-Aid served in jugs?  Does it get any better than that?  I think not!

Red velvet cake is really moist and worth the trip by itself (slight exaggeration).

Price is a bit high, but portions are good and I didn't feel ripped off by any means.

Fun place and comfortable for the kids."}
{"text":"You have the best food and a new location, but unfortunately I can't go due to your parking. Why on earth do you insist on employing a Valet?? Just let me park, thanks."}
{"text":"Food was  ok, I mean how can you mess up fried anything, was there tonight on a slow Monday and the service was terrible.  Seated right away, was rushed to order something, food brought out and NEVER asked again if we needed anything else. Not a do need a refill or even asked if we wanted desert. Had to wait around forever to get a togo box. The waiter, who on the receipt said he was the manager, even brought the bill before we were done. Never going to this place again."}
{"text":"Great service - lots of staff, everyone checks on you including mgnt. Ever get that feeling when you're hungry that you could eat just about anything, but nothing sounds all that appealing?So I ordered the best 3pc. Fried Chicken and Mac & Cheese  I've ever had.  Waffles were pretty good, Lemonade was a little sweet, but terrific and nostalgic. 

FYI ; I was absolutely right. Admittedly, the wait to get inside was pretty long, but this seems to be the norm at the best places in town. Most likely, people are tired of hanging around Applebee's waiting for an overdone steak or chicken. ..."}
{"text":"The food at Lo Lo's is quite good. Fried chicken smothered in gravy will make your heart race. Parking at Scottsdale location is a bit of a challenge but the valet parking guys are pretty good. Front desk staff, particularly a young lady named \"Diamond\" could polish their customer service skills. She was very good about telling me all the things she wouldn't do for my party of 12. Perhaps LoLo's should reevaluate it's greeting staff."}
{"text":"Approaching the hostess stand as I looked around the newly designed space I was quick to find that much like my surroundings the service too at Lo Lo's was far superior to Roscoe's and led by one smiling face at the podium to another at my table towards the back it would not be long before a menu was in hand, water was filled, and a few daily specials were noted - the whole process taking less than five minutes and my order placed within ten, much to my waiter's delight as he noted \"man, you ordered all the best stuff - I hope you brought your appetite.\"

Sitting and watching the games as the restaurant's hustle and bustle continued my neighbors struck up a conversation with me stating that they had been coming to Lo-Lo's \"every few weeks since the day it opened\" and admitting it was my first time they suggested it definitely wouldn't be my last and within moments of the arrival of my meal I knew they were right as every single item that landed on my table looked excellent; the first being a single $3.50 \"Aunt Hattie's Salmon Croquette\" featuring a crispy external batter surrounding flaky salmon and studded with green onions.  Apparently a traditional southern recipe but one I'd not previously encountered I was told that these were best with a splash of Lo-Lo's \"famous\" hot sauce and although I generally prefer to avoid condiments I must say my neighbors were right as the acidity of the sauce really helped to bring out some of the more briny notes from the salmon while breading remained crunchy with minimal grease.

Moving next to my main plate, the $14 Soulfood Platter with Chicken Fried Chicken, a golden waffle, macaroni and cheese, plus a round of cornbread it would be hard to find a gripe with this dish save for, maybe, those who like their mac n' cheese a little over-baked and with a bit of crunch.  Featuing a double dipped and friend boneless, skinless breast alongside a bowl of intense and peppery sausage gravy the chicken here was definitely the star of the show with each bite juicy and full of crunch but largely devoid of any oil whatsoever.  Nicely spiced and with the gravy further gilding the lily I next turned my attention to the waffle, also crisp but intensely buttery with a good amount of 'give' at the center and while pure maple syrup would have been ideal in the end the Mrs. Butterworth's was fine - the sweetness tempered by the chicken, gravy, and macaroni.  Last but not least, the cornbread crowned with a mound of butter was textbook - a little dry, not too sweet, and good both on its own or as a transition between the plate's other components.

Making short work of the Soulfood plate my primary server, Joseph, stopped by to say \"nice job\" and asking if I had room for dessert I think he was surprised when I said yes - and even more surprised when I ordered two; one for here, one to go, and both eliciting a slow whistle from the gentleman to my left who said to his wife \"that boy can eat\" - and much like the savories what I ate next would be outstanding.

Beginning first with the lesser known of Lo-Lo's signature desserts, a house made banana puddin' served in a hefty mason jar and topped with an airy dollop of whipped cream - at $5 this is probably the steal of the menu as the container must have contained twenty spoonful of the rich parfait.  At times rife with the fructose of banana and at times mellowed by whipped cream or saturated Nilla wafers with plenty of textural nuance added by crumbles and chunks of unsoaked cookie this was precisely my kind of dessert; high end ingredients or not, I love pudding.

Realizing I couldn't (or a least shouldn't) leave Lo-Lo's without trying their oft raved \"Sandy Sand's Red Velvet Cake\" and knowing I could (but shouldn't) have eaten it while I was still seated at 10 Yuma Street I asked for a piece to be boxed up and although it wasn't pretty, the results were just as good as many have suggested - the cake moist, dense, and loaded with cocoa while the cream cheese icing is slick but not too sweet and nicely tempered by the pecans.  Generally one to fancy cupcakes over sliced cakes mostly because I prefer there to be more cooked surface area and thus more 'sponge' I was particularly interested to see the open baking window as I left the restaurant where the team was assembling the cakes from large springform pans thus allowing the layers to each have more exposure and thus explaining the excellent texture.  For my money I'd go with the puddin', but this is one damned fine Red Velvet, and in the context of the experience that is Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles either make a great finale to a great meal in an unexpected but excellent setting."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite restaurant in Scottsdale.  Every time I come here the food and the experience is great!  This time I went with a group of people and our server was very nice and she checked on us very often to see if we needed anything.  One member of our group got her food very quickly after she came later than us, which was very good in terms of service.  I ordered the Lil Amadi that came with one drumstick and one thigh of fried chicken along with one waffle.  I also got a side of mac and cheese and a piece of cornbread.  The chicken was juicy and fried to perfection!  That waffle is incredible and you have to get it when you go there!  The mac and cheese and cornbread were both excellent as well!  I would definitely recommend getting the Kool Aid while you're here as well.  The dessert here is amazing too!  Overall great experience!  I will be back again!"}
{"text":"If you have been to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in LA. Well welcome to Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles in Phoenix. The chicken is off the chain,waffles are yummy. The family ate small bowls of Mac and cheese and rice over red beans and cheese grits. It was all good. Can't wait to come back for some more chicken and I want get my hands on some shrimp and grits"}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is great. Music is great. Location is great. Decor is great. I have been to their restaurants many times. I am always treated wonderfully when I go in. It's flattering to have a respectfully flirtatious waiter serving me each time I go in, even though I know they just flirt for tips. I do not know what people are complaining about, the service is always great. I believe in treating others with respect and kindness in order to get served the way you want, so maybe that's why I've never had a bad experience. The owner was in the front of the house tonight, so I felt like I met a celebrity when I told him I love his restaurant. I think it's good that he sees the FOH operations and can manage his staff that way. I think they should open a Tucson location. I am slightly envious of Lo- Lo's business, and I wish he could mentor me."}
{"text":"I love the food, but this new valet service has got to go. Bunch of morons driving everyone's car like a bunch of race car drivers. And, I get told to park way out on the street if I don't want to let them drive my brand new sports car. And they get butt hurt as if I'm insulting their mom. Lolos, GET RID OF THE VALET OR I WONT BE COMING BACK!"}
{"text":"For our Sunday lunch we were in the mood for some Southern cooking and comfort food so we decided to give this place a try.  
We came hungry and left happy!

Location & Aesthetics - located on S Central Ave in Phoenix.  It's a corner restaurant and wasn't difficult to miss with big enough signs.  
The parking lot at the side of the restaurant was on the small side and packed.  Thankfully at the time of our arrival a couple of people were leaving so we got lucky to snag a parking spot.  There's a parking lot across a small street opposite the restaurant which I believe can be used to park as I saw other patrons parking there as well.

The restaurant had plenty of seating both inside, what looked like a back area, and an outside area though there weren't any folks dining outside due to the hot weather but the misters were on.
The restaurant was clean and well lit from light from the outside and inside.  
Noise levels was high with all the dining folks, and I believe there was music playing in the background.  Large screened TV's adorned the walls but were on mute.  The walls also contained paintings and pictures of various musicians and stars.
My suggestion for an arrival time would be early.  We arrived at/around 1-1:30 in the afternoon and there was a wait of about 30 minutes plus the waiting area was packed with only standing room left.
There's only one entry point into the restaurant from the parking lot and that would be on S Central Ave itself.  As you enter, you're greeted by staff then you provide them with your name and how many are in your party.  
If you choose, you can wait around by the door as most people were doing if the one couch they have is occupied or wait outside as I also witnessed folks doing.

Menus - while you wait, you can grab a to-go menu (many copies available) to have a gander of what's on the menu as it was similar to the real one that's provided when you're finally seated.
When you're seated, you're provided with a 4-page colorful, self-explanatory menu that also contained drinks and desserts as well (can't remember if I saw that on the to-go menu).  

Service - All staff, from the folks that greeted us at the front door to our waitress, was super friendly.  
The waitress explained everything and asked if we ever dined there before.  She provided suggestions of the favorite dishes that folks ordered and checked on us periodically throughout our stay.

Food - For me I ordered The Famous Soulfood Platter which came with your 1 choice from eight items plus two sides and it came with a cornbread.  From the 8 items, I chose the 3 pieces of chicken (Southern fried).  You can opt for random pieces or you can pick which ones you want.  For me, I went with the leg, a wing, and breast.  For my 2 sides, I chose the mac n' cheese and the rice with beans.
The wifesky, ordered The Cool Bre Bre's Chicken Salad (field greens, white meat chicken, candied walnuts, cherry tomatoes, avocado, applewood bacon & your choice of ranch, raspberry or balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing) and it was huge!  She almost didn't finish but she managed to push through.
For my meal, first the sides - the mac n' cheese - served in a small bowl but was of a heaping portion and wasn't too dried out and sticky, and wasn't too runny either.  It was done just about right because you can't have mac n' cheese done too runny or too dried out in my opinion.  
The rice with beans was to die for.  My only regret was not ordering another side of it.  The rice was well cooked and fresh plus the beans...not sure if it was red beans because it didn't look like baked beans was done to perfection!  It was well cooked and the sauce/gravy it was served in was nicely seasoned with a small kick to it.
The chicken was moist, tender, succulent, fresh, and cooked perfectly.  It was well seasoned and the fried skin/batter wasn't overwhelming so it had enough bite/crunch to it.  The chicken wasn't too oily/greasy 
It was truly Southern styled, comfort food!

Definitely would love to come back to try those oversized Belgium waffles I was seeing on other folks plates!  You truly won't regret your visit here!"}
{"text":"This would be my sit-down location while the original downtown PHX location would be my pick up when I'm in the area. This joint has yet another YLU sticker & i will say is well deserved because of their great customer service. 

So 3 stars you ask? What do ya want its chicken & waffles!! I'm afraid the hype about Roscoes chicken & Waffles in LA makes chicken & waffles well...a bit overrated. Also, this review isn't a comparison to Roscoes in Cali, this is about once again-C&W. I so wanted to believe in this chicken & waffles hype-i did. The concept is interesting being chicken x waffles contrasts yet blends nicely on the carnivourous palette all the while satisfying our sweet tooth. I did not get that rush of endorphins that kick in when I'm in love with a \"staple dish.\" I LIKE-therefore: 3 stars. It seems the main ingredient being butter & the portions being huge is definitely a recipe for success. Aside from the chicken & waffle dish I ordered \"Stupid fries\" which would be the soul food equivalent to carne asada fries :). All in all I walked out feeling pretty decent.

This place will be a once-in-a-while eatery for me. Definitely a breakfast eatery.  Like I said, 3 stars is A-OK with me."}
{"text":"This review should be read aloud in the voice of my dad, which means a combination of Foghorn Leghorn and Tommy Lee Jones.

Q: do you like fried chicken? 

If you answered \"yes\" proceed to Lo-Lo's. 

If you answered \"no\",  then what in the hell is wrong with you? 

Seriously, go get a chicken leg from anywhere else that sells chicken legs. 

Go on. I'll wait.

Now, look at the chicken leg that you just brought over here to me and compare it to...

THIS BIG-ASS MONSTROUS LEG FROM A REAL CHICKEN THAT THEY ARE GONNA SERVE YOU AT LO-LO's!

Not only is this leg three times bigger than that lil ole scrawny bantam leg you got, but it's ten times as juicy and tastes like the good Lord done blessed whatever chicken it came from with the most delicious chicken genes he could find! 

Chicken so good you'll wanna take the bones home with you and suck on 'em later just to reminisce about how good that chicken was."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to this restaurant as my husband were in the mood for some southern food and we were not disappointed!!! First our server Mike was AMAZING!! So on top of it!! He kept checking in on us and made sure our drinks were topped off. He interacted with my kids which they really enjoyed and was just SOOOO UPBEAT AND FRIENDLY!! Next the food was OFF THE CHAIN!! I wasn't able to eat all of my meal but was not disappointed that I got to bring home left overs, just wish I coulda saved room for their banana puddin!!! But I couldn't stop eating my chicken, grits and Mac n cheese!!   Let's not forget their sweet tea!! I grew up drinking this as a kid and it really reminded me of my moms!!! I ONLY WISH  we had a location where I live in CA!!! But I will for sure be back before we leave and will definitely be trying their banana puddin!!"}
{"text":"The Place is very clean so I will give them that! However the food itself is overpriced. The waffles are nothing special they use the same waffle iron you can buy at Walmart! There not even specialty waffles, just the plain small looking waffles. 

The chicken was dry, and unseasoned. So for $10 bucks I was given dry chicken, and plain waffles. I could have spent half that at the grocery store and gotten better food. 

Waste of time for someone looking for good waffles and protein to complement it. The Mcdonalds Breakfast platter has better food"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I don't go that often since they're usually closed once I'm off work, but when we can go, we do.  The staff is friendly and the place is pretty clean.  

I usually order an Arnold Palmer or a Dr. Pepper, though they've got a lot of different coolaids, sweet teas, etc.  

As for the menu, there's lots of different options in their combinations.  You can go nuts and get two waffles and a bunch of chicken all the way down to one waffle and one leg, etc.  I usually get the \"Tre-Tre\" which is a waffle and two legs, then I'll add a leg.  I keep it simple.  

The waffle shows up and you'd swear it was a Waffle House waffle...until you take a bite.  I don't know what they use, but they add some cinnamon and it really adds to the experience.  The chicken legs are usually large with plenty of meat and the breading tastes great.  On rare occasion do I wish I had more food.

The only negatives in my opinion is that it can take a while to get your food and it's a bit expensive, particularly after you add the tip.  For a drink, a waffle and three pieces of chicken, you'd think it would be cheaper, but it's good and still worth it.  It's always busy, so that helps!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. Being from the south, I know what real soul food tastes like, and this is the commerical version of that. I have the opportunity to sample the chicken wings, mac and cheese, collards and yams. It was just ok. The mac and cheese was bland, the yams were decent. The fried chicken is hit or miss. Once my chicken was finger looking good; but then it tasted reheated.  The place is always packed with a diverse customer base; which is great. I would go back to eat; but its certaintly not a place that I drool over like I do Grandma's Sunday dinner."}
{"text":"I'm a Yankee that's so Yankee he roots for his hometown Yankees.  So take this for what it's worth.

This place has the best fried chicken that I've ever had.  The prices are what they should be.  The waffles are good, and they'll make them crispy if you ask.

I've been in here 5-10 times and they've never gotten anything wrong.  Solid 5 stars.

Also I'm glad they stopped doing the valet.  Valet creeps me out.  I can park a car.  I've done it before."}
{"text":"Hey what can I say? Chicken. Waffles. Grits. This place is pretty good. Service was swell too. Have to hit this up again when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"This is the best place I been to in Phoenix. This was BOMBBBBBBBBB.com. I can't wait to come back tomorrow. The flavor of the food & drinks, wowwwww"}
{"text":"I think Lo-Lo's is a great way to enjoy massive crowds and yummy food. Lots of people can't be wrong. Food is an interesting take on comfort food and soul food. This take is one to at least experience once in a lifetime. Good environment. Friendly servers. Let's keep it up."}
{"text":"This review is about the wait to be seated. Look, I get it; it's Sunday and it's packed, but when people who come in after us get seated before us-is a problem. We are a party of TWO and multiple parties of two we're sat down before us, even though they gave their name after us to the hostess. Things can get mixed up, understandable, but when I ask the hostess why? She gives me the explanation \"their name was on the list first.\" Lies. How does an iPad mess up the order of names? It doesn't. It's been an hour since we've been here and STILL not sat. Ridiculous! I'm fine with waiting, but that's not the issue here.. People being sat before us is."}
{"text":"The two things I love about this place; red velvet cake and koolaide. My praise only echos what has already been said here, I just had to post to show my love."}
{"text":"I've lived in Arizona around 10 years and I never had the opportunity to go to Lo-lo's until recently. After eating here I immediately regretted my decision to wait so long. I'm a HUGE fan now. Their collard greens are wonderful, obviously the chicken rules, generous portions (you can eat like two full meals off one plate), awesome drinks (bloody Mary was savory and salty and just all around good), and the servers are super awesome and helpful. I'm stoked to go back again sometime soon."}
{"text":"The service sucks, the orange juice tasted stale but the food was good. Go at your own risk!"}
{"text":"Great food that really touches the soul. Love the fried chicken with their hot sauce. The waffles are excellent. Must order the fried okra and cheese grits."}
{"text":"This spot is da bomb. I can see why it's a must go to spot. We went on a Sunday and there wasn't much of a long wait since you can check in online, if you go there, I don't think the wait is long either. The service was really good, our waitress was attentive and knew her stuff.

I would highly recommend getting the fried cat fish. It's so damn good, best I've ever had. Also go the famous chicken and waffles, definitely more than enough for one, and it was delicious also. We also had mac cheese side and collard greens, those were ok for me. The food here is pretty solid tho. Definitely would come back if we're in the area again."}
{"text":"If your looking for something different and a place trending and hot ' lo-lo's chicken and waffles is a great place ..upon entry.                   * my foodie tribe of 11' where warmly greeted and seated. After ' the host went over the menu and hot items and drinks . Everyone went with different chicken and waffle options. From the DD' to smothered with gravey and onions to shrimp mac and cheese ..the chicken coating excellent in texture and full of flavor,  the chicken moist and tender and the waffles firm and crispy with and excellent flavor ' a few orders of extra waffles where made to accompany extra chicken ..oh ' and for drinks * kool-aid on tap ..
If your in the area ' even if your not , get to Lo-lo's chicken and waffles , this place is going to change things in the \" chicken and waffle \" battle. Get on board of the champion.."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like it, heard so much about the restaurants. The waffles were limp, not crispy. The chicken breast was pink on the inside, undercooked. The sweet potatoes were so hard they bordered on raw.
NOPE, won't go back. But the Joe's Barbecue next door sure smelled good."}
{"text":"Went to Lo-Lo's Friday morning with my cousin and a friend, there was no wait at all. We ordered the fried green tomatoes appetizer ($7) and all had a plate of chicken and waffles ($8). 
The fried green tomatoes were fresh, hot, crunchy, and tangy, just like I like them! Fried green tomatoes are a southern dish and I live in Atlanta, so I know green tomatoes! The green tomatoes at Lo-Lo's can certainly hold there own up against the ones I've had back home! 
The fried chicken was hot and delicious as well, not the best but tasty. And the waffles were just OK, reminiscent of the waffles at waffle house.
Also the service was great, whenever I'm back on this side, i'll be sure to visit Lo-Lo's again."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Such a great atmosphere and delicious food. I always look forward to going back. 

The chicken and waffles are fantastic, but try some of their other offerings.. The real cheese mac n cheese is amazing, as is the red velvet cake."}
{"text":"We love the food! The chicken was so tender and the waffles were JUST delicious! The banana pudding was just heaven! The service was very nice and kind. This is one of the most delicious places I've ever been to!"}
{"text":"I don't like fried chicken. Definitely not enough to order it at a restaurant. Ever. It isn't that I haven't had a lot of it, but there's nothing that I've really enjoyed about most of what I've had.

That said, Lo-Lo's is, hands down, the best fried chicken I've ever eaten: COMPLETELY crispy skin, flavorful coating and succulent meat. You gotta try it.

At Lo-Lo's, I like mine with waffles, syrup and hot sauce... with a side of buttered grits or mac and cheese... And don't forget a big ol' sweet tea in a giant Mason jar.

The service was spectacular, too -- what more could you ask for? 

Just GO! Now."}
{"text":"Lovin' this LO-LO's! First time at this location and impressed with the atmosphere and service. Our server Aneas was absolutely fantastic, the food was tasty, and we will be back. Thanks LO-LO's in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's is amazing. I'm from Southern California & Lo-Lo's puts Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles to shame. The food, customer service & atmosphere are simply amazing. My favorite restaurant by far, especially this location in Scottsdale. Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"Mostly everybody in Phoenix loves this place. I thought it was very meh. Being born and raised in the Midwest *whispers* (and black) I know what is and what is not good fried chicken. This is decent at best.

So if you have never experienced really good fried chicken before then I can understand why you would love this place. 

Prices are pretty good and the portions are big, service gets the thumbs up.

Worth a try just to say you've ate here before."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to LoLo's. All the food was really delicious except for the dried chicken.  Whoops! I meant fried chicken. No, I meant dried  chicken. The same thing happened the first time. No excuse for it. Two tiny chicken breasts. I asked the waiter if they were wings. Good news, he apologized and brought me two slightly larger bone dry breasts. If sensational Mac and cheese and great corn bread and homemade lemonade are worth 23 dollars (a la  carte menu gets you every time), they should just take the chicken off the menu and just call it LoLo's Very Expensive Mac 'N Cheese Restaurant."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Lo-Lo's and we were not disappointed at all.  Staff were very friendly and the food was amazing - we liked everything we tried!
Prices were reasonable and we would recommend calling in if ever you're in the Old Town Scottsdale area!!"}
{"text":"I was going to eat breakfast in Tuscon but none of the menus really peaked my interest. I figured phoenix isn't too far and on the way so let's go there.  When I saw chicken in waffles I immidiatly set my navigation for it.  It's a pretty good sized restaurant with seating both  and the wait was still about 30 minutes.  I ordered the Baby Ray which consisted of 3 pieces of chicken smothered in a southern gravy and onions with cinnamon waffles on the side.  I can honestly say I've never had better waffles than today.  The chicken was on point as well. Will definitely be back here many times."}
{"text":"Awesome soul food. Best fried chicken in town!!! Not very healthy, but definitely worth a 1-3 visits annually."}
{"text":"The catfish-amazing!! Tender, melts in your mouth. We also had fried chicken, waffles, cornbread & grits. The food was excellent. Waitstaff checked on us a bunch of times because our adult beverage took a while, but they were very friendly & attentive. Absolutely going back!"}
{"text":"After finally tasting Lo-Lo's chicken and waffles together, I thought, \"These waffles are fantastic, and how on earth did I ever eat waffles without chicken before?\" They're topped with a big dollop of creamy butter and a small glass of warm syrup ...maybe 2 to 3 ounces. (I have no idea; it's not like I'm paying attention as I'm pouring it all over.)

If you want a breakfast \"done right,\" served anytime, they've got everything from an \"egg white veggie omelet\" to \"chocolate, caramel, candied walnut french toast\"...everything from eggs, sausage, bacon, oatmeal, amazing biscuits & more to Oreo or Pineapple Upside Down pancakes, etc. You get the idea. 

Some things on the menu are almost too sweet though (in my opinion) like their Red Velvet pancakes with Cream Cheese Icing. It could easily feed two people as a \"dessert.\"

I give the Chicken Fingers and Mac & Cheese two thumbs up. I like the \"Phat Azz Samich\" (chicken) and love the Hood Burger (which should be called a Phat Azz Burger). I've never had their fish, shrimp, or chili, but I would imagine that they probably have those nailed as well.

Grits are something that I think \"you either like or you don't,\" but I think that they are amazing with their huge scoop of butter on them. Add the syrup, and they taste like caramel corn! 

As far as \"Dranks,\" they have everything from Southern, Sugar-Coma Kool-Aid and Sweet Tea (in huge Mason jars) to Mixed drinks, like: Melon Mojitos, Mimosas, Margaritas, Cherry Martinis...and that's just the \"M\" list. I haven't tried them all, haha, but the \"Georgia On My Mind\" is great. Speaking of the bar, it's not a \"hang out at a bar\" kind of area; it's an \"eat out back, under a roof, and enjoy the weather\" area. And they DO have beer, wine, milk, Voss water, FRESH OJ, awesome homemade lemonade, etc., just no Dr. Pepper. What's up with that, Lolo? (They have Pepsi products.) 

The service is pretty fast considering the volume of items made to order, and every server we've had has been super fun, friendly & efficient. Plus, there's so much to check out with the decor. It's a cool place!

It starts getting packed at 7 p.m. most nights, so my advise is to make it there by 6:30, as they do not take reservations, and the parking lot is usually full. I actually know people who have parked in the adjacent hotel's spots."}
{"text":"I lived in LA for 4 years and ate at Roscoe's a lot. Lo-lo's is better by FAR.

Why? One word: gravy. 

The chicken is tender, juicy, and fried to perfection here. Not overly greasy. The waffles? Just perfect waffles with lots of flavor. The grits? Buttery. The Eggs? Tastes like crack when its scrambled with onions. The drinks/kool-aid? Ridiculous size. The gravy?

RIDICULOUS. Getting the gravy on the side is the best decision you'll ever make. Unlike Roscoe's, which pairs regular brown gravy, Lo-lo's pairs some sort of spiced and onioned concoction that reminds me of the drippings gravy you make on Turkey Day. I literally dipped my entire meal (waffles, grits, eggs) in this gravy and still couldn't get enough.

My only grip is that the Lo-lo's in Scottsdale takes amex, but this one doesn't. =(.

But seriously, Lo-lo's....could eat it every day. IN fact, we we're here for one week, and at Lo-lo's twice.

Oh yeah, the Red Velvet cake is RIDICULOUS."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but I really want to go back. Sadly it's a bit of a hike for me. 

I got the Betty Boop and the Stupid Fries. Both were excellent. Be warned that the Stupid Fries look horrible, but they taste amazing so order them and dig in. The drinks are served in mason jars and the whole place feels and looks like you're in someone's home having a great meal. 

Hopefully I can go back soon because it was absolutely worth the drive.

Update: Went back and they've remodeled. Food was still amazing and now the restaurant is also pretty great looking. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"I ad never been to Lo-Lo's before. It was one of the best new experiences I have had. The food, service, music and atmosphere were all great. Definitely would recommend it and I will be returning."}
{"text":"Ugh...why didn't I just check Yelp first? Clearly I'm exhausted and my filter was lowered. In this vulnerable state I found myself wandering over to Lolo's and it's just not good. Very simple, plain, flavorless food. I've had chicken and waffles in about 10 states and never had it this poorly seasoned. The only reason they got two stars is because I appreciate that they cook to order and the collards are decent and the chicken is juicy, but you know what so is water and it pretty much tastes the same. 

Who knows maybe the non-airport version of Lolo's is better"}
{"text":"The vibe here is cool, there's a DJ spinning records on Friday night. The food is more of a mixed bag. I got the chicken & waffles. The chicken was crispy, moist, and flavorful. The waffles were flat, I had to use all the butter and a lot of the syrup to add flavor. The potato salad was tasteless and had a whole bunch of paprika dumped on it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite LoLo's location in Arizona but today was a disappointment. The food and drinks were good but the service was rough. Our waitress was nice and on top of everything but the kitchen was off today. We got there around 11am and had a short 20 minute wait. We got seated and ordered our drinks and food then we waited... and waited... and waited. Our food finally came around 12:30pm and it wasn't nearly as busy as it normally is when we go. We talked to the manager and he apologized for the extra long wait during a slow time and offered us a couple free desserts. On the way out we heard some banging and screaming in the kitchen area so maybe there was a real issue going on today. This is still my favorite location and I will be back but it probably won't be for a while."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Had chicken, waffles, mac n cheese, greens, and cornbread. I'm stuffed. Excellent friendly service!!"}
{"text":"Nothing special, expensive 3-piece chicken dinner $20, OUCH!!!! Atmosphere ok, hole in the wall with limited menu.. 

You gotta be kidding.......I will not go back."}
{"text":"Chicken n waffles are delicious ! Mac n cheese tummy. Finger lickin good ! Great service all around!!"}
{"text":"Love this location! Every LoLos I go to has amazing customer service but this one had an exceptional waitress named Dana! She was so sweet and nice. It's always nice when a waitress gives you advice on the menu and a better way to order so you get the most bang for your buck. She helped me get my order right, on top of our service, and overall just was a good person. I hope to see her next time I come in because she was great!"}
{"text":"I would love to write a review on the food but after our hour + wait to get in, when we were told 40 minutes.  We have now been sitting in our booth for an hour.  My coffee I initially did not get after ordering,  and my second refill took 30 minutes after asking twice.  We have to much time invested into leaving now but... Damn this really is not the way to have people bring in the New Year... Oh and the hostess was extremely sarcastic and rude when we asked how much longer after an hour had passed.  Great now an espn camera crew is in the kitchen .. Wonder if they are eating my food... Forget breakfast, I should have ordered dinner..... Still waiting and I even finished writing this review.... 1 hope 15 min in and still waiting on food..."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last week and had a great experience. The restaurant was very clean, the service was great. The best part? The food. I've been in AZ for 10 years now and I can say without a doubt that its some of the best food I've had in a restaurant (and this from a pregnant woman no less ;)

I had the fried chicken tenders, cheesy grits and fried okra. First, the food came out piping hot, I mean steaming and hot to the touch. The batter on the chicken was thick and crispy. The grits were cooked to perfection- dry enough to hold together a bit but still moist. And the okra was fantastic, too. It didn't hurt that my fresh lemonade came in a mason jar, either. 

I will be back. a lot :)"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch!  They keep the menu simple, and the items they make are each the best of their kind.  Get their staples - Chicken and Waffles, and make sure to wash it down with a glass of their sweet tea.

Also, plan on an afternoon nap if you can..."}
{"text":"Either Lolos you choose, you're going to end up with some of the best fried chicken in town and some pretty damn amazing waffles too. Service is quick. Waffles are insane. Portions are huge. Chicken is great. Cheese-eggs are a godsend. And the Kool-Aid is entirely opaque. Terrifyingly so. Likewise, avoid the Sweet Tea if you're diabetic, or ask them to cut it half-n-half with the regular tea because DAMN is it sweet.

If you're in the Phoenix location, you may have this sneaking suspicion that you'll come out to find your car up on blocks, but I've never had any trouble and if it's that much of a concern to you, the Scottsdale location is all nice and pretty.

Four stars only because the chicken has been a bit skin/batter-heavy and in a way that hasn't been amazing the last couple of times I've gone. When all's said and done though, you can't beat the combo. 

Do yourself a huge favor and order less than your starving self thinks you need. The waffles will fill you up quicker than you can imagine and the syrup (while not of the Maple variety) just tacks it on. 

Nice folks, great food, fun times."}
{"text":"It pains me to have to give them one star, this place was amazing, WAS. It has been a steady decline for quite some time now, until today, which has made me write them off entirely. They now refuse to take a cash order over the phone (mind you we are in an office ordering for a dozen people all who have cash). Their customer treatment is very poor and at times downright aggressive. The parking lot is valet only so you are forced to park somewhere in the neighborhood behind the building and walk or pay up. I would strongly recommend to pass them by if you are in the area and support the new Welcome Chicken and Donut that is right down the street. You will pay just about the same, the quality of food will be better and the treatment you receive will be a world apart from the sad franchise Lolo's has now become."}
{"text":"We saw a review on CheckPlease on TV and today we were near downtown Phoenix and wanted to try this place.

Our expectations were exceeded!

The food was delicious and the service excellent!

We had the waffles and chicken. Still trying to figure out where the waffles and chicken combination comes from. But mmmmmm good!

Delicious food and excellent service!"}
{"text":"I wish we had more people with us so that there was a reason to order everything on the menu.  My coworker called me up and said let's go to lunch.  She asked me what I was in the mood for and said I hadn't been able to stop thinking about chicken and waffles for the last week.  She said she'd been craving chicken and waffles all morning.  This is why we're friends and not just coworkers.  So we met halfway at Lo-Lo's.
F-N-A-Cotton!  The nicest people ever are working here. I just wanted to skip the rest of work and just hang out all day and chat with the employees, make room for red velvet cake, and drink sweet tea.  Next time....
You must get the stupid fries.  You can share these ooooooorrrrr eat them as a meal if you don't feel like waffles.  Fries, peppers, chicken, cheese, and gravy.  There may be more things included, but it really doesn't matter because they were bomb and that's all you need to know.
Mac and Cheese = BOMB
Chicken and Waffles.... Really?  You need me to review this?  Amazing!! If you've never had chicken and waffles before, you have no idea what you're missing.  It's like heaven on my tongue.  Sweet sweet juicy fried chicken and waffle heaven.
I can't wait until I save room to try the red velvet cake!!!"}
{"text":"I visited here often when I use to work downtown. It was really good food and it made me love the sweet and salty taste of chicken and waffles. Can't skip having a jar of drank. I haven't tried the desert here but based on reviews I must give it a go. Love their fried okra!"}
{"text":"Talk about an upgrade!  The new location is amazing and wide open.  Great outdoor patio and of course, great chicken.  Great job Lo-Lo's!"}
{"text":"Hit Lo-Lo's again recently and it did not disappoint.

I definitely think this is the best fried chicken that I've ever had. Also quite enjoy the excellent waffles with it. While I'd heard of the pairing, I'd never tried it prior to going to Lo-Lo's. Just works for me. 

I also ended up with 3 mason jars of Kool-Aid, which I love. As the Mrs. and her visiting friend are from Australia, they are not familiar with Kool-Aid. When it came out they said \"red cordial\"! Me not being familiar with this red cordial didn't know what that meant. I guess in Australia red cordial has a bad rep for inducing hyperactivity. Of course there is the sugar but then they also think the red food coloring contributes. Since we really did not need our 4 year old and 2 year old more hyper, I ended up with theirs as well. Fine with me. I will admit that I did not finish all 3. Those mason jars are huge!

The rest of the group, kids included, also love their meal.

Among us we had several different pieces of chicken (breast, thigh, wing), waffles, grits, collard greens and mac & cheese. Pretty much everything was a hit. The ladies absolutely loved the collard greens and we put away about 3 orders among the 5 of us. The mac & cheese (a JW recommendation) was also a very big hit. We also modified our grits order to no butter (not sure if that is sacrilege) and while I don't know if my mouth enjoyed it quite as much, I didn't feel like I was going to die from richness as I'd felt after the previous visit.

The staff was super nice as always and we also love the atmosphere in there. Especially liked seeing the Shaq signature on the ceiling in the room with the counter.

Ready to go back!"}
{"text":"All around bad, and we love the stand alone locations. Girl at the register was rude, not helpful, and not interested in moving fast at all. Order took way too long to come out, pretty sure they forgot about it as the 3 orders behind us came out first.  Love the restaurant locations, but won't be stopping here again. Cryin' shame..."}
{"text":"Literally can't say enough good things about Lo-Lo's. My friend knows that whenever I visit him in Phoenix we have to go to Lo-Lo's at least twice! I typically get the \"Lil Amadi\" - a waffle with two chicken thighs or a drumstick and thigh. There's a good amount of cinnamon in the waffle batter but it's not overpowering. The chicken is always, always crispy and juicy and the iced tea hits the spot without being too sweet. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"It's just great for what it is. Best Fried Chicken I've ever had and best waffles. It's really bad for you but sooo good!  My advice as I've gone to both locations a few times, try something different each time.

I've gone there with our Scooter Club (yes, Vespa Scooters), and they are always very very friendly to us. Its wonderful to get such great service from such a busy and moderately priced restaurant!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. We had to flag a waiter to take our order because the waiter that took our drink order never came back. 

Ranch dressing we requested from manager came at the end of the meal. 

They had better service in the old location. One star is generous."}
{"text":"What a joke ! I have never had such flavorless dry chicken and waffles before. I don't even know how its possible to not season chicken and how waffles could turn out tasting as delicious as paper napkins. Could only eat half of our order and threw most of it out. This place has a long ways to go, yikes."}
{"text":"A few girlfriends and I came here on a Saturday for brunch.

I ordered the Biscuits and gravy. It came with two eggs and potatoes. I ordered one side of a chicken thigh. 

The gravy has a mild spice to it and the meal really fills you up!

The prices are a bit much for what is it. It was $20 including tip for brunch."}
{"text":"The service was extremely slow. The food is nothing special put the emphasis on nothing. Food is over priced for the size of serving. Waited 20 minutes for our beverages. Over an hour before we got our food. I would not recommend this for a Saturday or Sunday breakfast or if you are with a party larger than four. 

The quality of food was eh. The chicken tenders were nothing special and the Waffles were Ho hum. 

Atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about this place, but the recent yelp review made me second guess about it. 

Firstly, PARKING IS HORRIBLE. They have \"complementary valet\" parking because there is not self parking nearby. You are suppose to park around the other side of the street or hotel (honestly I'm still not too sure, we just parked on the far side of the hotel) if you want to self park and save yourself the couple bucks. I've been to restaurants where theres pretty much valet only, but the Valet boys were so unclear as to where we were able to park if we wanted to self park without getting towed.

Inside was busy on Saturday bunch. We ended to sitting at a table in the bar area which is honestly just as good at sitting at a regular table. Our server was fast, kinda, cheerful, and very helpful. Minor mess up, but nothing I would get upset over. 

We ordered:
- Red Velvet Pancakes: huge red stacks drizzed with creamcheese frosting. SO filling. 
- Lil C: ordered 1 thigh and 1 wing (but got 2 thighs) with mac and cheese. The fried chicken was good, but i wish it had a little more taste to it. The mac and cheese on the other hand was BOMB. So cheesy and rich. Its thick, so it can get a little dry
- Waffle: thin, soggy waffle :( I wish it was crispy but it had a nice taste
-Lemonade: YUM! supposedly its homemade and i recommend it!
-Koolaid: YES, KOOLAID. Throw back to your childhood and sip on your favorite flavor/color in a huge mason jar. 

Price is a little bit on the pricier side since its just chicken and waffles/brunch, but the amount that they give you can justify it. We went home full and with to-go boxes 

Environment: 3/5  ( because of parking)
Food: 3/5
Price: 3.5/5
Service: 5/5"}
{"text":"i love LO Lo's Chicken& waffles  me and my Boss went there and i had best down home southern fried Chicken since i was a kid  some time this year before the year end i'm going back and taking some friends."}
{"text":"Love Lo-Lo's! The chicken and waffle combo is delicious. The mac and cheese is just average to me- nothing extraordinary about it and not worth $4. I like the kool-aid and the sweet tea- both very sweet and cavity inducing. The waffles have an awesome buttery taste and the chicken is perfectly fried. Took off a star because parking is horrible and there is always a long wait to be seated."}
{"text":"YES! Valet, not a long wait, spacious open floor plan, upgraded decor, mason jar lights, BAR, TV's, alcohol and great food!!! YES and YES! LOLO's you just keep getting better and better!!!"}
{"text":"Was very unimpressed with this restaurant we waited 1hr 30 minutes to eat. A total of 2hrs From start to end. Waitress took for ever to get our drinks and meal orders.we drove from Cali and was told this place was better than roscoe chicken and waffle. Sadly I think this worse. The fried gizzards had no seasoning complained twice to the manager and to the waitress manager said he would look into it which took him 30 minutes to give me the same thing. Then the waitress said the side of spinach is really good.
.that was horrible bland no seasoning. Then I requested for a side of rice and beans all I got was beans lol baked beans. Waitress was like well I can bring a side of rice. I'm not sure but I thought this place was suppose to be a southern mamas cooking. They kept forgetting our refills and the waitress forgot one of my kid pancake poor kid didn't get it till 15 minutes before we were done. We complained but manager excused was oh it new years day. No apology.  I seriously didn't want to give it a star. This establishment was not Well managed."}
{"text":"Sure the neighbor is a little rough, and I might worry about where I park my car.  Also, the food here isn't completely healthy for you, and might be a days worth of calories in one meal.... but it's totally worth it.

This is one of those places that I go to once a year, to pig out on fantastic soul food.  I always order the standard friend chicken with waffles, mac and cheese and collard greens.  The sides are kinda pricey, but good to share with someone.  Even though they look small, you'll be so full from the actual meal, it wouldn't matter.

Good mix, hot sauce with the maple syrup and the chicken, you gotta try it.

The place is small, but it has a nice atmosphere, with books and magazines scattered around to read while you wait.  It's a cozy place, great for a nice outing out with a friend."}
{"text":"It was ok! I like Roscoe's chicken and waffle better in California! Took too long for a party of 8"}
{"text":"Food was very delicious places clean. services excellent it was a little loud  you can with it will be back in the future  play good old school  music love this place."}
{"text":"Terribly slow service. 15 min for a sandwich and nobody else was in front of me. This is an airport, yet the restaurant has faster service. This is the 2nd time, and last time!"}
{"text":"There is no doubt your chicken and waflle combo is good and when you serve good food, expect your customers to recommend your resto to our friends. And, when I say FRIENDS... that means A LOT! Like a party of 20. Last October 25th, our party of 20 arrived around 2030 to have a late dinner, we really didnt expect to be seated right away since our group was huge. We waited around 20-25 mins which wasnt too bad since the place was busy that night. Then came our server... my friends told him right away that we would be paying separately (5 tabs for 5 families) so he wouldnt be too confused with taking our orders and billing us. Instead, he brushed us off and insisted to remain on our seats and get our orders ONE BY ONE. We questioned this method since we had our young kids with us and we prefer that we order for them and we tend to share our platter among us. My husband and I didnt like his tone, it was like he was talking down on us, he kept on saying, \"Listen up, listen up!\" as if we were his subordinates. We waited another 20 mins for our drinks and once we got our drinks, another 20 mins for them to get our orders. That our kids have finished their drinks even before they got our food order. When the food came out, there was even more chaos because no one could really remember who ordered what probably because we were all too hungry! While eating, what did our beloved server do? Of course, he had to ask us once again who ordered what and under whose tab since he didnt take our suggestion in the first place!

I am not really questioning the quality of your food, just the system you have when you are faced with a large group of customers. Hopefully, by the time you open in Gilbert (where we live), you have ironed out your system already. Love the new place, btw, very modern. Although the old place was more home-y. 

We are giving you another chance, Lo-lo's!!!"}
{"text":"This place has a much better set up than the former location. It feels like an actual restaurant with a bar and some TVs. Next time, I'll try something other than chicken and waffles. If you do get the chicken and waffles, always get a side of honey hot sauce. Yum!"}
{"text":"I am a fan however the service isn't. I understand this establishment gets busy however waiting for my drink for over an hour and our food- Thank you Jesus their food makes up for it! Love their Grits and shrimp and their chicken. Waffles are great however I like my waffles much more crispy"}
{"text":"If you like great fried chicken or catfish, run, don't walk to Lo-Lo's. The fried chicken is the best in Phoenix. Throw in a waffle - yes it's amazing - and a side of beans on rice, greens, mac and cheese and yams and you'll be set for the day, and left-overs tomorrow. The neighborhood is a bit rough around the edges, but that adds to the adventure. And there's one in Scottsdale just north of SkySong on Scottsdale Road. This is one of our favorite places to go in Phoenix. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The locals raved about this place so my co-workers and I came here before our flight. 

There was a long line and they told us it would be a 20 minute wait...however it turned into an hr wait. 

I got the sweet tea (decent) and drumsticks over mac and cheese with a side of onions and mushrooms. 

The sweet tea was pretty authentic and came in a huge mason car for $3.50. 

We ordered our food around 1pm and it came out almost an hour later.....
The place was busy but the food probably should not have taken an hour to come out. I think something was wrong with their fryer. The manager came out after an hour after we kept asked where our food was. She apologized and brought out the food around 15 min later. They also mixed up one of the orders and gave the girl the completely wrong order. My co -worker who ordered the catfish platter only got one of the meats he ordered because the fryer was broken. I think it was just bad news bear overall. They gave us free banana bread pudding at the end but it wasn't really consolation for what happened. 

The drumsticks were pretty dry - popeyes is def better. I would give the mac and cheese 5 stars- def tasted homemade and I really enjoyed it but otherwise the food was just average.

Service was friendly but the food took way too long to come out and the whole food mix-up was def a turn off."}
{"text":"I have such a love/hate thing going on when I eat at Lo-Lo's. I love eating there then I immediately hate myself for doing it. The waffles slathered in butter are so damn good with my drumstick coated in hot sauce. Man, I could really go for some this weekend. Too bad I'm out of town :-/ To top it off, it's only $20 for two people!"}
{"text":"Soul food without the soul. Waffles were microwaved. Chicken was too. Flavorless. Great service from our waiter. Collared Greens were hopeless"}
{"text":"I love this place but hate thier hostesses. The stupid rule about seating complete parties is taken too far. I tried to explain that we might have a 3rd person show up but was unsure if they could make it. I had to either choose a table for 2 and if the other showed up they could not join us or get a table for 3 and wait for that person."}
{"text":"Yum, this was exciting, the place wasn't open yet, and people were lining up, when they opened the doors, I think we were the fourth table to be seated, but by the time we left, it was standing room only!

W both got \"KK\" which was three pieces of chicken, 2 waffles, eggs and grits.  I had tried chicken and waffles before in LA, so I had some idea of what it would taste like together.  I enjoyed it for sure, but it's just fried chicken with some breakfast stuff mixed in, so I don't know why everyone is so  excited for it.  

The service was good, the place was clean and the food was cooked well.  For repeat business from me, I'd go back but only with someone new to the experience."}
{"text":"My mom moved to downtown Phoenix a few months ago and has been ranting and raving about this restaurant since her big move, so I was really excited to try things out. I'm happy to say Lo-Lo's did not disappoint! Our server, Deon, was not only extremely hospitable, but also treated me and my mom to this off-menu Hennessy punch which was truly sensational. I got the three-piece chicken with Mac and cheese, collards, and cornbread. The portions were huge and I ended up with tons of leftovers (didn't even get to the cornbread), but I wish I would've gotten the smothered chicken (my mom got the chicken fried chicken with the brown gravy, which I tried and was blown away by.) Even when it came to tipping the valet, Deon was extremely helpful in exchanging cash for us upon paying the bill.

In spite of my tiny bit of brown gravy FOMO, I would highly recommend this restaurant for a good dose of soul food!"}
{"text":"I love Lo Los but today's visit was bad :(. It took forever to get our food and once we did the Mac and cheese was thick and tasted like burnt cheese. My waffle was a different brown than everyone else's. No ones food came out like expected and the service just wasn't what is usually is. I won't be coming back to the central location any time soon. My visit to Lo Lo's in Vegas and Scottsdale was a totally different and great experience."}
{"text":"Favorite soul food restaurant. Worth every penny. Very ideal for family meals, lively setting, and very welcoming to all."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite place to eat at any time of day. Amazing service, kind staff and great food. Can't get any better than rhat"}
{"text":"This is a chicken and waffles place with valet parking.  The utter pretentiousness would normally have turned me around, but chicken and waffles was on my bucket list,so I persevered.  

I sat at the bar, and the bartender was friendly enough.  They have nice fruit juices.  I ordered the plate with everything, chicken, waffles, eggs, and grits.  The grits and eggs were well-prepared, the waffles are served with hot syrup, but the chicken isn't very good.  It tasted old, like it had been sitting around for awhile.  Check the bucket list, no reason to go back here.

BTW, if you still want to go, and you, too, are put off the pomposity of valet at the soul food place, you can park your own car twenty feet from the door, but I'd skip Lo-Lo's"}
{"text":"Super excited to bring my friends after talking up LoLo's.... we ordered, waited over an hour, and our food never came. Restaurant wasn't extremely busy. Server brought drinks and never checked in on us for over an hour. After waiting for over an hour, we didn't even get an apology. We paid for our drinks and left. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"Love this place. I have only been here one time and it is awesome. The chicken had a little bit too much fat under the friend skin but that was beside me. The waffle was amaaaazing it had almost like a cinnamon-y taste to it. The waffle had a huge glob of butter on it which was not too pleasing to me since I am not a huge fan of butter but taking it off and putting it to the side of my plate was no problem at all. The kool-aid in the mason jars are super cute and unique and I definitely want to go back to try all of the other kool-aid flavors."}
{"text":"Love the food ,service and location. Had lil' sis omlet.... Amazing, mom had waffles and eggs. Nothing exotic but served hot and fresh. Great coffee too. The parking situation is tough but the food and service is worth it"}
{"text":"After visiting Roscoe's again I standby my conclusion that Lo-Lo's has better waffles. Roscoes, still wins on chicken in my opinion though."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was the best! The staff were fun and helpful.  They brought out 1/2 the food and about 5 min. later they brought out the rest.  But boy was it worth it! The fat azz samich was just too good!! The Mac and cheese was great too. Although the chicken and waffles were a little plain. Call ahead so you don't have to wait too long for a seat."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try the lo lo's at the airport! Having been to both locations in Phoenix I know how good their food is! There was 1 person in front of us when we ordered, and we got Yo mama(biscuits and gravy with an egg and potatoes) and a lil jay(a waffle, egg, and meat) and it came out to 35$$$ after drinks. Which was a lot but I thought it would be worth it. Just those took over 30 MINUTES! No other orders besides ours and the one in front of us came out. When we did finally get our food the biscuits were rock hard and both eggs were barely warm and extremely oily. I asked for a waffle as a replacement immediately after trying the biscuits and was told I would have it in 3 min. Another 10 min later it was still not ready and we had to catch our flight so I asked for some kind of compensation and they told me I could not have any kind of refund but I could have 2 containers of gummy bears. By far the worst service I have ever had and I will definitely be taking my business elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"Delicious juicy chicken, so-so waffle, expected it to be crispy and it was soggy. Service was swift and efficient by Andrea. Somewhat expensive for what it is. Lemonade was very good...no coffee service at the bar.

Wait was about 15-20 minutes considering the dining room and parking lot were full. Overall a good experience but can't quite say that I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! I always have work and friend meetings here. Get the banana pudding as an appetizer!"}
{"text":"After moving to AZ,  I noticed Lo-Lo's when I would drive around, so one night a friend and I decided to check it out, and we ended up loving our experience there. We arrived for dinner, and we were immediately greeted by a super friendly and chill waiter named AJ. He told us what people usually order and even if a dish would be too big to consume in one sitting.

My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and I ordered biscuits and gravy, potatoes, and eggs. The pieces of chicken were super crunchy. The biscuits were ginormous - I think one is the size of my fist. Lo-Lo's also has kool-aid on tap, which is amazing. I hadn't drank kool-aid since I was maybe in elementary school and consequently had forgotten how deliciously sweet and addicting it is.

The portions are huge for the money you pay, the decor is fun and bright and clean, and the service is great. I am definitely coming back. very soon."}
{"text":"i was here about 2 months ago, and i still haven't been able to get their chicken and waffles out of my mind...the chicken is fried to perfection, crispy, unctuous and juicy! the waffle is lightly sweet and perfectly fluffy...i can only just imagine how good one would be right now, in front of me...i can't believe i forgot to review this place. also, i was born and raised in los angeles, home to the most famous chicken and waffles place on earth..this place is better than that place. as much as it pains me to say it, its true. the chicken here is better than the one in la..."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is very nice and well executed not overly greasy or over battered and cooked perfectly. The waffles are not bad but not impressive. $8 for a couple of wings and a tasty flour frisbee, not bad overall. 

Service was efficient and friendly. The hostesses were not the friendliest or welcoming I have ever experienced, but hey they got us  to a table. 

If management reads these reviews, just mentioning that the hostess staff is the first interaction your customers have with your business. 

That brings my only criticism, what does one have to do to get a second cup of coffee or a water refill when your server is tasked with a large group and busy?

Having host staff  pouring water or coffee on the floor when there are two on-duty vs. allowing them to herd and sing to the PA music at the front desk might present additional up-sell opportunities for your business. 

We were going to order another breast but we could not get more coffee or water much less food. But a second cup of coffee and a water refill would have been welcome.

To clarify, the place was not slammed busy, only our server was busy.

Anyway, overall good place, actively recommend."}
{"text":"Now I know that most folks who live here have either never heard of this combination or thought of it as some racist stereotype but Lo Lo's serves up the best fried chicken in AZ along with a side of waffles and a cup of syrup like you've never tasted before. The menu is a bit limited in scope featuring dozens of iterations of their featured foods Lo Lo's delivers multiple southern-style sides like grits, rice and gravy, fried okra, collard greens, red beans and rice, fries, mac & cheese, and eggs. Make no mistake, one could easily fill up on side dishes.

You'll find Lo Lo's (if you're lucky) in the SoJack (I'm inventing terms here for the area south of Jackson) off Central. It is a small house-looking structure with a gated door on it. Inside you will find cramped confines that will have the loud and lively wait staff running around you with dishes and cups no matter where you sit. Don't expect quiet, you won't find it. Don't expect privacy, you left that at home. Come and enjoy the people and the food. It is worth the trip and for the experience. We are lucky to have a place like this. The Southern Kitchen in Tacoma was one of the few authentic Southern food places that I have found outside of the south. To have Lo Lo's bringing some culture to AZ is much appreciated. You will not find this kind of food elsewhere in Phoenix."}

HUGE MUG of coffee! 
I was extremely pleased with our meal and I am stuffed! 
It doesn't hurt that I LOVE southern food, being that I am a born and bred Alabama girl! 
War Eagle and Eat at Lo-Lo's!!!
You will be dying for more grits, waffles, and chicken, every time you are near your favorite location!"}
{"text":"Before stepping foot inside the Scottsdale location, I needed to do it proper at the classic phoenix location. It's on the wrong side of the tracks and the clientele feels sketchy. But the staff is friendly and efficient. 

On a Sunday afternoon, the wait wasnt too long for a packed restaurant. I kept it simple with just a chicken breast and single waffle. Both of which were fantastic and are more than arguably better that the well known Roscoe's. The chicken is juicy, mildly spicy, crispy and flavorful. I prefer a bit more spice and their hot sauce does the job nicely. 

They offer kool aid which is cool, but im not a fan of super sweet drinks So i had a lemonade, lol yeah, thats super sweet as well. Overall a good experience & im looking forward to trying out the scottsdale location."}
{"text":"This review is for takeout order only as I did not dine in:

I had zero expectations for Lolo's and it had nothing to do with the restaurant itself but the restaurant atmosphere in Scottsdale. Lots of marginally good food at OKAY prices. 

I live in N Scottsdale so going to Lolo's has to be a planned event especially since they close at 9pm on a Saturday night. I perused to online menu and decided on a Betty Boop and a slice of Red Velvet cake. I sashayed in. Couple of families and couples, some guys sitting at the counter. The hostes was pleasant asked me if I was dining in or getting take out. I told her takeout she handed me a menu and directed me to the counter to place my order. The young lady was nice. I ordered and saddled up to the bar and waited for my food.

The patrons were quiet and the plates I saw were clean. this a good sign, it means people were too busy stuffing their faces to engage in idle chatter. 

I probably waited about 6 minutes. They called my name I grabbed my food and headed back up the road.

I knew I was not eating my meal right away and had to stop at the store first do by the time I got home the food was cool. I threw the chicken and waffle in the oven to reheat for a few minutes.

The waffle darkened up a little but didn't dry out neither did the chicken breast. 

I de-boned the chicken took off the skin that wasn't crispy(I don't eat chicken skin unless it is cooked to a point where I can't tell that it is chicken skin) Added my condiments and went to town. It was a solid meal. 

I'd go back to Lolo's again if I were in the area. I probably wouldn't make a special trip from home again, but I had to give the place a try. 

Oh and the Red Velvet cake was good. Not fabulous but good."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix....first time at Lo Lo's! Loved it! Service was great....Leslie our server was fabulous. The Soul food platter is EVERYTHING! I'm actually on a diet and could only eat the collard greens but the 3 other people at my table all ordered the platter and loved it! The mac & cheese is super cheesy....and the cornbread muffin...oh, Lord, the cornbread muffin!! We have been here for alittle over 6 minutes and all the chicken....6 pieces in total is ALL GONE.....just bones!

I will be returning on my cheat day!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Lo-Lo's on Scottsdale Road. The food is good, the serving sizes are huge. I had left-overs for my next day lunch. The atmosphere is great and the staff is friendly. You won't be dissappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing great things about this place for ever.  I was expecting my tastebuds to explode or some type of salivary glee!?!  I ordered the special, \"Fried chicken on a waffle\" and it was very under whelming! The chicken was marginal and the waffle was a plain ol' bland cold waffle and the sweet tea was way too sweet I had to ask them to 50/50 my tea into half water half tea.  However, the line was long, no where to park and the place was poppin so it could just me me. *Maybe....I just set my own expectations too high."}
{"text":"What's all the hype about?

Yes, the fried chicken was good, but, the good ends there! The service was slow and they not only messed up our order but also came back twice with food we never ordered to confirm that we, in fact, did not order that!

The tables are so tightly packed that we had to keep moving our chairs each time they had to serve other customers around us, which was practically ever 120 seconds! We asked for a couple of more plates since we were sharing, and, never got them until we reminded them three times. 

Also, the waffles that come with the chicken were so Eggo. 

Would I go back? MAY be; if I am really in the mood for their fried chicken and gather enough patience to deal with everything else that comes with it."}
{"text":"LoLo's catered an event at our church for about 200.  It was a huge success--the food was out of this world!! The quality, the presentation, the unique and delicious taste--perfect!

Their waffles are the Spinkles cupcake version of waffles--delicious and dense--never had a better waffle in my life. The chicken was out of this world--and we are from the deep south!  The rice and beans were a gourmet take on a favorite--addictive! The Collard greens has a nice spicy bite to them that made us go back for seconds. OH! The CORNBREAD!!  TO DIE FOR!    Everything was excellent--hot, served with such love and professionalism--the staff was AMAZING!!  We fell in love with these terrific gentlemen--kind, passionate about their food and so very hospitable!  One of the best catered events I have ever attended!!!"}
{"text":"Went there and it wasn't super busy. We waited 45 minutes for our food. Horrible . Especially when people who showed up after us with a larger party were served before us. I love going here for the food but not sure if I will return. That wait was ridiculous . My kids were starving as was I."}
{"text":"After a second visit, the chicken was a little dry and lacked flavor. Quite a contrast to my first visit. Still enjoyed the meal, but wasn't as impressed with the chicken. I'll have to go back to see if it was a fluke."}
{"text":"Dropped off early at the airport. What to do? Lo-Lo's or Matt's? Lo-Lo's or Matt's? I'm a big fan of both restaurants, but have tried neither airport location as of yet. Sometimes proximity to an escalator is all it takes to sway me. Lo-Lo's it is!

I was a bit concerned by previous reviews. Harsh! My reaction to this spot? It's not S. Phoenix. It's not Scottsdale. It's Sky Harbor Airport. If you reduce your expectations accordingly, it's not bad. The staff was very friendly. The Lil Jay, eggs and waffle for six bucks, is not a bad deal for an airport. The cheesy scrambled eggs were great. The waffle suffered from being crammed into a styrofoam container, but was recognizable as Lo-Lo's. 

I'm curious to see how they handle the chicken here, so I'll back. Next morning airport visit? Have to check out Matt's.

It's difficult to recreate a local restaurant experience in an airport, especially one as unique as the S. Phoenix Lo-Lo's. Abbreviated menu. Portable delivery. No individualized seating area. Lo-Lo's is still working on it, but they're headed the right direction and I suspect they will eventually get it right."}
{"text":"There is no better way to start off your day then Fried Chicken and Waffles.  It just puts you on a cloud for the rest of the day.  

Lo-Lo's has amazing fried Chicken the same as Mrs. Whites Golden Rule Cafe which I think is the best in the valley and then Lo-Lo's serves it up with golden brown sweet waffles and syrup.  I know most of y'all won't mess with the mixture of hot sauce and syrup but once you let down your guard you will see how well they go together.  

If I could I would eat here everyday but then I would be about 400lbs and surely not live too long."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Great waffles, excellent chicken and the best Red Velvet Cake EVER!  Our server, Shanae, was superb, but the whole team was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! We got the chicken and waffles and it was fresh and delicious. The coffee was actually really good as well. Our waiter always made sure to check on us even when the restaurant was packed - we go there just before the brunch rush. We'll definitely go again the next time we're in AZ!"}
{"text":"food is very good here along with a very friendly staff and clean environment. chicken is good and the waffles are awesome and dont even get me started about how delicious the mac and cheese is.. you have to try it when you go. You get koolaid in a mason jar and the food is a really good portion as well. we tired the banana pudding which is also very good, they had other homemade desserts like velvet cake. I def recommend trying this place, the menu is put together well and is very clever. Cool names for all the entrees, you wont regret giving lolos a try...and good thing about food like this its good for breakfast, lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location in a very long time, and when I did today. I came to a brand new restaurant. Everything changed, idk how I feel about it. Its in the hood ghetto area, then all of a sudden you walk in, its like the location in Scottsdale.  Eehhhh. I like the old restaurant layout better.. and whatttttt? Valet parking? Yesss they did. They upgrade it.

Best customer service.  They constantly refilled my drink,  so I was never parched :)))

I was bummed that my waffles was soft and crispy. . 
:/ my mac and cheese was delish!"}
{"text":"Another father's day, another breakfast at Lolo's.  The fried chicken should be illegal.  Of course, I only got two bites before my daughter, who previously said \"I'm full\", stole my piece.  Darn kids.  

Oh yeah, great lemonade, grits and waffles.  Love the staff.  But that chicken...."}
{"text":"First time at this location, we always dine in at the downtown Lolo's.  Friendly staff, clean restaurant, and food came out in a timely manner. A little disappointed with the food though. Everything was bland/no seasoning, grits, eggs, and collard greens :("}
{"text":"\"Everybody Want A Piece of My Chicken
Southern Fried Chicken
Finger Lickin' \"-- Ms Peachez 

These are the words that ring in my head every time I know I'm going to get some Fried Chicken & Waffles(C&W); for those who don't know what I'm talking about, do me a favor and search YouTube for: \"Ms Peachez\". Go ahead, I'll wait... Pretty funny, eh? Anyways, I'm always down to grub on some C&W and after seeing the solid reviews for Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles (LLCW) I knew I had to make a stop here on my tour de Arizona. Fortunately, their Scottsdale location is less than 1-mile from Scottsdale Stadium and I leapt at the opportunity.

Sides:

Cornbread- This is a pretty tasty Northen-style Cornbread and for only $1/each you can't beat that deal with a stick! One of my dining companions loved it so much he ordered one for the road! 4*

Entrées:

#8 DD: x2 Fried Chicken Breasts and Waffle- The chicken coating was crispy and tasty, but the chicken itself was a bit dried-out. The Waffle was nice and crisp but I would've preferred it to be thicker--however the taste was very good. Overall, not as good as Lillie Mae's back in San José but it hit the spot. 3*-Chicken/4*-Waffle

Puffs Chicken Tender Basket- I was a bit disappointed to see that LLCW doesn't have a children's menu; so, I had to order my 3-year-old an adult meal, which is OK -I suppose- who doesn't love leftovers? This came with 3 Chicken Tenders and Fries and he gobbled it up pretty well. 4*-Lance Rating

Drinks- All you have to know is they have Kool-Aid, and they serve the Purple flavor (aka Ghetto Grape). 'Nuff said. 5*

Service & Ambiance- Service from our waiter, Carl, was terrific! He was super-friendly, helpful and on top of things. LLCW is a really chill diner-style atmosphere that's kept clean and has some neat chicken paraphernalia decorating the place. 5*-Service/4*-Ambiance

Value- Pretty decent value and a bit cheaper than Lillie Mae's; we paid a little under $15/head for a copious amount of food and drinks. 3*

I really like LLCW and I'd probably rate it at a solid 3.5-stars, but the friendly service, great atmosphere, and fun menu will give it that 4-star bump. My only wish is they would get a children's menu and then they'd really have something. Irregardless, I'd still give it a hearty recommendation."}
{"text":"Sighing...lolos is ight. The chicken had no special flavors, and as well the waffles are 2 thick and heavy..honestly u don't need  2 waffles on the plate becuz u will get full 2 fast and I wasnt happy with paying 4 dollars for a jar of kool-aid and as well 5.69 for the sides...thats 2 pricey, and the portions are not big at all for the price.i was not happy spending 82. Bucks for three people..hell I coulda and shoulda went to churches chick...So disappointed"}
{"text":"YUM - just YUM!  Best fried okra, best fried chicken.  I don't even like eating sweet and savory together for this was too good to pass up!"}
{"text":"kind of a hole in the wall place, but the best chicken & waffles I've had!"}
{"text":"This is my first time in Arizona and I've been to lolos twice. I swear by this place. The catfish beignets and the drinks made with koolaid are the best. It's a must try. And the menu is hilarious."}
{"text":"Love the kool aid!This place was very busy but got seated in a very reasonable time the food was very good and large portions!"}
{"text":"Waited at front for five minutes, no one said hello. Sat at bar, waited ten minutes to order drink.  I already regretted walking here from hotel, should have gone to Denny's.   finally ordered and waited and waited.   Then server came out to tell me they were out of waffle mix.    Asked if I wanted pancakes.   I went to Denny's."}
{"text":"They are located before the security check point  near Gate D,  so you can enjoy a meal before  your flight with friends or family (who aren't traveling). Chicken was better than expected and the service was fast. Greens were seasoned well with a little extra spice. The waffle was just average. It wasn't soggy though, so they must have addressed previous complaints. I came through Phoenix on a Friday evening around 5pm, so my review is based around that time frame. Definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"The airport location gives the stand alone locations a really bad name. We go to the Scottsdale location frequently and love it there. This was our first time trying the airport location. I got the most pathetically small and dry chicken wings. They didn't taste good at all. The rice in the rice & beans was severely undercooked. When I went to the counter to replace it with something else, three employees walked right past me without asking if I needed help. I finally had to flag someone down. I replaced the rice & beans with potato salad. The potato salad seemed as if it was just taken out of the freezer.  

I can't imagine this place will last very long at the airport. If they don't close the doors themselves, I'm sure Sky Harbor will kick them out eventually."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places.  Food is always amazing.  The staff is wonderful. Fried Chicken & Kollard Greens... And Koolaid and Sweet Tea in Mason Jars #MyFavoriteThings"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. I was happy before I arrived because I called ahead of time and found out that the USC v UCLA game would be shown. When we arrived, we were seated immediately and our server, Bre, was incredibly sweet and helpful. Food came out pretty quickly, but it wasn't piping hot. The drinks took a little while too, but that's the only drawback. We were there for the Chicken and Champagne Day Party so we had drink specials and a great DJ as well. Will definitely return when I'm in town."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. 

I grew up in LA and have never gone to Roscoes (OG chicken and waffles place in Los Angeles).  I like chicken and I like waffles.  Not sure why I never went but one day I will.  Here in AZ we have Lo-Lo's.  Tons of great reviews and an endorsement by Charles Barkley was good enough for me.  A chicken and waffle meal was definitely going to happen on this trip.  This morning it did!

We cruised into the place around 10:00am and there were a couple of people already grubbing down.  We were greeted by a nice gentlemen named Carl.  He told us to grab a seat wherever we wanted and that he would be over in a minute.  He cruised by and got us started with our drinks.  I ordered myself a Red Kool Aid..my wife got water.  Carl brought back our drinks in these huge mason jars.  I was impressed.  They freaking have Kool Aid on tap here.  How cool is that?  I started to drink my \"Red Drank\"...it was delicious!  Super duper sweet but I am down with that.  It was refreshing.  Haven't had Kool Aid that good since my grandma used to make it when I was a kid.  Between Kool Aid and Tang, my grandma knew how to mix up the powdered beverages.  Anyways.......  We placed our order with Carl soon after.  My wife and I both decided to get the Number 5...the Sheedahs Special.  Its one waffle, one breast and one wing.  We also got a side of collard greens.  Less than 10 minutes later our food was up.  Here is how everything tasted.....................

Waffle-  Large waffle with a huge dollop of butter on top.  It came with a little thing of syrup too.  I noticed right away that the waffle was pretty soft.  I prefer my waffles to have a little crisp when I bite into them and this one did not.  It still was pretty damn good though.  It held the butter and syrup well and I ate the whole thing.  You could sense a hint of cinnamon and something else in it...maybe vanilla?  I couldn't pinpoint it.  It did its job though.

Fried Chicken-  I got hooked up because my wife gave me her wing so I had 2 wings and a breast.  The coating is a light breading.  The chicken was perfectly cooked, crunchy outside, moist inside.  It was some damn good chicken!  By far the best part of the meal.

Collard Greens-  These were just alright.  I've only had them once or twice before and unfortunately I liked them better the previous times.  I tried to power through most of these but left some uneaten.  I would not get them again.

Overall this place was great!  Carl provided great service and was genuinely friendly and cared about what we thought of the food.  He was on top of everything and made our meal enjoyable.  It was damn near perfect!  A little crunch/crisp on the waffle and we have ourselves a perfect meal.  The chicken was on point and the Kool Aid was great.  I will definitely be back on future visits to AZ!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing environment and excellence service. Our waitress was very friendly helpful and very outgoing. 

There was no wait time. The portions of the food are more then enough. The drinks especially the Kool aid are extremely great :)"}
{"text":"This is one of the best chicken and waffles place that I've had (comparison to Gladys Knight's Chicken and Waffles in Atlanta and Rosco's in Los Angeles, only beaten out by a hole in the wall that I had in Atlanta).      Chicken had a great crust, moist but not dry.   Waffles were excellent.    Sides was the downer if I could pick out something.   I had the cornbread and it was a bit dry for me (I like the moist, honey version) and the greens weren't that spicy.    All of these were very, very minor the excellent food and service I had.   Top 2 Chicken and Waffles places I've had in the world.

{"text":"I came here for breakfast on my last trip to Phoenix and I wasn't hungry again for a good 7-8 hours afterwards. I even did a tough 2.5 mile hike to Piestewa Peak afterwards, and it still wasn't enough to burn off all that food.  

I ordered the #1 (KK's) - the chicken and waffles were both pretty good, but both fell short of Roscoe's here in LA. The chicken was a bit dry and just didn't have enough flavor and the waffles didn't have that hint of cinnamon that Roscoe's has. The grits were good and I really enjoyed the scrambled eggs with cheese and onions... just wish they gave more than two bites of it.

I initially didn't like their gravy, but I grew into it as I continued to eat. It was sweeter than I was used to, but it went well with the food.

Not a bad choice if you're in the area, but I'm afraid I'll have to give the edge to my hometown version."}
{"text":"Lolo's is one of my favorite places to eat in the valley.  Their dining room is very small and sometimes there's a long wait at the door but their staff is always super friendly and there for you if you need anything.

Things I've tried there:

LoLo's special which is 3 piece of chicken with 2 waffles, Stupid fries, side of potatoes smothered, Chyna's honey hots (which are their hotwings), Ivan's chorizo and eggs, and their banana cream pudding.

Their chicken is perfectly cooked.  Nice, crunchy, juicy, and very flavorful.  Their waffles are fantastic as well, but my all time favorite has got to be their Stupid Fries.  It's a basket of freshly cooked french fries smothered in gravy with bits of bell peppers, onions, and chunks of their fried chicken.  I have no idea how they do it but even though their fries are smothered, it stays extra crispy under all that sauce.  That's what makes it so darn delicious.  It's definitely a meal in itself.  Their banana cream pudding is so large you guys can share it.  Banana cream anything is one of my favorites so of course I would say that it was amazing!!

Their koolaide are awesome as well.  You can't come here and not have their koolaide.  I love their blue but I sometime switch it up to red.  My fiance and I have tried their Scottsdale location as well but I feel that the cook at the Phoenix location (which is the original) has got it down packed.  My food always arrive and taste just as good as the last time as to their Scottsdale location, the food doesn't taste the same to me.  Maybe I'm just trippin' but that's how I feel.  

Overall, this place is pretty awesome.  I can't wait for them to finish their expansion."}
{"text":"Waffles were good.  Chicken was good but not as good as at the sister restaurant, Mrs. White's.  Service wasn't very good.  Great cultural experience."}
{"text":"The beautiful Carin and I went to the Village this morning for our respective workouts...She hit the cardio machines hard and I played squash with my buddies.

As I finished my last game with one of my buddies, Jim (who happens to be a cardiologist), he mentioned that I looked a little emaciated...peaked even, and prescribed chicken and waffles, \"stat\" (stat is a medical term that means \"with extra butter, syrup and a side of grits\":)

Fortunately for me there is a new emergency location for Lolo's that has opened up altogether too close to my home:)

Serendipity started to smile on me when we pulled up just as someone was leaving and we scored the parking spot right in front...serendipity continued as we put our name in for the 30 minute wait, only to be called after 15 minutes...and continued to weave it's way through the entire meal, as we got our drinks right away (really, is there much of anything better than a 1/2 gallon of sweet tea with your Saturday afternoon brunch?:), and we were waited on promptly and served right away.

I was saved from wasting away:)

I was particularly delighted for 2 reasons:

     - This was only their second day open in Scottsdale and they were   absolutely slammed with both people eating at Lolo's and with take out orders, so it looked like the service was a little uneven...but the Lolo's staff were so darn nice to everyone, most of the customers seemed  to be pretty understanding:)

     - This was Carin's first experience with Lolo's, and like all of her other \"first times\" with me, I wanted it to be both \"special\" and \"delightful\"...I am a loving, thoughtful and caring husband:)

We couldn't have asked for it to go any better, especially for going by so soon after they opened:)

The chicken and waffles are every bit as good as the original location down on Yuma:)...Carin has fallen in love with Lolo's, too:)

The decor in the new place is pleasant...welcoming and comfortable...I love the wash tub lighting treatments:)

And the staff continues to be pleasant (trending toward sweet as pie) to everyone...they could have been pretty tight-faced today, because they really did have a ton of people (all looking to get their chicken and waffle on) come by Lolo's today.

I wasn't expecting to give these guys 5 stars right out of the gate, but doggone it, they earned it!

Great food, great atmosphere, nice people and now, right in the hood:)

I wonder if Jim is going to send me a bill for the medical advice? :-)"}

Deep in our DNA, we are still pack animals (as in \"a scrum of rugby's\", as opposed to pack animals as in \"pack all that crap on that animals back and let's go\").
My sense of needing to belong was what brought me to Lolo's Chicken and Waffles a few years ago, and my sense of \"I haven't had a decent chicken and waffles fix for a while\" brought me back today!
You won't see me wax rhapsodic over the flavor and lightness of the perfectly crusty and delectable fried chicken...I won't fawn over whoever is in the kitchen turning out delicious waffle after delicious waffle.
I can't sit here all afternoon and go on and on about the many delectable sides like the buttery and cheesy grits, the melt in your mouth fried okra, and the gallons and gallons of sweet tea or homemade lemonade that you can consume with your lunch at Lolo's.
It's not the interesting menu items like fried gizzards, and fish and grits, that you just can't get other places that stir my soul.
I'm not moved to hyperbole (pronounced \"high-per-bowl\":) by the blending of sweet maple syrup, buttered waffles and savory fried chicken on the plate.
I am not reduced to tears by some of the best red velvet cake to come out of an oven in the greater Phoenix Area.
No, it's the people at Lolo's that make me go back, and the sense of belonging and of being one of the Lolo's \"pack\"...that and some of the best fried chicken, waffles, grits and cake that you will ever eat.
Go to Lolo's...you're family, you should drop by once in a while:)"}
{"text":"Yes five stars. Get the chicken and waffles. Just do it. You won't regret it. I had the #8- one breast and one waffle. I also tried the fried okra and it was awesome! It is crowded but worth the wait.  Go!"}
{"text":"My significant other and I came on a busy weekend around lunch time. There was a free valet. The place was packed, so we waited around an hour or so for a table. While we waited, there was a comfy seating area outside and water. 

Once we were seated, we ordered the famous soul food platter to share (where you pick an entree and two sides, and this includes cornbread), along with a red koolaid. We picked the 3 pieces of chicken smothered in gravy & onions for the entree, along with a waffle and mac & cheese for our two sides.

Chicken smothered in gravy and onions:
Maybe it was because I was so hungry by then, but this tasted absolutely delicious. Hot, savory, and crunchy, this chicken lived up to the hype. The chicken was perfectly cooked, and the gravy and onions added a nice salty (but not overwhelming) complement to the crunchy chicken. 

Waffle:
The waffle was great, and also lived up to the hype I expected, as this is one of the signature dishes. It was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The actual size of the waffle looks bigger in photos, probably because the plate is smaller than I imagined, but one waffle is still quite an adequate amount for one person. My SO said this was the best waffle he's ever had. 

Mac & cheese:
This was disappointing. The mac and cheese tasted grainy to me, and the sauce was lumpy rather than smooth. The cheese sauce didn't taste very cheesy to me either. I would not order this again. 

Cornbread:
Warm, slightly sweet, and soft, this cornbread hit the spot. Great supplement to the salty chicken. 

Red koolaid:
This came in a large mason jar and was sweet, but not too sweet, making a refreshing quencher to the savory foods. 

Service:
The complimentary valet was nice, as there were a lot of cars and people around. Our waiter was friendly and prompt with taking our orders, despite the very full restaurant. 

Overall, I would like to come back and eat here again, but not on an empty stomach if it's busy."}
{"text":"As a first timer of the Southern Fried Chicken + Waffle combo, I must say, it's pretty darn good.  The crispy chicken skin was lightly battered and has some killer seasoning on it. Quite addictive. The waffle, while not impressive on its own, tasted really good with the hot syrup and balanced out the saltiness of the chicken.  

It's a good place to grab some economical comfort food right before the airport."}
{"text":"Come for chicken & waffles, stay for kool-aid in a mason jar, candied sweets, buttered grits... leave with diabetes."}
{"text":"We were stopping over from TX on our way back to Las Vegas. I had bookmarked this place even before we had left for TX, so I made it clear that when we head back after our trip...we would come here to eat.

We did that.

It was really easy to find. Pulling in I could see there were people waiting outside for their turn at some Lolos. We didn't get deterred because it didn't look that bad of a wait. Entering the restaurant...it was packing in there! It was a Sunday afternoon around 1 something, and it was filled! Anyway, we were told twas going to be a 45 minute wait. Initially, I thought crap...only because we had been driving since El Paso and there were hungry lions to be fed. THANKFULLY, we didn't have to wait for 45 minutes. Apparently, most the folks waiting ahead of us lost patience and left. Welp, yay for us. Hallelujuer. Think we waited for about 20minutes.

We get seated and was not immediately greeted by a waiter/tress. But, I didn't mind because we were trying to tame these wild animals into their seats all while trying to stare at the menu (which btw we were already staring at the to-go menus they had available as we were waiting to be seated). I'd say 5 minutes later our waitress comes by and tells us she'll be right with us as she has dirty plates in tow. 

She comes back, we order immediately. Hungry and on a time battle here. I ordered the toy-toy. 2 wings and a waffle. The boys ordered their chicken tenders that come with cornbread, and the husband orders 3pc chicken with waffles. 

Dining out I am not one to order fried chicken. Mainly because I've tried chicken that isn't home cooked and they've all tasted nasty. Like, well cooked on the outside...still soggy from the batter on the inside, salty, peppery, lack of meat, oily, etc...so ordering the 2 wings was ideal for me because incase I did not like the chicken...it wouldn't be much chicken to eat, thus, wouldn't be much chicken to go to waste.

Never fails, the 1 time I'm being cautious is the 1 time.im thinking, damnt! Their chicken was NOT dry. It was moist, seasoned properly, and just cooked almost perfectly. I say almost because I like my wings to be extra crispy. But for someone who doesn't order chicken dining out, it was close to perfect. The waffle was nice and soft with crisp edges. 

Tried my boys tenders and those things were fat and moist as well! The cornbread, however, which comes with their plate was overcooked. You could tell it was just by looking at it. It looked like it was 5 minutes away from becoming burnt. I love cornbread. However, I didn't love cornbread on this day. 

Also, the fries that came with my boys' plates...I felt were way too seasoned. I had to dust off the seasoning just so my toddler can enjoy it properly. It just became way too salty after each fry. 

In conclusion, it's a chicken and waffle joint. Their chicken and waffle did not disappoint at all! They do have LOTS of other items on their menu if chicken and waffles aren't your fancy. I can see where people may feel they are pricey in some parts of their menu, but from my quick experience...it's worthed. I really wish we had more time so I could explore their other items, but we will save that for another trip. We had a nice experience, despite the children going wild. Lol. Will DEFINITELY return and will definitely put my stamp of recommendation."}
{"text":"First off.. back home (Northern California) I have to go to either Oakland OR Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in LA to get anything decent (I live in Santa Cruz... aka either a 5 hour drive or a 1 1/2 hour drive to get some southern goodness). This was on my list of places to go since our SBCer transplant got an ROTD at the other location.  

Honestly, for me personally the chicken and waffles were average *ducks and covers*  The waffles had little flavor and the chicken was meh....I will stick with Roscoe's down in LA.

The sides however were ridiculously bomb: 
The grits were cooked perfectly to our liking and were served with a big #$cking thing of butter.. amen...amen. The home potatoes were light, crispy and well seasoned. The collard greens were by far the best I have had in a minute..they were not too salty... not super soppy/mushy and came in the perfect sized bowl. Drinks came in a jam jar and once half consumed we were asked if wanted it either in a to go drink container (GENIUS!) or if we wanted more... I knew we had a drive with no real established potty so we declined.

Clean establishment with an autograph wall in the back (very cool). Service was good.... no complaints."}
{"text":"This is the original location, I've been going here for years. I've been to the old and the new locations in Scottsdale and they just don't touch this one. My favorite dish is no longer an option on the menu, which saddened me greatly, but I still love the other options. I've told so many people about Lo-Lo's . Really like that they serve their drinks in mason jars and that they have authentic Kool-Aid and sweet tea. This is true soul food in the desert. Looking forward to getting my fix soon."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I absolutely love this place. The chicken is always fresh and crispy and the waffle recipe is the best! That plus kool aid on tap equals amazing dining experience. Super friendly staff as well, always attentive and cheerful."}
{"text":"So excited to try Lolo's, I went in looking to get the full soul food/chicken and waffle expereince and I knew I had to head to tha' \"hood\" to get it.  
This location is a small house that has tables in the various rooms, the space is a little tight but home-y.   Once I ordered I had my food within minutes!  I had the red Kool-Aid served in a large mason jar. I wanted to have the full Lolo's experience so I ordered a side of mac n cheese and collard greens to compliment my waffle and chicken. Oh boy was I pleased. The waffle is light and flavorful with just a hint of cinnamon. I make sure to get a bite with waffle and chicken, syrup covered and a dash of hot sauce. YUMMM!!! 
I can't wait to go again and I recommend it to all my friends!!"}
{"text":"I'd really like to give this place another star. But the service is inconsistent, some servers need training instead of just being let loose on unsuspecting customers. You can't teach some people to enjoy their jobs and let it show. And than other servers are great like they want to be there and serve you. I blame the poor training on management. 
The foods always been good, sometimes great. Fried chicken is one of my favorites and it's done just right. I also like catfish, but that's been kind of iffy. The luck of the draw."}
{"text":"I wasn't in a big hurry to board my plane home so I decided to try this instead of the barbecue place next door. I suppose, in retrospect, the lack of a line should have been a clue. 

Food wise it was decent. The chicken was actually very good but could have used some more spice to it. Then again, this is southern style. It was crispy and the meat juicy. The waffles were soggy and nothing to write home about. 

The service was atrocious I ordered and gave them my name, paid (too much, but airport fare so it's acceptable) and then waited, waited, and waited some more. The counter clerk came out and called for another name repeatedly but it wasn't mine. I drank my drink and read FB and waited some more. Finally I realized that my plane was going to board in 15 minutes and I still had to clear security and had no food. I walked up to the counter and asked if my food was ever going to be ready and the clerk told me it had been ready and why hadn't I come and gotten it. I told her they never called my name and she blamed the cook in back. She obviously recognized me and I was sitting about 15-20' away. She could have tapped me on the shoulder or called out what the order was but she didn't. I didn't have time to complain to the manager, but I somehow suspect they wouldn't have cared either. 

Avoid if you don't want crappy customer service."}
{"text":"I love fried chicken and fried okra an collards. The food here was not so good. The chicken was smothered in a very very salty gravy with spicy sausage in it. I will not eat here again and cannot recommend this place."}
{"text":"Called in an order to speed up the process, upon arrival I see the drink (sitting there getting watered down), than although the food was ready and paid for waited for someone to hand it off. The food was good as expected, just seems like need more staff to tend to the to-go orders"}
{"text":"I came here with my husband, mom, and aunt on a whim.  My aunt really wanted chicken and waffles, and she said this was the place to go.  I'm glad we listened to her.  The food was tasty and prompt - they all ordered chicken and waffles, but I went with catfish.  I know, I know, totally wrong and weird to order here, but it was really good.  Not my all-time favorite catfish, but good!

Service was great, food was good, and my mom loved that they serve sweetened tea (she's from Nebraska, where this is a foreign concept).  Keep up the good work :)!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday morning, not busy at all, and now we know why. My fiancé and I loved the one in Scottsdale but I never even received my plate of food! We left after my fiancé finished his dry chicken. No refills on our drinks, no discount on his food. Save yourself a BIG disappointment and AVOID this dump."}
{"text":"I've loved fried chicken for 50 years. Yes, 50 years. Never have I had fried chicken that had absolutely no flavor. Until now. I was utterly amazed to find a place with \"chicken\" in its name that didn't know how to fry a good chicken. Not even salt and pepper. I ate my greasy pieces in wonderment. Is this really possible? Did they do this on purpose? Do they have a new cook who forgot the most crucial step? Do they think that Phoenix has so many seniors with dead taste buds that no one would notice? Somebody enlighten me! In the meantime, I say no no to Lo Lo."}
{"text":"My first time here with my fiancé, and we weren't disappointed! The food was amazing and our waitress made the experience even more enjoyable. I stuck with the classic chicken breast with a waffle. The chicken was perfectly cooked with a wonderful crunchy skin! The waffle was light and I LOVE that they have Kool Aid!"}

{"text":"Great soul food. Get the half breed (lemonade and Kool aid)! Chicken, waffles, and corn bread"}
{"text":"Went to this location last week - was nervous to go because although I love waffles, and fried chicken, the idea of eating them together freaked me out.  But my husband is a huge fan, so I decided to suck it up.  I'm glad I did... Although I typically prefer my waffles a little crispier than LoLo's makes them, the flavor was to die for!!!  And who doesn't love some delicious fried chicken!  I know I do.... Try it!  You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Great staff, great food! I recommend taking some of it home so you don't get the itis"}
{"text":"My husband is from the south and is very particular about his fried chicken.  He loved it!!  The staff is super friendly and I really love the fried green tomatoes.  I can't wait until the Gilbert location opens."}
{"text":"Wow!! Love this place so much!! 

Let me start off by saying me and my boyfriend were going to phoenix to visit an old friend. I found this place online and decided to try it. Not ever been to Arizona, i admit the area scared me a little bit haha! we stopped by this shady looking gas station like 2 mins away from it and asked one of the employers where lo lo's was. He said to park in the back so we got in the car and started to search for it. It was about 8 at night. We drove into the back lot and DUDE IT LOOKED SO BAD!!!. Being a wimp i started to not want to persue the place anymore. My bf insisted to park in front and we did. Our friend went came and we went it. It was ... SO NICE INSIDE!! Very clean, well lit, and festive!

I  felt sorry I judged it before i went in. I  ordered the number 9, which was chicken thigh and leg with a waffle. Filled me up just right! the waffles were soooo goood! tasted of cinnamon and the butter was light. 

I also ordered the red velvet cake because i love red velvet and i heard it was the best. SADLY I didn't like it. The moistness was really good, but i thought the velvet would be more rich and the frosting was too cheesy for my liking. This cake could be very true to how its originally made so that is probibly why its pretty different from the others I've had. 

over all 4/5 stars!!!~ Will be back again!!~"}
{"text":"Kind of an odd review, but I did not get to eat here.  Sat down and had my mouth watering waiting to place my order.... then the server showed up and told me the credit card machine was dead and could only take cash.   I carry NO cash.  So she gave me a recommendation on somewhere else to go try.  
I will be back to eat next time I am in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but the service was horrible. I find it absolutely ridiculous that the staff was unwilling to split the bill for our table!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today, 40 min wait but then they offered up the patio right away. Wasn't too unbearable with the misters. 

Got our dranks quickly, however due to me ordering a cheeseburger the food delivery took about 40 minutes.

Food was good, not to die for though. Won't order the Mac and cheese again.

Wife ordered chicken and waffle.  Said was good, likes the thin waffles. 

Ordered the red velvet cake for myself, not impressed. Maybe it wasn't made recently, very dry. Definitely not as good as Grandma made it.

We'd probably go back again, but not right away."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles was a mainstay of living in Carolina. People used to laugh about the combo, but now it is quite hip, and found in upscale LA, SF, LV, even NY versions. They are good but they are mostly overpriced knock-offs. LoLos is a knock-off on Mrs Whites', but I suspect she(mom) approves. This is real deal, and worth every penny"}
{"text":"We had been in PHX for @ a year and mija was craving a Southern home-cooked meal, so we tried Lo-Lo's.  1st visit, she ordered the Chicken & Waffles. She loved the chicken, but said the waffles were \"alright.\" She fancies the catfish as well, but sometimes she gets \"gypped\" on the size/portion.  She since has become a fan of their chicken tenders, and she loves their Kool-Aid beverage options.

I like that they have a veggie platter, for which you may choose 4 sides.  If you're vegan, you can eat many of the sides (they do not use meat in any of their vegetables): greens, green beans, home fries, and regular fries are my go-to options.  The home fries are always amazing and tasty.  The greens and green beans are hit or miss.  Sometimes they are great, other times they taste like they've come from a can; I hate those times.  Their fried okra is bland; needs more southern love/flavor. The cornbread, mac n' cheese, etc., are vegetarian, but not vegan-friendly.

Not cheap. I spend no less than $40 for 2 people, every time. 
Some of the waiters and waitresses are very sweet.
Gospel music plays on Sundays; makes me feel like less of a heathen. 
Large TVs can be seen from anywhere you sit, and it's always displaying a sport of some sort.
The wait on the weekend can easily surpass 60 minutes, and they do not take reservations. 

Their Scottsdale location is within a strip mall with Chipotle, Smash Burger, etc, so you'll sometimes have to fight for parking with some of the surrounding eateries' patrons, especially on a Sunday or weekend evening.  And it's hard to find if you don't know where you're going, so be on the lookout for one of the aforementioned establishments and you'll see LoLo's.  Or GPS works too."}
{"text":"I'm struggling with the rating on this one... I'm feeling 1-2 stars for its blatant mockery of real, down home southern cooking, which peeves me to my core, and them having the audacity to overcharge for this.  But then I feel like maybe they should get 3 stars for the menu options (which include a veggie platter), nice atmosphere, and good service, which we typically receive, especially since they've moved to this location.  I keep seeing these 4 & 5 star reviews with praises of the awesome southern cooking and/or soul food.  In the words of Inigo Montoya, \"You keep using that word.  I do not think it means what you think it means.\"  

I'm thinking that the majority of you aren't from the south, so you have nothing to which you can compare your \"southern\" experience.  I've come to the conclusion that this place is for you people.  I look at you the same way that my Mexican friends look at me when I eat Taco Bell and call it \"Mexican\" food.  

Alas, I do not eat meat, so my experience is as a vegan, therefore, in fairness, I'll stick with 3-stars and move on.


Food:
What I do really like here is that they do NOT use animal products in their greens and string beans; these side items are completely vegan-friendly.  This is very rare (non-existent) with southern-style cooking, which typically uses ham or turkey as a flavoring for vegetables (especially greens, string beans, beans, black-eyed peas, etc). 

They offer a Veggie Platter, which comes with your choice of 4 sides and a corn bread muffin (which is vegetarian, but not vegan).  The following are some of the vegan-friendly sides for the veggie platter. 

COLLARD GREENS: hit or miss.  They never taste completely fresh, but sometimes they're ok with the help of the hot sauce.  Other times they're like flavorless Glory greens.  You can have amazing southern greens without meat.  I don't cook, but I can make some mean, meatless, mamma-jamma greens, so there is just no excuse. 

STRING BEANS & RED POTATOES:
*rolls eyes* Child please. One time, only once, did I get a fresh batch of green beans, and I'm convinced that it must have been because they ran out of cans and had to resort to fresh ones.  All other times? Straight-from-the-can tasting green beans, also seriously lacking in flavor. I kick myself every time I give them another try.

SAUTÉED SPINACH:
Pretty darn tasty and fresh!  Whatever seasoning is used on the spinach needs to be shared with the rest of the green veg family. Sharing is caring. 

HOME FRIES:
Ok, these are bomb! They are triangular chunks of skin-on potatoes seasoned with their amazing seasoning, and cooked with red & green peppers and onions. So good!  Sometimes I get a double order. 

FRENCH FRIES:
Basically, their bomb seasoning transforms these fries from boring to superstar status. (Maybe they should try this seasoning on the other vegetables?)


Other items I've tried after being annoyed by the greens and green beans...

BEANS OVER RICE and FRIED OKRA:
The beans & rice are what I call, Red Beans and Rice, but theirs is without the southern appeal.   Both of these dishes are bland, bland, bland.  I swear, if I shake my head any harder, it may swivel off its hinges.  The beans and rice could use a vegetable based broth, and the okra just needs seasoning.

There are no vegan desserts; vegetarian, yes, but vegan, no. 

My DD usually gets either the Chicken Tender Basket or Chicken and Waffles.  She says their fried chicken is almost as good as Sweetie Pies, back home, so that's saying something.  She said the waffles are just ok, and that if you like doughy waffles then you wouldn't like these.


They've expanded their menu and added items like Spicy Corn Fritters, Fried Green Beans, Fried Green Tomatoes, and Catfish Beignets, all of which my DD says are delish.  (I am waiting on confirmation from management as to if the fried veggies are vegan-friendly.)  They fact that they changed their menu indicates that they are open to change, which is a great thing.  Maybe there is hope for better tasting greens and string beans in the future. 

I really like this new location and the set up.  It still gets crazy crowded, and if a booth isn't available you're stuck at tables that are really close to other patrons, which I don't like.  (I always wait on a booth.)  But service has always been really good for us.  There's a set of twins (I can't tell them apart) who are excellent servers with great personalities. 


All in all, I like the concept: bringing southern food favorites to the southwest.  The \"Hood Classics\" and Kool-Aid are funny and nice touches to the theme. And I love that there are people from all backgrounds who come here and enjoy the food.  But I'm assuming that in their desperation to keep up with the demand of the large crowds, the real southern-tasting soul food was lost along the way.  Luckily, the masses don't know the difference so they should be able to keep this charade up for the long-run."}
{"text":"I really like the Chicken and the Waffles here.  Both are tasty  Good stuff.    I'm not big on the big glass of colored super-sugar water they call Koolaid.  Yikes that's a lot of sugar!

These guys would get 5 stars from me except the wait on the weekend afternoons is stupid!  We tried on Saturday but didn't want to wait 1/2hr, came back Sunday with a couple more people and were told 45 minutes.  Over an hour later we harassed them into putting together some patio tables so we could EAT.  It was cold and windy and kinda sucked, but the food is yummy so we were mostly pacified.

I recommend going here, just pick a quiet time if there is one."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS small. REALLY REALLY small.  Good thing theyr'e planning to build a new one.

I got take out and drove 20 minutes back to work.  Not Good.  My stomach was growling at me - loud enough I could focus on nothing else.  They gave me melted butter, hot sauce & syrup with my chicken & waffle.  I'm so full right now.  Fat & Happy.  Very very happy."}
{"text":"I've been going to Lo-Lo's for years, back when they only had this one location. I love the food quality/freshness at both this location and the Scottsdale location BUT I just personally like the vibe at the Central location better. It's more relaxed; the servers are attentive but distant (super friendly), which I prefer when dining out. They always remember us and welcome us back. Scottsdale location is cool, but the staff seems very strained, like they're uncomfortable almost. Weird vibe, still love going regardless. But if you're in town (downtown)and want to try Lo-Lo's I highly recommend visiting the Central location. Try the home fries and/or biscuits & gravy if you're not big on chicken and waffles. Tip: Order your drink in a to-go cup, so you can take your Kool-Aid with you :)"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious. The macaroni? To die for. Chicken? Fried to a delicious golden melt-in-your-mouth crisp. The waffles have a hint of cinnamon which for some reason I'm a huge fan of. The corn muffins-with a bit of butter and honey- are some of the most delicious (and biggest!) I've had since Sunday dinners with grandma as a child. 

Customer service was on point the first time, although the second time the waitress seemed to think that the large group I was in was all paying together and definitely took her time splitting the check.

Go for a mix of blue raspberry koolaid and lemonade. Cuts the sugary bite in half nicely. Or, they're mixed drinks if you're feeling daring."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday and it was great! I love fried chicken and theirs is really great especially if you add on the Louisiana hot sauce...ummm! Shared a KK's which consisted of 3 pieces of fried chicken, 2 waffles, grits, and scrambled eggs with cheese and onions. The waffles were tasty. The eggs were just alright. Then I had some grits for the first time and my friend said you really gotta add some salt and sugar to make it awesome...and that is exactly how you do it! The portions are pretty decent for its price. The service was great...the workers always came by to check on us."}
{"text":"I'm going to preface this review with this statement: DON'T EAT THE CAKE. Really, what was an otherwise fantabulous meal was ruined by my slice of red velvet cake. Cake is loosely used to define this...thing. It tasted like raw biscuit dough. It was wet, mushy, and the only flavor was red food dye. Even the frosting was terrible. *sigh*

BUT! The chicken fried chicken was fantastic, the candy sweets and collards were great. And the cornbread was darn tasty. And, hey, you serve me a refreshing beverage in a Mason jar, and I'm a happy camper. I ate like a pig, left full as a tick and still have a doggy bag with half my food waiting for me in the fridge. Midnight snack? Breakfast with a couple eggs over easy? Either way, yum again! 

So you'll enjoy your meal...as long as you avoid the cake!"}
{"text":"For heart attack, drop dead chicken and the best waffles I've eaten in years, Lo-Lo's rocks. LoLo's catered a breakfast for a non-profit I am involved with and they did an awesome job. However, our mission is good health and preventing work disability, so unfortunately, the others in the group have outlawed Lo-Lo's for future events. It appears we have to actually practice what we preach. Bummer."}
{"text":"The buzz has been heard for the past 6 years I've resided in Phoenix- Lolo's chicken and waffles is a must try! So I finally did today. I've came by the restaurant in the past, only to find long lines or lack of parking so it's steered me away to come back another time. Today, I got the chance to sit and dine with no wait as I was running late meeting with some pals. It is 3 PM on a Sunday afternoon, so it was busy and every seat taken. We order the bottomless mimosas and are served by our friendly waitress. When it's time to order, I go for the number 3 \"Lolo's\" which was three chicken pieces and 2 waffles. If I were to come back I'll go with a smaller portion as I didn't realize these chicken pieces (leg, wing, and breast) were not small! The waffles too were pretty big! Glad to finally try Lolo's out, it isn't the best fried chicken, and I'm comparing the chicken and waffles to that one other I went to in Brooklyn, NY (Sweet Chic, A++++!)... the friendly vibe and portion size make up for it. This restaurant's cleanliness was well kept but I speak for this location.  You should give it a shot, too!"}
{"text":"A hole in the wall in South Phoenix.... 

I order: The \"Betty Boop\" - a plate with 1 waffle and 1 fried chicken breast.  Add a huge mason jar of the sweetest & reddest Koolaid (or Sweet Tea - depending on my mood) and a side of grits drowning in melted butter and I'm a happy girl.

Their Red Velvet Cake is also amazing. 

I know fried chicken and waffles seem like an odd combination but it's really interesting and satisfying - with the syrup and hot sauce for the chicken.... Yum Yum.  

It's one of my family's favorites!!!  

TRY IT!!!!"}
{"text":"Getting in to Lo Lo's is ridiculous! They've seated several large parties ahead of us and literally smile at us as they call the next party. Up until today I really liked this place but I'll take me money elsewhere! The chicken is good but it's not worth the 45 minute wait...we're still not seated and they told us the table was ready 5 minutes ago! Come on Lo Lo's get you're act together!"}
{"text":"Lemme just add to the wonderfulness that is Lo-Lo's. Although I have only been to the Scottsdale one, I must say it was wonderful. Chicken yum! Waffles yum! Candied yams yum! Mac & Cheese yum!"}
{"text":"I visited during the week and experienced a 15 minute to be seated as I chilled on the comfortable shaded patio. Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles was an Outstanding 5 Star experience for My 1st visit to 1220 S Central Ave, Phoenix, AZ 85003. Ask for LAQWAN because he was the Man from start to finish. I ordered 3 wings that were seasoned perfectly, still juicy and piping hot just the way I like them. The waffles had a really good texture and even better taste with a great blend of seasoning. The kool aid was cold and sweet. This meal didnt lack anything. HIGHLY Recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing! A must stop destination when your in the area! Food was flavorful and filling. Server was friendly and attentive. 
I ordered breakfast which came with the works ( eggs, grits, potatoes ). The waffles were so yummy that I barley used any syrup ! 
When you go be sure to treat yourself to one the sweet mason jar beverages."}
{"text":"Pros

Nice building
Good size chicken pieces
Great music playing r & b
Clean
Large drink sizes
Waffles were pretty good

Cons 

A lot of staff yet one person checks on you 
Extra charges to meal without serves telling
Eggs with cheese and onions were nothing special
Grits- needed lots of salt and butter and I never use salt 
Credit/debit machine down right when I need to pay
Asked to give cash then they asked to write my credit card number down?
Racist Manager/Owner and he is African AMerican!
Are they crazy this is still the hood?!?"}
{"text":"if you're ever up for some artery-clogging good food....this is the place to go. okay, if you're just up for some awesome chicken and waffles, this will do too. 

this place is just SO bad for you, but so flippin' good! i had waffles, chicken, a sweet potato, fried okra, corn bread, and a sweet tea. okay so i didn't finish it all, but i tried a bit of everything. if you have a sweet tooth this place will definitely satisfy it. the sweet potato was more like a dessert....and would you like some tea with your sugar? holy cow it's sweet. the corn bread is awesome, the chicken is perfect, and the waffles are great. just be sure to have someone ready to wheel you out when you're done."}
{"text":"How have I never tried this place before. Delicious fried goodness.
If you are looking to break your diet.. Well this is the place. The chicken is fried and seasoned perfectly well. Unfortunately, I was not impressed with the waffle. It seemed a little flimsy and not too fluffy.

Aside from the food, the parking was a horrible mess. We had to Valet. I couldn't believe it, but had to since I did not want my car to get towed if I parked in the hotel parking lot.

I would definitely give this place another try."}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back to this place. Anyways I went there for a Christmas party. I know kind of strange. But WoW, the food here is amazing. The place is super nice and prices, I think very reasonable and food fantastic. My chicken came with the most incredible, enormous corn Bread, and oh yeah Mac & cheese. This place is defiantly not a place if your on a diet. Try it on a cheat day. Anyways the food is delicious. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"It was ok... 

I was expecting more of A Roscoes type ordeal but I guess my expectations were a tad high... dont get me wrong I did clean my plate but it wasnt worth the 1hr my family & I waited."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles has to be on of those classic combos like Burger and fires Or Pizza and wings. And at Lo Lo's the did it right. The chicken was very well seasoned and fried nice and crispy. Just the right amount of crunch before getting a mouth full of juicy meat. When they brought the waffle I could smell the cinnamon in it before I could even taste it. I wasn't sure if I was going to be into the cinnamon waffle but the cinnamon wasn't over powering at all. I ordered apple juice and they bring it in a huge mason jar. Couldn't even finish it. 

On to the service. Our waitress Raquel was so sweet and very friendly. The place was very clean and the employees were all very friendly and greeted us with a smile. 

Next time I'm back in Phoenix I will definitely go back to Lo Lo's."}
{"text":"Being from Cali our go to Chicken and Waffles place is Roscoe's. But Lolo's seems to be a hit out here. 

Fun restaurant with good service and cute decor. Food wise, the waffle at Roscoe's is better. The waffle here was a little more doughy and not as flavorful. Chicken here is better though, crispy on the outside moist inside and flavorful but not salty. The \"dranks\" here are crazy sweet, I asked for a cup to pour out half my sweet tea and diluted it with half a glass of water lol. Same goes for the lemonade. The grits, mac and cheese and cornbread are yummy. Would love to come back and try some more side dishes!"}
{"text":"This is by far, the best chicken and waffles I've ever tasted. I've tried them all...in Oakland, Long Beach, and Los Angeles. And none of the restaurants can compare to Lo-Lo's!! The waffles are amazing, it's fluffy and soft while the chicken is crisp and juicy. I love how they have Kool-Aid too. The other restaurants I've tried in California don't have Kool-Aid!!! And the Kool-Aid at Lo-Lo's is fantastic...it has a perfect balance of flavor and sweetness. It's like they put crack in it or something! My girlfriend had the \"Stupid Fries\" which had cheese, peppers, onions, and chicken smothered all over french fries. It's crazy good too and I definitely recommend to order that as an appetizer to share. Can't wait to return to this place again when I come back to Phoenix :0)"}
{"text":"Fist and last time LoLo's will get another dime of my hard earned money !! The food was good (I'll give them that-1 star) and our waiter \"Carlos\" did his absolute best to improve our experience (2nd star). 
The problem with this establishment is the Management: If that's what you call standing around in the parking lot talking to people and doing absolutely nothing to help your staff on a busy Saturday night. This gentleman must be related to someone because a Manger he is not !! What I was even more surprised  to find was that when I went through a few more reviews that most of the negative comments were regarding the Manager and to date nothing seems like it has changed !!So here was my 1st experience:
1). No reservations, there were 6 of us (45 min. wait).
2). Oder taken within 15-20 min.
3). Food took another 30 min to come and came out one plate @ a time (one plate came out, then 10 min. later another and so on) until they got to the last plate which took another 30 min to come out ( I like to Yelp, good and bad so yes I was looking @ the clock: In disbelief and to give an accurate review). So at this point we have been there almost 3 hours and keep in mind the orders were pretty basic: Fried Chicken, greens, mac & cheese, Fried Catfish, green beans and yams (most of what should be already in a pot-the only thing you need to do is season and fry the meat).
4). We asked for a Manager, no manager came -twice.
5). A server's chicken flew off the plate onto the floor, no Manager (next to us).
6). A server was cleaning off a table and dropped the plates, no Manger (next to us)
7) We finally stopped a bald gentleman with gold wire framed glasses who said he was the Manger (because the one we requested never came). We relayed our experience and the fact that by this time our guest was so upset that her food had taken so long (the last plate) that she couldn't even eat it. The Manager's response \"This is not the way we do business but we don't comp meals\" no eye contact but he repeated it twice like from memory (did I mention our bill was over $100.00). The Chicken dinner was $14 and It was not about the money it was about the Customer Service (but a trained and educated Manager would have known this) !
8). In comes Carlos (the Waiter), who we let know it was obvious he had no Management support and we knew he was doing his best. Again he was apologetic and sincere and even took $7 off of the bill (it was still over $100 for Fried Chicken and Cat Fish).
***So if you want to wait along time to be seated and even longer for your food, be ignored by Management (who could care less if you have a good experience or not) and pay over $100 for some pretty good chicken and fish - This is the place for you !!

Otherwise spend your money somewhere else where they \"Thank you for coming\" !"}
{"text":"underwhelming. actually worse than that. i'm actively opposed to coming back

the parking situation is BS, just BS. fix it.

the new layout is fine. they built it like a sports bar. you know how in certain stupid restaurants you KNOW you pay a premium for the food so that you can sit in a taller leather booth and have like 3 46\" LED TVs within view? this place is the perfect example of that

it took 50 minutes to get our food from the time we ordered it. that number is precise. we got, you know, chicken and waffles. our waitress was sweet and polite but messed up the drink orders, and then again by telling us our order was \"next in line\" after half an hour. don't do that.

the waffles are thin! the chicken is whatever!!!! that's really all there is to it. whoever is in charge of this place put ALL the effort into the \"ambiance\" (listen up team, we really gotta hone in on that dave and busters vibe), shitty punny t-shirts for the staff, and the instagram feed. 

i have such an icky feeling about it in retrospect. just like a sticky, gross, awful hangover vibe for $17. skip this place. it's a mess."}
{"text":"I'm the idiot that came to Lo-Lo's for toast and eggs. (Hey, I was stuffed from a day of non-stop gluttony the previous day!)

The problem with ordering simple fare in Lo-Lo's is watching everyone else's food roll out. Yes, fried chicken smells delicious. Large, generous portions. The waffles, when smothered in butter and layered in syrup, smell delightful. 

Grits - I finally could not control my fork, and sampled my neighbor's - are delicious. So gosh darn good I might return to Lo-Lo's strictly for the grits. But this time I'll be sure to leave room for a #8. A popular item in our large breakfast group.

The staff at Lo-Lo's are remarkable. While our group had yet to fully arrive on time (AHEM, late comers) the hostess served me coffee. 

Yes, I was that person. I really needed a cup of Joe. It was my birthday! Coffee to the rescue! (at 8:30 for anyone on time!) Monico O. did a superb job selecting the final location for Breakfast Club. {Applause and thanks!}

Happy Hour Details
M-F 3-7pm

Bar seems perfect for catching a game with the television space. Outdoor patio has ready viewing access to televisions.

Neat!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Lo-Lo's four times now, and each time I've left feeling under-whelmed. I live within walking distance, so convenience is a factor when I chose to eat here. During this last visit I came alone, needing some soul food after receiving some not-so-good news. During my other visits their were at least 2 of us, sometimes 4, so the poor service has nothing to do with the size of the table. Needless to say my server Abigail, was too good to come by more than 3 times to entire time I was sitting, waiting for my food. She was way too busy bossing the other employees around to notice that I hadn't gotten my food in over 25 minutes so I asked another employee of they could check for me. When they brought it out, it was obvious that it had been finished for a while and was just sitting back waiting for my server to drop it. Mind you, I'm sitting solo directly beside the kitchen door (which gave me a straight line of view inside, which I wouldn't recommend watching them cook). I was unimpressed by my chewy, mildly warm waffle, & watered down syrup. The chicken was so inconsistently battered and seasoned that there were some bites that lacked all flavor, and some bites it was wet clumps of seasoning mixed in the batter. The bad service & poor quality food makes me doubt I'll ever come back, even if I am less than 2 blocks away. I'm from the Midwest and lived in Louisville Kentucky for several years, which is the fried chicken capital of the world & this place is just an overly gentrified marketing scheme & lacks real SOUL. And no, I'm not talking about disgusting KFC! Research Indi's fast food, and that will show you REAL, spicy, soulful fried chicken. The koolaid is nice and sweet tho, & better be for $3. My total for one waffle, three chicken strips and a grape koolaid was $17.50 plus tax. Pretty sure I was overcharges somewhere, but Abigail couldn't even bring me my change back. Again, I'm sitting right by the POS & kitchen, so I know she was just avoiding me to keep the tip. Which would have yielded her more if she would have brought it back instead of assuming. Ask yourself Lo Lo's, where's the love & soul? It's def not in your food or customer service! Do you even know what keel is? Are your greens simmered slow from fresh or canned? And there's only one type of hot sauce? Lo-lo's brand of course. Which was watered/vinegar'd down & barely had any spice. What a shame. Personally, this place reminds me of a rip off of roscoes in LA. Except roscoes is worth the 5 hour trip from scottsdale. This place isn't even worth the stroll down the block for me."}
{"text":"This place had great food and incredible service. I really wish Arizona had places like this when I lived here in the 90's. The one drawback of this location is the parking. All of the spots in front of the restaurant are reseved for the hotel next door. So your parking options are valet or park on the other side of the hotel and walk. We wete here on a Sunday morning so they were busy but we still got our meals in a timely manner. I would definitely try this place if you are ever in the area."}
{"text":"It's definitely a good place for chicken and waffles and it's much better than the over rated Roscoe's in Los Angeles, but it is still not the best I have had. Both chicken and waffle are prepared decent but nowhere near a knock out 

The staff were excellent"}
{"text":"Food was delicious but the service was even better. Neal made the experience a 10/10. Super fun and friendly, just a great person. He recommended the platter with the mac n cheese. Sooooo delicious. But yeah a great time and excellent service. Neal gets a raise."}
{"text":"Best southern fried chicken in town! Have been back many times.  I usually have a waffle with two pieces of fried chicken.  The southern fried chicken is always very tasty, crispy and fresh. I have found the service to be excellent. Everything is fresh and made to order. Our coffee cups were always refreshed and other drinks were very good. This is a real down to earth eatery with good soul food for a very fair price. I would go back again. Parking is a little hard at times."}
{"text":"Terrible experience, didn't even get to sit down.

Walked in and the hostess wanted to seat us at a table in the middle of the busy dining room. I asked to be seated one table over which was more out of the way. I was quickly told that table was not available because the waitress was on break. 

When we questioned her, she replied, \"Oh, I'm not kidding! See all those other tables, those are hers, too. I can't seat you there either. See? She's on break right over there.\"

We were incredulous. We turned around and walked out.

I'd heard great things about the food here and wanted to try it. But not so badly that I will allow a waitress to dictate at what table I sit. The lunatics do not run the asylum.

Now since I've had such a bad experience without even siting down, I certainly won't be back and I'm angry enough to write a and review. 

The hostess should have thought things through a bit better."}
{"text":"On point! Chicken cooked perfectly - crispy and juicy, waffle done well, kool aid on tap, and awesome Mac and Cheese. 1st place I've been where the Mac and cheese was actually good. Stays creamy and has a lot of flavor. Definitely coming back! You gotta try it!"}
{"text":"Pros - fried chicken, spicy collard greens, buttered corn, Kool-aid, and very friendly service.

Cons - dry chicken breast (it was my attempt at being healthy...I should have known better), and waffles weren't up to my expectations.

It took me 8 years to go to Lo-Lo's.  The chicken was delicious.  The next time I go, I'm going to order chicken wings, collard greens, cornbread, and Kool-aid.  Skip the waffles and any attempt at being healthy."}
{"text":"Loved this place visiting from D.C. the service was amazing the food was amazing we had to wait for like 30 mins but so worth it! The owner was very friendly too!"}
{"text":"Great Chicken, but we got served our entree before we got our drink order.  Service a bit too good.

Parking is a nightmare, had to use their valet."}
{"text":"NOT BAD FOR EATING AT THE AIRPORT

Chicken: flavorful and crispy if you're lucky. Some of the thighs weren't as crispy which sucked. 

Waffles: average tasted like Roscoes. Only negative was it was soft because it came in a to go box the steam ruined the exterior. 

Gravy: they have two types. The white gravy with sausage was delicious! The LoLo gravy has onions which we passed on. 

Mac and cheese: pretty good. It's the dry thick version which is my fav. 

Corn bread: very dense and semi-moist. Only the center was soft. The exterior was pretty hard and dry. 

I think had we gone to the real LoLo's we would've had better prepared food. But I still gave it a 4 star for it being pretty tasty at the airport."}
{"text":"Love this place! The Scottsdale one has much larger chicken legs then the one on central unless it just happened to be a big chicken day. HAHA They just came out with a new menu and there are so many things I want to try but the Chicken and waffles are so darn good I end up getting those every time.  I have tried the sweet potatoes and they were really good too. Always too full for dessert but OMG they look good!
Inexpensive pricing, fast service and they are open on Mondays too!"}
{"text":"Good food but terrible service. Will go back but paying with cash not credit so were not force to pay gratuity for terrible service!!!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I was here. I'm really impressed because it looks like they recently remodeled. The service was a quite efficient considering how packed it was.

The food was great and well priced. I had the Big Azz fish sandwich and fries. The portions were insane! I never had a sandwich as large anywhere else."}
{"text":"I used to come here a while ago, and it was great, now it seems almost as if everything is rushed, I got the wrong order 2 times, which is very unfortunate, however, my wages had enough time to tell me that what I got is what I ordered knowing IM allergic to seafood, and I had shrimp on my plate, was a high concern, I don't know when I will be returning"}
{"text":"Amazing food, fun atmosphere!  We went on a Saturday night so there was a DJ playing music too. Because they are so popular be prepared to wait to be seated and for your food but just chill cause it's worth the wait. :-)"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, spacious and loved the decor. Really nice staff and plenty to choose from on the menu for whatever you were in the mood for. There were also a few healthy options. The wait time to get the food was a bit long. Saw others complaining about it too. Overall good. I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Boo on the Food! This place is way over hyped. They tried to charge $7 for a little waffle and 2 cold, greasy chicken thighs. Not impressed at all. The only reason it gets 2 stars is because the waiter was nice and the place looked cool. 

First impressions are everything, so they say, and in this instance I would agree. Since moving here over a year ago I have heard people go on and on about Lolo's chicken and waffles, especially when they find out I moved from the south. \"Oh it is the best soul food\", \"They have the best fried chicken I have had anywhere..\" are some of the things people have said. We live in Mesa and there is not a location near us but this morning  we were running errands in Phoenix and drove about 15 minutes out of our way so I could finally try this place that so many people have raved about. The place was decorated nice, it was not too long after they opened and it was not busy, we were seated right away. Took about 10 minutes before we saw a server, our drinks were brought out fairly quick and our order taken. Our food came out pretty quick but what difference does quick service make when the food is cold? The skin on the chicken was not even crisp on the edges, they had obviously been sitting around for a while. I tried a bite anyway, good fried chicken is good hot or cold and this was not good. It had the overwhelming taste of flour and I think the cook forgot to put seasoning on it at all. When the waiter came over to check on us I told him the chicken was cold and I didn't want it, at first he took the plate back and didn't say anything at all, when he brought the check he apologized. I have heard people say how good it is and maybe my experience is isolated but if it really was an uncommon experience then why didn't the waiter seemed surprised when I returned it? Why didn't he offer to get me a fresh plate? Why didn't a manager come over to see what they problem was or to apologize? Maybe they are used to serving sub-standard food, that is the only thing I can think of. This place reminds me of a lot of places that were really good until they got popular, quality of food and service goes down, prices go up and the only reason they stay in business is because they are \"cool\" or trendy. 

Bottom line - Don't think I will try this place again, there are so many really good restaurants to try in the Phoenix area and when you are going to spend an average of $10+  per person to sit down & eat somewhere, the food should at least be fresh. 

Oh yeah, one more thing, a glass jar of kool-aid should never cost $3, unless you get to take the jar with you."}
{"text":"When we first walked in. (Party of 5). They said it was a 20 minute wait which is fine since they were really busy. 

They actually were able to sit us down within 5 minutes of waiting. 

Shortly after being seated. 
The server came to table and took our order and answer all our question. 
She was very friendly and also gave great recommendations and food and drinks. 

Over the service and food was amazing and would  definitely be returning to Lolos soon!"}
{"text":"To start off on a good note the chicken was good. This is the only reason it gets 2 stars. The rest of the food was ok and very over priced. The service was some of the worst I have every received. The hostest was so unfriendly and down right rude. We sat at the bar while we waited for our table, the bartenter wasn't much friendlier. We asked to speak with a manager because of the rude service and the bartender said he was the manager. When the concern was brought to his attention he made excuses for her and said she has a tough job. Never apologized.  My wife and I are very friendly people and the service was so awful. The server also was lacking people skills. It doesn't matter how good the food is (its just alright) the service alone will keep me away for good. I will give a place a second chance but the fact every employee made you feel unwelcome was to much for me. When the unpleasantness was brought to the staffs attention there were no apology but they made excuses. Don't bother at this place, you can get good chicken elsewhere."}
{"text":"First time I've been here. We had a party of 5 and sat outside. Perfect weather. Our server Jerri was super sweet . She even split our checks and informed us there would be gratuity added to our check (most servers don't tell you).  Food was yummmm!!!! I got the Betty boop with a side of mac and cheese. Even ordered some to go it was that good!! The chef came out and introduced herself and wished us a happy new year! So nice I definitely recommend this place to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I were in town for spring training again and decided to treat ourselves to some chicken and waffles before we headed over to the ballpark.

We'd been here once before - not sure why I didn't review it before.  However, this time around, I resolved to write something when we got home.

The cool thing is you can now get a waitlist via Yelp.  Yay!  It was semi-accurate-ish.  The wait range was 1-11minutes.  However, upon walking in, it took a while for the hostess to come back. When she did, she checked us in and that's when our wait starts.  Thankfully, it was about 10 minutes.

We were seated outside which was pleasant enough.  Our server turned out to be a ray of sunshine - super polite and accommodating.  She was on top of her game - didn't forget a single thing and check in on us regularly.

Now to the food...definitely better than that chain-that-shall-not-be-named in LA, history be damned.  The food here tasted and smelled great.  Both hubby and I each ordered the Soul Food Platter and both got the smothered chicken (with gravy and onions).  He got buttered rice and coleslaw while I got the grits, a waffle and an extra side of two eggs. Everything hit the spot.  The waffle was amazing but I had to stop at half.  I ended up covering my grits with my over-medium eggs and dousing it with hot sauce - divine!

To start, we also got the catfish nuggets which were good...until you made use of Lolo's hot sauce and it just totally got kicked up a notch.

The meal really hit the spot and set us up for the rest of the day until dinner time.  

Only questionable things were how slowly the hostess moved and also some of the stuff needed cleaning...it was disconcerting that both hubby and my menu pages were all stuck together.  I guess that's the hazard of having syrup in your repertoire!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I love the food. I had chicken with a waffle, some gritz and potatoes and was just so good. The staff here definitely have a sense of humor which is awesome. Great atmosphere as well. It's a place that people should check out."}
{"text":"Butta...with extra butta.  My new favorite post first friday's hang out.  It's sure to soak up any linguring \"33\" from Sens or Kiltlifter from \"fate.\"  I found myself dipping or should I say soaking the waffles in the delicious maple surup and washing it down with a big glass of Kool-Aid.  I think the pictures provided offer a good representation of what you can expect to find when you dine at Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles."}
{"text":"Smothered Chicken is the bomb.  Reminded me of my Grandmothers.  Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Aunt Jemima and Colonel Sanders surely turn in their otherwise peaceful graves each passing day that lolo's chicken and waffle shack remains open.  

Not since Bernie Maddoff convinced millionaire investors to dole out their life savings has this type of massive Ponzi scheme gone unnoticed and even celebrated by so many blindly dolling out dollars based on a completely fabricated reputation.   Truth be told I'd rather donate money to Maddoff than spend another dime at this chicken chopshop.  

With that rant off my chest I will begin the tale of my misfortunes at lolo's...

Being a white, upwardly mobile slapdick professional I have admittedly limited notions of culture but nonetheless always liked the idea of visiting a chicken and Waffle House like the ones us fat Americans like to watch as they're glorified on food porn shows like \"diners and drives.\" 
Hence, I was really looking forward to interrupting the moments of quiet desperation that occupy the majority of my existence so that I may stuff my fat face with some really awesome chicken and waffles! Too much to ask? I think not!

I strolled into this dump with my buddy lulu (no relation to Lolo) who I convinced to come with me because of all the great reviews left by Yelptard nation (I still love you yelptards). We showed up at 3pm--strategically halfway between peak times at the trough.  Hoping to really dive in balls deep, we plopped down at the bar.  

5 minutes later we were finally greeted and ordered some overpriced jars of \"blue drank\".  I love lil Wayne but this stuff was horrible--tasted like the bastard children of the kool aide man raping a gaggle of blue otter pops--stirred gently with a homeless man's jock strap. 

That said, I was still happy to remain open minded.  I then had the blind audacity to order....wait for it....chicken and waffles (side of Mac and cheese).  Only An idiot like me would again assume this was the wise thing to order when both items are included in the restaurants namesake. 

35 long minutes and several inquiries into the whereabouts of our order later, our food finally emerged from the Awkwardly small food expeditor window opposite the bar.  

Underwhelming would be an understatement to describe my emotions as I took in the plate of food set in front of me nearly an hour after being seated.  It appeared deep fried pigeon parts had been mistakingly places in the stead of chicken while a flat, leggo my flaccid Eggo reject of a waffle occupied the other part of my plate.  

Still, blind optimism and the faith in Yelptard reviews kept me positive as I reached for a fork and lifted a few loads of Mac and cheese above my three chins and into my pie hole.  I reached for the jar of blue drank and mentally weighed the options of my new catch 22...I could chase the crap n cheese with blue drank--chasing one poison with another AND run the risk of looking like I just blew papa smirf....OR I could swallow my Mac n cheese along with my own pride and hope that the chicken and waffles redeemed the sins of my beverage and side order selections.  I chose the latter.  

Rather than hearing angels sing or feeling the welcome back embrace of smiling food Gods however, I tumbled deeper into the pits of culinary hell as I tasted the critically acclaimed chicken and waffles.  In short, they sucked.  

The next question a diner asks themselves is whether or not to speak up....I shamefully struggled with this is the same manner than I'm sure the aforementioned raped otter pops struggled with whether or not to report their sexual violation by the big jug of talking kool aide that seemed so harmless and like-able....

I decided to do the right thing and report the wrong doing.  I requested to speak to the manager....again, lolo's failed to deliver.  The assistant manger finally came over.   

I rarely complain in real life, in person at a restaurant or even on the hallowed pages of yelp but when I do, I attempt to do so with as much tact as possible to give folks the chance to make things right.  Imagine my fury then when this assistant manager deliberately addressed my feedback in a very quiet mouse fart quiet voice in an obvious attempt to conceal reality from the other F-tard diners present.  

While he acknowledged that the chicken was a little off he refused to address the undercooked waffle and instead of offering to replace the food, he graciously removed the blue drank from our bill. 

Thanks for nothing!

{"text":"I'm not sure if the owners have gotten greedy but the prices have gone up, a lot. I know we are talking Old Town Scottsdale but that doesn't mean you can rip people off, the thing is I could maybe bare the four dollar soda and nine dollar beer if the service was good. Waitress never put in our appetizer order and it took forever to get our beer, man the service is just awful and when you get your bill you feel like you just got taken advantage of. Seriously the chicken and waffles are always good but for my family and I, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Chicken, waffles and red drank!  This place is in a sketchy part of town.  We got to see a genuine crack addict come over and ask for some ice water.  There was about a 20 minute wait for a table.  The food is amazing.  The building itself is a dump.  It's an old junky building that doesn't even have character really.  It's simply a pile of sh*t.  But the food is amazing.  I suggest heading to the Scottsdale one.  The seasoning on the chicken is amazing, and the contrast with that and the sweet syrup on the waffles will be something you will crave after you eat here even one time."}
{"text":"What a strange combo.... but take it from a rookie, it is good.  The Kool-Aid is cool too.  It comes in a mason jar. The chicken has some of the best seasoning I have ever tasted.  Reminds me of  Johnny's seasoning salt.  This chicken puts KFC to shame.  Something about the combo with the waffles... the sweet and salty is a good contrast.  You will like it."}
{"text":"I went ot Lolo's this weekend with the Breakfast Club (thanks Monica!). It was, of course, a fun time, and the food was pretty good. I, of course, had chicken and waffles (what else?). I got the Betty Boop, which was a breast and a waffle. My waist line is not thrilled, but I was! The chicken was good, it had a good amount of crunchiness, but I wish the breading had more spices in it. A good way to fix that is using their delicious hot sauce. Surprising, the coffee here was very good as well. I will probably not come here often (my thighs can't afford it), but when I'm looking for a breakfast calorie splurge, this is a good place to go. 

PS our server was very nice and accommodating for our large group."}
{"text":"Ok this place was good. I got brunch (?) with the BF after visiting a coffee shop. There was a wait when we got there, the lady told us there was a fifteen minute wait, but it was really like a 40 minute wait. It was nice out though, so that's ok. We got sat and both ordered the betty boop and the BF ordered some grits too. The betty boop is a fried chicken breast and a waffle. The food came out quickly and was good. The waffle was sweet and substantial and the chicken was relatively tasty (could have been spicier) and the breading was good. Overall the food was good. So why only 3 stars? I thought it was really overpriced for what we got. Our bill came out to be a little over 20 dollars. I just feel like for the product used, it should not cost as much as it does. Also, I don't think they were properly staffed for a sunday morning. They had lots of open tables when we got there, yet we waited for 40 minutes. Also, the food was so heavy and I felt a little sick after eating it all (and I did eat it all....) Anyway, I think this place is good, but I'm not sure I would come back."}
{"text":"Oh Yum, oh yum, ooohh yummm : )
I've never tasted better homecooked fried chicken at a restaurant. and chicken with waffles... umm, you're kidding! The cornbread was on point too. Actually, my only issue was how much calories dat meal was packing! Let's forget bout the big splodge of butter on top my waffle that i mistakenly dived into thinking it was vanilla icecream.."}
{"text":"Yummmm. It's probably going to say how many time's i've checked in next to my review and it's kind of embarrassing but not really because Lo-Lo's is  awesome! It's always busy on Saturday and Sunday mornings but the wait is never very long and the food always comes out fast!

I typically order the Tre-Tre's and a side of cornbread which is the perfect amount of food. The fried chicken is consistently crispy and the waffle is not too fluffy.  I've tried the grits too! Everything comes with heaps of butter so be prepared!

I've definitely gone more than 5 times and its really weird how two or three people always ask what you want to drink..even when you've already been helped but other than that, no complains about the service!"}
{"text":"All I can say is excellent in every aspect.  The fried chicken is mouth watering, the waffles are the best I have had, and the red kool aid is so damn good!  I don't know how they make the red kool aid like they do, but it's the best.  The service is always friendly and fast, and I have ate here numerous times.  I have never once had bad food or a bad experience.  Thank god I found this place in phoenix."}
{"text":"My first time going to Lolo's. I've heard a lot about it and it far exceeded my expectations, looking forward to my next trip back this weekend. :) 

Had their classic chicken and waffles, delicious and moist chicken &crispy waffles it's a must have!! Service was great, food came quick. Really enjoyed it all! It really reminded me of a home cooked meal, fresh, tasty comfort food. Must try!! Can't speak for other lolo's locations, but I'd definitely suggest this one"}
{"text":"This sh*t right here... This sh*t right here??? These waffles. This chicken. Those chili cheese fries. Trash!! Absolute garbagé!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat!  The chicken and waffles are so good. Fast service and the staff is extremely friendly. I could literally eat there everyday!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast at Lo-Lo's in Scottsdale today. The chicken and waffles were good, chicken better than the waffles, but my husband had the gizzards and gravy over rice. My, my, what a delicious dish. Don't think they are used to people drinking coffee, as we had to wait for the pot to brew when we got there and then had to ask for more and waited a long time for that. No refills on any beverages were offered, but other than that the service was good. We joined friends, so sat for a long time chatting and they didn't seem to mind. I think we will be going back next month as everyone enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times. Love everything I have ever eaten here. They have recently revamped the breakfast menu and I like the new choices. Only thing I don't like is the mandatory valet parking, not the Ritz Carlton people!"}
{"text":"WE went here for mother day, yes I am late in writing this review. It being mother's day the wait was long. That is ok, they had the basketball game on and Mom was happy! 
The waffles and chicken were very good.I believe that the whole menu will be good. I deceid to go with the dish that gave them their name and fame. The waffles have a Cinnamon, flavor that is not overpowering. 

They sell t-shirts and I bought myself and daughter and Mom one."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and loved it. We were seated right away. The waitress came
Over and took our order. I ordered the Betty Boop, which is a fried chicken breast and one waffle. My boss ordered a Betty Boop as well, and his wife ordered biscuits and gravy. We were served our drinks in large mason jars. I ordered Pepsi, and my boss ordered... Wait for it... Red Kool Aid!!! I thought that was awesome! So southern! The food came out about 10 minutes after ordering and it looked mouthwatering. The chicken was fried just right, and the waffle was so good! Next time
I want to try the biscuits and gravy... If I ever come back to Phoenix in the near future. We also had a side of green beans, and they were delicious. They had a southern Cajun kick to them, but it was so tasty. Not too spicy. Prices are good, not too expensive and the food portions are fulfilling! I left here satisfied!"}
{"text":"I have two issues with this place. One the music is way to loud for a Sunday Morning breakfast. I don't mind soul and R and B but not so loud a normal conversation is no possible. The second issue is no soy or almond milk for coffee. In this day and age keeping alternative milk on hand should be a given. This is at the Central ave location. If they had the milk and if they lower the music I would give it 5 stars instead of 3."}
{"text":"Disappointed! Very disappointed! Used to love love this place . Loved the fried chicken and the waffles . No quality control anymore . The chicken meat was dry lacking any moisture and the outside lost most of the crunch, likewise the sad waffle which in happier days had been crisp and tasty was now merely doughy . Their two signature items have totally lost their crunch and flavor . What a Shame ! 

The servers friendly , but the starter of fried green tomatoes was ordered immediately when we sat down and took 45 minutes to arrive , and before  we could take our first bite the dinner was on the table . Bad! We clearly wanted a starter ! 

Opening too many locations has caused Lolo 's to lose their crunch . Don't bother going ..  at least this location the food has gone soggy ."}
{"text":"After traversing appx 1,500 miles in a couple days, we were famished...

What else can fill a couple fatasses better than fried chicken, waffles, soda, and kool aid on warm Friday morning at bout 11am.

Yep... Ventured to Arizona's version of Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles and they did not disappoint.

Why Roscoes? Because i love their food. THe waffle is thick, with flavor rather than the crunchy thin crusts that many folks adhere too. There will much comparison to Roscoe because the other chicken and waffle places like Mrs. Bea's kinda suck...

Service:
Stephen was our host and server, and he was great. One of the best servers my limited life has the privilege of experiencing. He was on top of everything, constantly asking if we needed stuff. Keep in mind, it was super hectic at this hour and he just hustled. It got to a point where I can't even ask for anything because he asked first or was bringing it out... At the end of the day, he shaked our hands, and thanked us, and wished us a wonderful time in the 602. I was amazed how excellent the service was. Of course, with the exception to the skinny waiter/host at Roscoes LBC, the service tends to suck pretty bad.

Chicken:
It tasted similar to Roscoe, even the menu had similar attributes. Nice and fluffy. 

Lolo's Hot sauce:
Pretty damn good. Had a nice cajun bite opposed to Tabasco's vinegarette base or the pepperish mexican chiles. 

Waffle:
Decent flavor but not as thick. I didn't particularly care for the waffles too much.

Kool Aid:
LOL sugar and water, what can go wrong? THis day, they had red, blue, and green. Obviously, i indudged in the OG red. Upon asking to try the green, Stephen, asked if I have tried the Suicide. 

Suicide: Bottom was lemonade with blue, green, and red kool aid topped off with sprite. No Mixing!!!! and it was great... Perfect thirst quencher for the Arijona heat...

Overall I was pleased with the overall experience, from the courteous valet dude(s) all the way to the kool aid and bill. 

So far, my time in Arizona was met amazing friendliness. I was a bit concerned with the various news media on hobunk Arizona towns and their disdain for minorities portrayed by all types of media. That shit is so untrue. I love these little country/hicktowns =D

All the country white folks in Arijona, from Buckeye all the way down to whack ass Bisbee was nothing but pleasantry, howdy y'll, smiles, and excellent hospitality. 

Lolo's and Cracker Barrel. I have never experienced such wonderful hospitality. 
Funny thing is, both places are completely different cultures, but still very pleasant to patronize."}
{"text":"The building is adorable, brick wall warehouse feel. Complimentary valet is also nice. OH & they gave me my beer in a paper bag, hood style, which was pretty cool.

As far as the food, I should have just ordered appetizers because my meal was horrible!

Appetizers included fried pickles, fried green tomatoes, & fried corn fritters. All of which were delicious.

I ordered the veggie plate which was just a ton of bland food.

Service was slow, our orders were wrong, and overall the food is nothing special but very overpriced.

I don't think I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"Pros:
-Great tasting kool-aid, but then again, how could you go wrong with making kool-aid...?
-Very nice staff

Cons:
-Slow service if you sit outside. You're pretty much forgotten by the wait staff
-Don't order the cornbread - its extremely dense and hard, not the soft, buttery kind

I know the crowd will boo when they read this, but seriously folks - their chicken and waffles tastes like KFC chicken with Ego waffles - anybody feel me on this?! What is so special about their stuff? I say take your money and buy you're own bucket of fried chicken for the same price. Sorry!"}
{"text":"I come to Lo-Lo and what do I try? Lo-Lo (it's named after this place afterall)

So I got an order of the Lo-Lo (chicken and waffles) and the stupid fries.

Stupid fries came out first, it's interesting since it has gravy with it. Not bad - I like it.

Okay - so this is the millionare dollar question: How's the Lo-Lo?

I think it's just okay, I don't see what's so special about it. It's just a big piece of waffle, it's not especially crispy or anything. It's soft and soggy. If you like your waffles like that, then maybe it fits you better than for me. The fried chicken was definitely crispy so that's good. It wasn't flavorful though. It just tasted deep fried. I think KFC and Churchs chicken taste better. I rather buy KFC or Church chicken and make my own waffle with my waffle machine and eat it. 

It's a little bit on the saltier end for the chicken but it didn't bother me too much.

The service here can be nice but when they are attentive, the wait staff is extremely courteous and kind! They let us move to a bigger table because we didn't have enough room on our small table for all our food.

Last point...if you've been to Roscoes, it reminds me of Roscoes but I think it MIGHT be cheaper than Roscoes."}
{"text":"Great delicious food. Consistently horrible counter service. Needs more training and additional counter help."}
{"text":"Their Koolaid drinks are killer! Literally diabetes in a glass, but the alcoholic ones are the ones I will splurge for absolutely amazing!! I highly recommend you get one. Then I love their rotisserie chicken, obviously not the most popular dish on the menu but every bite is simply amazing and it's a bit healthier than its fried counterpart. However their chicken and waffles combo is also pretty tempting! I love Roscoes way more, but this is still great for Arizona. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but, as a vegetarian, it's very difficult to get food here. I knew that going in so I didn't expect that much different than what I got but all of my friends absolutely love the food!"}
{"text":"Good tasting food, but way over priced.  If you would like to go for the experience, feel free.  But if it's because you are hungry, you'd do better to just grab something from Popeyes or KFC."}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed on a Monday  on 10/30 at 9:15pm and the petite Hispanic hostess asked what time it was and we said 9:15. And she said they were closed. We were under the impression they closed at 10pm and she said no we are not we are closing early. Me and my 2 roommates really enjoy LoLos Chicken but we can go down the street to Bushs Chicken were they more than happy to serve us and I think we found a new chicken place! I hope management can fix this issue because I don't know how many customers they lose a night doing this. But they lost 3 that night. P.s I still love your collard greens!"}
{"text":"Lolo's what happened??!!!!!! So disappointed, 1st off only way to park is by valet??!! Sorry valet dude, wasn't expecting your new location to not have ANY self parking and didn't have any cash on me!!! :( 
And since when did you start serving INSTANT grits!!!!!  Next I'm going to hear that your Mac n cheese is made with velveeta cheese! Yuck!!!!'"}
{"text":"I walk in and ask to place a order to go and she says no the kitchen is backed up. Rude no customer service at all never had any place tell me that no matter how busy they are"}
{"text":"I heard about this restaurant and had to try it.  Did not disappoint.  The parking lot was full and there was a wait to eat on a Monday at 2:00.  It was worth it!  Unbelievable fried chicken, waffles were amazing & the sides..,,WOW!  My husband went back the next time he was in town and brought home food to eat family style for the rest of us.  No leftovers."}
{"text":"When I first heard about this place months ago, I never thought I would be interested.  I don't like southern or fried foods.  Then I saw a write up in the newspaper where people voted on their chicken versus some fried chicken from some fancy place....and it was pretty much a split decision.  The descriptions of the food made me want to try it.  

So we went last night (Friday night) for the first time to the Scottsdale location.  It was busy, but we we still sat immediately.  I was starving and the smell was wonderful!  I ordered the Betty Boop (one waffle and one breast) and Sierra Mist.  They do not serve alcohol here.  It comes in a huge mason jar.  I tasted the Kool Aid which was yummy too!  We also ordered the macaroni and cheese.

The chicken and waffles came out first.  The mac and cheese didn't come out until we were almost halfway done with our meal, which was a little strange.

The fried chicken was absolutely amazing!!  It was perfectly cooked.  The chicken was so tasty.  The fried part isn't overwhelming and greasy.  I am definitely a fan of fried chicken now! 

The waffle was good, nothing special, but the sweetness did complement the saltiness of the fried chicken.

I wouldn't order the mac and cheese again.  It was a small portion in case you are thinking of sharing.  But it was too cheesy for my liking.

I liked that the manager came around and asked how our meal was.  She seemed to genuinely care what we thought of it.

I liked the food so much that I went again the next day with my two daughters!  The place is kid-friendly, although there is not a kid menu.  I ordered both of them full plates, which I probably shouldn't have.  They could have easily shared one.  They loved it as well--and the kool aid!

I would definitely recommend this place!  I never thought it would be somewhere I would like, but I will definitely go back.  Best chicken ever!

And cute t-shirts too..."}
{"text":"My meal was great! I ordered wings, mac and cheese, greens and cornbread. The wings weren't greasy and everything was flavorful. My overall experience is rated 4 stars because of the long wait to be seated, inattentive waitress and music that seemed a bit too loud."}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying this place and so far it has been the best part of my trip (besides seeing my family of course, lol).  The food was excellent, prices were reasonable, and the service is outstanding.  I got the number 10, which had two chicken legs and one waffle, plus I added a side of mac and cheese.  The chicken was awesome.  Not too much breading.  The waffle was light but crispy.  Put those two together and it was perfection.  The mac and cheese was overcooked, but it still had good flavor.  I will probably try another side next time.  Overall, it was a great and everyone in my group walked away with a great experience. We went for lunch and we are considering going back for dinner!"}
{"text":"This place was INCREDIBLE!! We got to LO-LO's at about 11am. We ordered and within 2 min we where eating. The portion sizes are very very big. You could share a plate. I had the BABY RAY, 3 piecec of fried chicken with onions and gravy and waffles. GREAT GREAT GREAT. I cannot say enough about this place. The only down side was LOCATION, we ate at the downtown location. If you are scared or think you are too good you can go to Scottsdale, BUT A MUST GO EAT!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here on opening day at the newest location so service was quite slow however the food was hot and fresh when we received it.  I tried it again a couple of days later and it was a much better experience.  Can't really go wrong with chicken and waffles along with a sweet, cold mason jar of sweet tea to wash it down!"}
{"text":"I called to phn in a order . Was greeted on the phn (Cecelia) who was obviously new and didn't know the menu so I asked to speak to the other girl who I felt would know the menu so she then puts the phone down the. The background music seems to get louder then all of a sudden the phone slams down then I called back got a hold of Jesse then I asked for the mgr then on came I then spoke to Antwan (mgr) who wasn't too helpful . This was so unprofessional . I've never had this happen NEVER will I ever come back to LoLos or allow anyone I know to support them.  Iam a recording artist so I don't always have time to eat and do things like this and the time I do this mess happens . Wow -Dallas"}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed this restaurant! Food was very good seasoned perfectly and fast. All the staff was super friendly and the environment was overwhelming welcoming. Music was on point too! I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"LoOks chicken had the most delicious chicken and found in the valley.  Sometimes menus and takeout is so confusing to me but Azarel made returning so simple and easy.  I really appreciate the way he explained all the many choices and their various costs. I was sitting and waiting for a minute when a young lady asked me if I wanted a menu.  Someone else met me adding as I walked in and directed to where I should wait for takeout. Thank you.  Not stars  because very expensive. The only problem was I asked for gravy  on the side and got potatoes with gravy mixed in. Did I misunderstand?"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed after reading the great reviews.

Very average.  Denny's would have been as good.

 The fried okra was bland with no seasoning.  The waffle was OK, the chicken breasts were bland and dry.  The sweet tea was fruity not sweet. The chili tasted as though it came out of a can and then had hot sauce liberally applied.  The food was hot though.
The service was quick and so was the check.  The check had items on it that we did not order.  I thought the prices were really high.  $37 for two at lunch without cocktails.

After the reviews, I had to try it but will not be back."}
{"text":"Omg - the chicken is so good!!! Perfectly cooked and great flavor.  Cheesy grits are outstanding.  And I LOVE they have kool aid on tap."}
{"text":"Really good food here. Excellent Fried Chicken and Collards. The corn bread rocks too. Lovely friendly owners. The food comes out fast. Be clear and ask for white meat if you want it. For the price of a 3pc meal, I feel that at least one piece of white meat should be included. Its hit and miss here. Some days yes some days no. So ask."}
{"text":"I'd give it 5 stars if I had more experience with chicken and waffles.  But I enjoyed my visit to Lo Lo's.  Chicken was moist and flavorful.  Waffle was crispy.  I also had the rice and beans and gravy on the side.  Made my trip to Phoenix more memorable.  There were 6 of us in our group and no one complained.  Cornbread and fries were tasty too. 

I would return when in the area."}
{"text":"We got there at 9 am, Sunday morning and got seated right away.  The food was awesome!  I had waffles, egg and grits and it was delish!  My daughter is almost 3 and she was eating more than I was and she's a picky eater so trust me, if she eats it it must be good.  I would definitely return.  Service rocked.  Lemonade was a bit on the sweetside but everything was great. TY"}
{"text":"There's something special about a thin, fluffy waffle (not a Belgian one) smothered in butter and syrup, wrapped around a perfectly fried and crispy piece of southern fried chicken. When your licking your tasty, sticky fingers because you want more and more, and  Larry \"Lo-Lo\" White himself comes over with his chubby belly and jovial laugh and says, \"syrup and butter make everything better,\" all you want to do is add more to shove down your pie hole. This is the place to do it. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu but my fave is always #3, Lo-Lo's, 3 piece southern fried chicken with 2 \"golden\" waffles. Oh, and get the Kool-Aid, always on tap. Just add more water - that shite is sweet!!

Okay that's enough. Get your ass up, head to Phoenix, wait on line and keep our mouth shut until you get that friggin' dish in front of you."}
{"text":"I'm pullin' an Al Bundy on the couch after dining at LoLo's.  You know - he sits on the couch, slouched with his hand down the front of his pants to give more room to his gut.  That's me right now, only with WAY better hair.
Had the #10.  Because I'm a 10, get it?  Two chicken legs with a waffle.  I went with Julia T., Jason W., Nathan S., Amanda B., and David SB tonight.  We all ordered different sides so we could share.  Our end of the table shared the collard greens , mac and cheese and candied sweet potatoes.
The platter of chicken and waffles arrived.  You should see the scoop of butter on the waffle!  A scoop!  Not a pat!  The chicken legs were perfectly done - moist, not greasy, with an awesome coating that wasn't too much.  The waffle was perfectly crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  I'm glad it came with syrup, not maple syrup.  I detest maple anything.  I lived in New England too long.
Nathan leaned over and suggested we pretend we were making an Ice Cube movie, Babershop-style, and pick an actor to play each of us.  I was Angela Bassett, of course.  
Collard green were yummy!  Not over-cooked, with hunks of the stems thrown in.  The sweet potatoes were pretty sweet, but not overly so.  Mac and cheese?  Yes, please! (that rhymed!)  And the tea.  Ohhhhhh the tea.  I got the half and half sweet.  I figured there was enough sugar in my meal that I didn't want to bounce off the walls and crash like a 4-year old after Halloween.  I had two huge glasses - actually, jars.  It's served in Kerr canning jars.  The big ones.  It was so good (How good was it???) that as I got up from my corner seat and walked around to leave, I reached over to take one last huge swig.  
I'm full.  Not Thanksgiving-dinner full, but properly sated after a meal at LoLo's.  
The company rocked and I couldn't have asked for a more pleasant dinner crowd!  
(p.s. We pegged Whoopie to play Julia.  Ha!)"}

{"text":"I love the large lemon Aid with the fried Catfish to wash it all down."}
{"text":"All I can say is- YES YES YES! I was hesitant at first to try it out because the thought of chicken with waffles.. And syrup poured over didn't sound too enticing but HOLY COW! I crave it everyday now! I need my chicken and waffles with the purple drank!!"}
{"text":"bomb.com

Brings me back to my days living in LA from eating at Rosco's. You cant go wrong with chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"Smack your mama good food. Found this place by accident and it was the best accident of the year. Their service isn't great, but the food.is so good you won't notice."}
{"text":"Quality has gone down drastically unfortunately. Had them twice in the past year, both times having it delivered through a service like UberEATS or postmates. It was just ok, the chicken wasn't crispy, kind of soggy and greasy. The cornbread and sides are good but the chicken should be the star!"}
{"text":"Food=4.5 stars 
Location=2

I had been to the original location (pre-expansion) quite a few times, but this was my first try at the Scottsdale location.  It was CRAZY packed.  I tried going at 2pm on a Sunday, and there was not a single empty table...anywhere.  We were seated after a 30 minute wait, but we were so cramped that the whole experience was lackluster.  I will take the original location any day over the Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"I cannot live without Lo-Lo's.  It is INSANE.  Juicy, juicy chicken, crispy waffles....mind blowing.  I alternate between the Betty Boop and the Tre Tre.  I actually prefer their dark meat as I find it tastier.  Either way though, you can't go wrong.  Skip the Scottsdale location and go to the OG place on Yuma.  Oh..and get the sweet tea! Tooth rot in a jar, but so good!"}
{"text":"I've had take out and just went there for lunch. Food is awesome. Just some good ole southern comfort food done well. I will say this the place is packed and normally is. We had about a 15 minute wait at lunch time which isn't too bad. This isn't your normal place you would figure for chicken and waffles. It's actually quite fancy, they have valet parking and a nice outdoor seating area while you wait for your table. We also had an excellent server. They are all hustling in an efficient manner. Everything done pretty well at this place. I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"LoLo's chicken & waffles is one of my favorite places to eat in Arizona. I always order the lil amadi, sometimes i'll add a cornbread to the side, or maybe even an extra waffle! The grape kool aid is my favorite but i'm no stranger to the red one too. At first I was a little distraught entering the neighborhood, but now I'm here getting my lil amadi probably once or twice a month! Shits too good.

{"text":"CAUTION!!!!!!! Take a picture of your signed receipts here! Waiters/Waitresses like to over charge your card with a larger tip.... I know this because it happened to me unfortunately. Management was very unapologetic and made it seem like it was my fault that I didn't give the waitress a 30% tip...hmmm. I am still waiting for the management to return the excess money to my card. I guess that's what happens when little restaurants flourish. They get MONEY HUNGRY!! I doubt my little yelp review will damage the business in any way, but I feel like I would be doing a disservice not to warn my fellow consumer. Word to the wise...check your bank statements after visiting here...you might end up with an extra expense for GREED!"}

{"text":"This was honestly my best meal in Arizona! Came in here before my morning flight and wasn't expecting much considering that it's an airport restaurant but thankfully this place delivered! The chicken, waffles and fries were all honestly amazing. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for some quick food before their flight."}
{"text":"The Kool-Aid hit the spot; nice and cold in a mason jar.  We were told the wait would be 30-45 minutes today when we arrived at 11:45 am (It's a Thursday.)  The wait ended up being only 10 minutes, but, after having eaten there, I would have waited the full 45.  My macaroni and cheese was great.  The cornbread, although a bit dry, totally hit the spot with the Kool-Aid.  The waffles and eggs (I ordered the \"Lil Jay\") were both hot and fresh and delicious.  Amazing!  I can't imagine a better place to eat in Phoenix.  Very inexpensive, and I took home my left-overs for later, because I won't waste a crumb of this delicious-ness!"}
{"text":"I had read a great review and my longtime customer son raved about LoLo's, so it's been on my 'must do' list for a while. Finally made it on my most recent visit to Phoenix and I wasn't disappointed.  
It's extremely popular now but that hasn't spoiled the upbeat and organized service, and, most importantly, the great food. The servings are very generous and very delicious.  The valet parking is a brilliant idea both because of limited parking options and for those nervous about leaving the 'burbs and treading into South Phoenix (am I dating myself?)
Thanks for a great experience.  I look forward to my next visit soon!

{"text":"What is wrong with people?  This place is amazing.  The waffles are flavorful and complement very nicely with their fried chicken.  Adding some butter on the waffles.  Then put on the syrup with the chicken on in.  Don't forget the gravy and a little ketchup if you will.  Maybe get it with an egg, and get the yokes to on through it.  Or you can cut the chicken up so you can make yourself a taco out of this scrumptious combination.  I also had a delicious Bloody Mary to go with the chicken and waffles so that I could get vegetables into this meal.  There are other ways to get vegetables if that's your thing too.  You can get something with something something on the side IDK CHECK THE MENU.  I'M STICKING WITH THE CHICKEN N WAFFLES.  This is a great place to go on a cheat day with your diet, just to get the sugar salts cravings reconciled.  The service is fantastic.  They commit to excellence with the scorecard they give you and that's a nice touch.   It's a shame this fine"}

We waited about 10 minutes to get in; sat down and received water and coffee, 5 minutes later put in our order and received our food within ~7 minutes.  We ate and chatted.  As soon as we got the bill the young gal said we needed to hurry and leave because there were customers waiting for seats.  To boot the food wasn't that good either."}
{"text":"Soul food wasn't even on my radar when I thought about eating in Phoenix but a friend of ours recommended this place and it didn't disappoint. I got the smothered chicken. Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside and the gravy had a nice peppery kick. Lolos also was able to restore my wife's faith in shrimp and grits. She hadn't tried it since we had a bad experience in New Orleans but got brave enough to have it here and was very pleased with it. The grits were creamy just like she likes them and the shrimp and sauce were excellent. I hear it gets busy later on in the day but we went for lunch and were seated right away. Don't be scared by the hype. This place is the real deal"}
{"text":"Delish! Chicken&Waffles but with drum sticks HELL FCKN YEA BISH!! Oh and a side of sun side up eggs, Catch it!"}
{"text":"Although I was a little dissapointed in the lack of real soul food the customer service and quality of the food here more than make up for it. I had ordered food and it wasn't really all that warm so I asked my server if the kitchen could reheat it. She came back a few min later with brand new chicken!"}
{"text":"Location is close to downtown Scottsdale, next door to Jamba Juice and Subway. I was excited to eat here until I recieved my chicken and greens after tasting. I felt like, Jessica Simpson \"Is this chick or is this fish?\" The chicken taste like fish batter, or either deep fried in the same grease as fish. I was chomping on Fishken. The greens were good, except they taste like broiled in chicken stock. I'm use to eating greens broiled in neckbone/and or hamhock therefore all the natural flavor from the meat is used as a stock. Cornbread was very delish. I would return if the chicken didn't taste like fish..."}
{"text":"Love the food but the wait time is ridiculous during the lunch hour.  Twice now I've come in for lunch only to wait 20 minutes just to get up and ask someone what happened to my drink order.  45 mins to find out what happened to the food!  AGAIN love the food but would love if Lolo's were a little more mindful of their customers and their time."}
{"text":"Just okay. I was surprised, however, to find such a large Breakfast Waffle Sandwhich and it went beyond my expectations, although very slightly.

Like other Yelpers, I waited longer than I expected from an airport eatery. Chefs were taking there time, as was the cashier. Folks are usually rushing in airports, but not here, and definetly not catering to the \"flying public\". 

Are you serious? Step it up a bit, and perhaps the average food, generous serving size aside, will be overlooked."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Scottsdale and Lo-Lo's, I came to town for a family reunion.  

My husband and I came to Lo-Lo's straight from the airport.  By the time we arrived, everyone in my party was already seated and had ordered/eaten. They pulled another table over so we could all sit together as a group.

I noticed the entrees were sizable. Since my aunt had more than half of her shrimp and grits entree left, I just ended up eating part of her meal.  I've never had shrimp and grits prepared in that fashion (the shrimp were fried and the tails left on) but it was pretty good.  My husband ended up ordering the chicken and waffles - this came with 3 big pieces of chicken and 2 waffles. Unfortunately the chicken was a little dry, but the waffles were good.  He also had scrambled eggs and bacon. He did not finish his meal since it was a lot of food, and he opted not to take the leftover piece of fried chicken to-go since it wasn't that great.  

We also ordered an appetizer of catfish which I thought was good.

Service was slow but pleasant nevertheless. I asked for water with no lemon, she came back with water with lemon.  I requested again and gave back the water.  This time she came back with the same cup, the lemon was gone but there was lemon visibly floating around in the cup.  I don't like to send things back (especially after asking twice) so my husband ordered another water with no lemon, then he took my glass and drank some.  He confirmed he could taste the lemon.

Silverware was not particularly clean, nor was the place that clean looking while I was there (food remnants on floor, chairs, etc).

Overall a decent meal."}
{"text":"Can I just say Lo-Lo's, you complete me!!
 Seriously love this place! I could probably have chicken and waffles for breakfast, lunch and dinner if my arteries and waistline would allow it! But that's why coming here is a treat, true soul food!
Chicken is full of flavor and moist and sits right on a perfect golden waffle! I`m also a fan of their Red Drank which is so refreshing especially for summer!!
Love me some Lo-Lo's!!"}
{"text":"Lo-Lo`s:You had me at chicken and waffles!! A first for me trying this and damn I`m gonna be back for more!! Hardest part here was deciding what to order but I went with what I came for- Lo-Lo`s ( 3 pc fried chicken and waffles). Juicy and crisp,Heaven to my tummy!!  Also tried the red Kool aid drank! Yum!!

Like I said I plan to be back to try more delicousness  here, especially the red velvet cake!"}
{"text":"Perhaps some of the most terrible service I have received since moving to Phoenix. The staff is incredibly nice, but extremely incompetent."}
{"text":"We live close to Lolo's and I have been meaning to stop by and try their fried chicken. Everyone that I know who has tried this place is all saying the fried chicken is a must try. And so I did. And they were not wrong! I got 2 thighs and a waffle for $7 and I thought the chicken portion size was really huge. Customer service (the greeter) was also polite. I'd say I'm going back for another fried chicken craving next time!"}
{"text":"I eat at Lo-Lo's A LOT! I always get the Lo-Lo's chicken and waffles meal. It's enough that I can take some home for later. The chicken is fantastic-fresh, seasoned well, crispy, delicious. The waffles are good, not great, but that doesn't matter one bit. The service is outstanding! Even if something goes wrong with an order, they make up for it. Hey, nobody is perfect and they handle mistakes with class and to my complete satisfaction. I have been to the Central Ave location once but my favorite one is in Gilbert. I truly appreciate the quality service. It doesn't feel fake or forced but quite genuine. They make me feel truly welcome. And, they play Gospel music on Sunday!! This is my go-to when I have guests in town and they never fail to make the trip worth it! They get two thumbs up and a round the world snap behind the back!"}
{"text":"LoLo's doesn't quite have the filthy charm of Roscoe's in Los Angeles but it's right down the street from where I currently live and the food is pretty darn good. I managed to convince my skeptical friend to try it one massively hungover morning. She ordered neither a waffle or chicken but after she saw the table next to us get their chicken, she added a drumstick to her order. I got the same thing I got last time, the Betty Boop which is one chicken breast and one waffle. Their chicken is absolutely delicious, truly top notch. The waffles are also good but I like a bit of a thicker waffle, as they make theirs quite thin so it loses its crunch rather quickly once you pour syrup on it. 
Here is my only real problem with place (and thus minus one star): they have serious timing issues when bringing out food. The extra piece of chicken my friend ordered was the first thing to arrive. A couple minutes later my plate arrived. A couple minutes after that, the rest of my friend's food arrived. That is really annoying and not a good way to run a restaurant. The food should all be brought out at the same time. Period. Other than that, the service is good but they appear to take a team-style approach to service whereby you will have 4 to 5 different people taking care of your table. My advice: focus - one server per table, and get a food runner so that I am not confused as to who my waiter is and my food comes out at the same time. Overall, recommended, especially when hungover."}
{"text":"After several years, I finally got to go to the Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles in south Scottsdale (at their new location a bit north of their old location).

I think all of the rave reviews I'd heard from so many people ramped up my expectations. In truth, Lo-Lo's is a good family restaurant that has built up a loyal fan base that freely recommends its fare. That's not a bad thing at all.

I had a good, down-home meal and finally got to find out what grits are--nice. My eggs-over-easy with cheese and onions were tasty. The fried chicken crust was crunchy and tasted great, but the pieces were a bit on the small side. The waffles could have been more crisp.

The minor issues cited above might have dropped my rating to 4.51, but that still would round to a \"5.\" What dropped them below 4.50 was the slowness of bringing and refilling our water and the long wait for the food. I think we visited at the tail-end of their busy, post-church Sunday afternoon, but they should have been ready for that.

Overall, it's a good time and I'll visit again at some point."}
{"text":"Central location was Excellent! We all enjoyed our food. They are busy so you must allocate some time to spend there. There was a lot to select from, but our waiter steered us in the right direction. We will definitely visit again!!!"}
{"text":"To be fair I was recovering from an exhausting weekend full of bad food. I was tapped out. So eating fried chicken and waffles first thing in the morning was probably not my best move. The waffle was tasty. The chicken was greasy. The coffee was good. It wouldn't be my first recommendation for breakfast. It seems like one of those \"either you like it or you don't\" sort of things. I don't think I did. Would I try it again? If it were someone else's idea, probably."}
{"text":"I don't yelp I've never felt the need to but something this amazing I want to share. Celebrating a birthday and return from the army with my family we decided to go here...whenever my sister is on leave from the army we always go at least once before she reports back. Anyway this is not important what is is the fact that the collard greens were on point today so amazing so good slightly spicier than normal but amazing nonetheless. The catfish out of this world it was crunchy it wasn't murky absolutely perfect! Also important to the story you should know that I literally get paid to taste it is my job I'm a chef. Now here's what happened...I ordered the fried chicken and waffles for my children I tasted a piece of chicken because I noticed that they were not eating it and it tasted like peanut butter. Keep in mind that I am at a table with three adults and three children with one more adult also a chef on the way to join us. Working in the industry I called over my server and I mentioned it to him he went to the manager which is what you're supposed to do they tasted a different piece of chicken and proceeded to come and literally disrespect me in front of my whole family. The general manager told me that not only were my taste buds wrong but I should eat less peanut butter. Seriously eat less peanut butter? Now I sat there shocked but I told him the other adults also tasted the same thing he said they were wrong. Then the manager accuses me of actively looking for something to complain of in my meal to get free things. Keep in mind I didn't even order the chicken which he then mocked me for eating my kids food. I had catfish which I ate all of and it was amazing. Also keep in mind that I still proceeded to spend more money on a dessert and drinks but they decided to freeze out our whole table and we sat and waited for 25 minutes for our bill nobody came. When our other guests came to join no one came to take his order so he shared a water with me and ate the leftover food from the birthday girl. No one even acknowledged us we had to flag down another completely different server or maybe it was a busser to get our tab. I wish I would've recorded his response(manager) to me because it was that outlandish. So sadly my first yelp review ever is a terrible one."}
{"text":"5-Stars for the best Soul Food in the Valley!

I'm from the Deep South (Mississippi), and I've been craving soul food for years, so when a group of friends suggested we eat at Lo Lo's yesterday, I couldn't say no!

The Lo Lo's in Scottsdale is a nice, open restaurant that was VERY crowded at 2PM on Saturday afternoon.  Every group had a wait of at least 20 minutes.  

I had the special which included two pieces of fried chicken - a breast and a wing - a waffle with syrup and I ordered a side of cheese grits.

First, the waffle.  No one at waffles with fried chicken in Mississippi.  I think this soul food extension is an invention of Chicago, though I may be wrong.  The waffle was tasty, but nothing spectacular.  It was aight.

The chicken, though, was by far the best damned fried chicken I've had since I ate at a family-owned Cajun fried chicken place in Gonzales, Louisiana 15 years ago.  It was THAT good.  Generous pieces.  Fried to perfection.

The grits: these were REAL grits.  Not instant.  The good stuff.  The kind that takes a good while to cook.  It was perfect.  Man, I haven't had honest good grits in more than 15 years.  We'll be going back to Lo Los just because of grits if nothing else (though I really want more chicken).

Everyone's drinks came in gigantic glass mayonnaise jars.  Not too many of us needed refills.  A friend ordered fruit punch kool-aid (which they have ON TAP).  I could SMELL his kool aid from across the table.  He sad it was so strong, he probably went home with diabetes.  :D  They don't fool around with their kool-aid.

Service was fantastic.  Our waiter had an awesome shirt that said \"Scottsdale, but Hood forever\"  lol

We'll be going back as soon as we recover.  :D"}
{"text":"the food was only okay.... if you're in the mood for comfort food it would hit the spot. the fried chicken and the cornbread (baked sweet, just the way I like it) are good and if I came back I would order those. however, the waffle was disappointing :-/ it was flimsy and soft, whereas I like my waffles to be crispy on the outside and thicker.

the service here was OUTSTANDING. everyone from the hostess to the servers were extremely friendly and attentive and happily made us a custom drink (half sweet tea, half regular tea... bc the sweet tea alone is way too sweet!)."}
{"text":"Wow.  For a place that is known for fried chicken and waffles, I expected better.  Maybe I came at the wrong time?  But they weren't making the fried chicken to order, even though it wasn't busy.  I sat at the counter in front of the kitchen and saw the giant sheet tray full of pre-cooked chicken.  So, as expected, it had been sitting there awhile and was dry, dry, dry.  The waffle wasn't even that good, even though that was fresh.  Seriously don't understand what the hell everyone is thinking by going to this place.  KFC has better fried chicken than here - at least it's juicy."}
{"text":"They do a good job. Son of mrs. White's down in Phoenix that open this. I still prefer Roscoe's in Los Angeles over this spot but a good alternative one in Phoenix"}
{"text":"We were actually on our way to get some sushi and we spotted this place. We acted impulsive and decided to hit this spot instead. Now I'm a big fan of RC&W in Los Angeles and I've been to many of places that couldn't compare. We will see. I do like the look and they serve koo laid in a jar which is  pretty cool. We will see if they live up to what I expect. I mean I'm an avid chicken either, only because I was predisposed to loving chicken, being that I'm part African American n all :).


Well amazing service. Not a long wait at all. Pretty good portions as well. The chicken legs were big, almost like they ordered them from an obese chicken farm.The taste wasn't as good as RC&W but it's not bad. The mac n cheese is good. Overall, not a bad place."}
{"text":"Lolo's has been a go to for me for years! Although I will always remember and be fond of the original restaurant the revamped image is nice as well! The food is good and the Kool aide is amazing!! The only downfall is that they get very busy and don't handle the traffic very well.. the waiting staff could use some training on how to turn tables and get more customers and money through the doors. On occasion the chicken was pretty dry as well. Overall I like the place and will continue to stop in (off peak hours of course).."}
{"text":"First time ever in this place and from the start till the end we had amazing experience. The greater was super nice, their staff walks around and talks with people and they make sure everyone have great experience. The food was delicious and can't complain. We ordered chicken tenders with waffle and it was great. What I love about this place that they have variety food and anyone can enjoy this place. Thank you everyone for great experience."}
{"text":"Ive been to it all. Anyplace that sells chicken and waffles, even the famous one on TV. THIS IS THE BEST CHICKEN AND WAFFLE PLACE on the west coast. Hands down.

1) Best seasoned fried chicken
2) Best flavored waffle. Slight taste of cinnamon, crisp edges.
Put this together with some syrup and you got heaven on a fork!
3) Best Mac and Cheese - not gooey and smothered in cheese. Nice firm texture
4) BEST CORN BREAD - besides some of the homemade cornbreads I've had, they make a bomb as cornbread perfect with a little butter on top. 
5) Cornmeal breaded catfish, I never pass up on this. If I dont get one in my meal I definitely order it on the side
6)You have to try the CHYNA'S HONEY HOTS. My god, no one makes sweet hot wings like this. Ugh, makes my mouth water. 
7) Kool-aid..... need I say more. Red blue and purple are the flavors. They make it perfectly sweet. 

They recently got some new stuff on their menu that I haven't gotten to. But the items above have always been on their menu and I always order them. Its a must. 

Check out the original location in downtown phoenix. I think the chicken at the downtown spot is a little more better than the scottsdale location but I'm not buggin. Its just a lot smaller than the scottsdale location."}
{"text":"By far the best place for some chicken and waffles with a nice tall mason jar full of red Kool-Aid!

While some may say the location isn't the best [okay, it can seem pretty sketchy after dusk], the food is amazing!  I usually get the Betty's Boob[a waffle and a breast] and some mac & cheese if I'm feeling extra hungry.  The waffle is always crisp and delicious and the fried chicken is delicious.  Gotta love that savory-sweet combo of a syrup-y bite of waffle with a juicy bite of chicken.  *shivers*

The service is always friendly and this place is usually packed. Lo-Lo's definitely lives up to all their hype [don't go to the Scottsdale location though.  Totes not the same.]~!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of the Phoenix location but the past few times we have been there have been a disappointment. We went as a family after a long day of sports. Got there about 8:30 and it wasn't crowded. I thought it was closed. We were sat quickly and unfortunately the food came just as quick. We were served cold macaroni and cheese, rice and gravy(rice was hard), cold collars greens and fried chicken that wasn't fresh. My \"candy sweets\" weren't orange they were brown like it was old. We sent several dishes back for new ones but it got to the point where we just said forget it. The waitress fixed the food with no issue but we shouldn't have been served old and cold food to begin with. Maybe the Scottsdale location is better because the Phoenix location food quality has gone down. Unless you have to go before 8:30 to get fresh food. Food should be served fresh until the restaurant closes."}
{"text":"For a long time I dreamed of going to Lo-Lo's.  I'd heard about it from others like some sort of ancient mythology - it sounds amazing and fantastical but you know it can't really be true.  When it comes to Lo-Lo's - believe the hype.

Finding Lo-Lo's: I've driven down Central SO many times and never known how close I really was.  Then one day I saw an arrow spray painted on the side of the building.  \"Lo-Lo's this way!\"  It took a few minutes to realize that that must be THE Lo-Lo's.  I started talking about it w/ friends and we decided we needed to go.  I confirmed the address and the 3 of us set off for flavor adventure.  Yes, you turn at the arrow (Which you only see when driving North on Central) and it's not much at all past that - but don't expect any huge signs, valet service - or even a parking lot.  You'll park right out on the street - and on a busy night that means you may need to walk a bit.

Entering Lo-Lo's:  Stepping through the doors = Waiting area.  Taking 2 steps into Lo-Lo's = Standing in front of someone's table while they are eating.  You can tell this used to be someone's house - and it was a small house at that.  There are just a few \"rooms\" for seating - and the largest has 5 tables.  Our first time there we sat in the room that has just two tables - a 4 and a 2 top - but it's also where the cash register is, where folks pick up to go orders, where they refill the drinks/silverware, where they store extra items that were purchased in bulk and has the doorway to the kitchen and you have to walk through that room to get to the other rooms.  In some places you might think this was the worst table in the house.  At Lo-Lo's I would disagree with you.  We got to listen in on the best conversations and we had the best view of all the amazing food going to the different rooms.  

The Food:  Sweet Tea served in a big Mason Jar.  SOLD!  It was awesome and the refills kept coming.  Soul Food without Sweet Tea is just wrong to me.  As for the rest of the Menu - it's not 30 pages long - in fact I'm pretty sure it's just one piece of paper written on both sides.  And yet it's still SO hard to choose.  The first time we went each of us got something slightly different.  Both my eating companions got some version of a meal that included both Chicken and Waffles.  I bucked the trend and got their Salmon Croquettes with Cheese Eggs, Grits and Waffles.  I could talk for days about how amazing their food is.  Best Eggs I'd ever had.  I am not a big egg person and I was craving these eggs again for a month.  The more I think about them the more I want to go.  The Salmon was amazing - I took one home and it was big enough I made myself a sandwich with it the next day.  The sides are all absolutely amazing.  The Greens have an amazing sweetness aftertaste that I am completely unable to describe.  The Chicken.  Oh, the Chicken.  Let's start w/ this.  I've always thought fried chicken was \"ok\".  I went with 2 folks who love fried chicken - and make their own family handed down recipes.  After their first bites it looked like they had found the holy grail.  It was the best fried chicken I'd ever eaten.  Guess what I've saved for last?  The waffles.  I always eat waffles or pancakes last for 2 reasons 1) They are SO sweet just like a desert and 2) I can only eat a few bites worth.  They are usually too sweet, too sticky, and very quickly mushy.  So, I spread around the butter (removing most of it of course) and drizzled it with some syrup.  It was the lightest, yummiest, buttery heavenly thing I'd ever had.  These were not just waffles.  These were Waffles.  I ate almost the whole thing.  As for Lo-Lo's desert menu - I've heard great things about their Red Velvet cake - but I've never quite been able to get that far into my meal and still order more.  Maybe next time.

Service: We've always had great service.  Servers are usually young and have that \"I'm working at my uncle's restaurant for the summer\" quality - but they are fast, knowledgeable and quick on the refills. 

Atmosphere: If you are from certain parts of the valley - Lo-Lo's may be a bit of a culture shock.  Yes, it is quite possible if you are of the Caucasian persuasion - you may be the only one there during your entire meal.  I've heard some folks say they would be \"afraid\" to go because of that.  My thought?  Get the heck over it.  Should a black person be afraid to go to AZ 88 or Flemings because they might be the only black person there?  Heck no.  And wouldn't you think they were silly for even thinking it?  Exactly.

Overall: Prices are good.  I honestly can't remember how much anything costs.  I blame the food.  But I do remember thinking \"wow, is that all?\" every time we go.  Location is downtown - just minutes from AWA.  Food is out of this freaking world.  Calorie content is... well...  it's not something I like to think about."}
{"text":"There are so many dimensions on which LoLo's deserves 5 stars. Let me count the ways in which I love you, LoLo:

1. Sweet tea, best this side of Mississippi. 'Nuff said. Serving in giant mason jars, now that's just gilding the lilly.
2. Top rate fried chicken.
3. Delicious, golden brown waffles with  a touch of cinnamon and enough butter to qualify you for a free coronary stent if you bring your receipt from breakfast to any local hospital.
4. Real grits. Cheese optional (highly recommended). Also served with an obscene amount of butter.
5. Fried okra, red velvet cake, Kool Aid (also in ginormous mason jars), the list goes on

This place oozes character, charm, incredible food, not to mention half melted butter that seems to find it's way onto anything and everything on your plate (and really what isn't made better with melted butter?).

LoLo's also serves as an excellent litmus test to see if that new guy/gal you've been seeing are going to work out in the long run. Anyone who can plow through a number 1 is A-OK in my book."}
{"text":"Best Catfish in town! 

The hubby & I and our girls 2 & 3 yr old decided to check out LoLos and the food was delish!  If you want some good ol SOUL food, this place is it!  From the moment we walked in to leaving we were treated with good ol southern hospitality.  The hubs order the \"Famous Catfish soulfood platter\" and I was encouraged to try the \" Uncle brotha's Shrimp & Grits,\"  BTW I never knew what grits were so yes, you bet I had to ask.  To sum it up the waitress was right, it was a yummy choice. It was a huge plate, def had to get a doggy bag to take home.  As we were leaving, it was storming and the staff was able to escort us out thru the back and even made a makeshift umbrella and walked my girls and I out as the hubs ran and pulled the truck around!  Great food, great service and exceptional staff!  We Def recommend Lolo's as a great place to chow down :)"}
{"text":"Just came for breakfast and Aaron was the best. I wanted a special omelet and he took great care of me the food was excellent and service even better. I would highly recommend this place. Ask for Aaron you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A bit over-hyped but very tasty! The chicken is fantastic and I love the selection of cool-aid. Waffles are the thin type. Very good. Service isn't great when it's packed though, the waitresses get rude when they are pressured. So go during the off-times!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Roscoe's in LA and always hoped to find something along the same lines here, in my home state. While Lolo's isn't quite Roscoe's, it is still quite delicious. The staff is friendly and very helpful. Thankfully we ordered pick-up, because the line was a half hour wait, just to be seated. It's a popular spot.

The chicken and waffle combo was very tasty, but their fried okra wasn't the best and the lemonade was too sweet.

I am still pleasantly full by this comfort food gem in downtown Phoenix and would recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"If this review was a few years ago it would have been 4 stars. This was my first time back since the remodel. First off remodel looks amazing. Fresh clean new much more spacious....So you ask why did I take away a star? The place is trying too hard. They intentionally spell stuff wrong on the menu in fake slang to give it a hood feeling. Its more expensive than it used be. They've added new combinations of chicken just to make the menu longer. The waffles now are more doughy no flavor. I got the smothered chicken with a gravy that was neither southern tasty or appealing to the eye. The bill for two people with one alcholic drink one appetizer and two dishes was ~50. I'd rather drive further to the closest popeyes and be under 10 bucks a person. Or even Church's and get an amazing apple pie for a buck."}
{"text":"I'm glad I can finally update my rating for LoLo's.  After having a really bad experience, I went a couple of weeks ago and had a good experience.  The waffles were thin and crisp, with a hint of cinnamon, just like I like them.  The fried chicken was well-seasoned and crispy!  The lemonade was sweet and delish!  And the service was good.  I can resume recommending LoLo's to people.  :)"}
{"text":"How cool that you can get Chicken and Waffles or Southern Grits in Phoenix! It's high quality food and great service!
 My kids love it too!"}
{"text":"Delicious classic chicken and waffles, good biscuits and gravy, supremely nice wait staff.  The chicken basically falls right off the bone.  My Belgian girlfriend approved of the waffles, so they win all the way around.

I would not advise coming here on a diet."}
{"text":"First, Lo-Lo's only gets 4 stars becuase L.A. is home to the famous Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles, which is the BEST chicken and waffles. I ate like every week for a good 3 years. Oh and I met Jesse Jackson there lol. 

Back to Lo-Lo's- the food was excellent. If you've never tried soul food, you're missing out, and should definitely treat yourself to the early heart attack because it's worth it. Just about nothing beats the juicy fried chicken breast smothered in gravy with a waffle on the side dripping in sweet syrup. Seriously, it's heaven for your mouth. 

Highlights: 
Sweet tea - Sweet as in it tastes like there's 5,000 packs of sugar in there and will send you into a diabetic coma. Hell yeah!

Greens- I love greens. These greens taste like they're made with bacon. Again, hell yeah! 

Potatoes and gravy- The gravy could be a little thicker but I still love it.

The only thing I didn't like too much was the mac and cheese. 

The service was fantastic, everyone was kind, prompt, and attentive. You can be waiting quite a while for a table, especially on Sunday mornings when people are coming back from church. Get there right when they open and don't worry about suffering from heat stroke in the summer. Or just wait in your car with the AC blasting until your name gets called."}
{"text":"I loved the fried catfish - not greasy but flaky and tasty!  I'd never had grits before so I have no idea how good they are to the GP, only that I THOUGHT THEY WERE DELICIOUS!  What a nice surprise!  The greens were tasty with a slow burn that sneaks up.  The mac and cheese was VERY cheesy.  Good flavor yet I just couldn't eat much.  Really rich!  Now to the chicken.  It was OK.  I think I expected a different flavor or preparation so I was a little disapointed, but I ate it because it was good anyway...just not - YUM, like the catfish (personal preference)  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Listen. ....Keenen is the shiiiittttt!!! We had a 6 top and he was a little busy but totally had time to take care of us! It was my friends bday and we just had a blast. He was teasing me about ordering a salad and helped my friends order properly etc... I had a chef salad and my other friends all had chicken and waffles. All were delicious! We had a lot of cocktails and a lot of fun. Thank you Keenen and Lolos!"}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed. People always rush to try chicken and waffle spots when they see one especially people from the south. When I first moved to PHX from Houston (Texas), came in here and thought I would get some southern style chicken.....nah not at all, food was not seasoned well- very bland- even had friends in town, they said the same. Friends even mentioned, no need to rush back when they get back in town. I got three wings and a waffle and that's about......it......"}
{"text":"Being born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee, it has made it extremely hard to be lenient when it comes to soul food and my southern favorites. I'm from a city that is known for their music, hospitality and food (especially the hot chicken). In other words, I know good chicken like a choir director knows his keys. 

After my experience at Lo-Lo's (twice now), I can definitely say this is as close to good soul food one is going to find here in The Valley. (that I have tried at least).

The chicken and waffles were pretty good, chicken could have had more seasoning and been crunchier but it was still edible and decent, waffle was alright but it could of been much fluffier. My side items were also lacking a little seasoning but like I said, this is Phoenix, AZ so we gotta accept what we have when it comes to soul food.

Lo-Lo's is not the best in the food department but the service is OUTSTANDING. My server my last visit was extremely friendly, all smiles, and provided GREAT conversation. Bartender was also very pleasant and the food runner was a delight as well. I didn't have to ask or want for anything. My only complaint is it took them FOREVER to finally send our server over to take our orders and the restaurant wasn't packed. 

However, I still have yet to find somewhere here in the valley that fills the void of my southern heart. I will probably be yearning for good chicken until I go back to Nashville one day, but until then, these lackluster places will have to do.

Lo-Lo's has a wonderful vibe though and great interior, they even have a DJ playing all the old school jams making you and your party feel like you're vibing at a bingo night. 

In my opinion, Lo-Lo's is leaps and bounds better than tacky, overrated, poor-service Roscoe's Chicken N Waffles of Los Angeles."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious. Some of the best fried chicken and waffles I have ever had.

Go for the Lo-Lo's plate (with white meat) and a jar of sweet tea."}
{"text":"My boyfriend got chicken, french fries, and macaroni and cheese to-go.  First, he had to place his order at a small area in the back, then they told him to wait up front; he trusted that they would bring the food up to him.

20 minutes later he goes back to check on our order, and it is just sitting there for who knows how long; every second counts when it comes to food.  Then a girl notices him and quickly hands the food to him; it is clear that she realized she forgot to give him the food.

The chicken was dry and had no flavour; that hot sauce was a must.  The fries were undercooked and soggy.  The macaroni and cheese was the worst that I've ever had.  I would have rather eaten Popeye's for dinner.

I don't understand the hype with this place.  The concept is great, but they fail to deliver in quality."}
{"text":"This place is great. I'm always looking for restaurants owned and operated by locals. I'm anti-chain and I know these are local people that MAY own the franchises but it's all \"formula\" food and nothing special.

Lolo's is a delightful alternative to bucket chicken and \"grand slam\" waffles. And THEY'VE GOT OKRA AND GRITS!  I'm white folks but I was born in New Orleans and miss the food items they have. Their red-gravy is tops and hardy the only place to find decent fries with gravy.

Try everything, it's ALL good. I haven't made the Scottsdale location but it sounds like a great work-lunch place I'll have to try out. 

Gogo Lolo's! It's a can't miss in Phoenix local food."}
{"text":"The place was packed with a half hour wait when I was getting my bags at the airport.  Yelp allows you to put your name in online.  Showed up to the restaurant with a massive line and gave them my name and they say us down immediately.  Best Chicken and waffles...PERIOD."}
{"text":"Best biscuits and gravy by far...they add bell pepper and onion. . . yes!  Kool aid made perfectly sweet and I had a mixed drink, Lolos punch, with kool aid omg!!! the chicken breast was crispy, not very meaty though, but tasty.   Waffle was ok, too much cinnamon for my taste. Partner enjoyed his fried catfish and fried chicken and said it was great. grits were great too. Will go back. Roscoes is better IMO"}
{"text":"The absolute best fried chicken I've ever had. The waffles and syrup are heaven on a plate, with a hint of cinnamon.

Lo-Lo's is a required stop after an overnight visit to Phoenix. My fiance and I wake up, check out of our hotel in a hurry, ignoring any and all continental breakfasts that stand in our way. We never remember where Lo-Lo's is exactly, except that it's on some side street, but fortunately GPS has never let us down.

Lo-Lo's makes a point of hanging signs that indicate that service is slow, but I've never had a bad experience there.

Mmm mmm mmm!"}
{"text":"Amazing dinner amazing service. Joseph was a great server the banana pudding was a great dessert to finish off our celebration."}
{"text":"Good Southern Fried Chicken and Mac&Cheese. Wasn't a fan of the cornbread and the waffle was thinner than I expected.  The sausage gravy was okay but I would rather have the chicken gravy my mom used to make.   Overall it was good and I would go back but I wouldn't wait in line an hour like some people do."}
{"text":"Don't come here looking for high-brow concept food or life-changing meals, but gosh, for what it is - it is great.

Waffles - BOOM. So good. With copious amounts of syrup - even better! 

Chicken - Not too shabby!! Enjoyed it.

We had a friendly server who was super laid back and low key, but also checked in on us and got us what we need. Not pretentious, not too uppity or corny with their message/branding. They just have a good niche for fairly priced breakfast food (namely the chicken and waffles!) 

I don't know that we'd go out of our way to come back here, but if someone suggested it, we'd be there!"}
{"text":"Listen, I want to support this business but I cannot in good conscience give Lo-Lo's a good review due to the perpetually awful service received on 5+ visits to this location.

It truly does not seem to matter when you come...the wait for a table has never EVER been less than 40 minutes on any occasion that I've come here. Often, it's been an hour or more. This has been consistent during brunch, lunch, and dinner...on weekends and weekdays.

The only reason I continually subject myself to this is because when my family visits from Ohio, this is the only place they want to eat! And they want it almost every damn day! Argghhh!

Perhaps that is because of the storied fried chicken. As a pescatarian, I wouldn't know. The only meat I eat is fish. My family raves about this chicken though and claim it's worth the wait and poor service we receive in order for them to get it.

I'm skeptical to say the least.

Speaking of fish- I am less than impressed with the fried fish at Lo-Lo's. I've tried it twice and it's virtually flavorless. What I believe is happening is, they season the fish AFTER they fry it instead of before? I don't know, just a theory. I can't otherwise explain why it's so bland.

The fries however? Delicious!! I absolutely love them. I'm also a big fan of their omelettes. The waffles, while yummy, are always soggy and this ruins them for me. I like a nice crisp waffle. Not a flaccid, limp one. But every time I come here, that's what I'm served. Even when I specifically ask for it to be crispy/not soft. Very frustrating.

I also have to comment on the wait staff. Many of my servers have been perfectly nice people but ALL of them have screwed up my or my party's order on EVERY VISIT. They either forget certain things you've specified about your order, bring the wrong sides, or forget multiple times to bring napkins, drink re-fills, etc.. 

I really question whether Lo-Lo's hires people who are experienced at waiting tables or simply welcomes any old Joe off the street a job serving their customers. To be a good server, one has to have to have a good memory, be fast, and take proper orders. In theory, it seems simple, but in practice it's really not. 

I truly hope Lo-Lo's will improve and warrant an updated review from me in the very near future, but I won't hold my breath."}
{"text":"Beat C&W ever!! 

It took 2hrs from check in to the check for two. Server was very slow and seemed to be flustered or overwhelmed. 

We would go again just maybe a different time."}
{"text":"We stopped by during a weekend visit to Scottadale.  I ordered a 2 piece with fries and my fiancé got the lo-lo special (chicken, 2 waffles). I really liked the chicken but it was pretty greasy. I looooved the waffles!!! It was soo good, I wish I would have just ordered that. It almost had a cinnamon taste to it. 

Service is extremely quick and friendly. They take the order fast and the food comes to the table 5 min later. 

What I did find annoying is that they ran out of diet Pepsi!!! I mean what restaurant runs out of it?!?? Oh well."}
{"text":"I don't appreciate having to wait an HOUR for my food this morning while other people come in after me and get their food well in advance.  The hostess was rude, I asked multiple times where my order was and got nowhere with the manager.  Stay away, plenty of other options out there with better service."}
{"text":"Had higher expectations, the food is overpriced and the wait time is too long. I had been to other restaurant with the same concept and it the taste was better and prices were fair. Overall not a fan of this restaurant but they had stand up comedy, which semi blocked the bathroom entrance, that was very entertaining."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the service is terrible. 

We were having family lunch so our party was big. The hostess told us to go wait outside while we wait to be seated. My sister in law asked if there were misters and she said yes. When we get outside the misters are off and it's triple degrees outside. We asked for the manager and let him know that we were rudely told to wait outside. He not once apologized and instead justified his rude employee."}
{"text":"Service great on Friday night.  Mac n Cheese tasty side.  Yams are to die for.  Tenders are great with hot sauce. I'm not big on their smothered potatoes. Shrimp n Grits were juicy and succulent. Best biscuit ever.  Monique was the best server- attentive, sweet,  helpful,  and just plain welcoming."}
{"text":"Out of biscuits.  Yes.  Just out.  Not busy on my visit, and yet my simple food order takes a very long time (remember, this is an airport location with a limited menu and no seating).  Then, they got the order wrong and of course it's too late to go back and get it corrected."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Sat for literally 20minutes before even speaking to a server. Place looked not even half full too. Got my drink 25minutes into being here. Tables are extremely dirty too. Never coming back and will tell family and friends not to either."}
{"text":"I have been to the downtown location and yep, the food is the same.  Service is a little disjointed here like who's on first?  Still go, eat...you iwll like it."}
{"text":"Awesome Chicken and waffles, finally i get it.  This is what everyone raves about. The KK is more food than any one person needs but i couldn't stop eating. Fun atmosphere. Great for watching football with a full bar. Top notch servers."}
{"text":"Met with friends from work today and it was my first visit to this restaurant. Parking is nearly impossible and their entire parking lot is valet...so you'll need to park on the surrounding streets, or pay. The restaurant was really busy when we were there and the food took a little while, but not a big deal. I had the omelette and it was huge!! It was really good and I took most of our home and easily have another couple meals with it. When it came time to go, we asked for a refill and was told that they weren't free. Seriously?! I can't remember being in a place that didn't offer free refills. Overall the staff was alright, but I actually like the atmosphere at Mrs. White's is a lot better and everybody is really friendly."}
{"text":"This was a real treat on my vacation in Phoenix.  Robert our waiter was great too!  We even went back the Sunday morning of our departure for another meal which I cleverly placed Shrimp and Grits breakfast in sandwich bags inside wide mouth water bottles and brought it home in my suitcase to Cleveland, Ohio and had them for dinner. Every thing we had at our table was great!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Food is great, service is fast. Im glad they just opened one in Gilbert. We've already been there. If your looking for something delicious and new try chicken and waffles you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is OK.  Solid, traditional American fare ~ lots of grease, lots of calories, lots of carbs!  

Gotta be doing something right given their wait time is soooooooo long?!  

If in the mood for good food and not in a hurry"}
{"text":"Come on! What more do you need? This place is great and we Phoenicians are so lucky to have LoLos."}
{"text":"This short-sighted establishment will not allow you to place an order in advance unless you are using a credit card.  They punish cash paying customers by making them come to the restaurant to place an order and wait for the food.  Such a primitive marketing mindset deserves no more than 1 star."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Very good \"hood food\" y'all rock I got the Betty boop \"DD\" the waffle was bomb and the chicken was juicy!!!!"}
{"text":"Who would have ever thought, chicken and waffles combination?  It is crazy, but it sure does.  The location of hidden inside a big plaza of Albertsons, Aces Hardware, Gas Station, and much more.  It is really hard to find unless you have been inside the shopping center.  People here in AZ like to say something is located on the northwest corner of the street.  This would make it impossible to describe.

Once you get there, the restaurant is pretty small.  Typically there is a pretty long wait, but I was lucky the day I went. One good thing is they offer white breast chicken meat, which is always a bonus.  The chicken was tasty, even though I am normally not a fan of fried chicken.   I love waffles, but it seemed like the waffles came out cold, as though they were reheated or Eggo Waffles.  I loved Eggo Waffles growing up, but I don't expect frozen waffles at an establishment.  I would stick to the chicken and call this place Lo Lo Chicken House."}
{"text":"And here from la to see what the hype was all about. 
First thing when I came in for a party of two the lady said ok I'll put your name on the list and as I'm still standing there, another hostess walks up and ask the guy behind me how many in his party and seated him right away. I asked why did the guy with a party of 3 get a seat and she replies that his name was on the list...this was false because the other hostess had no paper to look at and he asked how many not calling out his name to check in...I questioned it and moved on being that it wasn't packed out 

My waitress however turned my experience around for me... she was very pleasant and knowledgeable about what she liked and didn't like. 

I ordered the famous soul-food platter. 3 piece of chicken smothered in gravy and onions with mac, yams and cornbread.  The food is ok...definitely hyped a little much but it's not bad. The huge jar of koolaid was great (might be too sweet for some) the cobbler is ok as well...

Whenever I'm in AZ I'll try to visit and try out different things 
Also my cousin let me taste her waffle and it's pretty good, similar to roscoes waffles"}
{"text":"Love this place! My boyfriend and I frequent LoLos regularly and I have yet to be disappointed.  Chicken is always cooked to perfection and the waffles are always fluffy and delicious.  The mac and cheese is also a must for every visit.  They have a good selection of drinks, and even tho personally I wasn't a big fan of the cool-aid cocktails the concept was fun and worth trying."}
{"text":"Lolos is probably the best soul food in Arizonia. They never disappoint and I've been more than a few times. And they have \"adult koolaid\" and the best orange dreamsicle drink"}
{"text":"Today's lunch adventure: Lo-Lo's chicken and waffles at the Phoenix location. I had to let my food settle before I began writing. I am still in a food coma. I can compare this food coma to being Ryan Lochte for maybe 30 mins, because I feel slow and DUMB- Jeah!  When driving to this place, you better look for it or you will miss it, but it is kind of hard to miss with people surrounding the door waiting to get in. 

We found a parking spot, walked in, gave our name and waited a total of 10 mins. We actually stood outside of the door for a minute or two before we went inside to see if your name was called.  I have been wanting to come to this restaurant for along time now so I am glad I went with my friend Tamirra. She told me to pace myself because if not I will get sick.  I seriously thought by the end of this lunch date I would be sweating grease and my pores would ooze of grease. I order the #9 lil amadi. I order it with 2 thighs and one waffle. It came out in 10 mins and all I can say is Oh my WORD! It was amazeballs.  The chicken skin was crispy and juicy and the waffle could have been in the waffle iron for a tad longer but it wasn't mushy by any means. For the drink, I just ordered a water. There were two girls sitting next to me asking what the kool aid menu was, have you ever imagined asking a server what the koolaid menu was for the day? The server gave the colors and the respective flavors. She named them off: red, blue and purple and then went into the actual flavors tropical punch, blue raspberry and grape.  Classy! :) 

Overall the meal was really good, the service was good as well. The server came probably a handful of times, to give us our drinks, take our order, give us boxes and the check.

The only complaint that I have, which isn't even my problem but apparently they do not allow outside drinks inside of the restaurant. There was a gentleman drinking a starbucks coffee and a server actually stood there and waited for him to take a \"last sip\" before he had to hand it over.  It wasn't as though he wasn't going to order a purple drank!"}
{"text":"OH.MY.GOODNESS! I don't know that there is anything on the menu that is bad! My boyfriend and I wanted to go out to eat on a Saturday night. We were starved but couldn't decide. I usually pick the region of food and he picks the restaurant (bc he's from here and I'm not). I said hearty American food or American bistro. We decide as we're walking to the car....CHICKEN AND WAFFLES. So random. 

We get to Lolo's and I'm loving the atmosphere. The art on the walls is cool. The music is good. Everyone looks happy to be stuffing their faces. I see mason jars with colorful drinks all over which really sparked my interest. BUT decided against booze and went with a traditional sweet tea. Holy cow was this sweet tea everything I hoped it would be. It reminded me of sweet tea in the south. Like Georgia south. The REAL south. Not too sugary but not super bitter. It was just right and so refreshing. 

We got an app sampler platter. Fried okra, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, and slaw. The fried okra was crispy and seasoned to perfection. The potatoes were creamy. The mac n cheese was probably my favorite. You know when the cheese is sharp enough that it doesn't need seasoning and does that warm gooey thing when you pull it apart. Ya ...it was like that! The slaw wasn't soggy like most slaw is at bbq joints. It was still crispy and very flavorful. 

Then dinner came! We both opted for chicken and waffles. The chicken was so moist and the batter was fried for the perfect amount of time. Its like they have it down to a science in the kitchen here. The outside is crispy and seasoned well and the inside is moist and hot. The waffle was delicious. It almost had a sweet flavor too it. It wasn't chewy it wasn't soggy. It was as if the food was plated, put in the window, and whisked away to our tables immediately. Each bite I took I made sure to have an equal chicken to waffle ratio and dabbed it in syrup then in a little hot sauce. My mouth is watering just reminiscing about this meal lol. The prices are on point. The serving sizes are HUGE...so in reality you get more than what you're paying for.

We will be back again....and again.....and again...and again! Besides, I still gotta try the mason jar kook-aid!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the costumer service could use improvement. I have visited this location about 3 times and 2 of those times the waitress seemed like she didn't want to be there, we where given attitude and no one would refill our drinks. poor service Id recommend going to a different location."}
{"text":"Went to the Scottsdale location with my running buddies on Saturday morning.  Parking is awful, limited and mostly valet.  Food is not bad, didn't like the fact that are no substitutions.  Catchy names and the iced tea comes in a Ball glass jar."}
{"text":"Okay! Lo-Lo's is aight! Truthfully the food is not bad, probably the better soul food restaurant in town! Get there early enough so your favorite dish is available. They tend to run out! And though improved, the service is a little slow after placing your order. But they have a warning sign about the slowness to help ease the tension as you wait! 

I am little partial to this because I think my soul food dishes can give Lo-Lo's a run for their money! LOL! But I am a little touched! 

What surprises me most is all the Caucasian Yelper's that have eating at this soul food spot! Ya'll love ya'll some chicken too uh?? :)  I might have to throw a soul food dinner and invite some of my fellow yelpers to come compare! I can be a fierce DIVA in the kitchen!  Watch out now!"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday. Food was good. Had tenders, mac n cheese and collard greens. All worthy of my southern tastebuds. Endless Mimosas for $12! Service was ok. Another unnecessary valet."}
{"text":"Lolo's is my dirtiest secret. Well, it's one of 'em anyway. I don't care where I live in AZ, all roads lead to this joint. I'll admit, on my first trip, I was scared. Scared I wouldn't find the joint. Scared I'd park illegally in the non-lot. Scared I wouldn't get a seat. And finally, scared of what fried chicken with gravy and onions would actually taste like.

None of my fears were warranted. There's ample street parking at Lolo's. If you have to hoof it a little to get there, you'll appreciate the walk back to the car. And you'll need it to burn off a fraction of what you've just put down. At peak times, things get a little hectic inside. There's not much of a waiting space but the Lolo's staff is friendly and helpful, they'll get your butt in a seat as quickly as they can. They'll also guide you toward places to stand where you won't be a hazard to the heavy trafficking of chicken, collared greens, mac and cheese and, of course, waffles going on. 

Once you're seated, eat it all. 

Seriously though, there's a Lolo's platter for everyone and plenty of sides. Service is friendly and efficient without be hurried or quick. That said, this place is all about the food. It's my favorite place to take out-of-town guests. In short, Lolo's is the type of place that Phoenix can be proud of."}
{"text":"This place is a must stop when in Phoenix. 
The food is excellent and prepared just the way I like it"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to go for really amazing food! We usually get the soul food platter so we can try different items on the menu. I highly recommend the catfish, mac n cheese, and the cornbread. Prices are reasonable, and it's a really comfortable environment. I HIGHLY recommend it."}
{"text":"I would eat here daily if I could afford it and the heart attack that would soon follow. 
The food is absolutely worth going and waiting for.
I'm giving this 5* in spite of the long wait because our service was perfect. Friendly, not pushy, helpful with the menu, and made this a great place to take our young kids. 
We will be back many times."}
{"text":"Ok so I have worked at what I believe to be the best chicken and waffle place ever (dame's chicken and waffles in NC), so I of course will compare all places to Dames.

First I want to say we went on a weekday around 10 am, no wait at all, we were greeted and sat immediately and not by the hostess (she was seating someone else), the waiter stepped up and sat us. Our server Danielle was awesome, attentive and friendly, we talked about SB weekend and the madness! we will always request her. 

As for the food, it was all good. But that's it. The chicken is bland, it looks like they season the flour and not the chicken, big mistake. The waffles also good nothing to write home about, they were thin but good. We also added grits and eggs also good. 

We will return, my kids loved it, they say it gets 5 stars clearly I disagree. I would give 3.5 if I could. 

See you next time."}
{"text":"I only gave it 3 stars because I liked the set up. The food was boring. Nothing great about it and for the prices not worth it. The music was WAY too loud. The server was slow and didn't really listen. He acted like he had our orders memorized but he forgot things. It took way too long to get orders in and get the food. One time experience and that's all I need. I won't be returning. I can make that food at home for half the price."}
{"text":"A great big thank you to our waiter, Keenan; who made the morning super enjoyable with his wit, charm and efficiency. This Lolo's is a bit classier than the original, though the food is still just as down-home delish! I do prefer the original restaurant's vibe, but this locale worked well for our trio today. The chicken was tender, crunchy, and savory and the waffles were golden brown sweet heaven. The grits were fluffy and oh so buttery, while the candied sweets stole the show. Staff and service are friendly, young, and efficient. Great meal, thank you LoLo's. Don't worry... we'll be back. :)"}
{"text":"I've reviewed you before and every time I visit I am more in love with you. Yesterday's meal couldn't have been any better. How is the food so fresh, hot, and delicious time after time after time? Service is amazing as always and the fried chicken was on point. Our sides - candied sweets (wow!) homey grits, spicy green beans and red beans over rice were all terrific too. If only fried chicken were fat free..... Love you Lolo's!!"}
{"text":"I don't like writing these kids d of reviews but they are necessary. As a woman from the south, I have been so disappointed with the lack of southern and soul food options here. When I saw LoLos I was so excited and couldn't wait to get a piece of home and a good meal. It didn't work out that way. The service was mediocre at best, host was rude and didn't take our names down for a table while we waited. The food was ridiculously priced for what is was....$5 for a tiny side of collards, are you out your mind???? A bushel big enough to feed a full grown family just dinner on collards is $5, get real. To my surprise, they also didn't have apple cider vinegar, or even white vinegar to go with it, I had to ask several times if the cook would possibly share some of his. My server was young, so I'll give him some credit for being inexperienced but he was terrible at serving (maybe he was new?), that being said, he was very kind and I appreciate that. The food didn't come out together, wasn't what we ordered and took forever just to get it. Do you literally go out back and grab a chicken and go from there? If so, it's at least from scratch. The food was mediocre as well. I was really wanting it to be great food even if not a great atmosphere/service... but the food was by no means soul food or remotely a southern cooked meal. I was disappointed and won't be going back, which is a shame because I live downtown AND I love to eat out. If anyone has a recommendation where to try, please let me know!"}
{"text":"Ok.. So I had to call one of my African American friends and ask him \"What the HELL is so goddam special about Lo-Los?!!\" To which he Literally laughed out loud and said \"NOTHING!!\"

I knew he would have been and have some type of input. He had, and he did. No! I am not racist or stereotyping anyone! I know he loves Fried chicken and would give me an honest opinion.  He and I both unanimously decided that this place SUCKS. He told me \"you should have called me from the parking lot, I would have saved you a bunch of time and aggravation.\" 

This is definitely one of those cases in which you should NEVER believe the hype.  

Over priced. $3 for KOOL AID! (Anybody that orders Kool aid for $3... I have some real estate I want to discuss with you) $16 for dry flavorless chicken and cinnamon waffles. Gimme a break. I can get an entire family meal of chicken at KFC for less than that! And the KFC actually is juicy and has flavor!

The fried chicken is flavorless. Seriously. Its like flour and a dash of salt. Thats it. NO seasonings at all. They talk about passing down recipes for generations and generation...? WHaaaaaa?  I wonder if while the recipe was being passed down, they deleted the spices to save money on the overpriced food they are selling to us bamboozled people out there... It honestly tastes like fried chicken from a Lubys cafeteria thats specifically cooked to cater to the older folks on restricted diets. 

The waffles were yummy. I will give em that. Cornbread was dry. 

It took over 30 minutes to get a burger. The rest of the meal came out in parts. They forgot some of it altogether till we asked for it. 

This place sucks. Seriously. Its much to do about NOTHING. 

I recommend a name change. Lo-Lo's Hi-Hi. Low low quality and high high prices."}
{"text":"WHERE DO I BEGIN
for starters lets just say this place is B.O.M.B
the red kool aid ROCKS!!!
the chicken is oh so amazing but the best is the waffles and the honey bbq wings/ chinas chicken . I fell in love all over again
sadly to say but the best relationships i have had are with my food but oh so totally worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Best airport chicken I've ever had. And the price was fair too. Love the customer service here by cashier Jennifer and Mark the cook. They were very accommodating."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try Lo-Lo's and after about a 25 minute wait we decided to sit at the bar which was a mistake.  We ended up sitting next to a bunch of trash which sat there for about 15-20 minutes.  It took about 15 minutes for the bartender to acknowledge that we were there and didn't even hand us menus. We finally just asked for Bloody Marys and he started making them then stopped half way through to clean up around the bar and start doin other things around the bar.  The woman sitting next to us asked for hot sauce and ended up having to ask us to hand her the hot sauce next to us since she was ignored by the staff. I definitely won't be back with such poor service and would rather go to Denny's in the area or one of the better places in the area."}
{"text":"Food is usually good, but quality (especially of any meat) is inconsistent. Service NEEDS IMPROVEMENT, and that applies to ALL locations. 

I started going here when this location was literally a hole in the wall. It was cramped, the line was long, and the food was AMAZING! 

Now they've expanded to at least 4 locations (Central Phx, PHX airport, Scottsdale, Gilbert) and the QUALITY of food, service and experience is so disappointing that we rarely visit.

We happened to be in Central Phx last night, and we decided to stop for dinner with our 3yo and 10mo so I could get my chicken & waffles fix. 

We ordered drinks, which were correct, then ordered food, and everything seemed fine and good. My meal (the Lolo's) was brought out correct and timely. And then it just snowballed. 

My husband ordered the Hood burger, and was given a chicken sandwich by a server who was not assigned to our table. Another server, also not assigned to our table, brought a plain cheeseburger to our table, taking the chicken sandwich away. STILL the wrong burger. Our assigned server FINALLY came over, and she took the burger back to the kitchen, they plopped what we're assuming were the other ingredients onto it, and gave it back to him. It's a $14 burger, and to say it was disappointing is an understatement. Also, he asked our server for extra mayo, and every time she returned she forgot it. (She never wrote anything down either, and her memory was evidently more sieve than steel-trap ). We asked SEVERAL times for our sons mac n cheese before we finally received it. Our server acted exasperated when she said 'they didn't bring you anything, did they?' As though it was someone else's responsibility to do her job. 

We asked for boxes to go after just a few bites of food, which our server did manage to get for us. She placed our bill on the table, never asking if we wanted anything else. I asked about the banana pudding I had ordered to-go when I had ordered my meal. She acted like she was about to get it and walked to the kitchen, but then casually walked by moments later to take our bill off our table only to return with the corrected one (including the banana pudding). I had noticed she hadn't written it on our original order  so I suppose no surprise she had forgotten it. 

She got a 10% tip. My husband wasn't pleased with his meal. I was moderately satisfied with mine. But the meal was over $50, and as they had messed up his sandwich, he shouldn't have even been charged for it. 

We made several bathroom runs with the baby and toddler. The bathroom stalls were low on toilet paper and the bathroom smelled like sewage. It was evident no one thought it was their job to keep the bathroom tidy or stocked. While I was in the women's washroom, a lady actually had to open her stall door while sitting on the toilet to ask me to get her toilet paper! Poor lady! Glad I could help her, but that's just how low stocked the bathroom was. 

Overall, disappointing and I no longer can recommend this place in good conscience. I've been here in the morning, early afternoon and now in the evening... and the only thing that is consistent is the inconsistency they maintain with the food, service and experience. I have loved this place for a long time, but I doubt I'll be visiting any longer  and I certainly won't be advising any out of town friends to try it anymore."}
{"text":"Been here on a weekend morning and a weekday evening. I was lucky both times and missed the rush. No wait time and I was seated immediately. Both times we had friendly servers and the service was pretty fast. While we received our food fairly quickly, the follow up was poor. I noticed that both times the servers would disappear for extended periods of time so it took awhile for us to get refills on our drinks, to go boxes, our check, etc. But I guess it worked out because it gave us time to catch up with friends. 

I had the chicken and waffles both times and it was very tasty. I would definitely go back. They always play great music too. Takes me back to my younger days"}
{"text":"You know you are in the \"South\" when you are drinking ice tea from a jar! Well, technically I was, South Phoenix to be exact.  In fact, the tea was unsweetened! Yes, I know, a Southern faux pas! Might of been the healthiest thing one could order here.

So after waiting a few long minutes, my main feast arrived.  Where do I start? Ah, good old chicken leg, nice, small and manageable.  Done! Time for my double layer waffles topped with creamy, melty butter.  \"That's money!\" borrowing a gleeful phrase Guy Fieri always says in his Food Network show, D, D, and D. :)

So my two other pieces were the breast and thigh.  I knew what I was getting into so I carefully avoided the glistening, crunchy evil they call: the skin.  But I did have a little and it was packed with all the great tasting herbs and spices that make up this Southern style cuisine.  That is what makes it distinct from your mainstream chains.

Now, the battle between the chicken and waffle, I give the waffle a slight edge.  Its not the thick kind you might expect, but its still pretty good.  Well, all in all, I'm glad somebody in the deep South came up with this comforting duo that even my inner soul can taste."}
{"text":"Can't tell you about the food. We didn't stay long enough to order any. From the pretentiousness of the valet parking (probably due to having to compete with people staying at the hotel next door who don't care where they park) to the ridiculously, overpoweringly loud DJ, to the way-too-hip-hop for it's own good menu, we decided to get out of there while the gettin' was good and before my headache from the pounding \"music\" gave me a stroke. We may try the Phoenix location at some point, but the Scottsdale location is permanently scratched off the list of places to go."}
{"text":"Have I really never reviewed Lo-Lo's? Seriously?? 

This morning, Dottsy, Robert M and I headed for SoDo (is that what the hipsters are calling the area just south of downtown?) for some chicken and waffle perfection. Lo-Lo's hits the mark on everything: my gravy and onion covered chicken was all sorts of awesomeness, the waffles were golden brown loveliness, the greens were bang on, the mac and cheese a creamy blissful experience, the red beans and rice were smartly appealing and the fried okra was splendid happiness. Sure, we ordered a lot of sides, but we wanted to be fair. 

Lo-Lo's was like a religious experience--Sunday service was being played on the radio, there were babies crying, their food is also served in Heaven (or at least that's keeping me focused on the afterlife). 

As well as being perfectly filled with some of the best food ever, we also had a marketing brainstorming session. The first was a tour of some great soul food restaurants using Metro and make it into a UYE. Its name? Pause for dramatic effect: The Soul Train. Something else came up but we're keeping a tight lid on that project."}
{"text":"I got me some chicken and waffles and mmmmm it was so good! If you come here this is obviously a must have. Period."}
{"text":"Waffles were pretty good, but I thought the chicken was great. Cooked tender with a lightly crispy and flavorful breading. They were packed on the Saturday afternoon I went so it took some time to get seated, but the service was friendly and expedient for the rest of our meal. I will be heading back soon."}
{"text":"This is the best place in Phoenix Arizona to eat breakfast black on black ran what more can I say the check for I'm here to eat the salmon croquettes myself so I'm in heaven"}
{"text":"Closed at 10:45 on Friday, not midnight as listed on Yelp. This was extremely inconvenient as I left a party venue early to make it there on time!"}
{"text":"I was recommended here to have my first chicken & waffles and I was not disappointed! Some of the best fried chicken I've ever had! I was surprised how good the combination of the savory and sweet was. It has such a cozy, comfy vibe. Definitely recommend coming here if you've never had chicken & waffles before!!!"}
{"text":"Wanted lolos this morning, went to their old location to discover it's closed. Spent time to find their new location. It's in a hotel parking lot. We parked our car and the 'valet attendant' (yes lolos in a budget hotel parking lot has valet) informed us that unless they valet our car, we MAY get towed. The hotel owns parking and can tow any cars not parked by lolos valet at will. 

After all of the effort to get lolos, we left due to parking. I do not want some kid driving my new car. 

I am sad I didn't get to enjoy this beautiful new location over something this dumb. Are lolos lawyers so terrible they didn't notice the hotel parking caveat when they closed the deal? Even the valet guy agreed it was dumb. Hopefully they get these kinks worked out."}
{"text":"I wish I would have taken a picture of the food.  Anyway, we went yesterday on a Saturday around 2:30pm.  We were a party of 6 and it took an hour to be seated, after they said it would take 30-40 minutes.  The waiter was good (Deion), but it took too long for the food to arrive.  However, overall, the food was OK - I had the fried Catfish which was good but the side of rice with gravy had no taste and my other side was fries and I think  they gave me about 10 fries, that were, just OK.  Lemonade was ok.  I sampled other plates at our table and the fried chicken was very good, actually better than the fried catfish.  The fried gizzards, tasteless but macaroni and cheese was very good.  Since this was my first time, I know now what to order and what not to order next time I come.

Fried Chicken - Very good
Macaroni and Cheese- Very good
Fried Catfish  - Good
Fried Green beans - Ok
French Fries - Ok
Rice and gravy - Not good, tasteless
Fried gizzard - Not good, tasteless
Cornbread - if you like cornbread that taste like cake then you will like it but it was too sweet for me"}
{"text":"Come early... or be prepared to wait... Which I had ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM WITH! It was early spring in Phoenix, so waiting outside wasn't a big deal at all. One thing that would have made this experience extra ordinary is if they had a bartender or a server working the people waiting outside. We could have got a jar of DRANK before we actually walked in and sat down and our appetites would have REALLY been right. 
I ordered the fried chicken, fries, and mac and cheese. I must say I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of food. You can tell they serve hundreds of people on a daily basis and their level of consistency of their food was exceptional. 
Moreover, our server, I believe his name was Aaron (I apologize if I am incorrect) service was the cream of the crop. He took care of our table, he was fun, he was exciting, he joked with us, all things that make the experience that much better. 
I will be back in Phoenix within the next month, you better believe that I will be here as soon as I land! Its not that far from the airport, I am sure I will be able to smell the aroma of the fried chicken as soon as I land. 
Damn son, you all need to get a location in Denver, PHO REAL!"}
{"text":"One thing I can say about Lo-Lo's... the experience is consistent. Last time I was in PHX I went to the Lo-Lo's by the airport, it was a Sunday, it was brunch time, and it was PACKED. This particular time when I went to the one in Scottsdale, it wasn't packed at all (Saturday afternoon) and we were seated immediately. 

As much as I would like to order something different than Chicken and Waffles, my mind just wouldn't let me. It was pulling on my heart strings, and I did it again! No shame in my order, however; I am sure the waitress was like DAY-UM... you smashed three pieces of chicken and waffles?? The only thing I see left on your plate is a chicken bone graveyard! 

I am sure it goes without saying the food was excellent, just like it is every time I have been... A PHX staple, in Lo-Lo's, a place that I feel like I HAVE to come back to every time I go to PHX... Excellent food, excellent service, solid value, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, but mediocre waffles. The chicken had no seasoning. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Cozy place, great amounts of food for little money, they serve koolaide!!!!  Its all great I loved it both times so far, once in 2003 when I went to review it for the school newspaper, and again 8 years later when I drove by it and the nostalgia made me try it again with the fiance"}
{"text":"Parking is a mess, as many of them are reserved for people who are staying at the hotel. 
We had a 40 minute wait to get seated plus another hour for our food to get served. It was definitely not worth it in my opinion. We got the LoLo meal which only came with 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles priced at $15. The chicken was either too dry or too greasy. Popeyes and Church's chicken have better chicken. 
The only thing we enjoyed was the Kool-aid after years of not drinking it. 
I've had way better chicken and waffles at other locations with much faster service. 
Overall, this place is overrated."}
{"text":"First stop back in Phoenix been coming here off and on for 13 yrs great food better then spots in No Cal from the 916 and  work in Oak town San Fran  hard to find anything in this scale there"}
{"text":"Love this spot. I've always had great service. Be sure to check out the wait staff's t-shirts because they're unique and funny :)

I usually get the soul food platter because you get two meats and/or fish, two sides AND cornbread -- enough for left overs. My favorite sides are the greens, green beans and red potatoes, and fried okra. The Kool-Aid on tap with free refills is awesome. 

I love that it's family-owned and there are pics of them on the walls. Even the bathroom is pretty cool! 

Always great music playing and on the weekends they have a live DJ."}
{"text":"I love Lo-Lo's! I florist tried the location  South of downtown and was very happy when they opened in Scottsdale. They consistently provide great food with a smile. I recommend them to anyone who wants a little soul food in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The new location is just North of its old spot and is a LOT bigger.  The location is not all that's changed,  the menu has expanded,  there's a bar and outdoor seating.  What hasn't changed is the great food.

While they're still settling into this spot it's clear that they have a new success story. The chicken continues to be crunchy and very tasty,  it was literally steaming hot. Everything was very well done, helped along by Mike, a really friendly and attentive server.

We will be back."}
{"text":"My son and I had mixed reviews.  The chicken was a bit salty for my taste, hardly any crunch to the coating, nothing special to rave about.  The mac&cheese tastes just like Cracker Barrel, which I love. Potato Salad was AMAZING! Cornbread was blah, I make better. Sweet tea tasted like McDs - bag of sugar - Yuck!  My son had the blue Kool-Aid, that was really good. He said Waffle House, the ole greasy spoon, has better tasting waffles. I'm not a waffle fan, but had a bite - NOPE!  Parking is Valet because of the hotel right next to it or find your own. Good amount of food for the price. Service was just ok.  I would go back again and try more sides, but next time go to the Phx location, which was closed do to maintenance issues inside."}
{"text":"Mason jars of sweet tea done right, juicy and tender fried chicken with perfectly crispy skin, mac and cheese that doesn't teeter into absurd hoity-toityness, and waffles that are just thin enough to soak up the maximum amount of butter and syrup.

What's not to love?  Maybe the fact that I went from diabetic coma to sugar crash, skipping the high that usually comes in between.

I didn't even have room for red velvet, but that's a mistake I won't make twice."}
{"text":"Walked out after 20 minutes without a server stopping by our table. We didn't even get water.  Servers seemed to ignore us. We have been several times before and the food has been great. Service is terrible. We let the hostess know we were leaving and the manager followed us out and asked us to return but it was too late. We will not return."}
{"text":"This place is great! Food, service, atmosphere was great when we had breakfast on Friday morning. My chicken and waffles were tasty. My wife had a chicken omelette and it was great and enough for two. Be ready to eat! This place is great and we will be back when we are in town."}
{"text":"I finally went to Lo-Lo's yesterday for a late lunch or early dinner. After dreaming and hearing about it for years we visited the new Scottsdale location and were not disappointed. There was no wait. We did go off hours though. My guy tells me the place is always packed, so be forewarned.  We both got the Betty Boop and it was yummers. They have fantastic waffles here. Moist, with a hint of cinnamon! AWESOME! The chicken was delish. I loved the golden batter outside more than the chicken inside-teehee! The thing that really rocked it for me was the service! Outstanding! I love Carl. Carl rocks. His twin brother Micheal works there too.  In fact everyone treated us very welcoming, as house guests. Which kind of fits the down home, southern feel of the place.  I like it here very much and can't wait to go back, My diet can, but I can't- lol. Yes the food is not that good for you so it will have to be a once in a while splurge. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at Lo-Lo's after Disney on Ice about a week ago. We arrived on a Saturday night about 6 and to our surprise the place wasn't crowded..actually got a parking place right in front. When we walked in a woman yelled sit any where..then someone else yelled..y'all have to wait. so we waited..and waited. Mind you that several tables in plain view were available. After we were seated..without menus, we waited another 10 minutes before someone came back to the table with our menus..we didn't really need the menus for we have been to Lo-Lo's several times. Waited another 15 minutes for someone to take our order..a Betty Boop, a Tre Tre, a plain waffle for the child, 1 sweet tea, 1 unsweeted tea, 1 red kool-aid. Took another 10 minutes to get our drinks.  Again..not busy. The waitress brought out the Tre Tre and Betty Boop but not the waffle for our son..had to wait another 10 minutes to flag someone down to bring his waffle..long story short, the chicken and waffles were amazing as always, but the unsweeted tea was on the verge of souring..and the service was just plain awful. Lo-Lo's gets extremely buzy, especially on Sunday mornings and we have never had a problem, maybe it was an off night..but for the life of me I don't understand why it took us almost 2 hours for 3 pieces of fried chicken and 3 waffles."}
{"text":"I don't get all the hype surrounding chicken and waffles.  This is my second time trying it and I liked the waffle, and I liked the fried chicken, I just didn't think the combination was as orgasmic as other people seem to.  On another note, the corn bread is delicious!"}
{"text":"As I sit and WAIT after being told \"Don't stand at the door!\" by a grumpy \"hostess\"(?) THE moment I walked through it... I feel compelled to start writing my review as I pray that the food is even worth the 45 minute wait, after also being told by two people we could order drinks only to be told we in fact had to make our way back to the hostess stand,  order AND pay for drinks up front, THEN to be told \"well just wait for your table so it'll be easier for YOU to get drinks\"...

 We are finally (called party of 5 although we specifically said 6!) AND were refused addition of 1 person (five minutes after we walked in, unless we didn't mind being bumped to the bottom of the list?!?) 

Clearly by now, if I wasn't with 5 other folks I'd run for the hills... long story short, the food took over 30 mins, my drink came out with no ice (jack n pepsi) after my friend warned me to remove my straw as it had been excessively groped by a server... the waitress was clearly rushing and not focusing on a quality interaction despite our wait. 

I asked a gent if the grumpy lady up front was the owner and he said \"No, but I'm the manager\" and listened to a very succinct review of what we experienced during our first impressions of the Place.  I let him know we were all just visiting town and were just hopeful that the food would be \"on point.\" 

I toyed with the idea of trying the classic chicken n waffles (breast) because all great cooks know, a true culinary lover KNOWS how to make a juicy breast... instead I tried the #9- two thighs and a waffle.... only to be amazed that even the \"foolproof\" dark meat wasn't handled with care... soggy skin, lackluster-holiday-inn-style waffle... We were ALL ready for the check. 

Manager Joseph brought a fresh jack n pepsi for me, and the massive waste of food we left over is available for viewing in my \"AFTER\" photos attached to this review. .. 

Hey LOLo, if I wanted to pay for bad service I'd check out this place called \"Dicks\" where apparently some good (albeit vulgar) jargon is tossed at you on purpose... but I'd bet they could make a better plate of chicken n waffles even if they had their petrified grandpappy working the deep fat fryer in the back.... Too honest? Perhaps... but sadly this EXACTLY was what we experienced... Now I'm seriously going to question all four-star reviews I read in Yelp PHX, and that just makes me sad on a whole different level. Adios."}
{"text":"I am a BIG fan of chicken and waffles and I will try it just about anywhere it is served.  I especially love it in the morning; when everyone else is ordering a light breakfast, expect me to go for the fried chicken.

Lo-Lo's was just alright for me.  

I liked the chicken, but I was not fond of the waffles.  They were a little too... thin?  Light?  I dunno how to describe it, but I like my chicken AND my waffles to have a little crunch.  And there was kind of an interesting taste to the waffles.  I can't put my finger on the flavor.

I liked the atmosphere okay, but I probably won't be back.

I know Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe is not for everyone, but honestly I prefer the feel there.  It feels less \"affected\" by its customers, I guess.  For some reason I am finding it hard to come up with the words here, but Lo Lo's feels like it is the more popular cousin of Mrs. White's... you know... the one with the Letter in Football.

Anyway, I am glad Lo-Lo's is thriving...  Maybe I will try the Scottsdale location sometime to see if they have a different spin on things."}
{"text":"Being a white girl from Gilbert I never thought I would eat at a place that combines fried chicken with waffles.  The naive inner-workings of my brain caused by the culinary repression in the East Valley were so wrong.  So so wrong.  I will never forget the day I went to Lo-Lo's.

Sometimes when you combine two unexpected foods together you reach this special nirvana that you never thought possible.  For some people it is chocolate and bacon (tried that in a cupcake and did not like it) and for me, I reached the ultimate bliss with chicken and waffles.  May the clouds part and the gods sing hallelujah.

When the husband and I went, we tried to keep it traditional and ordered some fried chicken, some waffles, some mac and cheese, and some cornbread.  Lo-Lo's clearly believes in the mantra that butter is better.  Everything is loaded with it, and I love it.  The mac and cheese was intensely buttery and creamy, with just the right amount of \"mush\" in the macaroni to make it down home and comforting.  The chicken is crispy, crunchy, greasy and flavorful... exactly as it should be.  The waffles are thin, soft and buttery with a hint of spice.  The thin and piping hot maple syrup was served along with the waffles.  I found the best way to combine everything is to shred your chicken as best as you can, sprinkle it on top of your super-buttered waffles, douse it in syrup, and then dive in.  One bite of this and you know what I am talking about.

There is nothing wrong with this place.  It's hectic and loud with the cooks and servers yelling at each other, but it's comforting and peaceful in it's own special way when your server smiles and hands you your mason jar full of soda.  You want authentic?  Go here, and you can't go wrong.

Lo-Lo's, I will love you forever, my body be damned."}
{"text":"First time at the remodeled location, wow such a nice place almost drove by it. Actual parking lot instead of parking in the street. 
Chicken and Waffles are awesome and the Kool Aid in the retro flashback. If you have room for dessert their mile high cake is so good."}
{"text":"Love Lo Lo's and have been dining with them for a long time when they were in their original location before they upgraded the new downtown location and expanded to the 2nd location in Scottsdale. 

Tonight's experience was a little disappointing with the entire experience. First, Do not like the valet parking, the server was kidding but did not care for his sense of humor and most of all the Waffles and syrup was way below par.

The waffles were not as firm as would like, they were under cooked and almost soggy but the most disappointing thing was the obvious watering down of the syrup where there was hardly any syrup taste and no substance where it was the thickness of water.

When I asked the server what type of chicken I could get, he said \"fried\" in a smart a$$ way which pissed me off because I did not want white meat and just wanted to assure that I could get dark meat. Bruce then started to go on how he loved his job which I did not get the impression that he did.

The last item I did not care for was the valet which our car was parked right by the door, the valet asked me if I just wanted to pull it out myself and I said sure, but when I went to get in the other valet car was parked so close there was no way I could even open the door. Was not happy to see the other car parked so close and I tried to check if there were any scratches or dents but it was too dark.

Let me give Lo Lo's some feedback, your new restaurants are beautiful and impressive but your food is not living up to where it used to be, I would rather have the ghetto buildings and great quality food than the Foo Foo new nice buildings and the crap food and service that you have now."}
{"text":"Third time at this restaurant and although the first two visits were ok at best this day was enough to make me say I will NEVER go back to a Lo Lo's ever again, ever. The service was worse than horrible if this person wasn't purposely trying to run us off they couldn't have done a better job of it. And they had the chef in on it. The food I ordered came out incomplete and when I asked for the rest of what I had coming it seemed to annoy them and it still took ten more minutes for the rest of the order and even then they had to tell the cook to ruin it first. The place was not full but it took over thirty minutes for my order to show up, I see why this place wasn't full I don't know what more to say if they want to stay in business start by changing management and get some servers who want to work then a good cook might be a suggestion.
By by lo Lo's you won't be waiting my time ever again."}
{"text":"After a fun, alcohol filled night, my friends and cousins decide to hit up LoLo's.  I hadn't been here since they were just a back room to somebody's kitchen so seeing the expansion gave me high hopes because it presented itself nicely...the interior is the ONLY thing that presents itself well.

We walk in and the unenthusiastic hostess asked how many was in our party and I told her 8.  Being that the rest of the party live further, it would take them a while, so she informed us she can't seat half of our party until the full 8 showed up. Ugh yeah, right. I'm hungry and I'm not waiting so we just asked to be seated for our four. So after letting her know it would just be us for, she writes my name and instructs me to \"scoot\"  to the side and sit down. In slow motion, I turn around and all of the waiting benches are taken soooo where the hell am I suppose to sit, on the older ladies lap that was already sitting there?! She could have easily said \"it will just be a few moments, if you'd like you can take a seat that's available behind you\". Was that too difficult?! So I say whatever, they sat us within the next two minutes.

Our waiter/manager of the restaurant takes our drink orders and he seemed pretty cool cuz he was joking a lil with us.  So my cousin asks if she can put in an order for someone who was showing up a little later and then that's when things went down hill.  We were informed we couldn't do that because it would be cold by the time he came and blah blah blah.  Brotha, that's another order which results into money into your business' pocket.  So we order our food but he let's us order for our cousin who would show up late.  So we place the order and literally 5 minutes later, a different server comes out and says \"UM this is for someone showing up late or somethin\".  Ok, so you mean to tell me there was a discussion about this tiny little request in your kitchen amongst several servers.  Not to mention our order hadn't even come out yet, so the \"complicated\" order was first to come out when our orders were the smallest.  My friend asks why my cousins order came out so fast and why we haven't received ours, so that's when the title of this review comes in \"ma'am we cook chicken and waffles all day, some orders will be quicker than others\". Huh?! I know I didn't major in computer science but this really wasn't THAT complex.  So luckily my cousin walks in just in time to eat his food so it didn't get cold like Mr. Manager/Waiter/Host/Fry Cook (he seriously wore many hats) mentioned. 

I don't wanna come to a place to eat when there's all these rules and instructions beginning with who and how many people can sit with me.  Being a California native, Roscoe's will always be THE Chicken & Waffles place that dominates any other competition.  Compared to Roscoe's, this place is amateur.  At least with Scoes they seat you no matter what time your party arrives, your food comes out within 5-10 minutes from the time you place your order, and you have a server who is just that...a server.  Not the building instructor, valet attendant or whatever our so called 'server' was to us.  This place will never get my business ever again."}
{"text":"I have fantasized about the idea of chicken and waffles for quite some time now, and Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles was all that I hoped for and more!  The chicken and waffles, cornbread, sweet potatoes, mac 'n cheese, grits and kool-aid were amazing! The restaurant itself is really cute too.  Very creative decor.  Such a fun, delicious dinner experience!"}
{"text":"I really really enjoyed the food here! Great service! I had the Chicken Strips, waffle, and collared greens, and it was awesome. I'll be back for sure! Be careful with the iced tea, I had half n half and damn, it was still really sweet! Overall A+ experience!"}
{"text":"This is the only place I'll go when I'm craving Southern comfort. It's also the only fried chicken my son will eat! The food and staff are amazing and I'll always be a return customer."}
{"text":"LoLo's will not dissapoint. From the corn bread to collard greens to mac n cheese. 
chicken n waffles is their staple but theyve got so much more. stupid fries are crwzy good. bring ur appetitie and order a big jar of purple kool aid or sweet tea. too bad they dont have a spot in the west valley. 
love this place."}
{"text":"Never had chicken so dry and salty before...I don't think I will be coming back here. Service was also horrible! I'll be sticking to Roscoe's."}
{"text":"This is a review that has been in the making for quite some time.  This review is for the THIS location.  This is a 3.5 Star review, but I can't give them a 3.

I will cut to the chase and save most of my comments for the Phoenix/Original location.  LoLo's is down right good chicken and great waffles.

This location seems to not be as busy as the flagship location in downtown.  But, please don't think that means that this location is not busy.  At lunch time, if you arrive before noon or after 1:30, you will stand your best chance to be seated right away.  On the weekends, fa'git about it, you'll wait.  its worth it. 

I order the exact same thing Every time I go.  I rarely change my order.  I order a Tre Tre with blue koolaid.  When I first started going, they didn't have the blue koolaid, so I ordered the red koolaid.  On a couple of occasions, I was feeling snazzy, so I ordered the Toy Toy.  The Tre  Tre is similar to the Toy Toy.  Both have 2 pieces of chicken and a waffle.  Tre Tre - Drumsticks.  Toy Toy - Wings.  The chicken is hot and crispy.  I have had it a time or two and thought that perhaps it had been cooked and sitting in a warmer too long.  The waffles are extremely good.  I enjoy putting a little of the butter and a lot of the syrup on mine and eating my waffle from the inside out!  YUMMY!   I haven't had much else on the menu, but I've sampled the plates of folks I've been with and their food was good.  I was in there a couple of weeks ago and I see that they have added several new items to the menu.  I want to try the shrimp and grits.

The thing about this location that I like is that the service is always friendly and prompt.  This is the only place in Phoenix for chicken and waffles.  I love being waited on by a couple of guys that work there.  they are twins.  Mr C and Mr D (if I recall correctly).  Those are some nice fellas.

I have tried their Red Velvet Cake and I was somewhat surprised to find that it was a decent contender for what I would call a good Red Velvet Cake.  It doesn't rival my 1st and 2nd favorite RVC's in phoenix.  The texture of this cake is exactly moist enough and the cream cheese icing tastes creamy and sweet.  The one thing their RVC is missing is the taste of the cake.  The hint of the chocolate is not there.  I DO NOT like the raw nuts on the cake, but I can eat around that.  

All in all, LoLo's is the \"only\" spot to get  chicken and waffles in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is a review that has been in the making for quite some time.  This review is for the THIS location.  This is a 3.5 Star review, but I can't give them a 3.

I will cut to the chase and save most of my comments for the Phoenix/Original location.  LoLo's is down right good chicken and great waffles.

This location seems to not be as busy as the flagship location in downtown.  But, please don't think that means that this location is not busy.  At lunch time, if you arrive before noon or after 1:30, you will stand your best chance to be seated right away.  On the weekends, fa'git about it, you'll wait.  its worth it. 

I order the exact same thing Every time I go.  I rarely change my order.  I order a Tre Tre with blue koolaid.  On a couple of occasions, I was feeling snazzy, so I ordered the Toy Toy.  The Tre  Tre is similar to the Toy Toy.  Both have 2 pieces of chicken and a waffle.  Tre Tre - Drumsticks.  Toy Toy - Wings.  The chicken is hot and crispy.  I have had it a time or two and thought that perhaps it had been cooked and sitting in a warmer too long.  The waffles are extremely good.  I enjoy putting a little of the butter and a lot of the syrup on mine and eating my waffle from the inside out!  YUMMY!   I haven't had much else on the menu, but I've sampled the plates of folks I've been with and their food was good.  I was in there a couple of weeks ago and I see that they have added several new items to the menu.  I want to try the shrimp and grits.

I was reading another Yelper's (Tigra C) review and realized, the only vegetable that I've ever tried at LoLo's is the fried green tomatoes and the fried pickles... oh and the french fries. I'm pretty sure that those 3 things do not constitute vegetables anymore.  LOL welp, I will consider the spinach the next time.

{"text":"I visit Lo-Lo's not often enough...But it's actually just the right number of times.  You can only eat so many carbs and fried things with sugary drinks every so often.

If you're coming to Lo-Lo's on an evening, especially nearer the weekend, be prepared to wait for your table. It's worth it, but also make sure everyone in your party is going to be there in time. They won't seat you unless your entire party is present.

I usually order the red kool-aid...I don't even know which flavor it is, but recently I've switched over to an Arnold Palmer with unsweetened tea to cut down on the sugar intake.  Can't go wrong with kool-aid though, seriously.

Fried okra is a must- I've recently started dipping it in ranch instead of my usual ketchup and it's delicious. Get the Betty Boop (breast and waffle) or if you don't want to deal with bones and want more meat, get the chicken tenders with the waffle. Pour some hot sauce on your chicken, syrup on your waffle and get one bite with the spicy, crunchy chicken and a bit of sweet, fluffy waffle. A weird combo, but so good! 

Also...GET STUPID FRIES! They sound weird, but they're delicious. Seasoned fries, sautéed peppers and onions, chicken, savory gravy- it's like a version of poutine and super filling. Get an order to share!"}
{"text":"The food was really good! The service was lacking though and their sweet tea is disgusting. Literally tasted like I was drinking a cup of sugar water. They need a lesson in that but I haven't really found any place out here on the west coast that knows how to make sweet tea anyway lol."}
{"text":"The red velvet cake is too die for. However they forgot my order with my jobs huge order we placed. The chicken was decent and the macaroni was great. Lucikly the portions are so big you can share. I would try them once more time. Overall its hug portions for your price."}
{"text":"Best Gizzards I've had since I was a kid. Delicious.  Our server was awesome too. Thanks Brad!!"}
{"text":"The food raves are largely warranted, but what further separates Lo-Lo's is the service and multiracial atmosphere, which can be hard to come by in Phoenix.  Before I'd walked halfway across the street from our car towards the restaurant, we were acknowledged by an outdoor hostess. A couple minutes later, she beckoned us from inside the front door to \"Come on in\"  - as if this were a special clubhouse or night spot.  

Inside, our waitress was friendly and knowledgable and a tag team staff is always breezing by, anticipating needs: refills, napkins, defibrillators.  A couple tables over, they fussed over an elderly patron like bees on a honeycomb.   

There's a pleasant and thoroughly Black self confidence about Lo-Lo's that's, I dont know...affirming.  They're good at what they do, and treat everybody the same- which is quite well - even if you're a patronizing N. Phx yuppie on your annual sociological trek down to the hood.  We were the only Anglos in our area, and felt welcome and thoroughly taken care of. 

Righteous chicken, laughably huge waffles. Lunch here and you may not eat again til breakfast.  Not fancy, but fine.  Worth a special trip."}
{"text":"My wife and I are from Los Angeles and vacation in Phoenix a couple of times a year for the past 4 years. Her friend told us about lo lo's and we decided to try it out and loved it , last month we decided to go to Phoenix with a couple of friends and her mom and they all loved it too. If u are ever in Phoenix u must try lo lo's chicken and waffles out"}
