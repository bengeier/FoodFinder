{"text":"Great Asian restaurant used by many locals. Lunch just under $5 and Early dinner just under $6."}
{"text":"Best takeout in the area. Loyal customer for 25+ years.  Great appetizers, House Special Fried Rice, House Special Chicken is amazing!   JoyR"}
{"text":"I've traveled all over the Far East, and I found the dishes prepare in this Chinese restaurant outstanding. The food is always delivered hot,  the service is excellent, and the staff is courteous and attentive. The chow mein is superb,  along with the beef & broccoli. It's all good.  This is a dining experience you won't want to miss"}
{"text":"I order from them once a month when visiting. I usually get the vegetarian options and ask for no MSG. Our family likes the fried rice, seafood soup and wonton soup. We usually always order out and pick up. It's close, inexpensive and tasty."}
{"text":"Great traditional Chinese food! We will be regulars."}
{"text":"We are very happy with Nan Jing.  their combinations are very filling, delicious and modestly priced.  A couple can each have a combination meal including an entre, soup, deep fried pork, white or brown rice and a spring roll for under $20.00  We order take-out from them every 2 weeks on average and will continue to do so.  xie xie"}
{"text":"I picked up a carry out order last night as my first visit to this restaurant. The meal was a  combo menu item of Szechuan shrimp and chicken. I got home and discovered that the meal must have been taken from a steam-table like in a buffet. The food was tired looking, the vegetables over cooked and mostly colorless. The shrimp were over cooked and gray in color. There was a runny liquid which was supposed to be the sauce. The chicken was breaded. The breading was greasy. The spring roll or whatever it was, was way over cooked and greasy. There are lots of Chinese restaurants, I would look elsewhere the next time I get the urge."}
{"text":"on the outside, this place look like all the other mom and pop Chinese food joint. \"China this.\".. \"Dragon that \" type of restaurant. I wasn't particularly interested going in except  friends I was with had been there before, they couldn't stop praising how good this place was. (besides they are buying, so I didn't have much to say)   Once inside, The decor is much better than the typical mom and pop, not elegant, but better than the average Chinese joint. Look clean.  Personally I don't the the Americanized version of Chinese food. I much rather have Hong Kong style Chinese food. I find their food is Americanized yet retain authentic Chinese food flavor - surprise me. For that reason, I give them a four star. Other than that, this place is pretty much like all the other mom and pop joint.  Over all, I think it is good food, good value."}
{"text":"I love chinese food and I think this place is one of the best! Great food, great atmosphere, great service. Everything from the appetizers and soup, to the meals are wonderful! I don't think the place is too pricy either. Really, I think this place is amazing and if you're craving chinese food and are in the area, you should definitely eat here."}
{"text":"We really love Nanjing ... not fancy and good food and good prices. Decent glass of wine or a beer to enjoy with your meal won't break the bank!  We probably go at least once a month."}
{"text":"Tasteless watered down sauce. Canned vegetables. Hardly any meat. No way to use chop sticks with this food. The pieces are cut to small to pick up with anything but a spoon. The only thing positive is the price. It's cheap and that's probably why people come to this place."}
{"text":"We just ordered out for hot & sour soup, and it was great. One of the best we've had here in Phoenix. Ordered again...not better, but worse"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!!! Especially the pepper steak. The fried rice that comes with the meal is a little dry, so I would always switch it out to the white rice. Their crab puffs and dumplings are excellent too."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been going since my baby was born and now she is 5. They treat you like family. Are not heavy on soy sauce which is good for a lot of people. Great food and service. Orders are always right. Eat here about 3-4 Times a month."}
{"text":"Flavorless...... Kung Pao Chicken is suppose to be spicy right? Well not here... and where's the chicken... had more peanuts than chicken. Egg roll tasted as if it had been in freezer forever. Soda was flat,rice was dry. Would not be so bad, but i was one of maybe two other customers.......Sad really.Gave two stars because my waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"we have been customers of nan jing for years.  we have noticed the last time we went in that the food was not that tasty and it took forever to get service. but on fri april 7th we went there around five thirty waited 10 min for a server and i had to flag down one. i told her we were ready and she just nodded and walked away.  no offer of drink, soup, etc, i flagged her again she came over pissed that she had to take order, after about 20 min i flagged one of them and motioned that i would like some tea? she laughed and mocked me with her hand imitating drinking tea. the other laughed also. i was done,, told the gal at counter that we were leaving and never come back again. she said the tea machine was broken and should of told us that. no apology for mocking a customer.  done,,,,done  done.  you are ungrateful deplorable place of business"}
{"text":"Had a hankering for szechwan food, and this was the closest to that we could find near El Mirage.  The food was ok, but nothing special...kind of bland and boring, but not bad."}
{"text":"I have been going to Nan Jing since before i can remember, it's a place where my family enjoys going.We always order the same thing every time we go. Occasionally we will try something new, and yes i have found their pot stickers are amazing !!!!! . The portions are enough to feed a family of four. We order the sesame chicken and four egg rolls, it comes with rice and a fresh pot of tea. I always get the side of chips to eat with the red sauce.  They have changed the way they make it , the egg rolls are smaller, and the chicken pieces are smaller . Even though that's how it is , i will still go their forever ."}
{"text":"Found my Chinese restaurant and very close to new house!  Just finished take out dinner with my husband.  It was GREAT.  We have been to Hong Kong and appreciate real Chinese food.  This may be a touch Americanized as the flavor was perfect and complex. Husband had shrimp fried rice and I had Moo shu pork.  We got 6 \"pancakes\" for the moo sho and the plum sauce was delicious and not too sweet.  Fried rice very tasty but not a lot of shrimp.  Food was steaming hot and the prices were extremely reasonable (important on a fixed income.)  We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I'm glad I came here. I almost didn't based on the reviews. It's not the best Chinese food I've ever had but it's not bad. It is kind of bland but that's why God invented sweet and sour sauce and soy sauce. I got my order for carry out and it was fast (like 5 minutes) and when I got it home it was very hot. The service was super friendly and quick and the restaurant looked pretty clean.  My only complaint is that my fortune cookie was crushed.   Early bird special with tip, less than ten bucks.   I'll be back."}
{"text":"Well went there today and was not impressed yes lunch prices were inexpensive but food was not great! Egg drop soup was accompanied by 2 tiny black bugs, possibly gnat or ant variety, before discovery taste of soup was very bland! Had lo mein and it was eatable but nothing more!! We are still searching for a good Chinese restaurant in this area, even yelp has been misleading!"}
{"text":"We've ordered from Nan Jing many times, my grandmother loves it. It's a little too bland for my taste. Nothing bad to say...just nothing Simi exciting to add about the food either."}
{"text":"Quality stuff. This is not your americanized chinese food, and the previous reviews reflect that. This is real chinese food and the staff is not rude, its just that they dont know much english.   My party of 3 went here last night and we had the chefs family dinner for 3.  That was a TON of great food for $10.95 each! It was awesome. They have wor wonton soup, which i have never had before and was better than just wonton soup with all the veggies. I do kinda want more meat in it though.  The sweet and sour chicken was great, mongolian beef was spicy, and the fried rice was excellent.  A great deal for some real chinese."}
{"text":"I've only had a couple of dishes here carry out & liked them.  It's not a restaurant that I return to frequently, but I do like the food that I've had there.  I've had one of their tofu dishes & something else (can't remember)."}
{"text":"First off it's been awhile second , there was no green tea no Dr. Pepper or Chile oil , third the rice was burnt and those damn ladies that work there are rude and so loud when stacking dishes it hard to enjoy being there .. when the man from the back brought out the food I told him I had the Mongolian beef and he stared laughing and when I asked why laugh about my food he walked away .. I will never go back the food and service is shitty don't waste your money even if it's a $6 lunch .. way better places out there and these bitches suck .. they are very rude and the food is not worth it honestly idk if it was even beef .. we walked out paying for soup and drinks only we will never return and I will never let anyone I care about go there ..and the rice was dark brown with black burnt tasting flakes.."}
{"text":"Wow we are here to review food people.... get a life.  The food here is amazing! i'll never eat another chinese again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to go here often when we lived in Surprise. It was good food for a decent price. I havent been here in a few years but i was craving the Hot and Sour soup so we decided to pick up an order to go. This place has really gone downhill. They have skimped on the food and the quality is poor. The sop used to have nice chunk of tofu, shrimp and beef - well not anymore. All it is is fatty beef broth with barely anything inside it. We also order the Mongolian Beef and found that there was barely any beef and lots of green onions. I will not go back to this place, unfortunately they have lost our business."}
{"text":"There is nothing great or nothing bad about this place.  So, I have to say that I am very  disappointed  that it wasn't spectacular!  I was really hoping that I would finally find a Chinese restaurant not too far from home that I would fall in love with.  I ordered the Mongolian beef combination plate.  It comes with rice, egg roll, soup and sweet and sour pork.  The beef was fine.  The rice was a little on the dry side.  The portions were fine, you won't leave hungry.  My dish cost about $8.  The service was good. I really hope I find a Chinese restaurant that I love soon on the west side."}
{"text":"Four stars for clean, three stars for the wall relief or sculpture or whatever, two stars for the food.  And food is what I went there for.  Scratch this one off my list."}
{"text":"Chinese food the way Mom used to make it; right out of a TV dinner tray. OK not that bad. Merely nondescript, bland, tasteless. Unless you get the ribs on a hot summer night and they're rancid. The runny lobster sauce on the four tiny shrimp ain't  much better.  I came here a few times with the \"Mayor\" of Sun City Festival . Is he getting free meals for bringing people in?  Aside from awful food, the people who work in this place are rude to the point of belligerence and act as if they could care less if you ever come again."}
{"text":"Okay so Panda Express sucks more than this place, if that gives you any idea of the quality and taste."}
{"text":"Very disappointing meal. There were very few vegetarian options, so I ordered the vegetable chow mein. There were no noodles, just a plate of broccoli, water chestnuts, celery and a few mushrooms. Worst Chinese food I have had. The other people in my party were not happy with their food either. Very bland and poor quality."}
{"text":"Food is just average, and the decor is exactly what you'd expect in a strip mall Chinese joint. If you are going to eat here, be sure to order take out, cause the staff is very rude and seems like you are bothering them every time you ask them a question."}
{"text":"I love this place I go at least 4 times a month. I get the beef and broccoli and it is made in a great sauce. I do not like the taste of soy and fortunately for me this sauce does not taste like soy at all. Their portions for dinner are huge and their lunch portions with the combo are always perfect size. I highly recommend Nan Jing!"}
{"text":"Just tried to eat an order I picked up fom Nan Jing.  I can unequivocally state that this was the worst Asian food I have ever tried to eat.  If I had not been famished, I would have thrown this gruel away and gone to Jacks.  All because I was too lazy to drive the 2 additional miles to Saigon Kitchen.  I will not set foot or tongue in this place again and you shouldn't either."}
{"text":"A great session at a good Chinese restaurant. Service was very quick and complete. We had steamed vegetables, sweet & sour pork, and sesame beef after some outstanding hot and sour soup. For three, the meal cost less than 40 dollars. We will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Never again, used to be our go to place. Gave it a couple more chances over the last two months, same old watered down sauce, no flavor! Kung Pao Chicken??? More like Kung Pao Peanuts in a white watery sauce! Forget about it!"}
{"text":"Not that awesome. Prices are super inexpensive, but the food is only so so. Service is good. I may give them another try."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch, the prices, servings and flavor are a 3-4. We recently went for dinner and got one of the special meals that includes an assortment of different items, it actually was better than  lunch! Portions are huge, we bought stuff home for later! The hot and sour soup is quite good, we got 2 entrees, appetizer and rice...best was the broccoli beef, ask them to do it spicy..."}
{"text":"Egg foo yong portion was very small, tasteless and rice was dried out and old. They even only gave one fortune cookie!"}
{"text":"Meh. Too many old folks using the place as a phone booth for it to be an enjoyable experience.    Food was decent.  Not much flavor to anything overall and far from vegetarian friendly.  Second time here and thought the first time was just an 'off day'."}
{"text":"New to the area and was looking for some good Chinese food. Someone recommended this place. It was really good and service was fast and friendly. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times. The lunch specials are pretty consistent and a good value. Specials come with a crab puff. Egg roll, white or fried rice, and tea. I upgrade their soup which costs an extra dollar to hot and sour soup. Their wonton soup is delicious too. The hostess and servers are not overly friendly but do recognize repeat guests. Is it the best Chinese food in the area? No, but it's convenient  and won't break your bank. The only real problem is the restrooms need attending to. Put a fresh coat of paint or clean them on a daily basis please!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive for the early bird special.  $5.55 for the combination plates that include egg roll, soup, rice, and your selection.  If the food only had more seasoning or flavor?  It was very bland and flavorless.  I usually do not use soy sauce, but needed to use it to add something to my dish.    Neat features: Koi pond inside with a bridge over it."}
{"text":"Been coming here over 2 years  Really good hot tea There soups are all good The combination fried rice is a good 2 person meal We always get the combo's Because some come with fried shrimp 2 small pieces yummy  Or some combos come with spring roll  Both really yummy along side a small bowl Sweet n  sour pineapple fried pork Combos are filling Yummy Always our go to place"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving them a four on the rating is because they had my favorite soup, Sizzling Rice, on the menu but it had pork in it!   I tried this place just last night for the first time, thinking I was going to the Chinese Restaurant (Peking Gourmet) that I normally go to in the area, but this one is practically across the street. I have a horrible time remembering names, unless I repeat it over and over until it sticks!   Overall, this place was really great! They have cute bridge that goes over the top of this pond with really tiny fish in it! The place is pretty well lit and very clean looking. They have a combination of modern and ancient Chinese decor, which was nice!   As for food and beverages, they kept the hot tea coming and the the Crab Puffs, were pipping hot and not overly crabby or grossly creamy! General Tso's and Sweet and Sour Chicken were also very yummy! Oh and the lil Honey drizzled Wonton-ed Bananas they give you for dessert, on top of fortune cookies, also were really good.  It's hard to find great Chinese food restaurants here in the valley, because of my spoiled San Franciscan tongue, but this place will probably be one of my new haunts because I enjoyed it all so much!"}
{"text":"My search for great Chinese food in Surprise AZ remains unfulfilled. Nan Jing is simply Meh Chinese. Ok pot stickers and the Mongolian beef I had was all right but the two chili peppers I found in it didn't succeed in achieving its \"spicy\" promised on the menu. Average at best."}
{"text":"We have been eating here for years. I am as picky of a new yorker as they get (with food). I will say we do not eat there Monday or Tuesday's, The cook must be different, its not as good on those days. The rest of the week is 5 stars all the way.Great sesame chicken,fried rice, lo mien etc. Highly suggest."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, my veggies were obviously out of a can.  The quality has really gone down hill, kind of bummed because it's very close to where we stay in SCW. Sorry guys, more than likely won't be back."}
