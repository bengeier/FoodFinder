{"text":"Went to this place In search for Jollof rice in Brampton. I am guessing there are many variations of jollof rice which I was unaware of until I came here. ( I'm used to Nigerian jollof rice ).

This place was yummy though and their rice was infused with lots of spice. Their suya is delicious as well. 

The food is light and it fills you up but doesn't.  make you feel like you need to take a nap on the floor due to itis hehe."}
{"text":"Come here often to get the suya steak wrap. A must try if you haven't already. Staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"Food is quite good
Portions very small for $
Coleslaw side 4+$?? C'mon. It's 4oz!!
Won't be around long if this continues unfortunately 

Perhaps an error was made on the order as it was pick up then?"}
{"text":"Prices increase, Portions decrease
I actually used to love this place. I was one of their first customers; however, I've noticed that the portions have gotten incredibly small, while prices continue to go up. Last week I bought the Suya steak and chicken combo which used to consist of three pieces of chicken and chopped steak. This time, the chicken I received was one small drumstick cut in half! Along with that just a few pieces of steak -- for $13.00!!! I really hope this piece gets itself back in order -- I really used to love it!"}
{"text":"So I heard about this place from a friend who says the food is bangin'.  Being a connoisseur of fine West African food, I had to try this place since I was visiting the GTA.  

At first, I noticed the absence of the basic West African fare from the menu: jollof rice, moin moin, fried plantain...I started to panic.  Then I noticed this item: \"Orisirisi\" which translates to variety from the Yoruba language.  I had to get it.  I also tried a fried rice and suya + chicken combo and a wrap.  A lot of food, yes, but this is how I roll when I am testing.  

The Food.
It is dubbed Afro-Asian, which is spot on.  The Orisirisi is succulent pieces of tripe, pomo (cow skin), kidney and other assorted pieces drenched in a wet spicy sauce.  On a scale of one to 10, it's 11.  the only thing missing is a bottle of 'lanko' to wash it down.

Then the suya.  Authenticity is 99%, which is about as high as you can get outside of the mallam under the fruit tree at the junction.       

The wrap is delicious.  And you can have it with suya, chicken and other things.  Very nice and inexpensive, perfect for a quick bite.  It's actually cheap because the lunch special is $5.50 and it comes with a drink.  

The fried rice is really designer fried rice, very hot/spicy and delicious.  

If you are anywhere close to this place, even if you are far, you owe yourself a visit.  This is West African food with a much need remix.  

Now how can I get one of these to the US?"}
{"text":"Last year, I had friends rave about this place and I thought to myself, how amazing can this wrap place be?! I went in one day, asked the chef what he would suggest; he said try the Suya steak. After that first try, I dream about the Suya steak now from time to time. Its a beautiful wrap with homemade dressing, grilled veggies, a little cheese, and tender good-quality steak which has been grilled with an African Suya spice blend. A wicked highlight is that all the spices are the chefs own line you can also pick up at local grocery stores.

Everything is made fresh, so you will have to wait 5-7 minutes sometimes. It is definitely well worth the wait.

The staff is really friendly, chef has a great story, and the place is spotless. This place is definitely a good eats.

{"text":"The food is well done! The spices and herbs are well infused to give the rice they serve a distinct taste. Definitely would recommend to those who want food that's spicy - not mild. Also the suya steak goes with pretty much anything they offer on the menu."}
{"text":"Hanging out at the Powerade Centre with the daughter and I needed some better lunch options. Yelp search results came up with Get Grill. The chicken Suya wrap was fantastic!  I should have got the large. Was my first introduction to Suya food and it made a great first impression. Thanks to the staff for walking me thru the options and making recommendations. Wish I lived/worked nearer to the restaurant, but it would be worth going out of the way for."}
{"text":"I skipped breakfast this morning so I was ravenous. I ordered a large Shombo chicken wrap and a side order of Shombo grilled veggies. I did not need the side of veggies. The large wrap is huge and stuffed full of chicken. It was incredibly filling. Luckily the grilled veggies are equally delicious at room temp so they'll make a great evening snack/meal if I ever feel hungry again (feels doubtful now given how full I still am). 

This place is so amazing."}
{"text":"Heard so many great things about this place, had to try it, but to my disappointment I found it basic. Nothing special except the prices, I paid $2.75 for 2 small pieces of shrimp, whatever you do when ordering your meal don't do any add ons as they are over priced and under deliver. But the staff was friendly I just wish they would educate you on What your ordering, as my single lunch meal cost me $19.46 and they wanted to charge me .75 cents for extra hot sauce. Next time I come if I come back I will stick to the days they have specials as the portions are small and the prices are big ! But in fairness the food wasn't that bad it was okay, and something easily I can make at home ."}
{"text":"my brother always grabs wraps from this location and never is there a complain.

i walked in, undecided with what i wanted because there were so many awesome choices.

i decided to go with the jerk chicken wrap and the butter chicken one (both snack sides). it's so delicious - i have had their vegetarian option before too and it does not disappoint.

when i turned around to order my meal i realized that one of the owners was a precious staff member of mine. she came from behind the counter to greet me. 

i remember when we worked together over 5 years ago how enthusiastic she was about opening her own restaurant and how much passion she had for food, needless to say, they've done an amazing job with the fusion of food, i can't wait until they open again after the holidays! i was even more happy to hear she'll be franchising the place and the next location to open will be at hurontario and dundas!

Congratulations Tobi & family! your service and food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Under priced and excellent food. It's a small place. Only take outs. Try the suya chicken wrap for the people who love chilly spicy food. Others can try the jerk chicken, very flavorful spice. It isn't pepper hot. 
Always coming to this place whenever I vist Toronto."}
{"text":"The food at this place is amazing! The meat is well seasoned and the wraps are fantastic. The customer service is good, the servers/cashiers are usually really friendly. This is a busy restaurant so it's best to order your food and then pick it up. The food is very filling, you're going to go into a food coma after eating a meal from this place, yes it's that good! The only thing is, the food is priced at a high point compared to the food you receive. I feel like I should be able to get a bit more food for the price that I am paying. Good restaurant overall. Bigger wraps would be nice. Check it out, I hope you find this useful!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. First time was awhile ago, but I believe I had Suya beef with fried rice. The fried rice was intentionally Asian-style as the chef/owner says it's fusion based. The beef was absolutely delicious: very high quality meat and delicious with spicy suya seasoning. If you haven't tried suya, consider it a priority as it's a wonderful taste and a building heat which I love. Towards the end you'll really feel it. The rice was pretty good, but it was a bit oily which scales my review down a bit.

The next time I went in, I had a Suya beef wrap, and I think wraps are their bread and butter (so to speak). The beef was as described above, and it came with a nice cream-based sauce and some veggies. I feel it could've used a few more veggies, but great overall. I also tried a friend's chicken wrap which was also great. Everything is also cooked and prepared fresh, including the meat which is very important. They can prepare it at any spice level, and if you're a heat-seeker, they can really give you some pretty intense heat if you want it.

On the wraps alone, I'd probably give it 5 stars. I was debating whether to give it a 4 over the rice which wasn't perfect; however this is probably the best wrap you'll get in town, so I'll go with a 5 overall. There's a tonne of flavour options as they create (and sell) their own spices. Something different for adventurous types, but many options to keep it accessible for most. I wish it was a bit closer to me, as I'd probably go more often, but still highly recommended."}
{"text":"kay, so i checked the reviews for a spot nearby since i was early for volleyball and this place popped up. please don't think i'm a douche but FOR ME, this place was just a-ok. 

i got a dinky wrap for $7.50 which i guess is reasonable...

real small joint, walk in, no real sit down (two bar stools) 

i wanted a chicken wrap but she told me they only had spicy chicken, i can handle a bit of spice okay...so i asked her, how spicy is spicy? she says well its spicy but you don't need water or anything....so i thought to myself and said, you can handle it...jus order it and stop being a little princess

well, this sh*t was spicy and i DID NEED WATER, lots of it actually lol 

BUUUUT it was good okay....freshly made...and good, i will give this place another try one day if i have vball there but no more spicy for me"}
{"text":"Good food and interesting concept for interior decor. The wait time was a little long and the outlet was a little too compact for my liking.

I loved the Jerk chicken wrap I had. Good taste and the spices are awesome. The only minus point is that the wait was too long and I lost the lunch break. Other than that I would still go back to get dose of that spice.

Nothing to complain about the staff and they didn't make that much contact with us either.

The decor was interesting with a dark wood and chillies for decor.

Three stars are for the amazing wrap I had."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, there's this one girl they hired recently who is incompetent but if you can wait 20 minutes I promise you it's the tastiest thing you may ever have"}
{"text":"Afro Asian Cuisine isn't the first thing that comes to anyone's mind when they are deciding what to eat for lunch or dinner.  Well after trying Get Grill I almost guarantee it will pop into your mind from time and time again.  I found Get Grill in one Yelp searches for places to eat in my area.  As soon as i saw Afro Asian i had no idea what it was bu I knew i had to try it.  Its a very tiny place with very high volume of people.  I didn't realize until I got there or else i would have pre-ordered my food.  Upon my arrival I was a bit over whelmed by the amount of people jammed in such a small place.  The girl that took my order was very helpful and suggest what i should try for my first time visiting the restaurant.  I ordered the Suya Steak dinner.  No idea what I ordered all I know it was spicy steak with rice so how can I go wrong lol.  My order too half an hour to be prepared as they were extremely busy.  In the half hour i was there the amount of people that came in and out was insane.  The wait was killing me I was starving an super anxious to try the mystery dinner I ordered lol.  There are only 5 or 6 seats there so I took my meal home.  Finally when I got home I was able to try my dinner.  The smell was insane.  The small box was loaded with so much flavor that my taste buds were on over load.  It was spicy, salty, sweet all of the above.  At first I wasn't sure if i liked it or not but as I kept eating I realized that I was enjoying it and left me wondering what the rest of the menu tasted like.  I am sure I will find out soon enough lol."}
{"text":"I went here for the Suya beef and I was so excited, only to receive about six pieces of beef for $11.30.  I had to drive back and ask if I received the correct order! It looked like an appetizer.

I bet the wraps and meals may look worth it, but buying the suya beef by itself is definitely a rip-off.  Since the price point is higher than the wrap, I expected more meat!  I have never seen such a paltry amount of meat for $11.30.  I cannot believe it."}
{"text":"Best wraps place in Brampton, well maintained and great quality food. Everything is delicious. If you love wraps, you need to try this place. All their Flavours are amazing."}
{"text":"If you want talk to nice people this may be the place for you!

Food tastes great but the size of portion is ridiculously small. I honestly have never seen such small chicken in my life.

I once ordered the suya steak meal and it was tiny!

I wish I could say I will be back. But it's over priced for very little food.

I like their wraps but you need to eat 2 to get full and the price is to high for so little. They have some daily deal which is no deal at all.. You get a wrap and pop for like 7 and change. They should offer any 2 large wraps for 10bucks an get a following.

Bang for buck... Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Get Grill is a Suya Spot for anyone who's looking to get some in the area. There aren't many restaurants to get Suya across the GTA, let alone Brampton, so it's good that Get Grill is serving it up around the community. For anyone who's curious, suya is like the West African version of a kebab, that's grilled with West African spices and generally pretty damn spicy. The menu consists of gourmet wraps and meals that come with a side such as rice, jollof rice, veggies, or potatoes.

I ordered up the Suya Steak and Chicken with Jollof rice (West African jambalaya). The steak was sliced nicely and is pretty nice quality. The meat was tender, but the spices were a bit much. The chicken was even better. It was like a quarter chicken with the white meat, but this was the most tender chicken breast I've had in quite some time. The meat was so easy to cut through and I was using a plastic fork!? The chicken tastes great too as the skin wasn't overbearing with spice and worked well with the onions and peppers. The jollof rice was way too spicy for me and so I only plowed through about half of it before calling it quits.

The place is primarily takeout but there is a lunch counter and a pair of small tables in case you need a place to sit and enjoy. The service is super friendly as the owner is the one who takes the order and whips up the food. Definitely a place to check out, especially if you've never tried suya before."}
{"text":"Gotta be honest I haven't been back since they raised their prices yet again..  

We did like the food but it was already considered worst value in town yet something we would just splurge for anyways..  To imagine the prices even went up again from that point is really, honestly, incredible LOL..  amazing really

Anyways best of luck I guess business must be booming for them"}
{"text":"Whoa!!! This was amazing! Food take a little while to come and it's worth every minute! The meat is marinated and made right in front of you. Suya is the slightly spicy version that they have. The jambalaya rice... I've not had such delicious rice in ages! The combination of the two together is perfect. There are a ton of flavours if you need and even the spices can be adjusted. The second spice level was a sweet spice mix which I tried in a chicken wrap and I must say, it was again a treat. I've not been so satisfied with food outside in a very very long time. Def def try this place."}
{"text":"Great flavour, nice staff, but definitely not enough meat for the price we paid. I got the Steak & Chicken Suya bowl with rice. The container was like 90% rice and only a small layer of chicken with sauce on top half of the rice. The food was definitely delicious and flavourful, which is why I didn't give this a lower score. The sauce was amazing too.  But definitely for that price, there should be a lot more meat than that, especially given the place is a grill joint. My colleagues who came with me got wraps with the same issue, it was more wrap than meat. I can buy a large container of food with a lot more meat and veggies almost anywhere else for less than the price paid here."}
{"text":"Definitely  one of the hidden jems in brampton, if you are looking for a place with unique flavour and good fresh quality this is the place. The suya steak wrap was delicious and the naked meal was also a game changer."}
{"text":"Their naked butter chicken with jambalaya rice and butter chicken wrap, Amazing !!! Haven't tried anything  else but I'm sure their whole menu is 10/10."}
{"text":"Amazing jollof rice, wonderful service, and amazing food in general.  Cannot wait to be back in the neighborhood to order again."}
{"text":"Still a little pricey ($15) for a meal for one person. Pricey considering the portion given.. But I must say, the flavours has improved!! The jambalaya rice was amazing!! And they have earth friendly containers now. definitely an upgrade from styro. LOVED THE SUYA STEAK!"}
{"text":"The only complaint I ever had about this place is the amount of time you have to wait. That's it! But with everyone placing orders and with the food being so great what else am I to expect. There is minimum dining space, but I think they are remodeling. Last time I was there, it said they'd be closed for about 3 weeks. 

They modernize traditional Indian, Caribbean and African foods by making wraps, salads and sandwiched, with justifying the integrity of the traditional aspect. Whenever I'm in the Toronto area, I here grabbing a wrap or a meal. 

Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Everything  taste  fantastic.  Really fresh. Only  thing negative  is the price compared to the portion sizes."}
{"text":"Place is has very fresh food. Only drawback took a little long as they make the food fresh to order. Had the shambo half chicken dinner was alot of chicken! My friend got the seafood wrap he said it was incredible. Nice bbq spot. Next time I will call in advance. Would Def go again!"}
{"text":"So delish! Such a cozy, hearty place! Not tons of seating more takeout oriented.

Splendid taste, can choose from a variety of sauces, from mild to crazy spicy. Not for the faint of heart.

Wraps or rice dinner, you will be sated like no other wraps place."}
