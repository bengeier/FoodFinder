{"text":"I had heard an advertisement on the radio and have been looking for a job in an Italian restaurant, so I thought I would try this place.  It was very good. I went there for lunch with my sister and brother and we all enjoyed everything.  Laura was great too!!"}
{"text":"Simply the food is amazing you cannot go wrong with anything you order. We had that arancini Italian rice ball it was awesome. Chicken piccata was melt-in-your-mouth delicious fettuccine alfredo always creamy and good and the tiramisu was a perfect finish to the evening."}
{"text":"Excellent food and services. Laura was great. The leftovers are waiting for me. You will have leftovers for the portions are large. The eggplant siciliana appetizer was to die for. Thanks, Laura, for our most enjoyable lunch experience."}
{"text":"I'm new to Las Vegas and was looking for a good authentic, (off-strip, not chain) Italian restaurant...and I found it.  It's kind of out of the way, but completely worth it!  We went for lunch and the bruschetta appetizer was great.  The tomatoes were sweet even though they aren't in season.  I had the fettuccine primavera with olive oil and garlic.  The vegetables were cooked perfectly and the flavor was great.  One of my companions said the lasagna was the best he's ever had.  Another person in the party also went traditional with the fettuccine alfredo and said the sauce was creamy and cheesy without being too heavy.  We shared a tiramisu for desert which is homemade and perfect.  This small, obviously family-owned restaurant is a hidden gem.  It was casual enough to be comfortable, but still boasted cloth table clothes.  The service was really good also.  Hurray for supporting local small businesses and getting great food in the process."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, we passed this place and decided to try it, since hubby is a native Calabrese.  Things started off poorly with a waiter who was Mr. Sarcastic.  We weren't  starving so we ordered a Caesar salad and dinner to share.  The salad was decent enough.  But dinner...ziti with sausage, eggplant and peppers...was almost inedible. The sauce tasted like it had been cooking for a week, thick and bitter, with too much sauce to pasta balance.  The few slices of sausage were pan fried and overcooked prior to adding it to the dish. The eggplant was practically non-existent.  A couple of wimpy slices of green pepper. All this for a whopping $18.95!   Wow.  Sorry, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great food & atmosphere! First Italian restaurant I've been at where people eating there we actually speaking Italian. We will be back again."}
{"text":"The food here are great. The environment is nice and cozy. The server is very nice, friendly, and provided us the great service. Our boy loves the food here too especially the eggplant rollatini.  It did not take long to get our food too. We surely will be back again."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed when I made a special trip to this restaurant.  For months I have listened to the wonderful commercials on the radio.  Could not wait to try.  The few times I was going to be in the area was always a Sunday, when they are closed. That is why it took me so long to go there.    When I finally had the opportunity the food was just okay and the server was unwilling to recommend.  He actually asked me how he would know what item I would prefer.    I had expected a wonderfully cheerful, friendly experience, based on the commercial.  I believe the owner or manager was there and visiting with another table with the kind of experience I anticipated, we however did not even get a hello.    Luckily, I had a friend in from out of town.    Unfortunately, I was unimpressed."}
{"text":"Old school just like favorite joints in old Italian neighborhoods. The food and service are as good as you'll find including the expensive Italian restaurants on the Strip."}
{"text":"The staff is excellent but the food is just ok. First of all, no meatballs or sausage on the menu! Wow - really? An Italian restaurant with no meatballs or sausage - go figure.  I had the chicken parm and the sauce was good - the breading was not good - it was not crispy it was mushy. You get a tiny bit of pasta next to it and I was hungry 2 hours later. I am sorry but everyone kept saying how this was the best Italian joint in Vegas and it just can't be.  I went bec someone recommended it to a family member and there were 6 of us. The other 5 dishes were pasta dishes and ravioli which looked decent, How the hell do you not have meatballs???? Chicken Parm and dishes with cheese on them need to be under the broiler longer so they can crisp up a bit. This mush parm and chicken breading are not very good - ruins the whole dish.  The comment saying they just ate in Italy and now here and it was just as good? LOL seriously? Not buying that one bit,"}
{"text":"This place could have been on the East Coast.  Stick to the Sicilian Specialties and you will not be disappointed.  It is about 5 miles from the \"strip\" and the drive is well worth it.  Be sure to ask owner Pietro to share his social views with you, and trust waiter Louie's recommendations.   I was there with a party of 18 Italian Americans, mostly from New York, New Jersey & Pennsylvania, who thoroughly enjoyed the authentically prepared food.  Some may think the prices are a bit high, but you get what you pay for.  I strongly recommend the Mussels with white sauce as an appetizer and the Coippino for dinner."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great food atmosphere and service.  Large portions.  Excellent food.  Am a local and will continue dining here every time a get a hankering for sicilian."}
{"text":"Ate here for a birthday celebration. We were a group of 22 and had but one waiter. The waiter was Excellent!! He was on top of his game the whole night! Thank you to him! The food was also magnificent!!! I would highly recommend coming here! I know I'll eat here again!"}
{"text":"This is THE place to go for authentic Italian food. I have tried many of the items on the menu, and one of the best is the Chicken Angelo. The lemon wine sauce is perfect, the side of spicy pasta is amazing, the chicken is very tender. There are not many places around that serve Chicken Angelo, but out of those few, there is absolutely no one who does it as well as this place. You get what you pay for, and it's worth every penny. If you haven't been there, I sincerely recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"Definitely - As Good As It Gets - Including comparing their food to the many meals I ate in Italy two years ago. Actually, I think this is better. Treated myself and went there for lunch just yesterday - It was Valentine's Day. I was not disappointed.  At first, when I heard their ad on the radio, I was intrigued and kept thinking, \"I must try that place\", but it took a few tries as each time I went there they were closed - on vacation or something plus I found out they close for lunch on Mondays. Finally, I got lucky - went there and was so impressed that I've gone back a few times within 2 months. Highly recommended in all respects - decor, quality of food and wine, good diverse menu, great service and nice atmosphere.   Without a doubt, the best Sicilian/Italian food that I've found here in the valley - Las Vegas or Henderson - and I've tried many. I'm very particular about marinara sauce and because it's so hard to find a good one, I usually don't order it, but my friend decided to, so of course I had to have a taste. I was blown away - Surprisingly, very very good as is everything I've had so far. Yesterday I had mussels and Capellini (they switched from Linguini at my request) and OMG!!! Then there's the fresh baked bread and their house salad with raisins - The best dressing. Just writing this, I think I'll have to go back again soon. MMmmmmmm.....  The only suggestion I would make would be to have the choice of less expensive wine by the glass - I always enjoy a glass of wine with a good meal, whether it be with lunch or at dinner. If you're with friends ordering a bottle is no problem but when you're alone, lunch gets pricey @ $10.95 per glass, even if it is good wine.  But, at the end of the day, I cannot recommend this restaurant more highly and I will surely return often and on special occasions."}
{"text":"I have drove by this place a hundred times, after reading these reviews I finally decided to venture in. What a mistake. This place is the worst of everything, high prices small servings , horrible food and a mind numbing slow kitchen. 45 minutes to get our food and the place was empty two other tables going  Even after sending back a entree and a appetizer which where inedible, bill was still over 60.00, for two plates of paper thin chicken breasts. I could write more about this dump, but why waste the time."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been frequent patrons of The Sicilian for several years.  We recommend our visiting friends and business associates to dine at this fabulous restaurant.  We miss Mr. Gamino and are always happy to see Mrs. Gamino when she's in the restaurant.  The food is outstanding.  My favorite is the lobster ravioli with the vodka cream sauce.  My husband enjoys the lamb chops (and refuses to order anywhere but here).  We always take family members who are visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"I have been here on two occasions. The food was good both times. The service was problematic both times.   The first time, my date was carded, which is fine, but her ID was taken and inspected away from the table. The server, the manager and another server all stood in a huddle away across the restaurant within sight and openly laughed. No idea why. Very impolite and unprofessional.   The second time the server was arrogant and tried too hard to \"relax\" us. He was trying to control the atmosphere of the meal more than I like in service. When I attempted to order an appetizer with my wine on his first visit,  he chastised me and told me to slow down and relax. We hadn't eaten all day, not that he took the time to find that out. He was too busy telling us how to dine there.   Both times the food did not make up for the service. It is a little too pricey for the quality."}
{"text":"aka: Sicilian Cafe, read the reviews there too.  Being a New Yorker at heart I say to you that this is like a NY neighborhood Italian place. I swear it is like \"Mama\" cooking in the kitchen. Start with a fine Sicilian appetizer like Caponata Siciliana. The olives and peppers are mixed and seasoned just right. Move on to something like Angel Hair Pomodoro or maybe Lobster Ravioli with a choice of sauces. The menu of Italian Specialties is extensive. I've had most of them and find them all wonderful. I also like the salads that are cold and fresh. My favorite I must confess is the Siciliana which is fresh tomatoes, red onions, kalamata olives, oregano, and pure flavorful olive oil.  The Sicilian Ristorante is beautifully decorated. It is clean and well kept. The Wait Staff are all pleasant, knowledgeable, and quick. There is a wonderful wine list to choose from or get a suggestion that is always a great bet. I suggest a reservation for dinner. Be prepared to leave very full."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian food. The arancini or rice balls are like my monther used to make. The pasta options are plenty and many of them are original or hard to find combinations like pasta with eggplant. Delicious. As for the entree I am big fan of the fish dishes. The food is fresh and authentic. If you don't care about the decor the food will fill your senses with delighr. Food 45 Service 26 Decor 11  Total 82/100"}
{"text":"The best escargot in vegas. The food is great along with the friendly service. All of the Italian dishes we tried were very good and tasted like they came right out of new york, where we are from. It's our favorite Italian  resturant in vegas."}
{"text":"I used to drive by you every day and was curious...  Looked you up on Yelp and my stomach started growling.  I made reservations to surprise my date mate.  Turns out he had been there many times.  What a surprise!  My shrimp scampi was marvelous and my taste buds were smiling and singing!  I was too full to try their delicious looking desserts.  Next time for sure.  My date mate had one off their pizzas and it too was amazing.  And i can't forget kudos to our waiter Louie! What a cute knowledgeable pleasant cool man. He made me feel important and i can't say enough about him.  I'LL DEFINITELY BE BACK!  (and soon)"}
{"text":"I have been hearing the commercials on the radio and was intrigued. I had to try this place. My sister and brother in law joined me. The food was wonderful and the service was great! I highly recommend this quaint restaurant to anyone that enjoys a great Italian dinner!!"}
{"text":"If I could give more than five stars I would. This place has never disappointed! They have the most friendly servers and an incredible menu. We were even treated to magic tricks. You can't go wrong here, everything you choose is so delicious. It is a must-stop in Vegas."}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed the ambiance and food what a great experience!  I recommend this restaurant for Sicilian style food!"}
{"text":"Not too excited about this place. Didn't like the tomato sauce. Had chicken parmigiana with side of penne pasta large pieces of chicken and was tender. Served hot. Got spaghetti for two children 4 and 2. Was to be in small portion for each brought heaping mound on one plate STEAMING HOT. No small dishes for children. Had to use the bread plates for them.  Family seemed to like food so all good with that.  I asked for a single scoop of chocolate ice cream and was brought out a giant glass of it. $18 for something I didn't want and left 3/4 of it cause only wanted small portion. When asked about it said that's how served. Wasn't happy. Feel she should have told me and I would have declined. I probably should have had her take it back but ....  feel she could have given me the small cup I asked for.  I won't go back but think family might."}
{"text":"This place is to die for!!  Everything is made fresh in house...even the pasta!  While visiting a friend in Vegas we decided to have my first real Sicilian meal.  This is a cozy place with white table cloths, fabric napkins along with a great casual atmosphere.  The meal starts with a wonderful, beautifully browned, loaf of warm bread with butter. Then we both had a salad with the house dressing of creamy Italian . OMG, was it good!  They even bring out extra dressing because it's that good. For our main course we had the eggplant parmesan.  It looked too good to eat. It was loaded with cheese and the sauce was very flavorful.  This was served with a side order of spaghetti that was done to perfection, too.  Keep in mind that the main course servings are large enough for 2 meals.  For dessert I had the Terra me sue that was to die for.  Service was excellent and the price was too.  If you are in Vegas, give this place a try.  It's on Tropicana Ave but it's at least 5 miles from the strip so you cannot walk there."}
{"text":"Good food and a pleasant atmosphere. This is the second time I have been here and food is good, hearty fare and attentive service. I had the arancini and the fettuccine with clams in the white sauce and with generous portion sizes I was unable to finish, my guests had the steamed clams to share and the rigatoni and the shrimps in Garlic, more food than we could eat."}
{"text":"I've been here before and I can honestly say the food and service is happening !! When you have the urge for Italian food this is the place for the cure. I love how the ladies are treated I won't stop coming here glad I found this place."}
{"text":"Went here with my sister and her roommate for dinner.  The service was prompt and attentive.  Indeed, the waiter remembered my sister when she worked at another restaurant and comped us dessert which was sweet of him (pun intended).  The portions are large, so taking home half of your plate will get you another meal.  The food is tasty.  This is the kinda place that you go to for reasonable and good Italian food."}
{"text":"It's been over a year since we first dined and I'm happy to eat here anytime! Traditionally Amazing!"}
{"text":"Nice, bright setting. GREAT service. Great food.  Need to go again to see if it's a 5."}
{"text":"I went here a few months ago for a family birthday dinner, and we had an absolutely great experience. Our waiter, Howie, kept us laughing throughout the meal - we still talk about it! The food was delicious and the prices were reasonable. I could definitely see us going back again!"}
{"text":"i ordered linguini pescatore and eggplant parmigiana, i advice you to order it. itss sooo goood. i swear. the pizza was ok. but those 2 are the bomb.   #happyfoodhunting"}
{"text":"I can't believe I lived here for 10 years and never heard of this place until recently; both word of mouth and on the radio.  Just like an east coast restaurant, family owned and operated.  Why would anyone ever consider eating \"corporate\" Italian food.  At lunch, the dining room has table cloths and cloth napkins.   Been here twice for lunch and had the seafood pizza both times since I haven't seen it on a menu since back east.  First time I ordered it and ate it; I couldn't wait until I could go back and get it again. Today, 2 others in my party also ordered it.  Waitress and kitchen were able to accommodated special orders.  Have also had special order calamari dishes and shrimp risotto, yummy!  Plenty of bread and beverage refills.  Can't wait to go back again and see if I can get past the seafood pizza (maybe just share one as appetizer) and try some of the other food."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night. AMAZING! We ordered the fried calamari which was the best we have ever had.  My friend ordered the special chicken dish the waiter recommended and I ordered lobster ravioli with pesto sauce. The bread is homemade and dinner was incredible. Service was outstanding. Very attentive. I know a few other reviews said they had bad experiences but, it must have been a new waiter or something because our waiter was great. Clean, and friendly. The owners were there and came and talked to us about their hometown. We recently visited Italy and it was nice to reminisce about the trip. We will definately be back."}
{"text":"While searching for $ Italian restaurants, this restaurant's ad came up in Yelp (I guess ads work!) but I didn't realize until just now that this restaurant is listed on Yelp as $$. I assumed it was in the $ category that I was searching. But it might even belong in the $$$ category as entrées were mostly in the $20-$40 range.   Which leads to my biggest complaint about this place - it was much more expensive than I had expected.   The personal pizzas my wife and oldest son had underwhelmed - they found them a little dull.   The littlest one got a big bowl of spaghetti, which made him happy.  Two other sons were happy with their salmon, and lobster ravioli, respectively.   And I was very happy with my eggplant parmesan.  My wife & i both enjoyed our house merlot.  The service was quite good from start to finish. Our waiter was personable, responsive and attentive, as was his busgirl assistant.  I found the ambiance just right. There were many photos and murals on seemingly every wall, celebrating the beauty of both Italy and America. This restaurant definitely had much more character than one might find in a $-category strip mall eatery. This restaurant is free standing, and quite large inside, while still very cozy.  Plan to spend at least $25 per person."}
{"text":"This place is consistently excellent. The food is always top notch. The escargo is the best in Vegas. The chicken saltimbocca is best I have ever ate. The service is second to none. This place is a staple in my places to eat..."}
{"text":"Found this place just by driving by and so happy we did! Want some real Italian home cooking come here! You can't go wrong with anything you get but the lasagne is the best I've ever had anywhere. Alfredo and gnocchi's ? To die for the sauce was thick and creamy and cooked to perfection. The service was great always giving us refills without even asking. Everyone must try this place! You will not be sorry!!!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places.  The Lasagana is awesome!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine invited me to this place or else I wouldn't have known about it!  It's such a cute place, with pictures of the Sicilian coast and different US cities.  This review is for lunch only although I can't wait to come back for dinner.   They start you with fresh, warm homemade bread and butter. Our serve Laura was EXCELLENT! Her attention to detail and service was second to none. I am a lover of gnocchi and I try it wherever I go. I prefer very tender melt in your mouth gnocchi however this one was a bit firm. It was superb! I requested to substitute with Alfredo sauce instead of the red sauce. It was yummmy, served piping hot!   For dessert I couldn't pick between cannolis, Tiramisu or Creme brûlée. Guess what? It was my bday so I tried all 3!!!  Tiramisu was excellent! The cannoli and cream brûlée cream was a tad sweet for me, but they were both awesome! Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I come to this place about once a month, I can count on getting authentic Italian food, and most importantly authentic Italian hospitality. The chicken carciofi ( I think that's how you spell it) is the best Italian dish I have ever had, they also have many \"signature\" dishes you can only find there.  Howie (Wilfredo) is our usual sever and recognizes us when we come in, he is really a fun guy to have serve your food. The owner is there frequently and is a really great guy as well. I will be coming here until I leave Vegas, it's my favorite restaurant here for sure.  There house salad dressing is awesome, the fresh baked bread tastes as good as it sounds and the desert is great each time. If you want to dine Sicilian , there is only one way to do it in Las Vegas. Go to the Sicilian ristorante."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise! Husband kept hearing radio commercial while driving that he finally said  \"got to try this place\". And what do you know 'Pietro' (owner) was right, the food was real Sicilian, only better."}
{"text":"This place is bad, real bad..... you are better off making your own pasta at home!! save your money it is also VERY expensive.  they must have the pasta sitting in warm water because it was so overcooked and slimy , they dont even cook it fresh to order????? we all know that pasta cost pennies per serving. I just hate when expensive restaurants try to fool the public. i will never go back"}
{"text":"I asked the waiter how long they had been open. This Italian restaurant features classic decor, pictures of Sicily peppering the entire dining room. In short, the entire restaurant oozes that Godfather feel you'd want in any small Italian restaurant.  The escargot was EXCELLENT. The sauce was incredible, and the garlic was plentiful.   My chicken parmigiana was very tender, and they managed to not overdo the cheese, a common pitfall of many restaurants serving this dish.   The shrimp francesca sauce was delicious. The lobster ravioli had great flavor and texture.  And finally, the creme brulee. Excellent. No complaints here.  Service was up to par. The waiter staff was very attentive and friendly. Our own waiter was a little strange, but he was nice.  I definitely plan to come here again."}
{"text":"Ate there yesterday for lunch with my 14 year old daughter: for Lasagne ($12), extra sauce ($3), Garlic Bread ($6), Caprese Salad ($9). The server was very excellent. My daughter insists I mention that the Olive Garden would have been better. The Lasagne tasted like sauce out of a can that had set out for days with low grade hamburger mixed in. The very thin layer of cheese on top was so thin it was nearly flavorless and what flavor was there was not a good one. The bread that came with the meal was less than average. The salad was bland. The garlic bread was a celebration of overpowering garlic assaulting my mouth. The funky cheese on that garlic bread polluted the flavor. The impression we left with was that this restaurant's management and kitchen staff are care far more about making money and cares very little about what they send out of their kitchen."}
{"text":"Living near San Diego's Little Italy and caring for some spunky sicilian Nonas I got hip to the yummy fried gooey goodness of arancini! Moving to Henderson I cringed at the thought of being 5 hours away from it...However my silent worries were somehow heard and an angel surprised me with a serving one day at work...first observation: The sauce is on the plate with the arancini sitting on top? Not used to seeing it that way, so my taste buds were not expecting what was coming next...SWEET SERENITY! The arancini was fried well, nice crunch to welcome the cheesy rice in the center, scoop it up with the red meat sauce and peas (Perfection in every bite) Totally annihilates Cafe Zucchero's! I will definitely be checking into the restaurant in the coming weeks to check out the rest of the menu! 5 stars for a five star arancini. Will update when I get the whole dining experience! Mangia Bene!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably friendly staff who obviously love laughter and serving good food!  I had chicken fussilli and it was melt in the mouth good!  Wait staff were attentive to our needs (kept the bread and drink refills coming) and kept us laughing and loving the feel of being in Italy at this charming restaurant.  We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Most certainly recommended.   I was certain I was on the true path when Fragranza di Garlic enveloped me the instant I stepped inside the front doors. The overall aroma instantly flashed-me-back to my Aunt Maria's Queens apartment where, every Friday evening, after stopping at the vegetable market on the bus ride out of Manhattan, she would start simmering her sauce all weekend toward Sunday dinner for the entire famiglia.  The Sicilian certainly belongs well within the \"old-school Vegas white-tablecloth\" genre ... but it flies a bit more under the radar, as compared to other in the group such as Bootlegger, Casa di Amore, Ferraro's, Piero's, Golden Steer, et. al. Sicilian's generations of venues have certainly been around long enough to qualify. But it's more humble and reserved than those others.   Large & routine murals of Italy & New York (and even San Diego) drape the egg-white painted walls ... rather than a shower of vintage autographs or red velvet wallpaper or Vegas celebrity portraits upon red brick. Simple wooden chairs & tables rather than engulfing black leather banquettes. No Strip hotel limo service or mandatory valet, but there's plenty of free parking out front. (Except for casino property executives, I hope.) Local radio promotion much more so than glossy ads in the hotel room magazines.  At first, this all feels a bit empty -- hey youse guyz, give me my dose of vintage-Vegas-vibe! But actually it subtly serves to focus diners upon this venue's main concern: classic service delivered by fawning & talented staff ... followed by excellent mangia, mangia!  Ok, NOW I remember why I REALLY came in here!  The entire menu, as well as all the plates moving around the floor, looked scrumptious. But since I already knew I'd likely return, I eased on into it this go-round. House salad with the recommended Creamy Italian dressing started a bowl of Penne in Sausage & Peppers. With the requisite loaf of Italian bread, of course. It was all fresh & tasty, no surprise there, what with all the excellent reviews in place. I'm looking forward to future visits ... where I'll delve into their red sauce, dive into the al dente of their papperdelle and such. And there's veal chops on the table tents, though I didn't notice them on the menu. Being a red-meat sort of gentleman, I'm sure to eventually venture that avenue as well.  My server Louie didn't miss a beat. He's clearly been doing this - and doing it well - for many years. And his gift of gab proved it; he was well-honed at tailoring his table-talk toward his 'read' on the individual customer. And then the service. A free hand meant he slipped my next iced tea into my table - without missing a step moving toward another table to be plated from his other hand - and he slipped it as smoothly as a solid BJ dealer slips his own second card under his first. Not a drop of light ever struck the bottom of my bread basket or butter tray either ... and without request or gesture from me. As the last bite of my house salad disappeared from my plate, Louie was standing at-the-ready, to ask if I was ready. When I said I was, his right hand, with show, swooped my entrée in a single motion from an unseen cart behind my table and down onto where my salad plate used to be. Huh? Where did THAT plate go? A magician or a waiter, you decide. If proper service is what you consider as essential to 'an upscale & quality experience,' you certainly won't be disappointed here.   (Go figure Millennials who dead-drop three Bens for a $12 bottle of Svedka and their own seat in a nightclub ... then are anonymously sardine-crammed into thousands of other pulsating Millennial clubbers ... and yet somehow believe they've had 'an upscale & quality experience.' But, hey, it's their money, right?)  The ambient music brought the best of company to my table: Ol' Blue Eyes, Dino, The Velvet Fog, Ella, Nat King Cole, Bublé ... even Glenn Miller briefly table-touched (Begin the Beguine, 1943). I am unsure as to the source of this curation, however I was especially impressed that it paid proper respect to Dino's oft-overlooked classic-country coverage with 'Welcome to my World' (1967).  SUMMARY: Good Italian eats with fawning service, housed in humble but authentic & tasteful décor. As safe a bet as splitting your Aces. Grazie!"}

I am super picky when it comes to Italian food, since I am Italian.  Very few Italian restaurants impress me.    I was so impressed with this restaurant!  The food was very authentic!  The restaurant was very clean and attractive!   The staff was amazing!  Howard was our server!  He was so much fun!  He was playful and made us laugh, while being very attentive to our needs!  The food, while a bit pricey, was well worth the cost!  The owner came by our table as well, to see how our dinner was. Very classy!

{"text":"I was extremely excited to eat at this restaurant after hearing all the owners crazy commercials on the radio.   I was disappointed by the food and service and especially the owner.   The owner is the rude and disrespectful to the patrons of his business. We went in before the dinner rush around 4:00 pm. It was myself, my wife, my 8 yr old son, and my 1yr old. The owner decided to have a conversation as loud as can be about how he does not agree with interracial relationships and even more so doesn't agree with interracial children. I am of Mexican/American and my wife is Irish/american. My 8 yr old was completely upset because the owner went one to say,\" these kids are going to grow up thinking to themselves who am I? why don't I look like my mom or my dad?\" I was infuriated and my wife was fuming mad.   I don't care what you religious or political views are but you have a responsibility as a owner of an establishment to be respectful of your patrons who are spending money to support your business. I shouldn't have to explain to my 8 yr old why this old man is spewing hate and that we have to pay for it.   Once he finishes his rant we asked for the check and I had my wife put my kids in the car. I asked for the owner and we had a heated conversation. Which he offered no explanation or apology.   I will never in my lifetime eat or recommend anyone in town to this establishment and  I work in the hospitality industry and will do my best to not recommend this place to anyone.   My 8 yr old said it the best when were in the car \"We should have went to Olive Garden.\""}
{"text":"I love this place!!  My wife and I have been here a few times and we usually get the same thing because it is the perfect sauce!  We are always so excited to come here!! One of the servers is named Howie? I think! Sorry if I am wrong but he is amazing!!! The food is phenomenal and the environment is great but he makes it just perfect.  He is funny and personable with lots of jokes and always looking to get a smile and making everyone feel welcome.  My wife and I already brought our family in and will continue to bring more people.  We love supporting family owned businesses, especially when they well deserve it!!"}
{"text":"I' found this place a couple months ago. Me and my wife's favorite spot I like the Lobster Ravioli with pesto sauce."}
{"text":"The staff and food was amazing! I can't believe this jewel has been so close. You will not be disappointed by the food and friendly service at all. Everyone that works there is very attentive to everyone's tables. Highly recommend this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Order Postmates from this place my order came I paid 22 dollars for chicken Marsala with penne with house sauce. So my penne came with marinara sauce not house sauce and I paid extra for house sauce and my chicken Marsala was not in my order. I called and Gaegan answered told him the situation and said \"Sorry not my problem go deal with Postmates\" ...... are you serious??? How rude was that!!!!!! My first and last time that I will deal with this restaurant!!! Do not order from here!!!"}
{"text":"Classic Sicilian fare! I've been coming here since 1995.  Always an amazing meal and consistent meal."}
{"text":"Best food and service I have ever had! Hands down thr best authentic Italian food in Vegas. Excellent staff, sense of humor and just all around wonderful!"}
{"text":"I was going to give this a four star but I couldn't figure out a reason to not give it five. The staff is friendly food is hot!! If you're a fan of Alfredo goes for the pink sauce."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and we kept saying we should try this place. We finally did on our anniversary and were we glad we did!   We were greeted and seated very quickly and the atmosphere was great. The place was quiet, but had a few other tables eating that night.   Even with the other tables, we were attended to quickly and with great customer service.   Our server was Howard, a young and entertaining man. His humor was subtle and understated, but very well received.   The food was flavorful and the portions were very healthy. We would definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Great food great service..a nice comfort food meal off the strip. One of my favorites and a favorite with the locals...they make you feel at home"}
{"text":"I visit my Mother 4-5 times per year and we eat at The Sicilian each time. The food and ambiance are first rate at reasonable prices. While the location isnt as flashy as some overpriced Strip restaurant, the food beats any Italian I've had anywhere. The service is almost always friendly and prompt. Howard served us on August 10 was excellent. The Montepulciano house wine is marvelous. If you're traveling to LV and want great Italian, Take Tropicana east past Pecos - on the North side of the street."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's amazing. Food. Service. Ambiance. If you haven't been you need to go. Best Italian food. Try the chicken picatta."}
{"text":"This was EXACTLY what I was needing. My girlfriend and I met for dinner (for a night away from husbands, kids dogs, etc) and wanted somewhere quiet and quaint. So I saw the reviews on yelp and thought lets try it. I knocked it out of the ballpark!  From the owner to the wait staff we were treated with Kidd gloves!  We got there at 6 and closed the restaurant!  We first ordered the calamari and escargot. Wine and more wine. Then for dinner I ordered the chippano. oh my Gosh!!! It was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!  I had to bring most of it home because of eating the others but honestly, I wanted to share with my husband. There is no way to describe this dish, ya just got to get it!  For dessert we ordered the creme brûlée. Another wow!  Just a hint of lemon and the top crystallized perfectly. See,  what I mean about wow?  The restaurant was very clean and the bathroom was spotless (Always judge a kitchen by the way the bathroom is kept).  Now looking forward to going there with my husband soon!  I just ate the last of the Chippano."}
{"text":"Food was very good but the wine & cocktail list doesn't make any sense as it pertains to pricing.  I think you can bring your own wine which would be recommended based on their very strange price structure.  Would have rated a 4 if not for the bar pricing."}
{"text":"Our first time. After hearing the commercials we had to give this place a try. It had cloth napkins and tablecloths, cozy lighting, a love of Italy and America is their main decor. Nice staff, good with drink refills and time between courses. Great Cesar salad, delicious lasagna, perfect ravioli. And the bread... Oy, the bread. Whenever we're in town this will be high on the list."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here tonight with my husband and friends. We like to try new places and have driven by before so thought we would give it a try. Don't let the neighborhood fool you this is actually a good restaurant. The prices were higher than we expected for the area(average about $18-20 a plate) and not having ever heard of the place before our visit, but we stayed to give it a try. Our server Howard was quite the character which made our experience extra enjoyable. He was very funny and friendly. The dining area and bathroom were very clean. Our cups never went empty. I ordered the Rigatoni Amatriciana per the suggestion of Howard and the fact I couldn't make up my mind. Everybody in our party enjoyed their food with no complaints. We ordered tiramisu and a cannoli to share. Although the cannoli was good the tiramisu was much more enjoyable. I would say if your not into the super upscale must be fancy kind of restaurant but still want good Italian food, great service and an enjoyable experience then give this place a try. It's a family (family-friend) ran business which is great in my eyes."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with some friends and it was just as good as the first time.  Started with a shrimp, calamari, garlic bread and zucchini appetizer.  Their house sauce was really good to dip the sides in and garlic bread wasn't lacking garlic.  Their house bread was also good.  Crunchy on outside and really soft on inside.  Wife ordered chicken and mushrooms.  The mushrooms were just as good as beef.  I had a seafood and pasta dish that was outstanding.  Scallops, shrimp, clams, and others.  Took a bunch home.  Buddy had some lasagna that had great flavor.  I thought the texture was off until I realized there was sausage and ground beef in it.   One of the highlights of this place is the staff.  They are a bit of a smart ass and helpful.  Dessert was an espresso and creme brulee.  The brulee was a little sweet for me but the espresso help cut it.  Highly recommend this place.  Dress is casual but don't go looking like a bum."}
{"text":"This ristorante used to be really great BUT it has gone downhill since the last time we visited a couple months ago.  We paid $180 and the food was mediocre, Olive Garden style.  We could go to a high end ristorante for that price with really great service.   I won't be back.  The service was really strange too.  The place needs to have Jenn back and the owner doesn't care about customers."}
{"text":"just amazing.....the very best italian food that i have ever had in Las Vegas!  the rack of lamb is \"just amazing\".  the pizza is \"just amazing\".  Service is very much fun and family oriented. generally i aim low and shoot high.  they exceded every single expectation that i had.  very anxious to go back....and when you do go.....go very hungry!"}
{"text":"Wow! Didn't know customer service was around anymore til I walked into this place!  Never had an empty glass of water, checking on us many many times and food came very fast. The food was large portions and delicious really enjoyed this place will be back!!!"}
{"text":"My boss and I stumbled across this place the other day and decided to try it for lunch.  It was cold out and the bread was piping hot. It tasted great on a cold winter day.  I ordered the prosciutto and roasted pepper panini. When it came out, it didn't look like prosciutto. After I flagged the waiter down, he confirmed it was a sausage panini, apologized for the mix up, and said my sandwich would be out in 5 minutes.    The sandwich came with a side of pasta so I ate that in the meantime. The pasta we fine. I ordered it with the house sauce which the waiter explained was marinara cooked with meat and then strained to take out the meat while leaving the meaty flavor. Tasted like marinara to me.  My prosciutto panini arrived. It was okay but the prosciutto was a little chewy and it wasn't as good as I had hoped.  The service was only okay. The waiter didn't come over to refill our water for quite some time which I found annoying.  Overall, the meal was fine, but I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"My first time at this establishment and was very happy with the food and the menu. The desserts are fantastic The coffee is also wonderful. I definitely will come back and have Keagan as our waiter.    Happy Happy!"}
{"text":"I don't see how this place gets such glowing reviews.. I had the eggplant parmesan and it was just terrible. I ate a little of it and took the rest home and ended up throwing it away. Definitely frozen, probably microwaved, it was super watery. I also thought that the sauce was too salty and lacked any distinctive flavor. Maybe I'm spoiled because my mother in law is greek/Italian but STLL. I went in alone and my waiter blatantly ignored me, favoring tables with bigger groups. Maybe I didn't look so great as I had been moving boxes all day but STILL. I was there for 40 minutes before I even got my order in. However, the other staff was nice, and I basically had to work through them by flagging them down for water etc.. Wine and bread was good. Never again though."}
{"text":"Went in for a late lunch today around 3pm. The waitress was super nice and the restaurant was pretty empty for the most part. She was very attentive and the food came out quickly and was delicious. Wish I'd ordered the seafood because the nearby table ordered it and it looked and smelled great. I got the chicken Marsala and it tasted better than more Italian places I've been to. Spaghetti and meatballs was better than at Maggiano's at Fashion Show mall. I would come here again next time I'm in the mood for Italian food."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 10 stars!    You just can't find food like this in Las Vegas!  I've lived in Vegas for 12 years now and when I found this jewel, I just can't stop coming back!  The rice balls are out of this world!  Penne vodka, bolognese, fettucini carbonara...all the amazing dishes I miss from back home in NJ....  The only downside is that I know I've gained a few pounds since I started coming because I just can't resist those rice balls!  :)"}
{"text":"Hidden gem!  Do not be fooled by the outside appearance.  Delicious Italian wine and authentic mouth watering entrees.  The staff make you feel right at home.  We hope to come back on our next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"Caprese sandwich not what I expected the bun should have been toasted it was just lacking flavor."}
{"text":"I was recently driving in the area and saw the Sicilian cafe and being Born in Vegas and having tried every legitimate Italian restaurant in Las Vegas I couldn't remember  if I had actually ever eaten  there since I have tried so many places and many that are no longer in business.  I went there with 2 friends  for an early dinner at 6pm. (That is early for me as I usual eat at 8pm or 9pm. The dining room was dead with only 2 other tables occupied when we got there. It was early so  I didn't think much of it.  We were seated and the server Melissa came over and took our drink orders promptly and dropped off a bread basket. She was friendly. After looking over the menu we all knew what we wanted or were deciding between 2 differed entrees.  When Melissa came over for our orders, I asked  for her suggestion between the Tortellini  and Angel Hair. Although friendly, Melissa just said they are both good. My other friends had similar questions and received similar answers. Now I appreciate  when a server is honest and not always trying to up-sell just to pad the check, there was no help at all deciding between the dishes.   We started with Carprese, Minestrone and Pasta Fagioli.  All were  fine but nothing special or set them apart from anywhere or even pre made store bought variety. We all agreed that is was just OK.   Shortly after we received our dinners.  Tortellini, Manicotti Ripieni, and Baked Ziti. They were all hot and seemed  fresh baked by the look of them.  Hungery we all at most of our diners. The taste didn't back up the look of them. It was just OK.  Not bad not good or anything special. I was waiting for  somone to come out of the kitchen telling us, this dinner way prepared by Pizza Hut or Olive Garden.  It was good enough to eat  and fill you up but nothing I would come back for even if I was again in the area. The service and friendliness was the only think memorable about the dinner.   Since Sicilian Ristorante was very forgettable food wise, I am thinking that, combined with the countless Italian joints in Vegas I have been to, is exactly why I couldn't remember eating there before. The food is forgettable and uninspired and so is the restaurant.  If you love places like Olive Garden or Applebees you will like this place, if you want something more memorable and  not only get filled up and be on your way, find another Italian place. Forgettable!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the food was outstanding . The items on the menu are authentic Sicilian dishes . This restaurant is a must if you are in Vegas . We will be making this a destination point for an enjoyable dinner when visiting Las Vegas. The staff is friendly and can help you with any questions you have. Be sure to try the tiramisu ."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 5 for customer service, but as far as the food goes it gets a 3!   The staff were superb! Very friendly and the owner was great and funny!  The food was a bit overpriced, but it was delicious nonetheless! I thought what my boyfriend and I ordered was going to be huge by the way the server was explaining it (we shared), but I could our food my by myself.   It was a great first time experience!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite resturants in all of Vegas. This is the spot for Italian food! A great menu of classics and a very nice staff that knows their food. It's priced fantastic and very clean... a must order when you go is their homemade house salad dressing OMG it's the real deal Italian salad dressing that Mom makes, milky, cream, and rich; delicious."}
{"text":"Last night was our first time here.  Hubby and I have been looking for a nice Italian place to remind us of back home (queens,new york) and we tried many many places in the last 4 years and just couldn't find that special place , well tonight all of that was changed.  This place was wonderful, the food was great, warm Italian bread not cold like some of these other places , the appetizers were delicious, and done the way a Italian place is supposed to do it,  everything was on point.  I highly recommend this place we will def be regulars here.  Our server laura she was great too super nice and attentive. We can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and i were celebrating our anniversary (32 yrs).. we heard a great commercial on the radio. which caught our attention , they mentioned rack of lamb.The atmosphere was nice and we enjoyed the music Dean Martin Frank Sinatra etc...however if u like rack of lamb do not go... I had shrimp Francese...it was good..my husband ordered rack of lamb $59.00 we decided to splurge since it was our special day.. what he got was gamey tasting lamb chops.More like sheep only missing the fur...when we mentioned it to the waiter, he said he didn't want to complain to the cook/chef to avoid conflict...i dont know what is worse, a waiter without backbone or a chef  who's wait staff is afraid to talk to.I tried to explain to the waiter what rack of lamb looked like..this was not it... upon exiting the restaurant there happened to be a picture in the vestibule.. i promptly went back int the restaurant and asked him to look at the pictures,,,which he did.. the picture on the wall WAS\"\" Sicilian style lamb chops.\" the picture next to it WAS rack of lamb...he did not say much.. just wanted me to go away..We should have noticed the warning signs,,it was 7:30 pm on a Friday nite and there was only one other table with diners,, maybe they were busy earlier i thought...or maybe the restaurant is not very good...     I informed the waiter we will not come back ..$59.00 is a lot of money to spend and not get what u ordered.."}
{"text":"This used to be a wonderful place.  I started going to the Sicilian back in 1995 , when they were  in their other location .  It's been a while  since I dined here . The food quality has definitely changed and not for the better . The house sauce tasted different and was bland.  I had the manicotti . The decor which used to be elegant and upscale  is now a hodgepodge of 9/11 memorial wall.  Murals everywhere and American flags everyplace. They  want all cell phones off at dinner.  As another poster noted , inflexible rules . This place I'm sorry to say has changed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian restaurant in Las Vegas.  Great selection of great food. Limited but acceptable wine selection. A family run place on east Tropicana. Try it. Peter and his crew will treat you well and you will be happy!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Highly suggest it... However, only 4 stars because the young server was one of the weirdest dudes ever. Do your best to avoid eye contact and your food experience will be 5 stars instead of 4."}
{"text":"Excellent food, romantic atmosphere, great service (ask for Louie)."}
{"text":"Best Italian food we have had in a very long time living in this city! Authentic and sauce was absolutely amazing! We have been in Vegas for over 20 years now, very sad we had to wait ( five years short of a quarter of a century)  to discover this absolute gem of a place. The service was outstanding (and entertaining) and the food was AMAZNG! No words really to describe how good it actually was. My only gripe is that we are really upset they are going on their annual vacation tomorrow (for two weeks) because after the dinner we had last night we are craving them again.  I know everyone needs a vacation but OMG we just found you (and fell in love)!  Not fair! P.S. on a side note their arancini (rice balls) are the best that we have ever had. FINALLY a restaurant who knows how to make them Sicilian style,  with the perfect balance of meat and peas. Highly recommend this place (even if it jeopardizes our accessibility to future reservations)  and we can't wait to go back. It was that good!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, great service and everything an Italian restaurant  Of this calibre should be. The servers were comical . Attentive and the food was piping hot ,,,,,,,. Keep up the great work guys,,,,,"}
{"text":"We took a chance & what a great choice. A gem in the desert. Great meat sauce & wonderful lasagna. Fun staff."}
{"text":"Our first visit was last night.  Why haven't we been here before?  What a welcoming restaurant.  We were greeted immediately and taken to our table, that was big enough for us not to feel like we were on top of each other.  The service was impeccable.  Food was incredible.  I am vegetarian and had no problem being entirely satisfied.  My husband and our friends had non-vegetarian food and raved about it.  Wine list is wonderful.  The owner went to each table more than once to check on his guests.  We felt we were guests in his home.  We never felt rushed to turn the table.  We simply had a wonderful time.  It appeared everyone else in the restaurant did too.  We highly recommend this wonderful place.  Bon Appetito!"}
{"text":"I was invited by a friend, so i didn't pick the place.  I loved it.  I have a friend that is Italian and her mom used to cook for her birthday, it reminded me exactly of that.  We had calamari, brochettes with plenty of garlic flavor, and I had a seafood soup I don't know the name all I know that it was good, i ordered by the picture on the wall."}
{"text":"Although I lived across from Sicilian Ristorante and drove by it all the time, I did not visit until last night. It unfortunately suffers from existing a few blocks down from the famous Casa di Amore, which is my go-to Italian restaurant. My mom, boyfriend and I came in on a Wednesday night and it was empty save for one couple. The staff was very friendly though and even made a few jokes about it being dead that night. We ordered two martinis and a Peroni (they don't have any draft beer). The martinis came in their own shakers and were served at the table. We were also served fresh, hot, home made bread which was great. We ordered the chicken parmesan, gnocchi with meat sauce, and pappardelle romano, which our server stated was one of his favorites. The pappardelle was indeed the crowd favorite. It was a huge portion of pasta served in a pink sauce with ricotta cheese dollops throughout. This is a ton of food and I'll probably be eating it for a few days. The gnocchi was alright, our server referred to it as \"bullets\" and \"poor man's pasta\" because it's so filling and sits in your stomach like a bullet I assume. He was correct. I've never had gnocchi in a meat sauce before but it was good flavor wise. A cream sauce would have definitely been too heavy. Even eating 2-3 of these made me full. I didn't get to try the chicken parmesan but it looked like what you'd expect. I was really wanting to try the cioppino or linguini pescatore but passed this time. All of their specials sounded really good but also really expensive. We finished the meal with pistachio gelato which was a milkshake glass filled with gelato and pieces of pistachio inside. I'd come back just for the gelato. Overall this is a very viable option for Italian food in the area. I'm sure that if it was busier inside we would have had a different impression upon entering but you have to wonder why it's so slow. They did say they've been in the area since the 90s though so they must be doing something right. It's hard to compete with Casa di Amore but this is a good option for a little slower, quieter, less crowded dining experience."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian spot in Vegas! In a picky eater and this by far is the best Italian restaurant in Vegas. Born and raised in Vegas I've tried so many Italian restaurants. I almost gave up on Italian until I found this place. I always order the chicken piccata.... Delish!!! The Ceasar salad is amazing and big enough for 2-3 people. The service is wonderful!! You have to check this place out....you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Incredibly authentic Italian food and super hospitable service! The food was very fresh and Howard our server was absolutely charming. Highly recommend this wonderful restaurant! We ordered the lobster ravioli with pesto, a chicken dish and rigatoni with eggplant."}
{"text":"I am from the Philadelphia area and my Aunt & Sister kept raving about this place. Now I see why! Wonderful wine menu, wonderful selections, and wonderful staff. Thanks for enhancing our dining experience! A special shout out to Laura our server and the lovely hostess ( daughter in law) for making our visit so special!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I come here at least once a week. Amazing Italian food. The escargot is to die for. Family owned. Everyone is so friendly. Must try"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch because I was referred by a friend. I thought it was okay but I wish they had more on the menu. The service wasn't as good as I thought it  was going to be because there weren't that many people in there so I thought the service would be super quick. It took a little longer than expected but the food was pretty good a little expensive though. I had the pasta marinara and my friend had the chicken parm! Pretty decent amount of food but no lunch specials. Nice clean environment."}
{"text":"It's safe to say this has become our favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. The food is incredible. We just returned from some time in Italy and this is comparable to the old lady window made pasta of Rome.   On top of the food being fantastic, Howard, our server is funny, attentive, and knowledgeable. We keep coming back.   Thank you for the wonderful ambiance, service, and food."}
{"text":"We had a very nice lunch.  My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs and I had a chicken and pasta dish with some fresh vegetables and capers.  Generous lunch portions and attentive service."}
{"text":"On the advice of a friend who is local to Las Vegas, we visited the restaurant on 4/8/15, and it was the best meal we had our entire trip.  The food was phenomenal,  but even better, was the staff. Luis, our server was nothing short of the best, a fantastic personality,  knowledge of the menu,  and not to mention his resemblance to al pacino! J.P. who also waited on us and even the nice young guy who filled our water glasses were also incredible. Our party of six had bruschetta, minestrone, salads, fried mozzarella,  carbonara pasta, stuffed shells, chicken parm, stuffed eggplant, and spaghetti with sausage. No one had a complaint about any of it. The portions were large, all was cooked perfectly and we left satisfied and without breaking the bank.  We will definitely be visiting again and recommending to all of our friends."}
{"text":"I'm Italian and don't eat out Italian food often. Came here with my friends and was not disappointed. The food and service was amazing! Reminded me of back home (New York) at my aunt's house. The owner (I believe) sat us and spoke with us for a bit. I felt like I was talking to family. Ordered caprese , shrimp scampi, rigatoni, stuffed shells and pizza. Everything was amazing! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here on 10/4. I used to go to the old Sicilian Cafe back in the early 90's and the food was always great. The decor on this location is kind of dated. It is an old Vegas restaurant but could use an update.  However it was clean and comfortable for dinner, and they were very gracious about giving us a more quiet booth after they already led us to another table.  On to the food, the menu is expansive, with pretty much all of the Italian specialties you'd want. The bread was delicious and is made in house. We started with a mozzarella caprese. Very nicely presented, the mozzarella was soft and fresh. The fried calamari was delicious, fried to perfection, and very tender. We then ordered baked clams oregenata. We did not care for these, as the clams they used are large and tend to be chewy. They were fresh, but it was a preference thing. For Entrees my wife had Chicken Angelo which was very tasty and tender. I had spaghetti carbonara, which had great flavor, but was a little on the dry side. The portions are generous, and the staff very attentive. Overall we were very pleased and will eat there again."}
{"text":"I checked this place out kinda late on a weeknight. I was the only one there and I think it was close to closing time, but I never felt in any way rushed. I appreciate that! Great service, cool atmosphere, classic Italian restaurant and very Vegas in the decor. The Spaghetti Carbonara was excellent! And so was the salad. The prices seem reasonable to me, especially for food of this quality. Impressive wine list, but I always just go for Chianti with Italian food. This is definitely a place I will return to."}
{"text":"Looking for a great Italian diner, we came to this restaurant recommended by some family members.  Our waiter was very attentive and polite.  The ambiance is nice.  The foo Food wise: eggplant parmigiana was good and well presented. Pasta Alfredo was bland and the chicken in it was not as tasty. The house salad was pretty small but it tasted good. I asked for a chicken dish with I choice of veggies or marinada pastas, I went with the pasta which did not impress me.  The entree prices are around $15-$20 dollars for common entrees.  If you go more specialty like a lamb rack is about $59  The tiramisu was pretty good but I thought it was pricey at $8."}
{"text":"We gave it a try and found it to be good up to a point. We came in with \"No Reservations\" (ha ha) and got seated without a problem. The place was mildly busy and the decor is better on the inside than the outside. Started out with some Calimari and it was top notch! The complimentary bread was hot and tasty. We were starting to get full and satisfied already. The house salad was chilled and delicious! They even gave us a slightly smaller portion because we got filled up a little on the appetizers. Our pasta dishes were just OK, I had the Penne Putanesca and it was kind of salty and nothing special. My wife's chicken and pasta was not that good either and the sauces tasted the same on her plate as well as mine. The chicken breast was paper thin and not anything special. I had a beer and wife had a glass of wine, then we took a few cannolis to go. Great dinner for the most part, just the entrees were weak. \"Friendly\" Sicillian owner seemed to specialze with a few of the guests and never did say hello to us. Then a woman brought out a little baby and visited some customers, but not us. No big deal I guess. We finished our dinner and headed out the door, not even a \"goodnight' or \"thank you\" from the employees and family at the counter. Meh, whatever.  We liked the food and will come back again someday. I'll stay with what I like, pasta with meatballs and will have to try out their pizza. Sicilian thick crust pizza is what true pizza should be. I hope they have what I want the next time we are in."}
{"text":"We went here because I had , yes, you guessed it, a coupon.  I cannot think how many countless times I must have driven past this place and never noticed it was there. Admittedly, I was usually late for work and too busy cursing the vehicles observing the speed limit to take in the scenery, but I actually thought it was fairly new. I asked the waiter, who informed me they had been there 26 years. Wha-wha-what?  It's in a fairly seedy little strip mall, but is surprisingly spacious and pleasant inside. The decor is a schizophrenic blend of travel posters from Italy and all the little American flags that eventually blew off car antennas in the wake of  post 9/11 patriotism. Glad someone picked them up and put them to use. I'm all about recycling.  Anyway, since we were saving $25, I decided to splurge and get the veal, which I thought at $30 was a little spendy for a neighborhood joint, but it was two nice sized pieces of good veal, not the dark squishy kind, so it was not overpriced. And I tried to get the Anaconda to order the manicotti, since I must have something cheesy and red saucy when in an Italian restaurant. He rebelled at the last minute and switched to the canneloni (curse that waiter for letting him know there was no meat in manicotti just because he asked), but the bite I got was pretty tasty. We alo had a stuffed mushroom appetizer, which was just ok (served in marinara and no meat in the stuffing), and broke down and ordered the a la carte salad, which was good but $7 extra. (A pet peeve of mine).   I was teetering between 3 and 4 stars when they trotted out the cannoli. Oh, my. The shell was nice and crunchy and it was overflowing from both ends with the most rich, delicious, creamy filling. Yum! It was the best one I've had since that little Italian bakery at the Reading Terminal in Philadelphia. I was feeling propelled towards a 5 star sugar rush, but another reviewer was right: ditch that pic of Sarah Palin. What a buzzkill on the way out!"}
{"text":"Recently, I went to this restaurant for takeout, I really wanted pasta and meatballs.  The dinner for one was over thirty dollars.  When I got it home, I  noticed the sauce didn't even stick to the pasta.  A good sauce sticks!  Then the meatballs were hard as rocks.  The meatball bounced on the plate.  I've never been so disappointed.  Bland, cardboard meatballs!  I will never return to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I stumbled in this restaurant on my last night in Vegas after a very long day at Hoover Dam. I was in the mood for Italian and really thirsty.   I was seated quickly and the server took my request for water and to \"keep 'em coming\" seriously - the water was never empty again. I took a bit to decide what to order because it all sounded great. I decided on the Lasagna with house salad. The food was outstanding! The house sauce was a rich, tangy red sauce - it was magnificent! I wish I could say more but it wouldn't do it justice.  The real gem of this place is the owner and staff. The owner circled the restaurant and greeted each table and asked about everyone's meal. The servers on staff that night - JP & Howard - were friendly & funny.   Then it got really fun...the owner circled back to my table again and chatted with me for probably an hour. Had the nicest conversation with him and found out he is a Minnesota native and he shared a little about his family. You can tell that everyone who is working in the restaurant is family or practically family. There is a relaxed vibe to the restaurant and everyone there that makes for an enjoyable evening.  We will absolutely return when we visit Vegas again and highly recommend The Sicilian Ristorante."}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant from the moment we walked in. The staff was so friendly and their mission was to please their customers, a dying art in many places. The menu is extensive from seafood, to pastas, to veal...too numerous to mention. We started out with pasta fagioli soup and fried mozzarella ball for our appetizer. Very tasty. Next the entrees, calamari marinara, done perfectly, nice and tender, my companion ordered the veal Francesca which was amazing, melt in your mouth dee-lish.  Even though we were full  we went on to the desserts and found the creme brulee was delicious. The owner came to the table with a cannolli  made at the restaurant with a nicely textured creamy filling that was very good. The bread, the house wine, the family atmosphere made for a great night out for we Sicilians who are always looking for authentic food like we had back east.  The area the restaurant is located is a strip mall not very pleasing to the eye, but once you enter the restaurant and find the warm friendly atmosphere, the fantastic service, and wonderful food, you realize this is one of those diamonds in the rough. We will definitely dine here whenever we are in Las Vegas.."}
{"text":"The food and service was delicious!! The waiters are awesome. Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"I usually read reviews on new places I'm about to explore. But this time around I left it to my boyfriend he had been craving chicken alfredo for a good while now and he found this place so why not. Upon entering I noticed it was a nice quiet place i loved all there decoration too. we got seated right away had our order taken fast. and our food served nice and hot. I ordered the shrimp scampi and my can I say I loved it. You have the choice of either pasta or vegetables. I ordered the vegetables and everything tasted just right I loved how it wasn't overpowered with lemon flavor because after a while it gets too tiring and sour. This plate I was able to enjoy till it was empty. Besides food being delicious our waiter was extremely entertaining everytime he would come check on us he would make a joke. Bonus for making us laugh. They have a private room too for special events. Overall I will be coming back to this place evrything about it I enjoyed. I recommend"}
{"text":"First - I am a tough critic.  So I don't give four stars very easily.  I have eaten here about a dozen times - this year!  I have not been disappointed once.  Today was Chicken Piccata with Minestrone soup.  The food is the freshest in town and you do not walk out of this place feeling weighed down.  The service is excellent.  Take down that picture of Sara Palin in the front lobby and I give it 5 stars (just kidding - sort of).  Love the place - will return soon"}
{"text":"This place was above 5 stars before... This place used to make me feel like I was eating authentic Sicilian food in NY.  Ever since the original owner passed away, this place went down the drain. My personal opinion. When the original owner (the Sicilian guy, super nice) was there, he always greeted everybody that was eating in his restaurant, made sure if everybody was 100% satisfied and made us laugh. I loved his service and he always went out of his way to give us better services. Now that, some family member (son in law?) took over and this place became like regular ordinary Italian place. We were so excited to have seafood salad, baked clams, linguine with white clam sauce and arancini on Christmas Eve day. This new owner changes the menu for every occasion (Christmas eve, Valentine and so and so) to regular Italian restaurants' menu, because it's easy for them to prepare. We ended up eating Cioppino or shrimp scampi or something. I forgot  because it wasn't memorable. Do you know how important for old fashioned NY Italian (Sicilian) to eat seafood salad on Christmas Eve!!?? It's a must!! It's a tradition!! If you ask any Sicilian person that's living in Brooklyn what they eat on Christmas eve, they would say insalata di mar!!! Since this was the only place I was able to grab real Sicilian style Christmas dinner, I am very disappointed.  Nothing special here anymore. Ciao."}
{"text":"Having dinner again here with my wife for her birthday. It only gets better every time we eat here."}
{"text":"Really good food had the chicken marsola my mom had the chicken parm dad had the noodles with clam sauce and my brother had the ziti  it was the so good"}
{"text":"Recently had dinner here because my Mother heard a radio commercial so figured why not.  Pleasantly surprised and would not have heard of this place if not for the commercial.  Calamari to start, nice and crispy.  I had the Canneloni Ripiene and sampled her Veal Piccata.  All excellent and good portions.  I agree with the other poster that the salad dressing is delish.  Overall, the service is great.  One of the friendliest staffs I've encountered.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Went for pick up as I entered the order online. When I got there (first time there) noticed that the front door (looked old as if the place was closed or out of business) had electrical tape all over the handle and the seats in the foyer had cracks in them. Not the greatest first impression. Anyway, walked in and said I'm here to get my pick up. Instead of listening the waiter told me to follow him to a table where he placed menus on it. I never left the front counter. He came back and said to follow him. Again I said I'm here for my pick up. He looked confused and finally realized I was not eating there. All this time I realized that this place was so dark inside. Interesting, they didn't have any windows. I guess if they did you would see the used cars for sale in their parking lot. Oh, the food, passable at best. Sadly it didn't have any flavor and was VERY bland. Really over cooked. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Yum! Large portions and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite Italian style restaurant in Las Vegas. I am Italian I grew up on the east coast. Everything is great the food, atmosphere and service! The owners are always there and they try to really get to know you. They are very sweet, even when I bring the kids. My kids love the pizza. I love the chicken parmesan the sauce is so delicious. The homemade Italian dressing for the salad is yummy too. Homemade bread is great and always hot. My husbands favorite is the shrimp ala diabla. Its shrimp in marinara sauce with pasta of your choice ,we like linguine, and its spicy mmmmm!!! The creme brle is amazing! I have been going here for the past 5 years and LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"Finally had an opportunity to try this place.  Very impressed!  The service was outstanding!  We roll a little heavy and tonight it was me, wife, my 4 yr old daughter, my 2 mo old son, and my aunt and uncle.  JP took care of us and all of our high maintenanceness.  We knew this place was going to be great when it got the blessing of my Uncle Vitto (who said they make the best Eggplant Parm in Vegas not made by him personally).  The food was outstanding!  If you're on the easy side and want great Sicilian food, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Italian food has never been one of my favorite cuisines.  Blame it on Olive Garden and run of the mill Itallian food if you will, its just never stood out.    To my surprise Sicilian Ristorante has done the unthinkable, made me really really really enjoy Italian food!  Everything I had was extremely simple but perfectly executed which had me craving more.  I started with the Siciliana salad, super simple and super flavorful.  There must have been 2 whole tomatoes in the salad, and I'm not talking about cherry tomatoes.  The Salad itself could have been a meal.  It was delicious and you have to get the anchovies!  The Bruschetta was your standard bruschetta, nothing that really set it apart but it was very well done.  The bread was perfectly toasted and there was the right amount of tomatoes, garlic, and basil in every bite.  Chicken Carciofi was devine.  So light and packed with flavor!  The chicken was cooked perfectly.  They didn't go easy on the artichoke hearts either.  I couldn't get enough of the sauce.  Absolutely delicious!  Its definitely not as cheap as olive garden but it's well worth it.  Simplicity pays off at Sicilian Ristorsnte and the portions are great.  I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This what I think of when I think of Italian food, especially Old VEGAS Italian. They have been here for decades. The service is incredible. The staff is friendly and many have been here since the beginning, so that says a lot about the loyalty of the owners.  The escargot is the best in Vegas. No stupid mushroom caps taking up filler, when they bring out the plate it is escargot with escargot caps."}
{"text":"This restaurant is close to me and family owned which are two things I enjoy. For my appetizer I ordered the stuffed mushrooms, they were just ok. I did not think the stuffing was anything special. For my entree I order the lasagna as I always do. And as always, it was delicious . Service is hit or miss, some times they are very slow but when that happens they are still friendly."}
{"text":"Step inside little Italy when you enter this restaurant. Greeted by true Italians when you enter the place. This place is family owned and it shows.  The ambiance here is great. Booth seating or table. Pick your choice. They have lovely pictures up of Italy and a few of America. They have a big sign in the back that gives a buck thank you for letting the owners have the \"American Dream\" and being able to thrive here in the states.  The servers here are a great source of entertainment. Constantly cracking jokes and keeping you laughing throughout the meal. This was great! We started off with a Caesar and mozzarella caprese. Great start to the meal. The Caesar was huge. Split between two and we didn't even finish it. Caprese was done just right but the tomatoes could have been a little more ripe. Main courses included pappardelle pasta dish and chicken francese. Both were amazing!! Very authentic Italian. Fresh hand-made pasta. The Papparedelle had the most amazing meat and cream sauce with fresh ricotta on top. The chicken melted in your mouth! It came with a nice side of fresh pasta with a nice tomato sauce. The cannoli was for dessert. I have never had a cannoli that tasted so good! The filing was the most amazing custard flavor.  I love this place and I hope to come back again the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"The food here was great! We are from Long Island and looking for some great Italian food and this was it!  Howard was our waiter, he was hilarious and very helpful.  The rice balls for an appetizer were absolutely delicious! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We couldn't have had a more pleasant dining experience!!  My kid sister, visiting from MI, & I, visiting from AZ, were greeted at the door like family!  When our server heard we were from his home state, it was like meeting an old friend.  Our house salads & minestrone soup came with a loaf of fresh-from-the-oven, homemade whole wheat bread.  We enjoyed the PENNE a la SICILIANA and SPAGHETTI (I substituted Fettucini) a la CARBONARA--couldn't have been better.  And then we shared a bowl (yes, martini-glass style bowl) of Tiramasu that was scrumptious!  Each course was served from a quaint wooden cart--nice touch.    The only thing potentially off-putting were the warnings posted here & there--turn off your cell phone (they seem to be allowed at lunchtime to accommodate working lunches); \"If you decide to alter our menu, it becomes your responsibility. Either you like it or not, you will be CHARGED FOR IT!!!!!!!,\" etc.  And the overall '80s decor could use updating when the economy improves.  But save the murals!!  In summary; the FOOD was top-notch, the SERVICE was impeccable, the ATMOSPHERE was divine!  I will make sure to visit every time I go to Las Vegas and tell my friends for their next visits!!"}
{"text":"Drive by this place everyday on my way to work and now my kids go to school right next door, so we figured it's time to give the Sicilian a try. Glad we did! Ambiance is that of an old school family Italian restaurant: huge pictures of Italy on the walls, white tablecloths, but with a takeout counter up front. Service was great - super friendly, quick, and very welcoming to our kids. When we first came in, he said, \"ok I'll bring out some bread and a side of pasta for these two. And don't worry about the linens-we don't do the laundry!\" When the bread and butter came out, he told us we got \"VIP butter\" because it was all soft from the heat lamp.  Portions were big. My husband always orders escargot when it's available, so we checked out the Sicilians. They were big and meaty, with 3 escargot in every little spot! Our glasses of wine were doubles, too! As for taste, it's good. I enjoyed the escargot and the manicotti with meat dish, but they weren't off the charts.  When you see the menu, prices seem a little high ($12-18 for pasta, $10-15 for glass of wine), but portions are big enough to split, making it a pretty good value. Great restaurant for the whole family. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I recently purchased a home nearby. Being full blooded Sicilian and in need of a pasta fix I quickly put it to the test.   The eggplant parm and pasta was perfect. Old school and authentic. First of all - no breadcrumbs. Beyond that it was perfectly cooked to melt in your mouth and had the perfect amount of the right cheese. The portions are huge. The eggplant portion outsized the pasta. I could not resist finishing it and busted my belly. Fresh hot bread was served first.   A few days later I took my son. I could not resist the eggplant parm despite many other old school plates. My son opted for the salmon which was excellent.   Sorry no pictures this time. When the food came we tore into it. It's about 8 minutes from McCarron Airport. Near the MGM, the Tropicana, New York New York, Hooters, Excalibur etc.   Go."}
{"text":"Imagine a Dick's Last Resort that served great Italian food and the servers were funny instead of assholes.  Congratulations, you've found Sicilian Ristorante!   I had no idea what to expect when I came in here. The place is located in the strip mall behind the plasma donation place. It's not exactly bustling down there. It's a diamond in the rough.  Our server was fantastic. He had this Mitch Hedberg like demeanor. Said things kind of flatly and stood awkwardly, but was hilarious and did his job better than some servers who also don't have to play characters.   After we gave him our order, the first thing he said before he walked away was, \"Great, I'll get the microwaves started.\" It's hard to pin down but it was so hilarious. The fact that he broke the facade of the kitchen but did it in character was hilarious.   And it was amazing lasagna. I've had bad, obviously reheated and previously frozen lasagna in a restaurant before. This was not that. The lasagna held together amazingly. The meat was flavorful and plentiful. It was saucy without being overpowering. It was delicious.   We were the last ones out of the restaurant but even then the servers didn't rush us out. Another server who was cleaning tables started talking to us and he was awesome too. What that server said felt authentic. That's the best part. You could almost say that when you're here, you're family.  But you really can't say that because some other Italian restaurant has a claim on that. Just come to this Italian Restaurant instead, it's amazing."}
{"text":"Came in on a weekday and was seated asap BC it wasn't that busy. The interior is nicely decorated and my waiter suggested the Linguine Pescatore since I was craving seafood.  My entree included salad which was fresh and chilled. When my Linguine  Pescatore arrived I was shocked at the size and all the scallops, shrimps, clams, mussels and calamari the entree included. The red sauce was not overpowering and I could really taste the melody of seafood ingredients.  My waiters was friendly and knowable with his menu offerings. Only negative was I was I was full and couldn't order any dessert!"}
{"text":"On the first visit, the staff was friendly, the place was packed, and my wife tells me the lasagna was well worth the $19, which only took 15 minutes"}
{"text":"Loved it!  We had a fantastic late  lunch of a magnificent Sicillian Pizza pie.  wait time was average and service was good but there were only a couple other people in the restaurant at the time."}
{"text":"Ordered their cheese pizza with anchovies. What I recieved was a replica of a Totinos pizza. It was virtually devoid of both sauce and cheese. The anchovies were served on the side - raw. I have been eating anchovy pizzas for 53 years (I am 69 now) and can say with conviction that The Sicilian Ristorante served me the worst anchovy pizza in those 53 years. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"i drive by this place all the time,went there for lunch today,waitress was so nice,wasn't crowded,was told everything was homemade,had baked clams and she said they take 15 minutes,they were done from scratch,then i meet the owner,makes me feel i'm at his home,i'll just say that's what a real italian restaurant should be.also the bread is very good,also made in house,the prices are not at all high,i laugh when i see what people pay on the strip,very nice restaurant and nice staff"}
{"text":"They have the best Italian food in Vegas. The service either for lunch or dinner is fantastic.  Fresh food,  friendly professional service at a reasonable price.  The décor is outdated but the food is modern and delicious."}
{"text":"I have driven by here a million times and never really thought to stop in. But a friend asked to meet us here because he had always heard this place being advertised on the radio. Sure, why not?  The strip mall location is a little strange. Even though this is pretty much my neighborhood, I don't think I had ever frequented any of the other businesses here.   But this place had the charm. Our server was hilarious. Totally catered to our groups brand of comedy. Teased me about the salad I ordered and wrote our order down on the linen tablecloth. When you expect a run of the mill Italian and you instead get a place that makes you feel like your brothers are joking around with you AND the food is good? Such a keeper of a place."}
{"text":"This was a great accidental find. More on your plate than you can possibly eat, and about as authentic as I've found. The waitress was super nice and made  you feel like you were the most important customer of the week. The minestrone soup wasn't my favorite (too much broccoli) , but it's certainly made from scratch and authentic. The pizza was the best I've tasted anywhere. I doubt I will find anything as good again. Just wish I lived closer, I'd be there every week."}
{"text":"I always rate restaurants in  three areas. 1.Service 2. Food 3. Cleanliness  As a family of 2 that eats all of our meals at restaurants. I can say that this restaurant constantly gets FIVE STARS."}
{"text":"Authentic Sicilian restaurant in suburban Las Vegas.  As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a super friendly staff. We were seated immediately in a romantic booth. Our waiter, Louie, was super nice and funny. He recommended some great wines to start.  We started with the fried mozzarella which was great. For my meal I had the eggplant parmigiana. It was delicious. I sampled my boyfriend's penne and sausage. The sausage was made in house and was out of this world.  Great food and great service. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great authentic Italian cuisine and atmosphere.   Friendly staff.   Had shrimp parmigiana and chicken parmigiana   Both were delicious and generous portions served with pasta.   Delicious hot bread was also served.  Howard AKA Vincenzo was funny and friendly.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Fun place, Great Italian atmosphere, Felt like your in Italy. Good food, waiters entertaining with jokes and great service, Every dish from Fresh Bread, appetizers, main course, deserts, was real good and tasty fresh. And oh the cheese cake and cappuccino so damn good. We had a Fun time with GOOD HOMEMADE SICILIAN FOOD and a friendly staff that made it a memorable evening. We will be back for more Home made Sicilian food, Jokes and a lively entertaining cast & crew. Ciao my paisanos"}
{"text":"Jonathon is the best server in Vegas. Awesome guy. Made our experience so wonderful and the food was absolutely amazing. I'll be back again and again!!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend was craving Italian food, so I decided to go on a search on Yelp. We wanted somewhere close, but somewhere authentic too. Then we stumbled upon this glorious place.  I had spaghetti carbonara and my boyfriend had the linguini a la siciliana. There were ample clams and mussels in his pasta that left him satisfy. His pasta was full of flavor and simply amazing. My spaghetti carbonara had delicious cuts of prosciutto. Did I mention the plates were massive? They are beyond generous with their servings. I was in heaven.  Our wonderful server, Laura, was the sweetest thing on the planet. She was patient, funny, and gave us plenty of tips on their best meals. She suggested we get the #15 wine and it was one of the smoothest wines I've had. Thank you, Laura, for your kindness.   For dessert, we had cannoli, which was unbelievable.   A party was coming in who was celebrating their 50th anniversary - this is the place to do that, because the food and the hospitality is incredible.    The individuals who work here - you are beautiful. Thank you for being welcoming and warm. Thank you for having a sense of humor."}
{"text":"We ate here because my cousin gave us $125 worth of gift certificates.  Well you might say we went overboard with the orders; our bill ended up being about $165 for three people (and not because the menu is overly expensive).  In any case, the food was all very good and the service was excellent.  I'm incredibly full as I type this."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding!! One of the best Italian restaurant in Vegas :D   If you looking for authentic & traditional Italian food, this is THE place to go!   The Escargot is absolutely delicious! Don't forget the creme brûlée or tiramu are my favorite in town!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. This place is way too expensive for what it is, and the decor is dry. Our waiter was nice, but he may have been on acid or some substance. The calamari was very chewy and the batter was not crunchy enough. We had the ziti and speghetti and meatballs. They were both bland. In the end, we wish we went to another Sicilian/Italian restaurant. ANY other one."}
{"text":"Excellent food and amazing service. You want a family run owned real Italian meal. This is the place to come!!!! Love!"}
{"text":"We moved to Nevada from New York about two years ago and have tried many Italian restaurants since moving.  None have come close to what we were used to in New York.  None until The Sicilian Ristorante that is!   The food there is just as good as any back East.  The service was excellent, food authentic down home Sicilian and the bread hot and fresh!   It's our new favorite place and we can't recommend it highly enough!"}
{"text":"This is being generous, two stars. When you order \" Rack of Lamb\"  I did not expect to receive lamb chops. When it was stated to the waiter, of the gaming taste, he stated that the chef said the longer you cook them they get that way. That is the reason i ordered the Rack of Lamb medium rare. I did not order the lamb chops well done.    Very little help from the wait staff, that was clearly afraid of the cook.    One of the best things about living in Las Vegas is you never have to eat at the same restaurant twice. In the case of the Sicilian, definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior of the building fool you, this place has some very delicious Italian food! The staff was very attentive and dressed professionally. First we tried the garlic bread with cheese. It was tasty, though I would not say extraordinary. It was a bit dry. What was delicious was the pasta dishes. First of all, the portion was huge! I think there was a pound of pasta in each bowl. I had the angel hair Pomodoro. There was loads of garlic flavor, which I love. We also tried the pasta carbonara. It was creamy with crispy pieces of pancetta and cooked to perfection. I would say the only thing I found displeasing was the decor. The way the windows are blacked out makes it look like it is not an upscale place from the outside."}
{"text":"The food is very good but do not like the attitudes of the waiters.  They try to be clever but very abrasive and ball busters.  They have a come back for everything.  All we ask is just be nice.enough is enough!"}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant several times while driving through town. I never noticed before but I was charged extra for the sauce on my pasta. Since when does a restaurant charge for sauce. It was $7.95 on to of the price for the pasta. The food is very good and the service has always been great as well. Not sure if we want to go back. Just left us with a bad feeling to pay for your sauce."}
{"text":"Had the meatballs- fluffy & flavorful! Calimari and scallops are excellent! Expect to spend $100 for 3 courses for 2 and drinks but took home leftovers."}
{"text":"I guess it depends what mood your waiter is in when you eat here.  We went once and the waiter brought the wrong food.  When I asked him to take it back and bring me what I ordered, he flat out told me no.  I was never going to go back again but my husband talked me into.  The service we got the second time was much better but the food is just alright, or maybe I didn't get over the first waiter."}
{"text":"We drove down from St George looking for a nice lunch in Vegas. We had eaten at the Sicilian Ristorante before and hoped it would be as good. I ordered the osso buco again. It was perfect as last time."}
{"text":"Quite Simply the Best  ...from the  basic Menu Entre'  to the  specialties   Its  just an awesome  experience   You go to be  of an Italian  household  to appreciate  this genuine  touch   but   you need not be Italian  to appreciate Quality  ...   mmm"}
{"text":"Awesome savoring dishes.  Most delicious rack of lamb anywhere.   We miss Casey.  Escargot was very tasty that even my 7 month old son enjoyed with the garlic bread.  Very friendly service, nice ambiance, a hidden gem for Vegas."}
{"text":"So we decided to come here while being on the town. Being\"off the boat\" Italian, i thought why not-- how can u mess up Italian food?! Boy was i wrong.. I had gnocchi which tasted like they we freeze dried n rehydrated, my girls spaghetti were over cooked & the meatballs were dry! Our waiter did not help the experience at all and couldn't even look at us, not to mention kept pouring water in our Sprites. Never coming back!! Arrivederci"}
{"text":"It's been a family tradition to go to the Sicilian Ristorante for over 25 years; when it was the Sicilian Cafe just a building or so over. I love these guys- Pietro, the owner, the main dinner waiter Luis, Casey- everyone is awesome. (Luis should be in a movie- someone make that happen.) Service is amazing and old-school. The food is always great (and come hungry, portions are not small!).   When I come home to Vegas, I always have dinner here. For all the change that Vegas is constantly undergoing- I can always count on their good food and sense of humor. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"ah-maze-ballz!!!!! food was amazing, dessert was excellent! and definitely the service tied in all of the experience to an epic of epic epicness. If you do come here, Louie is awesome and he got spunk... fast and great service, makes you feel like you are welcomed at this sicilian house hold.  do try the tiramisu!!"}
{"text":"Fresh, old fashon home cooking with big portions. A little pricy for  traditional offerings. 'Could do exactly the same thing in my own kitchen. Would never go back."}
{"text":"I had a late lunch at Sicilian Ristorante on a Wednesday.  There were only 2 other tables.  The restaurant has a cool vibe, I bet it's great for dinner on a Friday or Saturday night.  White tablecloths, lots of pictures on the wall, small bar near the front of the joint.  Classic.  I had the prosciutto with roasted pepper sandwich.  It was good, but could have used some more meat.  I thought the roasted peppers were the best part of the sandwich.  I got some of the red sauce on the side.  It was thinner than usual, but had good flavor.  I would definitely get something with the sauce again, but not the sandwich.  They have specials that aren't on the menu, including osso buco.  I imagine I'll return and give that a shot, it looked fantastic."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I, dined here the evening of 7-30-2014. It was my birthday and we Gift Certificate. And I looked forward to that night for two weeks in our planning.  This was my second time here. And his first time.  WE LOVE IT! (I loved it my first time too)  We had JT as our server, he and the whole staff was attentive. The place was spotless, the lighting was subtle, food was fresh and the atmosphere pleasant. Clean restrooms. Bread from the oven was great.  This place is the best for Italian in the valley!  ..........I hate to name..names... but...  - Olive Garden . Food has no flavor. Carpeted floor often has food squished in. Loud kids. Tight sitting areas. Oh and did I mention - their food has no flavor... - Mezzo Bistro. (on Rancho in LV),  Loud kitchen noise. The servers either are overbearing or ignore you. And many were young and unrefined (for a place of that \"level\"). It was sunset - and the sunlight glares in unpleasantly. And we were still hungry when we left. My boyfriend said, he can make a spaghetti dinner from Dollar Store ingredients and it would taste better. -Battistas (near Koval and Flamingo). Terrible parking. And with no dish under $19 - this place serves you with PLASTIC cups.  We will be back again and again.   Thank you Sicilian Restorante!"}
{"text":"Food was outstanding. With HOWARD as your waiter it's like dinner and a show. Very professional and funny at the same time! This place is a must visit! All the food made from scratch and in-house it's worth the wait. We had a party of 7 and seated right away. Visit here and you won't be disappointed.  Ask for Howard he's the best waiter they have!"}
{"text":"Very authentic homemade italian food.  In vegas by myself and just wanted a good meal away from all the craziness of the strip.  As I was eating I listened to the older men at the table next to me speaking Italian and laughing and it brought back memories of my Sicilian grandparents and there brothers and sisters sitting around the table at family events.  I got emotional and had to go to the restroom to stop the tears.  The staff probably thought I was the \"crazy lady\" by herself crying....but it was not because I was alone...lol:). Thank you to the owner Peter who came by to chat with me.  Your place felt like home and your food and cannoli were great!!"}
{"text":"Drove by this place around dinner time, and thought, why not? Best \"why not?\" decision ever. Friendly staff, delicious food... a little pricey, but the atmosphere and overall experience made up for it.   Coming from a \"food is love\" kind of family, I appreciated chatting with an older Italian grandpa-type, whom I believe was the owner, and being chastised for not sopping up all the butter and garlic sauce from our escargot appetizer. He even went back to the kitchen to get a fresh new loaf of bread so that I could enjoy \"the best part\".   Loved it, and highly, highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I'm 100% Sicilian and it's hard to find good Italian restaurants. The food here is amazing. The service is awesome, and the atmosphere makes me feel right at home. Authentic Italian food!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in this place because the reviews were great. No one was there around 4:00pm. The service was great tho! Food was mediocre, Olive Garden is better."}
{"text":"Just moved to this neighborhood, and trying to discover all it has to offer. First up, Sicilian, which was recommended to me by a friend, when I was bitching that nobody in LV knows how to fry eggplant. Right off the bat, Sicilian gets 5 stars on their eggplant alone, it's absolutely perfect, and I dare say just as good as my wife's grandmother's eggplant. (Rest her soul) It had all the right prep, from being all iced paper thin, to being lightly floured, NOT breaded. And while I didn't ask, I'm guessing that they took the extra early step to let the slices sit in salt to take the bitterness out, because it had that sweetness that I've only ever experienced in the aforementioned Sicilian Grandmother's kitchen. Beyond that, the staff was witty, with a tinge of the Italian sarcasm that I grew up with, so I felt right at home. Decor is a little dated, and the plaza is a little run down, which might bother some, but please don't let it stand in your way of enjoying a delicious Sicilian meal. As for the moron that posted the negative review because he was put-off by the fact that they discourage you making changes to their preparations, I say this... Do you tell your mechanic how to do his job? Your accountant? How about your surgeons?? The point is, they are proud of recipes and preparations that have been handed down for generations, and they should be. So unless Charles M is a renowned chef, The Sicilian is better off without his patronage."}
{"text":"We r real Italian foodies that eat at Italian restaurants all over the world if u want the real deal try the Sicilian restaurant the food is just like Sicily the arancini  are the best you will find outside Sicily.  The food is a 10. Oh did I mention my has been Sicilian Carolyn P."}
{"text":"I went here primarily based on the reviews.  This is an old school Italian restaurant that still brings the food out on carts.  Overall the food was good but not great. The two young men that were servers were very good and attentive to all the guest.  I likely will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This was an amazing meal!  Our service was great, everyone was so nice and even though the food took a while it was SO worth the wait!  Around the table we had lobster ravioli, linguini with clams, eggplant parm and some other things.  Cannoli for dessert, hazelnut gelato, limoncello cake....all just amazing.  So this was not somewhere to go if you have time restraints or want a cheap meal. But if you want to enjoy a great meal, have great service and just enjoy the evening I recommend this place!  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Loved this resturant. Good food. Atmosphere like old Vegas. Good service. Went as a family & was treated like family. The food was excellent & i met the owners son who was so nice. Idk maybe because our name is Roselli, one paisan to another. We will always go back."}
{"text":"We've introduced family and friends to this wonderful restaurant over the years. I continue to go here even though I limit my carbs. The bread is hot out of the oven so I still have to have at least one bite slathered in butter. The salad is so crisp and has a very tasty creamy dressing. I highly recommend the Pappardelle Romano or the Eggplant Parmigiana. Howie is always a fantastic server. Serving sizes are more than adequate. I normally take half my dinner home in takeout.  My family took me here for my 60th birthday dinner in their private room. We even brought a friend who only eats vegan dishes and they prepared a special vegetable dish. Peter upholds his father's legacy in running a fine restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok, maybe it's just me, but the sign outside said lunch ends at 2:30 and dinner starts at 2:31....hmmmm. This is not Buger King...but seems they may be a bit inflexible.   I came specifically looking for a good Italian sub, but was there at 2:55. Really, a cold cut sandwich could not be made 25 minutes past the deadline. Really? Absolutely not, (part of the company policy I'm guessing), the young man gave a flat no...end of subject. C'mon, pretend to go back and see if there's any salami left. Nope...no is no.  Anyway, got the cannelloni, arrived quickly and hot. It was edible, but like a high school cooking class meal. Olive Gardens is way better.  Anyway, it's clean, staff ok,  price ok, but was disappointed in both the food and the unwillingness to accommodate what seems like a very minor variation.  Take note Sicilian Ristorante, inflexibility is not an appealing characteristic of a restaurant."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant last night for my grandma's birthday, and I can let you know now that we will definitely be back.  For starters, our waiter was absolutely hilarious. The waiter at one of our other favorite restaurants recently left, and it's important to my grandparents that they find a place where they can have a good time with the waiter who will reciprocate their humor. Our waiter, Howard, did just that. He was hilarious, and quick on his feet. He made our experience a lot of fun, and I know that he is probably the biggest reasons why my family will continue to visit this restaurant. Other than being super funny, he also made sure that my food had no dairy in it, since it is not something I can have. It might seem like a small thing, but there are many restaurants I have visited where the waiter could have cared less, so to have a waiter than remembered was awesome!  The food was delicious. For appetizers, we had escargot and fried calamari. I had never had escargot before, but Howard gave us suggestions on how to eat it for \"first timers\" and I was pleasantly surprised with how it tasted (I think I ended up having 3 or 4 pieces). The entrees took a while to come out, but all 6 of us agreed that our food was incredible fresh. I got the linguini calamari with red sauce, and I think I still have two or three servings sitting in my fridge - it's that big!   Overall, I was really impressed with my first time here. My grandma has been looking for an Italian restaurant to try, especially since her mother was Sicilian, so this place definitely hit the jackpot for her. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am writing this review based on a lunch visit.  There are no lunch specials and the service is slow. Good food, friendly staff....... But if you don't want a big lunch bill and a long lunch, I advise wait for dinner."}
{"text":"A break from Thai food !  There are a lot of Italian restaurants in Vegas, some good, some not so good. Not wanting to drive across town we decided to try a new (to us) place, of course checking yelp we came across this place.  So on with the important stuff, greeted at the door, seated quickly, bread delivered ( darn its good) orders taken, I went for the cannelloni, the wife went for the sea bass.  How can I put this Travis D has it pretty much spot on, the food reminded me of Olive Garden except, it was a lot more money and a lot less food.  My cannelloni was, well blah to be honest, the wife's sea bass was ok, not great, but the portion sizes were just way off for the price, I don't mind paying for good food, I do mind paying for ok food served in small portions.  There are better Italian restaurants in town for sure, even if it means having to drive a little."}
{"text":"Just okay, I heard a commercial on the radio saying that it was the best Sicilian  restaurant. I went there with my daughter and my wife and actually it was not that good. The flavor was pretty mild and the portions were very small. I should've known by the commercial when there is a little kid telling you it's the best Italian restaurant that the kid did not know any better because he has not tried much. We won't be returning.. Cute commercial but a 7 year old saying it's the best should have been the red flag..-my bad"}
{"text":"I'm super upset with this visit.   I've eaten here several times.  It's always been a warm and inviting atmosphere. The was no one at the front desk as usual.  My waiter was salty and over all unhappy which is the opposite of what I've ever experienced.  He gave me hell for being disappointed the was no blood orange sherbet.  I'm moving out of town and this was my last visit.  I left feeling yuck."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great place to eat off the strip this is not it.  The place is overpriced, the server we had spent the entire time telling us how bad it was to work their.  I can almost imagine how bad it must be if the radio commercial focus on his nephew or son being able to fix your computer almost while you eat. I think the true character of the owner is obvious in his public ads.  However, we still went to check it out, and we are still sorry that we wasted out money.  Better places to eat in the same location."}
{"text":"Loved!! Exactly as I thought it would be, real Italian food from a real Italian family. I was treated as Italians treat people, like family. So service above and beyond!  Food, oh my!! Thank you mama for making, it taste like homemade Italian food. The bread was fresh and the wine is from Italy. Who doesn't love Banfi!  I am so glad I have finally tried and I will be coming back with the Italian fiancé. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem of Vegas. Located about a mile from the strip, it is the place to try authentic italian Sicilian food . The restaurant is run by a Sicilian family. I ordered the Sicilian sausage with pasta, and it was yummy. Also the Sicilian red wine that they had was very smooth. I give this restaurant 5/5 for having a great service and good food for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This was amazing Italian food! Coming from New York, with an Italian and French family, I am so difficult to please!! The eggplant and chicken parmigian were amazing! The bread was delicious! We will go back..even though 40 minutes away..so worth it!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined last night at sicilian restaurant as we have several times over the years. This time was the worst experience we have ever had. We arrived and were seated. Our waiter came right over to take our order. I ordered a glass of wine and my husband ordered coffee along with the rest of our order. We waited and waited and waited and finally had to ask for our drinks from another waiter. He  seemed to take offense to our anger for having to wait the 15 minutes to get a drink and throws the coffee at my husband and asks Happy Now?  The food was less than it's usual standard.  And the over all  experience was upsetting and overpriced.  We will never go back. The parents who opened the restaurant have passed  it on to the children and it is certainly loss its charm."}
{"text":"1st we had an outstanding waiter named Howard, he was funny and knowledgeable and made a damn fine cocktail.  The food was delicious and you must try the lemon cake!"}
{"text":"LOVE.  MANGIA.  OMG.  WHATEVER.  I XOXOXOXO THIS PLACE.  I Yelped Italian Restaurants near our hotel and this came up, the reviews rocked and did not disappoint.  I expected a fun and family style experience, I got one.  I called and made a reservation for 6, they happily accommodated, we arrived, the fun begins.    We were seated immediately, round table for 6, conducive for conversation.  Our server, whose name escapes me, and I did not pay the tab so I don't have a receipt to reference...but reminds me of Michael Cera a little bit....was great.  On point, did some magic card tricks at the end, was funny and had good food recommendations...lovely service.    ALL the meals were delicious, no one had a single complaint on anything.  I had Prosecco ... was served in a regular wine glass not a champagne glass, but it was fine.  The bubbles just fizzle out faster in a wide mouth glass.  BF had Peroni, my mom had a half-gallon of red wine.  Everyone else had non-alc.    Food was on point, service was as well, we had a great time, and will ABSOLUTELY BE BACK.  And we have plenty of occasions to be in Vegas with my man's kid attending UNLV, so we will keep that promise.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very very delicious we tried the calamari excellent!!!! Very cozy place highly recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fairly laid back family eatery.  At first I was a little put off by the location.  Once inside it was a totally different look and feel.  You can tell this is a family business with the focus on the food and the service.  If your looking for that posh place that just wants to suck up to you for tips this isn't the place.  If your looking for great food, average service and a fair price go there.  I will go again it was a good experience and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! It's a throw back to how old Vegas restaurants were back in the day.   Service is excellent! Everyone greets you and are gracious for your business. The place is spotless clean which I'm super picky about and it has a cool Italy vibe going on.   Now let's get to the food! I have been coming here for about 8 years and let me tell you this. If you like authentic Italian food look no further! The portions are huge and I haven't had a bad menu item to date!   If you are looking for a classic little restaurant that takes you back to old school Vegas with a touch of class and excellent service you found it!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for Italian food and didn't want to do one of the overpriced strip hotel restaurants.   Settled on the Sicilian Ristorante based on online reviews.  Went on a weeknight and the restaurant was about half full.  I'm originally from Brooklyn and am used to good Italian food and was not disappointed.  I had the Fra diavolo and my wife went more conservative with the Chicken Parm.  We were both happy with our selections and the taste and quality was on par with the many Italian restaurants back East.  Was a bit pricey but I guess that's normal for Vegas.  The wait staff really enjoyed being there and made us feel very welcome.  It seemed that everyone in the restaurant knew each other.  Our waiter Howard was great.  He was attentive and had a good sense of humor.    We finish off with the Tiramisu that was one of the best I've had.  Would definitely recommend  this restaurant if you are in the area."}
