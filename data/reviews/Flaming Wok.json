{"text":"Way too sweet for my liking. Real authentic Chinese food isn't always sweet. In my opinion, if you like sweet taste this much, might as well eat candy bar dip in corn syrup as a meal. When I ordered my food a few years back from them, they put too much food coloring so much that it looked yellow. It was not appealing to me. But it has been years I haven't been there so they could have improved and better. I sure hope that's the case."}
{"text":"Very large portions, easily enough food for 2 people! Food is great tasting as well!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, good delivery times. Always pleasant delivery guys, great prices. Solid place to eat. I'm a regular purchaser of the fried pork and broccoli, never fails to deliver."}
{"text":"I would say this is one of the best Chinese take-out place in town. They have the best sweet-n-sour chicken for sure. They use white meat and you can seriously see and taste the meat (not just big-fat-flour coating). Sometimes I order their chicken finger (which basically a bigger/longer version of that sweet-n-sour chicken) too, when I am ordering other dishes as main course.   Their orange chicken or general tso's chicken are also good.  Same here, you can see and taste the meat (not just flour).  They each come with nicely steamed broccoli (yes, you can tell from the green color).  They make their own sauces, so each dish taste different, unlike those served in buffet places."}
{"text":"Today was my third time ordering from Flaming Wok, and again I am very happy with my meal. Everything I've ordered from them has been excellent, as well as their service. This has quickly become my favorite Chinese good take-out, and I just found out they have delivery! Thanks Flaming Wok!"}
{"text":"Besides PF Chang's which is all the way on the other side of town, this is the best Chinese Food I've had in Madison. The fried rice is delicious and savory. The white meat general tso chicken is yummy. They even have a \"diet\" menu which is basically variations of steamed veggies and chicken breast. It's the kind of Chinese you crave from your neighborhood spot that gets it right. Delivery is a bonus!"}
{"text":"Although the staff was friendly and the language was not a barrier for me as it was for others, the food I got was not very good. After I ordered the General Tso's Chicken, the woman turned on the fryer and, without waiting for the oil to heat up, she put in the chicken and my crab rangoon. Therefore, when I ate the food it wasn't crispy as a good General Tso's/crab rangoon  should be. Another thing that I noticed was that the chicken that she put in the fryer was sitting on the counter in the heat. *note: she hadn't fried any in quite some time which is why she had to turn the fryer on. The person that said the food was too sweet was right. Even though the menu said *spicy for my meal, there was no \"zip\" at all. Take it for what it's worth, but I know I will be looking for another restaurant to get my take out from now on."}
{"text":"We go here religiously whenever we are craving Chinese take-out (which happens a lot!) I could imagine this place is overlooked but it seriously has some of the best food in town. Service is fast and the food comes out consistently great every time. Order the pork fried rice, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"One liner for quick reads:  Fresh made Hot and Sour soup!  Yes...they make the Hot and Sour Soup when you order it...no gelatinous, nasty leftovers here.    Service can be a little slow, but definitely worth it.  Good overall food. Our favorite Chinese takeout.  (note...we always pick up, so I cannot comment on the delivery)"}
{"text":"They have the best egg rolls I have ever tried.  All food is fresh and made from scratch.  Large portions and low prices made this a no-brainer. A very large menu, which you can modify to your tastes."}
{"text":"Took 2.5 hours for the order to be delivered. Horrible customer service, and poor excuses for the food taking so long. Food was alright, nothing special. Would not order from here again."}
{"text":"Not a bad little Asian-American place.  I ordered General Tso's and vegetable fried rice to share with my girlfriend ahead of time.  They got the order done quickly, though the Tso's was not very spicy.  I ordered extra spicy and it didn't really have any kick to it.  My other negative comment is that the chicken wasn't the greatest.  I felt like I was eating mostly deep fried breading which was a bit disappointing.    Other than that I don't have any complaints.  The veggie fried rice was pretty solid (kind of hard to mess that up), and the flavor of Tso's was good despite the lack of kick.  For the portion size, price, and quick service I'll return to try some other dishes, but I wasn't terribly impressed."}
{"text":"It was delicious, but expensive for delivery. I had the cashew chicken (no veggies, so they gave me extra meat - thumbs up!), crab rangoon and a 2-L of soda. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I have been working on the east side of Madison and trying to find a good Chinese place nearby.  I tried this place and was disappointed.  I ordered online and asked for my food to be very spicy.  What I got was a large portion of very bland food.  Don't offer very spicy as an option if you are not going to live up to it."}
{"text":"Delivery came twenty minutes before the estimated time, food was the best general tsao chicken I've had in Madison. No silverware and the extra hot order is not that hot but everything was awesome."}
{"text":"Ordered the Mongolian Beef combo plate, I thought they would have put beef in it! Only rice and onions. They won't let me leave no stars"}
{"text":"I recently went back to this place to once again try their amazing food.  I gotta say that I'm once again very satisfied! Food, once again, is very good. I had General Tso's & Crab Rangoon. So Delicious! All provided at a very reasonable price.  Also, the employees who run/own this place are very friendly and nice to you, you can't really go wrong on either end!  Flaming Wok has always been one of my top choices in Madison for chinese food(I've lived here my whole life, so a long time!), and you can definitely not go wrong here!  I guess the only real down side is if you want to sit down and eat. Although they do have a few tables to sit down at, you are basically  sitting at the counter. There is no separation of order area and sit down area. It doesn't really bother me much, but I could see people being \"put off\" by this. Don't expect this to be a sit down restaraunt with their severely limited tables! If you don't care about that (as I usually don't, take out for the win!), this place is the place to go!"}
{"text":"First time in that mall. Stop pass there it was 3 people in line. OMG they give u so much food. I had left over for next day. It was so fresh and good. I will be back"}
{"text":"Their food is decent but so far we have ordered food from there twice for delivery. Both times, it took longer than an hour for our food to come, and we never received any kind of indication that the order had been received. The website we ordered through said to look for a confirmation email. Nothing. So both times we ended up calling them after we hadn't received our food and both times they had indeed received the order. So sure, go ahead and order from here, but don't do it if you're starving and need to eat soon, because you'll be very hangry by the time it comes!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was delicious. The food was fresh and the portions were generous. They even threw in some FREE chicken wontons! Service was good and prompt. We'll definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese takeout of all time. Anytime there is an issue they always make it right! Great food, great prices, just great all the way around!"}
{"text":"We found this place via Yelp when we drove through Madison. Don't let the exterior or interior be your judge! This place was great!! Great food, full flavor expansive menu and fresh veggies. The staff were fast and friendly! Will definitely  become a regular place for us as we drive through Madison!"}
{"text":"We have our faves from Flaming Wok- especially the combos. Always at least 2 meals worth and the option of pork fried or steamed rice is a nice option. Delivery is always fast and just what we ordered (for an extra treat, try the donuts & eat dessert first)."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. The owners were nice and would always be quick & friendly & the orders were accurate. The last 2 times in the past few months I didn't get what I ordered and it was over an hour for delivery. Tonight I ordered 3 items. They said 45 minutes, they arrived an hour & 15 minutes later. I tipped 25% anyway because I know it sucks to be busy. The only thing I actually cared about- egg drop soup, wasn't in the bag. I called right away and they told me that I should maybe try again next time. What?!!  I told them that they need to bring it because I paid for it already. They said 15 minutes. 45 minutes later (total of 2 hours since I started the order) they still weren't there. I called back to tell them to forget it and I will not be ordering from there again"}
{"text":"Convenience and the WonTon soup are the only reasons we get food from Flaming Wok. Everything is under seasoned and bland. Not only that but, none of the items, such as Sweet and Sour Chicken are nothing but meat. Nothing else. Where are the vegetables? No onions, green peppers, pineapple or cherries. I am dumbfounded. To be fair to this restaurant, I have gone to Happy Wok and gotten the same. I asked at the open restaurant at HyVee and the same thing. I have called many places only to be told that the people in Madison don't like a lot of their dishes with anything but the meat.  Is this true?   Bottom line - it is ok food if you want something quick and hot. Just make sure you check your order before you leave the restaurant or let the driver leave your house. They are 100% on missing something in our order. You also have to request any sauces and even fortune cookies."}
{"text":"I love Chinese food.  I've gone to nearly all of them in the Madison area.   This is perhaps the worst I've had.  I'm certain they do not use fresh ingredients.  The chicken I had taste like it had been cooked and left in a fridge for two weeks.  My wife and I actually left after our first bite.  I would avoid this place."}
{"text":"Love the place. Open late and consistent quality. The cooks also get the food out quickly."}
{"text":"Great to grab some quick Chinese food. The food isn't the best but it's pretty good. I wouldn't go out the way to come here but if I'm close by it's definitely an option.  It's located at Desert Sky Mall right by the Food Court entrance.  They have a good variety of choices and their portions are probably the best I've ever seen. My Wife and I share a plate as they pack it till the container can no longer close.  They are very courteous with the food portions but kinda stingy with the hot sauce and soy sauce.  Again not a must but if you're close by not a bad option."}
{"text":"I got sick.  The food was nasty.  The language barrier was rough as well.  Save yourself from uncontrolled vomiting and explosive diarrhea.....go anywhere else."}
{"text":"I have to admit the food probably would have been extremely good had when I sat down at the table I picked up the paper to put some pepper on it today and it came off and then I got a jar full of pepper on my food. I told the people at the counter that the lid came off on my food and I got a half a jar of pepper on my food and they just sat there and smiled at me and shook her head no but nobody offered to re-cook my food for me so I ended up choking down hot peppery lo-mein. I may come back but had they made the acrewup right I would have been extremely happy.  The shrimp egrolls are enormous and quite well.  Most other places have egg rolls ya need binoculars to see.... Not these!   Had they fixed the order I would have given a  4 - 4 1/2 star....."}
{"text":"I've been disappointed with many of the Chinese restaurants in Madison.  I ordered delivery from Flaming Wok. They food came in about 25 minutes, which was way better than another Chinese place that I've ordered from a few times and I'm waiting about an hour and a half. I got an order of the Crab Rangoon. You get 10 in an order!  Good bang for your buck - down side? It really lacked flavor. I also ordered the Cashew Chicken, there was SO much celery in it I thought that was the only thing I was eating!  The celery really overpowered the dish and so I really couldn't taste much else. My meal came with a Pork Egg roll. I did like it, though it was VERY oily.  They do have an extensive menu and I will probably give them another shot - but probably won't get the Crab Rangoon again - definitely not the cashew chicken."}
{"text":"Good stuff!  Had the sesame chicken, general tsa, pot stickers, and crab Rangoon.  All were great, and were ready quickly."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Chinese food I have found in the Valley very good, fresh big portions. good price. I am a big Chinese food ADDICT and this place is my place to go for Chinese food."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered from this place and it was okay. We got chicken fried rice, chicken Lo mein and Mongolian chicken. We both didn't really like the Mongolian chicken and the chicken lo mein tasted weird. But I did liked the crab Rangoon!!!! They have the best that I ever tasted!! I'll be ordering more from this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't good, tried to over charge us, delivery driver was extremely rude. We mentioned coupons on the phone and then when they arrived they acted like they had no idea what we were talking about. Food was cold."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place everytime I go in there. Its family owned and has consistently good food. Large soda selection with  awesome crab rangoon. My favorite dish is the Happy family which has beef, pork, chicken, crab, and veggies in brown sauce."}
{"text":"Easily the worst Chinese food that I've eaten. And I've eaten my fair share, trust me.  Our General Tso's Chicken was terrible. Very bland and overcooked. The flavor was also very strange, and tasted like ketchup. Just terrible.  The crab rangoon weren't much better. As I watched an employee take the frozen rangoon from the freezer and dump them into the deep fryer, I didn't have very high expectations, but wow. Mushy and weird-tasting.  The interior of this joint is also disgusting. Wallpaper is peeling off the walls, and in general it looked filthy.  Customer service was also really bad. When I finally got my food and said said my goodbye, the woman at the counter didn't even acknowledge me and went back to watching TV behind the counter. I completely understand the language barrier, but the 2 employees working weren't even trying.  The price I paid for the food was also way too high, considering the very low quality of my meal.  We stopped in around 6 pm and it was completely dead. I am really puzzled why this place is still open.  Avoid."}
{"text":"Food is average they make it fast two stars because staff is rude and food is just very mediocre"}
{"text":"One would think 12:30 is still lunch time and the food would be fresh. Think again. Whatever the best parts of the chicken are, they don't end up at this place. He only plus is that it gives you a giant portions. Unfortunately, I threw away 3/4 of my food due to poor quality. I had the orange chicken.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here last night. The delivery guy was right on time which seemed like a good sign...but the food left me feeling disappointed. I ordered the Chicken Chow Mei-Fun, and my partner ordered the Chicken Lo-Mein. Both had an odd smoky taste that was really off-putting (maybe from old oil??) We also ordered the sweet donuts which was the highlight of the meal.. you can't really go wrong with fried dough and powdered sugar ;) Our search for a go-to chinese place in Madison continues!"}
{"text":"**Abbreviated version: Food is good, but don't order delivery unless you want to be charged a $2 fee for it, wait a ridiculously long time, only to get soggy crab Rangoon and lukewarm food.   My boyfriend and I have ordered delivery from this restraunt several times before (partially due to ease of ordering, also due to lack of delivery for this type of food in our area). The fare is basically what you'd expect. Nothing mind-blowingy good, but good food at a fair price. The Crab Rangoon are delicious, and so is the roast pork and broccoli. The fried dumplings are also pretty tasty as well, although a bit too oily for my tastes.  My primary issue is with the delivery services. When I order delivery it's to save time and convienience. The restraunt is 6 minutes drive away, and when I ordered last night my food came late and it took over an hour to get a single entree and an appetizer. I was also charged a $2 fee for delivery that was automatically added to the bill.   To make matters worse the food was barely lukewarm. The crab Rangoon I had ordered had been sitting or steaming in their bag for so long they were no longer crispy. For the time it took to get my delivery I could have driven to the restaurant, ordered my food, ate it and gone out for ice cream and still been back before the the driver got here. It's even more sad that I can order pizzas from a delivery place 20 minutes away and get it faster than from Flaming Wok.  I won't be ordering from this place again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Let's see, I've been to a few Chinese take out places here and there in Madison and pretty much it's no lie they all have the same style menu. It's like one person owns all these Chinese restaurants or something. But let's get to Flaming Wok's food, their dough on the dumplings are slightly a little thicker than I would like but their dipping sauce is awesome and consistent. It has this smoky flavor to it that just makes it so tasty dipping the dumplings in to. If you're picky about your dumpling sauce and like it smokey I'd recommend the dumplings here. I tried their Dragon & Phoenix and it is pretty good. This has been the ONLY Chinese take-out that passes the fried rice test. My brother and I judge harshly when we go to Chinese restaurants and he always jokes about the fried rice test. The fried rice here is actually flavorful and a little smoky with all the right flavors and bits of roast pork or char siu in it. It is the only place I have found so far that has good fried rice. Most place have I have been to fail the simple fried rice test.  Every time I make my own fried rice at home it's always guaranteed to be gone. That's a measurement of how good your fried rice taste. The majority of places just throw a little salt or soy sauce into their rice and throw on-top some steamed vegetables and a little chicken meat or eggs and then call it good and label it fried rice. It is disappointing in the amount of terribly made fried rice at the majority of Chinese take-out restaurants. If you want fried rice done correctly this is the ONLY place to get it that does it right in Madison. Fried rice anywhere else in Madison I'll pass.  I wish I had time to try out their Roast Pork Egg Foo Young."}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese I've had in a long time! I ordered steamed dumplings and the chicken with cashews. Huge portions, very fresh (not overly greasy like some places), awesome value for what you get! I'll order again any day."}
{"text":"My girlfriend tried to place an order first but the lady hung up because she was trying to find the hotel phone number and was very rude to her. I called a few minutes later and she was honestly the rudest employee i have ever had to talk to.  The food was really good though. But this lady needs to not take orders."}
{"text":"Food is nasty seen the way they bring the food out and restock it. Not very yummy looking or sanitary"}
{"text":"This establishment has gone downhill. My food used to arrive hot and quite tasty. Lately it's been cold and pretty much inedible. Tonight was the worst. Don't order the Moo Shoo. It was terrible. I threw it away.  I am very sad to say that I'll be looking elsewhere for my Chinese. Sad because I used to rave about Flaming Wok, even recommending out of town clients to try it."}
{"text":"The food was so-so, but most irritating was they forgot all of the sauces that I asked for (sweet and sour, hot mustard and soy... they sent 1 packet of soy and one packet of duck sauce for an order for 3 people). I called to ask them to deliver some, but the girl told me they would remember to bring them next time. Paid $2 for a delivery fee and even tipped 20% ahead of time. I still had to eat dried out Chinese food. Not going back."}
{"text":"Best take out Chinese in East Madison.  Food is always fresh and well cooked.  Sometimes you have to make sure they didn't forget the rice - mainly when the woman who typically works the front counter is not there.  I have always found the service to be friendly.  Periodically, I have  even received free chicken dumplings or a soda.  By far the best Moo Shu I have found in Madison after living here for 15 years and trying several of the more upscale places in town.  FYI, there is a small seating area here but it is mainly a takeout place."}
{"text":"Well what can I say.  The food wasn't out of this world, but it wasn't bad either.  I would call it pretty middle of the road for the Madison area.  We ate in and you don't do that for the ambiance which is lacking.  I would go back, but I would likely take it home to enjoy there."}
{"text":"Just tried this out yesterday and was impressed with the quick service and the food. Enjoyed pork lo men and cashew chicken combo plates, also some of the best egg rolls we've tasted in Madison, will definitely be back again.  ."}
{"text":"Are you kidding? My wife and I went last night and were so glad we did. Their portions are ginormous and quality was top notch, especially the bourbon chicken. Wow! We will be going there quite often."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in town.  Yeah, I know, Madison is short on good Chinese.  However, this place has good prices, decent food and great service.  1 - Great customer service.  I put that first because it is difficult to find at carry out places.    2 - I had the steamed dumplings as my appetizer.  Delicious! HOT (temperature)! and very satisfying.  They are large in size and 8 in an order for $5.99.  3 - For our entree we ordered Chicken Lo Mein and Combo of General Tsao's chicken which came with a pork eggroll.  Everything was delicious and fresh.  The Lo Mein was hot and the noodles were perfectly cooked.  Nothing was over done.  The General's chicken came with pork fried rice.  You could tell everything was fresh.  It had great flavor.   The Flaming Wok was not anything new, but it was good quality.  The food was hot and delicious.  It was a fair price and the counter guy threw in some extra goodies.    Not to mention, after a long Target trip, you can call and your food will be ready in 15 minutes."}
{"text":"A one star review... Because I stood at the front counter for 15minutes while being ignored by the entire staff. I finally just walked out. The place wasn't even busy... The three workers today at 6:10 just didn't even want to acknowledge that I was there trying to place an order. I will never return."}
{"text":"Singapore dish was perfect!! And they even had my favorite nestea pomegranate & passion fruit .. Huge portions also!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, but the service is incredibly disappointing. If you're able to get the correct order with a modicum of politeness, the experience is decent (3/5 stars at best) but the service is abhorrent. Not only did the staff appear challenged in basic arithmetic and following simple rules, but we received rude responses to our natural objections to the inaccuracy of our bill and order. I suggest you take your business elsewhere in a town where good Chinese is plentiful."}
{"text":"Best Chinese take-out in town. They have the best pork egg rolls I've ever had. The woman who answers the phone and works the counter doesn't speak English very well and yells a lot but I'm willing to put up with that considering their food is so good."}
{"text":"The food was a little late (delivery) and it was pretty cold by the time it arrived. Flavor was decent by the Sesame Chicken lunch portion only came with two pieces of broccoli!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for takeout. The meat is more sound than usual Chinese take out"}
{"text":"Finally found me a fast food Chinese place that packs your container overwhelmingly so where it does not close. It's a little ways from where I live but it was damn worth coming out here.."}
{"text":"So I would possibly give it better reviews but nothing really tastes that great when eating it cold with your fingers. Biggest tip I could give this restaurant is when you get an order to deliver to a hotel would be to give them utensils!!! Especially if they request them! If people ask for a fork it isn't to cost you extra it is so we can actually eat the food you bring."}
{"text":"I was a bit afraid upon pulling up but this seems like a family of committed cooks.  The sesame tofu was large enough to feed 3-4 people, came with a pork egg roll and rice for only $8.00.   You seriously cannot beat the price."}
{"text":"Average food, fair prices. Wait time for delivery was over an hour both times I ordered. Most recently, 1.5 hours."}
{"text":"Ahh... yum!!! After my disappointing Chinese food experience a couple of weeks a go I was super happy to eat here! I got an order of vegetable Lo Mein, Fried Tofu w/Garlic sauce, and Shrimp w/Lobster sauce (my all time favorite). I was super impressed with the Tofu, the sauce was super yummy... and the lo mein was packed full of veggies! Half of it was practically veggies, which I love! The shrimp were all nice and plump but there were only 5... but then again I could always go for more shrimp. The lobster sauce was yummy but it was missing something... which I later discovered to be pepper! Overall I'm definetly a fan and I can't wait to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"This place is great. If you live on the east side do yourself a favor and get the happy family, lo mein, and fried pork wontons (wontons are a must!!)  I was a little thrown off when I first moved to the east side of Madison and drove past this place. It doesn't have much curb appeal but  I decided to go in to check it out anyways, the pictures inside were nice and the people are friendly and the lady even gave me free wontons since it was my first time, so it was a win win win!  Call ahead as they state on their website that they appreciate it if you do."}
{"text":"Quick, fast, and VERY hot! All things I look for with good take-out. I only tried the General Tso's Tofu - \"extra spicy hot\" for the heat level. It was a large serving (dinner menu) and had about 8 large pieces of broccoli. The dish came with a large serving of perfectly steamed rice - and I mean perfect! The tofu was cut smaller than most places so it had even more of those crispy edges that make it have such a delightful texture! The only down side was the sauce was not hot at all - very lackluster in the spice department; but still tasty. I just added some hot sauce to compensate and it worked for me!   I'd pick up from here again as there seems to be a lot of options and so far so good! They also had specials listed on a white board inside - probably worth checking into if you have the time to go in and wait for the order!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent.  But I think all Chinese in Madison is pretty decent.  Nothing has truly blown me away, this place included.  While staff is nice and carryout is quick, food I ordered (veggie fried rice and Mongolian chicken) just didn't have much flavor. Like at all. The menu is extensive, though, and maybe I need to head back there to try more of it? They make a big claim that if you don't see it on their menu they'll find a way to make it, however that didn't hold true when I asked about Cantonese pan fried noodles... an item that seems near impossible to find in this town."}
{"text":"Me, my wife and daughter and grandbaby ate here and the orange chicken was so bad my daughter threw up, and they seriously waited a few minutes to fix it"}
{"text":"WOW - I can't say enough that you should absolutely not give Flaming Wok your business. I placed an online order in advance for dinner at my office.  I try to do this when placing large orders so the restaurants know that a large order will be coming and can be staffed appropriately. My order showed up two days early and when I called to make sure that my order would again be coming at the correct time the woman on the phone SCREAMED at me for over 7 minutes.  She said it was my fault and that I was 'greedy' and just wanted more food. I clearly placed the order for the next day.  Eventually I asked if there was someone else I could speak to and she hung up on me.  I'm trying to resolve the issue with ChowNow (the online ordering system) but I will never ever order from them again after the way I was treated by the woman on the phone.  So terrible."}
{"text":"Ordered online for 5:30pm. The food arrived EXACTLY at 5:30pm. I kid you not. We ordered pretty much the standard items: Shrimp Lo Mein, General Tso's Chicken, dumplings, crab rangoon and chicken wontons.   The food was fresh and hot. Packaged really well. Good portions. Just enough broccoli with the General Tso's. I could maybe use a little more heat next time.   Overall, for the price, quality of the food and speediness of delivery, I was impressed. Not thee best I've ever had, but definitely worth repeat business.   Update: not sure why I can't make another review because this is 2 months later. We order Kung Bao (should of been King Pao) but whatever we ordered was tiny little chopped up chicken with peanuts and a ton of veggies. Not very good or even spicy one bit.   They said the order would take an hour. Showed up in like 30 minutes. So big stars for that BUT they screwed our order up. Ordered a large shrimp lo mein, but it came in a tiny (white rice tiny) container. Called, said they would refund the difference. At least they admitted it was their fault.  What we ordered this time around didn't seem as fresh or as good as what we ordered 2 months, which was basically the same thing. Not a huge fan I guess anymore."}
{"text":"The food came exactly when I requested it to be delivered.  Everything was piping hot.  Portions were generous and they even slipped in an extra egg roll.  Very impressed!"}
{"text":"As far as take-out places go in Madison, this is my favorite. Consistently tasty, fair prices, large portions, and friendly employees.   I am eating microwaved general tso's chicken from last night and it is still awesome.   Excellent steamed dumplings and egg rolls."}
{"text":"This is hands dowm the best Chinese restaurant in Madison,  if you think different you dont know Chinese food.  I was ordering from downtown restaurants continuously disappointed and about to give up and found them. Finally someone who doesn't put sugar in the EGG foo young gravy. Ive been all over the menu since and am never disappointed. Only issue is im downtown and delivery can be at least a good hour, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Definitely not the best Chinese food I've ever had. It's was decent enough for takeout (it curbed our cravings) but I've had way better in Madison. We also ordered both of our dishes extra spicy and they were both sweet. They don't put much spices in their food and the pot stickers were soggy."}
{"text":"One of the very few Chinese restaurants on the east side of town that delivers, and in my opinion the best. Sorry to say it seems all the chinese restaurants on this side of town are dropping like flies, and disappearing. I always order the szechuan chicken here and am always happy. Great taste, fresh ingredients. The crab rangoon is also good, compared to most others. Recommend the delivery or pick up. Tables in the establishment are few, and it's loud. Between the wife, who's at the front counter taking orders and hollering them (and I don't know what else), back to her husband, who cooks in the kitchen, banging pots and steaming sizzling foods, it's quite difficult to have any sort of conversation, or possibly any thoughts of your own. Ha, ha."}
{"text":"Flaming Wok lost a customer today. The place is close by work so I always organize group lunches through them. Over the month, they sometimes forgot rice, sometimes charges a \"free \" item, and they never gives out utensils. Today I did a pickup and they forgot the pancake and plum sauce, pretty important components of a mooshu dish. I called and asked them to deliver since I have a meeting, they played the we don't have a driver card, I asked them to deduct $2, they played the \"manager not here card and hang up.\" So luckily there is the online review community. I would recommend do pick-up from Sumo which is on the same street, and guaranteed much cleaner kitchen and dining room."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Roast pork Loimein it prob one of the best ones in town.. I always order the roast pork lomein from this place.. work a try"}
{"text":"Still good but I tried the Chicken Fried Rice.  Don't bother.  The chicken was tasteless.  All they did was steam it.  The seasoning was all in the rice.  Disappointing.  I thought fried rice was an industry standard."}
{"text":"The food is decent to good. Not knock-your-socks-off, but good. I thought it was even better the second day after it had been marinating in its juices in the fridge for awhile. The big plus is that portions are humongous. Really incredibly large (that's what she said). And prices are low. Can't argue with that! Plus it tastes like quality meat. I got sesame chicken & it was all clearly real chicken, not that pressed fake crap loaded with preservatives or made from chicken beaks and feet. I'm talking actual white meat. The good stuff. The restaurant doesn't have the greatest ambiance, but just pick it up after work and enjoy in the comfort of your own home. Yum!"}
