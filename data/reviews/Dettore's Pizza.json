{"text":"I always love getting good food here. Pizza is always fantastic and so is our service. Love the garlic sticks, but I just wish they delivered.... Then again, tanning while waiting works too, lol"}
{"text":"Best pizza around, at least when the older lady is working. I wish I knew her name, but l refer to her as Mamma Detorre. When she's there, she makes every pizza, so patience is deliciously rewarded. The only time we were disappointed, she wasn't there.   They also have some surprising treats on the menu. My favorite is the Reuben calzone, but tonight I'm trying the deluxe Italian hoagie, which I saw as a tip on here & it sounds yummy.   This is the only pizza around (I use that term loosely, we're almost half an hour away) worth picking up. They don't deliver anyway, but they do take cards now. When they're busy (especially weekends) asking for well done makes it easier to eat. They don't leave it in long enough to harm it."}
{"text":"I expected more from the pizza...nothing special and it was a 45 min wait.  The sauce is pretty good...not real sweet, just right.  But the dough, is just average at best.  I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Best pizza in PA by far!!! It was so good!!! We just got ham and pepperoni and it was the bomb!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in the valley, and possibly the best pizza in the eastern US. Sometimes slow in the evening, but always worth the wait. I have friends who will drive over an hour to take one of their pies to go. The magic is in the crust, and the cheese quality is fantastic. It's definitely more expensive than other options in the area, but it's 100% worth it."}
{"text":"I liked everything about the pizza except the crust. It is very thin and has no real taste. kind of like good sauce and topping on cardboard. it will do, but not my favorite.  came back tonight and had to lower my review based on a bad review. ordered by phone and was told the wait was 50 minutes. I showed up an hour later and was told it wouldn't be ready for another 15 minutes. get some help. There are about 6 people in here all waiting."}
{"text":"Ok I lived the Philadelphia and have had great pizza.  This place makes my top 3!  You may wait a little longer but it is worth it!  Try the white pizza  with the sliced tomatoes! Only wish they had delivery.  Other wise they would get 5 stars."}
{"text":"Like others have said, they don't deliver. I walked in and they took my order right away (a small pep, bacon and anchovy pizza and half Italian sub). Then told me to wait for a half an hour. I got to say...it wasn't anything special.   The sub was lightly baked and didn't have the crunch and melted cheese I like. Again...it was ok..just not great. The pizza was light on anchovies and sauce for me. The crust was ok and the sauce was mediocre in flavor.   After reading the reviews, perhaps I expected more. Everything was \"average\" in taste. They did load up the bacon so that was a plus. It was also very greasy. I couldn't recommend going out of your way for this as I did. DaBuzi in Finleyville is a far better tasting pie and I would highly recommend them thus far in the mon valley as far as the \"best\" pizza."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place 5 stars because the food is really really good. The bread sticks are my absolute favorite- smothered in garlic butter- but their ranch is TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!! hands down the worst I've ever had- if they changed it to a good home-made buttermilk recipe, I would have zero complaints about the food.  Now unfortunately, the last 2 times I have ordered from here, my order has been wrong. First time, I ordered a white pizza with no tomatoes, and it came with tomatoes. Not a huge deal...I didn't want to wait and have them remake the whole thing so I just picked them off.  The second time, they mixed up me and another customers order, so I got someone else's food and they got mine. Luckily I caught it before I left, but the other customer was already gone. Had to wait another 45 minutes for them to remake my order.  Update: ordered another white pizza just today and as normal, I order with extra cheese and no tomatoes. The guy who took my order even read it back on the phone correctly so I figured no problems. WRONG. When I went to pick it up, it was EXTRA TOMATO and NO CHEESE! I would have laughed if I wasn't so hungry and irritated that I had to wait another 20 mins for them to remake it. They're lucky their food is so delicious....when it's RIGHT! Im starting to wonder if this happens so often, that it's the reason they lift the lid and show you your pizza before you leave.   I think the issue is they get too busy sometimes and I understand it's easy to get things wrong, but I think as a business who depends on repeat customers, if you mess something up, make it right by maybe offering a small discount or a coupon for next time or something of the sort. I'm not asking for an entirely free meal by any means..just a little something to make up for the inconvenience.  Just my opinion!"}
{"text":"Terrible.  Was ordering a sub but the guy at the front was such a rude prick i demanded my money back."}
