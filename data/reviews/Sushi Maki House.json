{"text":"I went there last week and had 15 pieces of sashimi and some rolls and they were really fresh and biggg So goood!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurant around my work place. They have fresh sushi and great quality. There are lots of parking spaces in this mall and great location. If you look for sushi around this town this is the place."}
{"text":"My parents live in the area of this restaurant (which was formerly a noodle house). Having become weary of the usual national chain fast-food options in the area, I decided to try Sushi Maki House for a quick lunch. I ordered two kinds of sushi: spicy crab and spicy scallop, as well as assorted tempura. The service was excellent: the chef was friendly and helpful. The sushi was tasty and the portions were just right. I tend not to prefer a larger sushi roll because they are difficult to eat without making a huge mess. I will definitely return to this new neighbourhood favourite."}
