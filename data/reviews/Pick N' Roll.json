{"text":"I wish I could eat here every single day. Get a sushi burrito with spicy creamy sauce and try all the toppings! However, bring your patience and sense of humor. The staff is extremely friendly but the ordering and paying process can result in some confusion at times."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Did the plenty plate I think it's called added everything with it including the fish eggs. I only picked up water (free) to drink but the service is good they utilized all the space they had plus I've been going for lunch often. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy, delicious and the best service. Staff was very helpful. I will be coming back"}
{"text":"Best Poke restaurant hands down, nothing comes even close! Why?? First, they use purple rice which actually tastes better than white and much better for you.  Then, the toppings are made fresh not like some massed produced places. The portions are enormous actually and they do not limit you on toppings. You do get 3 scoops of protein which even includes octopus. I drive out of my way to co here even though there are a few others down the street from me.  It's a bit hidden by the movie theater so look for it!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Price is more reasonable than I thought. Lots of things to choose from. It's nice to have a healthy option around here that isn't too expensive."}
{"text":"This is our favorite poke bowl place. The best bang for your buck. The purple rice is off the charts. Everything is fresh and served with a smile. Portions are better than any poke place I have been to. If you have gone here yet, you need to. It's between YC's and the roadhouse theater."}
{"text":"I was very excited that they opened a poke place so close to my gym. Some days I'm so busy, I barely have time to grab food after the gym. First impressions, it was clean and a nice location. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. I came for the poke salad, it was a little confusing compared to some of the other poke places around here. (Example: signs don't say how many scoops of protein you get, also no signs next to toppings so you're left guessing) I think they could rearrange some of their salad items around so they didn't have to go from the middle section (salad) back to the first section (toppings). It could be problematic during busy hours. I also wish the dried toppings were at the end of the line so I could have it sprinkled over my poke for extra flavoring. I love that they don't skimp on the salad like some other places do. The poke tastes alright for the basic poke places you find around here. My main complaint is that they drowned my salad in the poke sauce. By the time I realized they weren't going to stop soon and I got the words out, it was too late. My salad tasted like a really salty soy sauce flavor. I couldn't finish the salad and had to rinse my mouth with water to wash down all the salt. I love purple rice, my mom used to make it for me growing up, unfortunately the bottom half of my rice scoop was drowned in the sauce and I couldn't bring myself to eat it. The initial bite of the kimchi topping (before I ate the salad) was good, but after eating the salad, I couldn't even taste my kimchi anymore. I will give this place another try but next time tell them to use the sauce sparingly. I think my experience would have been more positive if not for the excessive sauce."}
{"text":"Great place!!! Come to this place if you want high quality and great costumer service. The staff was great."}
{"text":"I love this place and eat here often! The food is always fresh, they have large portions, and the staff is always so friendly.  :)"}
{"text":"They don't have a bunch of unique or crazy rolls but what they do have is really good.  The value is where this place gets 5 stars though.  The prices are unbeatable on sushi rolls and everything I had was fresh and tasty while the forbidden rice just adds to it.  I had it delivered from Uber Eats so looks like I just found my go to for sushi at home.  Based on other reviews I'll have to try a Poke Bowl next time."}
{"text":"Fresh and healthy! I like this new poke bowl place that recently opened! The portions are large and the ingredients are fresh. I recommend trying the tuna and salmon poke with their sauce instead of on the side. Everyone was very friendly and helpful! I think what stands them out the most is this signature purple rice. It's been awhile since I've had purple rice and I'm glad that they offer it! Tastes great! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Really solid poke place! What immediately jumped out to me was that there are a few different options at this location than other similar poke places. 

It's a smaller store though, there's outside seating but only a few tables inside. They have a grab n go area to the left as you enter, which has premade selections/rolls and beverages. To the right is where you can make your poke bowl. They have cups and water readily available next to the grab n go area which is nice. 

The purple rice immediately caught my eye. Score! I love this stuff and haven't seen it at any other poke place I've been to yet. Amazing. I will say though you can either get purple rice or salad. Those are your only two base choices. 

They also have eel sauce (among a pretty large collection of sauces in general) which is my favorite. They have a good selection of toppings, some which are absent at other places (red cabbage, spicy and regular crab salad, carrot). 

The portion sizes are absolutely worth the value. They have two sizes: plenty (2 scoops) and Godzilla (3 scoops). I got the plenty size and it was a LOT of food. I went with tuna and salmon, cucumber, seaweed salad, crab salad, red onion, masago and carrot. I topped it with eel sauce and a little bit of spicy mayo. It was a really good bowl, great flavor and I almost couldn't finish it (and I can eat a lot). 

Service was friendly. I noticed most people were getting their food to go for what it's worth. I'd sit outside during the winter months for sure though. My total for my bowl alone was just under $11.

Overall I recommend, especially if you've never had purple rice or like a larger variety in toppings."}
