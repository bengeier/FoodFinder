{"text":"Visited the restaurant after reading all the rave reviews and I was not disappointed. I arrived around dinner time, so it was no surprise that it was very packed. While there was a small line up, we were able to grab a table  for 2 within 15 minutes.   Every dish looked amazing. They start you off with a small appetizer of kimchi and pickled vegetables, as do most Korean restaurants. We ordered the bibimbap,Dongatsu and the ham kimbap which all arrived very quickly. The bibimbap was by far my favourite, with super fresh crispy veggies and flavourful beef. Personally, I like my dishes on the spicy side so it was nice for them to give you a sauce bottle( not sure what exactly it was, spicy bean sauce, I presume). Though I wish it could have been hotter, I guess next time I'll go with the bibimbap in the stone bowl to keep it hot throughout the meal.    I would definitely recommend this place, and it looks like there are plenty of regulars who stop here for a quick meal. It's a bit tricky to maneuver around the tables though, especially when it's around dinner time as the restaurant is very small."}
{"text":"Checked the opening time on Google, which says it's open, then walked a long way only to find out that the restaurant is closed for half a month, which already happened once last year, with only a very small notice on the door."}
{"text":"In one sentence, it's average. I gave it a 3.5 instead of 3 because I love Korean food.   Pros: (+) Affordable price point (+) Easy access/great location (+) Great selection of Korean food  Cons: (-) Not the best quality of food (-) Have gotten sick from eating here before (-) A little cramped in terms of space"}
{"text":"delicious! I came here a few years ago when it first opened and wasnt at all convinced. I had had a kimchi pancake that time which was drenched in oil and impossible to finish and a very mediocre bibimbap. this time around, my friend had the dolsot bibimbap and i had the vegetable tobboki and we shared an appetizer of spicy tuna tartare on zucchini slices (about 6 pieces for 8$) everything was absolutely fresh and delicious, albeit very spicy. i love spicy food and even for me it was just a tad too much but i still scarfed it down cause it was too good. will be coming back very soon that;s for sure!"}
{"text":"Great place for students with a tight budget but looking for a satiating, heavy, greasy meal. Atmosphere is ok. Busy and there tends to be a lineup."}
{"text":"The restaurant, having lately been under renovation since the past few months, now has a new modern aspect to it with a plasma TV at the back showing many KPOP video clips. I've been there two times till now, and have never been disappointed. The menu being very inexpensive, is in both English and Korean language, and mind if I say, all food being typically Korean only and starts from 5$ to perhaps 15$. Unfortunately, the size of the restaurant is quite small, therefore does not offer much personal space for us, clients. Consequently, at week-ends and time-offs, the restaurant is packed, and many have to wait in line outside (depending of the hours, the line isn't always to long of a wait). We were 6 at the second time I went there, and have bought approximatively 7 plates or more which we all shared together, the total coming out for 68$ in total. I definitely recommend this place for any Asian, Korean food lover ^^', while the food is also very delicious and exquisite, it's at the same time very inexpensive!"}
{"text":"The best Korean restaurant in downtown if not in town. There's always a line up but if you're feeling lazy you can always pick up something to go. Opens late in the weekends too which is a plus. They make excellent bibimbap!!"}
{"text":"The quirk about Ganadara is that they single serving noodles come served in the single serving pot that it was cooked in. Part college throwback or part efficiency, I know what you're thinking, how the hell can a restaurant get away with serving instant ramen, and if that's a viable business model, why the hell didn't I think of that myself. Ganadara served packaged instant ramen, souped up like Civics. In Korea, (I am hesitant to use the word \"ramen-house\") but spots to cop a bowl a ramyeon are treated more as almost cafés here. A culture in itself, these types of places are by the younger Korean crowd, made for the younger Korean crowd - small informal spots that look like a teenage girl's bedroom covered in sticky-notes, cute visuals and more often than not, blaring the most recent of K-pop boy bands... whoa whoa whoa... not that I know what the bedroom of a teenage girl looks like."}
{"text":"Quick and simple Korean food. Definitely seems like the hot spot for all the young people. Always a line outside but it moves super fast. I liked that they had different takes on tokbokki, but the bibimbap wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"It used to be my favorite place downtown. Unfortunatly, the taste changed a lot and the quality is not what it used to be."}
{"text":"Great Korean Fusion and traditional style food. Went twice during our short trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"This is a place that serves Korean comfort food with reasonable price (used to be even cheaper before they renovated it). Really like their dak ball and tobboki, but I feel gross every time after eating their food because the dishes are so heavy and mostly fried.   To me this is a cheap eatery for students living in the neighborhood. Just get takeouts, it's not worth lining up for 30+ minutes."}
{"text":"This is not fusion nor authentic. Called it fusion to get away with certain things like short cuts in making food. Bon chon only came with a sweet pickle \"kimchi\" (usually korean restaurants come with 3 different side dishes at the very least). Usually sweet pickle and kimchi are separate, maybe that's where the fusion came from. Kimbap, Katsu, and Kimchi Jiggae was average. Ramyun was literally from the instant packs you could buy at any Asian supermarket. Dagkalbi was also nothing to rave about. Place was decent but with the line up and hype from Yelp, it definitely was not worth it. Been to Korean restaurants in Seoul, LA, and Toronto - their most average Korean restaurants there are better than this."}
{"text":"It's a great Korean cuisine, food is spicy, try kimchi Jiegae with pork, it's awesome, always full house, ambience is nice!"}
{"text":"Did the quick lunch thing and loved it. Bibimbap was pretty close to best in town. Atmosphere very relaxed and can get crowded and BUSY around lunch time, but well worth the wait. Oh yeah, under 15$ all in and a great deal for the meal. Enjoy..."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there just because every time we went by there was forever a long line... It is indeed good!  We got beef noodle, fried meat ball, and a seafood appetizer (can't remember their actual names), all recommended by the staff, and all were really great! Will go there again and try more!"}
{"text":"Excellent!.  As a visitor to Montreal staying in a hotel nearby, we passed by several times to see lines always. So we had to check it out. Did not disappointed."}
{"text":"J'étais à l'avant d'une grande file d'attente donc je n'ai pas à le plaindre. Le service est au point ils sont tous sympathique de la musique coréenne. J'ai eu une expérience sympa. J'ai pris des tteobeokki et des Kimbap au thon c'était vraiment bon ! Peut-être les tteobeokkis étaient trop sucré a force mais c'est certain que c'est les plats sont bon et les prix abordables !  J'y suis retournée une deuxième fois... La serveuse m'a vraiment pressé pour que je choisisse mon menu, j'ai attendu longtemps et ils m'ont même pas donné le Kimchi avec. Comme c'était l'ouverture du restaurant ils devaient manger mais la serveuse voulais même pas à la base me donner la carte j'ai du la demander et ensuite pendant que je regardais elle est restée à côté de moi cétait vraiment stressant. Ils m'ont même pas servi d'eau, j'ai du demander et quand j'en voulais encore ça ne me voyait pas. Je suis déçu j'avais vraiment adorée la première fois... Après tout dépend du personnel."}
{"text":"Le curry au poulet n'était pas très bon. Dès la première bouchée je n'aimais pas le goût de la sauce. Le bibimbap végétarien est ok, le tofu frit sur le dessus est excellent mais le reste était sec."}
{"text":"I was craving for some Korean food and saw that this place was highly recommended. Naturally there was a line up, but we were seated within a reasonable amount of time.   The decor is very minimal, with Kpop videos playing in the background, under all the conversations going on around you. A lot of tables and chairs were squeezed in to maximize on customers, so definitely not the best setting for larger groups.   There were so many good food options. I went with the traditional bibimbap. I like how they gave a bottle of the hot sauce on the side, I find that often times in other Korean restaurants there is not enough of the sauce provided. The bibimbap tasted delicious, it's interesting how this restaurant adds some yellow peppers to their dish.   As for the kimchi that came with, it was nice and chilled but not as flavourful as I am use to. But still pretty decent. At other Korean restaurants, generally meals come with 4-5 different small cold side dishes, whereas we only got the one small platter of kimchi."}
{"text":"Very good rice cake, maybe too spicy for non-Koreans. Long line, take out recommended."}
{"text":"DON'T GO if your allergic to sesame seeds!!!  I have been there a couple of times with friends and I would have given a 4. However, when I went with my sister we asked before we sat if it was possible to not add any sesame seeds products and they said yes. When seated, when told the waiter no sesame seeds or oil, and he said just a little bit, we said no she's allergic. It's when we got out when she had her  a really bad allergic reaction. We were clear and it's unacceptable that something like this happened. Nobody deserves this, please don't go if your allergic to sesame."}
{"text":"So excited to have another awesome Korean restaurant in Montreal, seeing that my old time favourite became that Korean barbecue place on St. Cat's. As enormous fans of Kpop and all cute things, this restaurant fits my boyfriend's and my taste. They have really cute Konglish wall decals of cats, dear, and birds all over, not to mention they have 3-4 clocks (!!). They tried to make it a very fairy tale-esque, with its \"vintage\" analogue clocks and all.  The menu itself was a bit confusing, as it doesn't have any price listed. The price for each dish is listed on the black board on the left of the restaurant. We sat right below it, so we were tilting our heads to get a good look at the price.   We ordered a stone pot bibimbap, mandu, and dulbokki (my BF ordered something with pork and rice), and everything was so delicious! We had leftover, so we packed up our dulbokki and had it for the following days.  Can't say enough good things about this place. Will visit again."}
{"text":"My favorite Korean restaurant in Montreal. You have to be lucky to not stand in line for a table. Easier for 2 people then for larger groups. MY friend from Korea also loved the food. Once you get a table the service is really quick. So you dont have to wait to long for your food."}
{"text":"Ganadara is easily the most affordable korean restaurant in town (even though the prices went up). It's very convenient and friendly. Although I've been there multiple times and have already tried everything on their menu, I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"the ramens taste exactly the same as the one i buy at the market. like they literally served us ramen noodles from the package. this restaurant is a total disappointment"}
{"text":"This place was super busy on a weekday at around 6:30, and the single waitress was handling herself really well.  I had spicy ramyun and my husband had bulgogi ramyun, and they were both tasty and warming on a cold day.  I would have liked to have tried some of the appetizers or kimbap (which looked like korean sushi--not sure if that is actually a thing), but I wasn't hungry enough--next time!  The only thing I didn't like was that the ramyun was served in the pot it was cooked in, and the flat bottom made it difficult to eat all the broth and noodles--I would have preferred a ramen bowl.  Oh, and super cheap too--great for students!"}
{"text":"This is a nice unassuming place with cheap and solid satisfying dishes!!!  The chicken here is good, I had the chicken with Ganadara sauce, tasty not too sweet with a side of beer and it feels like you're in Seoul on a side street somewhere just nibbling on snacks.  The ramen is the dried type that you rehydrate, but they make an amazing broth to put it in, it's like hangover food korean style.  The paejeon (pancake) is crispy, I had the one with bacon in it, oh so good. tobboki was very nice too really hits the spot.   I love this place, nothing fancy, just lots of comfort and cheap, definitely recommend it :)"}
{"text":"Yummy Korean food for very reasonable prices! This was my first time coming here and I was a bit apprehensive at first because my experience with Korean food in DT Montreal hasn't been the best but this place did not disappoint!  I and my friend came around 2:45pm on a Friday, yes, there was a line but it wasn't too long when we got there. I ordered the Cheese Chicken Katsu ($13 before tax) and it was really good. I very much like cheese and there was a good amount of it in ratio to the chicken katsu; I also thought that cheese and rice would taste weird but it wasn't a problem for me. We didn't wait too long for the food to come out and it was delicious when we finally got it.   Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"The seafood soup it very good!! But don't try the kimbap which is the Korean sushi, it's really not goodand don't try that rice cakes, it's totally not the right taste"}
{"text":"Was SO good. I ordered recommended beef soup and recommended pork roll. I wanted more but had to stop myself. Probably favorite place I ate in Montreal. Be careful..long line awaits! And hours have day breaks."}
{"text":"This is a great find. Good prices, traditional Korean food that tastes great and authentic.   I lived in Korea for a while and this is the first time I had chamchi kimbap (kind of like a Korean style tuna sushi) that tasted just like the kimbap I remember.  I highly recommend it. Especially since the price is a great $5.50.   The vibe and food is more a lunchtime atmosphere, small place/quick service, but it is good for a simple dinner. They don't serve alcohol (or soju). But you get the regular free side dishes with your meal (both times I was given two kinds of kimchi - spicy and pickled).   For a good meal, I recommend:   -Dak Balls (deep fried chicken) and a Chamchi Kimbap (tuna/rice roll)  or  -Hot (Dolsat) Bipimbop (a rice / vegetable / meat stirfry that cooks in the bowl you get).  Each meal will run you about $10.   I highly recommend this place. I will go back many times. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"We got potstickers, bulgogi rayuman and bibibap and our total was only a little over $20! What a deal for such delicious food. Personally I preferred the bibibap (nothing can beat the crispy rice that forms on the bottom of your bowl) and was not super impressed with the rayuman. The place is a bit small so is ideal for couples or small groups. We got there around 630 on a Friday and it was a full house. The food comes out really quick so we didn't have to wait long to be seated or to be served. Would definitely go there again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"The ramen is hot and spicy. The mood Is chill. My food came in a saucepan!  What?  It's super fun and charming here. The wall decorations are super hilarious and cute, and the rest of the food we got was delicious. People are nice too. A table moved over so our group could sit. Very nice. We also had the curry pork cutlet (not spices but excelkent) and the spicy pork (also excelkent). All in all --yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Cute small korean place in downtown. Their food is pretty good. However, their kimchi that they served as side dish is quite different from other korean restaurants, not my kind of taste/kimchi. Otherwise, you gotta try their unique teokkbokki poutine and their teokkbeokki cheese! Since, they renovated their place, there's a lot more people going there so don't be surprised if there's a line up! And also there's a kitchen break from 4-5pm, mostly everyday."}
{"text":"We had the fried chicken (dak ball), bibimbap and supreme poutine and it was amazing! No wonder there is always a line up. Servers are also very friendly and fast. I would definitely recommend! :)"}
{"text":"Yummy! Recommended : Fried chicken and bulgogi ramen, lil spicy but not that much. Long lined but worth for waiting. Quick and good service."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place because there was a line out the door, always a good sign. Excellent choice! The ramen is straightforward, traditional, and delicious. Their kim-chee is terrific, so dishes that feature it are too. And there are surprises, like a simple but delicious (and plentiful) spicy tuna roll, and Korean soft drinks i had never tasted before. I went hungry and left happy"}
{"text":"Cute korean servers, up to date kpop songs, nice decor and not to mention the great food and service, GaNaDaRa has become one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal after my first visit. The food is tasty and the portion they give is enough to let you leave with more than a full stomach!"}
{"text":"Best bibimbap in town!! The service is great, people are exceptionally nice, food arrives fast, always taste great and prices are cheap. The only downfall is that the place is quite small and always full, be ready to wait a bit outside , it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food but the place is tiny and most of the time you end up waiting in a lineup for your turn to sit. The TV there causes unnecesaray distraction hard to keep up a conversation with the person you came with.  They have 1 tiny ugly bathroom that had no paper last time. Also, for some reason I prefer their menu before they had their renovations done. If it was only for the food I would of given this place 5 stars"}
{"text":"The first time we came here, it was more out of curiosity to be honest. We had past this place a couple of times, and wondered why there was always a line. So glad we decided to be \"followers\" lol. We were happily surprised by the prices, so were able to order a few dishes to try and share. I don't remember all the names, so I won't be helpful in that regards. I do know my boyfriend got the dakbal dish and he really, really enjoyed it. We also got the seafood pancake (yum!), beef ramen (for the bf), a fried seafood & rice dish, and the sushi. Everything was delicious and filling! The second time I came, my boyfriend and his friend got rice dishes, and I had the sushi again with the vegetable dumplings. Those were gooood. Of course the wait isn't the best thing ever, but just come when you aren't at the \"starving, need to eat something now\" point lol - I've learnt my lesson!"}
{"text":"I love ganadara and I live right next to it. IT's great Korean komfort food. I always get the kimchijeon and the rappoki, without a doubt. All their food is great but those are 2 things I could not live without"}
{"text":"So good! The place was packed but the wait was short and the meals came out quickly! I eat Korean in NYC often but this was better than anything I've had south of Montreal... Our plates looked locked-clean when we were finished!"}
{"text":"Food was good but we waited 45 mins for a table (which is ok). But then when 3 over 5 of us showed up, we were still ordering food. Then 1 waiter came and asked us that \"we thought everyone's gonna be here at 6\". When it was only 6:20. I know that the place gets crowded but we never thought that someone would come to us and ask us rudely like that (he wants us to finish early ?) we just sat 20 mins there. I love this place but never i'll come back again. So disappointing with the attitude."}
{"text":"The food is so expensive and taste nasty!!! Dont know why so many people go there! The food is so little and salty, hate it!"}
{"text":"This is a enjoyable place to eat,They have an all you can eat buffet, the staff is easily reached and the place is in incline toward of fact tidy.Their prices are cheaper for lunch,than short food restaurants.When you depart there you can proclaim, you got your maintenance's worth.Its a favorite when my relatives."}
{"text":"Excellent if you like spicy! The inside of the place is amazing, food is great for the price and the staff super friendly. Def worth the lineup"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is so delicious that I went 2 days in a row because clearly one bibimbap just isn't enough.     GaNaDaRa is only about a 3 minute walk from Guy-Cocordia metro, but I never would have spotted it if it hadn't been for a friend inviting me to join her.  I have a huge soft spot for Korean food and an even softer spot for bibimbap so when she said it was affordable and close by I was in!   The bibimbap was so very fresh and tasty and the sauce it came with was magical.  It added such a delicious combination of spice, texture and tang.  mwah! (*kisses 5 fingers and then opens hand up to the heavens)  The staff was quick and kind even though the place was packed.   The bulgogi and spicy ramyuns were so heartwarming that  I instantly imagined coming here on fall afternoons.    All in all 5, maybe 6 stars.  There's nothing not to love.  and they love you back.  There's some writing on the wall behind the cash that tells you so."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of hype in the neighbourhood and you always see up to a dozen people lined up outside waiting to go in, in all weather conditions. That's a huge bummer but the inside is very nice - a very urban Korean eatery where they cycle kpop MVs on the big tv. Their cheese topokki is really really good but may be better if you order a spicier version. I had their dolsot bibimbap, topokki, yogurt soju, and seafood pajeon with friends.  To me as a vancouver kid, it's not #1 but it's definitely very tasty and may be one of the top Korean comfort food restaurants in Montreal. Go try it!"}
{"text":"Excellent. The food is always delicious and fresh. The service is fast and the staff is nice. Very reasonable prices and the portions are big. I couldn't recommend this place more."}
{"text":"A really really Good Korean spot to grab something to eat. It is also very affordable, service is fast and friendly. Nonetheless, be ready to wait , usually packed in this 30 seats restaurants.  Anyway , we started with the Korean crepe , which was oily, but tastes excellent and crispy.  Then, we went through our kimchi kimbab , hand down the best kimbab in Montreal  I've gotten since Vancouver ..  Last and not least , we got the Korean poutine , which is a poutine based with rice cakes and kimchi --tasty and spicy it is indeed very different from the regular poutine . One can get tired of this dish pretty easily thou ! It should still fill one to two person easily ."}
{"text":"The food is so good that you may have to unbutton your pants! Sometimes the soups can be on the salty side. Excellent flavor and good size portions."}
{"text":"My favorite Korean restaurant in Montreal! Some of the best bulgogi and pajeon that I have ever had. The food and service was excellent, but I noticed that the lunch menu is noticeably cheaper than during the evening."}
{"text":"Visited Montreal for the first time last summer in July and I've honestly been thinking about this spot ever since. As someone who loves Korean food, GaNaDara is pretty up there in my opinion in terms of delicious Korean food. It is a fairly small restaurant so be prepared to wait as the line can go out the door. The servers were pretty nice despite the rush. During my trip my friends and I went there twice in which we ordered the bibimbap, tofu soup, poutine fries, and rice cakes just to name a few. Next time I'm back in Montreal I'm planning on making a trip back."}
{"text":"Small restaurant - amazing food! It's a tiny place, with lovely quotes and decorations on the wall. Not much space to move around but good enough. If you go in a group of 4 and more, be prepared to wait for around 5 - 10 mins for a table. If you're less than 4, then you'll be fine.   The dishes are pretty delicious for such a cheap price - around 7$ for each plate! (I was shocked when it came time to pay for the bill.) The service was nice - although some servers don't speak French.  4 stars for a nice restaurant at such a cheap price!"}
{"text":"Can I just say that this is the most adorable place ever?? Such a throwback to my childhood days in Korea - great food, atmosphere and service!  We came in for a late lunch around 2pm and even though we were a party of 5, got seats right away. I've heard that this place was recently renovated and it looks really great. Super clean, sleek and modern.  As for the food, we were really hungry and ordered a lottt of dishes. We got the boulettes de dak and tokochi for starters. Oh my goodness, these were so good. The sauce was definitely key - so authentic, sweet and spicy. And the tokochi are warm and crispy so make sure to have them right away!  For the main dishes we got bulgogi soondubu jjigae, ramyun au bulgogi, bibimbap, tobboki with umouk tang, and tonkatsu au curry. The tonkatsu was mine and it was crispy on the outside, covered with mushroom curry sauce, and the pork inside was juicy and soft. Bibimbap is a safe choice and good for those that want a variety of veggies. My brother had the bulgogi items and I personally don't think they went well with either of the soups perhaps because bulgogi is traditionally a sweet meat dish. My sister had the tobboki with a umouk tang. This is totally recommended if you want the spicy regular spicy tobboki but need a little soup to take the edge off (It comes in a cup and with a pick to get the fish cake at the bottom).   Only disappointment, we really wanted to try the Pa Dak (which is Korean fried chicken with thin sliced scallions... trust me, it's to die for) but it's only available on their dinner menu so plan accordingly.  This place was absolutely great, perfect for family and kids, even if it's just for a quick bite. Prices are very reasonable as are portion sizes (understandably we took a part of our meal home with us). Service is efficient and kind. So glad we got to come in when we did because I hear the line gets long and people have to make an effort to get in. Wish there was one in the U.S. too!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is alright, but when I think about all the better Korean restaurants....... Ok let me put it this way:  On a scale of \"ethnic koreans\" to \"any other ethnicity you'll see here\", this place gets a rating of \"I'm racist\"/10  Let's settle for Yelp's 1/5."}
{"text":"The quality of food was good and you have multiple options to select yet there is a line up before you get seated. And waitress are super busy I think they should hire more waitresses."}
{"text":"Dukbokki was good but just like any other so I wouldn't say it was particularly worth the 30 min plus wait. However if you are there, the fried chicken dish is really good! I ordered it expecting it to be like karage and was originally sad it wasn't, but it actually is a quite lightly battered yet still crunchy version of Chinese style sweet and sour pork!"}
{"text":"Really good, the food was really authentic and I was craving korean food for a long time, and this restaurant delivered it. I'll come back for sure.   Only one little thing, the place is a little bit too small. I feel like on a Saturday night j won't be able to eat there.  But it's awesome"}
{"text":"Really nice for cheap korean snack food!  Good prices, good service, well prepared food. If you want to test the waters with korean food, GaNaDaRa has a good selection to choose from"}
{"text":"It's been around 2 weeks since they've reopened (closed for renovations for March and April) and the line here is still super long! Came here with 2 friends for dinner around 6, and waited ~35 minutes to get seated.   The interior is kinda small, and I think their seating makes it a bit cramped. There are a lot of tables with 2 seats, but only a couple tables with 4 seats, so if you don't want to wait long, I'd recommend coming here when they open, or coming here with just another person!  My friends and I decided to share everything, and we ordered the dubboki tsunami (I may have butchered the spelling), the tofu dolsot bibimbap, and the curry tonkatsu.   The tofu dolsot bibimbap was pretty good, and included tofu (obviously), shredded carrots, mushrooms, cucumbers, bean sprouts, and chickpeas! It was pretty good, but I found the rice to be a bit flavourless.  The dubboki tsunami came with dubboki, ramen, fried kimbap, fish cake, deep fried veggies, deep fried mushrooms, and hard boiled eggs. I really enjoyed the deep fried mushrooms in this dish - they were super juicy. The dish overall was very good, but I think there were too many fried things in this dish (fried kimbap sounded good, but was a bit too much for me)  I really enjoyed the curry sauce in the curry tonkatsu, and the tonkatsu was pretty tender as well!   Overall, I'd say ganadara is a pretty good bet for good Korean food in downtown Montreal, and definitely worth a visit !"}
{"text":"Amazing food for great prices.  You know the place is good when there is a half block lineup outside! My Korean friends love it too which says a lot!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by my friend Jonathan who happened to be friends with the owner and safe to say, this place is the real deal. There was a line when I got there but it was worth the wait. If I had to recommend something it would be to order the set and sour chicken they have there. It's amazing and one of the best I've eaten all-time!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a great style and is very light. It's kind of small though.   I tried the Kimchi Jeon. I ordered it vegetarian (no pork). It was very good and the soy sauce was very flavorful. It was slightly on the greasy side and just slightly undercooked in some places but otherwise it was great.  Overall a great meal for an even better price."}
{"text":"Un de mes restos coréens préférés. Le service est rapide et très chaleureux. La nourriture est très bonne et la gamme de prix est excellente, parfaite pour des étudiants qui ont un budget à respecter. Le restaurant est petit, donc durant les weekends il est souvent plein et il faut prévoir un 10 minutes d'attente dehors."}
{"text":"Everyday on my way to Guy Concordia metro for the past 1 year, I had watched people waiting in queue outside the restaurant, braving hot sun, heavy rains and harsh winter just to enjoy their food. I had no time or too lazy to wait outside to visit this wonderful restaurant. Well, today I had waited in line for half n hour and had a conversation with a fellow foodie, who is a regular to the restaurant and he's got only good things to say about the restaurant. The waiters were pretty, friendly and fast. I could not remember the names of the items I ordered, mostly they were bimbap, bibimbap. The food I ordered was really good with the spicy chicken and the perfectly sliced vegetables that are really good. I want to know were they got their knifes from. If you are good at using chopsticks unlike me, you can try the ramen. They had the korean beer and vodka, which I will try next time. This restaurant is ideal for 2, 3 or 4 people. If you are planning date that involves wine and calm atmosphere, this ain't your place.The ambience and energy of the restaurant is good as mostly the youth from both the universities eat here. The bill do not burn a hole in your pocket and you will return next time, I guarantee that...."}
{"text":"Coming from Toronto, there is definitely a larger selection of restaurants, but this is one of the best Korean spots in Montreal.  Really unique dishes, especially since they updated their menu. They have some flavourful Korean fusion dishes (careful- some are spicy!).   The downsides are the long line (unavoidable), the crowded setting and the fact that there aren't many side dishes."}
{"text":"I have been here for many times and never get enough of it ?Actually l am not a big fan of poutine,but their poutine is great and the price is reasonable?It's worth to try it?Trust me"}
{"text":"This place is so good. Food hits the spot each time. I get the soondubu jjigae which is this spicy tofu soup and it's the best thing ever on a cold day though I get double the runny nose - one from outside and one from the spiciness. The dak ball is so great for sharing but I could probably eat it as a meal too. It's a pretty small space so I'd recommend getting there early/not going at prime meal hours unless you're down for waiting"}
{"text":"This place has the best korean food I've ever had in Montreal. Didn't know korean food could taste this good until I tried it out. The price is very reasonable and affordable, you can easily get yourself a fulfilling meal within 15$. There's always a huge lineup for this place, so be prepared for that."}
{"text":"if you're eating Asian food , but you're not eating it at GaNaDara, you're fucking around"}
{"text":"I have tried a lot of korean restaurants. I must admit that they made a good quality of foods. Worth walking for 30mins from my hotel. I ordered bibimbab, ramyun bulgolgi, and gyoza. They're excellent!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came to visit Montreal over Labor Day weekend coming from the U.S. and was craving for some ramen. We found this little Korean restaurant on yelp and wanted to give it a try.   Here's my story on their service.  My cousin and his girlfriend (which are both from the U.S. As well arrived there first and grabbed us a table since we were running behind since our hotel was a bit further away. The waitress was very kind and let them reserve a table while waiting for our arrival.   We finally arrived and parked in the parking lot right next to the restaurant (which wasn't free). All I had on me was larger CAD $20 to pay for the parking machine when all I needed was CAD $7. I asked our waitress if it was possible to give us some change and she gladly helped. Thumbs up on great service.   Now the review that people really care about.. Their food and beverage. I had the bulgogi ramyun and Korean Soda with milk flavor. The ramyun was delicious. Good portions of ramen noodles and meat. Enough to make you full and not making you leave feeling like a fat kid. The soda was okay. It was my first time trying it.   Overall, everyone in my party enjoyed their meal. The environment was great as well with a younger crowd and also families.   Ill definitely come back here whenever we are back in Canada."}
{"text":"So far my favorite Korean spot in downtown Montreal ! Food are simple , freaky delicious and cheap! Love the Korean food with American twist! The cons: space is small and there is always too many people! After 5pm this place is packed like in an stadium. But the service is great and fast!"}
{"text":"Nice! The service was much better this time! Orders were taken really fast and food came out quickly.  The dishes are seasoned nicely and the Dolsot Bibimbap was sizzling hot and mouth-watering. It is not really seasoned so you'll need the Gochujang to make it shine, they give you a whole bottle so dig in!  The Ramyun was pretty mediocre, nothing too outstanding. The Chamchi Kimbap, on the other hand, was outstanding. I especially liked the toasted sesame seed on top of every piece, it contrasts the texture quite nicely as well as complementing the dish. The only downside is that I tasted canned tuna, which was disappointing.  I guess there are certain dishes not to order in this place, because they are prepared with less care and given less attention. My advice is go for the Bibimbap, as well as any other rice dishes, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yep.....you have a short wait, but so worth it.  Food is delicious, it's served fast and priced right.  The place has really good vibe and people are enjoying themselves.  So yummy -"}
{"text":"wow. although it technically serves korean \"food\", this place is no better than most of the other disgusting greasy spoon general tso-serving (meaning they serve fake chinese/japanese/korean/asian food) vomitoriums in montreal. i'm overwhelmed with disappointment, but the words flashing in my brain right now are: loud, greasy, flavorless (unless you consider capsaisin flavor), watery, gristle, mystery meat, cafeteria-styling... confused waitstaff.  if you have more than $10 in your pocket, tastebuds, more than one functioning neural cell in your cranium, and value your intestinal health then go somewhere else. if you have ever tasted real traditional korean food, or even decent korean fast food, or even decent food of any sort - then avoid severe disappointment and stomach pain by going somewhere else.  enjoying a meal in a restaurant in montreal is not a difficult task - this city has a plethora of excellent restaurants. GaNaDaRa isn't the absolute worst in town but it is close to it.   this is why i cannot understand why people eat here. even students. i know they have no cash flow, are unmotivated to drag their feet a few blocks away from the classroom or dorm so that they could visit better restaurants up the hill, and they don't know what good food tastes like (yet). but why they would voluntarily torture their insides at GaNaRaDa is beyond me. maybe they're distracted by hormones or math. maybe responding to a dare. i only mention it because the few times i attempted to put \"food\" in my mouth hole at GaNaDaRa, i noticed that the place was filled with glassy-eyed students with bowl-cut hairdos wearing their backpacks while they ate their \"meals\". maybe they knew better and kept the packs on b/c they expected a quick run to the bathroom... ?"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing !!!! And cheap !!! The sevice is very fast... you go in and your done in 30-40 min max. There is always a line up thiugh so come prepared to wait !"}
{"text":"I was expecting this place to be the top and the best, since trip advisor was occurred. It's easier to get a table for 2 instead a table of group. They have more tables for 2 meanwhile they only have like 5 tables for groups. On my first time visit, i had three people and waited for 30 minutes. I came all the way here for the poutine. which I was a bit skeptical about the taste because in the reviews most said it was good, but the first three bites it was alright but then it was sweet.  We had the chicken balls, but I wasn't really a fan of it.. It kinda just taste like sesame chicken to me. Sorry. I also had the fried veggie and seafood bibimbap it was alright , and filling.   Overall I think this trip was a little disappointment :( I wish they had better superior sauce for their bibimbaps."}
{"text":"I went back tonight with my boyfriend. We ordered fried pork Kim bab, their traditional fried chicken, bbq squid and two hot bowls; beef&veggies on top of rice. I have to say that this time was amazing compared to the first time I came with my mom. It definitely changed my views on this place! The waitress was nice and helpful and she served the hot sauce on the side so my meal didn't come SUPPER spicy like last time when the waiter didn't even ask how spicy we can handle. We ate like kings, finished everything and the bill was just 45$! The wait was around 45 mins but totally worth it this time. The environment was cool like last time just a lil small and noisy, but the tv was playing hypnotizing Korean music vids which was cool. Oh and I was super full at the end of everything :) can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Delicious Korean food! It's as authentic as it gets! The price was very reasonable for the amount of food we got. I tried the beef bulgogi on rice and it was good. The beef could have had more flavour to it. But this place is a great Korean restaurant to go to!!"}
{"text":"OMG. Simply outstanding. Innovative cuisine combined with high quality ingredients and generous portions makes this place a \"must\" for anyone who enjoys Korean/Asian food. I can't pronounce or spell anything I had so you'll just have to trust me - everything I had was so good.  The waitress stopped me from over-ordering (also a good sign of great service).  If you don't know what to have, ask the wait staff. They selected a nice combo and I left stuffed!  I will be back with friends and family in tow. GoHereNow."}
{"text":"A new, bustling, cute restaurant downtown, Ganadara does not disappont!  We walked in here simply because of how packed it was (on a Monday night close to 10pm) and were seated at lightening speed. The menu is extensive and we ended up ordering several items to share including their 'sushi' roll, friend chicken bites, bulgogi, and another meat dish I can't remember. Our food was either amazing or bland but the many flavors presented were appreciated.  The waiters were very quick and helpful. It's been a while since I've seen school great service!  Overall a really nice place. We will definitely be back to try more items (and get the bulgogi again because it was so good)"}
{"text":"Very good food.   Some of the best I have had anywhere.   Very good prices.  For our trip to Montreal this was some of the best we had there.  We were able to get a table when we arrived but soon after that they started to line up.   The food comes out fast and they move the people through as well."}
{"text":"We were a group of 2, and although there was a line out front of the restaurant we were seated within 10 minutes which is amazing! All the servers are very nice. Had the bibimbop ramen and the dak ball, both were absolutely delicious! I've never had ramen as good as the one here and the dak ball is the best Korean fried chicken out there would recommend this chicken if you go!!! My friend had the chicken cheese satu and it was amazing as well! The prices are great from the portions, and the inside of the restaurant is so cute! I really love this place and am very excited to return!"}
{"text":"Un petit restaurant récemment rénové (avril 2015). Toujours rempli. Le menu est simple, mais très satisfaisant. Nous y allons de temps en temps, lorsqu'il n'y a pas de file d'attente.   La crêpe aux fruits de mer en vaut le détour. Les ramens sont ok. Les prix sont très abordables. À essayer!"}
{"text":"Yummy!   A perfect little dish of kimchees started lunch, its tangyness making sure that I was ready for a hearty meal.  Then I had the Pork Tonkatsu - a dish of beautifully deep-fried breaded pork served alongside a mound of rice and shredded cabbage. I'm not one to wax poetic about cabbage but I'll make an exception this time. I mixed the crispy veg and its sauce with the rice and discovered a whole new taste experience! The toothsome cabbage blended with sticky rice was a perfect counterpoint to the crunchiness of the pork and the satisfying squish of the mozzarella cheese that oozed unctuously from between the slices. OMG So good!  For desert... No room for desert. I couldn't even finish my plate so at $12 my meal was value for money.  The small resto is cozy, and was jam packed with millennials. The buzz of conversations was comfortable and gave the place a friendly homey vibe. If you dine alone on a -25C day, make sure to grab a spot at the mirrored bar. The radiator below keeps your feet and belly warm. The food makes your belly a happy one.  Service was friendly, prompt and efficient. Can't ask for more than that!"}
{"text":"Student-friendly Korean fusion place. I think fusion is a keyword to keep in mind when trying out this place because their items are NOT authentic but I like how they experimented with traditional Korean dishes and most of them tasted great!  We ordered an appetizer of grilled fish which I absolutely devoured. The fish had bones but they are negligible. As an Asian, I feel that fish with bones have more intact flavours so loved it! Then we ordered Korean Poutine (sounds rather strange right?) and the Tsunami Ramyun. The Ramyun was a fun dish, so many textures and flavors packed into this one plate. There were korean sushi rolls, this thing called udoki, ramen, egg (loved that egg extension) and then there were fish cakes and tempura. Great choice if you want to sample everything little by little. The poutine had fries and udoki with a kind of ramen sauce.   This place is definitely a playful change for your taste buds. The ambiance is casual and the food items  are creative. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"Great tasty food if you like asian fusion. And even if you're not a huge fan like me, try it!  The staff are so patient and helpful, I called to pick up an order really close to closing time and the lady explained every single thing I asked about without rushing me at all. And then she invited me to come in so that she would explain some more! I'm glad I did because I really didn't expect the place to look so clean and modern! It was a pleasant surprise.  There's usually a line outside that's why I was tempted to try it and I'm glad I did. Everything was tasty, even the famous \"seafood pancake\" which I was a bit skeptical about. The portions are so big but why not? Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"After an evening flight in Montreal, this place was still open when I wandered around for dinner. So thats a plus. Definitely lots of young college students coming here as the restaurant still had a line at 10 PM. I didn't like that the servers just let you gather at the vestibule until there's an empty table, but they were nice and friendly. The menu is interesting to say the least, but I was playing it safe with a tofu dolsot bbb. I didn't expect the tofu to be fried but that was a nice touch, I think all tofu bbb should be like that. Not so cool that as I was scarfing down some greasy ass food the only entertainment choice was kpop video."}
{"text":"Although we had to wait half an hour on a sunday night, it was definitely worth it to be honest. The service was excellent, and we didn't wait that long for the food. The kimbap was sooooo delicious, will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Used to come here 2-3 times a week until it renovated and became more popular. The price is a bit higher now and it's always so crowded that i don't feel like waiting. It's better to get take out.   One of my fave food is the spicy tuna kimbap and the gigantic poutine, filled with a chicken, bulgogi and seafood."}
{"text":"In the city of Montreal, this is my favourite Korean restaurant. The price is average for the food, but the taste is there. I love kimchi and was disappointed that it didn't taste up to par. But everything else was yummy. I love the bbp. The environment is very cute. The only downside of this restaurant is the lineup. Go early."}
{"text":"I walked in, full of goodlooking people, everyone busy eating their dish....I really wanted to test their bibimbap as it is one of my favorite Korean dish....The waiter was friendly and humble, took my order gave served me with some yummy Kimchi...After waiting for couple of minutes the highly anticipated Bibimbap came infront of me, presentationwise it looked soooo beautiful, gave me some glitters in my eyes....but then i manned up and got started with it........as you might know or might not know, bibimbap comes with a special kind of sauce and if you push it on your dish it gives you double the pleasure....yea that sauce is really tasty damn it...then I raped the whole bowl like i usually do, mixed everything up as  bibimbap by definition means rice mixed with other stuff......The waiter served me another round of kimchi which was a plus...loved the hospitality....About the price, it is as cheap as it can get, Beef Bibimbap is only 11.50 including Tax....There were some other really cool dishes in GaNaDaRa that I would love to try out in the near future, one of them is tteokbokki, and yea you've guessed it right...the BULGOGI!"}
{"text":"Service rapide, très bonne cuisine \"fusion\", choix multiples, tout est parfait chez eux. J'y vais 2 à 3 fois par semaine."}
{"text":"I love the flavours at Ganadara- the food here is authentic Korean but the stars drop from my rating for the service given by disorganized young aged staff.  FOOD review: Out of 5 stars- I ordered the half portion of umouk as a starter**** - a Korean ssushi dish with 6 pieces stuffed with fried fishcakes, cabbage and mayo- very good and filling, advise to share  Tobboki Tsunami-*** It didn't occur to me that there was a spicy sign for this dish-I had to drink water between each bite- a cool concept of rappoki (rice cakes) and ramen with   boiled egg, tempura styled veggies and sushi. Big meal for 12.50$   SERVICE review :  This is a student joint so I don't expect much.  Closely located near the Guy-Concordia metro - st. Mathieu exit- expect a good 20 min line up outside of the restaurant. The space is small but cute. With simple deco - with constant K pop videos streaming on screen.   I was placed at a 4 seater table then moved to a 2 seater. Given I was under a time constraint, I ordered my food to go. I figured I could still eat in until my time of departure. The waitress told me to go pay to save time as the food would take 15 mins to prepare. I was charged for the wrong order 2x- it seemed like they had no way of keeping track of the orders - playing tetris with the bills on the counter top whenever someone left.   Finally after returning to my table- I see my water and utensils have been cleared off! I asked another waitress if I could have my water back - she goes ok but you have to sit in that chair (pointing to a detention like seat next to the bathroom for take out customers). I refused to sit and instead stood there drinking my water laughing in my head...   This staff  is clueless of managing a fast food joint- literally no way of keeping  track of customers -more like overwhelmed mice running around. I blame the management - who should take the time to train their staff - at the end service is just as important as quality of food!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Try the bulgogi dupbap (seasoned beef with rice) or dak balls (fried chicken) for a delicious meal! The service has always been great when I've been here. Even when they asked me to switch tables to accommodate a bigger group (which I didn't mind at all) they gave me a drink on the house! Plus you can watch K-pop music videos while you eat. Just be prepared to wait 15-20 minutes on a weekend night for a table. It's a popular place."}
{"text":"Great food. I've been there multiple times and the food has been consistent. Would definitely recommend, although it gets quite packed and a bit tight in there."}
{"text":"This place is small, cute, and gets packed pretty easily. The captions on the wall are cheesy, but they're cheesy in a hilarious way so it's bearable. Many people have mentioned how Ganadara doesn't seem to have a heating system, but I felt fine. The only time I felt cold was when someone came in or out and let cold air in. The restaurant was not jamming K-Pop on loud either, but it was playing quietly on their TV.  More importantly, the food was great. I ordered the Bulgogi Ramyun, my friend ordered the Bibimbap in a stone bowl, and we shared a rather large and greasy appetizer- their Kimchi Pancake. While we waited for our dishes, we were served a small bowl of kimchi and radish.   The food was so good, I was pleased with my order and slurped it right up. They put a generous portion of beef, and the broth was delicious. I asked for it to be a little spicier too for a greater kick. In my opinion, definitely one of their best dishes. I like their more personal touch: serving it up in a small cooking pot. I had a few bites of my friend's Bibimbap, which I found came out a close 2nd, but nothing could beat my ramyun- hands down! I liked the pancake as well, however it was just too greasy for me to consider ordering it again anytime soon.   I'm glad this area is booming with some good quality food and hole in the walls!"}
{"text":"Little bit bland food wise, good value for money hole in the wall place"}
{"text":"I've being to this place more times than I can remember and I loved the food every single time! The dish I ordered the most is their Tobboki Tsunami, it has pretty much everything in it: Ramen, tempura, kimbap, an egg and even a fried gyoza. The spicyness is right on point for me althought I realise it might be a bit spicy for people who don't eat spicy food a lot. Their kimbaps are quite simple yet very tasty. The service is really good and the food usual comes in a fair amount of time even when the place is full with 20 people outside waiting in the cold :)  The only negative thing I can come up with is that I wish they could expand the place. I mean don't you hate it when you gotta wait 20 minutes when it's -100 outside haha."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and definitely won't be my last! The service was great; the waiters were very attentive and enthusiastic. The ambiance along with the K-pop music gives the restaurant a very modern and trendy vibe.   I ordered the tonkatsu rice dish and would highly recommend it to anyone unsure of what to order. Overall, an amazing experience and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place has a line ! But it moves pretty fast. It was two of us and we ordered the Dolsot Bimbimbap, the Tonkatsu kimbap and the fried chicken. They were all delicious ! Portions are bigger than average. Very young and hip place to eat. Service is fast and everyone is very nice. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Great food, great prices, and great atmosphere. It's a pain to have to wait in a lineup outside, most of the time, but now I just place my order in advance by phone and grab it to-go. I'll never get tired of their bibimbaps. Also, try the Dak balls. It's a Korean take on general tao chicken, but FARRRR better."}
{"text":"very nice place!! not much aesthetic appeal from the outside and very hard to spot..as it has no name and is adjacent to a laundromat but is a little gem on a busy street !! everything we tried was amazing. I recommend the ramyun noodles and chicken Katsu, the price is very good $10-$15 max for large portions plus has a cool vibe with k-pop music playing in the background, BEWARE of rush hour, huge lineups outside the restaurant and wait time can be long."}
{"text":"GaNaDaRa is love. I've heard so much from Korean friends about this place, so I was so excited to make this visit. There's nothing sadder than non-authentic Korean food. GaNaDaRa did not disappoint me.  I'm giving them a 5-star for food because it is SO good. I've tried the cheese toppoki, poutine toppoki, vegetable bibimbap, and sundubu jjigae. The poutine toppoki was something I never would've ordered (and I didn't, my dad did), but ended up blowing my mind. It is indeed the sinful love child of Korean food and Montreal food. Every dish they served had such rich yet comforting flavor, making me miss Asia so much. My usual order is the vegetable bibimbap because I'm vegetarian. The waiters are always so mindful because they always ask me if I'm okay with egg on top, which not many waiters do (though they really should).   The one thing I have a negative impression of is the service. The waiters and waitresses are super friendly and helpful when it comes to giving recommendations and taking orders, but I really think they could make small changes here and there to make their service more efficient. At peak hours, there's a huge line outside (I once lined up for 30-40 minutes for a seat). For now, I recommend going a little earlier so you don't have to wait for too long or to order take-out, but hopefully they'll switch things up in the long-term.   Aah I miss their food already!"}
{"text":"Pretty good cheap Korean food. I liked the ramyun soup and dak balls."}
{"text":"Good food and good service.   I ordered the Bulgogi Dolsot Bimbimbap, and it was really good. I especially liked the lotus root! I've never seen it in a dish like this before, but I loved the taste of it.  Would totally recommend it but it seems that there's usually a really long line."}
{"text":"Je suis allée pour la première fois récemment avec un cousin qui a vécu 1 an  en Corée L'ambiance est très \"fast food\", musique forte et éclairage night-life. On a commencé par une entrée de tokochi qui était noyé dans une sauce trop vinaigrée. On nous à emmener du kimchi fait avec du chou vert pas fermenté mais qui avait bon goût. Mon plat principal était une escalope de poulet pané (tonkatsu) qui était généreuse, croustillante et délicieuse. La sauce aussi était bonne. Seul point négatif sur la salade de maïs qui avait beaucoup trop de mayo. J'ai goûté au bulgogi ramyun de mon cousin qui était bien mais sans plus. Le bouillon un peu trop salé mais goûteux, le bulgogi excellent mais les nouilles sont comme celles des sachets. Une expérience en dents de scie tout de même agréable mais sans plus. Je n'attendrais pas dehors pour ça."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Perfect food portions for a very good price, staff members are super nice, polite and friendly and the service is impeccable. Delicious food! Will recommend and go back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good! Got the ddukbokki poutine and the bulgolgi dubab! Only thing I'll say is the bulgolgi was a tad salty but so worth it!"}
{"text":"GO THERE EARLY. The line as this place is crazy. We went there at 5:00 and it was almost full. And the line formed right after we got there.   But it's worth it. The food is good. Look at the menu but don't forget to look at the board on the wall. There are some things there that are not on the menu.  Only disappointment was the kimchi. It did not taste great. If felt as if it had not been fermented at all. It was extremely crunchy.  For the decor, I don't care about it. It's a bit of a student place. Important part is food is good and prices are good. If you are downtown and feel like eating korean this is a really good place... If you are willing to wait."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service, massive portions for the price. Expect to queue, but it moves along fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Very confused as to what you montrealers consider good but this is just another place that disappointed me during my visit. The place was way too tiny (the size of most restaurants washrooms).. everything tasted the same. The fried tofu shouldve been cut smaller so that it could be all around crunchy rather than have a thin crispy layer that became soft before it got to me. The woman kept playing the same pathetic rap song in which they rapped in french. Such a joke. Boy am I glad to be back in Toronto"}
{"text":"I hate waiting in line but every time I go.. at least 30min wait time. But it's worth the wait! The price is good for what they sell. The tastes is great! Their service is also great! Certain dishes portion are big. Usually I order about 4 to 5 dishes for two ppl but always have left over and the bill is about $60 with tax and tip. I recommend to everyone who wants to try korean food cheap but this is not luxury korean food. What they sell is more of street/somewhat fast food."}
{"text":"So authentic, so good. The Tofu Soup with Bulgogi was hands down one of the best I have ever tasted.  Just fyi, the wait was over 40 minutes even on a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"Best Korean restaurant in Montreal!! My friends and I love here so much. Staff are friendly and the food is simply awesome. All the foods are very nice, especially the spicy chicken wings, which was recommended by the staff there!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Had the Dolsot bibimbap with tofu and an added egg and it was delicious, perfect for the -15C weather. The tofu was delicious (crispy on the outside and silky on the inside), the egg was perfectly fried, and the rice was amazing. Happily finished the entire thing. My friend had a Jjigae (think it was the kimchi one) which she said was delicious too. The service was super friendly (the waitresses seemed genuinely really nice) and so fast!"}
{"text":"Speedy service and great food. The dolsot bibimbap reminded me of what I used to eat in Korea!"}
{"text":"Amazing place, food is delicious! Try to arrive close to opening hours so you don't wait in line too much. Went there a couple of times with friends and never was unsatisfied! They also had a contest on their instagram page to win a free meal which i think is fun. A place to go! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Une de mes valeurs sûres pour la saveurs de ses plats et son coût abordable. Le personnel est toujours accueillant et sympathique et le service est rapide. L'endroit est bruyant un peu mais ça fait partie du charme de la place. Attendez-vous à attendre un peu dehors le soir, le restaurant devient de plus en plus connu. Arrivez vers 4:45 (la cuisine ferme de 4 à 5) si vous détestez les files d'attente, sinon ce n'est jamais plus de 15-20 minutes. La nourriture est diversifié et savoureuse. Prévoyez 3-8$ par entrée et 8$ à 13$ par plat principal en moyenne.   Les plats sont souvent épicés, soyez-en averti! Une entrée et un plat principal sont suffisant pour combler la plupart des mangeur puisque les portions sont intéressantes. Ne vous attendez pas à de la haute cuisine, mais c'est probablement l'un des rapports qualité prix valant le plus le détour à Montréal."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't understand the hype. I've lived across the street from this restaurant for about 1.5 years now. It has a line out the door, come snow, shine, rain and all. People can not get enough of this place and I simply don't understand why. I went here for a casual weeknight dinner with my partner on his birthday. As I only eat halal, we kept the meal on the pescatarian side. We order bibimbap, some fried things and a few other small plates. Nothing was really flavorful and we were definitely not full. A waste of $50 if you ask me."}
{"text":"New Korean restaurant in town! Yipee! Atmosphere is very cute, the walls are plastered with cutesy sketches of cats and such. The bathroom is even cute too (toilet seat cover has a drawing of a hiding bunny). Now food wasn't consistently delicious due to our overly sweet rice cake appetizer, but the mains my boyfriend and I had were the highlight of the night. We both ordered ramyun but different kinds. I ordered a spicy ramyun, while my bf had a rice cake ramyun. The broth was just amazing and perfect.   As for service. There was only one waiter, and he was quite attentive. Oh but one thing I'd like to add, they do not give a lot of side dishes like most Korean places. It's a must check out and expect a cozy restaurant.  I will definitely come back to try their rice dishes. Prices are also very cheap!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is simply amazing, the best Korean restaurant I have been to in Montreal and when I got the bill for 2, I laughed so hard because it was only 11$!!!!  Highly recommend they make really awesome ramen in a casserole with bulgogi beef!!!"}
{"text":"Ganadara is small, convenient and cozy! My friend and I couldn't get over the cute deco-art and chinglish sayings on the walls. We came for lunch and reading the reviews, I anticipated it to be very busy. Even though there was only 1 waitress, the service was pretty quick.  My friend ordered the seafood ramen, and I wanted to try something new- I took a chance with the toboki! Our meals came with these little boxes of pickled-vegetables, which weren't what I would describe as tasty, but a nice addition.   The ramen arrived, steaming in a small pot. Yes, the noodles are just like the ones from a package at Dollarama. Except with 4 clams on top. And a bit of garnish. There were a few baby shrimps in there, but really, the seafood ramen hadn't lived up to it's name.   On the other hand, the toboki was an exciting dish of hot, chewy rice rolls in a thick, salty and spicy sauce. I really liked my dish even if it made me feel a little queasy afterwards. I would definitely come back again to try some other items off the menu. The prices are student-budget friendly!"}
{"text":"This resto is cozy and very welcoming. The food is great plus affordable, deliciously filling. The service is good too. Gone there 3 days in a row since I couldn't get enough of their dukkboki & the ramyum one too!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place for Korean food at a reasonable price in the downtown area. I've tried a bunch of dishes, but my favorites are the fried chicken (Dak Tuikim), chili chicken (Dak Ball), and tuna kimbap (Chamchi Kimbap). The short ribs (Galbi) and dumplings (Mandu) are really delicious too! There are maybe 10 tables and counter-seating, but it feels really authentic of a small Seoul restaurant - complete with MNET playing on the flat-screen (that's one of the Korean music networks). It's really hot in the restaurant though, and if you're eating spicy food, you'll be sweating heavily. Plan accordingly and wear layers so you can semi-undress."}
{"text":"I've been to GaNaDaRa twice and have had very pleasant experiences both times.    Their tsunami tteokbokki was so incredible, I had it both times I was there. Next time I go, I'll try to switch it up because I'm sure the rest of their menu is great as well.  The only reason I'm just giving them 4 stars is that because it's so busy and because they only have a couple of servers on the floor at a time, the service is a bit slow.  They're very nice but it's difficult to get their attention sometimes."}
{"text":"Definitely a late night kind of restaurant in my opinion (especially since there's no line up later in the night). The staff is super kind and helpful, and to me the food is just very cheap for the size of the portions and the taste. Love"}
{"text":"Love love love LOVE this place. Their tteokbokki poutine with chicken (literally THE ultimate korean fusion meal) is my go-to. I have low tolerance for spicy food (I know, I know, for some of you, Ganadara is not spicy at all) but will power through because the food is just too good.  The wait time can be a bit long but you can always order for takeout!"}
{"text":"Tried several Korean restaurants in town, but this one is definitely my preferred! Not expensive and extremely good, friendly service that will help you choose your appetizers and mean course if you are not sure what to order, only \"issue\" is the long line-up outside that shall take you 15-45 minutes waiting and if it is a raining or cold day is a bit tough but it worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Don't let the line turn your back away from this, it's soooo worth the wait ( a little less in the winter time, but still)  Great portions for a good price. Tried to tokbokki poutine and it was soo good. Usually I stick with Bibibamp (nothing can ever go wrong with a bibibamp anyway)  Peep the pictures : we were only 2 and i think our eyes are bigger than our stomach  doesn't matter i would want to order everything off the menu anyway !"}
{"text":"It must be my favourite ramen place in Montreal. And anything I try on the menu my tongue is happy! The prices are very good; I always leave feeling satisfied! The place is small; friendly waiters and fast service. I just don't like the wait in the line up ."}
{"text":"DamYun ? Noodles with chicken was FABULOUS!!  Great spicy ramen soup.   Kimchee and Chicken curry with rice were also very good.   Go early, there is usually a line down the sidewalk.  Great service."}
{"text":"Yes, the reviews don't lie! Ganadara lives up to its expectation. Expect good tasting Korean fast food fare, its always packed.  Asians seem to enjoy eating there, as that seems to be the majority of its clientele but for those adventurous non-asians who dare step in, their taste buds will leave with a different level of flavor appreciation! I took my mom there to try it out and we ordered the dumplings, the Korean sushi rolls, and I had the bibimbap in sizzling stone pot (choose that because its better). If you have to eat at lunch or supper time expect a crowd and a lineup. Otherwise, try showing up when they open or time it properly so that you're the second wave for seating. The wait staff are very polite, courteous and quite attractive as well.  Worth going for sure. It's the best comfort food fix."}
{"text":"We waited outside for 30 minutes, not sure if it was worth the wait. I ordered a dubu bibimbap and a tsunami teokbokki (shared with 2 friends).   The bibimbap was just okay nothing really special, except for the huge tofu they serve on top. The outside is fried but the inside is soft and kinda cold...not sure if it is supposed to be that way... The portion is quite large though, I couldn't finish it.   The tsunami teokbokki has a bit of everything but I think I prefer the teokbokki poutine more than this one. The ramen in the tsunami teokbokki was partly undercook, you could see that the noodles were white in the middle.   Even though the food did not impress me, it was fun eating there, I think I will be back to try other stuffs on their menu."}
{"text":"Okay, yeah, the reviews did NOT lead me astray. This place is AMAZING. Amazing. I left, already thinking about what I would order next time.  There tends to be a line out the door, so plan accordingly. But it moves quickly.   Service was fantastic.  I really appreciated the menu. Enough options to give you some choice, without being completely overwhelming. I'm not that familiar with Korean food and felt totally comfortable ordering.   We started with the Dak Bal - awesome. The dolsot bibimbap with tofu was, I thought, a bit bland. But, I mean, so it required a lot of sauce. No big deal.  Anyway, definitely my new favorite place in this part of town."}
{"text":"Il y a quelques jours je suis allé avec una amie. Le service était bon. Les serveurs étaient aimables et passaient devant les tables pour s'assurer que tout se déroulait bien. L'ambiance était bonne aussi (musique, atmosphère...). Par contre, il y beaucoup de bruit, donc si vous n'aimez pas ça, je vous le déconseille comme endroit. Toutefois, la nourriture était bonne et les prix n'étaient pas mal du tout.  ***CONSEIL: prévoyez être là 15 minutes avant l'ouverture, car il y a une file qui se forme rapidement.***"}
{"text":"Being allergic to queuing up to dine as rule, I was resistant to trying out this extremely popular Korean restaurant in the neighborhood I called home for three years. It was only once I moved all the way across the mount that I got to discover this gem of a restaurant. The memory of the deliciousness keeps you warm company while you're waiting for a table. Obviously, the larger the party, the longer the wait (which means that it usually isn't all that long for a table for two).  Would not be able to name every dish I tried that was a success, but the fried chicken bowl they offer as an appetizer is simply fantastic.  Portions are quite generous and prices, kind :) Their mild is not so mild is one thing I remember when I order.  I definitely recommend if you have some time to kill. If you don't, get over yourself, get in line and get ready for some good Korean food ;)"}
{"text":"I am so sad to give Ganadara a 2.5/5. After the renovation the consistency of the food has been a disappointment. I come to ganadara at least once every two weeks and I've tried almost everything on their menu.   The poutine (favorite of mine), the portion is smaller, the sauce isnt as spicy, the sauce is runny, bland and boiled cabbage is added (which i think is one of the reasons why its bland). I found out the chef prepares it differently. Instead of reheating the sauce for every order, it is put in a slowcooker and poured on the fries when ordered. Meaning the sauce doesnt have time to thicken up making its so runny that the fries get soggy a lot quicker.  The cheese bimbimbap was bland and the cheese made it oily and hard to eat.   The ramen is no longer served in the sizzling pot which is fine but the soup isn't boiling hot anymore (which i loved on a winter day). The broth isnt as spicy and flavourful.   The sushis, i really appreciate the half portions because I always want to try all of them but it ends up being too much.   After the renovations the portions were smaller and prices went up by a dollar (doesnt seem much but a dollar to everything adds up). Overall I would recommend it but being a long time customer, I am disappointed in the food Ganadara's been serving."}
{"text":"I've lived in several large cities on the East Coast of the U.S., including New York City, and I've never had Korean food as good as this.  I knew this place was legit the moment I walked in and realized that 80% of the people eating lunch were Korean.  I lucked out randomly picking Gandara  on Yelp while i was driving through Montreal on my way to a ski resort.  I thought about the chicken dak balls for the rest of my vacation. Great, now i'm getting hungry thinking about them again..."}
{"text":"We found out about this place from Yelp and decided to try it for the first time. We walked by this restaurant at about 9pm on a Tues and there was a line-up outside the door to be seated for dinner. We didn't want to wait in line, so we decided to just get take-out. We ordered the Tobokki poutine and the Rapokki. The Tobokki poutine did not taste as good as I had expected - it didn't have much flavour (other than spicy) and the fish cakes were very salty. However, the poutine was a big portion for $7-$8 and enough for 2 to share. The Rapokki was better, but nothing too special about it. We are from Toronto and I feel that the korean restaurants in our Yonge & Finch area are much better. Ganadara is a good and inexpensive place to eat in Montreal, but I don't think I would wait 30mins in line to get a table inside."}
{"text":"Perfecto!! Worth it to wait.. One of my favorite place to go on the weekend. Tabokki, seafood pancake, bibimbap dolsot, ramyunn!!"}
{"text":"Super !! Une très bonne découverte ! La carte comporte des photos de chaque plat, ce qui permet de mieux visualiser ce que l'on va manger, et tout est expliqué. Vraiment très bon, servis rapidement, et l'ambiance donne l'impression d'être parti en voyage ! Nous avions pris une entrée avec plusieurs choses frites, la friture est très légère, c'est vraiment bon ! Puis un plat de nouilles et un plat aux gésiers de poulets. Tous deux délicieux !!"}
{"text":"I went once a few weeks ago and loved it.  Wide variety of Korean dishes at a great prices.  Hip, casual and clean atmosphere.  Couldn't wait to come back.  Sadly, it appears that they've shut down when I tried to go there last Saturday. There was a sad looking sign in Korean (pas de français) and the tables inside were in utter disarray.  So sorry to see this place go. What a pity.  UPDATE:  As of September 12, 2015, they're back in business.  YUMMY!  UPDATE: As of January 29, 2017, they're closed again."}
{"text":"My friend and I were staying in Montreal, walking back to our hotel to eat dinner. We stopped in here for as a snack because we were so hungry. The place is so cute! We got a kimchi appetizer and a baked yam appetizer. The yam was in a sweet sauce. We each got our own portion because we don't share food. We got an appetizer size of food that was so generous that we I longer had to eat dinner at the hotel. So good!!! Her's was venue tempura and mine was veggie kimbap. We don't eat meat so there were some nice vegetarian options there to chose from."}
{"text":"I'm absolutely obsessed with this place. The vibe is amazing, the food is amazing, the service is amazing.. I want to go every day of my life for every meal. Thank you. And I love how they play that k pop stuff on the TV."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at GaNaDaRa. I recommend folks get there either early or late because I have seen lines waiting out the door, especially on nice weather weekends. The restaurant is 1 block away from the Guy-Concordia Metro. Be careful not to miss it because there is no signage. Staff is super friendly. Hours run late - until 10pm Mon-Thur and 1am on Fri and Sat nights. Food is relatively inexpensive for its quality, taste and creativity (Korean fusion). Plenty of drinks on the menu including beer, aromatized flavored beers, soju, maewhasoo and cocktails. Clean modern space with Korean K-pop music videos seen on the TV screen.   I was a single diner arriving at a 11pm on a Friday night and did not have to wait, although the restaurant was still full. I was recommended and got 1) cream tobboki (c$8.50), and 2) jeyuk dupbap (c$11.50). The tobboki with cream sauce (think Alfredo) came with bacon, mushroom and onions. It was weird yet delicious at the same time. Tobboki was nice and soft and dish was a nice mix of Korean and Italian flavors. The jeyuk dupbap (spicy pork with veggies over rice) was excellent as well. Pork was tender and perfectly marinated. Spice was at a good level. Veggies added a nice blend to the dish.   Will definitely come back next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Great place for quick Korean street food. Always long line up but practical for order-out , just give them a call and let them know what you want. Good luck finding the menu online. And they use the same red sauce for almost all their meals. But it tastes good"}
{"text":"Vraiment bon et super épicer service assez lent et c'est assez bruyant. Sinon j'aime bien et vraiment peu coûteux ."}
{"text":"Got there last week for dinner before 6pm, which is why were seated in 10mins instead of waiting in the huge line-up that snakes around the block! This was my second visit, after not liking it the first time but decided to give it another shot. The service was great - very attentive servers with a fun ambiance. I ordered the toppoki with noodles and the beef ramen, and got to try the deep fried chicken and chicken & vegetable sauté on rice. The toppoki was very spicy even though we ordered medium spice and I had the same issue again with the sauces being too acidic/sour/spicy, giving me instant heartburn and not really making me want to keep eating. This hasn't happened to me at other Korean restaurants in Montreal so I have a feeling it's specific to the way GaNaDaRa makes their sauces. Also, the chicken they use isn't chicken breast and had some weird pieces. Will not be returning because I just don't enjoy their flavours. Still better than my previous experience and I liked the beef ramen most."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Korean food, and I have to admit Ganadara is the best resto I've been in Montreal. I go there pretty often, and I just can't get enough of their food.  I highly recommend the seafood pancake, soon tofu soup  with seafood and beef kimbap. They're so delicious and unique!!"}
{"text":"A good natured host, whimsical quotes peppering the wall, steaming bowls of Cheese Ramyun, and delightfully weird K-pop music videos on a perpetual loop; place looks like a keeper.   Once you get past ordering off the menus that were obviously designed by a camel or some other creature with absolutely no knowledge of how normal humans logically read menus, you're off on a highly palatable journey of experiencing the best Korean (I've yet to have) in Montreal. What makes it the best? everything is fresh, authentic, colorful,  piping hot (when it's supposed to be), and gets to your table and into your mouth at near warp speed. Additionally, the chow is so cheap you'll be asking yourself whether some rich North Korean is secretly funding the place for spying purposes and whether they're plastering numbers smaller than 10 on the blackboard just to keep up appearances.   This Guy-Concordia area haunt is a must for any and all bibimbap seeking Kimchi junkies, ketchup/salt/sugar packet stealing broke students, and any Korean food anonymous members.   Best enjoyed with between one and fourteen adult beverages.   Kali Orexi"}
{"text":"Probably my favourite Korean restaurant in Montreal. Nice food and reasonable price. Ahdhshsbdshshshshshshs hdhsbsbsbssbsbs hhdhehdysbshxhxh shaysvs is the way you to me and I don't know why you are the only reason why"}
{"text":"Food is awesome. Good service. Can't complain. (Their ramen is delicious). If I'm going for dinner, it's better to go early (17-18h) otherwise I'll have to wait outside and line up. The service is fast but the place is always packed. It is vegan friendly, they'll listen to the special needs from  clients. Love it!"}
{"text":"Although prices were right, I was a bit disappointed with my experience here at dinner. I went because it had the most reviews on Yelp for Korean food in Montreal. Although there is ample seating inside, there is always a line up outside, which makes it seem even more hyped...and there are no visible markings on the exterior of the restaurant so the only way of finding it is GPS or by seeing the long line!   We had: - Tuna \"sushi\": it had cooked tuna, which I should have known to stay away from, but it was only $4.50...it was too fishy, although portion was large for the price!  - Tsunami tobboki: I wanted to eat something fried, so I chose this dish. Aside from fried sushi, there was fried zucchini, fried sweet potato, and fried mushrooms! However, I really didn't care for the spicy ramen noodles underneath the pile of fried food. I wish they had Korean glass noodles instead. The tobboki and fish cake slices were yummy though! I could NOT finish it.  - Soodonbu (pork belly): I preferred this the most, as it was more authentic. The broth was not too spicy, the pork belly came in thin slices, and there was ample soft tofu. I could finish this!   - Bibambap: This was not spicy, and had lots of garnishes to mix with the rice! It tasted very light and healthy. But definitely not as traditional tasting as regular Korean places.   Side dishes: they only have kimchi, and it didn't quite taste like traditional kimchi; there were no leafy parts of the cabbage...it was an ok appetizer to crunch on, but they really need to have more sidedishes, and they aren't that expensive anyways! (Welcome additions would be: potatoes, beansprouts, seaweed...etc).   Their water tasted weird (and not filtered), and did not have ice so since we were all pretty much having spicy dishes, we asked for ice and they gave us new ice waters (which tasted better).   Overall, good value for your money if you are craving spicy Korean food, but a far cry from the traditional Korean tastes at other restaurants. However, they do market themselves as a fusion restaurant, although I was hoping it would be a bit more authentic than it was!"}
{"text":"There's a reason there's always a line up in front of ganadara - the food is tasty and cheap. Ganadara serves modern almost fusion korean food at affordable prices in a cute environment.   I love their tofu soup, its one of the most flavourful ones that I've ever had. Their tofu bibimbap is also quite good, with a huge fired soft tofu. If you are in a mood for pigging out, do try their supreme poutine - it comes with basically every meat they have on their menu as well as rice cakes and ramen!!"}
{"text":"We left New York Saturday morning at 5:00 AM. By the time we arrived at our hotel we were hungry. This was our first meal in Montreal. At first we thought maybe we should check out a french place, but who are we kidding right? We got to the restaurant at 12:30PM and it was busy busy. The placed was packed the entire time we were in there. The food was great, and despite it being super busy, the service could not have been better. The servers are fast, efficient and all very friendly. I would highly recommend this fine Korean restaurant in the middle of Canada."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place for good Korean street food.   There's no reservation so there's a wait out the door.  Boo Boo and I ordered rice cakes with fried stuff, bimbibap served in the hot clay bowl, kim bap (tuna roll) and a seafood broth soup. I also got a large sapparo to was everything down.   The TV had Kpop on."}
{"text":"This was my first time back here ever since it finished renovating two months ago and I have to say, the place looks so much more polished. There was a short line right outside the door but we were two people so there was no wait at all (and because it was 2:30pm so most of the traffic from lunchtime cleared out by then).  We ordered the tuna kimbap and the dolsot bibimbap to share between two and it also came with a couple bites of kimchi before our food came. The bibimbap was pretty good, though a little bland after a while unless paired with the sauce that it came with, which I expected to be spicier but was more of a salty flavour. Also, the chickpeas were unexpected and threw me off a little. The kimbap was tasty, but had too much mayonnaise for my taste. The portions were a good amount - we finished the meal with two kimbaps leftover.  Overall a satisfactory lunch."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is amazing! Friendly staff and the prices are very much affordable!"}
{"text":"Overall, the dishes were to my satisfaction.   The last time I went, the restaurant was dated and old.  Now, with the renovations, it looks more modern.    We ordered the tonkatsu roll, vegetarian bimbibap and bulgogi ramen.  The waiter was friendly, and spoke in our native language once we settled into our meal.  The only downside:   small restaurant, expect lineups during peak times.  UPDATE 2nd review:  when I came back from Toronto, the first restaurant I wanted to go was ganadara!  But there was a huge lineup, and the weather was cold, didn't want to wait out.  So I decided to go when the restaurant opens at 11:30 a few days later to avoid the line ups!  Boy, did I not regret, the restaurant was full in 30 mins!   We ordered 6 dishes, all of them were excellent!  I'm not going to write too much about it, the pics will explain itself!"}
{"text":"The line is long but worth waiting honestly!  Be careful if you have sensitive abdomen because most of the food here is spicy"}
{"text":"Damn good Korean food. Everything's good. Quicker than Usain Bolt service but like pretty racist to just employee the people of the foods ethnic background so like mostly good food for racists"}
{"text":"Definitely our go-to korean street food spot! The food is always good and the prices are so cheap. Don't go at the usual dinner time 'cause there probably will be a line-up. I like going there earlier or on week days. I took my friend there and it was his first korean food experience, he LOVED it."}
{"text":"I believe it's more of a word of mouth type of restaurant, I could have walked by without noticing it, however there was a waiting time outdoors, I waited 20 minutes. Once I opened the doors to enter the restaurant, I instantly smelt all the different aromas ! The different food presentations going by all looked very delicious ! I ordered Dupbap, personally the beef I ordered lacked taste, I tried the chicken as well and it was very soft.. However the servers were very nice and helpful, the restaurant was clean and had a nice ambiance, I would recommend this place to mostly students, the servings are satisfying and affordable."}
{"text":"Great Korean street food. I had the beef with rice which was very well cooked. Definitely coming back to try something else.   You can easily miss this place by driving by. The only way I found it was by the lineup of people waiting to get in. You don't see 'GaNaDaRa' anywhere outside or inside the shop but in the menu. Waited about 20 mins to get seated though but it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Overhyped. That would be the word that I'd describe this small restaurant. To be fair, while the food is decent, the hype around this restaurant is out of proportion to what it offers.   I vividly remember times where I waited about an hour before being seated. I only waited that long because all my other friends wanted to go this place.   Like I said earlier, the food itself is decent. Nothing to rave about, even less to wait an hour for! They offer different Korean dishes, but with a small american touch. It can give for an interesting taste, but I am not a fan of it. Last time I went, I decided on the place of cheese chicken katsu. While it was filling, the taste was not diversified enough. I also ordered the \"Dak Balls\" which were basically fried chicken balls. That however, was very good. But I mean, how can you really mess up fried chicken.  Overall, the place might be worth a visit when there isn't a line!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! My girlfriend took us their for our anniversary. The food was delicious. Can't wait to go back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"A great mix of North American culture with Korean culture.I've been here numerous times , my favourite meal being the Bulgogi soup,the base is spicy but in a good way.The chicken katsu is very good a little bit on the salty side but still yummy.One thing I found interesting was the Korean poutine made with Tobboki ,the sauce is sweet and is a great option if you wanna try poutine but you don't like traditional gravy"}
{"text":"While perhaps not the best representation of authentic Korean cuisine, GaNaDaRa does Korean fusion food very well. Normally I'm skeptical of anything Asian Fusion due to it being akin to overly sweet Americanized Chinese food back in the States, but I was pleasantly surprised here. The tiny spot also seems to be filled with an Asian crowd as well, meaning it obviously has to have some sort of good reputation, right? The verdict, as always, follows below...  I ordered a kimchi pancake and a cheese chicken katsu plate, and I was really surprised by how much food I was given. If I remember correctly, kimchi pancakes are usually thin and on the crispier side, but here, they're very thick and have no shortage of kimchi and pork belly goodness on the inside. This isn't really a bad thing in my book, but it might make the Korean food purists a bit nitpicky. Also, I will insert here that the kimchi they serve is actually pretty decent and sour, unlike Kantapia's which really does nothing to mask the flavor and texture of raw cabbage. Finally, the cheese chicken katsu plate was extremely filling and satisfying, and I especially loved the corn salad side dish. The side cabbage salad with thousand island dressing was good as usual, and the cheese chicken katsu was the perfect combination of crispy breaded coating, juicy chicken, and melty mozzarella cheese. The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was the rice, as I don't really like plain white rice and felt that some sauce had to go along with it to make it taste like something.  I definitely feel that Concordia students have the leg up over McGill students when it comes to the Korean place within close proximity to campus - Kantapia doesn't have as diverse of a menu, and the quality pales in comparison as well. If it weren't so far from where I lived I would without a doubt bring people here more often."}
{"text":"This place was so good. It was well worth the line up even on a Monday. The food was cheap, very filling and absolutely delicious. I'm definitely coming back for a second trip to try out more of their menu."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to eat if you like satisfying Korean comfort food in generous portions with bold flavours. Allegedly, my brother has tried to come here several times unsuccessfully due to excessively long lines. We came at around 2pm and only had to wait 5 minutes. Service was prompt and cordial, prices were reasonable.  In terms of the food, the dak ball (fried chicken) and the Jeon (korean pancake - we had the seafood version) were both marvelous in an unhealthy pub food kind of way. I had the cream tobboki, which is really just a rich creamy alfredo sauce with rice cakes, bacon and all. It wasn't my thing, but still delicious. In the end, we had too much food, and boy was I glad I took the leftovers, because they just the hit spot when I needed a snack later that night!"}
{"text":"my first food stop since arriving into montreal! a little difficult to find since there's no name out at the front but the girl at the hotel that i'm staying at knew where it was since she said there's almost always a line out the door.   i arrived on a sunday afternoon and the place was packed - mainly tables of 2-4. luckily just waited less than 10 minutes for a spot. service was prompt and friendly - all staff, almost all customers were college-aged young asians. they automatically serve water and kim chi and the menu is nicely organized. looks like a lot of folks ordered the bimbimbap but i of course had to try their poutine.   all poutines come with tobboki (chewy rice cakes, fish cakes, cabbage, and egg) and at $8-9 it's a pretty good deal for the hefty portion that you get - would definitely recommend splitting if you're coming in for a snack. the food came out relatively quickly and was really fresh - french fries were crisp, rice cakes were awesomely chewy, fish cakes had a nice flavor, and it was perfectly spicy (good thing the water was there!). i was disappointed at first that they used shredded mozzarella instead of cheese curds i quickly understood that the chewy rice cakes balanced out the textures nicely. it was a bit messy to eat and i wasn't sure if i should use my fingers (since they're fries) or chopsticks (since it's a bit messy) but tummies don't care! clean single bathrooms, good place even for solo diners like me since they have kpop music videos playing. you pay at the counter (credit cards allowed)."}
{"text":"Food and service is good. Only 4 stars because of the waiting time. The place is kinda small, there's always a line of people waiting outside."}
{"text":"On ne peut pas se tromper en allant au GaNaDaRa! La longue file d'attente devant le restaurant (en tout temps) est un indice. Il faut faire attention puisque ça ferme avant l'heure du souper (16-17h) (pour le le staff se prépare) les plats sont savoureux. Ça vaut la peine d'aller là avec quelques personnes pour essayer plusieurs plats. Ça revient vraiment pas cher. Les soupes sont exquises! Que dire des nombreux choix de sautés! Le service est (trop) rapide et le staff est sympa. Tu n'as pas l'impression de manger à Montréal puisque tu es accompagné d'une super bonne musique tout le long de ton repas!"}
{"text":"We ordered the dak balls and beef bulgogi, WOW!!! The food here is so affordable and great. They could easily charge so much more for the quality, quantity, and service. There is a line outside this place and it moves very quickly. That also shows how good the place is....must come again!"}
{"text":"BEST RAMYAN SOUP EVER. definitely going back. Only positive things to say! Amazing service, food came really quickly, great suggestions, tons of vegetarian options, and great balance between somewhat spicy dishes and insanely spicy ones. Love it here!"}
{"text":"I had GaNaDaRa-sauced fried chicken, fried rice cake and fried dumplings. While the food and service was o.k. The price was a bit high."}
{"text":"Probably the BEST Korean restaurant in the province! The food can be a bit greasy if you have too much, but they taste great. Their tsunami teokbokki was amazing"}
{"text":"Dylan Kong was the nicest server I've encountered during my 21 years of restaurant dining! Super cool guy go check him out PS. Food was good too"}
{"text":"Food is great and price very reasonable. Service was fast and good. Waited 20 mins outside though. Its more like a student place since its cheap and meals are pretty good in size. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"I order dolsot bibimbap at every Korean restaurant and it just wasn't good here. Hardly any meat and no sauce. A positive was the mushrooms. I preferred the bibimbap at Tianxia Coreen Restaurant a few blocks away."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food, but 3 stars for the hella long queue every single day! I can't deny that the food is really tasty but i won't want to wait half an hour for it. I have been going to restaurant mon ami instead which isn't too far."}
{"text":"Great Korean in Montreal, everything is delicious and made with a flair. Make sure you are here 15 minutes before they open or you will have to wait to get in.  Thank you to the staff for the smile and great service they provide!"}
{"text":"Wow. Been hearing about this place for years but never attempted going because of the line I always see outside. Now I understand why. Was definitely worth the wait!   Great portions for very reasonable prices. Staff is super friendly & helpful in terms of recommendations, efficiency, etc.   Food is absolutely delicious. Every single dish had its own personality when introduced to my pallet. Super fresh ingredients with a nice twist to even the most 'basic' dishes.   I got the marinated beef bibimbap. We shared vegetable dumplings, dak balls (fried chicken in a delicious sweet & sour sauce), shrimp bibimbap (quite spicy) pa dak (fried chicken balls). The beef bibimbap needed a little spicy kick, so they give you hot sauce on the side.    Definitely coming back to explore more of that delicious menu!"}
{"text":"Bonne petite place pour manger du coréen pas cher du tout. Max 30 places assis, vous pouvez aussi prendre pour apporter. Attention, pour les gens qui aiment les resto propre propre, la partie vers les toilettes fait peur. Aussi il y avait un cheveux dans notre assiete, mais bon c'est des choses qui arrivent!   Je suis desole, pas de photo du menu et de nos plats car j'ai manqué de batterie, mais je vais faire une description exaustive. Nous avons testé le jus de riz, mmm que dire, c'etait tres sucré et il y avait une tonne de morceaux de riz (je suppose) alors je ne recommande pas, a moins que vous aimez l'aventure des textures. Puis une liqueur au yogourt, c'etait tres tres bon, un peu gazeifié et fruité!   Ensuite on a eu une entré de roulé (gateau) au riz dans une sauce rouge epicée, c'etait bon, mais sans plus. Puis une entrée de patates douces, courgette, champignon, crevette, etc frits dans une pate fine, c'etait wow pour 5$. Repas principal, une soupe ramen a la coreen bien sur au boeuf, le bouillon etait savoureux, et l'oeuf poché amenait un petit plus. Et un sauté au boeuf et legumes, qui etait bon mais rien de special. Le riz blanc etait cuit a la perfection, collant comme j'aime. Je vais y retourner malgré tout!"}
{"text":"Food was average and nothing to rave about but it is good value for typical quick Korean chow. No complaints but wouldn't wait in line for it, which is typically required since it is quite a popular joint especially among the younger crowd."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic little spot for a quick bite. It's always packed, and so it should be. The chicken nuggets in Ganadara sauce is my favorite thing here. The chicken is deep-fried, crispy, and juicy. Perfect! The portions are also very good. One of my favorite places in Montreal. My only criticism is physical space is very tiny. I felt cramped the entire time, but the food made it well worth it."}
{"text":"Former regular lunch time spot when I worked downtown. I kinda miss the sappy cat stickers on the wall!"}
{"text":"delicious Korean food downtown....exterior of the place looks a little scary, but modern updated interior. tacky japanese music videos on their big screen tv up on the wall. LOL We had a bebimbop appetizer, which was tasty, and a chicken \"dak bimbop\" (?) dish, which had delicious grilled chicken, rice, bean sprouts, basil, chick peas, zucchini, carrots, and a light sauce. Really good. My partner had a spicy dish with Kim chi, chicken, shrimp, and a bunch of veggies & rice. he also had a \"ramyun\" ramen soup dish that was great. service was quick, friendly."}
{"text":"I go here all the time and I always leave happy. The food comes quick and is always hot. Food portions are generous at decent prices. I always order the padaak (korean fried chicken with green onions), cheese rice cakes, curry chicken katsu or their kimchi pork belly stew that comes with rice. They're all so delicious! Also, a friend of mine visiting from Korea told me this spot hits pretty close to home.   Arrive 10-15 mins before opening to avoid the lineups."}
{"text":"There are  a lot of people waiting every time I pass by, their food is great, i like it."}
{"text":"Nice fast Korean food in town but I will never go there if there still people line up outside for seat. My local friends told me there always a line up for this Korean restaurant so I went twice since I saw there are still some tables available. Tried beef rib, rice cakes, beef don, seafood tofu soup, both of them are tasty with real Asian flavour but nothing amaze me. I realized part of the reason why people line up during dinner time is their kitchen has break time between 4pm to 5pm but they still let people walk in and wait until 4:55 to order, that's why people have to line up for long time to wait after 5pm, thats y, i guess, as a foreign visiter."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and have sampled most if not all of the dishes on the menu.  There is an interesting dish, the bttokti poutine, which mixes fries with the traditional Korean ttuboki, a sort of elongated cylinder-shaped bite sizes of rice flour, served with a spicy sweet sauce. Although I do not eat very spicy, the heat is tolerable and nicely balanced with the starch of the potatoes.   One of the items I keep on going back for is the fried chicken, which you have to wait 20 minutes for if you order, but it is absolutely worth it. It comes with 5 giga chicken drumsticks, with a crusty coating and juicy meat. Simple and is a home-run everytime.   Another of my favourites is the bibimpab served on a hot stone bowl. The portion is generous and the flavours are nicely balanced and portioned between all the components. Do not forget a dash of hot sauce to savour this dish the way it was meant to be eaten.  Some of the menu items that I do not like as much are the ramyun, which is basically instant noodles with some toppings (they also serve a cheesy version), and the kimbap, the Korean equivalent of sushi. Both are okay, but I've had better elsewhere.  When the bill comes, despite the amount of food you will have ingested, it will be quite a little amount. This place feels homey, authentic, and without pretense."}
{"text":"Good food, good service! The place is always packed but the noise level is perfectly acceptable.   The bibimbap was one of the best I've had in Montreal. Cant speak to the rest. The mushrooms were cooked just right!  The decor is the best best the ambiance is still there. K-Pop is playing in the background all the time. It is pretty cool. It can be cramped depending on where you are sitting.   If you don't mind waiting in line for 20 minutes you will definitely enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"My fav korean restaurant and I've been to many in Montreal and Toronto! The staff is super nice and welcoming. The food is pretty cheap, especially for the portions. My favourite dishes are the soondobu jiggae bulgogi and the chadolbegi. The spicy tuna kimbaps are also really yummy! I wish they had cold noodles, but it's not a deal breaker. Only downside is that this place is always packed and they don't take reservations so I would not recommend it for a group of more than 4 people... Or be ready to wait for 20+minutes outside"}
{"text":"As two newbies to Korean food, we loved this place. We stood in line, but it moved very quickly. We ordered a pint of Sapporo, and asked the waiter for his recommendations. Waiter was excellent. Very friendly, knowledgeable and willing to explain the dishes. When the food arrived, it was amazing. I had fried tofu with my dish, and it was most delicately fried- amazing texture, not oily. My husband had a shrimp dish, and he too was pleased. I even enjoyed watching the Korean pop on the video monitor! Give it a try."}
{"text":"Authentic Korean food at reasonable price.  It's a tiny place so be ready to wait on weekends.   Kimchi soup & Beef & veggie on the rice are my favorite."}
{"text":"When people ask me for good Korean food in Montreal, I always point them to this place. I heard that their line ups are insane for lunch and dinner, but when we went, we got pretty lucky, and got a table within 15 minutes.   It's been a while since I've been there, but I remember their giant spicy tuna kimbab (rolls), and my boyfriend's order of chadolbakgi (stir fried kimchi with bulgogi on rice). This is your typical Korean \"fast\" food, and it reminded me of my days back in New York City's K-town outings.   Their portion sizes are huge, the servers are attentive, and unfortunately the place plays an array of flashy, unbearable kpop. But I guess this adds to the authenticity of Korean culture. Definitely a must if you're interested in delicious Korean food!"}
{"text":"Before this visit, I had only had Korean style BBQ in Seoul.   This was well cooked, fast, and plenty of food.   The restaurant itself is the smallest little restaurant but is quite busy!   Loved the chop sticks and forks.   They also play Korean music videos - which are crazy, but awesome."}
{"text":"After spending 3 days in Montreal eating poutine and French food, we were having a major hankering for Korean food and stumbled upon this Korean joint. Although the place was packed, we were the only Asian people there which left us skeptical. We ordered tofu soup, spicy rice cakes, seafood ramen, and tuna kimbap. Everything was surprisingly spicy but very tasty. The kimbap was the standout. It tasted very homemade like grandmas kimbap. I wish we had ordered another one. I'm pretty sure the ramen was instant shin ramen but it really hit the spot."}
{"text":"Always busy. Servings are huge. Some food are worth it. some are so so. I like the bibimbap, chicken curry, and tonkatsu with cheese. Worth the wait. But small table, and less space. Hard to move. but good food"}
{"text":"Great place with big portions. Loved the food there, and the service was great. Went there with a group of 4 people, and we waited in line outside for around 30min, but it was worth the wait. The place is a bit small, but the service is fast, and the food is filling. It was my first time trying it, but it wont be my last :) recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Tried 4 dishes of which 3(poutine supreme, curry chicken katsu and dak bibimbap were simply out of bounds. The other dish(moitie) was that great."}
{"text":"Small restaurant with big potential. Recommended to me by some local Korean students. Good food at reasonable prices. Tough to get a table of more than 2 as dining area only has 5 of them. This restaurant has such a following that there's not even a sign out front. Also, when the staff hung a sign saying they will be closed for 3 weeks starting July 24 2016, the regulars weren't too pleased."}
{"text":"Lived up to the reviews! I brought friends who know Korean food better than I and right away they were happy telling me this joint reminded them of lunch places they remembered from living there, the prices and decor felt right and oddly homey, and the food when it arrived (almost immediately) was among the most authentic they'd had.   As for me, all I know is: delicious! The bibimbap was full of perfect fresh ingredients, crispy in the stone bowl, amazingly healthy and so crazy good I wanted to curl up inside it. The spicy ramyun was bangin (so much so that I barely paused when I got broth in my eye and was nearly blinded. No problem. Keep slurping, it'll sort itself out.) The Bulgogi Ramyun was as good as Rawan K promised, and all these 3 big hot bowls, plus two yummy appetizers and we still paid under 10$ each. Huge love for GaNaDaRa!"}
{"text":"First time eating Korean food and not at a Koren BBQ,  it great the they can change your dish to make it less spicy and not expensive"}
{"text":"The food is really good, but we went today and even tough it says here that they are open today they weren't. They should update their schedules or at least put them on the door. Its really disapointing to make your way all over there and they are not even open."}
{"text":"Voilà encore une belle découverte en centre ville!  L'endroit est assez petit mais est très propre et mignon comme tout!  Ce qui est amusant c'est que leur menu est accompagné de photo pour chaque plat. De cette façon, quand le nom du plat ne vous dit pas grand chose, au moins vous avez une petite idée de ce à quoi vous attendre! Plutôt sympa comme idée!   Personnellement, je ne mange pas très piquant, j' ai donc demandé au serveur si certains plats étaient piquants et m'a très bien conseillé. J' ai pris un sauté de buf au petits légumes et riz ( j'ai oublié le nom, oups!) C'était très bon! La viande était bien moelleuse et pas sèche, les légumes légèrement croquants et la petite sauce avait très bon goût! De plus, les quantités sont généreuses et le prix très abordable!  Oh! J' ai failli oublier, ils sont très rapides pour servir!   C'est la bonne formule: manger relativement sain, bien, pas cher et rapide! Quoi demander de plus!   Alors, une envie de manger coréen?! N' attendez plus et allez chez GaNaDaRa!"}
{"text":"J'ai commandé le bibimpa vegetarien. Le serveur a même oublié de me donne la sauce de bibimpa au début! La qualité du riz qu'il utilise dans ce bibimpa est très très mauvaise ( je crois que j'ai le droit de dire ça puisque je suis asiatique). En plus il est trop cuit et trop collant.  La sauce est très bon et très classique. Mais ca semble qu'il n'y a pas assez de bouteille de sauce dans ce restaurant, puisque le serveur veut retirer cette sauce sur ma table....."}
{"text":"Was in Montreal visiting and saw great ratings for this place - was not disappointed.  There was a line that extended outside the building but the wait was not long. We ordered their yogurt soju and some apps and rice bowls. The servers were attentive and the food was awesome! Reasonably priced too!"}
{"text":"This is the best Korean food I ate yet. I come at least 3 times a week. The staff are really polite and nice. The ambiance with the music it's really nice. I always take seafood ramen with cheese Tteok-bokki (rice cake ) with also milkis as a drink. Definitely try it once at least. There is a lot more options of course."}
{"text":"Visited Montreal for a weekend and decided to check this place out. It's small and we waited on a line outside for about 15 minutes. Once inside we got galbi bibimbap and pork ramyun with a side of Dak balls. By far the best Korean food I have ever had!! The dak balls were amazing 10/10 and my ramyun was so full of flavor. I asked if it could be made half spicy and it was just what I wanted. Usually half spicy is either still super spicy or nothing at all. This was perfect. I definitely will return the next time I'm in Canada and will recommend to anyone I know going!"}
{"text":"Ganadara is small and cozy. It is located near Concordia. My friends and I come here often. The ramen is spicy and very tasty. The marinated beef in the ramen is delicious. The dak balls are also very tasty. Pieces of deep fried chicken covered in a sweet and spicy sauce. The prices are very affordable and the service is fast. However, it does get very busy and you will most likely have to wait in line to be seated if you go around dinner time."}
{"text":"I always leave satisfied from the food here! The only downfall is the insane popularity of this place. Meaning the only time I ever go is at exactly 5pm when it opens, or else you can expect to wait 15-30 mins!!  My partner and I's faves are the spicy tuna kimbap, kimchi pancake and beef stir fry. Price is decent, service decent. I definitely like it more than Mon Ami  A staple!"}
{"text":"The food was okay !!! I wasn't that impressed nothing out of norm !!!! Nowadays there are so many places that have similar dishes   !! So I don't get the long line up for it !!! It worth to try once but I personally won't go to line up again to eat there ."}
{"text":"Had never been here before and saw the long lineups. After eating an awesome rice bowl with vegetables and the egg for 11$ I totally understand why. The sauce with the right amount of spicyness hit the spot. Staff was real nice and the K-Pop videos on the TV were just hilarious. Recently renovated so the sign is gone but the inside is real nice. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Never miss stopping in when in Montreal.  Everything is perfect ... worth waiting in the always existing line!"}
{"text":"Go there almost every week! If you love spicy foods, go for the kimchi stew it's delicious! The bimibap (probably the wrong spelling) in the hot bowl in also excellent as well as the ribs (once again not sure of the real name but yummy!!). The appetizers are very well priced as well, have had the dak balls and the dumplings and both are also very good!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try Ganadara for the first time. We had to wait in line for about 20 minutes before we got to sat down at a table.  For our appetizer we ordered the fried dumplings and it came with a salad in the middle which was weird. The dumplings were good but I think it would of tasted better if they weren't deep fried. The waitress gave us a small complimentary plate of kimchi and I thought it was gross. I didn't like how the Kimchi was served warm, it should of been served cold. I ordered the seafood soondubu and it was piping hot and delicious. My boyfriend ordered the curry tonkatsu with rice. The tonkatsu portion was pretty big and he really enjoyed it. Overall, I think Ganadara's food is good for Montreal.  The service was only okay. It's not the best service because the restaurant is really busy. Sometimes I have to ask the server the same questions a few times.   The ambiance was loud because it was filled with young people. Ganadara is a little small and cramped. Also seems like they don't turn on their air conditioning or maybe they don't have one. This restaurant is not recommended for big groups."}
{"text":"This is easily the best Korean restaurant I have eaten at in Montreal. Everything about this place is perfect from the tasty kimchi served at the beginning of the meal to the high quality chopsticks and spoon to the bowls and plates the dishes are served in.   The food is extremely well priced and the quality is worthy of me calling it one of my favourite restaurants in Montreal.  The uniqueness of the dishes make this a very special restaurant and I can't wait to go back. If you don't believe me just try the famous poutine.  I am very particular when it comes to eating ramen in a restaurant as I feel that no one can make it like myself, however I was very pleasantly surprised. The best broth I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"Had a craving for some Korean food while in the area for Grand Prix weekend.  Pretty much a college hangout and all in all a good place for a late snack.  Everything was pretty solid, the infused beer was interesting,washed down the kalbi, poutines, wings and squid pretty well."}
{"text":"Best non-general tao dish I've ever had. Why's it so light? And crispy? Why? How? The ramen bowl was also great, but it's that Korean general Tao that I still think about.  Lines can get pretty long so be prepared to wait during peak hours. For the price and quality of food, it's worth the wait. Fantastic waiters too, to top it off."}
{"text":"I've always left happy and satisfied. I wish it were a little larger, because the tables are pretty tight. The staff is great, the food is very tasty, and there is a nice range of options on the menu. I like the K-Pop music videos playing in the background, adds nicely to the ambiance. It's chill, it's youthful, it's fast service, great!"}
{"text":"So good, this place always has a line up outside of it! If you want to avoid it though, come just before they open and you should be able to find a place. Or, you could skip the line and wait ten minutes if you order to go. It's not exactly authentic Korean, but does amazing Korean fusion. Highly recommended, good portions, great prices."}
{"text":"Friendly and nice food in Montreal~! I ordered Tobboki Tsunami and it was a big portion that I couldn't finish myself."}
{"text":"Great little spot near the museum. The menu had some great option and the food was delicious and the design of this place is just a plus (I liked the lights). Its a bit hard to find but its right next to a laundry place."}
{"text":"My brother stayed in Montreal for 6 months and said this was the best cheap spot he found.  The restaurant did a very good job at utilized every square foot.  The atmosphere was very cosy and the food was good.    Our group tried the bibimbap, seafood ramen, rice with squid, and the dak balls.  The ramen was decent for a restaurant not dedicated to ramen.  Good amount of mussels in the dish.  Bibimbap and the squid was also reported to be good.  The dak balls (fried chicken) was okay.  Not very crunchy.    Good Korean restaurant in French Canada."}
{"text":"This place was PACKED when I came here, so I ended up ordering take-out instead of eating in. I think I've been too spoiled by good Korean food in the US because I did not find the bibimbap authentic at all. Instead of radishes and carrots, there were bell peppers (??) which really took away from the vinegar-y taste it should have as a base mixed in with the meat. However, the service was quick and I was able to get my dinner when I needed to and it's affordable."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday for lunch and it was great. There's always a line up outside the door because it's busy and the space inside is pretty small. The waitress was really nice and didn't have to wait long to get the food. I ordered a grilled chicken ramen, extra spicy with a well done egg and cheese. I don't usually eat much ramen but this is definitely one of the best ones I've ever had. The taste of everything in the bowl was just really and satisfying especially for the price. Overall great taste, good service and location and will be back soon for more."}
{"text":"This place is really unsanitary. I ordered a ginger ale and there was a BUG in my ginger ale.   Other than that, so far and apparently people said this place is the best place in mtl for Korean food and it's quite sad if that's true. I'm not from Montreal I am from Toronto so my review can be a bit biased since I've had probably a lot better and yummier Korean foods in Toronto Australia USA and Korea itself.  The staff are really nice. Although I had to ask a couple times for more napkins until they brought us some more which was only another 2 pieces.   The side dishes... Very disappointing because we only got Kim chi. Other Korean restaurants I've been to had at least a minimum of 3 dishes up to almost 8! But we only got one, which was Kim chi and we even asked if they had anything else and they said no. Apparently sometimes they have potatoes but they said no so I assume it's very inconsistent.   This was my second time coming here only because I had forgotten how bland the food was. This is probably the blandest food I've ever had and if you're genuinely a Korean food lover, you'll know that Korean food is not supposed to taste bland lol. We ordered quite a lot of dishes for two people as always. Our dolsot bibimbap, you can't even taste the ground beef. My boyfriend had to double check if there was even beef. We used almost half of the bibimbap paste sauce bottle because there was no flavour and literally tasted like a vegetarian one. We got kimbap which was pretty bland, the soup was good though, get that if you go. We got the seafood tofu soup which came with a bowl of rice. Also their seafood tobokki was good but not the best I've had.  I think I'll only return back to this place again when I have forgotten how bland the food is.   Giving 2 stars instead of one because the soup was good, and they did offer candy at the counter which had more flavour than their actual meals.  This place is over hyped as there is usually always a line up at the door and as you can see in reviews a lot of raves about it but I've had better Korean food and this is not one of them, one of the bad ones if you ask me."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Korean spots in downtown. When coming to this resto, always expect a line up to get in as it's a pretty popular spot.  Came here for supper with some friends, and took a little longer to get a table as we were 4 people. Once seated, we were served and received our food fairly quickly despite the rush. We ordered some chicken Dak Ball, Beef Bibimbap, Kimchi and Soondobu Jigae with a choice of meat and rice on the side. The food was delicious, being flavourful with a kick of spice! The bibimbap have a good ration of rice, veggies and meat. The fried chicken was sweet and savoury, perfect for sharing. The stews were spicy but flavourful and is served sizzling hot. The portions were very fair, as well for the price. The servers were also nice and helpful, however the cashier made a mistake with my change (missing 5$), so it would be good to double check when paying.  Overall, this place has a great variety of delicious Korean food, with good portions and fair prices. Although, it may not be the best place for groups of 4+, as the place is small and will have a longer wait time for a table."}
{"text":"I would say it is normal. I couldn't understand why there are so many people waiting in lines. I feel the quality is just average if it is in China or in other east Asia countries."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favourite restaurants in Montreal. It's been almost a year since I stumbled upon this place and since then a month hasn't gone by without me paying a visit."}
{"text":"Don't fully believe the HYPE surrounding this restaurant, it's descent but you need to order the right food to make your visit worth it. If you come after 5:30 pm, there's usually a huge line. For my first visit, it took me about 20 minutes before I sat down. The restaurant is actually quite small so if your party is with two, then they fit you in a very small table, barely big enough to place all your food.  Food - it's new age Korean food. They do have a variety of dishes, but it's not traditional as they are missing dishes like the Pork Bone Soup and other types of stews. They also lack on a good selection of appetizers, in fact, the only appetizer is kimchi which compared to any other Korean restaurant in Montreal is very little. Now, they do have some very good plates including the Curry Tonkatsu Rice, and Seafood Soon Tofu. I also enjoyed their Chicken Wings, Seafoos Pancake, and Cheese Chicken Katsu Rice.   Speaking about the dishes with cheese - beware! Unless you love cheese to death, it might be a bit too much. It made the meal overly filling!  Service - it was good and servers were kind, but the kitchen chefs were accommodating. For example, they wouldn't let me try both flavours of chicken wings (spicy and original) on the same order, and they wouldn't let me have half seafood pancake and half kimchi pancake (which was clearly shown on the picture so that was a bit deceiving.)  I can see this spot continue being popular but don't have your expectations too high when stepping in the door if you are looking for traditional Korean food."}
{"text":"One of the best Korean restaurants in Montreal. Menu is extremely large and lots to choose from. Been going regularly and haven't had any bad experience or food that I didn't like yet. My go-tos are fosho the dak ball, seafood pancake, teobokki poutine and any of their dubbaps and katsus. They even have a dinner menu now! Only downside is that the restaurant is quite small and packed almost every night, so if you're going in a party (over 2) go there early! Price and portions are very reasonable too. Overall, recommend."}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner; there was a wait but it wasn't too long. I wouldn't come here as a bigger group. There were only two friendly people working the floor but they were hustling so it never felt like a long wait for service or food, even though it was packed.   Played it safe and ordered Katsu and spicy gizzards and vegetables. Both were excellent, and the portions were pretty big. Katsu was crispy, the gizzards were pleasantly spicy. Both came with just the right amount of rice. The atmosphere is really cozy because everyone is enjoying their food!   We were so happy with our meal, and it's really nice that it's very close to the Guy Concordia stop so we didn't have to walk in the cold for too long. I will be back to try more off the menu. The bibimbap looked really good!"}
{"text":"THE place to eat amazing authentic Korean food! So delicious, leaves you wanting more even when you've no room left...!  Only down side is the long lineup at peak hours... but totally worth the wait, even in the freezing cold! The yumminess will def warm up the soul!"}
{"text":"I was very pumped to try out GaNaDaRa after all the reviews and drooling over the pics of the food on Yelp.   Regarding the vegetarian options it's really limited to their bibimbaps which is disappointing BUT I appreciate how transparent they are about their dishes.   I tried the Tofu Dolsot Bibimbap which is really fantastic! I loved the fried tofu and the spicy sauce on the side is really great. My friend who is pescatarian swears by the tsunami ttoboki and the normal one of us loved the bulgogi beef.   For the food I'd give it a 3 stars for vegetarians and a 5 stars for all the usual people!   My only bone to pick was the slow service. They were very friendly and even brought us more kimchi but it was just snail paced! Go looking for good food and ready for the wait! I promise it's worth it!"}
{"text":"The taste of Naengmyeon( cold noodle) simply reminds me of the one in my hometown...the flavor is rich and fresh. Absolute love!"}
{"text":"Amazing Korean food with amazing customer service. My friends and I had to wait 20 mins but it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was excellent! Unfortunately the place does get crowded at night, but that's the price you pay for serving up such tasty foods.  From the cheese chicken katsu, spicy ahi bim bap, to their seafood pancake I highly recommend trying out this place."}
{"text":"My friend recommended we check this place out: she found it by googling \"good\" and \"cheap\" - or so she says. Well it's definitely both! And that fact makes it widely popular with the student crowd.  The place opens at 6:00 (I think??) in the evening, and you should line up well before. We made the mistake of running late, and had to wait 30 chilly minutes outside. Once inside the place is a bit cramped, but thankfully no one rushed us. The menu is bilingual and full of pictures, so don't worry! I ordered the tsunami, and it was sooo greasy, even by my standards. It's made of fried everything, with no veggie buffer at all! Delicious, for sure, but the sweet sauce was a bit much. My friend had less luck with her bibimbap: it was pretty dry, and the sauce they serve with it wasn't to her liking. Oh well. At least since it's pretty cheap you can drop by often and sample away!"}
{"text":"You see exactly same food you see on the menu, and it's extremely unusual.   The price is surprisingly affordable, as well.  I really struggled between 4 and 5 stars.  If I could, I would've given 4.5.    Why I decided against 5:  Firstly, I don't think it's not GaNaDaRa's fault.  I was lucky enough to get seated right away, but there were so many people waiting to be seated, and I would've been frustrated if I had to wait for 10-20 minutes.  Apparently, I could tell that GaNaDaRa's a hot place.  But if you're free enough to wait or have time other than weekend evening, I'd say go ahead.  Another thing is, due to the small size of the restaurant, there isn't any space you can be seated while you're waiting.  When people are leaving, the waiter might take time until you get seated, because there are only two waiters, and they just have so many orders.  (But to have more than two waiters, the restaurant would have even more traffic jam.)  Why I'm shooting for 4-5: For people who know Korean culture, this place is something in the middle of Bunshik-jib and a restaurant.  Food's really nice as I said it in the first sentence.  The food looked good, and it tasted good.  The amount was ample, so that it filled me up so much!  I had dduk-ggo-chi and je-yuk-deop-bap, and including tax and tips, I payed $20.  As I'm coming from New York City, if you get anything at this quality at this price, it would be called revolutionary!    Sidenotes: The atmosphere of the restaurant.  If you're thinking about calm dinner with lots of time to converse with your friends / date, this is not the choice.  It's a very busy place, and you wouldn't feel comfortable squatting down there, in front of all the people waiting for someone to get up.  It can be a little bit hectic, but if you like to try out good food at some vibrant, energetic small shoebox, this is your place!   The only thing GaNaDaRa should, at this point, is to expand their business, get more space and more waiters! I doubt there will be empty table even so."}
{"text":"A place that actually lives up to the hype!   Despite being a student nearby for a couple years, I never felt like braving the wait, until last week. And turns out it's worth it. The flavours are incredible, the spice level is just right and the menu, though limited, is clearly developed to perfection. The pork belly ramyun was my favourite of the night, closely followed by the seafood topokki The only slight disappointment was the fried chicken which I honestly found quite average despite the raving reviews.  Definitely a must try and return!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the food! Service was great as well. Definitely going back to try the other dishes on their menu. Went around 9 pm on a Saturday night, the wait time was approximately 20-25 min which wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"On chilly rainy nights, I crave something spicy and comforting and what better to make you feel all warm and cozy than a sizzling bowl of Korean bibimbap! The bibimbap was perfectly executed and the servers were extremely friendly and helpful with good suggestions. We also ordered Dak balls which were crispy and delicious! The cocktails are also quite good here. I ordered a Tokyo mule and my friend really loved the peach infused beer they got so there's something for everyone."}
{"text":"Overhyped:// had somewhat of high expectations for this spot, had heard of it from everywhere and was dying to finally try it out. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I'm a pescatarian but they were rather inflexible with their options. Apparently their chef is very firm with his approach to cooking and refuses to change certain recipes to people's food restrictions, which honestly, I totally understand because you can't guarantee a dish will be just as good if it isn't the original recipe so in that way you need to place your priorities. So I had to resort to more basic meatless options instead of altering the menu. Dishes were really basic and not as refined as I hoped they would be. Heard their chicken karaage was really good but guess i'll never know!"}
{"text":"Small place, long line to wait for seat. But it's worth it. The price is decent, food is great and the service is awesome.   The appetizers are good for its price. The main dishes are pretty big in size. I like the service there, I had good experience. The kim chi is somewhat different from other places.   I'm a bit disappointed that they don't have the pork bone stew (not sure what's it call) but I'll be back, there seems to have a lot of thong on the menu I wanted to try."}
{"text":"Probably the best Korean  restaurant I have ever been to in Montreal. The place is small and it has nothing on the outside that shows the characteristics of an average restaurant, except the long line of people waiting to grab a seat. The food is amazing! Very tasty, but very spicy for a person with a low tolerance in spiciness like me."}
{"text":"This place was BOMB.COM everything we ordered were soooo good!! This place serves the best Korean style food - anything from bibimbop all the way to their own style poutine. The place was a little hard to find for us since we weren't from here but since it had a line up it was easier to spot. It can probably seat 30-45 people max hence the lineup.   But on to the amazing food, we ordered three different entrees: bibimbap, chicken cheese katsu & curry chicken and one app (tobboki poutine) to share but we couldn't help but try each other's entrees as well. The portion sizes were reasonable to the price as well, very filling. We also had a side of kimchi that was all you can eat (it was also very good! - different from what I have been eating/making)"}
{"text":"Ok, this is my second time here and every-time the lines seem longer and longer. Now the question, is it worth the wait? ....Yes. I really love a couple of dishes here, for example this one of the best places for bibimbap in the city for me. And the very long list of dishes are great, and spicy if they are noted spicy. Based on what I have read it seems real to me, though I haven't traveled to Korea yet to know for sure. The one thing I must mention is that many of the dishes are heavy and fried so you don't leave feeling light and healthy. But as long as you are ok with that the food is great. Especially since it is open late and these heavy dishes are great after drinking."}
{"text":"En lisant les éloges sur ce restaurant coréen, je m'attendais vraiment à être aux anges et au final j'ai été assez déçue. Heureusement, j'y suis allée tard un dimanche soir, donc j'ai pu éviter la longue file d'attente qu'il y a habituellement.   Pour commencer, j'ai goûté les Dak Ball (le poulet épicé) typiquement coréen. Le poulet est très tendre (trop) et pas très goûteux. La sauce prend vraiment le dessus et je pense que si on ferme les yeux en mangeant ce plat, on ne devine pas qu'il s'agit de poulet ce qui est quand même dommage. Le point positif, c'est que la portion est très copieuse, donc on peut facilement en faire une entrée pour 2-3 personnes.   En plat principal, j'ai testé le Bulgogi Dupbap (buf mariné). Cette fois-ci, la viande avait du goût, mais était à mon goût un peu trop grasse. Le plat est bon, mais vu la quantité d'oignons, je ne vous recommande vraiment pas de le déguster lors d'un rendez-vous galant... Mon amie a choisi de goûter le Squid Dupbap et le calamar avait l'air de sortir tout droit du congélateur... là encore, c'est décevant.  Bref, GaNaDaRa ne m'a pas convaincue et je ne pense pas y retourner. J'espère trouver un meilleur restaurant Coréen à Montréal !"}
{"text":"Ce que j'adore de Montréal, c'est qu'au détour d'une rue, il est possible de sentir l'influence d'un autre continent, voir d'un autre pays. C'est ce qui arrive lorsqu'on se balade dans le quadrilatère fermé par les rues De Maisonneuve, Guy et St-Catherine (jusqu'à l'ancien Forum). Cet endroit regorge tellement de petit resto asiatique qu'on pourrait aisément le baptiser Asiatown.   Au nombre des belles découvertes culinaires qu'on peut y faire, se trouve le GaNaDaRa. Un petit boui-boui sympathique et accueillant qui offre des plats typiques de la cuisine coréenne. Au menu : Ramens, Bibimbap, Bulgogi et bien sûr, du Kimchi.   Sans être le meilleur resto coréen de Montréal, la nourriture offerte ici est très décente. En autre, les Ramens sont corrects et servis à même le chaudron qu'on dépose sur votre table. C'est simple mais charmant. Les Bibimbaps sont aussi très bon, quoi qu'ils pourraient être un peu plus parfumé et épicé. La clientèle, composée surtout d'étudiants coréens et asiatiques, ajoute au charme de ce petit resto toujours bondé. Ils sont attirés ici par l'aspect beau-bon-pas-cher du menu. Avec raison. Pour un bol de Ramens accompagné de riz, vous déboursez environs 7 $. Une aubaine ! C'est donc l'endroit idéal pour s'emplir la panse à petit prix à la suite d'une soirée dans le centre-ville ou après un cours de soir à l'université.       Le GaNaDaRa n'offre rien de génial, mais l'ambiance est relax, le service rapide et les prix sont très abordables. Malgré une cuisine qui manque de raffinement, je le recommande aux amateurs de bouffe rapide asiatique."}
{"text":"If someone ever asked me where they can eat authentic good korean food? I'd always answer Ganadara! But be prepared to run into a lineup since this restaurant is near a University and close to downtown.  My favorite is their Bulgogi (Beef) Ramyun, amazing spicy ramen! If it's your first time eating korean food, I'd suggest the classic Bibimbap (Rice with seasoned vegetables, sunny side-up egg and usually beef), it's a great way to introduce korean cuisine and also their spices (optional chili pepper paste, I can't handle spicy food but IT'S SO GOOD!).   Not only that but if you're not too hungry, their Kimbap's (Rice rolls) are amazing snack sized bites or you can go with Tteokbokki which are rice cakes and fish cakes dipped in a spicy sauce!  My only downside tothis restaurany is the restricted small area they have and the lineups on weekends (But hey, everyone wants to eat amazing food!)"}
{"text":"It was my first time eating here after their renovation and I honestly have to say it was hands down, the best korean restaurant I've ever been to (Amongst 2-3 others).  Just a quick description of what their food is like, it's kind of a korean restaurant that serves regular korean dishes and some of it with a twist.  Despite the waiting line of 20 minutes + ish (which was worth it and expected because the food is so good), the service/workers were very nice and friendly. It's not really a huge restaurant, but it still felt pretty nice.   I went with my sister (who has already been there and loves their bulgogi), and the waitress asked us if we minded sharing a table with two other people. We were okay with it, but it still felt kind of awkward. Their menu has some images to help you know what some food are/look like, but not all of them had an image. It also has a description of what some of the food consists of and whether it's spicy, vegetarian or semi-vegetarian.   The fact that it was my first time, I kinda knew what I already wanted (Rabboki) due to other reviews and pictures, but I still wanted to make sure that my dish was what I wanted, so I asked the waitress and she kindly told me what it was. After ordering, a table for 2 was available and one of the waiters asked us if we were okay to sit there, obviously we were okay with it and felt better. After switching places, we were given menus 3 times from the three waiters (including the one that took our order) which was kind of funny because they didn't know/weren't sure if we already ordered. I thought to myself that that was pretty much good service because they wanted to make sure that all their customers were served and I understood that it kind of confused them since we changed places.   Anyway, the wait for our food was probably 15 minutes, which didn't really bother me since the food was GREAT! :)"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this small spot with no sign so I had to go try it out on this cold April night. Parking isn't too bad around that area just bring some change for the meters, we waiting about 45 min outside for a table. It was worth the wait that's for sure. The place is tiny, most of your basements are probably bigger then this place, that doesn't mean there food doesn't have huge flavour.   We started off with some apps, 5 vegetable and 5 pork fried dumplings and there friend chicken in there special sauce....... the friend pork wontons had a lot more flavour then the veggie ones, both tasted good but the chicken.... THE CHICKEN WAS PHENOMENAL, it had a light crispy batter and the sauce was a sweet and sour/spicy sticky sauce... wow I would have it again right now!  We also order 2 orders of ramen, one with chicken and one with beef. Both tasted amazing, both spicy, spicy as in makes your nose run while your eating it. The portions are massive, 1 soup would have been enough for 2 people, it alright we brought home left overs!! We left there nice and full and he bill was very reasonable for the amount of food we had. I would definitely  want to go back and try there other amazing dishes.  The only issue is this place is pretty small and it gets really cramped in there especially when your sitting on the side seating near the walls. But still, very enjoyable dinning experience and the service was quick and friendly, can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"So. Good. Go. Now. Be. Warned. Line. Up.  Delicious, filling, and cheap. Great place to grab a bite with friend, solo if you're hungry, or casual date."}
{"text":"I like the food here but not that much. I think this place is a bit overrated. Or most Montrealers dont know where to find small restaurant like this so they all crash here or waiting in a queue."}
{"text":"My go-to Korean food joint in Montreal. Their pork belly soondubujiggae is to die for! The lineup gets pretty long during dinner time, we usually have to wait for about an hour."}
{"text":"Nous sommes allé un vendredi à 4 vers 18:30, beaucoup d'attente. Il y avait file à l'extérieur, petit restaurant avec beaucoup de table pour 2 donc plus long pour 4 personnes et plus. Une fois à l'intérieur, le service à été rapide et comme c'était notre première fois pour de la nourriture coréenne nous avons essayé plusieurs choses. Pas déçu du tout c'était excellant !! Le prix était très bien pour les portions  nous avons ramené plusieurs take-out"}
{"text":"Supperr bonn!!! Les portions des soupes sont comeme petite par contre je recommande les \" sushis \" au thons épicés"}
{"text":"My friend and I expected a lot from this restaurant, having to wait for around 45 minutes outside in the blizzard just for a seat. Ganadara did not disappoint us.  I ordered a poutine with rice cake & chicken and a plate of tuna kimbap. This fusion of Korean and Montreal food seemed weird at first but is absolutely amazing once I tried it. Along with its satisfying price (~9$), it was really filling. The tuna kimbap was ordered in case the meal wasn't enough for me, but I was wrong. The tuna kimbap might not be special, but it is worth ordering.  Overall, this is a great place for a nice dinner with friends."}
{"text":"This is straight up the best Korean place in Montreal. Food is very fresh and service is fast. What more can you ask for? Did I mention I'm Korean.....? :)) The fact that there is always a line up gives you an idea of how good the place is."}
{"text":"Great korean in Mtl. Based on my travel in South Korea I can attest to the good food of Ganadara. It is inexpensive and represents well SK"}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I ordered not really typical Korean food that I usually eat, so it was just so so. The fish cake soup, everybody can make their own. It took us at least thirty mins to wait outside, and another thirty mins inside  Went there again today and had their dinner special poutine and chicken cheese katsu. The poutine was an amazing combination of Korean food and our beloved cheese and frites, but the katsu was flavorless and the side salad were made without thoughts and efforts. WARNING: Never be too greedy to order the amount beyond u can eat, or else you'll be too full to walk even a few mins"}
{"text":"Ganadara is the best place for Korean food in Montreal. While there is always a line-up, it is definitely worth it. If you come alone or as a couple, the wait shouldn't be too bad, but groups of 3 or more need to be patient. However, once seated, you get your food very quickly and service is overall great. Prices are super reasonable and they have an alcohol licence. I recommend taking about 3 plates for 2 people. Only downside is the place could be bigger!   My personal favourites are the tteokbokki (they have a crazy cheese version) and the bulgogi kimbap!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the location is great. What is even better is that they now serve alcohol!! Open later than ever and the recent renovation made the former cutesy place modern and sleek. Maybe not worth the trek all across town but you won't be disappointed if you drop by when you're in the area."}
{"text":"Restaurant coréen qui connaît une vague de popularité. Pas étonnant avec son menu (qui inclut des mets végétarien) alléchant. On y vas pour une bouchée mais on se retrouve à commander deux ou trois plats de plus car tout à l'air trop bon! Places limitées donc il faut s'attendre à faire la queue durant l'heure de pointe. Le service est rapide et courtois donc ce n'est pas un problème."}
{"text":"This place is almost always lined up out the door and there is definitely a reason why. The food is delicious! The modern and creative Korean food is served in nice dishes and are presented in a very visually appealing way. The staff are friendly and helpful and only laugh slightly when I ask for cutlery after failing miserably to use chopsticks. There are flat screen TVs playing Korean music videos which are fun and entertaining to watch. Whenever I go there, I mostly order the seafood ramyun which never disappoints! I've tried many other dishes but I would definitely recommend that.  Food 5/5 Service 5/5 Value 5/5 Atmosphere 5/5"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant with really high expectations only because it is talked about all the time. The food was good, and the prices were good. I got the chicken cheese tonkatsu, and although it was good, it was really one note. The rice cakes are AMAZING, I'm drooling thinking about them."}
{"text":"Their tonkatzu is to die for! And it's very affordable!"}
{"text":"It isn't my first time and it won't be my last time. This isn't your traditional korean restaurant, it's new modern korean food.  It's cozy place that offer very tasty food. Korean food are mostly spicy and sweet. GaNaDaRa offer exactly that.   Bolgugi beef, fried chicken, kimchi soup, korean style sushi, fishball soup.  My all time favorite is their dak ball, it's fried boneless chicken with a sweet and spicy sauce (I call it korean general tao chicken lol)"}
{"text":"Lines are super long, but worth the wait. It's a nice but small place. Food is pretty good but a lot of hype this place too much. Basically a trendy food spot."}
{"text":"Pros -Tasty foods -Quantity  -Not so expensive  -Various choices  Cons -Small place. Must wait at lunch & dinner time."}
{"text":"Ganadara is one of the better Korean restaurants in Montreal, but i still can't justify giving them 4 or 5 stars. I've been to quite a few Korean restaurants and one of my favorite thing about them is the little appetizers. Sadly Ganadara doesn't provide that, just the two types of kimchi. Food wise, I thought the tofu soup wasn't as hot as it could be, but the bimbimbap was delicious. I would recommend coming early to avoid the line-up and order the tobboki poutine. The poutine is one of my favorite dishes from Ganadara."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed it. The wait outside was about 20 mins, well worth it. We had the grilled chicken bibimbap in stone pot and the regular minced meat bibimbap. We also had the Korean version of sushi with bulgogi filling. Loved the bibimbap. It's pretty healthy fare. The regular bibimbap needed some Kim chi to hit the spot for me but my grilled chicken was spot on. The 'sushi'  was delicious. Everything is fresh. Service is fast."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée plusieurs fois et ai apprécié à chaque fois. Le poulet croustillant avec sauce qui goûte un peu le BBQ est tout simplement trop bon, et j'aimerais le prendre à chaque fois. L'escalope de poulet pané était aussi super bien cuite et pas sèche. Par contre l'accompagnement n'avait pas beaucoup d'intérêt selon moi. La salade avec du poulpe (je crois?) ressemblait à une salade italienne un peu banale. Bonne mais dommage de prendre ça dans un restaurant. Le boeuf sur riz était vraiment bon: riz avec du goût, viande très tendre et goût assez incroyable. Petit hic: attention sweet tooth people! ils n'ont pas de dessert malheureusement... Prix très acceptables Tout le temps de la ligne pour rentrer!!"}
{"text":"The food is great however there's almost always a line and I really wouldnt line up for it if I weren't craving for some good comfort food or a place (with a great vibe) to grab grub with the squad.   I loved the bibimbap, tsunami ddukbokki, the curry katsu. This set of three is quite a lot and will fill you up quickly, so come with a friend or a second stomach."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant 3 times, and Everytime I went the food was excellent and consistent, and that's what makes a 5 stars place. The service is quick attentive and clean."}
{"text":"They changed their menu a lot thru the time and renovate the place (I prefer the cute wallpaper and all back in the days). The place is always packed at peak hours and the lineup can be quite insane. I like their bibimbap in general, but I also like some of their original dish such as the Korean style poutine. Anyway it's convenient to go there if you are around downtown, so try it out!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Korean restaurant!! If you ever see no line in front of the restaurant, there are only two possibilities. One, it's not opened. Two, you are so lucky. The food is delicious! The service is quite good. The price is nice too. You can even order by phone and pick it up in the restaurant or use food delivery service."}
{"text":"My favourite Korean joint in MTL!  I am a huge fan of their Dak(grilled chicken)Ramyun! It's the best ramyun you'll find in the city.   I've also tried their chicken bibimbap in a sizzling bowl. Fabulous stuff!  Their Dak balls are yum too!   There will most likely be a queue to be seated!!"}
{"text":"Solid. Bibimbap is very good- I love the spicy tuna roll and the Pork rolls. Here is the trick with this place there can be a mad line up and it so unpredictable - if you live near by call your order in they make it it 10 mins and pick it up !!!"}
{"text":"Service: The service was okay. The restaurant was in a bit of a rush so our waiter seemed impatient to take our order, which is normal. Also, the waitresses did not seem to notice when my glass of water was empty, I had to ask her for more water, which is okay, the problem was that she forgot me. Because it was no longer a rush when she forgot me, I cannot say that the service was good. Except from that, everything else was okay. Score: 3.5/5  Food: It was my first time coming back since the renovations, and my friend told me that the food was a bit different. Indeed, the menu changed, and prices went up, which was expected. My friend and I ordered the seafood ramyun, the dak ball and the bibimbap in a stone bowl. Honestly, I believe that the ramyun is not that different from the dried noodles we find in groceries. The dak ball (fried chicken with a sweet sauce) was really good, as always. And the bibimbap was good also. I highly recommend to pay the extra 1$ for the stone bowl, I find it way better. Score: 4/5  Ambiance: The restaurant is really small and there is a screen playing KPOP MVs. In general, the ambiance is nice, but I prefer the way it was before the decoration, it simply felt a bit more cozy. Score: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"The food is alright but definitely not the best Korean food you can find. It is trendy and cheap but if you are looking for authentic Korean food it is not."}
{"text":"C est la place où tu peux t'en mettre plein la panse et regarder de la Pop coréenne hilarante.  Des assiettes copieuses et délicieuses qui me transforme en petite barrique prête à roulée jusqu'à chez moi."}
{"text":"Get the dak balls! Great Korean food in the heart of Montreal. Don't be discouraged by the line outside since it's quite fast. Very affordable and perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"Great Korean food. Delicious bimbimbap? forget the spelling, but really tasty. Small place with fast service and nice environment. Long.line right after we come in.Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The tofu soup tastes really weird. My friend ordered the bibimbap, and it didn't taste good either. I don't understand why there's a long line in front of this place. Will never come back again."}
{"text":"I've been in Montreal for about a year now & this is the one of the really few places that are in my go-to list. Love love love the ramen here! The chicken cheese Katsu is really nice too but it's the ramen that makes me go back to this place again & again. It's pretty spicy though so maybe but too suitable for people who can't eat very spicy food, but if you like spicy food, you'll love the ramen here. Don't forget to add cheese on it though!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We had the ramyun and its so flavorful and yummi. I specially loved the egg inside. We were lucky because we came early for lunch and we found a table but within minutes there was a line up. Tables clear out quickly tho."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a very small restaurant with a more modern look. Usually there is a wait time because of its popularity but I think its worth it. There's also a TV mounted in the restaurant so you can watch k-pop while enjoying your meal.  FOOD: To me, Ganadara is my go-to for Korean comfort food. Their food is always packed with flavor. I would not recommend their Tobboki Tsunami because it is SO heavy and it wasn't that tasty. I didn't even want the rest of my food. But I do love their ramyuns and spicy tuna kimbap. Beware though, their broth is pretty spicy and usually leaves me with a stomach ache but I still go for it anyways! Highly recommended.  PRICE: Very affordable prices since it is in a student area, even after the renovations.  SERVICE: The service is always very good."}
{"text":"Did not get to take pictures but this place is doing everything right. No matter what you try you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Eum, not sure if it's my poor choices or I'm just not a huge fan of korean food, but I've visited GaNaDaRa three times, picking three different dishes.  On my first visit, I had the squid dub bap. I liked the taste and presentation, but after 5 spoonfuls, I felt like all the grease from the fried food (veggies and squid) was just too much --  I couldn't finish the plate. Also, I was disappointed that it was mostly fried carrots and rice with very few squid.  The second time, I had the supreme poutine. Yes yes yes, you're gonna tell me i asked for it -- well it's too late now, but ordering poutine in an asian restaurant really wasn't a fantastic idea on hindsight: mixing kimchi, seafood, and rice cakes with cheese and fries must be the work of a maverick. Never in my life have I had so many contrasting flavors disagreeing with half the others in 1 dish.   I noted the fries were particularly crispy on the outside, and fluffy on the inside. The grilled chicken and bugolgi were also very tasty. I didn't like the other ingredients.   And so I came back a third time, for grilled chicken. This time, I got the dak dolsot bibimbap. The flavors were diverse and appropriately balanced, but it lacked salt. And more chicken would have been better.  I'm still not an expert in Korean cuisine, but I'm rating this 4/5 for the helpful staff, generally decent food, and k-pop atmosphere.   Do yourself a favor and not a Supreme Poutine."}
{"text":"This place is seriously horrible, and let me explain why.   We ordered 3 bibimbap and item X (forgot its name). Waited almost half an hour for the food to come. Even the table came later then us got their food way before us. They ordered bibimbap too.   For the item X, I told them to make it less spicy. However, look at the picture, do you really think they are less spicy? At least my tongue is telling me they are hella spicy. I complained to the server to exchange the item. However, they refused to do so. The reason is that's already the minimum spicy they can make it. And since we already ate some of it, they cannot accept a return. ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?!????!!!!? The whole plate is all red and it tastes spicy AF, you tell me you can't make it better? And if we don't taste it, how do we know it is too spicy?   Then the server asked if there is anything he could do to make the situation better. Oh well, you are not remaking it, or taking it back, how do you think you can make the situation better? Mix in water to dilute the spiciness or what?   At the end, they offer us a discount on the item X. They left us no choice but to accept the discount and keep the item X that we don't eat.   When the check come, oh well, $2.25 of the original $15 item X. we paid $12.75 + tax for an item that would end up going to the trash.   The story hasn't end yet. When we got home, 2 out of the 3 of us had a diarrhea. The only thing we had in common was eating the bibimbap and drinking the water here.   Would definitely not come back again. And I urge you to stay away for safety reason."}
{"text":"Good good at good prices, the poutine is top notch, I think my only issue is the lack of seasoning on some dishes but it's delicious and you will wait in line"}
{"text":"I love the food here-- and the price is very reasonable. I would eat here at least 2x a week if I could! Go early to avoid lines (15-20min wait during peak hours) or order take out and only wait 15mins. The chicken curry dish and the Korean style sushi rolls are my favourite. Delicious."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Ganadara and I found myself back the week after! Such delicious food. My favourite was the vegetable ramen. So hearty! Inexpensive as well."}
{"text":"Heard about the Korean Fusion food and had to try this place because NYC has a ton of Korean food and I had to see if it was on par with my standard. I got the tteokbokki poutine and half a bulgogi kimbap and I have to say the tteokbokki poutine was really good! The sauce was on point and for some reason, all the fries I've had in Canada are super good? However, I think the shredded cheese should definitely be replaced with cheese curds because the cheese strings kind of get lost or are a lil nonexistent. The bulgogi kimbap is also a lil lackluster but all in all, I'm quite glad I tried this place."}
{"text":"Sometimes, the most enjoyable experiences in life are those where you have no expectations, no conceived ideas of what's about to come. On a lazy weeknight, my wife and I decided to go for Korean food. She proceeded to yelp for a restaurant and found Ganadara. She loved the pictures that were posted but I refused to look at them. Too often have I been disappointed in Korean restaurants in Montreal.  The first thing you will notice is that the restaurant is very cheery: Kpop music blaring, cute decals and a very helpful waitress. The food is not fancy at all but oh so satisfying: We had the seafood pancake (tasty but not too much seafood), spicy Ramyun noodles with beef bulgogi (yes, the packaged ramen noodles) and a dish of fried chicken with sweet and spicy sauce (reminiscent of a Korean General Tao chicken). The ramen was served in the pot it was cooked in and was placed atop a folded paper towel (which served as a table mat). I've never seen this before and it just put a smile on my face.  The total bill came to a ridiculous 18$ and also included a side of kimchi and dessert (steamed bun with red bean paste)! Again oh so satisfying! I will definitely go back!  PS: Wear warm clothing. I don't think they have heating in the restaurant!"}
{"text":"One of the best korean restaurant in Montreal! It doesn't seem very traditionnal but it is so unique and good! It's quite small and you have to expect a line outside but it's definitly worrh it. It is something I crave now very often !"}
{"text":"Fantastic place and one of my go-tos in MTL. Their lines are well-deserved and, thankfully, they usually move reasonably quickly. I try to make sure I have some podcasts and a game on my phone while I wait.  As crazy as it sounds, I LOVE getting ramyun here. It's not just instant noodles! They seem to make their broth in-house - the staple, Korean anchovy and kelp broth, but made spicier with the ramyun flavouring. It's very flavourful and more complex than just flavour packet + water, which is what most people do at home. I've enjoyed the seafood one, and the pork belly version is alright. The seafood is sweeter and enhances the broth, though of course, it's not going to be fancy seafood - it's probably from one of those frozen seafood medley packs. But still very good. I liked it better than the pork belly, because the pork belly is very thinly sliced and just boiled instead of grilled/torched, like I was hoping. Also, I always, always add cheese. So good.  The dak balls are tasty, with a light batter that stays crisp through most of the meal, but it's a lot if you're eating alone and to be honest, it reminds me of fake Asian food like at Manchu Wok. I mean, it's much better than fake Asian but it reminds me of that. Plus the batter can be a touch thick.  Their fried tofu is amazing, in a slightly spicy and sweetish soy sauce, with bonito flakes. This is my appetizer/side dish of choice.  I'm planning on trying the dak galbi over rice, because it's one of my favourite Korean dishes - but I can never seem to not order ramyun when I'm here!"}
{"text":"Ok so I've been to Ganadara many times and I love that they focus on making Korean street food rather than the typical Korean BBQ at most Korean restaurants in Montreal.   That said,  I think there is way too much of a hype around this place. It is good,  I will go if I want something good and fast but I don't think it's worth the long wait!"}
{"text":"Superbe découverte récente! Le typique trou dans le mur, bien chaleureux avec nombre très limité de place et souvent une file d'attente! Il y a un tableau au mur avec le menu écrit en coréen et en termes anglais difficile à comprendre.  Ne vous en faites pas, ils vous fournissent avec un gros menu rempli d'images!!! Donc ce que vous devez absolument essayer: Cheese ramyun, ça a l'air pas si appétissant mais croyez moi ce l'est! Deux tranches de fromages 'singles' déposées sur des nouilles ramen résistantes à la perfections sous la dent et un bouillon débordant de saveur avec une légère note de piquant! Si vous êtes amateurs de friture, allez avec le Dak Tuluym, 5 pilons de poulet frits avec une salade de chou au milieu et accompagnée de deux sauces sucrées. Menoum! Leur plat de riz et de calmar est également excellent! Encore une fois garnie d'une sauce épicée, le calmar est sautée et est parfaitement tendre. Et le riz coréen est vraiment savoureux! Finalement, il y a toujours le dolsot bibimpap qui est un incontournable! Servi dans un bol en pierre chaude, le tout crépite pendant tout le long du repas! À la fin, une belle croûte croustillante se forme avec le riz au fond du bol... oh la la! Le riz est accompagnée de boeuf et légumes ainsi qu'un oeuf plat sur le dessus qu'il faut crever et mélanger avec la sauce rouge afin de délivrer le bonheur! Ahhhhh! Et pour finir sur une autre note positive, c'est vraiment très abordable! Tournant aux alentours de 5 à 12$ par plat, on peut s'en sortir facilement rassassié à 15$ par personne!"}
{"text":"Pour le gout des assiettes je reviendrai mais l'endroit est un peu tassé et ca fait la file souvent. Service rapide quand meme."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Korean restaurant! Everything is so delicious and the prices are super reasonable! I would recommend dak ball and beef stew."}
{"text":"omgggggg so my clothes collected all the smells of the restaurant, especially sitting next to the kitchen. But it is truthfully delicoiussssssssssss here. I cannot help but order the same, same, same Bulgogi Ramyun for its freaking hot and flavourful soup. Tasty noodles and sweet beef.  I find the fried chicken balls to be a little boring and bland, the sauce wasn't THAT great. It's tastes like kung pao chicken for me, I apologize.   Their rice in stone pot is soooooo good though. I can eat my Ramyun and also my friend's rice, and probably still stand up. Okay maybe not fully stand up because the food is filling. Both the soup noodles and bibimbap have an egg each.  Good and quick service. It's busy always. Visit before 12, or visit before 5. Otherwise the lineups are long and messy!! Good luck!  The hours are SO CONFUSING! They are opened at 11:30am not 10:30am, that's true. But closing times seem inconsistent."}
{"text":"Très bon, Bon service, pas cher, grande quantité et bonne qualité. Petit resto, très souvent bondée"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat cheap in this part of town. I highly recommend the Dak ball, and if you're really hungry, the tteokbokki tsunami. Everything here is a deal in my opinion, and is great on a budget. They also do take out if you call ahead. If you come here to sit, they have limited table space and you can end up waiting a long time outside if you're not early or if you have a large group (more than 4). The ambiance is hip and there's kpop playing there, which can be off putting for conversation but is generally fine. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I dont know why this restaurant has a good review. So bland menu with bland taste. Huge disappointment.."}
