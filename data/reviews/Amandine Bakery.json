{"text":"Bought a red velvet birthday cake. This was the worst cake ever...absolutely disgusting! Had kids take one bite and toss the rest in the garbage! I wouldn't even given them the one star"}
{"text":"Bought a small gluten-free birthday & it was awesome. Great service, great price & great cake. Cool little cafe-bakery, will have to go back for a Jamaican Beef patty or sandwich from the deli. Highly recommend for preordering specialty cakes for special occasions. Thank you"}
{"text":"I've ordered a few times from here. 3D bday cakes. If you have an idea or picture of what you like your cake to be they can make it almost identical. I ordered a strawberry cake (real fruits) wasn't that sweet, just perfect texture.  And I also tried the double dark chocolate which was very sweet and rich, but good also :)  price is reasonable. Haven't tried their pastry yet..."}
{"text":"Ordered my wedding cake from here for my August 2014 wedding. Cake was delicious and the price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"I bought a carrot cake as a birthday cake.  The cake was dry and tasted stale.  The woman behind the counter said that the icing was cream cheese but it was butter cream and bland at that.  I definitely will not be buying another  cake at this bakery, especially for the price."}
{"text":"This bakery just does not make the grade.  I bought an apple strudel there last year, and I only ever ate one piece of it and the rest just molded away in the fridge; it just did not taste yummy like a bakery product should.  I think she needs to find a better recipe, one that makes you want to have another piece, at least!  And why can't they make a chewy chocolate chip cookie?  If I want a crunchy cookie I can get that at any grocery store, a bakery has no biz selling crispy choc chip cookies!  And where are the peanut butter cookies?  Shortbread cookies?  All the good bakeries and independent biznesses are in the SW, Killarney and thereabouts.  :("}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place at all. The website talks about how the staff are friendly and helpful. I called in and was very rushed. The guy on the phone wasn't willing to answer any questions and when I even asked for a bigger sized cake, he said it was not possible. Yet the website clearly shows sizes and prices.  I needed a cake for an adult birthday party we were having. The cake itself wasn't good at all! I ordered a double chocolate and it was very very dry on the inside. I will never come here again."}
{"text":"Having graced our city 31 years ago, Amandine Bakery & Pastry won my heart and tastebuds in the matter of seconds.  Famous for their European style sweets (Dutch almond cake, apple Kunchen, peasant loaves, Socital breads, pastries and layer cakes), this place is often a central hub in the Dover area.  What I especially love about this place is how festive it is! Celebrating the holidays in full force, Spring brings home-made Easter chocolates, and Vienna cookies filled with jam, while Christmas brings Buche de Noel, gingerbread houses, almond rings and marzipan!  Whether you're stopping in for a coffee and dessert, or dropping by to pick up some frozen puff pastry to take home, Amandine Bakery is a true delight."}
{"text":"We order our monthly birthday cake for work from Amandine and it is always amazing. They use real cream, the icings are not too sweet and also use real fruit. I'm ordering one right now for my birthday.  I've actually never been into the shop to deal with the service issues mentioned in previous reviews, but if the rest of the products are half as good as their cakes, I'll will be stopping in to see for myself. I should mention that the delivery is slightly inconsistent. We do ask that the cake be delivered 4 hours before we actually need it because they have not delivered the cakes on two separate occasions. We ensure we call ahead two days before and if the cake hasn't arrived within an hour of our expected delivery, we are on the phone looking for an answer. Great products, service could be more consistent."}
{"text":"I ask Birthday Boy: \"2 weeks till your birthday! What kind of cake do you want?\"   Birthday Boy: \"A cake with almond fondant.\"  Me: \"Uhh, what? Almond cake? What? I dont understand.\"  Birthday Boy: \"No, almond fondant. Like, a cake covered with almond paste. Fondant. But almond.\"   ...And here I thought Birthday Boy would ask for a chocolate cake with chocolate icing and we could go to Crave and call it a day. Where was I going to find almond fondant cake in the bakery-barren city of Calgary?!?   Thanks to Lionel C for coming to my rescue and recommending Amandine Bakery. Off I went to check it out and place my order.   Small shop in random strip mall on Centre Street. They had a ton of baked goods on display, but looked like their specialty was cakes, because they had a bunch of styrofoam molds of different sizes showing what say, a 10\" square cake would look like,  an 8\" round cake would look like, etc. Pretty handy. They even had a cake order sheet where I could choose my flavour amongst a bunch of really unique flavours (Oreo, irish cream mousse, hazelnut, etc!), choose my toppings, write down special requests etc. The almond fondant option wasnt on the sheet, but the lady at the counter confirmed that they would be able to do it. She was not ultra friendly or talkative and kind of looked at me like I was an idiot when all I asked how they were going to decorate the cake. Oh well. Just give me my almond fondant coated cake dammit.   I picked up my super customized delicious looking cake with no problems, and dealt with a more pleasant lady this time. We just tried the cake yesterday, and it was awesome. Birthday Boy loved it, I loved it, everyone else loved it, and I cant wait to eat the leftovers today.   Just in case you're wondering what my genius cake-ordering skills came up with, I ended up ordering a Chocolate Grand Marnier cake with almond fondant icing. YUM!!!   (3.75 stars. 0.25 stars taken off due to grumpy lady at the counter when I put the order in.)"}
{"text":"Great bakery!! Cinnamon buns are really good and the custom made cakes are great. Lots of great things to choose from."}
{"text":"So disappointed.I mostly products are small and not cheap...I bought chocolate eclairs and cream puffs mmmmm.fruits tart was good!! Meat pie was  good but sausage roll was disappointed.I will never come back."}
{"text":"We dropped by on a Saturday afternoon while waiting for our car to be maintained. We had a pretty poor experience at the Tim Hortons down the road and thought a bakery might be able to redeem our spirits. Sadly no, the coffee was ok. And the sausage and Shepards pie rolls were just ok. It seemed like a lot of people were ordering custom cakes and pastries which may be their specialty, but for a quick coffee and a bite, I would say go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I ordered my wedding cake from Amandines and went with the Mille-feuille. This cake is so amazingly delicious the entire cake was eaten and I got many compliments on how good it was."}
{"text":"I could not be more disappointed with this bakery. I ordered a Raspberry Charlotte cake for my baby's first birthday.  My baby is unable to have chocolate and nuts, and I made that very clear to the owner when I ordered the cake over the phone. He assured me that I need not worry because he would personally see to it. When I got there and was shown the cake, it ended up being a white chocolate cake. The icing looked unfinished because they looked unevenly spread and there were lots of smears on the cardboard base that the cake sits on. Even one side of the perimeter icing was unfinished. It was worse shape than a cake that I had put together at home. The cost of it was over $50. The owner immediately offered to make another cake for me, but I refused and walked away. My baby did not have a proper cake for her first bday. :( By the way, the Raspberry Charlotte looks nothing like the picture on their website. It did not have any lady fingers and it looked like a normal cake from Safeway except more recklessly finished."}
{"text":"Was so disappointed in the cake I got for my sisters birthday. First of all when I  went to pick up the cake I was told they didn't have my order, which shocked me as I had called in a few days prior. Then they told me to wait, maybe some miscommunication on their end. Finally got the cake, it was a a vanilla layered cake.  There was literally no cake!! A thin layer of cake, I think the just cut the layer in half and the rest was icing. It was literally all icing!  No one at the party liked the cake at all... I mean it was gobs of icing. It went in the garbage. I felt so bad. So disappointed, and the cake was not cheap. I am so unhappy with this bakery, I will not recommend it. Buyer beware!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best strudel in town. (Sorry Grandma!)  I visit Amandine once a week, minimum. Whether it be for a delicious cinnamon bun, a croissant (chocolate filled or not), pain au chocolat, bread (yeah they make that too), or sometimes I even stop in for lunch to enjoy a 'sub' style sandwich served on fresh baked baguette... hmm...  Amandine really is a treat that should be experienced and shared.  I recommend them to everyone.  The staff is friendly, their is usually parking, it's conveniently located (for me anyway haha) and the only negative thing I can think about is that they are closed on Mondays - oh yeah and they sometimes run out of cinnamon buns, but I usually blame myself for not getting there early enough.  The apple strudel really is the best and must be experienced to fully comprehend the joy of slightly crisp cooked apple slices wrapped up in flaky heavenly pastry.  You can buy it by the slice, or the slab - guess how I buy it?....  When I was there on Saturday, this lady came in with her 2 young kids in tow - the one kid, the son, kept shouting \"it smells like heaven in here\".  You nailed it kid.  Matthew \"Try it, you'll like it\""}
{"text":"I always get my cakes from Amandine.  The quality of the cakes is always superior.  My fave cake is Bavarian Fruit Cream.  The lightest of sponge cake with custard in the middle and on the top, it's covered with real fruit and real whipping cream!!  I'm telling you this cake won't last long.  I've also had the Double Chocolate.  It's quite decadent and the icing is not too sweet.    The other baked item I love at Amandine is their sausage rolls.  You can get them hot or cold.  6 of them for $7.75.  Very good deal!  They are huge sausage rolls and the meat in the rolls has a little spice in them.  Have them with a little soup or salad and there you have a light meal in front of you!"}
{"text":"Best Bakery in the north. Amandine is my go-to place when I have a large order. They are reasonably priced, accomodating, and delicious! I recently ordered breakfast for 100 people. I was able to customize their pre-set catering trays so I could have more sausage rolls and more pain au chocolat. They were also honest with me when it came to their cheese/meat tray, that what I required would be best to get at a grocery store rather than from them. I had 4-5 trays heaping with baked goods, and all for well under $200. Good luck feeding 100 people for less than that, and that included hearty sausage rolls too! Also, we ordered my daughter's birthday cake from here, and I was SUPER impressed. What did she want? Strawberry with green icing. In January. Good greif! No problem, Amandine told me. They made a 4 layer strawberry shortcake with green whipping cream. It tasted like summer, it was not too sweet and not too heavy....in other words, absolutely perfect. And it was more than enough to feed 10 little kids and their parents for way less than any other customized cake I'd priced out in the city. I will keep coming back again and again. :)"}
{"text":"When I was a little girl, one of my favourite things to do was stop at a bakery in Leduc with my mom and come home with a tray of apple strudel. Many of you know just how much I LOVE my apple pie, but strudel, oh my goodness... over the moon for a tray of bakery quality apple strudel.   Today was the first time I ever set foot in Amandine... and can you guess what I found? Oh my goodness, I'm a little girl all over again... all I'm missing is my mom to buy the strudel for me (don't worry, she's alive and well, she just doesn't live anywhere near Calgary!)  I stared at the rest of the baked goods here for darn near 10 minutes trying to decide what to bring home. Do I do a slice of apple strudel? A piece of chocolate cake? A strawberry tart? A pizza bun? A French loaf? It kind of made me wish I had already invited some friends over to hang out for the weekend, because I wanted to buy a little bit of everything.  But a Yelper can only eat so much while it's still fresh and still fit into her Friday night pants-this girl went for the whole tray of apple strudel and a couple of pizza buns. I know, I showed amazing self-restraint.  I'm two slices in. Good luck getting me to share... unless you have some fabulous ice cream to bring me.  PS... Amandine also does dairy-free, gluten-free, eggless or reduced sugar cakes if you're looking for any. Oh, and creme caramels."}
{"text":"I visited Amandine for the first time this past week and I think I've been missing out.  I was very impressed with the selection of baked goods and ordered a birthday cake, which I helped to eat last night.  It was the New York Style Cheesecake with Bumbleberry topping and a birthday message on a chocolate slab.  It was perfect.  I would order cake from here again and will have to stop by more often.  I'm particularly interested in trying the massive cinnamon sticks.  28/30 for Yelp's 30 Day Challenge"}
{"text":"If you require the most delicious, creamy moist cake look no further than Amandine Bakery, conveniently located on Centre street close to 16th Ave.  My obsession with their cakes started when my good friend invited me to her little girls birthday party...and the rest is history.    Made with real cream and the option to have fruit nestled in the centre or a cream custard.  Be prepared to spend a bit more on this cake, anywhere from 30-45 clams depending on size, they make even larger slabs for large functions as well.  Also offered, rice paper character designs for an extra charge.  This is the reason I didn't give them 5 stars.  One of their more mature female employees (feathered hairdo, circa 1982) who happened to be there the day I wanted to order my sons cake was just so rude and crusty, I seriously would have left and ordered it else where, but how could I?  I, I mean my son, had to have this cake, it had been haunting me, I mean him, from the last birthday... I requested a design and she told me to go through a binder which had these rice paper characters.  I specifically asked for Spider man or the Cars theme, neither were in the binder.  So I asked her if they free handed the art on the cake, she said yes, but it costs more and it would be cheaper to get it in the rice paper and will fade eventually because of the cream.  I proceeded to tell her that I didn't see it in the binder and she proceeded to tell me that IT WAS IN THERE, ummm NO ITS NOT!  She got so angry that she physically took the binder from me and vigorously leafed through it to discover that in fact, it was not there.  Then she casually said \"oh, I guess someone must have purchased it.\"  No apology, nothing.  I got so mad that I said, if you can manage to just make the cake, I will get the graphic from elsewhere.  Then she went on to say they won't put the graphic on for me (not that I asked her to!) and I had to repeat that I did not want the fruit filling because most kids don't like it and it was just so unnecessary, the whole confrontation.  I really left with a bad taste in my mouth, considering all the wonderful, delicious goodies they offer.  This sour grinch should not be working in a place where all the other employees are so sweet.  I have been back, several times, the petit fours are perfect for entertaining, their loaves are fantastic, and the pastry's oh god, if I wasn't so vain, I would eat there daily.  A must try, but beware of the impatient crusty grinch lurking behind the counter."}
