{"text":"Pleasant surprise in terms of taste profile for most of what we ate- spices were beautifully balanced and meats were perfectly cooked... almost everything is good here. The only two downsides for this resto was 1. When it is very cold outside sitting near the windows is not pleasant... we were very cold until we had tea to warm up with and 2. The \"fried rice\" was way over priced and a disappointment. While everything else on our table seemed to be prepared with fresh veggies ... the fried rice obviously had been made with frozen peas and carrots added to it and cost way too much. That being said... the portions of most dishes are large and the presentation of everything else was beautifully done. Would come back for sure... we would just sit away from the window and avoid the fried rice.   Wish they would offer delivery"}
{"text":"On the fence about posting yet another positive review because now that I've been there, I don't want everyone to know how great it is! Called first but they don't take reservations for 2 people, they told us they had 2 tables open so we rushed on over. Wow! Food was miles ahead of any other local Chinese/Szechuan restaurant...on a totally different level. We had the steamed fish, salt and pepper shrimps, Dan Dan noodles and green beans with chili - all beautifully prepared, fresh, right level of spice and so delicious. Can't wait to come back with a larger group so we can try more. Also the service was great, really friendly and took an interest in helping us and making sure we enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"Just finished a fantastic meal of szechuan dumplings, stir fried green beans and shrimp with szechuan sauce. Delicious!"}
{"text":"C'est difficile de trouver un restaurant chinois authentique à Montréal. Plusieurs places, surtout dans le Quartier Chinois, offre un menu aux noms authentiques mais sans les saveurs qui y correspondent. Ici, pour la première fois, chez Gia Ba, on retrouve une sauce au chili qui nous transporte au Sichuan dès la première dégustation. Oui c'est épicé, mais c'est aussi très savoureux. Soyez sûr d'essayer leurs diverses entrées, le Ma Po Tofu, les nouilles Dan Dan (pas le même nom que la poutine homonyme à la Banquise) pour vraiment goûter à ce qu'on appelle en anglais le \"soul food\" de la cuisine Sichuannaise.  Bref, mise à part la nourriture, le service est excellent et rapide, malgré la salle pleine et la caractère indécis de notre groupe (nous étions huit, en plus).  À y retourner c'est certain!"}
{"text":"Personally don't think you should review a place if you haven't eaten there...maybe that's just me...Went here, had yu xian eggplant w du ban jiang - nice sweet, smoky, maple flavour - can't say i've had anything like this; dumplings in spicy sauce - also amazing and as described with nice garlic and ginger flavour; on special we had chili soft shell crab. WOW. i'll be back."}
{"text":"This little Szechuanese/Taiwanese restaurant is one of my favourite Asian restaurants in Montréal. Asian food can either be delicate and subtle (think Japanese or Cantonese) or a firework of complex spices and tastes that will knock your socks off. Gia Ba falls in the latter category and does it very well.   Even though the menu contains some classic Cantonese dishes, it is the Szechuanese dishes that stand out for us. Our favourites include the green beans (crispy and full of flavour), the decadent and silky Yu Xiang eggplant, the cumin chicken, spare ribs and the Brussels sprouts (I usually dislike Brussels sprouts but this restaurant uses a 3-steps cooking technique that turns it in a delicious crispy and sweet and spicy dish, almost like if they were candied). In the appetizers, the mushrooms or cucumbers with nuts in a spicy home sauce are delicious and the hot and sour soup is one of the best I had. Their version of the classic general Tao chicken (in delicate and crispy panko) is one of the best I ever had, at par with l'Orchidée de Chine. There are also a few interesting Taiwanese dishes on the menu.   The decor is simple and modern, and the owners Andy and Debbie are very friendly and hospitable."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time here. I got the taiwanese beef noodle soup which was hugely dissapointing; the poached fish (amazing); the eggplant (also amazing). My dining companion said the hot and sour was great too.   Got 2 beers at $8 each  friendly and fast and accommodating service  I would give it 4.5 if I could but have to dock one star for the super mediocre soup  Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"very very bad service?the lady asks me to pay her 15% tip, also, we can find the preservative film from the dish"}
{"text":"Continuing in the tradition of his last restaurant (Cuisine Szechuan), Andy Su has finally brought great food to the overpriced, unimaginative Monkland strip.  Gia Ba is the best restaurant in the area by far.  The dumplings in chilli sauce are mind-altering.  The eggplant is almost better than sex. Almost. His fantastic Cuisine Szechuan tofu flower chicken is retooled and done with poached fish, but is as amazing as the original (which they'll do on request) Cumin beef, the original Montreal love affair, is as delicious as ever. I'm almost ashamed to admit it, but I've even tried the General Tao chicken, and it's really really yummy! Crispy and meaty."}
{"text":"Great food, quality ingredients, awesome portion/price ratio! We ordered braised beef, chicken cumin (instant favorite) and chicken with shitake mushroom (super delicious) Fried rice was great, not greasy and definitely flavorful.  Highly recommend..."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome, best szechuan in Montreal! I've been a regular for a few years and love that they actually use szechuan peppers.   The twice-cooked fish is a must, but everything on their menu is well-curated, reasonably priced and delicious. The pork belly burger, sweet and spicy eggplant, cumin beef and the pepper cabbage are all also favourites.   Well worth checking out, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Szechuan & Taiwanese cuisine in NDG? Yessir.  I have been here twice now, both times during dinner time and they are starting to get a bit busier.  My wife and I tried their Ma Po Tofu dish first and man, did it transport me back to my travels in Asia. You can tell they made their chili oil fresh here and make sure to get a bowl of rice to go along side this one.  The next dish we sampled was their Taiwanese beef noodle in soup. The beef shanks were super tender, noodles were a bit softer than I would like, but the broth helped bouy this dish back to an excellent rating,  The last dish we had was the twice cooked fish, which was pan fried first and then quickly deep fried. Lots of garlic, onions and green peppers garnish this dish with some black fungus. It's spicy. it's delicious. I think this was my favourite one.  They are licensed now, so grab a cold bottle of Kirin and enjoy some great food."}
{"text":"Decent resto in Monkland village. Really enjoy the spicy green beans.  And delicious Dan Dan noodles. Good cumin beef & 13 spice chicken w potatoes.  A solid 3 star meal."}
{"text":"Perfect. Everything  is really well done, and delicious. Far and away the best Szechuan in Montreal. Make sure you order the sliced poached fish with a gazillion chilis. The green bean and eggplant dishes are also great. OK everything is really good."}
{"text":"The food is excellent here. The service is exceptionally abrupt, cold, unhelpful, and unpleasant. Take the good with the bad, it's worth it. Probably best to take out."}
{"text":"I love this place! Excellent Chinese and Taiwanese food - anything with ma la, peppers very good. We've been a number of times, and it's a mainstay. Not for the faint of heart! Very spicy, very delicious. Gia Ba is really one of the best restaurants in Montreal, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Very good.  Cut above other Chinese food in ndg or cote st-luc.   Recomend the twice cooked fish. Prices 10-15 percent more than some.  But the quality of ingredients seem a cut above.   Taste is certainly better than the somewhat gloopy taste of other suburban Asian resto. Strange opening hours so check befre going (at this writing). Service friendly but explanations limited by some lack of eng or fr."}
{"text":"We ate here on a Friday evening, around 8:30pm. We'd called to make a reservation but they only take them for 4 or more people. We didn't however have any trouble getting a table, despite the rave reviews the place has been getting lately.  Those reviews are warranted. We started with (Chinese) Mushrooms and walnuts in Szechuan spices, which was spicy and citrusy, with succulent but springy mushrooms. The main dishes followed in rapid succession: Cumin beef (meat cooked and spiced just right), Giaba sweet and sour short ribs (you'll never want to eat BBQ sauce on your ribs again), Taiwanese radish, tofu, peanuts and celery (a mixture of crunch and softness, with tang from the pickled radish and an almost meaty taste from the tofu).  They have a good selection of drinks, with two beers on tap, including Sapporo. The service was efficient and the staff ready to help with suggestions.  We'll definitely be back but with more friends, to take advantage of the window seats and the ability to order a greater selection of dishes!"}
{"text":"We went last night, partially because of the good Yelp reviews, partially because it is 3 blocks away from our home.     I honestly left quite disappointed.  Lovely woman serving us who unfortunately had problems expressing herself easily in English or French but I won't take points away for that.  She was very nice, quick to smile and quick to apologize or offer suggestions.   The first issue - we immediately ordered a couple of Sapporo beers.    They arrived warm.    Really warm.    I called the woman over and asked if I could get cold beer or icy glasses.    She said she didn't have cold beer or cold glasses but she could bring me some ice cubes.   So that's what we had to do......put 8 small ice cubes into our beer to bring them  to a cool (not cold) temperature.   Not a great start to a nice meal.....the ice melted very quickly so now we are just drinking watery beer.  The second issue - it was 30 degrees outside and it's extremely warm in there.     Air conditioning is not really a \"nice to have\" in a Monkland Avenue restaurant that has dishes on the menu that are $40.       We looked at the menu and the seasonal menu up on the chalkboard for some time and decided on dumplings with peanut sauce, seasonal soft shell crab, an order of rice, seasonal asparagus and chicken vermicelli.    All of the food was good, not great.       The third issue - half of the restaurant looks run down, slapped together and not welcoming at all.    Extension cords haphazardly strewn across the wall, boxes of supplies stored at the front door under some really old and very ugly bit of furniture from someone's basement, very large and unattractive fridge and supplies in the dining room, angry older woman in the open kitchen in a baseball hat yelling at the staff, giant television playing The Food Network's \"You Gotta Eat Here\" as the center display of the grill and bar area, bin of peppers waiting for some staff to get to it with scissors sticking out of it in the middle of a table in the dining room.....all of it was pretty tacky.   We have no problem paying $90 for dinner for 2 (plus 2 beers) but you've got to clean yourself up a little here.  I wouldn't go back.    I would probably order takeout over the phone and go pick it up one of these days.       Gia Ba.....take a day to cover up that extension cord, put away your supplies, get rid off the television because you are not a sports bar, don't store food on tables in the dining room, put a screen up in front of the fridge and just put some nice lounge music on.      Little things go a long way  :-) ."}
{"text":"WORSE RESTAURANT EVER! DO NOT EAT HERE! Came here with a group of 8 and was told to seat at 2 different table because they can't arrange another big table just for us. Waitress gave us attitude through out the entire time we were there which is ridiculous. Service and food was horrible, do not recommend anyone to come here. As a food lover, I have been to many different restaurants in Canada, I have never encounter such bad service in my life."}
{"text":"The food is excellent! We had the beef with garlic stems, the chicken with crispy spinach and sezchuan style tiger shrimp. All were excellent. Remember to ask what the seasonal specials are, they are on a board near the door."}
{"text":"Caveat:  this is from the perspective of someone who is vegetarian/vegan.  I acknowledge that the culinary experience is different for someone eating meat or fish.  The food is, I gather, not only adventuresome but delicious.  But that wasn't my experience.  I ordered two tofu dishes.  They were both bland. B-L-A-N-D.  Neither had exciting savory seasoning.  It was frustrating -- as delicious aromas and concoctions were being served all around me. I wouldn't quite call the dishes \"hospital food\" - but it was close to it.   For transparency sake, I come from LA, where veg restaurants are everywhere, and sprouting more, and there is a concerted movement and even multiple chains to create all the dishes, comfort foods, burgers, ethnic cuisine, to fulfill the palate.  If the two tofu dishes were served in LA in vegetarian restaurants, they would be almost like the neutral side dishes, not something that would be a main course/centerpiece.    My cousin ordered a fish dish with this flavorful dark sauce, and crisp breading. I felt like I should be putting on a hospital bib for my bland fare.  Non-veg chefs unconsciously patronize vegetarians by projecting that they are satisfied grazing on greens, while they devote resources to create dynamic flavorful concoctions for meat eaters - as if we don't have the same culinary threshold.  WRONG.  My mother and I, who ordered those two tofu dishes, were extremely disappointed.  Those tofu dishes would be ho-hum yawn by food critics in LA.    As a side note to the veg bias, I specifically asked the server whether the two tofu dishes I ordered were too similar in flavor. Her response was to comment that the tofus were different, ignoring the fact that e real issue was that both had bland almost-nonexistent sauces.  Fail.   NOTE TO CHEF:  expend your same culinary skills to make tofu dishes that are dynamic. Drive down to Yuan on St. Denis and Sherbooke to see how it's done. Our taste buds aren't comatose; they're just non-animal."}
{"text":"Flavourful, spicy, garlic-y. Service was ok. Food was decent. Everything was fine but nothing stood out. Price is a bit more than what I usually pay, but I didn't feel ripped off."}
{"text":"I love everything Chef Andy cooks! The food is delicious, pristine, and just fabulous. Try the smoked duck, chicken Kon Pao, even something as simple green beans are turned into splendour!  I haven't been back to Chinatown since he arrived in NDG!"}
{"text":"Today,  I went there to take out couples plats like green been with chilli ($11), YuXiang eggplant ($10), chicken cumin ($16.75), vegetable tiger shrimps 9pieces ($17.50) total for tonight supper with tax is $63.52. The portion  is not worth the value specially chicken plat. It was only 10 small pieces of chicken, rest of the plat is full of red chilli. It is overpriced!!! Very disappointed.  The taste wise is good. But is not filling up for 4 ppl. I'm still hungry after all."}
{"text":"Excellent et dépaysant. On savais en réservant que c'était un endroit où on devrait partager les plats. Mais comme je ne suis pas habitué à ce concept, j'ai adoré l'expérience. La nourriture était excellente et goûtait différente pour ces mets que je connaissais. C'était très bon."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, but the portions a bit too small considering how expensive it was. I took my food to go so there is very little I could say about restaurant itself. Paid 40$ with barely enough food for 2 people with small appetites."}
{"text":"Gia Ba has some delicious dishes to offer. Hidden away on Monkland avenue this may not be your first choice of restaurant as it requires some good walk from the metro station, but parking is easy and the food deserves the effort.   The restaurant is more suitable for small groups unless you manage to reserve the surrounded by windows table that can accommodate ten people without a problem. The very same table is not superbly comfortable as you have to sit the entire evening on wooden benches, without back support on a thin cushion, but allowed us to have enjoyable family style dinner.  We ordered a lot of dishes and I managed to taste most of them. My five stars go to the dumplings with peanut butter sauce, the absolutely amazing mushrooms with walnuts, and the yummy Yu Xiang eggplant. The eggplant is orgasmically delicious, but beware, heavy and kind of oily dish. Four stars for the chicken with peanuts and the cumin beef (a little but overcrowded with onions, but so tender). The fried spinach was too sweet and just ok. I really wanted to try the fried green beans, crispy and delicious as expected, they blended well in the endless mix of flavours during dinner, but my last bite left an aftertaste of oil that has been used for frying a little bit more than I would like.   What a pleasure to have such an endless variety of beers from the Far East, almost every brew available in Montreal was on the beer list, including Sapporo on tap and tall bottles of Kirin.   The Gia Ba menu is long and I'm sure it is full of more surprises, good reason to stop for dinner again!"}
{"text":"Great service both times I've been there. I enjoyed everything I've eaten there so far except the chicken and mushroom dish.  It was bland."}
{"text":"Ordered for 30 people and we were amazed at the catering and delivery service given! Quality and freshness of ingredients were exceptional. Quantity of food was generous and taste of dishes brought us straight to Asia! We will definitely order again from this place."}
{"text":"Talk about yummy. We enjoyed our dining experience here, and ordered several dishes to try. Although, as Heather W. mentioned, we came on a cold winter evening and the draught from the open door every time a customer came/left was a little bit unpleasant. First off, was the beef noodle soup. A very good dish, beef was quite tender and broth was tasty. Although enjoyable, to be honest, Nudo restaurant (with fresh handmade noodles) does a better job in this department. The twice cooked fish was really savory and delicious, and the veggies also took on the wonderful flavour from the sauce. The MaPo tofu was delightfully spicy, and both dishes paired excellently with steamed rice. Prices were a bit higher than expected, but overall we thought the meal was worth the money. Great place to get your Taiwanese/Szechuan comfort food fix."}
{"text":"The third time we go there, first time 9:45 they're closed. 2nd time 9:40 there telling us they are closed we argue about closing time they still serve us. The food was very good. Third time we get there 9:30 the door is locked. Its real good chinese food but without the chinese buisness mentallity. By the way if you say you have opening hours you respect them or else what good are they for?! That's why i give it a 1 star rating. The foor was really good but we asked them for rice for two and they served us a 1 person portion of rice. You know the small ball of rice they serve you for single people.. Ne way thats all i have to say... Ho yeah a bit on the expensive side for an asian restaurant...."}
{"text":"Les critiques négatives me semblent un peu malsaines. Un concurrent frustré face a ce vent de fraîcheur qui arrive enfin sur notre rue envahie de restaurants ordinaires overpriced? Un concurrent qui vend son vin a 60$ la bouteille? Bref, j habite le quartier et mes deux visites ont été magiques. Le service est parfait, le chef vient nous voir pour avoir nos commentaires et les plats sont parfaitement réalisés avec talent. Enfin. J'y retourne chaque semaine"}
{"text":"We found this place out of desperation for chinese food and what a great find it was. I needed my spice fix and spice fix I got. As I have always said they should allow us to do half stars as this place is a 4.5 star.  Their dumplings in their home made spice was just totally amazing. WOW!!! Along with their beans and potatoe strips. Their fried dumplings were a little disappointing. They tasted frozen and not home made. Their chicken with 10 spices was also amazing. This place was so good I am going back friday."}
{"text":"Read many good reviews of this restuarant. Unfortunately after three visits over three weeks I have to say I am very underwhelmed. I will give the chef credit for using great and unusual ingredients and thinking out of the box. That being said there is a certain lack of subtlety in the flavouring of the food....one is clubbed over the head with the dominant seasoning...the Cumin-spiced lamb ...all you taste is cumin, it overpowers the other flavours there is no hint of the lamb flavour or the other seasonings...same with the Chili crawfish...just chili..nothing else. Let me be clear....it wasn't that the food was ugh..bad....it was just disappointing. Which would be fine at half the price...but this place isn't cheap...so only two stars...I can't recommend this restuarant."}
