{"text":"Great service, awesome coffee, fresh ingredients....cozy"}
{"text":"The chicken omelette was amazing.  My son had the Nutella lava crepe cake.  Need I say more?  You need to have breakfast here.  Best I have had anywhere in years."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Very good food, excellent coffee and service. The portions are huge and I love the greens that accompany breakfast."}
{"text":"Based off of other reviews, I really thought that I would love this place... unfortunately, that was not the case. I ordered the egg and cheese panini, which was not a panini at all. It was scrambled eggs and cheese on white bread. Definitely never touched a panini press. Very similar to something I make at home. Not worth $11! 
I had the sandwich with a side of fries, which I was hoping to be fresh cut - but they were frozen. Blah.  Plus, service was very slow. I waited for a menu... waited to water, which ended up being a mini bottle of water from Walmart... waited for food... never got checked on... and had to ask for my check. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This was another great find courtesy of Yelp. We figured we would end up at Denny's or Dunkin Donuts because they were both close to our hotel. Thanks to Yelp we found this little gem in a small strip mall behind Dunkin and Denny's and still in walking distance to our hotel. We were there for breakfast shortly before 9 on a Sunday morning.  I had the French toast with strawberries and it was really tasty. My husband had a western omelet and really enjoyed it. The staff was friendly and welcoming and we had very little wait time for anything. Bypass the chain places and go just a short step off the main road to get a delicious start to your day."}
{"text":"I don't normally have the time to leave reviews here on Yelp... I travel all over the US for work and have to live on restaurant food while on the road... after all the little places I've experienced... then this wonderful place ... I have to say... 

I may NEVER be happy eating breakfast again... this place was so incredibly delicious !! It has set my bar of expectations for every other breakfast place I will go next so high I fear I will not get a satisfactory breakfast again! The omelet I ordered was massive... the egg was cooked perfect ... not burned or over cooked anywhere:.. the bread... oh the bread! Soft ... lightly toasted.. warm... best toast I've ever had ... no doubt it was home made bread... because no store made bread would taste this good... thick slices... and they served my omelet with a salad which was a perfect accent to the breakfast... 

It is sad that I cannot finish the omelet... it was huge and every bite better than the last... I am in this area for one more day and you better believe I will be here tomorrow and, if I ever get the chance to return to the area, I will be here each and every day for breakfast!!

Yelp: one suggestion - allow me to leave 10 stars instead of 5 cause this place deserves every star I can give it and more that I cannot!"}
{"text":"So happy to have this new little breakfast and lunch place in our area. The breakfast food was delicious and the portions are fit for a king.  I can't wait to come back and try the lunch menu."}
{"text":"I don't know what took me so long to come here and it's in my neck of the woods! Fresh wonderful food.... got so busy after I got here! I highly recommend it... had the spinach feta cheese crepes with a salad and bacon and delicious Turkish coffee!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely  one of my best restaurants in Pittsburgh I loved the decoration the food every thing was fabulous. They might need more waiters and more working hours. Food is so delicious and yummy I can't wait to visit them again."}
{"text":"Tasty crepes and friendly staff!  Restaurant is modern and relaxing atmosphere.   And they have a great espresso machine."}
{"text":"no need an explanation!! look at the picture!! prices are really average when you compre the plates! plates are giant!!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place!  Crepes were absolutely delicious, coffee was great, service was awesome.  Can't complain about anything."}
{"text":"The owners relocated here from the South of France, so the crÃªpes salee are authentic -- and their Turkish heritage puts a neat spin on the menu. All in all, a cut way above what you'd expect to find in a mini-mall near a Target and a Denny's -- great food served by lovely people in a nice-looking space. Just a really nice breakfast spot, that's become my go-to for great crepes and omelets."}
{"text":"So good!  One of my favorite breakfast spots.  The toast, for 50 cents, is to die for!"}
{"text":"My.family had breakfast there and it was delicious! Spinach feta omelette was great with some Turkish coffee. Kids had chocolate croissants that they raved about. Lots of food"}
