{"text":"Visited this place for the first time since it opened.  This plaza has a few good options for food (Jamaican, Greek, Fish and Chips etc). It can be difficult to find a pizza place that also serves decent pasta so I was very excited to try this place.  We ordered the baked spaghetti with meat sauce to go.   It was a good sized portion, lots of sauce and cheese baked on top. Very pleased that they use fresh herbs for garnish.  The spaghetti was cooked well and a little thicker than usual (spaghettoni) which I prefer, so this was a bonus.  The sauce was well seasoned and had a good amount of meat in it.  Overall,  I am a fan and will definitely be returning to try their pizzas.  Well done Vis-a-Vis!"}
{"text":"They got delicious pizza as it reminded me of a time we had pizza in southern Italy.  The service was great and the place is quite clean as well."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza and a chicken Alfredo pasta from here through skip the dishes and it was amazing! Good quantity and quality. Would get this again."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place in Pickering. Casual dinning atmosphere with choose your own pasta.
We've ended up ordering the chicken Alfredo pasta and a small size Margherita pizza. Overall, I've found that the pasta is a bit watery and chicken is not well cooked. As for the pizza, i think putting actual tomato slices would taste a lot better."}
{"text":"After the demise of the last VPN-esque pizza joint in these parts (PIE Wood-fired) I was amazed to see somebody else try to take a shot at that market. I fully expected this to be PIE (with all its crazy pizza combinations) relaunched as fast food/takeout. But it isn't.  Not even close.  Way better.

The best way to describe Vis-a-Vis, it's Blaze/Mod Pizza without the Subway/Chipotle/Mucho Burrito style \"toppings bar\".  You choose from one of their 12 signature pizzas or create your own, they assemble it for you, and then the pizza bakes in the 1000F rotating oven imported from Italy, which has both gas and wood fire in order to get both consistent heat and the smoked flavor and avoiding having to rely on staff to keep the pizzas moving around for even cooking.  Once in the oven the pizza is done in less than 4 minutes. I believe this is the oven they have:  http://marraforni.com/products/enclosed-facade-wood-gas-fired-ovens/

The pizza was delicious, and I'd say much better than Blaze (they aren't stingy with toppings like Blaze, and you won't need to add parmesan/pepper flakes/salt, very flavorful and perfectly seasoned), however you definitely pay for it.  Pizzas start at $8.50 for a small margherita all the way up to $29 for a large Veggie Mania.  

If you feel like Blaze Pizza but don't want to go all the way downtown to Yonge-Dundas Square or don't want to pad LeBron James' bank account, give Vis-a-Vis a try.   I hope this place does better than PIE did, but going the QSR route rather than full service restaurant/bar is the right way to go."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good Pizza and pasta in Pickering this is a go to place.  Amazing comfort food"}
{"text":"I stopped in this place as I saw the signage advertising pizza from a wood oven.  Besides, the Mr. Greek next door wasn't peaking my interest.  

I ordered the New Yorker small pizza.  I was amazed that my pizza was made in 11 minutes.  The crust was done to perfection and the toppings were generous.  I am not a fan to thick crust pizzas and this one had a crust that I didn't mind eating.  

I found myself considering many pizzas off their menu and I will update my review after I have tried some of them.  

I also found the seating ample and the customer service good."}
{"text":"I am giving 3 stars to be nice because it is a different kind of pizza than I expected and has nothing to do with the quality of the pie.  
The crust is paper thin and not particularly crispy.  I just don't like that kind of pizza.
If you do, then I expect you will love it here.  
Me, not my style.  If you order \"Thin Crust\" ... I really don't know how you could get thinner because as I stated, it was not much thicker than a piece of paper."}
{"text":"I tried their Margarita Pizza and was very surprised to have such a clean, tasty pizza.  The crust was perfect.  Well cooked and not chewy.  I prefer a more woody taste but there is nothing wrong with this one.  The sauce was very well balanced.  Beautiful tomato flavour.  Cheese was flavourful and stringy.  A spicy oil for people like me to add some heat would be a great addition. 

Very much worth visiting and trying.  I'll try their homemade pasta next time.  

Leaps and bounds better than the Pie Restaurant from previous comment."}
{"text":"The pizzas are very reasonably priced and even the small size is good enough for the two of us.  We ordered the Prosciutto and Arugula pizza and it tasted so good! However, their Caesar salad is just average home-made level so we didn't fancy it too much.

The seatings are very comfortable and spacious and the inner decorations are pleasant. 

Before we leave I noticed that they have great lunch special deals. We will definitely come back next time for lunch on our day-offs."}
{"text":"Fantastic Spaghetti and Meatballs! Quick service, very friendly/accommodating staff, with food to match. It's a new place, looks nice, very clean and well maintained, including the bathroom."}
{"text":"I kinda stumbled across this place when looking for lunch after a round of golf. It's new so I had to try it. Their menu has a selection of stone baked pizzas and pastas and they have a showcase with some good looking desserts. They also sell wine and beer. Ordering and pickup is done at the counter.

I ordered the Chicken Alfredo and it was good, although I would have preferred a little more sauce. I like lots of sauce so that's probably just me. It had chunks of tender chicken and was finished with freshly cut basil. Nice.

This place looks promising. I'll have to come back to try their pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken alfredo. Fettuccine was over cooked, and alfredo sauce was pretty bland.  And then I found a hair in my meal."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from here and the food was fantastic! I got the caprese pizza, the New Yorker pizza and the casaer salad. The caprese salad was of course my favourite but everything is 5 stars - they don't skimp out on the ingredients. I ordered both pizzas as a medium and for my family of four we couldn't finish it all, it's so filling. Will definitely be ordering from here again. I also ordered through the UberEats app and it was so quick, probably 15 minutes top after placing my order."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I came here for lunch on Good Friday and it wasn't very busy. 

I think because it's quite new, not many people know about this place. 

The staff are friendly and the service is fast, but it's a tad bit pricey. We ordered 2 Margherita Pizzas and 2 Pepperoni Pizzas with 4 fountain drinks and it came out to about $48.95 or so. 

If you like thin crust neopolitan style pizza, this is the spot for you! The ingredients are definitely fresh and overall the food tastes good. 

The atmosphere is very casual, with limited seating and slightly uncomfortable metal chairs. The ordering style is at the counter and when your number is called, you go up at the end of the counter to grab your pizzas.

It's definitely good for a quick lunch or take out. I wouldn't reccomended this place for a nice sit down dinner."}
{"text":"Finally a decent pizza place in Pickering. This place is tucked away in the home depot plaza but definitely deserves more attention than what I've seen. This place is open is open and airy, but it is narrow and gets pretty hot from the stone pizza oven. 

FOOD: I ended up trying the tropical BBQ chicken pizza. Normally I'm pretty hesitant on ordering BBQ pizzas as the BBQ sauce that replaces the tomato sauce is quite sweet, but the BBQ sauce used at Vis-a-Vis is more savoury than sweet (which is a plus for me as I prefer savoury pizzas). The pineapples are actually what brings out the sweetness of the pizza. I also really enjoyed how they grated extra fresh cheese on the pizza after it comes out of the oven!! However, the chicken was the only ingredient I didn't quite enjoy on the pizza even though it's supposed to be the star of the show. The chicken ended up being thin shaved slices (kind of like a thick turkey ham) instead of chunks or thicker strips. 

Overall, a great place to go for quality pizza. Can't wait to try the rest of their menu items."}
{"text":"Probably the best tasting pizza this side of the pond. Very authentic Italian pizza. Hope they survive in this competitive market. A name change might highlight the fact they serve exceptional Italian pizza and pasta."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I drive up from downtown Toronto to eat dinner here. The pasta is FRESH and the pizza is unbeatable. I wish they would open one in the downtown core but that wont stop us from driving to Pickering for dinner. BEST pastas in the GTA."}
{"text":"So on this particular day we had actually come to this area of pickering to get some Jamaican food from Beryl's Pepper Pot which is right next door. I have always loved pizza and always game to try something new and interesting. 

So the signs outside tempted me with promises of authentic italian pizza, with pasta from Italy a wood burning oven etc. So my mouth started to water and in I went.

The decor in this place is very nice and modern. We ordered the personal size primavera pizza. They do have many interesting items on the menu which tempt me to visit again.

The pizza was excellent, so fresh, the ingredients were also fresh with generous portions.

I will definitely be coming back to this place!!"}
{"text":"I have now been here three times and it was excellent every time. You can really taste the highly quality ingredients they use and is certainly worth paying a little more for. Nothing but love inside the food; great to have some Italian flavours in Pickering!"}
{"text":"I finally came around to trying this place this weekend. Like many others I have been searching for a place to fill my void for pizza that PIE use to cater to.
The restaurant itself is quite long and narrow with two tables in the front and a few more along one side of the restaurant. FYI they also have high chairs if you want to bring the kiddies.
In addition to pizzas they serve pastas, calzones, salads, and desserts as well as beer & wine.
I was doing a take out order and picked two small pizzas to try
Margherita - Tomato sauce, Fior di latte, basil and extra virgin olive oil
Spicy Hawaiian - Spicy BBQ sauce, mozzarella, pineapple, jalapeño, and ham
What I loved about this place is that they knead the dough to order. Right before your eyes they are creating your pizza from scratch and the best part it cooks up in less than 5 minutes. I was in rush so that was amazing!
The pizza itself is surprisingly flavourful! They're tomato sauce is well seasoned and the cheeses are nice gooey. The spicy Hawaiian ended up being our favourite of the two pizzas and a real stand out as well. It is definitely spicy! I love there use of super fresh ingredients! The pizza had nice big rings of freshly cut jalapeños and I liked how they chopped up the ham into tiny little cubes so that every inch of the pizza was showered in meat. Both pizzas were garnished with a scattering of fresh chopped basil. They don't skimp on ingredients here! The only thing I can fault the pizzas on is there crust. I found it a bit chewy and was expecting more of crisp woody taste. I'm not sure if it's because I got them as take out and didn't end up eating it until 20 minutes later so I won't really fault them on that. Otherwise the pizzas themselves were both really flavourful. I guess I'll have to come back and dine in next time!"}
