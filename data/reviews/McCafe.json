{"text":"Stopped by McCafe for a McFlurry tonight. Unfortunately seven of us customers stood around waiting for anything to come through the pass. Two of the staff were huddled around an iPhone giggling. Presumably there was something else they could have been doing.  While standing around, I got to observe a staff with one glove cracking open eggs with both hands. She proceeded to take the glove off and put a new one on. She then began handling English breakfast muffins with her gloved hand, and cheese slices with her right (which had just previously been cracking eggs). Salmonella anyone?  I realize this is McDonalds. But this McDonald's with a reduced menu, at an off-peak time, with more staff than customers. A McFlurry in under 9 minutes is all I ask."}
{"text":"Affogato. What more do I need to say? :)  Since McCafé opened inside the York Concourse at Union Station, I have had the McCafé Affogato several times now. (It's only available at two McCafés in Toronto.) Oreo cookie crumbs with a scoop of vanilla soft serve, served with a shot of espresso. Mmm...   This location is also testing out McDonald's new self-order stations, which are very user-friendly. You can check out the entire menu, make changes, and enter coupon codes before paying for your order."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the most \"un-McDonalds McDonalds\" out there, and I'm counting the upscale restaurant in New York.  The words \"McDonalds\" and \"quality\" don't go together all that well, which made it a bit of a shock to encounter this upscale brand offshoot in the middle of Union Station. Although I've passed through the concourse plenty of times, I didn't have the chance to stop and try it out until yesterday - and the final results had me a bit perplexed.  This location can be best described as a Starbucks combined with a high-end fruit/snack store, yet still stuck with the trappings of the McDonalds brand. Sure, you can get your coffees and a few sandwiches like normal... or you can pick freshly-made croissants, juices or pre-packaged coffee from the front cash.  I'm so used to the chain either screwing up my drink order or just not giving a shit that the friendly employees at the cash also had me a bit confused. You can tell that brand management is king here, and the employees seem to go out of their way to greet everyone. Compare that to the original incarnation of the Union location, where you couldn't pay the staff enough to care.  Though I'm still not quite convinced with their selection of food (most of the menu isn't served, and some standard breakfast staples like the aforementioned hashbrowns seem to be missing), this is a reliable, quick option if you're in a hurry, almost impossibly so. I had my iced coffee in my hand seconds after I'd ordered it. I doubt I'd get that kind of service at any other location.  This McCafe is well worth a visit if you're in the station."}
{"text":"Wow, the crew working at this location are running like a well tuned machine cranking out those orders continously to serve GO train commuters. It seems like this location gets a rush of customers each time a GO trains pulls into Union Station during the morning rush hour. Service has to be super fast in order to keep up with the line up of customers. It took less than 5 minutes to get my coffee and BLT bagel after ordering from the self serve kiosk. Everything was up to McDonald's usual high standards for food and service.  Remember that this is a McCafe location not a full service McDonalds location so you won't be able to order everything like you normally can."}
{"text":"Long wait for an order that is always wrong.  Newer staff are rude - no smiles, no hello, no sorry when they screw up."}
{"text":"I come to this McCafe quite often and was a little disappointed that I couldn't use my breakfast coupons.  Just a heads up, they do not make hashbrowns here so some of your coupons automatically become invalid at this location.  I'd like to say that the staff are very nice, contrary to the other franchises =p  Unfortunately I did have a very negative experience here.  The pastries are honestly super tasty, however, there are SO many flies that circle around the glass area.  In fact, when I got my item there was a fly stuck inside the bag.  I was pretty shocked when I discovered the little bug and reported this tragedy to the cashier rep.  She quickly apologized and swapped out the pastry for me.  Good service, but just an unfortunate event.    I will still come back but seriously, should management do something about the flies? Lol."}
{"text":"Located right in Union station, and you can be sure this place is extremely busy during rush period. However, in spite of its small size, they're staffed with about as many as a conventional McD's, so things keep moving.  As the name indicates, they sell the McCafe side of things, and not burgers and fries. They do however have have a couple of sandwiches and breakfast sandwiches too.  For me, McCafe's food and drink quality is somewhere above Tim's and below Starbucks (for the most part). However, their prices are firmly alongside Tim's. All three are also located within the station. Tim's is naturally ruled out, so for me McCafe is a solid option if I want to spare a couple of bucks over going to Starbucks if I'm in a frugal mood - or spare a couple minutes if I'm in a rush since they're faster too.  There's a small seating area with phone chargers which is nice if your phone's about to die before getting on your ride home.  The quality of the food and drink is about a 3, but price and convenience bring it up to a 4."}
{"text":"With talk of McDonald's revenue going downhill, I think this was a really smart idea to branch out into a different market. McCafe is definitely the swanky, trendy, more sophisticated older brother to the original McDonalds. With items like quinoa and apple brie croissants, it's really great to see some variety to the McDonalds menu while they keep the classic breakfast items intact. I actually first came into contact with a standalone McCafe overseas in Asia and thought it was a great idea so I'm really glad they're testing it out here.   I don't remember if this is the case for McDonalds, but all the teas are the same price, which I think is a very smart move. For food, I've only tried some of their pastries and bagels, but they're quite good. They won't blow you away, but it's about the same quality as a Tim's and cheaper too.   They also have self-serving kiosks that accept only debit/credit. They're really great at saving time in the morning during rush hour when everyone just wants a coffee. McDonalds has also invested quite a bit in staff training as well. Everyone there has been very professional and friendly. There are always one or two employees out front directing people into the line or the kiosk and teaching people how to use the machines. This really helped to keep things moving."}
{"text":"For those who frequent Union Station, the loss of the McDonalds was palpable.  For months, the hoarding was up in the York Concourse and people waiting for the GO Trains were limited in food options.  I was more curious about the fact that they offer all day breakfast sandwiches.  So how does McCafe measure up?  All day breakfast sandwiches. Check.  Coffee. Check.  Hashbrowns? Nope.  Two out of three ain't bad but it won't replace a breakfast from McDonalds.  It isn't striving for that, though.  Here, you'll find prepared sandwiches, muffins and other baked goods and the same coffee options that you would find at their other locations.  There are no burgers or fries to be found here.  Ordering is pretty straight forward but sometimes the screen wouldn't register my finger taps.  The kiosk next to me didn't print out a receipt so the guy next to me was delayed as well.  While this was going on, the two employees at the cash register were free so maybe this self-serve kiosk thing might not save you any time.  Upon ordering on the kiosk, you have options to choose 1/2 decaf, add a shot of vanilla syrup, add sugar, milk, cream or Splenda.  You can even request for the condiments on the side.  I didn't try any of their pastries or sandwiches today but they do have a pre-prepared selection for pick-up.  Maybe Hashbrowns are too déclassé for a McDonalds coffee shop but I can't have an Egg McMuffin without it."}
{"text":"I like the fact that you can customize anything that you purchase here. But don't understand why they have a different menu at different places.  It has happened with me 3 times now. They have a different menu at Pickering and a different one at union station.  Overall I am happy with the taste of the food. Especially because I am a vegetarian and I get to customize the menu as per my needs and choices.   The veggies wrap is delicious and my favourite coffee and muffin. My kids always go for the junior chicken which they just love and my husband tries different things every time. And he gives a thumbs up to every single thing he has ordered till date."}
{"text":"ALL. DAY. BREAKFAST.   Enough said?   But seriously, who doesn't love the availability of an all day McDonald's breakfast. It's become a bit of a staple on weekends around my house as it's so close and I'm addicted to their delicious coffee.   This McCafe has the new order machines, which gives options for busier days. On weekends, it's generally quiet. I have yet to stop by on a weekday morning (could be crazy!). They only serve breakfast sandwiches, pastries, and some smaller pre-packed snacks, no Big Macs here.  Never had an issue with a wrong order and they display your order number when it's ready. Doesn't get any easier than that!  I would have given 5 full stars but they don't serve hashbrowns at this location. And hashbrowns are truly what MAKE a McDonald's breakfast great!   You'll still see me here most weekend mornings grabbing at least my morning cup of joe. My god, that coffee is so good!  -Ashley Marie"}
{"text":"Very conveniently located for a nice cup of coffee while waiting for the GO train. I had the Apple Brie Honey Croissant and it was delish! Next time I come here I want to try the affogato. WIFI signal was so-so but they have charging cables for your iPhone/android in case you are running low."}
{"text":"What is this fascinating mcd's spin off?  Fresh food? breakfast all day? healthier options then a normal mcd's? I'm in! both feet, deep end in!  A huge upgrade from the McDonald's in the old union station waiting area, the one thing that I noticed right off that bat was that everything smelled good, because my biggest complaint about getting food from anywhere in the old union station was you could smell all of the burgers they were cooking, alternatively hashbrowns in the morning.  not a lot of seating within the actual restaurant, but lots of seating in the concourse area. the staff are SUPER awesome, super friendly, and the service is fantastic. all the times I've walked by this place there's a bit of a line up, but the line up moves very very quickly.  if this is mcd's attempt at putting a dent into Tim Horton's(primary) or Starbucks(secondary), then these companies should be on notice. They need more locations in the Toronto area, and this location sets the standard for not only McCafe's but McDonald's in general. very happy and left me wanting to come back!"}
