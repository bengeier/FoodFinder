{"text":"This is probably my favorite healthy food place after the gym. Fresh food as well so it is the best place if you are looking for healthy food after the gym. Highly recommend for you guys to try it. I had Island Style Teri Chicken and it was so good with mixed veggies and spinach."}
{"text":"I work at the salon next door, and I come here everyday for lunch. The food is phenomenal- fast, fresh and delicious. The teriyaki tri tip is probably my favorite, it is so good! I'd like to also comment on how affordable it is. Compared to other healthy cafes, it is a fraction of the cost. If you're looking for some good clean eats- definitely give this place a try, you won't regret it."}
