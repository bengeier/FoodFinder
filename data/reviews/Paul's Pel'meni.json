{"text":"Underwhelming at best, but not bad per say.

Paul's was open a number of years ago, closed down because it was mediocre, and has since reopened (about 2013ish).

They basically boil some frozen, store bought dumplings and cover them in curry powder, a little sauce, and sour cream. The potato dumplings are pretty flavorless and the result leaves you wanting more out of the dish. 

If you're in the mood for dumplings go to The Dumpling Haus instead and get some dumplings and bao. You'll be much happier for it."}
{"text":"We received a restaurant.com gift certificate for this place. Without that, we probably would never have tried it. Boy am I glad we did. The menu is so simple, but so delicious and incredibly interesting.  Choose beef or potato or mix and half or full order with or without the works. The flavor combo with the works is great. Something you won't find anywhere else in town. We were told that they source many of their ingredients locally and organically. And the price is so reasonable ($6.50 for full and $4.50 for half). We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yes! I am so glad Pelmeni is back! My first experience was at the old State Street location while taking Russian language at UW, which really starter my love for dumplings!

Went for the full mixed (potato and beef) order for lunch, with the works (curry powder, sweet chili sauce, cilantro, sour cream). Such a comforting, deliciously warm dish. I love the way the flavors work together-- hot chili and cooling sour cream, warm curry and fresh cilantro!

I work a few blocks away and I imagine I'll be back frequently in the winter. It's the perfect dish to fill you up and keep you warm!"}
{"text":"Delicious homemade potato and meat dumplings. Russian rye on the side. Served with a sprinkling of curry and cilantro. Sour cream and sriracha sauce on the side. That's it for the menu, but that's all that's needed. 
We stopped after seeing the Yelp reviews. Good choice! I'll dream about these dumplings as we continue our cross country drive"}
{"text":"This is the only place I know of in the area that has anything close to slavic-style food, so I like to go when I get homesick. While great there, my favorite is to actually take home a container to fry up with some butter until golden brown and serve with their side of sour cream. 

Menu is simple: beef, potato, or mix of the 2, half or full (their half I would say is closer to \"3/4\"), pick your toppings from butter, sour cream, or \"the works.\" Perfect for a comforting lunch dinner, or late night bite, usually very quick service. Not a whole lot of seating but I haven't had to fight anyone for a spot yet."}
{"text":"These dumplings are amazing. Get them with the works!  If you can't make it downtown, you can also get them at Oasis Cafe in Fitchburg.  Say hi to Paul."}
{"text":"The best tasting dumplings I've ever had, I always bring friends from out of town here. The only draw back is the staff isn't large so you might have to wait a bit if you go at the busy times. It is worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"We tried this place yesterday because I saw that they had such good reviews. The food was excellent. It is a simple and small menu but the food is delicious. So much so that my husband wanted to go back again later that evening! The staff were also very friendly and helpful. It is definitely a place we will be returning to again and again."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying this: if this review were strictly for the food, a 5 star review would be a no-brainer. The dumplings (which FYI are the only option that they have) are fantastic in every way. And for those of you who don't like chili sauce and/or curry...they are delicious without them as well. We ordered a half order of potato and a half of beef. Half an order is enough for one person (although after you taste them your stomach may be able to convince you that it can fit another 2 plates worth).

The service had a few issues however. The cashier could not get the register to work and our order was somehow lost in the shuffle. If I wasn't paying attention to who ordered behind me, we may have been sitting there waiting all day. With that being said, once I informed them that our order was lost, they were very apologetic and made it up to us with a full order of the potato pelmenis. Also, no one around us had any issues similar to ours, so it was probably an exception and not the rule."}
{"text":"Simple dish well done. We ordered the combination  (half meat / half potato ) with the works (sriracha, rice wine vinegar , curry and cilantro ).

Make sure you get the rye bread and sour cream.

Yum yum."}
{"text":"So good! Fresh, flavorful, and filling but not too heavy. I recommend the mix beef and potato with the works. A must try spot in Madison!
Note: if you don't like dumplings don't come here because that's all they serve"}
{"text":"Our family has eaten here a couple times a month for about 18 months and it used to be a favorite weekend tradition. Simple potato and beef dumplings with sprinkled spices and toppings. Who knew such a simple dish could be so delicious?

After Paul's moved to their new location recently, we found the new location and attempted to continue our tradition. The new location has considerably less allure, with a dive-y kitchen in the back and eating your meal at a table in a bar setting. A TV runs with sports in the corner and the kitchen blasts with whatever the staff of the day wants to listen to. Pretty much all of the ambience of the original location is gone, including the background music which used to be sort of Alt-Rock-y.

Let's move to the staff. I get the impression that the first location was operated by the founders of the restaurant or at least they had a strong hand at the tiller. Now, staff seems to rotate frequently and it shows. Orders take a long time to get into the staff, and getting your food takes even longer.

But, let's focus on the food, which is more important. Lately the food is served lukewarm at best and the dumplings are undercooked. The application of the spices has changed as well - subtle, but important since the spicing is pretty subtle to begin with.

Today was the worst time ever, and is the day we have decided never to return.

- I stood around for a very long time, being ignored even though the staff member was right in front of me. She seemed slightly overwhelmed and was on the phone. She avoided any interaction until she was ready; not even a \"hello, give me a moment, sorry for the wait.\"
- The sink in the kitchen was piled high with dirty dishes, right in view as you place your order. Our meals took a very long time to be delivered to us. It was not busy.
- I asked for some glasses for water and was handed 3 filthy, dripping wet glasses to drink out of. All three glasses still had greasy marks on the rim from the previous patron.
- All 3 of our noodles were cold to lukewarm and undercooked. The toppings were skimpy and unevenly applied.
- One of us ended up feeling quite ill the rest of the afternoon, likely from undercooked meat in the dumpling.

It's a shame to see a previous Madison favorite disappear into disrepair like this. I am guessing the owners moved it to consolidate with the bar next door and save on rent. But they also removed their involvement and are not vetting the quality and dedication of the staff, and potentially not training them sufficiently as well. I predict their revenues will dive along with the rent unless they get involved and pay attention to their dying business.

Owners - go eat at your restaurant sometime and see what has happened. This is precisely how successful businesses go bankrupt - owner lowers involvement, hires staff who don't care or are not trained, and the exceptionally simple and previously delicious food and experience disappear, never to be found again."}
{"text":"There is not much selection, but there does not need to be when the food is that good. I had the full mix with the works, and my companion had just the butter and sour cream. Mine might have been a bit heavy with curry, but so good and so cheap too."}
{"text":"Paul's gets better every time I go. The dumplings are unique and so, so good. Make sure to get all the toppings-- much better that way. It's remarkable they can do so well while offering just one dish, but it's a testament to how good those dumplings are."}
{"text":"Paul's Pel'meni specializes in one thing and one thing only: Pel'meni. Pel'meni is a sort of Tortellini mixed with dumplings, then covered in yellow curry, cilantro, and sour cream. At Paul's, they serve beef and potato pel'meni. I tried a half size of both flavors, and for someone with a small stomach like me, it was plenty of food for dinner (it doesn't look like it would be enough, but it's really hearty).

While both flavors were good, I preferred the beef. It was spicy (as in with spices) and extra flavorful, compared to the potato and I think next time I'll probably get just the beef and set of a mixture of both of them.

Also, the price point was awesome. All this goodness for 4.50 for a half. I can't wait to come back after a night on state street. It will be good post night out food."}
{"text":"Paul's does precisely one thing, and they do it very well. Steps to enjoy:

1. Enter the shop. Take in the aromas and salivate accordingly.
2. Order a full, mostly beef but with some potato thrown in for variety.
3. Get 'the works'. Just do it. Bread is sometimes nice but you can usually go without.
4. Wait a paltry amount of time before being presented with some fantastic pelmeni.
5. Eat the dang dumplings.

Great at midday, the very early morning, and anytime in between."}
{"text":"So goooooooood and so simple! I love their pelmenis, and Paul himself is a gem.

I thought they used grass fed beef though and am not certain if that is still around. Bring it back pwetty pwease!"}
{"text":"To be brief, the menu selection is fairy limited, but will make your decision much easier. The atmosphere is casual, and the food was delicious. I would recommend the mix (1/2 beef, 1/2 potato) unless you have dietary concerns, with the works."}
{"text":"Excellent place to grab a quick bite to eat.  The people were welcoming and helpful if you don't know what to do and they were happy to answer any questions you had.

I had the full plate with the mix of beef and potato.  The curry, sauce and cilantro on the dumplings were excellent and added to my enjoyment of the dish."}
{"text":"This is a taste treat and is a hidden gem in Madison! Get a full order and take some home. I know that kids even love it. Easy on some of that hot sauce as it will make you sweat!"}
{"text":"If you're in the area and want a low-key, low-cost, delicious offering, stop in. The pel'menis (a cross between perogis and dumplings).

If you like meat, don't waste your time getting the potato/combo. The meat is great. 

If you also don't want to have to choose anything, there's only meat and potato. They make it easy for you. Treat yourself and order some."}
{"text":"Tucked away at a little corner off Gorham St is this easy to miss treasure, but don't miss it! The entrance might be somewhat hard to find, you will be able to see nicely-cushioned red seats and a nice counter area where they serve up those delicious little dumplings!

What are Russian dumplings?? Prior to my first trip here I had always associated dumplings with something Asian. So this is really an eye-opening experience for me. I love how they offer beef or potato fillings for their dumplings. The thing that makes them so special is that 1) they are small cute little dumplings and 2) the works. As other reviews have pointed out you can get cilantro, curry powder, siracha-rice vinegar sauce, sour cream and butter to go with those dumplings. You can ask for as little or as many of the works on offer. 

I have always liked my order with all the works, simply because they have put in a lot to make sure that everything pair up perfectly with one another. The siracha might be spicy, but the sour cream neutralizes the spice a lot. In other words, just amazing ~~ If you order the half beef half potato combo, it's always a nice surprise to find out what the filling is going to be for your next dumpling!

For small eaters the half order will fill you up perfectly. They also offer the raw dumplings to go. They will pack them nicely for you fresh out of the fridge. The nice thing if you decided to go for the raw dumplings is that there are significantly more of them per box, always worth it to make your own since all you have to do it heat them in boiling water for a couple of minutes. Then you can let your imaginations take you in terms of toppings. 

Do remember this is a cash-only place though. Totally worth everything ~~~"}
{"text":"Dumplings are great. Don't think you know what you're getting into because you've had a perogi before... not even a competition."}
{"text":"We thought we would try this, our 14 year old was set on this, after reading the ratings. We ordered 3 orders for 4 of us, all with the works, as many have recommended that... We, however would not recommend the works unless you like a lot of heat. 

These come with sour cream and we all only ate until the sour cream was gone, after that they were too spicey to eat on their own. 

They are well made, and the price is not bad for the amount of dumplings. I wish we would have ordered them plain, I think we would have enjoyed these, if we had. Now, we have 2 boxes left out of the 3 we ordered...

So, moral of the review, if you don't like lots of heat, don't order the works!"}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times. The flavors are delicious and the service is usually friendly and courteous. The problem? 

I ate here most recently (a ground beef with the works) and I got horrible food poisoning. Like, \"If I don't get to a bathroom in the next 45 seconds, I'm going to need to invest in new pants\" - terrible food poisoning. 

I guess if you like playing Russian Roulette  (pardon the pun) with your food then you should eat here. It's unfortunate because the food is actually very tasty."}
{"text":"For $7 or so, I was blown away by the taste and quantity of the Pelmeni. As many have noted, \"the works\" add so much flavor and uniqueness to the already delicious Pelmeni. 

The service is fast and friendly as well. Madison is lucky to have a specialty shop like this that does Russian dumplings justice."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a small late lunch. I don't usually take the time to write Yelp reviews, but this was some of the best food I've had in a long time. You know a place does something good if its the only thing they are serving.

Staff was super friendly too, good work on a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite dumplings place in town. If you're going to splurge, then do it here!"}
{"text":"Amazing dumplings. Super filling and very, very tasty. The staff is pleasant and wonderful, too. This place is definitely a gem."}
{"text":"They do one thing very very well. The speed of service is variable, but you can usually get served in a matter of minutes, possibly a matter of seconds. The size of the shop is sometimes a bit too small when people bum around chatting and nursing their water or soda after eating, but generally you can be in and out in 20 minutes. Great location just off state street, and a great choice for a quick lunch or a late night bite."}
{"text":"I love this place!

It is simple, yet oh so delicious! The spice mixture on the little russian dumplings is great, especially with the cilantro and siracha sauce. 

$6.50 for a full order is very reasonable and filled me up. (I even split it with a friend). 

I am definitely coming back here many times."}
{"text":"Honest food, that is made fresh daily. They do two kinds of dumplings, a beef and a potato variety, and they do them quite well. If you don't want the chain restaurant, pre made food, repetitive garbage all up and down State Street, stop in here, they will serve you until after bar time on the weekends, and for this we should thank them. Thats about 300 less drunk meatheads that the city doesn't have to deal with that night because nobody has time to fight or act like an asshole when they're busy stuffing their pieholes with dumplings . A great place to have in our community."}
{"text":"Ended up here on a date night and took our pel'meni to the steps of the Capitol for a picnic. Amazingly delicious for very little money and quick preparation. If you get the works, \"splurge\" on the slice of bread to mop up the leftover sauce."}
{"text":"I could honestly eat their pelmeni any time for the rest of my life. The flavors are really amazing. Just the right amount of heat with the sriracha and side of sour cream."}
{"text":"Portion size was good and the curry flavor was good. The dough was thicker than I prefer but I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Its so simple and delicious, I'm suprised they haven't taken over the world. 

Step 1 - Choose beef or potato dumplings (or both!)
Step 2 - Get them with the Works (you don't have to, but trust me, you should)
Step 3 - Give them very little money and have your mind blown

So. Good."}
{"text":"I didn't want to give 2 stars (\"meh I've experienced better\") because I've never had this type of dumpling before. There was nothing bad about them, but they're not something I'm in a hurry to eat again. A little bland and felt like a brick in my stomach.

The person who took my order was super nice and very helpful. Answered all of my questions without making me feel like I was being a pain."}
{"text":"Visiting from San Francisco and found this gem. Loved the dumplings. Mix is the way to go with the works, if you like spice. Sour cream cuts spice just right. You have try to it!"}
{"text":"How do I love Paul's Pel'meni? Let me count the ways:
They are DELICIOUS
They are inexpensive
They are made from locally sourced beef
They are made fresh for each order
They are nearby the capitol
They are ready really quickly
Yet I think they are healthier than fast food
They have perfect seasonings (which I totally would not have expected to work on dumplings - but it is oh so good)
I already mentioned the deliciousness.

Eat some dumplings already!  There is no excuse not to!"}
{"text":"I just placed an order of 15 different orders for my co-workers that have never been to Pel'meni before and I think I just created a new obsession for them!  Not only did they take my phone order early they got everything right!  Each order had a different request and they nailed it.  When I went in to pick up the order I was happily greeting by two workers that thank me for my business and hoped that everyone enjoyed their lunch!  Customer service was amazing, the food was wonderful, and the overall experience was amazing!  I'm a lifer!"}
{"text":"Good food, service was very responsive.  I am here on business and stopped in a few different places.  This location was far superior to the others.

The one thing that I really liked was how the server had a good knowledge not just of the menu but of other options we might want to try."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! I only wish it weren't so goddamn spicy. My bowels are in pain right now."}
{"text":"I think its dumpling is alright~ although different than I expected, still thumb up for it. But the dumpling wrap is too thick, the filling is ok"}
{"text":"My friend and I were having the eternal debate about where to go to eat when we came across a review on yelp that started \"I really didn't want to like this place\" yet had 5 stars, so immediately I was intrigued.
I purchased a large order of \"The Mix\" with \"The Works\" which was basically a mixture of both their potato dumplings and their ground beef dumplings topped with butter, chili powder, cilantro, and some other stuff I can't remember. 
All of this for $7 dollars (already including tax)
I highly recommend getting \"The Works\" because the dumplings on their own are kind of bland. It makes for easy food to eat while walking down State Street!
Aside from this there isn't much to be said, it tastes great and has a great price for the amount of dumplings you get.

Only reason I give it a 4 and not a 5 is because it lacks options. There are only two items on the menu and not much variety. Still a great place to grab some food!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. 

Why? It's cheap, delicious, filling, fast, and open late.
This is my \"locals only\" place I always take people to when they visit, it's that good. 

If you've never had russian dumplings, you're in for a savory, buttery treat. Try it with the works and have your mind blown. This is a place that is a perfect example of why you only need to serve one item, don't mess with perfection!"}
{"text":"Ordered a full order of mixed with the works. Very tasty, fast and friendly. First time here totally hit the spot when nothing else sounded good. Super inexpensive also, would do again any time"}
{"text":"Pel'meni's?!  Tasty tiny dumplings with a sriracha & sweet chili hot sauce to add if wanted.  A little tub of sour cream to cool things down.  So fun to have the bar with local and unique west coast brews."}
{"text":"This opening was a little bittersweet for me.  Sad that the dumplings are no longer down the street from my house in Fitchburg, but happy that they have returned to their rightful place on State Street. 

The dumplings are just as tasty as ever.  Go for the full order of mixed meat and potato with the spicy sauce and an extra side of sour cream.  And then come back for dinner for another order.

The new place has a different more modern feel than the old hole in the wall.  Can't say whether this is good or bad - all I know is that I would sit in a cardboard box on the corner and eat them if I had to."}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick snack. Ordered half of each. Excellent. Just the right level of spice. Don't forget to eat them along with the sour cream."}
{"text":"I can't really add anything new to what others have written. My son chose this place because he loves Russian food. He was very satisfied and so was my pocketbook. Super friendly staff on the night we visited. Parking is hard as it is everywhere in downtown Madison."}
{"text":"As an unofficial expert on dumplings, I had to try these Russian dumplings at Paul's. I ordered a half order of the mixed beef & potato with the WORKS, and it was da bomb! 

The dumplings were mini sized and had a nice chewy dough. The beef was nicely seasoned and the potatoes were reminiscent of mashpo. It was like eating mini pierogies. The best part of Paul's is their Asian fusion spin with the toppings. The butter, chili sauce (sriracha + rice wine vinegar), sour cream and cilantro really added a lot of flavor to the baby dumplings. 

The nice gentleman behind the counter said they make all their dough & fillings in house and even showed me the cool machine they use. 

Paul's pelminis are a delicious snack (sober or drunk)!"}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised by the combination of flavors in this dish and how well they work together"}
{"text":"Simple, direct, exactly what a dumpling shop should be.  Great flavor, just enough kick."}
{"text":"I. Love. This. Place!

Friendly staff, minimal menu, delicious food! There is a vegetarian option and if you don't like spicy food, you don't need to get the curry or sweet chili sauce. 
Cooked in view of the customer so you always know what you're getting. And the wait is always less than 10 minutes. If I could survive on this food alone, I'd be here every day."}
{"text":"Now this is comfort food. A big bowl of meat and potato filled dumplings smothered in melted butter, sour cream, curry, hot sauce, and fresh cilantro. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Super delicious! Family of five eat their fill for about $25, which is around what we'd spend at fast food but so much tastier. Great, friendly service from the singing dumpling cook and the register guy. Kids loved 'em plain, we took ours mixed with the works. Glad I don't live in Madison or I'd be in trouble!!!"}
{"text":"Met and far exceeds expectations. I love simple menus and it doesn't get much simpler than Paul's. I ordered a regular size, mix (potato and meat) with the works (a house chili/curry concoction). The spice was perfect. The dumplings were tender and the dough wasn't overwhelming. I loved the surprise of having a potato or meat dumpling. I am a happy girl. I might have to go back tomorrow for another helping."}
{"text":"These dumplings are amazing weather you just wanna grab lunch, a late night snack, or drunk food. The staff is super chill and really nice. I have never been disappointed going there, I normally get the half size with the works and when I look at it I think I will need more food but by the time I leave I'm always full. 100% would recommend."}
{"text":"It's ok.  My sister is obsessed with their food and got us to try it.  Not bad just nothing I really loved or would make a point to come back for."}
{"text":"Just all the love for this little dumpling shop that makes wintertime bearable. Whenever I come back to Madison, I buy extra orders of pel'meni (beef and potato mix with the works, sans sour cream) to take home. it's just that good. I've even attempted making my own pel'meni at home, but it's not the same. 

The rye bread isn't worth it, but I'd love if they offered salads or desserts or something on the side."}
{"text":"I wasn't around for the first Paul's but I am over joyed that I get to experience this one.

Walling down state street it might be hard to see but when you find such a treasure like this you never want to let it go. I always buy the full mixed with the works and I almost have to buy another one cause of how good it is.

If you're  walking around downtown stop buy Paul's you'll never be unsatisfied."}
{"text":"When I heard about this place I was very skeptical. Russian food? Dumplings? Pel what'i? It is now one of my favorite lunch spots in town. Answer three questions and you're good: Beef, potato or mix? Half or full? With the works (butter, curry, sriracha and cilantro)? Plus they have the nicest, most generous service as well. Can't recommend enough."}
{"text":"Straightforward menu, pretty much just pelmeni. I got both beef and potato, personally like potatoes better. The Works topping really made it flavorful without being salty! A somewhat light and healthy comfort food that is delicious!"}
{"text":"Simple and absolutely delicious. It's the go-to quick dinner for myself and my husband on busy work days. While your options are beef dumplings, potato dumplings, or a mix of the two, the to-the-point menu makes ordering easy - I highly recommend all of the fixings as well. To top it off, the staff is always really pleasant and friendly, not matter what time you visit!"}
{"text":"Glad I tried this place, one menu item and very affordable.  Had Pel'mini in Russia so I was very curious. Staff was very friendly. The food was great! The works does add a little spice (not to much) but tons of flavor. Mix in the sour cream and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good Pel'meni! Only.. WHERE'S THE DILL? And extra money for sourcream?? Give me a break!"}
{"text":"Small clean quaint little place. Got a full mix with the works and all I can say is yumumumumummmmmy. So worth it. Full of delicious Russian dumplings for $6.50. I can't tell you if they're legit, never had them before, but I can say if this is the \"crappy American version\" I'm heading to Russia cause that real stuff must be like crack."}
{"text":"Great, inexpensive, and quick. 
Get the works. Worse case scenario, dig to the bottom and there are plain ones underneath. Taste one as soon as you get it, if you like it then stir it up so that the seasonings get all mixed up in there and you aren't left with bland bottoms. Kids loved all the spice - and even if you don't, the sour cream will help you out with any heat. 
We had 2 adults and 2 kids and got 2 full orders. We were pleasantly full but not stuffed. I didn't want to end up with leftovers - no microwave in the hotel room - and I wasn't sure how well they'd reheat anyway, they might stick together very badly and/or fall apart easily.
Loved them so much I went back in and got some frozen to take home for later.  
Definitely a must eat."}
{"text":"Are you an exhausted college student? Have you been awake since 6am? Do you not have enough time to do laundry AND cook dinner? Well do I have the restaurant for you!

Paul's Pel'meni is dumpling restaurant. For a reasonable price you get a lot of dumplings. That's all you need to know. 

Perfect for take out or if you forgot to eat and you're meeting friends at a bar. It doesn't exactly have the kind of atmosphere you'd want to hang out in. But that's not the kind of place Paul's is. It's a place to get your dumplings and get out."}
{"text":"Cheap and the food is consistently satisfying. you can order mix with beef and potato without toppings"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The staff is great and the food is delicious. I am a repeat customer and they never get old!"}
{"text":"Granted, I'm used to San Francisco prices, but $6.50 (tax included) for a full order seems like a steal! First time in Madison and gave the place a try after seeing all the positive reviews...boy am I glad I did! Freshly made, local ingredients, and friendly service. Awesome spot."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 10 years, always amazing. Never tired of this stuff :)"}
{"text":"Yea I'm not feeling the 4 1/2 star hype here. We ordered the large mix (beef and potato $6.50)with the works - curry powder, siracha, cilantro and a side of sour cream - and a small ($4.50)beef. 

The beef is very dry in the dumplings and to get the most flavor out of the dumplings they need to be slathered in their special siracha rice wine vinegar sauce. 

I've had better dumplings at Asian Sweet Bakery. I get that these are different kind of dumplings but dumplings nonetheless. 

Pro tip: I was able to find a $5 for $10 coupon on restaurant.com if this is your favorite haunt."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. For the uninitiated, pelmeni are a sort of Russian cross between a pierogi and a tortellini. They come in potato and beef variety, topped with spices, sriacha, and sour cream. The place is tiny and casual, but clean and well lit. Perfect for a late night bite. My only wish is that they had one salad for those of us hoping to get a little veg with our dumplings. Maybe a cucumber one, or a slaw? The word on the street is their moving to a bigger location with a bar, so maybe I'll get my wish after the move."}
{"text":"First time having Russian food and there's only one thing on the menu so I was skeptical at first. But after trying, I would definitely come back. It's a bunch of different tastes on your palate. Butter, yellow curry, sweet chili sauce, cilantro, and sour cream. Spicy salty and sweet all the same time. Good portions too!"}
{"text":"I stopped into the location they used to hold over on State St. during my sophomore year of college and while the condition of their shop was a bit questionable at the time, I remember the food being delicious. My college kid self should've been a bit more concerned with the large chunks of insolation falling out of the roof but I was young, naive and ready to accept the notion that maybe they were just going for a hip \"industrial\" look.

The new location just off of State on Gorham is simple, clean and bright. I went during lunch and the line definitely picked up after we arrived. Trendsetters much? I dove in for the large portion of mixed dumplings (half potato and half beef) with \"The Works\" to top 'em. Curry, cilantro, butter, sour cream, hot sauce and what not were perfect compliments and I left with that perfect full but not too full feeling. Definitely pass up AJ Bombers next door and opt for Pel'meni instead. They impressed me and they didn't even have to shoot off a ceiling rocket of peanuts to do so."}
{"text":"Probably Madison's most unique food contribution. When people from out of town want to experience something uniquely Madison, Paul's is the first (and one of the few places left) to pop in my mind. 

Their dumplings are outrageously good. Topping them with butter, sour cream, Sriracha, cilantro and curry powder only take them through the roof. 

Their new space is a welcome change. It's airy, efficient and has a great beer selection. What else do you need? 

They still only do dumplings and have yet to stray from that. Gotta love a place that does one thing and does it perfectly."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Madison. Open late and serving the best dumplings you'll ever have. You never have to wait very long and the people who work there are customer service gods."}
{"text":"You need order half or full at first.
After that you need to choose ground beef or potato or mixed. The ground beef means beef dumplings is superb! Then you may choose some works for extra taste."}
{"text":"Four words: consistently delicious comfort food.

I have been to this restaurant so many times and rarely am ever disappointed. Grab a full order of the mixed with the works, a good friend, and indulge in the beauty that are these piping hot little Russian dumplings.

It's great because it's also open late nights and isn't super expensive either, so going to Paul's is pretty much and all pros, no cons situation. Sometimes the line can get long, but it moves quickly.

If you live in Madison or are even visiting, stop by and enjoy this little gem that is slightly tucked away from the bustle of State Street."}
{"text":"Paul's Pel'meni is a hidden gem! I love menus where you don't have to make a lot of decisions, and that's definitely the case here. Full order of half beef, half potato with the works (yellow curry, sweet chili sauce, cilantro, and sour cream). So filling and flavorful and a great price! It's a very small restaurant, nothing too special on the inside, but definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"It's very simple to order. You want a full or half order? Then do you want ground beef, pitot so or a mix? I preferred the ground beef but liked the mix. Get ALL the toppings and enjoy! 

I like the simplicity. They need more seating. And the wait time was 15 mins when I came at lunch with a group. But order ahead or away from the lunch hour. I wanna go back, it was yummy! 

Great staff, one was chatty and awesome to talk to about the food. He clearly loves his job!"}
{"text":"The pel'meni is definitely worth trying but it narrowly missed the mark of becoming a regular place I order from. I do believe the beef could be seasoned just a bit better; I did not like the taste of seemingly, unseasoned beef. The potato pel'meni is very dank though. Its well seasoned, usually piping hot, and tastes fresh. 

I also love and hate the oversimplified menu. You can count on one hand how many choices you have but you are not racking your brain as to what to order."}
{"text":"Freak yeah! Paul's is where it's at! They've got all the bases covered. You want a quick, delicious and filling, meal thats also cheap? Pauls is your place. Got the late night munchies? On Friday and Saturday, Pauls serves until 2 A.M. 

Lets talk about flavor. Get the works, I'm telling you, it will not disappoint. This selection leaves you with juicy beef dumplings mixed with potato dumplings to match. It doesn't stop there, imagine this ooey goodness topped with yellow curry powder, sweet chili sauce, butter and sour cream. Pinch me I'm dreaming. 

Oh, not to mention the new location on West Gillman St. has a full service bar open until 11 A.M. on weekdays and 1 A.M. on weekends. haha what? (mic drop)"}
{"text":"I'll never say no to Paul's delish Russian dumplings. This joint is straightforward, and ordering doesn't require much thought. I usually go for the mix - meat dumplings and potato dumplings. You can get them alone if you prefer, but I encourage you get the works: butter, yellow curry, sweet chili sauce, cilantro, and sour cream. Toppings offered separately, too. 

The place was poppin' at 2:30am this weekend, but they handled the crowd seamlessly. There's not a lot of seating, but most peeps take it to go. Paul's consistently offers a great dish in fast fashion. Check this place out, day or night, sober or after the bars."}
{"text":"Get a mixed order with the works and extra sour cream. It's like a fun treasure hunt to guess which bites will be potato and which will be beef. One of our favorite Sunday places to run for lunch in the winter when the Packers aren't playing."}
{"text":"I definitely don't agree with all the rave reviews. I went all out, got the half/half, ordered a small, but got a large, got the whole works ordered with the spices and sauce, but it wasn't anything spectacular. If I were to just go off the dumplings themselves. They aren't  seasoned enough to make me want to eat them alone. If the works is supposed to help with that, then only seasoning the top layer while leaving the bottom all dry needs a little bit more tender loving. I didn't expect I had to eat these like Asian dumplings with soy sauce and vinegar. It must be a drunk food."}
{"text":"Still don't know how to pronounce it, but dang is this place good. We visited two days in a row after we tried it! It's tucked away on a side street of state and has this really cool \"hidden gem\" feel. The menu is incredibly simple. You can either get a half or a full order and either potato or meat dumplings . They are pretty small, about the size of a large grape. Both flavors are great and everything comes with a small container of sour cream. The flavor it with spices that were a little bit too much for me. We tried it just plain and added balsamic vinegar and oil that they have on the tables. That tasted good as well! They have a bar that stays open until one, but the dumplings are served late into the night. I'm so glad we finally tried this place and we will be return customers!"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that the flavors you'll find at Paul's Pel'meni aren't for everyone. 

Think cilantro tastes like soap? Not your place.

Fear the aroma of curry sweat coming back to haunt you six hours after eating it? I'm so sorry for you. 

Wish there was an option at Asian restaurants to order 0.5 stars of spiciness? I'm sad to hear about your condition. 

However, if you can handle the above ingredients, in all their simple glory, you will be richly rewarded. 

It really should be noted that ordering the only thing they have on the menu, and what an amazing thing that item is, in a manner inconsistent with \"the works,\" (cilantro, curry, hot sauce, butter and sour cream), that you are setting yourself up for disappointment. Maybe if you truly hate cilantro, the dish could pass without it; but that's it. If those three things put the ever-loving fear of God into you, just don't go. 

What most people view as Manna from heaven, you will see only as boiled, sloppy balls of meat and potato. They're good, but they're not going to bring you back with the type of ravenous addiction that \"an order with the works,\" brings to me, and 80% of the general populace. 

The place is a feat of modern dining: simple, elegant and proletariat as hell, just so long as you don't mess with the simplicity of the menu. 
God I want some again, it's only been 4 hours since my last fix."}
{"text":"Tasty dumplings (I preferred the potato) and hard to beat the price: $4.50 for a half order, which was just the right amount for me (unlike typical, over large restaurant portions).  The staff were chatty and clearly love what they do.  

My only critique was the wait time - 15 minutes - but it clearly depended on how busy they are and how close a batch of dumplings was to being finished.  A friend came in after us and waited 5 minutes or less."}
{"text":"So delicious and simple. I usually get a full mix order with the works, but I prefer the black earth beef pel'meni so sometimes I'll just get those with the works. I always add some extra sriracha for an extra kick of spice and an extra sour cream b/c the cool creamy flavor balances out the warm and spicy pel'meni. I love this place so much for its great value and delicious comfort food."}
{"text":"Decent, but not impressive.
My Wisconsin friends are all huge fans of this place, but I have to go with my gut (haha) and say I'm not a big potato dumpling fan.  Tried both the regular and curry powder varieties and felt they were pretty one note.  

The interior space is on the sparse side and you can see a lot of what's going on in the kitchen.  There are tables against the window facing the street; great for those chillier days.

Overall, it was a nice experience to (arguably) a Wisconsin institution but I would not go back again."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week. Pel'meni is such a unique find in Madison and Paul's prepares it amazingly! Their menu is simple, which I appreciate. I'm glad they moved to a larger location and really enjoy the addition of a bar. 

Personally I always recommend a full order of the mix with the works. Quite affordable and incredibly delicious. A great stop for lunch, dinner, or for an after bar snack."}
{"text":"Fast, delicious, simple and cheap. Menu is straight forward (size and whether you want beef, potato, or mixed, with spices or not). I always come here when needing a quick meal that is not junk food. The curry, hot sauce and cilantro in the works just work! It is very tasty. No frying (boiling only) also makes it a healthier meal."}
{"text":"Very basic menu. You choose meat, potato or a mix. Cool take on a Russian classic if you get \"the works\" Traditional is vinegar and sour cream."}
{"text":"So tonight my friends and I decided to try Paul's and I'll tell you, this was the best choice ever. This place is great. We wound our way back to the bar and ordered some half-and-half dumplings. These are beef dumplings and potato dumplings mixed, with a perfectly concocted sriracha and rice wine vinegar sauce on top. They serve these with a side of sour cream. You can also get some soy sauce if you please. And a 1/2 order is impressive, maybe 20+ dumplings (about half the size of a potstickers). I found out that I surprisingly like the potato dumplings best. And then there is the bar. I love Alaskan Brewery and they have both the Amber and White on tap. And we also enjoyed the Brandy Old Fashioned's. Oh my, the mixologist (can't remember her name) made these expertly, better than most in the area. I also got to me Paul, the owner/manager/cook. The nicest guy in the world. He didn't know me from Adam and yet set me up with an awesome gift (yes Paul, I'm that guy). So seriously, if you are in Madison and want a quick, inexpensive and quality meal in a laid back super casual place....you MUST check this place out. As one of my buddies said, it's his new favorite place. I 2nd that."}
{"text":"Definitely a cute, hole in the wall. Food was good, but the menu is very limited--it is literally only dumplings. Would still recommend."}
{"text":"I'm relatively new to Madison but when my partner suggested Paul's for lunch, I was excited to try it because I already knew it was a Madtown staple. I was definitely not disappointed! My partner and I shared a full order of half potato/half beef dumplings with all the fixings. The dumplings were perfectly dense and the fillings inside were really flavorful but perhaps the thing that most impressed me was the sriracha vinegar mix that we both doused our dumplings in. Just really solid well-priced comfort food. It's a little light on the veggies so I try not go to too often but I can imagine that if I were undergrad and tired and needing something cheap and sustaining, this would quickly become a staple for me. 

Side note: I've ordered a bunch of their dumplings for delivery for work once too and they were polite, helpful, prompt and brought all the fixings too. They were a hit so if you're looking for a catering option, this might be a cool, very Madisonian option."}
{"text":"Go for it! I never had russian food so I was curious. Small place, clean, casual and very cheap. I got recommended to try the Full Works that consists in a mix of this dumplings with vegetables, potato and beef. Are very different from the asian dumplings, this  were invented to keep you up to fight the cold weather. Some good calories but not heavy. Delicious! Curry, Spicy chillies, sour cream. I had it there in a real plate, thing that i really like. To go back again."}
{"text":"Paul's is a great place for a filling meal that's cheap and moderately healthy. The dumplings are all steamed. I recommend \"the mix\" with the works. The mix is half potato dumplings and half beef. I like the beef more, but if you don't get both, you'll miss the presence of the potato. The works comes with butter, yellow curry, sriracha, cilantro and sour cream. 'The works' toppings really bring the dumplings flavors out. They're on the Hooked App, so on the right day at the right time, you could get a really good deal on some great Russian food. The joint is casual and the people are friendly. This is a go-to for me."}
{"text":"A great place to enjoy warm comfort food on a cold winter's night. My personal favorite is a half order of the mixed pelmeni's, which consists of half potato and half meat, with the works and extra curry sauce.  

Pelmeni's can be either a hit or a miss on your palette. But Paul's pelmeni's is a must try at least? once in your Madison foodventures."}
{"text":"What a gem this place was to find in the middle of the capitol city! It's very unique and I'm so glad I stopped by. The menu is as simple it can get. I got the mix with the works so that I can try it all and it definitely satisfied me. I didn't know I was craving this until I ate it! It was that good! Great, friendly service as well. No complaints here :]"}
{"text":"They do one thing - dumplings - and do them well.  It's also a great deal for lunch.  There isn't much seating so it's best to get your order to go."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food is. UNBELIEVABLY addictive. I just went there on Tuesday, and I want to have some dumplings again!!

Pel'meni is small and kind of hidden away. It actually shares the entrance with the art shop on Gorham, Artist and Craftmans Supply. It's so quiet when we visited at 7pm on Tuesday I thought this was gonna be a terrible experience... There were only a few booths and small tables. Kinda like an abandoned restaurant to be honest.

But hey, we were there, we were hungry, so we ordered the only thing on the menu. ONE order of MIXED meat/potatoes dumplings with THE WORKS (mentioned in other reviews with butter, siracha, cilantro, CURRY POWDER). It took maybe 5 minutes and our meal was out. I was like, hmmph, this is not gonna be enough for my tummy. So there I go, chomping away, and to my surprise, the half order was good enough for me. SO GOODDddDDDDdddddDDDDD. I love how the little things have burst of meat or potatoes in them. And the sauce is really AMAZING. I can't get the flavor out of my head. geez. I would say though, the potatoes are good for filling you up, and meat is THE THING. you have to get some before they're all gone!!! 

I'll definitely come by and grab a to-go of the dumplings, but on the other hand, the dumplings are so tasty I probably wanna have them RIGHT AWAY that I would brave sitting in the kinda lonely and spacious shop. Don't get me wrong, it's very clean and there's alot of space... but it's kinda weird eating in a lonely shop sometimes. In short, GET THE DUMPLINGS. NOW. by hook or by crook."}
{"text":"Great, great comfort food.

It's always so empty whenever I come in, but this place feels super chill and cozy. The warm dumplings are perfect on a cold or rainy day.

The 6.50 price for a full Mixed order with the works is unbeatable. Almost. Being the voracious eater I am, I wish they had a \"mega\" size about 1.5 times a full order for like $8.50 or something. Since getting 2 full orders is too much and 1 full order with a half order is too expensive, I usually only come here when I'm in need of some warm, comfort food or am not feeling too hungry.

But seriously, with the already limited menu, get the FULL MIX with THE WORKS. The slice of bread for just $0.50 goes surprisingly well with the dumplings. And there's no tax so paying is super easy!

My favorite part about the dumplings is not knowing whether the next one's going to be beef or potato until you eat it. I'm dead serious about this keeping your mind almost illogically preoccupied while you eat these delicious dumplings. Just when you think you've gotten the pattern down, you taste a beef completely thinking it was a potato dumpling before. What now.

The flavors work extremely well together. Just take your spoon, scoop up a little bit of the sour cream, pick any one of the n dumplings, dive in, and repeat for remaining n-k dumplings. I like to add some of the sriracha sauce they have (but not too much because it can be a bit overpowering). Somehow I can never finish the dumplings and sour cream at the same time (I always finish the sour cream just before the dumplings) but everything blends harmoniously.

Anyway this is worth your time, your gustatory calyculi, and your wallet. You'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Only one thing on the menu, Dumplings!  Done perfectly. A very inconspicuous location and front door but worth seeking."}
{"text":"Our daughter thinks we come from Maryland just to visit her a couple times a year. We are happy to let her continue to believe that. The reality is we have to get our Paul's Pel'meni fix!   I do have to credit our daughter for finding them and introducing us to them though.     I only wish they delivered to Maryland.   Better yet, a Paul's Pel'meni in Maryland would be great, then maybe our daughter would visit us more!"}
{"text":"So simple, yet so freaking delicious! You can't go wrong with any of your choices. We opted for the half potato-half beef, with The Works. The yellow curry flavor really adds something you didn't realize you'd want, but makes it so much better!"}
{"text":"My new go-to for cheap yummy food. Yes, they don't offer anything but their delicious dumplings. But I don't care! The dumplings are so darn good. 

You can order a half or full order (I found it quite easy to finish the full order, but I can eat a lot haha). You can also order beef, potato or a mix of both. I tried the mix and thoroughly enjoyed both types. If I had to pick a favorite, I'd probably have to say the beef. But only by a margin. 

Whatever they put on top really makes the dish. The combination of flavors is unexpected but very yummy. This place makes me sad (and grateful) that I moved out of downtown, because I would be here every night!"}
{"text":"A million years ago, in a different life, my sister and I had a Friday night dumpling ritual. The location may have changed, but the flavor is just as we remembered. Mmmmmm, nostalgia."}
{"text":"This place really is as good as it gets.  My mouth is watering thinking about how delicious the Pel'meni are here.  Definitely order \"the works\" with any order, but both potato and meat Pel'meni are incredible.  Spicy, salty, rich, and filling, great value- if you live in Madison, you won't find a better place for local, homemade deliciousness."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last night, and it was so delicious. \"Comfort food\" was all I could think as I ate those warm, tasty dumplings after a wet-hair walk in the cold. There are two options, meat and potato. I got the mix with the works. The potato dumplings are creamy and the meat dumplings have little meatballs in them. The curry powder and sauce adds great flavor and goes so well with the sour cream. You've got to try it. 

The location is a bit small though, so be prepared for that. They make the dumplings fresh, so depending on when you go, you may have to wait."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! Make sure to get it fully loaded! Happy employees as well, always an important addition to me. Been twice and both times it's been just as fantastic. Great prices as well!"}
{"text":"This was pretty good.  I didn't entirely know what to expect.  I thought it would be more of a pierogi than gyoza.  It was definitely more like a Thai flavored gyoza.  The flavors  were pretty good overall.  They were all even in size and flavor.  Definitely a good value for money.  Next time I think I'll get it a bit spicier.  

Overall good, but simple."}
{"text":"I love this place. I was so sad when they closed the state st location, but now it's better than ever! I could eat here once a day. I only wished I still lived in Madison so I could!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem. I don't even know why they are so amazing. The first time I ate their dumplings, I thought they were good. But then somehow I found myself craving them...too frequently. I get them with the works, minus cilantro (ew... Holla to my fellow cilantro haters!)

They are just savory and yummy:) Also fun that you can get a mix of potato and meat, so you don't have to choose!

Be careful going right at bar close- you can get stuck with a fairly long wait. Though it's usually worth it, especially at that hour:)"}
{"text":"Cheap! Fast. Savory. Simple. Fun."}
{"text":"Oh my dear God this is the best comfort food ever. Limited menu but I really don't care, they sell dumplings and dumplings is what they do. Get some."}
{"text":"Come here for one thing and one thing only. Mini dumplings, the works, mixed. Be prepared to have new flavor and texture sensations. In between chewy bites of dough and beef with soupy squirts of meat broth, you'll have smooth and filling pockets of potato. 

Paul's Pel'meni are the ingenious late night alternative to pizza or donuts. It's a snack you'll go to sleep dreaming about and wake up wanting more of. Here is a commemorative haiku of my first visit: 

The curry warms, the 
Sriracha bites, cilantro 
brightens, sour cream."}
{"text":"This is a good place to hit up, especially after a night of drinking. Even they moved, they are still in the downtown area.

For around $6.50, you can get a full order - is recommend the mixed with the \"works\" so that you get a little bit of everything.

I definitely prefer the beef over just the potato, as the potatoes by itself might be a little to boring, since the mix def makes it interesting. 

It also seems like they do frozen bulk orders if you are super into their food. A cool mix of dumplings/pierogis. Definitely recommend anyone to pop in, especially late at night!"}
{"text":"I can only imagine that these are as good as they were when I lived in Madison. We used to go ALL the time. So I will give 5 stars for the amazing dumplings I remember from my college and med school days and dock one star for the place being closed this weekend even after calling a couple days ago and verifying that they would be open.   Oh well, maybe next time."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and the dumplings are very good. Both times, I've gotten a full order of the works with beef dumplings. The sauces they put on give it a nice heat though, I think it could use a bit more heat, but that's just a personal opinion. I tried my friend's mashed potato dumpling and was less of a fan. The flavor was fine, but I just didn't like the texture combo, since it's a boiled dumpling with mashed potatoes, it's was too much mushiness for me. But all in all, a nice little spot for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Good food and affordable.  Got the full plate-potato.  All mix ins. Flavorful.  A big portion, enough for tomorrow's meal too! Take out was quick and I had my order in 5 mins."}
{"text":"Just an update to my previous review. The dumplings are still awesome AND due to popular demand, they are back in Fitchburg's EVP Coffee!

For those who dream of enjoying these delicious gems at home, Paul offers frozen portions complete with all the fixings in a take home style. Gotta love the great service!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time earlier this year, and I wasn't sure what to expect.  Was pleasantly surprised and proud of myself for trying something new. It's a great little spot and the food was good as well.  Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Great local place with simple yet excellent menu. Always go for full mixed with the works. Best Russian dumplings in town. Always made fresh which explains the slight wait before you can dig in."}
{"text":"This place is super good. I appreciate the concept: do one thing very well. Freshly made and superb ingredients. Gotta go for the mix with the works!"}
{"text":"Being the only Pel'meni shop I've ever been to I have to give it 5 star. To be fair the food is great. Coming from a guy who live with a Belarusian for way to long. This is a tasty staple of their diet"}
{"text":"This place is everything that each 5-star Yelp review promised. I decided to try Paul's Pel'meni purely based on these reviews and was not disappointment. I opted for a full order, mixed, with the works. I wouldn't have gotten the works if so many reviewers didn't advocate for it, I usually don't like a lot of spice - it is so effing delicious though. The curry, sweet chili sauce, butter and cilantro all work together. The sour cream served on the side evened the spice level for me so I could handle it. I had plenty left over for at least another meal, it's the best deal for lunch/dinner at $7. Definitely my new go-to for quick, delicious, comfort food."}
{"text":"So I told my friends I was coming back to visit them in Madison, but that's not exactly true.

It was really for the dumplings.

As a college SAFEwalker in the early oughts, little hole-in-the-wall Pel Meni served as my dinner often more than once per week.  $5 for a heaping plate of dumplings, sour cream, rye bread, and a soda was a ridiculous deal, and getting to spin records on the regs didn't hurt either.

Fast forward: shady business takeover::boycott::restaurant closes

Nearly a decade later, beloved original owner Paul reigns victorious. Re-opens cafe, and eventually re-opens right off State, now at Henry & Gorham.

Is it a little more expensive now?  Sure.  But it's still $6.50 for over 50 dumplings, and $5 if you buy 'em frozen with all the fixin's, and it's open til 3am - genius.  I was so sad after my pel meni hajj when I finished savoring my final dumpling that I went ahead and bought a bonus frozen order to eat for breakfast the next day.

Half and half.  The works.  If you don't get em spicy you're doin it wrong.

I've had pelmeni in NYC at Russian restaurants and bought them frozen from Russian groceries now here in my fair home of Boston, but they're always a disappointment by comparison.  Listen up Paul - if you ever open up shop/a food truck in Boston, I will dedicate my existence to ensuring your success.

Best meal of 2013, hands down.  Nothing tastes better than nostalgia - especially when the product is even better than you remembered.

I will be back - please please stay in business forever.  I cannot face a world without Paul's pel meni again."}
{"text":"Delicious dumplings!  The menu is very limited (meat dumplings, potato dumplings, or a mix of both, with a couple choices for toppings), but the dumplings are delicious.  

The man working made an error on our order the first time around (apparently he confused the tray of meat dumplings and the tray of potato dumplings, but didn't realize his mistake until they were nearly done cooking, so we had to wait longer than normal for our food).  We didn't make a big deal of it, but not only did he apologize and fix it as fast as possible, he gave each of us an extra serving of dumplings to take home, on the house.  Any restaurant will make a mistake from time to time; it's how you deal with it that counts.  They obviously care a great deal about customer satisfaction here.  They made absolutely sure we left happy in spite of the mistake.  

I will absolutely be going back on a regular basis.  Yum!"}
{"text":"A complete hole in the wall with the best dumplings you can imagine. Yes, the choices are limited. No, you can't make a bad choice.  Fast, tasty, and filling-I don't know how much more you could hope for."}
{"text":"The Wife and I stopped into Paul's Pel'meni one night before going to a show at Overture because we wanted a quick dinner and love dumplings. FYI: Paul's isn't serving Chinese-style dumplings, they're serving Russian dumplings that have a significantly different texture.  According to Wikipedia, \"Pelmeni belong to the family of dumplings, and are related to Ukrainian varenyky and Polish pierogi.\" Anyway, you've now been warned and educated:-)

The menu at Paul's is really simple (see my photo): you can either order a full or a half order, and can choose local grass-fed ground beef, potato, or a mix of the two as the filler in your pelmeni. Then, you choose if you want to get it with \"The Works\": butter, yellow curry, sweet chili sauce, cilantro, & side of sour cream. Beverages are $1.00, and extra sour cream is $0.50.

The guy working the counter was very nice and offer two taster pelmeni covered in \"The Works\" for us to try before ordering.  We really liked it, so we ordered a full order to split between the two of us. Whoops. At first, we were really digging the meal, but about halfway through the order, we both started feeling a little bit queasy, and ended up stopping after eating 3/4 of the meal. Let me be clear - there was nothing wrong with the food that was making us sick; rather, it was simply that the combination of flavors and textures of \"The Works\" on top of the pelmeni was just too much.

I highly recommend that, if you do go, you order the half order and plan to not finish it. Also, unless you have a very strong stomach, I recommend not covering your entire meal in \"The Works\" but rather asking for the specific parts of it that you want on the side to use as a dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Simplest menu, only thing you can get is dumplings, but it was delicious and the service was great"}
{"text":"The highlight of our family outing on State Street was the great taste of the dumplings at Paul's Pel'meni. Our family of four shared a full order (half The Works and half plain w/butter) and it was very satisfying. Even after watching movies that night, everyone was still talking about the dumplings. Really? Yes, kids loved it, husband loved it..me...I thought it was pretty good. Service was good (busy on a sunny Saturday) and there seemed to be quite a few regulars coming and going. Seating wasn't the best for family style sharing, but we made do with two of the round tables on the side. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great simple fare. Low on choices. High on taste. Go there before a night out to be ready to face the bar scene down town."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's the pregnancy or if it's just truly that addicting but all I want to eat after eating here is more Pel'meni. 

Perfect dumplings just the way I remember them, in a slightly cleaner and more comfortable location.  What more can one ask for.  It's affordable, it's filling, it's quick and it's delicious.  I was one happy lady.

I say ordering the combo of potato and beef is a requirement but the potato are really good so don't skip out on those.  Personally, I think there is no better way than with the \"works\", butter, curry, hot sauce, cilantro and sour cream.

I love the simplicity.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"The food was great. When I was in Russia I ate pel'meni just about every day and this restaurant definitely does the food justice. It's not that expensive compared to other places. I really like the flavors that they add to the pel'meni. I would go here very often if I lived in Madison."}
{"text":"lol @cynthia, if you don't like sriracha don't order it with hot sauce.  great food"}
{"text":"Great little place.  They only do little dumplings but they do them well.  Great for a lunch or after some partying.  Seating is available but limited by the small space.  

Only thing missing for those who recall the old State St. location is the vinyl records to chose from, otherwise its great to have them back downtown."}
{"text":"F#ck YES I love that stuff !!!
Can I say f#ck on yelp ? I guess if i use the #
Paul's Pel'meni gives me a stiff Fooner, that's a food boner .
That food is a great part of Madison I love it !"}
{"text":"It is really hard to position this pel'mennaya relative to peers, given most of them are 4K + miles away. Still, it is doing things right. For those western-folk who say the menu should be expanded, I say say no! The beauty of the pel'mennaya is that it only makes pel'meni. It feeds the muzik on his way to the factory, the bomzh, who found 10 kopeks on the street. It is simple. It is pure. It is the very definition of uyut.

Paul's meets these criteria and adds just enough curry and cilantro to make its own mark."}
{"text":"1 hour and 15 minutes after I placed my order it arrives, and it's the wrong order.  I call and I'm told that \"there's nothing I can do, you'll have to call our delivery service.\"   \"They must have told me the wrong order then, because that's what they told me you wanted.\"  I call the number he gives me and it's the wrong number. 

After paying a $4 delivery charge, $1 convenience fee.  Good thing I tip in cash and didn't pre-tip... 

So, no refund, cannot find the number for Madison's delivery service, etc."}
{"text":"Oh you little perogi nibbles of potato & meat happiness. I think you tasted so good for lunch today, but I really wish you had been dazzled with a little bit of bacon married with some sautéed onions in bacon fat with a dash of smoked paprika. And maybe some toast."}
{"text":"Good, simple eating. This shop has potato and meat pel'meni, and both types of dumpling are delicious. You can choose to have all meat, all potato, or a mix of the two. The dumplings are served with sour cream on the side, and you can optionally get the dumplings with \"the works\". Trust me - you want the works. Say the magic words and they will dust your dumplings with transformative curry powder and cilantro, then give them a hearty dousing of melted butter and Sriracha chili sauce. If that doesn't sound good to you... just give it a try.

You can order the dumplings in half or full sized orders. The full size is a good, solid meal at a good price. The half size is good for a snack, or as a complement to another small meal. Drinks are $1, and there are a good variety of choices available. There is also a full bar in the establishment now, so you can order beer or a mixed drink to go with your dumplings if that is your preference.

Overall, good food served fast, and for a good price. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"simple. really yummy cheap flavorful food. I honestly don't know what we did to deserve Paul's. 

-good for drunk snack
-good for sober snack 
-just get potato if you're vegetarian
-with the works is the best"}
{"text":"i love thw dumplings.  either the work with beef or potatoes are great.  how i know? errr... i ordered both and ate them all.   lol. yummy."}
{"text":"They do one thing and they do it well. SO WELL. Delicious, quality, authentic dumplings! Don't be conservative go for the full order! And I'd suggest variety is the spice of life - get the mix of meat & potato."}
{"text":"If you like pelmini, which are similar to pierogi or ravioli, this place provides a good portion of them at a fair price.  It is a great option for a simple meal."}
{"text":"Bomb. Always. Seriously, quit debating and just go. Service is quick and the food is consistently delicious. I'm not Russian but close enough and this is pretty authentic. Get the mix your first time and then go from there."}
{"text":"When I heard Russian dumplings I didn't quite think it would be like a Chinese dumpling--water boiled wrapper enveloping meat. My dining companion said it wasn't fair to compare cuisines, so I am writing objectively about their characteristics. The dumplings were about the size of a quarter, the wrappers were kind of tough, and the meat to dough ratio is approximately 1:1. The sauces were tasty though. Also, \"mix\" does not mean beef mixed with potato filling one dumpling. It means half of the dumplings will be beef and the other half will be potato. So if you're sharing, you never know what you're going to get. Overall decent but I wouldn't seek this out in particular."}
{"text":"Yes this definitely should be on your list of must go-to while in Madison. Everyone always goes to eat pizzas after late night drinking but this is where it's at. Their food isn't as much for like dinner meal portions but it's a nice snack with a reasonable price. 
If it's your first time I'd I with the mixed larger size to get a taste of both the potato and beef dumplings."}
{"text":"Thanks for steering us to this great find Yelpers! Had the mixed (beef & potato) with the works. Delicious! Definitely recommend the works unless you're a total spice wimp. My 10 year old devoured them & didn't think they were too spicy at all. Yum!"}
{"text":"Paul's Pel'meni is a perfect example of a place that knows precisely what they're good at, and presents it with confidence and warmth. While a plate full of potato and/or beef dumplings might not sound like an exciting set of options at first, you soon see that Paul's has found a perfectly balanced, unforgettably tasty way of preparing the little bundles, and doesn't try to overwhelm you with options. Portion and flavor were perfectly offset by one another, and you finish your meal incredibly satisfied (and sad, of course, that it's over). So jealous that Madison gets to delight in this small wonder all the time, while visitors like me can only hope our cities wake up and add similar options."}
{"text":"It's probably a good thing I don't live in Madison. This place is way too good. Yes, it's only dumplings, but that's the point! And they're so good they scare me! I got the mix with the works and wanted to eat there at every meal. The guys working in there were nice, as well. I read some reviews that stated that the employees weren't nice, but I had a great experience.  I got a window seat and enjoyed watching people walk by while I enjoyed my fabulous food at an affordable price."}
{"text":"\"If you're not a vegetarian, you need to try mix with the works\" is what I was told my first time going in and I'm hooked. Add the Sriracha vinegar too"}
{"text":"Nice place. It's fun and laid back and I could totally see myself slamming down drinks and chatting over dumplings here if I was in college or wanting to watch a sports game.

The thing is the dumplings don't have much flavor in themselves, they need the sauces that come with it and the sauces make it taste pretty balanced. It's very interesting - the price is fairly cheap too for 5 dollars you get a half order of dumplings."}
{"text":"Wait, have I really never reviewed Paul's Pel'meni?

It's as simple as this: $7 for a full plate of tasty deliciously spiced Russian dumplings.

Maybe I'm too cost-conscious, but I've always found the deliciousness and consistency to be impeccable for the price point. If you don't like the spartan interior (and I admit that I've never been terribly fond of the joint itself), you can also chill with Paul's Pel'meni served at The Oasis Cafe in Fitchburg.

I've tried to recreate this experience at home with frozen pel'meni and spices from Yue-wah, but it's just not the same. Paul's Pel'meni has reached texture and spice balance perfection."}
{"text":"One of the best places in town. Not your average dine in place but still cozy and the food is delicious! Thank you so much for bringing this into Madison."}
{"text":"So glad this place is back, missed the downtown location and always seemed to miss getting over to the EVP in Fitchburg in time. Not like you have many options, but get either beef or mixed with the works and an extra sour cream. Paul has been there the few times I've been to the new location and is very personable, definitely appreciates your business!"}
{"text":"They are very good at what they do!  The menu is simple - beef or potato dumplings, or both.  I prefer to get a mix, but I think the beef are my fave. :) I like to get mine with the works.  You go in, your order, your food comes out.  it's a small space but there's usually somewhere to sit.  Service is consistent, we will be back when the cravings hit!"}
{"text":"This place offers nice pelmeni (Russian dumplings with potatoes or potatoes and meat) with a spicy sauce. That's about it.

The pelmeni are nice, but it's a bit hard to go in a group, given the limited choice. The place is extremely cheap so that adds to the value."}
{"text":"I get the mix with the works and side of sour cream...delicious!!  You may want to order ahead of time because they get extremely busy at lunch but well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Over the last year, I've made extremely frequent visits to Paul's. The service has improved remarkably and I haven't been disappointed a single time. Keep it up, guys!"}
{"text":"Really good dumplings, the work sauce was great. I can't do strong spicy food but the sauce was perfect. They taste great with sour cream. I would suggest getting an extra sour cream."}
{"text":"I really wish I liked this place as much as everyone else seems to! The idea is great - find something you do well, and focus on that. The staff is super friendly and willing to chat with you when they're not too busy. The space is small but serves its purpose...seems like more of a take-out place than a sit and eat place though. But the actual food just didn't wow me, unfortunately.

The concept is just two types of little dumplings - potato and beef. And you can either get it with their seasonings on it or bare. I recommend the seasonings, just because without, I feel like the food is a little boring (even with it, it gets a little boring). I got the half-and-half option thinking it would be a little more interesting, and I still got pretty tired of the flavors about halfway through. The fillings are just very basic, and while not bad, they don't get me excited either.

Of course, for the price, you're getting a nice amount of food, so I can totally get why this would be a great choice for college students on a budget. But don't try to make a meal out of it unless you have no other choice...a snack once in a while, sure, but you'll get bored with it if you go too often or eat too much at once."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Russian food, and
WOW, pelmeni (Russian meat dumplings) is REALLY good. I tried a half order of ground beef topped with \"the works\" and it was served with sour cream. 

It was a little busy for a late Tuesday afternoon, but it was worth the surprise."}
{"text":"Something unique in Madison, and that's not easy to do. My kids love it too. The price is right and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Late-night dumpling eats at a great price. Snake around back after ordering for a good tap selection and good conversion from those at and behind the bar."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, fantastic food. Simple and delicious. Inexpensive and filling. I missed this place when it closed down, so many years ago, and it's even better now. This is a Madison staple."}
{"text":"College-y food.  Relatively cheap, and simple. One of my favorite foods when I visited here for EPIC training."}
{"text":"Tender puffs of dough that melt in your mouth. I keep chili sauce on the side but love it with sour cream or butter. Large portions and makes a great leftover meal."}
{"text":"This place changed my life. Seriously SO GOOD. I would eat here every day if i lived in Madison. Always happy people working and consistently putting out good dumplings. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed every bite of my half order (potatoe/meat) with the works along with a side of sour cream.  \"The Works\"  flavor is unique & delicious!   I highly recommend and look forward to my next visit to Madison...I will be back :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Very straightforward menu, two options, two sizes, a handful of toppings (but you should get the works!) and so so SO cheap. These are like mini dumplings and they are just so satisfying. I always get an extra order to go so I have extras when I'm home and already craving more!"}
{"text":"Randomly walked in off the street to Paul's last night and got a full order with The Works. My boyfriend and I split the order and it was plenty for a light dinner. Quick service from a one-man show. No frills, short menu, great food!"}
{"text":"The dumplings were very good, but I worry the sanitary standards are not up to par.  When I ordered, the worked took my cash, did not wash his hands and began preparing the dumplings.  I had read some reviews about the cleanliness so I was paying close attention.  This same worker still did not wash his hands and drained the dumplings, then used his bare hands to pick them out of the pot/strainer and put them in my to go box. Ick."}
{"text":"Such a weird little place but the dumplings are amazing. They have meat or potato and I always get \"the works\" where they put curry powder and chili sauce on the dumplings. This is one of my favorite late night restaurants."}
{"text":"Dear Pelmeni, how I have missed you.  It's been a good many years since you were in town and the fact that you're back pleases me to no end. 

Meat or potato dumplings sounds boring, right?  Wrong!  If you've never tried Pelmeni you are totally missing out.

By mistake I got a 1/2 & 1/2 full order with the works (butter, yellow curry, sweet chili sauce and cilantro with a side of sour cream).  I had intended to only get butter but I'm very glad I ended up with the works.   The flavors are like a party in my mouth with just enough kick. 

Yes it's just meat or potato dumplings but the price is right and they will blow your mind!

Welcome back to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I can see the appeal: open til 3 am on weekends. But...the food is not anything special at all. Mini dumplings steamed and powdered with curry and sprinkled with siracha sauce. Then they give a cup of sour cream. ??? Are these supposed to be polish food? Asian food? Anyhoot That's pretty much the entire menu. You can have less flavor if you desire...(no curry or no siracha) 

if you are drunk at 2:00 am this place is probably awesome."}
{"text":"I stopped by Paul's for a snack and I wasn't disappointed. They serve Russian-style dumplings in a small take out joint off State Street. Their menus is small (pretty much just a choice between meat or potato dumplings). I got a small plate of a mix of potato and beef, and I would say the beef dumplings were slightly better. 

The dumplings themselves were a mix between Chinese style dumplings and Polish pierogis. If you're adventurous, be sure to order your dumplings with \"the works\" - it includes two kinds of curry, butter, cilantro and sour cream, all at no extra cost. The flavor was unusual though not unpleasant, imagine a mix between Mexican and Indian cuisine, with a good helping of Eastern European. I've never tried Russian food and the ethnic restaurants in Madison are notoriously average, so I was glad to eat something with a decent level of spiciness. 

Of course, if you don't care for spice, I'd stay away from the curry dressings, but even by themselves Paul's dumplings are top notch."}
{"text":"I get that there's a cult following for this place.  Some of my friends that moved away like to come here when they're in town.  Fair enough, they do the dumplings really well and they garnish them intelligently.  I wouldn't mind though if there was a third choice every now and then.  Maybe a mushroom or spinach or something.  Then again there are a lot of restaurants with 30+ things on the menu and I've still only ever ordered one thing.  Overall this is a very solid choice for lunch.  Parking is usually available in the lot across Gorham."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place. Such a gem. The menu is simple and the flavor is anything but. So much flavor and deliciousness in one meal. Go full order mixed with the works. The place is clean, the works are efficient but they are also sociable and really cool. They seem like they like their job. Whenever I've had a hard week or think I deserve it,  I treat myself to Paul's :)"}
{"text":"Some places bite off more than they can chew; not at Paul's. The menu has 1 thing - Pelmini's - meat or potato. period.
These small little stuffed dumplings are then covered in butter, cilantro, sriracha,  and curry sauce; sour cream is also an option. The taste explosion is beautiful and fulfilling. 
The space is tiny and tables space is limited, it took us 2 visits before we could dine in. 
Paul's Pelmini please come to Kansas City!"}
{"text":"Before visiting friends in the hospital (to celebrate the birth of their first baby), we stopped at Paul's for a half order of potato pel'meni (there were about 20 small dumplings for $4.50).

I have been on a hunt for a great dumpling in Madison for a while. I am a gyoza lover and all-around dumpling zealot. But, I hadn't found one that really floated my boat, until Paul's. The outside of the potato dumpling is a little chewy, and the inside is creamy/delicious (akin to a gusher for adult tastes).

I can only speak for the potato dumplings--go for them, and get 'em with the works."}
{"text":"YUM DUMPLINGS!
Paul's is my go to when I am not sure what I want, I don't want to pay a lot and I don't want to eat something that is terribly unhealthy for me.
The dumplings can be made in full or half portion, and mixed types of dumplings, (ie. potato and meat), or single type of dumpling. I always go for the mixed and still can't decide which is my favorite.
Always get the works, because the flavor of the curry with sriracha is amazing! 
Cons: Sometimes there is a bit of a wait, but I prefer waiting versus having cold dumplings that have been waiting for me ;)"}
{"text":"So good. A little off the beaten track, but worth it. Love it so much, I want to order double when I go there."}
{"text":"I'm torn. I used to be a regular at the old location since it was easily accessible and laid back, but am really not a fan of the new place. It's got to be great for the late night state street crowd, but if you're driving it's much harder to get to. Since they opened up the new shop, the pelminis almost don't seem fully cooked. They're drier and chewier. One time I even had one that was crunchy. I'm hoping these are growing pains but I truly miss the old Paul's."}
{"text":"Pel'meni - aka filled gnocchi or tiny perogis.

They are putting out some really nice, handmade food for a great price, and they are a local staple in Madison (resurrected from years past). 

We tried the mix of potato and meat which was good, but I might go meat only next time. For toppings, you can choose butter, sour cream, sriracha, curry, and cilantro (the works is all of the above). Personally, I liked the pel'mini in butter mixed with sour cream/sriracha. 

I'd make this a favorite if they would offer some kind of sauces or more toppings, because there are limited combinations now."}
{"text":"YUM. I love this place. I live downtown and when it's chilly out, I love hitting up Paul's for some comfort food. I always get a full mix with the works -  their dumplings are seriously so good. They stick to one thing and they do it well."}
{"text":"What happen to dumps!

It moved? Why?!?

The new location is nasty! I'm confused why dumps needs a bar?

I was served over cooked water down trash.... honestly ZERO flavor, at least a 1/8 cup of water in my bowl when served. 

I waited 25 mins for 3 orders of dumps with only one other couple in the entire place.  

I'm disappointed in the change of location, , staff and overall crappy service.

A lot of other reviews have concern about the cleanliness of the staff.... I would agree. Bunch of super pot heads that don't like to wash there hands. Using cell phone while making dumps. 

I like to say I'm a long time Paul Pel'meni fan! But, this is a turn for the worst. I will no longer being going back due to my terrible experience today and I'm sadden by how this place has turned into another crappy downtown bar! 

In the end, check it out if you like crappy bar experience food. No longer has that hidden gem feel"}
{"text":"Oh Paul's! My favorite late night haunt. All you need to know is \"full order mixed the works\". This order will provide you with a mix of meat and potato dumplings covered in delicious toppings including curry powder, vinegar, cilantro and sriracha. It is so good! A full order can easily feed two people.

I am only docking a star because the menu is small and it can be slow at certain times when it is busy.

If you like gnocchi, pierogi or dumplings come give Paul's pelmeni a try. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here with my family while in the Madison area. Was very curious to try Russian dumplings and they did not disappoint! We got a mixture of the beef and potato ones topped with the yellow curry powder, siracha and butter. Super delicious, especially the potato. The curry powder and siracha gave a nice kick to what could almost be described as mini perogies. The meat ones seemed a tiny bit watery and without the sauce didn't have much taste but other than that everything was delicious. They have a small seating area inside and the place was pretty crowded. I'll have to thank my brother (who lives in Madison) for the recommendation!"}
{"text":"Paul's Pel'meni has one thing on their menu and they do it well. For those who may not know what a Pel'meni is, it's the eastern European version of the dumpling. At Paul's you can get meat or potato or a mix. It can come spicy or not and with or without rye bread. It's the perfect treat for a cold wintery day. The restaurant ambiance is pretty modern but has the same straight forward convenience and sensibility of their menu."}
{"text":"I lived in Russia for a while and this restaurant offers a great remedy for nostalgia. Both the meat and potato pel'meni are delicious. Personally, I like the meat dumpling with all the fixin's best. Be sure to order extra sour cream! Actual restaurant is small and doesn't offer much in the way of seating, but perfect for takeout or delivery."}
{"text":"I played pool against the owner from here (Paul). I beat him, but good. Wiped the floor. Or the table, as it were. He then insulted me, my family, my country, my lack of religion, and then stayed mad at me all night. I guess you can conclude that Paul's a Pool-meanie.

What to get: Mixed Pelmeni
And what do you call it if your dude goes all over your fingernails: Pearl-mani

Billy Idol has been taken off the radio, btw. Not White Wedding or Rebel Yell, but they've decided to \"pull Mony.\"

If you're cruising Madison for cute college students (and there are many), make sure you Paul over when you see this place, because you'll be in for a real treat.

I had very, very low expectations for this place. I was absolutely shocked.

Indeed, this little Russian place was really amazing! They know how to season their stuff all the way to make it taste really good. I'm not a fan of bland stuff, and a lot of food (especially in college towns) can be bland. I don't think these Pelmeni would be as amazing without the seasoning.

The potato ones are nice, but a bit bland, and the meat ones have a little more flavour to them. But it's all the seasoning that makes it great.

Plus the fact that these are so original and unusual, and especially that they are so cheap, is a huge plus. Much like the flag of Switzerland is a huge plus. 

And I love that they do half orders as well for somebody like me, who doesn't want to fill themselves with unhealthy food. Whereas filling myself with unhealthy boys? I'm all about that.

Certainly this is the most innovative food I've had in Wisconsin, and definitely one of the highlights of eating in Madison - which granted isn't great - but this place is.

The guys are super friendly, and there's a bar attached to it on the inside as well. Now would you like to be attached to me on the inside?

And if you're going to take the skin off an orange, don't just do one. Peel many!"}
{"text":"Not exactly what I was expecting, but a unique food that was a ton of fun to try. For me, they tasted much better when I mixed in a little bit of sour cream. Careful though, mix in too much and you'll be getting cold bites of sour cream. You want those hot and fresh palmenis to stay hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"Pauls premini is a unique fast eat in Madison. Their dumplings are really tasty, huge portion, very fast, really hip staff, casual dining and does not break the bank. On a cold night especially this is a life saver and makes you stay warm for the rest of the night ! It opens until really late it's great for night owls and a small city where most eats clock out at 10."}
{"text":"This restaurant has one dish - dumplings.
You can have your choice of meat or potatoes or both!
Throwing some Sriracha + the works + sour cream is the way to go!

So simple, yet so good."}
{"text":"These are so good! I definitely suggest everyone try this place at least once! Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Tasty dumplings! Simple menu and terrific execution of the few items :)"}
{"text":"Great food and good service. I ordered the mixed with the works. It was my first time eating here and I will be sure to make a visit in the future. It was a nice option to grab on the go."}
{"text":"This stuff is amazing. One of my favorite 'simple' meals in Madison. Get the works and sour cream. I favor beef over potato or even a mix, but you can't really go wrong on that score."}
{"text":"Solid. 

This was my first experience with Russian dumplings, and I have to say--they were pretty good! Paul's is a tiny, no-frills place that churns out these little things like nobody's business.

For $4.50, you can get a small. $6.50 gets you a mix. You've got a choice of potato, beef, or mix. You can even get \"the works\" on them--butter, cilantro, sriracha and curry powder. I got the works. It was good, but I needed the sour cream to balance out the heat.

Overall, though? Quite tasty. It's like a cross between gnocchi filled with things and perogies. I enjoyed it. This place has \"drunk food\" written all over it, but they're only open until 9pm!

My advice? Extend your weekend hours to 1, 2am. It'll go a long way with business!"}
{"text":"I loved the old one soooooo much. 

The new version tends to undercook the dumplings, they are to sticky and doughy. Service and quality is not consistent at all. If they could properly cook the dumplings consistently, I would go all the time."}
{"text":"Paul's is solid.  Good, consistent, beautiful hot little bites of goodness.  I wouldn't say \"great\" but definitely 4 star material, and consistent as the day is long.  I love a restaurant that focuses on one item - with a short menu that doesn't require too much decision making."}
{"text":"Nice little place. It's my first time trying Pel'meni. The pelmeni is a lot smaller than Chinese dumplings and Japanese gyoza. To me, the proportion of wrapping and stuff is too big. In other word, the flour part is too much and there's not enough stuffing. Personally I'd prefer eating something with more meat wrapped!"}
{"text":"When this restaurants earlier version was open in 2003, I sometimes averaged 4 times a week and I know that is about to happen again! All they got is dumplings but they are inexpensive and out of this world! Large, mix, works!"}
{"text":"Hate to be a hater, but...

I wasn't really that impressed. Great prices, but just OK food and even crappier service. Yes, it's cheap, but so is McDonalds and I don't see anyone else getting their panties in a bunch over 20 chicken nuggets for $5?! 

-Went with the mix of the potatoes and meat and got the works. I'm a total carnivore, but I did prefer the flavor and texture of the potatoes over the meat. The meat dumplings were hard, overcooked, and a hot mess. I did like the seasoning combination of the curry powder, sriracha and cilantro. Cilantro makes everything better. 
-Got a half order and had to wait 10 minutes. You make all of ONE item, what's up with the wait? Even after waiting, our dumplings weren't piping hot like they should have been, but they were lukewarm at best. 
-Like I said, service sucks here. Apparently you need to rattle off your order military style, or else you'll just have one very annoyed server. Again, they still only serve ONE item.
-Friend and I both got the works, but peculiar enough, we both didn't get any sour cream in our order. Didn't think too much of it at the time, but now I see that we should have gotten our sour cream on the side. For the third time, they still only serve ONE item, how hard can it be?

These dumplings are such cute little suckers, and in theory are such a great alternative to getting a quick burger or the like. But let's be real here, the dumplings themselves lack so much in execution and thus isn't really any much better than grabbing food at any other fast food joint."}
{"text":"Speedy & friendly service, along with such delicious potato dumplings! And so cheap! I would go back in a heartbeat. Perfect for the local college students on a budget."}
{"text":"Great drunk food, I don't hit it often but it's usually packed after bar close and the delicious dumplings are a unique and fun alternative to Ian's etc.... I would not fuxk Paul over Dotty though...."}
{"text":"I came here to try their pelminis.  We got the mix of beef and potato with all the sauces (curry and sriracha).  The curry is a powder sprinkled on and the sriracha is drizzled on top.  It is a pretty good mix, you can also dip it in sour cream which is on the side.  Definitely a great quick meal that doesn't break the wallet.  They also have a bar and happy hour specials, definitely perfect for the college students nearby."}
{"text":"My meal at Paul's Pel'meni was my first time sampling Russian dumplings and I'm glad that I did! I shared a full order of the mixed dumplings with my friend and we both left the restaurant nice and full! 

The next time I return to Paul's, I plan to order only the meat dumplings; both types were good, but the meat ones were so juicy and flavorful that my dining companion and I found ourselves racing each other to finish the most of the meat dumplings. They are so yummy! 

The dumplings at Paul's are made even tastier by the wonderfully balanced condiments that top them; I especially loved the hot sauce.

These dumplings are definitely worth a try when you are downtown!"}
{"text":"Update to my prior review, they're now offering black bread for 50 cents for a whole slice.  So good, authentic and worth it.  

Paul's is also accepting cards in addition to cash now!"}
{"text":"From the couple times i've been here, I can say that i'm a big fan.  They only serve two dishes:  Dumplings with beef, or dumplings with potatoes.  I think the potato ones are delicious, and my friends who got the beef both loved it.  You can get it plain, or with \"The Works\" (for no extra charge!), which is yellow curry, sour cream, butter, and chives I believe.  It makes the dumplings taste even better.  Also, these dumplings are cheap:  Only $4.50 for a half order, or $6.50 for a full,.  As a man with a gigantic appetite, I was pretty full after a full order, so they don't skimp on the portions.

Paul's is one of my top choices to get lunch in the State St. area, along with a couple of the food carts.  It's because they're one of the only places in the area to serve dumplings, and they do it quite well."}
{"text":"A friend and I were going to have lunch at Paul's Pel'meni today.  After seeing the lack of sanitary food handling by the lone employee, we decided to eat elsewhere.  Getting a case of gastroenteritis was not on my \"to do\" list.

I watched the employee handle greens and other food items with his bare hands.  I then saw him take a few orders, handle the cash, use the credit card machine, and answer the telephone.  He then went back to handling the food with his bare hands without washing them.

My friend and I were at the restaurant at 1PM on a weekday.  There were only a few people in there and only one person working.  With such an appalling  lack of sanitary food handling, I can see why there were so few customers.  I would never consider eating here after what I saw."}
{"text":"Yes, they only have dumplings, but they are delicious dumplings!  This was a great find while I was visiting Madison.  I read other yelp reviews and decided I needed to give it a try. I'm glad I did.  I ordered 1/2 order of the mix (1/2 ground beef and 1/2 potatoes) with the works.  I actually expected more toppings on it, but it was still tasty. Not big enough to really be a meal but definitely a good snack!  I'll come back again the next time I'm in town and snack on a full order."}
{"text":"There's little else I can say beyond reiterating the fact that this is the best lunch deal anywhere near downtown or the east side of campus. (OK, a tie with Med Café!) It's cheap, filling, and tastier than any number of sandwich chains nearby. Perfect for a hearty meal on a snowy day. The staff is always quick and courteous to boot."}
{"text":"A lot of people will say, \"dumplings? Who eats dumplings?\" Those are the people raised on dinosaur shaped frozen chicken nuggets. This shit is fast and delicious. It is the epitome of drunk food, but they're still great during the day. The quality and consistency have always hit the mark, the staff is friendly, and it's pretty cheap. Drop a tenner and share with a new friend from The Plaza right across the street.

The only thing that Paul's Pel'meni gets wrong is that old Pel'meni had a record player and boxes of records to jam out to. I figure that if I keep asking them for the record player back they might actually do it..."}
{"text":"There are tons of different varieties of dumpling depending what country your speaking of. When I first heard a dumpling place was opening. I wasn't to thrilled. I've had all the different Asian kinds and some. Potato dumplings? Really...sound yummy.......yeah right. Who are we kidding.

Well I was wrong once I saw pictures & heard they come with hot sauce & curry powder! Big lover of both here but more for the first. I had to get ASAP.

They didn't disappoint. I got the half order of the Mix with the works. The filling of both the meat and potato are dense. Not minced, loose filling in other kinds of dumplings. Also smaller in size. The side of sour cream was the icing on the cake. Bring everything together. The hot sauce was not hot at all, but I'm speaking for myself who can eat ghost peppers.

Can eat then in the shop or get them to go and walk State St. The place was clean, employee was welcoming and the food came out in a timing matter with how busy they were. Can only imagine how much more busy it will be since its only the beginning. Hopefully this isn't a hype and stands strong."}
{"text":"There's not much to say that hasn't been said in other reviews, but this place is good, cheap eats. The Pel'meni aren't big as the ones I've had at Ukrainian joints elsewhere but they are every bit as tasty."}
{"text":"Mini dumplings, yum!! I had to check out the pelmeni here, and we stopped by right when they opened on a Saturday, so it wasn't busy at the time. I tried the Beef & Potato Pelmeni The Works (Butter, Yellow Curry, Sweet Chili Sauce, Cilantro, Sour Cream, $5/Half Order, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=RCx8NIuTuhDI0ItX8XQ1Yw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg), which was delicious, and SO filling for only $5!! I liked both the pelmeni since the beef had a good flavor, but the potato was super fluffy. The works is definitely the way to go, since everything worked really well together. I would definitely recommend stopping by here to check them out if you haven't had pelmeni before! Parking downtown wasn't too bad early on a Saturday morning, since they're a couple blocks removed from the giant farmer's market."}
{"text":"Really nice convenient place. $5.00 for a half order of the Pelmeni. I had the beef with the works."}
{"text":"Man, I really didn't want to like this place. And I don't really want to give them 5 stars but it is a must try.
I was put off by the lack of cleanliness and the fact that the big guy at the register was handling money and going out for a smoke to come back in and use his bare hands to scoop out dumplings from one bin to another. and they had a broom right there at the prep area that I would assume was used recently-why would you otherwise have it sitting right there?
These things are delicious! 
I got a full order Mixed with the works and I do not regret it one bit. Ok, well maybe a little...as it was way to much to consume in one sitting (for me-my tummy actually hurt). But my mouth was in heaven. Nice flavor and texture. I can see coming here again especially since I am 24 hours out and I have not died...haha.
Very college area-hole in the wall feel with a bar in the next room."}
{"text":"First visit today and loved every bite. The pelmeni is simple and delicious, service was fantastic even in the thick of the lunch rush, and there's just a great vibe to the place. Not light eating by any stretch but a killer deal for good, real food. Definitely on my \"often\" list."}
{"text":"Paul's is a neighborhood staple and the dumplings are simply delicious. I always get the potato with the works and even a half order is filling, but the more the better. I love that they serve one thing and do it amazingly. I am so excited to see that they've expanded in their new location. A must eat in Madison!"}
{"text":"Dumplings with meat, cheese, topped with melted butter, hot sauce, minced cilantro, yellow curry on top, and a side of sour cream. Can you say delicious? This has everything I love in one dish.

I love them, where have these been all my life?"}
{"text":"Easiest menu to navigate! meat or potato or get both kinds of dumplings.  

As a first timer, we got the full order of mixed meat and potato dumplings with the \"works.\" It confused my culinary senses with the yellow curry power, butter, and chili sauce on Russian dumplings with sour cream on the side....but it all \"works\" together somehow."}
{"text":"One of the hidden gems of Madison. Beef dumplings were already my favorite food and Paul's lives up to my expectations."}
{"text":"AWESOME dumplings! We got the mix with the works. Very hot, made to order, insanely fast service, and they have sparkling waters!"}
{"text":"Loved these dumplings!  Definitely get the full order mix with the works.  Super cute little pillows of deliciousness!"}
{"text":"I had a great lunch here recently.  Got the works, which gave some good flavor.  I'm always a fan off places that do few things, but do them well.  My one gripe was that I though the meat dumplings were basically meatballs with the dumpling crust."}
{"text":"Delicious dumplings. I always do the potato. And make sure to get the works with it as well. They are often open late night which is really cool if you're like me and are hungry after a night of drinking but don't want to eat pizza or other fast food. Always very friendly service and very fresh food."}
{"text":"My to-go place for comfort food. I always get the beef option instead of potato. Because you can really feel the juicy, fatty taste of the beef which go really well with all the sauce. I always have it with cream cheese because it helps balance the fattiness of the beef. This is not authentic Russian dumpling though because the sauce has a hint of Asian cuisine in it. Regardless it is very delicious and cheap"}
{"text":"Came to Madison for the first time this past weekend. When my boyfriend told me he wanted to get \"russian dumplings\" for dinner, I was a little surprised given all the other great foods I knew Madison had to offer. The second I tried one of these, I was sold. These are the most delicious things I've ever eaten. So many flavors in one small bite! 

I got a full order of both potato and beef with the works- so ridiculously good! And they are so cheap! I hope I can find something similar in Chicago. I cannot wait to go back to Madison for these!"}
{"text":"I give this a 4 because it's unique, so I think it's fun! It's a pretty small space but I like the casual layout. It isn't what I expected for a russian dumpling place, especially because of the pop music playing in the background... the dumplings were deeelicious and the toppings were perfect! I can see myself craving these in the future..."}
{"text":"Just as good as the original State St location from back in the day.

Mixed dumpings, full order, with the works. Welcome back Pel'meni!"}
{"text":"Unique, simple, cheap, and tasty! This is such a special late night college food option. For $6.50, you can get a sizable take out box of little pierogies tossed in some sauces with a side of sour cream. Almost everybody gets the same order: mixed dumplings with \"the works\" which is when they top it with all of their sauce options. You may look at it and go like \"Sweet chili sauce and yellow curry on my pierogies? That's wild!\" Honestly, it is wild but this is what make this meal so unique.

The atmosphere is very fun too. When i was in there, they were playing Lindsay Sterling and the cooks looked like they were having a blast making dumplings. It kind of feels like a food truck with its own building.

Bottom line: Try something fun and new and go to Paul's!"}
{"text":"I always drive pass this restaurant, so one day I decided that I was finally going to try it and it was soooooo soooo good!

Parking: not too horrible, there's street parking and then there's a parking lot right across the street (yes, you have to pay.) There's also residential streets you can find parking at across the street. 

When you walk in: the restaurant is pretty small with not that many seating options, but I'm sure it's popular for its take out. The workers greet you mostly right away.

The menu: the menu is rather small - offering only Pelmenis (Russian dumplings) - either potato, beef, or a combination of both. It's topped off with cilantro and spicy sauce if wanted. 

The food: I ordered the combination of potato and beef pelmenis and every small bite of it was delicious! The spicy sauce makes the experience even better. 

Price: the pelmenis are definitely in the price range of a college student. No more than $10.

Overall, this place was amazing! I can't wait to come back to Madison and get some more pelmenis!"}
{"text":"Simply the best!!  Paul is one of the hardest working restaurateurs in the city and it shows in the quality of the food and of his establishment.
Treat yourself!"}
{"text":"People seem to like the dumplings a lot, so I tried it a couple times. They have a small menu (can only order two types of dumplings). I wasn't into them but I know a lot of my friends are. It's worth trying! The dumplings are definitely interesting and the staff is friendly! It is a personal taste opinion that I didn't like the dumplings but don't let that stop you from trying them!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! They on serve dumplings, your choice of beef, potato, or a mix. Get \"the works\" with it (it's a spice combo of curry powder, oil, cilantro, and some other forms of heat). It adds a great flavor to a simple, but tasty dish.

You can eat outside or at the bar. 

Nice people work there...

Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Dumpling is all that they have.  Now they are very good, but they could make sauces or toppings from scratch.  The toppings were hot sauce, curry powder, cilantro,  vinegar and sour cream.  Nothing actually made there. Also the server, who is also the cook is very nice but his loud music did not accompany the good very well."}
{"text":"I actually first had Paul's when a roommate got takeout for the whole house to share. This convinced me to give this place a visit and see what options there were, though it seems that I already tried their entire menu in the two takeout boxes the first time around. 

As most people here say, get the dumplings with the works and the sour cream. Yes, that's curry powder and sriracha sauce, but when combined with the sour cream the flavor really works. I'm not sure if will rise above anything other than a novelty, though. I probably won't make this place a regular, even though I don't think it's bad. It's just a one-trick pony."}
{"text":"Good food, awesome staff, I just wish the place was a little bigger."}
{"text":"Came in because of the great reviews, wasn't disappointed. Super hearty comfort food with a very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Called. Put on hold. In hold for 20 minutes. Hung up, called back. No answer. No answer. Just wanted to order food, but after 30 minutes l, gave up. Terrible, horrible customer service. When I was on \"hold\" I could hear the workers talking.  They weren't busy and apparently just forgot the phone was on the line."}
{"text":"Our Second round here and yet again they nailed it! Love this joint an Highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"I went to the new pelmeni place having been a frequent customer at the State Street location a few years ago. Was miserably disappointed by the time I walked out of the door (45 minutes after walking in).

I think I can attribute everything wrong with the current into two words: The employees. I went on a Saturday late afternoon, and the two guys working behind the counter were as slow as they were incompetent. As my friends and I waited, the two guys continuously botched order after order in slow motion. Eventually one of the employees made himself some pelmeni, threw them in a box, and peaced out. 

By the time our order came (over 30 minutes after ordering), the dumplings were both room temp and undercooked. I hated myself for eating them.

While this place has most of the potential of the last place (would like the sour cream fridge back and also change the hot sauce back to whatever it was), the current Saturday afternoon iteration was a joke. 

In the future, I will either buy them frozen there (assuming they can't botch that order), or just not go at all. Totally bummed about my experience!"}
{"text":"Makes me wish I was Russian. This has to be one of the best places we've found on our road trips. Not a lot of choice, they just do one thing and do it really well. The laser focus on the quality and flavors ends up tasting like \"I've never had this before\" and \"I feel like I've been eating this my whole life.\" We were welcomed by Bowie on the stereo and warm potato pillows snuggling spicy sweet sour flavors and I will be back."}
{"text":"Aaaah...nostalgia.  Pel'meni went away for a little bit in the 2000s, but overall it's been in Madison for years.  Simple concept, good execution. You get either potato only dumplings or a meat and potato mix.  Nothing else except rye bread as an optional side.  Best to eat immediately before they clump.  It's fast, fresh, and fills you up! 
Occasionally I feel like it takes an unusually long time to get the dumplings.  It's prompt, but the noodles are steaming in the pot all the time, so preparation involves simply putting the dumplings in a container and adding sauce and cilantro.

 You won't go wrong with dumplings as a fast meal!"}
{"text":"My (abbreviated) guide to happiness:

1)  Order the half and half (while the beef filled are better than the potato, they go great together)

2) Be sure to order them with \"the works\". Who knew this mixture of curry, cilantro, sweet chili sauce, and a side of sour cream could taste this good?

3)  When you get to the table, grab the delicious hot sauce bottle and give a couple of squeezes.  Eat

4)  Leave happy"}
{"text":"This place is my new comfort food. It's better than any fast food and often cheaper. As of December 2015 it's been a touch off. I suspect new workers. They seem to be going light on the Sriracha and the potatoes are too mushy. Still, it's my go to food when I don't want to cook and just want something cheap and easy. It's also a favorite amongst my friends so we can always quickly settle on drunk food.

If you haven't been here I'd really recommend extra works if you like spice. If you hate it, go with extra sour cream like everyone else says. In my opinion going with just meat or potatoes is too much of one texture and mixed is the way to go. Definitely make sure to eat it when fresh or they clump and it's hard to mix it up properly. 

Otherwise it's super basic. Get a full order with the works, mix in the sour cream, and enjoy."}
{"text":"Came here very very late on a Saturday evening after a concert and a night out. We were lucky to beat the even later rush that happens around 2AM. This place is a very simple one with only 2 (or 3) options on the menu, which make it very easy to decide. There are potato, beef, or mixed options. I chose the whole mixed and received a small brown box with about two rolls of pillowy potato or beef (depending on the bite!) filled pelmeni. The curry powder gives it a nice kick and the cold and creamy sour cream really somehow just works so well with the dish. There is an option for drinks and rye bread (which I personally felt didn't really go with the dish). My few complaints would be that the portions are pretty limited (I'm not sure how full bigger eaters would get even with a full serving) and it is pricey for the serving size. In addition, too much of one thing may be a bit monotonous. However, overall this is the perfect late night food people are usually looking for and it is satisfying and quite tasty."}
{"text":"Great experience with this place!  We both ordered the loaded full and we're happy with it!  Great place for lunch.  Minimal seating available.  I will be back for sure!  Yum!"}
{"text":"The food was good but that wasn't the issue. I ordered beef pol'meni and potato because my girlfriend is vegetarian. We picked up the food and when we got home we discovered that we got two orders of beef instead. Ok, so no problem right? We call back and clear it up and were told to come on in and pick up the all potato. We get there and the employee at the register is great: he was friendly and was really cool. The woman who prepared the replacement not so much. She was incredibly rude and when we got home we discovered that she only gave us a half order instead of the full order I originally ordered."}
{"text":"I don't wanna be a copycat, but I agree with Bobb and Corey:

1. Get the half-and-half with the works (when it mixes together...mmmHM), and
 
2. I wish the menu was just a little more expansive and diverse. Paul's does pel'meni RIGHT, but I feel like that talent would also make some awesome salads, soups, or desserts. Don't get me wrong, I don't think a huge menu is the right choice for this place - but another option or two wouldn't go amiss.

Otherwise, though? Love it. Delicious food, great service, even greater price."}
{"text":"A Madison staple. I've never been let down here, carry-out or dine-in. I rave about these guys to anyone with ears."}
{"text":"Delicious food, and what a great staff. Eat at Pel'meni, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"On any frigid, nose-numbing, teeth-chattering Wisconsin winter day, Paul & his gilded pel'meni can be counted on to efficiently & deliciously warm the belly, soul, and possibly even the loins with his particular brand of expertly spiced & stuffed dumplings (get the works). 
One sentence review!"}
{"text":"It's just the dumplings but they are very tasty...if that's what you're looking for.  If not, you're screwed...but now you've read this so you know.  : )
My spouse was less thrilled...and it perhaps wasn't the most romantic date night option, but I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and the staff was super friendly and helpful (because I clearly didn't know what the hell I was doing.)"}
{"text":"Place is set up to be more of a bare bones take-out type deal rather than a sit-down situation. You might be surprised that the portions seem somewhat small, but trust me, a full order is very filling. Mixed is my favorite, every time I have gotten only meat it was too salty."}
{"text":"Not my favorite dumpling place in Madison. Despite all the good reviews, I was really disappointed.

I'm giving Paul's 2 stars because I didn't enjoy this food at all.

Take this with a gain of salt, because this place does have an overall rating of 4.5 stars, so clearly I am the odd ball.

I got the mix of beef dumplings and potato dumplings with the works.

What I did not like:
1. The potato dumplings are low in flavor and mostly just taste like mushy garlic. By the end I felt like I was playing dumpling roulette and losing every time I got a potato dumpling instead of a beef dumpling
2. The filling of the beef dumplings is really firm and I did not like that texture at all. However, the overall flavor was good.
3. The sauce is just curry powder with some sriracha. I like both of those things, but I felt like the dumplings did not pair well with this combo
4. This was an excuse to eat sour cream. I love sour cream, but not when I have to use as a band aid for a disappointing dinner.

the staff was friendly. They make your food to order, so it is pipping hot when it gets to you. Expect to wait about 10-15 mins for your order.

There is an art store downstairs, so if you get your order to go, you can peruse paints and canvases while you wait.

For great Asian dumplings and bao, I highly recommend Dumpling Haus in the Hilldale Mall."}
{"text":"Totally edible. This place is unbelievably okay. Not sure what type of high the rest of Yelp was on to give this place 4.5 stars. To all looking for an honest rating: average, decent, lunch worthy- but not every week, Wednesday food"}
{"text":"Saw this place on Campus Eats on BTN a while back and happen to be in town for a Hockey Tournament.  Wife and I went for lunch and split the Full Mix order loaded.  They were awesome!  Great comfort food at a OMG low price.  With drinks we were out for under $10."}
{"text":"I cannot believe it took me a year living in Madison to run into this place one warm summer and not so sober night. There is literally only two items on the menu and they are awesome little dumplings filled with either potato or meat, but the best is with both together. You cannot go wrong with the combo with the works. Skip Ians Pizza and try something that will give your taste buds a ride!"}
{"text":"Pel'meni was a staple of my college days and this was my first trip back to the land of tiny dumplings since the original shop shuttered some years ago. It's a simple, clean place (both in decoration and experience) - walk to the counter, pick meat, potato, or a mix, let them know if want \"the works\" (you do - I used to decline as a pickier young eater and had my world changed when I was accidentally served a dish with everything and chose to just eat it), and finally decide if you want a $1 beverage out of the case and/or a slice of rye bread. All options have tax included, which makes for easy transactions. 

On my last trip, the staff was really friendly and you could sense the chef's pride when he dropped our meals off at the table. It's a great experience from top to bottom, but the one-note nature of Pel'meni and its heavy dishes make for a very specific dining experience that you have to be in the mood for when choosing your destination."}
{"text":"Paul's Pelmeni does one thing and one thing only - Pelmeni... Bite size little dumplings. Your choices Ground Beef, Potato or Mix of both. I prefer the mix of both - it gives a nice variety of texture. Paul's Pelemini is delicious, consistent and cheap. As I said they do just one thing and do it really really well. The beef dumplings have a good chew, while the potato ones are nice and silky. The flavors are both rich and subtle. 

It can be a bit hard to find - but Paul's Pelmeni is worth finding. There is street parking and a city of Madison parking lot just across the street. It is located just a 1/2 block off State Street. 

The 1/2 order fills me up... But take the rest home. Make sure to order your Pelmeni with the works: Butter, yellow curry, sweet chili sauce, cilantro, sour cream. You owe it to yourself to eat Pelmeni. Great quick bite in a land of over cooked, over priced and pretentious burgers."}
{"text":"Hits the spot! I love the sour cream component as well. Go for the mix and get it with the works."}
{"text":"I think this is the place I miss the most after moving out of Madison (and Madison has a ton of great eats to offer, so that's saying a lot!) Paul's does one thing and they do it ridiculously well: steaming hot little pillows of dumpling happiness, covered in butter, sour cream, cilantro, curry powder, and Sriracha (whether you get beef, potato, or mixed, order yours with The Works! I promise you won't regret it). Paul's is right off State Street and open late every night-- including bar-close late on the weekends-- so it's the perfect place whether you're ready for dinner at a normal hour or you're a few drinks deep and hungry for a late late late night snack. The price is right considering approx 6 bucks will bet you a delicious full order of dumplings. Love me some Paul's!"}
{"text":"I wasn't familiar with the restaurant since, so I just saw a sign outside that said Gorham Dumplings and I went in thinking it would be asian pot-sticker type of dumplings. Which is not what this place is. All you really need is a half order & if you don't like spicy foods, just be warned. (you can choose your toppings).
Nice little find just off state street."}
{"text":"I cannot speak higher of Paul's. They offer such a unique but simple menu, and there is no other place I've been that compares to the simple joy that is Paul's Pel'meni. Great portion size, easy ordering, fun new atmosphere. Such a fun place and quick meal!!!! I love Paul's!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really love this place late night. The menu is limited, but the value and taste make up for it. Compared to other late night options in Madison this is healthy."}
{"text":"Such a unique, underrated place. Fast service and amazing food, unlike any other place around. Have introduced many of my friends and they all became immediately obsessed like me. For the full experience I recommend the mixed order with the works."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite quick eats in Madison! Recommended by a friend about 3 years ago, I stop by this place at least once a month or so (more when I lived in the Langdon area). The small menu makes it easy for newcomers to pick what they want, and is vegetarian friendly too. You can choose either potato, beef or a mix of both. Then they ask you if you want \"the works\" on it, which is curry powder, sriracha, cilantro and butter (GET THE WORKS). In about 10 minutes, your order comes out with a side of sour cream. 

When I first stopped by, my initial thoughts were that the portion was too small. I was wrong! They are really filling, especially if you eat them with sour cream. 

Great portion sizes, great staff and amazing food!"}
{"text":"I have never had pelminis before but man was it DELICIOUS! We were on our way back home but our flight got delayed for nearly three hours. So we decided to come to this place that my brother-in-law suggested. I got the mix of beef and potato and extra of everything!! Great price for the food!"}
{"text":"Paul's is best described as a hidden gem in Madison - it's easy for visitors to miss, but I recommend that you don't! The idea is simple...from the menu to the location and decor. Paul's only serves one thing and that's their pel'meni - either potato (my favorite), meat, or a mix, with a unique blend of toppings that's fully customizable (including curry powder, sour cream, chili, parsley, and butter). I think it's clever that Paul's has such a simple menu - they know what they're good at and they don't beat around the bush. Their dumplings are delicious, unique, and the perfect inexpensive snack whether you're a student, local, or visitor. 

The pel'meni are perfect to-go since the restaurant is an order-at-the-counter type of place, and I recommend that you grab them as takeout, as the restaurant itself is pretty rough around the edges. Pretty dark, rugged, and maybe a little dirty? If you like ambiance, it won't be for you. So grab an order to go and enjoy this little Madison gem!"}
{"text":"Super tasty. Super cheap. Don't expect to come here looking for variety. I got a mix of beef and potato with the works. I liked both the beef and potato equally, but I like things like dumplings and gnocci. Sour cream was key."}
{"text":"My college days predate the first iteration of Paul's Pel'meni, but my sister attended school here some years after I moved to Minneapolis and raved about the Russian dumplings they served. I never made it there before it went away.

Three years ago, I moved back to Madison and by the grace of all things holy in this here universe, Paul's Pel'meni is also back. It's a simple thing, really. Who knew?  Make some pillow-like noodles, fill them with potatoes or locally raised beef, steam them just right and garnish them with flavors one never knew could work so well together -- curry, cilantro, sour cream -- holy hell, this is heaven!

Having a clean place with a friendly staff is never overrated, either. The place was spotless, and that includes the restroom. How many places on or around the corner from State can claim that?"}
{"text":"This place sells one product, and that product is really good.  Why three stars?  Lousy execution.

First, let's get this out of the way: Paul's Pel'meni-- both beef and potato-- are excellent.  I'm a bit of a pel'meni purist, so I was skeptical about the toppings they put on the dumplings, but I've decided that they add a lot to the flavor.

However, there's a lot of things that annoy me about this place:

- When it's crowded on the weekends it can take 20-30 minutes to get your order filled.  That makes no sense.  You sell one thing.  There's no reason that you shouldn't be filling orders pretty much constantly.  Get bigger pots.  Get another burner.  I really don't get why this is so complicated.  And why do you always have two people working there?  It doesn't matter whether it's empty or packed, it's always two guys.


- When it's empty and I'm sitting 8 feet away from you, would it really be that hard to bring my order to me?

- A lot of times they serve you your pel'meni in a takeout box whether you're eating in or taking out.  But there are perfectly nice dishes sitting right in front of them.  Do you just want to avoid doing the dishes?  That's annoying and lazy.

- For the love of God, can I have a fork?  Pel'meni are a lot easier to eat with a fork than with a spoon.

Fix these things-- and they shouldn't really be hard to fix-- and this is easily four, maybe even five stars.  Again, the pel'meni are really tasty."}
{"text":"I studied abroad in St. Petersburg, Russia for eight months last year and seeing how pelmeni are Russia's answer to pasta I got to know them pretttty well. I went into Paul's with high expectations (I've been hearing people rave about the old spot on State St. for years) and was impressed. I chatted with Jen at the counter who explained how Paul had learned how to make the little dumplings from a fisherman in Alaska and used to ship them frozen to the old place on State. They developed a special combination of flavors (cilantro?!? hot sauce?!? CURRY?!) which has made its mark and is around for good. 

Jen explained that they use about 75% local ingredients including Black Earth meats, local potatoes, locally produced flour. I got mine without butter and sour cream which made it SPICY. My friend said that the dairy in hers balanced it out a bit. It's a good deal for a hearty meal made with local ingredients and I think my Russian babushka  would agree they taste pretty damn authentic."}
{"text":"PROS: Cheap prices, decent portions, hearty pel'meni
CONS: Wishes there were better toppings/sauces

The potato dumplings themselves were like little warm, fluffy pillows --- very satisfying. The topping they used, however, tasted odd and fast-food-like to me, in stark contrast with the yummy pel'meni. For the price, it's a pretty great deal, especially for students,  but I feel like the sauce/toppings have much room for improvement."}
{"text":"I can now understand why people describe Paul's Pel'menis as \"little bites of heaven.\" As cliched as it sounds, these tiny Russian dumplings were truly delicious and filling. When I walked in this tiny shop off Gorham, I was struck by how simple the decor and kitchen setup was. It's very bare bones, with a few tables and chairs. There is an industrial stovetop right next to the cash register with giant stockpots simmering away. 

The menu itself is as simple as the store: you have the option of potato, beef or mixed dumplings, half an order or a full order, and you can get them plain or with The Works. A half order is $4.50 and a full order is $6.50, tax included. I would highly recommend (as many others have also) getting the mixed dumplings with The Works. You'll get half a serving of potato and half a serving of beef dumplings, topped with curry powder, a sprinkle of cilantro, a drizzle of Sriracha, and a small cup of sour cream. The beef dumplings are bursting with juice and flavor, and the potato dumplings are a nice starchy contrast. They also have their own special sauce that is a mix of rice vinegar and Sriracha that you can add to your dumplings yourself. The sour cream cools your tongue down if it gets too spicy. 

They are now open til 3am on the weekends, a strategic move on their part as I imagine these tasty treats are a hit with drunk people."}
{"text":"This is a Madison classic that used to be on state street. I was very excited to see it is still around (but not on state anymore).

The works (some curry powder, cilantro, sirracha and sour cream) on top of the mixed order (something like $6.50 or 7) is a great deal.  Every time I get it, I think \"this isn't going to fill me up\" and then 10 minutes later, I need to take nap I'm so full.

The staff are also very very friendly."}
{"text":"My roommate and a few other friends of ours really hyped this place up a lot. I was excited, I was hungry, and I was eager for a warm, tasty treat.

But, unfortunately, I wasn't blown away when I finally took my first bite. I ordered the mixed, large, with all the works and it was sort of just a little bland. In particular, the potato pieces lacked almost any flavor and the seasonings on top didn't cling well to the pelmeni; maybe my dish was prepared in a rush since it looked like the wetness made the seasonings wash off and pool at the bottom.

I did add some sriracha on top eventually and that made it tasty but, truthfully, the pelmeni were just sriracha carriers at that point.

I did also get to try just the potato and just the meat versions from the others in my group. The meat was much tastier to me than the potato, with more saltiness and umami, but it was still rather dry inside and lacked the small bit of fattiness it needed to balance it out.

I might try this place again but I haven't really craved it."}
{"text":"I love Paul's Pel'meni! The very limited menu makes your decision easy to make. I usually get a mix of potatoes and meat with the works. I add Sriracha for a little extra spice. Good proportions, fast service, definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Visited them last March 2016, so we had to search for them a little yesterday while in town for the Badger game as they moved. New location is great with Bar added. Had a great visit with staff and learned so much about how business got started. Drinks, food and staff was great. Extremely friendly and accommodating. A must visit for Madison visitors."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for a flavorful snack or quick meal. A very simple and straight-to-the-point menu consisting of your choice of beef or potato filled dumplings (or both!) smothered in a variety of delicious spices and seasonings. You can add on extra sour cream on top of the sour cream that is provided with the order and/or some rye bread. 

I ordered a half order of the mix (both potato and beef dumplings) and asked for it to be covered in the works (all of their seasonings-- yellow curry, something butter, and something else). Sorry if that wasn't very helpful, but def trust that the flavors were jam packed. There's also a nice kick of spiciness, so if you're not a fan, grab some extra sour cream. Even if you do like the spice, the sour cream is a nice addition to texture.

The staff seemed really nice and helpful since it was our first time ever eating there. For the price, you absolutely get an excellent amount to eat and enjoy. The location is in a fairly busy area, mind you this is a college town. Restaurant is well kept and cozy. 10/10 would eat again."}
{"text":"The sauce for the works is pretty good - nice curry flavor, a bit of heat, even some fresh herbs. The rest of the pel'meni (the mixed) just doesn't cut it. The potato is lacking in flavor itself, and the meat is chewy. They needed the sauce."}
{"text":"Pel'meni, welcome back. 

I missed you. I was younger back then, and I know I was drunk a lot of the times when we met. Remember the State Street days? Remember your old record player you used to let me use? Good times, though not always times I was proud of. You probably saw me at my worst, back then. But I'm older now, and I've learned a lot. And I want you back in my life again. 

You're just like I remembered you during those years we were apart. I missed you. You are warmth and comfort to me. On the worst of days, you bring me joy.

***

You don't have to think much, with Pel'meni.  That used to be the charm, back when this little shop was a late-night bar stop on State Street. You can have beef filled dumplings, potato filled dumplings, or a mix of both. (I like to mix it up; both are great.) Small, or large.  Either size is cheap. There, wasn't that easy?

 Your choice of dumplings comes bathed in butter, dusted heavily with spicy yellow curry powder, drizzled heavily with Sriracha sauce, and served with a side of sour cream. You know, for when the corners of your mouth start to burn, with hot, sexy, buttery joy.

What can I say about Pel'meni's dumplings that has not already been said?  They are just... super. The bee's knees. The cat's pajamas. Unless you don't like spicy food, and then I don't care what you think, anyway. But I suppose you could order them without all the wonderful, delectable stuff on them. But that's just silly.

They are still open late many nights, at their new, slightly more mature location just off of State Street. It's a little hard to find if you don't know where it is, though. They suffer from a lack of signage. They share an entryway with an art supply shop, and it's therefore easy to walk past and never notice the restaurant. Especially with AJ Bomber's smell hovering in the air, you can easily miss the tell-tale aroma of yummy little curry dumplings. 

Go, get some. Heck, go nuts, have some delivered. You'll almost pay more for the exorbitant fee that Straight to Your Door aka Mr. Delivery service charges than for your actual food, of course. But it is SO worth it. It doesn't even matter if the dumplings arrive cold, they microwave up like champs.

Pel'meni is fantastic. You'll love it."}
{"text":"One of my favorites. Cheap and the food is consistently satisfying. You order at the counter and they bring it out to you. Menu is very simple but it's surprisingly amazing (beef and/or potato dumplings with different options for toppings). I prefer the mix (beef and potato) dumpling option, always loaded. 

Atmosphere is low-key but still downtown - so you can show up dressed as you are, and no one will care either way. 

Overall, recommend to anyone looking for a quick, cheap lunch  that's not just another boring sandwich or burger."}
{"text":"SO DELICIOUS, SO CHEAP, SO FULL

The sriracha, sour cream and butter they put on top when you get \"the works\" is absolutely delicious. Even better they are open after bar hours and are perfect late at night!! Everyone I have taken here has enjoyed it. You can get two full meals and drinks for $15. Totally awesome could not recommend it more"}
{"text":"I know a lot of people who love this place; from a flavor perspective, I mostly get grease and toppings. But the texture is good, and the prices are reasonable. Hard to deny, and open very late."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and very basic.  The menu is literally three things - potato and beef dumplings, or a mixture of the two.  Served with a side of sour cream and your choice of siracha, curry powder or cilantro on top (not quite fitting but whatever).  Simple, fresh and delicious.  A great and (relatively) healthy bartime alternative to gyros or pizza with alot of weird shit on top."}
{"text":"I started ordering from Paul's on EatStreet about a year ago and I'm always satisfied with the service and the food. My order always arrives on time or before the estimated delivery time and the food is always hot and fresh. I will continue ordering food from Paul's and have recommended it to many of my friends!"}
{"text":"I stumble through the nondescript doorway, searching for art supplies. I see no canvases, no markers, no paint brushes. I see nothing but wooden chairs and a lanky, long haired man singing to a hip soundtrack.

\"This is not art,\" I say aloud to no one in particular.

How wrong I turned out to be.

Having just journeyed an imposing 15-30 steps out of my way, I was obviously famished. I inquired about what I was looking at on a chalkboard menu. Pel'meni, it claimed. Which is clearly a made up word but my considerable exhaustion stepped with reckless abandon all over my fidelity to perfection in linguistic blah blah blah

\"I'll take it all,\" I spit through gritted teeth at the tree of a man.

\"Uh, just one?\" My constant and intense eye contact was clearly giving him pause. Good. I seize the upper hand.

\"What do you think, jack?\" I raise my eyebrow. Like The Rock. He must be terrified.

\"...sure. Potato, beef, or mix?\"

\"Tch. Yeah.\" More eye contact. I am the coolest person that has ever entered this establishment and I see the recognition of that fact wash over this human tower. He nods slowly, drinking in the majesty of the moment.

\"Okay. I think we'll just give you a mix, alright?\"

\"You got it, bub.\" I hit him with a quick wink to make sure we're cool. He knows. He gets it. 

A few minutes pass and I am given a modest brown container. The type of containment apparatus that Jesus himself would enjoy a made-up food from. It's not for me to draw that comparison, but I think it's important to note.

Inside are nestled a small group of what appear to be pasta. A first bite reveals they are filled with meats and potatoes and possibly sprinkled with love from another plane of existence. Do you remember that sound an old computer makes when you shut it down suddenly? A muted buzz followed by a sudden stop as just the cooling fan runs for half a second longer? My brain did that.

I'm told I sat in the Palmesteri'eni lobby for hours, a slight drool dribbling from my chin. The leaning tower of customer service occasionally entered my periphery, adding, \"oh, cool, man\" and then striding off.

My life changed that day. I now only measure time in two ways: before palemebticnejeendckjeni and after. I said there was no art inside that modest cookhouse. How wrong I was, friends. How wrong I was."}
{"text":"The wife took me here and I had no idea what we were in for other than \"they basically serve pirerogies, and you like those\" I loved this place. The menu was so simple, which makes it easy when trying new things. We ordered a \"mix\" with \"the works\" which includes butter, curry powder, sweet chili sauce, cilantro, and sour cream. The mix is half potato and half beef. The cashier was patient with us and the food came up quick for being made in the spot. It was such an interesting combination blending familiar Eastern European flavors with Asian and Indian. The prep line was clean and the guy working it was meticulous preparing and cleaning. He wasn't the owner, but you could tell he cared about the business. I think the buss bin was strategically placed within ear shot so he could ask everyone how their meal was and thank them for their business. When it was my turn, I complimented him on everything and shared that I was a first timer. He took the opportunity to tell me that everything is local including the curry powder and potatoes. Everything down to the flower was organic and the beef was GMO free (whatever the eff that means). The quality was high, the staff was super nice, and the price was right too! $9 gets a meal plus some to take home. $6 portion was just right for me, although I was jealous that my wife got enough to take home. A cold beer would have been nice and built a bigger check for Paul, but I'm not sure the cost of a liquor license would be justified for this place."}
{"text":"Never heard of pel'meni? Neither had until eating here. 

Paul's is a simple place. Order half or full, type of dumplings, and yes or no to the works. Add drink or slice of bread if you'd like. From time to time, simple menu options are nice. 

The dumplings are pretty tasty, and I recommend ordering the mix for the first time. Get the works (you won't regret it), and the full order is just right in regards to portion size. Staff were friendly. Wait time can depend on the busyness, however. If it's busy, be ready to wait for 15+ minutes. 

Fantastic and affordable food. Will return when I'm back in Madison!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from this place on a cool night in Madison when I just didn't want to the leave the hotel. I got the beef and potato dumplings with \"the works\" and they did not disappoint. I could only stomach about 1/2 my order, but they were spicy, filling and well worth the wait. If you order at the restaurant, the prices are decent and their hours are pretty good (open until 3am most weekends from what I hear) I can see why this place would be successful in a college town!"}
{"text":"A very chill place to eat good food for cheap. I came here with a friend and we stayed a good 1-1.5hr just chatting after we ate because it wasn't busy at all. 

Has a very simple menu, and a bar in the back. 

It doesn't look like much, and the bathroom isn't the cleanest but it honestly didn't matter because this place has a very nice vibe!! Dim lights and the music was great!! Played jazz and oldies and classics. Will def come here again :)"}
{"text":"They're not really like traditional eastern european pelmeni with the curry powder and all. It's really sort of like currywurst and pelmeni had a child. A tasty child. A full order of the mix with the works is the way to go. 

If you're veg, the potato ones are really solid so don't pass them up."}
{"text":"Yum. Satisfying--a half portion was an adequate lunch. Toppings on the side let you control amounts--but I can see why people get extra sour cream. Dumings needs some side crunch, maybe a picked veggie or two? Just a thought. Extremely nice and helpful staff on my first visit."}
{"text":"They only serve one thing but they serve it perfect. 

The Pel'meni (the beef in particular) is so wonderful! Get it with all of the fixings and you're in for an amazing combination of flavors. Picky eaters and unique food lovers alike would love these dumplings. 

They're cheap, too!"}
{"text":"My first experience was with the Original Pel'meni's in Madison. Ever since I walked in I have loved these dumplings. 

The food has been classed up. organic and Locally-sourced ingredients. it's a bit more pricey than the 5 dollars I paid in 2006., but the food is better. 

I order them with the works. The chili sauce isn't super spicey, and the sour cream helps cut the heat. The only thing missing is the rye bread, which they are working on. 

I was advised that they aren't as good when delivered or carried out, and that is partially true. the fresh dumplings tend to clump when they cool. This doesn't make them tasted any worse, mind, but it just means they have to have more seating.

Finally, they aren't open late like their original location. How am I supposed to get my drunk dumpling on?"}
{"text":"It was our first visit today - messed up our orders and no customer service. Dumplings were good quality but not as described (no cilantro comes with the works version). Hooked app isn't really a deal, just a free can of soda really."}
{"text":"Paul's blows me away every time. Fast, huge portions for the price, and consistently delicious. Contrary to other reviewers, I believe the creamy potato filled dumplings are superior to the beef. Either way, you have to get it with the works. Cilantro, curry, butter, a sweet chili sauce, with a side of sour cream. Especially delicious around 2 am."}
{"text":"I'm such a sucker for this place.  Started eating with Paul in 2002 on State St.  It's my favorite place in Madison...  I even choose it over high-end dining."}
{"text":"Not a lot of choices here.  Comes down to full/half order, meat/potato/mix, and then toppings.  Went with full order of mix with the works.  The potato were a little better than the meat ones but having both worked well.  Liked the toppings, especially after add some more hot sauce.  Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I came here after a friend suggested it.  The employee was very friendly, knowledgable and answered all of our questions.  Food came out quickly, and was tasty.  I got a full order of the ground beef dumplings.  While I am not a fan of spicy food, I found that the \"WORKS\" were not overly spicy and all the flavors blended well together.  The dumplings themselves are small, but the full portion is very generous and I was very full at the end.  I plan on being a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Love the full time guy and gal that work there. The  food is great but they make going there even better. Make sure to get extra sour cream! The hot dumplings pair well with the cold creamy texture."}
{"text":"Pauls had a surprisingly chill atmosphere for a Saturday football night. We got a full order half potato half meat with the works. If I were to do it again I would just get the meat. Simply delicious!"}
{"text":"One of the best dumpling place (specially after bar), but just have two option- potato and Beef!!"}
{"text":"They do one thing.  And they do it really really well.  If you want pelmeni, look no further.  I used to live in madison, and I make it a point to come here every time I am back visiting. Makes for a killer lunch, or a filling dinner.  And may be the best late-night snack of all time.  And you can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"Unique and DELICIOUS. This was actually the very first place I tried when I moved to Madison, and I immediately fell in love. They serve russian potato dumplings, which I had no idea existed until I came here. They're pretty much small potato dumplings (go figure) with tons of flavorful toppings, and you can dip them in sour cream (which I would highly recommend doing!). 

It's fairly cheap and a half order of them is perfect for an afternoon snack. The place is somewhat small and kind of difficult to find, but it's quite a hidden gem right on the outskirts of State Street. I would definitely recommend getting a half order (or full order if you're hungry!) of the mix with the works. The mix is a mixture of beef and potato (you can choose to only have one or the other or both - I think the mix is by far the most enticing option), and the works is just all the delicious sauce they put on top, which includes cilantro and some spicy red sauce. I wouldn't worry if you're shy with spiciness, though - it's fairly mild. 

Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this place as it's a staple of downtown Madison and probably one of the most unique foods I've ever tried."}
{"text":"I'm hooked!  My first time there I got a full order mixed with the works.  The works wasn't for me and the potato wasn't doing it for me neither.  Now I get a full order of beef with extra cilantro and an extra cup of sour cream!  Damn, this place is delicious."}
{"text":"I feel so grinchy giving Paul's less than 5 stars like everyone else! I so wanted to be blown away by my first Paul's experience. Maybe, I over hyped my first experience in my mind before trying the first bite. I went with a half order of half and half with the works on top. Because, why not? Might as well try everything the first trip in. 
There was so much curry powder on my food that I accidentally inhaled a large amount of powder with my first dumpling bite, then started to cough and ended up getting curry powder all over the table and on my dining partner even. Thankfully, we are still friends after this incident! I love curry, but not that much curry. After the initial curry shock, I promptly mixed my dumplings and toppings before my second bite! The dumplings were not that flavorful on their own. The meat was a bit hard (and chewy) in quite a few of them too. 
There were 3 tables of us eating during this particular lunch hour. There was a female employee working behind the bar and she was repeatedly yelling at someone on the phone for about 20-25 minutes. It sounded as though it may have been a supplier of theirs. This situation was a bit uncomfortable for us.
The location is great for the college crowd and the late hours are perfect for the bar crowd. This probably would be a good stop after drinking on State Street."}
{"text":"4 blocks from my house, reasonably price, incredibly delicious...every time. I always order a full order of potato dumplings with the works and basically submerge the pel'meni in their awesome sweet chili sauce. The sour cream is the perfect side! Not to mention the employees are almost always extremely friendly. I recommend this little place to anyone. 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"THWUMP!!!

(That's the sound of me jumping on the Pelmeni bandwagon.)

OK, this is going to be a relatively short review for me since there are just two items on the menu.  You can get A) potato dumplings B) meat dumplings C) a combo of both.  

I went with the combo option.  While not gourmet dining, I thought the bite-sized dumplings were well made with fresh ingredients.  The dumpling skins were thick enough to hold in the filling, but not too thick to dominate the dish.  Both the meat and potato dumplings were well seasoned, unlike the bland Pierogies you find in the freezer section of the grocery store.  It was a relief not to see any heat lamps or steam trays.  After I ordered, person at the counter dropped the dumplings into a large vat of boiling water and they came out piping hot with a perfectly toothsome chew (the wrappers had no gumminess).

What elevates the dumplings from good to great are the sauces.  Don't spend any time pondering over which sauce to order - just go with The Works.  I never would have imagined that a combination of butter, sour cream, Sriracha, cilantro and curry powder would work so well with Russian dumplings, but it's a game changer.  Every bite was slightly difference and that variety is what hooked me.  With the all the various permutations (beef with Sriracha, potato with cilantro and curry, potato with butter, etc.), it's liking you are eating a dozen different dishes.

While spartan in appearance, the dining area was spotless when I visited on a Thursday evening.

$6.50 for a culinary world tour!?!  That's a winner in my book - I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Paul's is literally right across the street from my house. RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET! Yet it still took me a little while to find because it is tucked away between two larger businesses. If you, like me, aren't exactly sure where to find Paul's, just look for AJ Bomber's front entrance. The entrance to Paul's is just around the corner on the Gorham St. side.

Although they have plenty of seating, I'd say that Paul's is more of a take-out restaurant than a dine-in restaurant, as I was the only dine-in customer on a weeknight, even though I had gone at prime dinner hour. 

As per the suggestion of numerous Yelpers, I ordered a full order of mixed dumplings with the works. I was a little worried that the dumplings would be drowned in sour cream, because I am not a huge fan of that particular condiment, so I was relieved when I discovered that the sour cream was served on the side.

I chose not to use the sour cream at all, and I really don't think I missed out on much.   I was not all that impressed by the beef dumplings...in all honesty, they tasted a bit funky. I couldn't pinpoint the true issue, but I thought they tasted like xiao long baos gone wrong with an oddly soupy yet seemingly overcooked filling.  Meh. Never again. However, I can definitely see myself craving the potato dumplings once in a while, and I'm hoping to pick up some of their frozen dumplings so I can make them at home for cheaper. Still, $6.50 for a very filling - albeit a little unbalanced - meal is totally reasonable!"}
{"text":"Pel'meni should be the poster child dish for world peace and global cooperation. Apparently when you take meat- and/or cheese-filled little dumpling/tortellini/pierogi things from Russia, sprinkle them with curry powder, butter, hot sauce, cilantro, and add a side of sour cream, it feels like everyone really CAN work together and get along.

But seriously, I love the no-nonsense design of Paul's Pel'meni. I recommend getting the mix (half-potato, half-meat), because then you get a delightful combination of textures too. I was really impressed with how juicy and flavorful the (grass-fed) beef pel'meni were, since those are sometimes easy to overcook. $6.50 (for the full option) will get you a decent amount of food. The service was great."}
{"text":"love it, simple menu but satisfying.  Reminds me of an old family recipe from my grandma.  i wish they had shipping options or more locations.  The location is just not convenient to stop and get carryout due to traffic and parking.  I definitely will go out of my way for this dish next time in Madison."}
{"text":"Great food, but the last few times I've gone they got my order wrong. This is particularly impressive since it was just beef with the works."}
{"text":"Probably a 3.5 for me. Paul's is an interesting place for sure! Part dive bar ($3 shots of Jamo, Tully and Fireball always, drink specials every night), part Eastern European comfort food with a twist. 

We came to eat, not drink - but know that the back room is a simple bar space that doubles as a dining room. You place your order at the window. That part is easy because they got one thing - pelmeni. That thing comes in beef or potato varieties with a small at $4.50 and a large at $7. 

We ordered large sizes because we weren't sure and they are HUGE - definitely could have split a large or each had 1/2 size. You have your choice of butter, chili paste, curry and sour cream. We opted for just sour cream but found that the dumplings needed a bit of hot sauce.

The guys working are super nice, it's dirt cheap for sure - I found myself wishing for a bit more flavor in the actual dumpling though. I'd like to come back and try the fully loaded version though!"}
{"text":"You are magical. Never change. I would eat Pel'meni every day if I lived in Madison."}
{"text":"Quick and cheap for snacks, lunches, or dinners! 
I would recommend the mix which has potato and beef dumplings. The full order is $7 and the small is $5, I got the small because I wasn't hungry at the time. I topped it with butter, cilantro, and some sour cream. But you could try all the toppings if you would like.
I went with two Russian friends and they approved of these dumplings. We all agreed that it would be better if they have more options for their fillings. 
The space has a good vibe with an open bar also. The restrooms were not the nicest but they are alright."}
{"text":"Had a horrible stomach ache for about nine days this past summer.  Couldn't eat the whole time. 
What finally cured me? Russian Dumplings with the works!!! Truth! I was feeling 75% better after eating the mixed; beef and potato loaded with the works ....\"who'd a thought?\" ( I know I know Baaaad grammar)"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and decided to try out.  So glad I did.  Both the meat and potato dumplings were fabulous.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The sauces for the dumplings really make the meal. Priced reasonably.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Was Charles who walked me through the ordering process awesome? Yes.
Is the price right? Yes.
Was it speedy? Yes
Were my dumps delish? Yes.

But I left there wanting a little bit more. I mean for something with so much square footage, there isn't much variety. Meat or potato, that's all you get. And while I understand that's their thing... I wonder if they could fill that out a little bit more because tonight I had both meat and potato and don't feel like I need to rush back there. 

Now all that said, they were tasty, and my 4star rating is based on the fact that I really dug the entire experience... just a little something more than two options would make this place more of a go to for me. I will say that I love that in their move from State to Gorham they've made some solid food upgrades. They use an organic flour, Wisconsin potatoes and black earth meats, whereas Charlie told me before, everything was from Sysco. 

How about a salad? 
A soup? 
Anything with color?"}
{"text":"Such a beautiful, simple concept. The menu and restaurant itself are both delightfully small, but equally enjoyable. I've lived in Madison for three years and kept hearing about Paul's Pel'meni, but never walked the extra block off of State Street to try it out - my mistake, it is a WONDERFUL gem.

Food: The \"works\" (potato or beef stuffed miniature dumplings complete with a drizzle of Sriracha, a sprinkle of cilantro, a dusting of curry powder, and sour cream on the side) is a perfect combination of different flavors. The spices add a great kick, and the sour cream tones it down enough so that you don't shed a few tears. Perfect for a meal at any time of the day - late-night drunk snack, comfort food, or even just sitting down for a nice treat.

Atmosphere: This place is actually a hole in the wall. Lighting is dark and there is small seating along the window, but this is not a fancy place by any means. The food comes in a cardboard box for takeout, or a harder paper bowl for eating in. It's hardly aesthetically pleasing, but the food really makes up for it! Employees are always friendly and the crowd is extremely laid-back. Go for the food and casual atmosphere - those are the winning characteristics of this place! 

Tips: If you want some late-night dumplings and want to avoid the line, call ahead of time and order take out. The \"Hooked\" app in Madison also has weekly, if not daily, deals and discounts especially during the late afternoon if you need a fixing and are looking to save a little! The  prices are already extremely reasonable, but this just gives you another reason to stop by.

Overall, a wonderful, unique little place to stop by at any time! It's usually a hit or miss with people who visit but those who go once and like it are bound to return."}
{"text":"Paul's Pel'meni is awesome. The Russian dumplings -- I got the beef and potatoes combo -- with the sweet chili sauce with the Sriracha base, butter, curry powder, cilantro and sour cream explodes in the mouth with a whole bunch of flavors. Loved it."}
{"text":"On our drive to Green Bay we stopped in for some Pelmeni, my husbands family was from Russia, and this was such a fun mashup! We were shocked by how fresh everything was. Parking was a bit of a hassle for us, but we were new to town. Make sure to stop in if you're in town!"}
{"text":"Excellent!!!!!!  The dumplings were  melt in your delicious. I will defiantly go again and again. Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"i am Russian and i approve this place 100% . tastes just like home. did't get the works, just traditional sour cream and vinegar. Well deserved 5 stars."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison and ever! They do this dumpling stuff right because it's extremely addictive and I have not gotten tired of it yet! Sometimes if I'm hungry enough, I can eat two full orders in one sitting. This place is special. Only one thing on the menu but it's perfect. The flavors are just so perfect together. USE SOUR CREAM AND HOT SAUCE RELIGIOUSLY. That's what I do everytime and it pays off.. Maybe not for my weight but it's okay. It's an experience. This is a must-go in Madison. If you don't go you're missing out. Unless you hate sriarcha and sour cream :'("}
{"text":"This is yummy tastey food although I would like a little larger portions 

I go with Meat with the works!!

However not sure I like that there's a bar in the new location considering most people come here after bars to soak up the alcohol not drink more of it"}
{"text":"There isn't really much to add to what everyone else has said. Paul's Pelmeni is a great place to stop by for lunch or a big snack.

I recommend the combo with the works, a half order (~20 pelmeni) is usually good for 2 people for a snack or 1 for lunch. I like the meat dumplings a bit better than the potato ones. 

The place itself is pretty small, but they have a few tables and I've never seen it get that crowded inside. I've only ordered take-out, and it seems like that's what most people do as well.

The service is quick and friendly, which is great when you just want to order to go."}
{"text":"We wanted to try the pelmeni here based on the reviews and unfortunately left disappointed. We got a 1/2 order mixed with the works (yellow curry powder, chili sauce, cilantro, sour cream) for $5. The pelmeni themselves were ok but the same as you find in any Russian deli. You have a choice here, plain or the works, thats it. It's an interesting business model, basically selling one product with no variation, the opposite of the Subway model. Because of the apparent success of the business there must be a lot of people who like the works. More power to them but it didn't work for me. It was lacking in flavor and complexity. It's like something a college student would throw together after a night of drinking. Wait! that's the business model. ha ha

{"text":"Before I get into my review I need y'all to know that they have a full bar and are open to 3am. Whoa. 

Anyway, do yourself a favor and order a full order of the half-and-half with the works (dumplings with potato and beef filling tossed in butter, parsley and curry powder. Talk about umami flavors. 

FYI's: No waitstaff and you should do the right thing and bring your dirty dishes back to the front area. Limited street parking too."}
{"text":"Paul's is a consistently delicious and convenient place for late-night eats. On weekends it is full of drunk college kids (including myself, until my recent graduation), and still the employees succeed in dishing out deliciously flavored potato dumplings quickly enough to keep everyone satisfied. A Madison favorite!"}
{"text":"Interesting. Interesting that there's technically only two menu items, the ground beef version and the potato version. Interesting signage. It took us awhile to figure out that yes there really were only two menu items. Interesting people watching. Interesting food. Interesting food preparation. Literally 3 boiling pots of water. We liked our lunch. Have no idea how authentic it was because they were using siracha sauce but it was good none the less if you can get past the limited menu and the fact that curry literally means dried curry sprinkled on top of siracha sauce that's drizzled on these pasta type of things stuffed with either ground beef or potato."}
{"text":"The service was so fast and the dumplings were delicious! I even figured out how to tell the difference between the beef and potato (we got the mixed box) the beef are a little bit darker and more uneven on the surface and the potato are smooth and light. I left a happy dumpling :)"}
{"text":"I'm sorry. I just don't know what all the hype is about it. They're good. They're not bad. They fill you up. I am confused as to why this place is held as such a tasty, awesome place. I feel bad even as I am writing  this as it seems I am out of the norm compared to everyone else's review. I live 3 blocks away and ordered the works mixed for takeout. Maybe they weren't as hot when I got home? Idk the meat ones seemed so superior to the potato ones but even then, just average. I hope I got a weird batch and will give a another try in the future. It seems some people have had the same experience though but where maybe they are not all they are made out to be. Maybe I will have to try after a couple of beers! We will see"}
{"text":"They do two things, which are basically the same, so ordering is easy. It's good food, quick, and reasonably priced. The curry is interesting, and it goes well with the hot sauce. The potato takes the flavor better, but the mixed probably makes sense in terms of variety and nutrition. They boil the dumplings fresh to order. There's plenty of seating. The beverage selection is limited to a mini fridgebof cans next to the counter. There's parking around, but it's a busy area."}
{"text":"Finally, I had to see what all the hype was about. Came with a group of friends, plenty of seating for larger parties (at least at 8pm).

Menu is simple - potato, meat, or both dumplings. Sauces = all or some. Interesting take on eastern European cuisine - dumplings with the curry and sriracha. They were tasty, would definitely return. A side dish option would have been a nice addition to the menu. I understand that they're keeping it simple, but maybe some greens with a light citrus vinaigrette to balance out the richness and spice."}
{"text":"We tried all of the varieties and sauces. These Pel'meni are so delicious. The sauce combo has just a hint of spicy!"}
{"text":"So this is one of those places that you think couldn't possibly be as good as everyone says. OH... but it is.

The seating is minimal and weird. To be honest. However, the food makes up for it times a million.

You go in to this weird little kitchen area that looks odd and industrial and you order. There's only like, 3 things on the menu so it's pretty easy to choose. I recommend for the first visit do the 1/2 and 1/2 with the works. Then you can decide which one you like better. My meal with a drink was $10. I can accept that!

We went and sat down at a tiny table. It was lunch time and school is in session so it was a bit packed, but we were still able to find seating for the three of us. They brought us the food relatively quickly which is really nice when you're on a one-hour lunch break.

It was phenomenal! I mean, it looks and sounds so plain but for some reason it's like... the best dumplings you have ever had. Just wonderful. And it's super addicting. I actually crave it. It's a fun little experience and it's something different that you can't get anywhere else in the area.

GO HERE! Seriously. It is truly as good as everyone says. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"1 word, awesome! 

Super friendly staff and super quick and delicious dumplings! When I come back to madtown, ill remember I like their beef dumplings very much! !!

Great value for the amount of food as well! Amazing"}
{"text":"Oh, yes.

Little pillow plops of delicious. I love the combination of spices. I've been twice now to get more of the potato ones, and each time they were great.

The people behind the counter: friendly, on top of things, and great.

The only thing is maybe the ambiance? It feels a little open/sparse. But, whatev, because of the food!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how good these Russian dumplings are. The best drunk food a person in Madison could ask for. I'm serious. I have walked miles to this place because I knew."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places for late night food or a quick snack while on State st. It's cheap, quick, and the dumplings are basic, but fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I'm in love. Had the potato + beef with the works. One of the best comfort foods I've ever had. Be sure to drizzle them with vinegar."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Pel'meni? It is a great and affordable place to grab lunch. Or in my case, eat my weight in russian dumplings after bar close. 

The menu is very straightforward and whatever you do, get your order with the works. \"The works\" can be spicy to some, but you can get an extra side of sour cream to cut the heat. You get the choice of meat, potato or a mix of both. They use Black Earth meat so I don't even mess around with ordering potatoes. Meat 4eva. 

If you love their dumplings as much as I do, you can buy a full order of their frozen dumplings for $5. 

Next time you are stumbling out of the Plaza, hit up Pel'meni for a lovely change of pace."}
{"text":"Ohhh! Little pockets of pure joy and deliciousness! Just as good as it was at the original location, plus more space to sit! My friend preferred the beef to the potato. I have no idea how you could choose between perfection. Get the works!!"}
{"text":"Yum!!! A hole-in-the-wall that you could miss if you blink your eyes! You get this little box of food and wonder how it will be enough for dinner.... and then it is!! I prefer the beef, but the potato is delicious too."}
{"text":"Did not know what to expect upon deciding to come to Paul's. Well, this place made me a believer. Apparently this place has legendary status among the late night crowd in Madison, and I can see why. 

Stopped in on a Friday afternoon after having a few beers at State Street Brats. I actually was dead set on going to Dotty Dumpling's Dowry, which is bad ass, for a burger but my friend convinced me to come here. I order a half serving of the mixed, potato and beef, with \"the works\". After one bite, I was convinced. The chili sauce with sour cream put these little suckers over the top as far as flavor goes and I instantly regretted not getting a full order. Next time...hell, maybe two full orders. 

Service was polite. Diners order and receive their dishes at the same counter, as well as busing your own dishes, which to me is not a big deal. I especially liked that the cook preps your order in sight. 

Great find in Madison."}
{"text":"What's not to like about Russian/Eastern European meat or potato dumplings?  I think I will grab some for dinner the next time I'm downtown."}
{"text":"Had dinner here after catching a movie at Sundance. I followed the recommendations of my fellow Yelpers and got a full order of the beef with \"the works\". Once again Yelp was right! The dumplings were delicious and the seasonings were unique...not something I would think to put together but somehow they all work together perfectly. It's definitely not health food, more of a once in a while indulgence but totally worth the extra calories. And so inexpensive! We ate in, but most people were coming in for takeout. It's just a few tables in a smallish room with a counter where you order, so it's definitely a place you go to for the food and not the ambience. Several orders would make for great appetizers at a party. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The thing about Paul's is that you need to align your expectations with what they've got going on.  Don't expect an onslaught of choices.  The menu is super simple, but it's flipping great. I normally get take out while I'm working, but I hear they have a bar now.  This is my favorite comfort food."}
{"text":"Whenever I am sad, tired, happy, nervous, stressed out, cold, hot, hungry, full, or a combination of one or more of these feelings.... I want to eat pelmeni. It is quite literally the greatest comfort food I have ever eaten and never fails to satisfy me. I want it right now and I just had some a few days ago. I am likely going to venture out in the horrific arctic temperatures we are experiencing right now to get some, too. 

Now, that being said, I wish I could get a salad. Or just...something... other than rye bread (which I do not enjoy). The pelmeni really is amazing and is the reason people go there, but sometimes you want something other than carbs for dinner. And I often find myself wanting to get a 2nd order even though I know I shouldn't. 

Anyway, it will remain one of my most frequented spots regardless. Once they offer some more options I will happily upgrade my review to a glowing 5-star, because if it were JUST about the pelmeni, and not the overall experience, that is what they would get!"}
{"text":"Best drunk food in Madison. I am pretty sure I've only been here sober once, but when I've had a few to drink and I'm on State street? There is nothing better to help buffer your stomach so you're ready for an A-bar.
Seriously though, they do one thing and they do it really well. Those little dumplings are almost magical. If you didn't think Russians had a cuisine worth writing home about, this will change your mind."}
{"text":"It's fast, it's easy, it's inexpensive and it's delicious!  Forget the potatoes, full order of beef with the works!"}
{"text":"Paul's is a fantastic downtown dining option. You will crave them after your first experience. I've only had a mix of potato and beef with the works (curry powder, butter, Sriracha cut with rice wine vinegar, sour cream, and chives). They're fresh, filling, and delicious. Not a great option when you're in a hurry but the dumplings don't last long once they make it to your table."}
{"text":"This is a great and unique place!  They only have one thing on the menu (pelmini in either beef or potato or a mix), but they do it well!  The line is usually out the door during peak hours, but the wait is worth it!  Definitely a unique place that can't be beat!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Paul's Pelmeni!! The key is to ask for 75% beef and 25% potato with the works!"}
{"text":"I loved the simplicity of Paul's Pel'meni. I ordered the half, mixed, with the works. The \"works\" made for a delicious and unique flavor, and the half order was cheap at $4.50. If I return for dinner, I would probably order the full, but for lunch the half was just right. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Something interesting to try, but did not become a huge fan of it... It's a cheap lunch option though"}
{"text":"As much as this college town loves Pel'meni late night, I'd say it's just as great during the day. Get it with the works, and your day will be spiced up with a zesty mix of potato, Sriracha and basil flavors."}
{"text":"Perfect for drunk food, sober food, whenever food.

I got the half (20 dumplings, vs 35 in the full plate) mixed plate (some beef dumplings, some potato dumplings)  with \"the works\" toppings (curry powder, chili sauce, cilantro, sour cream on the side). I loved pierogis and dumplings in Poland - these are much smaller but the taste definitely compares! Add-on sodas are $1, while the bar that is a part of the place has a ton of beers and drink options as well. Bar specials run everyday as well as happy hour deals from Tuesday-Friday, 4-7pm. It's not a fancy restaurant by any means, but perfect for anyone looking for some tasty yet inexpensive food!"}
{"text":"I came here and I really loved the dumplings! The price is cheap which is a plus and the portions are huge. So you get a lot of your money. 

The place itself is nothing fancy! Although don't worry, it's not run down either! Can get pretty busy!

The only thing is that the menu is so small (two options--potato or beef--or a mix of the two) and so the taste gets pretty redundant. If I came back I wouldn't go for my full meal, rather I'd go to share a serving with a friend as an appetizer! 

FYI the rye bread is literally just a slice of rye bread from your standard loaf you'd find at a grocery store! I love rye bread but that was just a little bit disappointing! Also, make sure you get it with all the works on top (It's sriracha and some other things maybe a yellow curry of sorts?)--couldn't imagine the dumplings without it because that's where a lot of the flavor came from. 

I recommend checking this place out because it really is super unique and quite tasty!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, but wow did service blow. We waited almost an hour for our food. The cashier was blatantly rude to my friend and had a terrible attitude when helping out customers. Atrocious."}
{"text":"Potato Pelmeni with all works - that's my order all the time at this place ... Good place to crash in to fulfill your late night hunger."}
{"text":"Decent atmosphere, catering to a wide variety of occasions, whether you're on a date looking to impress on your knowledge of hidden hole in the walls or after a night out downtown. The food is really great, and it's an added bonus that the menu is really simple and straight forward. Service can vary depending on the time of the day, but it is definitely worth the wait. While waiting you can enjoy some surprisingly good deals on their Spotted Cows (a good treat for both Wisconsinites and non-Wisconsinites). If it is your first time here, I highly suggest getting the works to get a feel for what mixtures and combinations you like. It comes with both potato and meat dumplings, mixed with sour cream, chili sauce, curry powder and cilantro. After multiple visits their, I have found that I am a meat only, sour cream and chili on the side, and extra curry powder- kind of guy. You pick your own, and they'll make it for you!"}
{"text":"Best easy cheap food a girl-with-a-broken-leg-with-friends-go-pick-up-take-out could ask for. I always get their potato pel'meni with everything on it :)"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with dumplings - easy comfort food at college kid prices. The first and last thing I request to eat when visiting Madison."}
{"text":"Best place to grab a quick lunch, you can't go wrong with dumplings with the works."}
{"text":"Still confused with all the five star reviews.  The Pelmeni they served were not remotely authentic and had absolutely no flavor. Cheap eats yes. But to say they were good absolutely not. Tried both the meat and potato."}
{"text":"No better late night food for cold weather. Get the all beef the works. I don't even like sour cream, but nothing is more enjoyable than dipping those little dumplings just enough so if you have enough to last for the whole order."}
{"text":"It's funny how all the photos are the same because they only serve one thing. Or two things because the pel'meni come with either beef or potato filling. Also I think they serve rye bread on request which technically constitutes a third thing. That's not a complaint at all. I like when establishments find what they're good at and stick to it. And Paul's seems to get plenty of traffic and have plenty of fans.

Paul's was on my radar before I visited Madison but I dropped in because I was wandering down State St. and was looking for something to eat but wasn't starving. I also didn't have any cash. It's not like I couldn't have gotten some, but Paul's does take cards.

The atmosphere is a little \"down and dirty\" but in a good way. You come in and order from the abbreviated menu. But there's a whole bar in the back where you can sit. I wasn't drinking, but there's a couple of \"Alaskan\" brews along with several other drafts and taps. (I've seen pel'meni advertised as \"Alaskan\" dumplings, though it seems they're of Russian/Siberian origin.) There were soccer and basketball on the TV, seemed to be a student crowd on a weekday afternoon (but I know how that can change.)

I got a mix of the beef and potato pel'meni with \"the works.\" As some reviewers noted I also liked the beef ones best, but the potato ones added some variety. I saw the bottles of sriracha and what looked like vinegar. I should have been braver. But the chili sauce/butter/cilantro/curry combo they came with worked too. The pel'meni were good as a substantial snack and probably excel as drunk food too.

Glad to see something a little unusual has a following."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic place. I ordered half beef with the works. It came out quickly. I was very intrigued by the toppings. Butter, yellow curry, sweet chili, cilantro and sour cream seam like things that wouldn't go together very well. I was very wrong. It tasted amazing. The prices are very reasonable and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"These little savory packets of meat or potato are fantastic! The sauce (a unique combination of sriracha & rice vinegar) and a little cilantro creates a flavor combination that is both simple and extremely satisfying. They don't sell alcohol but these would be the perfect companion to some Russian vodka or bold craft beer."}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall place that I almost missed coming from the north. It's a smallish room with a counter and several stoves with huge pots. They have a limited menu, which is a good sign! I recommend getting the dumplings with \"the works\".  It's an odd combination of flavors but it works! Soooo good. Perfect late night snack. Service was friendly and quick. Overall: would return to try other items."}
{"text":"What the heck is a Russian dumpling. 
(my thoughts as I entered Paul's Pel'meni)

It is good. That's what.

These little dumplings o goodness make for one hearty and satisfying dish. As a meat and potatoes gal, these little pel'meni are excellently balanced between my need for some protein and my craving for some tummy-filling carbs. 

Plus, the flavor of these guys is so crazy good. Top the ground beef and potato with a drizzle of butter...vibrant yellow curry powder..sweet chili sauce..fresh chopped cilantro..and a dollop of sour cream..forget about it. 

I be back. And soon."}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough to be the first customer to eat at Paul's new location. After months of waiting to eat Paul's Pel'meni again, I am thrilled to see that Paul's seating has expanded its size and is able to accommodate larger crowds. The pel'menis themselves tasted familiar and comforting, and I'm pleased to say that the quality and price of their food will keep me coming back.

That said, I definitely miss their old look. Their new look steers away from its bright, creative, and artsy eating space into a more dark, divey, and rugged bar space. Maybe to accommodate a different crowd, but it just feels like it's lost its original charm.

Pro-tip: They also sell pel'menis FROZEN as well, with a full-order costing about $5 (without the fixins). Just add your own curry powder, cilantro, sour cream, and sriracha (their sauce is a housemade sweet-and-spicy sauce that they store in a sriracha bottle, but it's DEFINITELY not just sriracha)."}
{"text":"What can I say about Paul's? It's simple, delicious, and efficient. Wow this stuff is good and it's different than getting a fast food burger or pizza or taco. It's a great place to show off to guests for a cheap lunch and it's also a great post drinking spot. 

I love both the beef and dumpling potatoes. Get the mixture. Get everything on it. You won't regret it. And also get the full size, just do it. It'll be amazing."}
{"text":"Top 5 drunk food in Madison. Only two options, both of them great. Definitely get the works."}
{"text":"The staff were friendly and I the dumplings were on point. Highly recommend getting your order with the works!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try the famous dumplings! Having heard from some friends who love this place and read very good reviews on Yelp, I eventually bought this Russian dumpling. It was one bad day for me as I just had to pay a lot for my new macbook battery but the dumplings had really made my day! The dumpling is tiny but tasty. I usually have Chinese dumpling but this one tastes different. If you happen to be in the downtown, this place deserves your attention! The owner is easy to talk to. And the good news is that I live so close so I know I will be their regular :)"}
{"text":"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Calm down everyone! This place is FINE, especially if you've never had Pel'meni before. But it is the most basic Russian dish, the kind that comes suuuuper cheap in a frozen bag at any grocery store in Eastern Europe. It is basically the same thing as if someone gave you 5 stars for boiling them some Barilla pasta noodles. Now, homemade Pel'meni can be ridiculously delicious, but this stuff taste like the generic brand in the freezer aisle, which isn't bad, just lazy. I've had pel'meni probably hundreds and hundreds of times, and I'm telling y'all you're not encouraging this place to really serve up some awesome pel'meni by throwing it 5 stars willy nilly. For the quality of pel'meni they serve here, their prices are too high, AND they are super chintzy on the sour cream! Ok, so I'll admit, I'm a huge fan of sour cream! The sour cream in Russia is INCREDIBLE!"}
{"text":"This is the ultimate craving food. Complete with spicy flavors and sour cream to balance it out. 
Try the pelminis with a good drink to complement the spiciness 
I hope the owners put out a table vibration card or something so the poor cooks don't have to run out to serve in another room every few minutes"}
{"text":"I went there because there were such great reviews but I didn't know that a) the place was looked slightly dodgy b) not for a proper meal.. taste was not too bad but could definitely be better! The beef Pelmini is better than the potato one in my opinion! Would go again.. but just for snacks"}
{"text":"Well that was disappointing.  Couldn't wait to get back here when back in Madison.  They move to location to a dank spot that has ordering on one side, tables on the other.  No air conditioning and it's swamp-ass humid in the building.  They lost my order (they only make one thing) when I saw people who came in after me get their food, I went up and asked.  I go sit back down and it's brought to me...packed up to go.  That sucks, I didn't want my food in cardboard.  I got my money back and left.  That sucks....I was SO looking forward to those scrumptious bites."}
{"text":"Met a friend here before he made the long journey to Russia for a semester. Definitely the best and most authentic Russian goodbye dinner that I've had. A cozy, unique, and simple edition to the vast cultural cuisine that Madison has. Must try!"}
{"text":"Was five stars at previous location. 

The new dive bar location feels more suited for college students than families, which may be a conscious choice... especially given where they're located now. 

It's farther from work than it used to be, so went from going weekly to monthly and then kind of stopped.

Don't like the layout with the staff almost in a window at the front and then a totally separate dining area. Feels less personal/intimate as you don't see them making the food and talking to customers in the same way. 

Food is still decent, maybe half a star down,  but that could just be the degree to which eat with your eyes."}
{"text":"Nondescript. Almost missed it. Sent here by the man working the counter at the bookstore down the street. Which BTW was AWESOME too. They serve little Russian-style dumplings here with an incredible mix of meet and/or potato. They're cooked to order, so you'll wait a few minutes. Who cares? Tender and delicious, covered with butter, sriracha, seasonings, and get the sour cream too. They're a bit spicy but really really delicious. I'd go again in a hot second."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Late night lines can be pretty long, about 15 minutes seems typical. Dumplings are passable, when drunk, in my opinion. Music selection has been good though."}
{"text":"So good! If you like dumplings you must try this place. Potato or meat, you can't go wrong. Order the mixed and get the best of both worlds. Small place. Nice atmosphere. Nothing bad to report."}
{"text":"We had a full order of the potato dumplings and a full order of the mixed. They were amazing! They only take cash and if you like a little spice get them with the \"works\". I actually liked the potato dumplings better but the meat were great also. There is no variety on the menu whatsoever it is just meat or potato dumplings but they are soooooo good!

Carry out is quick and probably the way to go because it is not a huge place."}
