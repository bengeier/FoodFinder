{"text":"We were recommended to try Bagel Cafe by a friend and some people who love it on that side of town. The food was good, but the service was awful. Definitely not a place where I want to go back or take anyone. Tried to work with them again for an event and they didn't want to make it work. I tried to provide the feedback and it wasn't well received. If you want a good bagel or ruggalah, then go here, but not if you want great service."}
{"text":"As homemade as it gets.  We are Einstein regulars, and the bagels here seem fluffier on the inside, even when it's toasted.  And it tastes like fresh-made bread!  The blueberry cream cheese contains actual blueberry chunks.  

Service-wise, we got seated right away. A small ding for how long it took to get my final bill.  Five stars for food, 4 stars for service."}
{"text":"Cozy restaurant with a variety of options available for any type of eater, which includes a bakery and deli. The assortment of bagels, cakes / cookies, pastries and bread was almost overwhelming. It's definitely a place you have to go to a couple times so you can get a good idea of all they have to offer. 

It's kinda a hole in the wall. You can almost miss the location if you're not familiar with the area. 

The bagel chips are complimentary, and served when you are seated. Some pieces were really hard, but I guess that's the point. I ordered the Veggie Omelet with home fries and wheat toast. Great flavor, fresh tomatoes! 

I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed breakfast this morning at my favorite cafe. Service is fast and friendly even when the bus load of senior citizens from the local assisted living arrives. 
Wow news gets around fast when a place has delicious food and this cafe is always packed. On the bakery side again fast service and there is so much to choose from. My favorite will always be challah fresh in the morning I buy on my way out. 
Stop in and enjoy you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a craving for a bagel and lox this morning so I decided to stop in based on the yelp reviews. Ordered at the deli to go. Had a sliced and toasted everything bagel with lite scallion cream cheese and lox, plus a potato pancake and they threw in a pickle. When I got to the counter to pay? $15.17?! Wow, that's just crazy for what I got. Don't get me wrong, the bagel was delicious. But the price? Fuggetaboutit!"}
{"text":"Chocolate babka, chocolate rugelach, and black&white cookie...my favorites from this place!

Upon first walking in, you're greeted with display cases of bagels, cream cheeses, and the best part in my eyes, sweets! If you're in a rush and don't want to dine-in, someone will take your order around that area and they'll bring it over to the cash register. Otherwise, if you'd like to sit in, to your left will be the dining area. 

What I've ordered:
-Lox and bagel platter: was told the sandwich and the platter were the same price. You have your choice of bagel and cream cheese; otherwise, you'll get plain cream cheese. Tried the everything bagel and onion bagel. Get the everything bagel.
-Matzo ball soup: I've never had it before but it definitely tastes comforting and homemade. You get chicken shreds, noodles, veggies, and a matzah ball. It also comes with your choice of bagel. Got the onion with this order. 
-Rainbow cookie: very sweet and moist. Not a big fan of rainbow cookies but you definitely can taste the almond flavor and raspberry filling.
-BABKA! Get it. They have 3 flavors and they're huge. Came home cradling it like it was a baby.  I got the chocolate. I'd describe it as a chocolate cinnamon roll made into a loaf with a doughy center and chocolate covering. Perfect with coffee. Waitress told us she makes them into french toast. Something I'm going to have to try next time because it was annihilated in 2 days. Not sure how often they make it or how popular this item is but I got the last one on display at 730a and they open at 630a.
-Chocolate rugelach: if you like chocolate, get it. They're like mini chocolate strudels/crossaints. Also available in sugar free chocolate and other flavors like raspberry and apple cinnamon.
-Black&white cookie: 2 sizes, small and large. Just go for the large. 

Overall, I like this place. Reminds me of a NY bagel cafe. Price is reasonable and service is friendly and welcoming. I plan to come back to try the rest of their sweets and the other flavors of babka. Needless to say, I enjoy this place and recommend it to those looking for a simple breakfast and some desserts."}
{"text":"This place sucks.  How many times does one person have to call in a take out order for me to arrive and they forget to put the order in, then they want to give you a free dessert b/c they screwed up.  I don't want a free dessert, I just want my order put in!!!  Get some people with brains that work there."}
{"text":"What a great place to go !!!

This was my first time and I must say I was well pleased !!!

Great food, great service, great everything except the parking !!!

Even with that considered still a fine place to eat !!!

Try it !!!

You won't won't regret it !!!"}
{"text":"THE best black and white cookies I've ever been able to find. I'm always looking for something as yummy as the one at the bagel cafe every time we travel and I have yet to find one that's as good. All of their baked goods are delish. Matzo ball soup is one of the best as well"}
{"text":"Comfortable casual atmosphere.  A good place to meet friends friends for a . Deli experience . Nice size portions and tasty food."}
{"text":"Most of this review can be attributed to the pasteries.  The cheesecake is to die for!  As for the pastrami, I would say its just average.  Everytime I have ordered a bagel, it has been rock hard.  Coffee is nice and strong.  What really brings down the rating is the service.  The waiters just dont seem to care.  We have been seated at tables much too small for our party several times.  Any special orders or add ons never come with the meal, we always have to remind the server.  Avoid Sundays unless you want to wait for at least an hour."}
{"text":"Apparently I'm a glutton for punishment. All your obvious problems aside you do have the best bagels in Vegas. Of course that is only true if you get the bagels you ordered. 
Stopped in for a dozen after lunch. Yes I understand it's Sunday but coming from NY I still can't believe that if a place runs out of certain flavors they don't make more. Surprisingly you had pumpernickel. Too bad you gave me a shortchanged dozen everything bagels (I ordered 2). Not surprised. I should know by now that the guys behind the counter can't count. Even if you tell them how many of each bagel. Always short 1 or 3. 
So now I really & truly am done with you. No more messed up orders. No more low quality food. No more e-coli from your undercooked frozen burger patties. No more crappy service. No more surly attitudes from counter guys. No more pathetic excuses for a manager. 
I guess I'll have bagels & pastrami again next visit to NY."}
{"text":"Normally this place rocks. The service has become subpar.  They are understaffed and don't really care that others get served before you even when they arrive way after you.  They make excuses, but offer no apologies. Very sad this place has gone so down hill."}
{"text":"Best. Jewish. Deli. Ever. I will not get rugalah anywhere else. Every time I'm in town I make a point to stop here. Everything I've tried is so fresh. Would recommend the corned beef and hash with eggs (breakfast), shrimp salad sandwich, and bagel with the nova spread. The owner, Sarvas, really knows how to build that customer relationship. Will always come here as long as this place exists!"}
{"text":"This is the closest your going to get to an authentic NY Bagel shop.  I really enjoy their food."}
{"text":"They have the worst customer service.....our waitress was terrible and the manager on duty was even worse....no customer service skills at all....they didn't have what we came for....no tip for you today sucky waitress...you just lost customers that have eaten there since you opened"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, bagels and all types of sweets and pastries - i had their pastrami sandwich and fell in love - generous portions of quality meat and good bread - what else can you ask for! 

I've had many of their sweets, they were all delicious. A bit pricey, but I don't mind it considering the quality. I usually visit about 2-3 times a month."}
{"text":"Pastrami not as good as Carnegie on The Strip, but their desserts, knishes and matzo ball soup are to die for! Best items:
Greatest hamantaschen in town with a nice chewy cookie with a lemony zest! Rugelach are excellent as well. Try the raspberry with cream cheese or the chocolate. Black and white's are awesome. Of course there's the bagels. These are some of the best homemade knishes in town with golden crusts and fluffy, garlicky fillings that scream eat me! 
Babka is good as well. The challah is good quality, but not quite as good as Weiss Deli in Henderson. Also, I prefer the smoked whitefish of Weiss and Levy's to their chunkier variety. The celery and other hunks detract from the smooth smokiness that I crave. 
The stuffed cabbage is good, but not as good as Carnegie on The Strip. The brisket dinner I had once was decent, but I've had much better."}
{"text":"I've been a customer for many years. Today, I got $40 worth of take out food. Here is my question, Bagel Cafe: If you don't give me a detailed receipt after I pay, how in the world am I supposed to know what my items cost? I don't appreciate this omission!! Did I get ripped today? I guess I'll never know..."}
{"text":"Bagel Cafe is a solid 5 stars! We always visit whenever we are in town, worth the drive. Great breakfast and I always leave with a black and white cookie."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place several times. Despite my two star rating, the food is relatively good. My last experience, however, left me with a bad taste in my mouth (pardon the pun). First, the portion sizes are obscene. I ordered a Cobb Salad and it was piled high with a half-pound of bacon, a half-pound of turkey, and a half-pound of ham. I'm not joking when I say I was absolutely disgusted by the sight of it. It was portioned for someone who is morbidly obese and rides around in a Hover-round waiting for bypass surgery or in line waiting to have a limb amputated because of sever Diabetes. Seriously...it's gross...and a total waste of food. Who wants 8-10 strips of bacon on a salad? It reminded me of why I don't like Deli's like this where they serve cumbersome sandwiches that are meant for three people. 

My second complaint about this place is a sign that I noticed on the door. It read, \"This is a place of peace...no weapons please\".  Are the owners brain-dead and tone-deaf to the environment we find ourselves living in now? Do they believe that a criminal or gawd-forbid, a terrorist is going to read that sign and say to themselves, \"gee, they don't allow weapons in here, maybe I should go to a Denny's.\"? I legally carry because I have a constitutional right to protect my family and myself. Law abiding citizens with CCW and law enforcement officers are NOT the problem. Why would you put a sign in the window telling criminals that they won't find any resistance inside? 

Those two reasons alone make another visit unlikely. But, if I'm dragged back by friends or family who want to eat there...rest assured, I'll still be carrying...despite their idiotic \"kumbaya\" sign."}
{"text":"OK... new LV resident and wondered if they had any authentic deli's in town. Hit pay dirt on this one. Been there twice and extremely pleased both times (bfast and lunch). Breakfast was great with choice of bagel and I had the egg white spinach and feta omelet which was lite and chock full of fresh spinach. Lunch for our part of 3 pleased all. Wondered if I could try the liverwurst and the waitress gladly came back with a slice to try and the sandwich was great. I tried my lunchmate's pastrami and it was to die for. Relaxed and friendly atmosphere with a deli and dessert counter for take out which I did. The brisket was tender and juicy and the B&W cookie... the best since I got one in NYC."}
{"text":"Why did I wait soooo long to go here?! Seems like I've passed by The Bagel Cafe for years! Finally made it in for breakfast and ended up taking lunch to-go and coming back the next day. We came early on a Saturday and thank goodness because it got really busy but the time we left (9:30ish).  It's a restaurant / bakery / NY style deli - wow!

Here's the rundown on what we've tried so far:
  -- Biscuits & sausage gravy with eggs and sausage patties  
I'm a country gravy girl and this was pretty good!
  -- Corned beef hash 
Best we've had in town!  My Honey actually ordered this and I ended up eating half his and giving up half my biscuit :)
 -- Egg salad and BLT sandwiches - both good, hard to mess up a BLT.
 -- Bagel with veggie cream cheese. They make their spreads in-house and they put it on generously! I'll get it on the side next time because the bagel itself is delish.
 -- Rougalades (sp?) all yum

Taking my son this weekend and can't wait to try the potato pancakes and pecan roll.  Would be 5 stars if the service was better, but hey it's a popular place so it get pretty busy and there is a wait - worth it to me though!"}
{"text":"Another place I must visit when I'm out in Vegas. Of course, I've only been here 3 times and each time I get the same thing. Lump Crab Eggs Benedict. Heaven in my mouth! I don't come here for the coffee, which is drinkable, but not the best. I come here for this heavenly lump crab dish.... and the deli/bakery items. My mom had me try the potato cakes last time we were there and..... excuse me. Had to take a breather. Just thinking about those delicious, wonderful potato concoctions with the apple sauce.... Yummmmmmmmm.

The cafe service has been great for me each time. The last time I was there was on a Sunday morning and they were jam packed!!! The waitress was great and attentive, even though the place was packed. On busy days, I understand poaching eggs can be a little difficult because there's a lot more to pay attention to, so when I pointed out that my eggs had been overcooked, without hesitation, she comped me for one of my favorite things in the bakery. (I didn't want them remade.... they were still edible)

The bakery staff is why this place didn't receive a 5 star rating from me. Since I'm still new to the place, I didn't know that you had to stand in line at the deli to get service at the bakery. No one spoke up and when I tried to get the attention of one of the guys, I was blown off. When I finally received service, I placed my order and then asked for something from the deli. He treated my request as a big inconvenience. Needless to say, if it's a busy day, I'll just eat at the cafe and leave my bakery/deli order for another, less busy time.

Their food is great. Their bakery and deli items are delicious. I would recommend this place to everyone and anyone, but I would tell them to be patient and try to go when it's not so busy."}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite breakfast place in Las Vegas. I have been going here for years and years. I'm actually upset with myself for not reviewing this place the moment I opened my yelp account.

Its one of the only New York style Jewish delis in Vegas. Their baked goods are all excellent. There is nothing that makes me happier then having someone bring me their bagels and schmear. Well except for getting a plate of Lox with the bagel. 

The only problem is this place is popular and is usually busy, especially so during peak hours on the weekends. Usually I just go before work by myself and eat at the counter so the wait is not bad but I see a lot of people waiting.   

For lunch they have awesome deli sandwiches. I go here anytime I need to get my pastrami and cheesecake fix on!"}
{"text":"Great food and large servings. All items are fresh and cooked just the way you want. There is a huge variety of items on the menu and all are very good. The bakery is the best around and many items are double in size. The staff is professional and do a good job meeting yours requests."}
{"text":"I guess everyone has a bad day.  I come here when I'm craving a good bagel.  Didn't get it today.  Unusual..."}
{"text":"This place is always packed and well worth the wait! I usually do a Saturday brunch here.i love all of their delicious bagels and their pastries are to die for. I love their carrot cake and they are very generous with the sizes."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast and lunch.  Service is always quick.   The pastrami is excellent, as are the bagels.  They are always fresh and taste like a traditional New York Bagel.  The bakery in the front of the restaurant also has great cookies and pastries.  They make an excellent Black and White cookie, in 2 sizes no less!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, and the atmosphere is great. It was comfortable and quiet. The flavor like no other and the coffee an A+. My first time there I was a bit confused with the dynamics of how to order to go, so I decided to stay and have breakfast there. 
Great experience. Totally worth the calories.

I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service in the restaurant and at the deli counter. Honest recommendations and every dessert so far is on point (cheesecake, carrot cake both excellent). Generous portions and easy pick up orders."}
{"text":"The food here is great. The only reason I gave this review 2 Stars today is because I dined in and at the end I wanted to order some desserts to go but was told that I had to order from the deli. It feels completely asinine that I would have to go stand in line to order more food while I'm already sitting at a table and eating. This policy is confusing and doesn't make any sense to me."}
{"text":"We arrived 20 minutes before their advertised closing.  Manager offered  for us to place a go order but we couldn't dine in.  This was after we called to confirm what time their last seating was which was quarter to.  

In  a city with so many restaurants,  I will go  somewhere with staff that wants your business  instead of turning it away 20 minutes before their advertised closing."}
{"text":"Great place that I dine at regularly! The food is always great, service is excellent, and te price is more than reasonable. I always take my friends here when they visit and it's always a match made in heaven! The menu is pretty extensive, so lots to choose from for anyone! 

My faves:
French toast
Bacon, scrambled eggs, American cheese sandwich on a plain bagel
Corned beef sandwich
Pancakes
And all the freshly made desserts!

The portions sizes are very generous as well, especially for the price!"}
{"text":"Expect extreme attitude!! I ordered the corned beef and there is a generous amount of meat,but it is very fatty.. I also ordered the black and white cookie and i thought it was horrible..the cookie part was more like cake. When checking out the girl was extremely rude..long story short, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The best bagels in town!   Super busy on weekend mornings so I get my food to go.  I usually get the everything bagel with nova lox, it has the perfect blend of smoked salmon and cream cheese. And I also order the cinnamon raisin bagel with the cinnamon raisin spread so good.  And beware of  the pastry display case it will call your name.  Make sure to get a slice of strawberry cheese cake,  It is so velvety good and a good size portion for dessert for after lunch,  after dinner, and breakfast the next day."}
{"text":"Awesome for breakfast and lunches.  Reminds me a bit of delis back East, even the two guys behind the counter were from right outside of my hometown in southern N.J.  I haven't ventured into the 'strami yet but the Eggs Benedict and Matzo Ball soup pass with flying colors.  I've gotten the lobster salad  and some smoked whitefish to go and it was definitely a treat.  It's not the cheapest \"cafe\", but it's definitely worth it.  Pretty good cup'o'joe as well."}
{"text":"The cashiers at this restaurant are incompetent. Every time I order from here my order isn't fully ready, they take people before me. It's a mess there's no order in this place it's very frustrating."}
{"text":"Food is good but for some reason they can't get a take out order correct. This is the second time I've ordered pancakes to go, get home and there is no syrup or butter in the bag. No straw for my drink. It's so frustrating and disappointing."}
{"text":"We rented a house in Summerlin for a month and my husband researched a good deli. He found a total WINNER! We went to The Bagel Café atleast 2x a week. They have an awesome bagels and deli selection with fresh sturgeon, lox and turkey! We also enjoyed lunch there! We will miss this place when we go home!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd best place to go for breakfast. The restaurant is large and never had a long wait time to be seated. The service is good and their food is consistently good. I really like their homestyle potatoes, they are so flavorful. I haven't yet gone here for lunch but their menus shows a good selection of sandwiches. 

They have a bakery/deli side that is hard to resist wanting to buy one of everything they have and especially their bagels, Yum, yum."}
{"text":"The atmosphere mirrors an East Coast Jewish Deli.  However, UNLIKE Jewish Delis,
This establishment doe Moreovs NOT cook their OWN Brisket.  It is a pre cooked Deli Brisket by a well known lunch meat counter manufacturer.

However, the prices that this establishment charges reflects one of an authentic JEWISH deli for this region.

That said, I will NO longer frequent this establishment. Moreover, I have notified my colleagues, friends, family members NOT to visit this establishment  as well.

Pre COOKED KAWALSKI Deli products does NOT make a VALID Jewish Deli!!

SHAME ON YOU BAGEL CAFE!!"}
{"text":"This place has some great sandwiches. The portions are huge!! Usually get the turkey and it's more than enough. Good for sharing too. The food never disappoints."}
{"text":"Wanted to try somewhere new for breakfast. After reading reviews we decided to give it a go. Walking in you can smell all the different kinds of food. It smelt wonderful. It was seat yourself, which was easy. It was a little crowed and loud like a cafeteria. We waited for like 10 minutes for someone to finally acknowledge us to take our drink order and since we had time to look over the menu we where able to order our food. It seemed like it took awhile for us to get our food. 

We ordered the French toast with a side of sausage links. Two eggs with bacon/sliced tomato with everything bagel. The people you sat down long after us order two sandwiches and they got their food quicker than us. The food was great. Eggs were perfect and not just put together real fast. French toast had four huge pieces. I order the everything bagel, it would have been good if they didn't burn the top. The food was great. 

The services was just horrible. And not even worth it. When we finished we waited for our server to come with the check and we waited around 15 minutes for her to come. We never got any refills or even check on to make sure things were good. It was hard to even get someone's attention. Three stars for service. Otherwise would have given five. Might go back, but order carry out instead."}
{"text":"It was the first time for my husband and I - and I have been craving for some really good bagels for a few weeks - and yes, the bagels are YUMMY!  I ordered a bagel sandwich - since they were so busy (it was around 11am) they kind of messed it up, but they were extremely friendly about it, so no hard feelings.  I'm from the east coast, and it sure does remind me of the bagels from home!  I definite must try and they don't skimp on the portions!"}
{"text":"Service is really good and food is ridiculously large and quite tasty. It's sort of a Cheers of breakfast places. The same servers every time and they start to recognize people. There's sometimes a wait, which can seem to stretch longer than it needs to. Good grub."}
{"text":"Love this place! it's close to home, the bakery section has huge servings and always delicious and the dining area is usually crowded with fellow diners. The lox and bagel is A+, best I've had in town so far. This place isn't cheap so make sure you have some cash to spare"}
{"text":"Best deli in Las Vegas!  Great bagels and soup. My personal favorite. You cannot go wrong here. Tends to get crowded on weekends at brunch time but always worth the wait."}
{"text":"Hmm ok..

Pros: 
your craving bagels & you can buy them here.
You seat yourself
You can get a chocolate egg cream
Chicken soup has lottsa chicken

Cons: 
service
Service
Service?
Cashier : zero personality- no .. Hi! No.. How was everything.. Just zombie taking & processing payments .. No \"thank you\"- & god forbid the smiley mgr guy coaches her to offer some bakery items before departing (they may make some extra revenue on all of those beautiful baked goods yearning to be munched - god forbid)! I'm like f this ill hit trader joes for some cookies instead..  
& rewind: btw the \"waitress\" dropped the check w/out offering anything else- did I want a 3-4$ chocolate egg cream after my $35 bagel soup onion ring lunch- hell ya but she dropped the check like ..bounce -so we did"}
{"text":"Real new York bagels. Matzoh ball soup from heaven. Big meat sandwiches. Slow roasted meats. Full on baked goods in pastry cases.  Deli counter. The sweetest waitresses. I wish it were closer to my home:("}
{"text":"Took my little one to eat breakfast here after long day at pumpkin patch and was not satisfied. Potato's are hard and over medium egg completely over cooked ."}

{"text":"Great sandwiches!!!  I had the hot postrami...  I think That's how you spell it.. lol anyway I also had the mostov ball soup...  Thats good too!! The atmosphere is laid back and cozy...  It's a great place to have comfort food and relax...  I recommended this hideaway place to anybody that just want to relax!!! Great food great place!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here because my parents have always enjoyed coming here. I was slightly disappointed with the service. We had been sitting there with drinks we received from the \"beverage server\" for a while and watched 2 other tables get sat, served their drinks, AND have their orders taken.
Meanwhile the server NEVER came to our table. He didn't even acknowledge us. Finally we had to ask for a new server.

Once we actually had a server that paid attention to our table, everything was great. The food was delicious.
It was a bit weird how 2 meals were served 5 mins before the rest of the table, however as previously mentioned, the food was delicious.

After we finished we went up to the deli/bakery.
Wow, what a mad house; couldn't tell where the line to order was and who was waiting to be sat.
This place would benefit greatly from expanding.
The deli/bakery had TONS of treats to choose from. And pretty good prices for their baked goods.

I'll be back for the food, just hope that the service is better."}
{"text":"So the wife and I eat here at least every other week. She likes the omelettes and I usually get the nova and bagel. She thinks the omelettes are light and fluffy and this is the only place I've found with decent lox and bagels. This last experience might just have changed our opinion though. I ordered the corned beef sandwich, which in the past has been good, and she got her usual. Her omelette came out burnt and tough, and my corned beef was entirely inedible, it was dry, cold and flavorless. I never knew  corned beef could be that bad. The waiter made himself scarce after dropping the food. And the cashier made a joke when she asked me how everything was and I replied that it was horrible. When I said no i was serious that it was horrible, she said \"ok, sorry.\" Completely uninterested in what was wrong or how they could improve it.

While I've always thought this was the best deli food in town, that really has been mostly due to a lack of good competition. With the lack of concern I saw with customer satisfaction, though I would have to say it wouldn't take much competition to get me to go somewhere new."}
{"text":"Bagel Cafe is our favorite breakfast place in Vegas! It's just like being at a Jewish Deli in NYC. Great food, great people, great service! Kim is our favorite Waitress!"}
{"text":"If you like mediocre food (on a good day), poor service, and rude workers, this place is for you."}
{"text":"The best ever.  Missing New York, go to Bagel Cafe. Food and service is the best.  We love it.  Fresh backed good to in-house roasted brisket. Yummy the best.  I'm lucky, I live here. I can go all the time."}
{"text":"Love the food......hate the coffee.   Their breakfasts are the best in LV, tasty, cooked to order, more than filling, but cannot deal with the weak and tasteless coffee.   Each time I give it  the old college try but have to face reality and now just order tea.   Please, please add some 
more beans!"}
{"text":"For my money and taste buds, this is the best Jewish deli in town, or at least on the west side.  It's located in an office complex off Rainbow and Summerlin pkwy, with plenty of parking.  They make all their own bread and bagels in house, the brisket is delicious, and their deserts are ridiculous!  I mean, their cookies can be bigger than your head!  Who doesn't like that?!

I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal here, at worst, a mediocre one every now and then.  But honestly, they carry all the traditional NY deli that you just hope to find somewhere else.  They also do a good matzah ball soup, knishes, and have good lox, which is key.  My grandfather was a fan because they had a bunch of the Dr. Brown sodas.  Personally, when I want some good soul food, this is where I go."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always have. 

It's the best Jewish deli I've had west of the Eastern Time Zone (although LA has a few good spots). 

Reading some of the negative reviews, I have to laugh. Of course the turkey wrap was only so-so, you dolt, you don't order a hamburger at a sushi place and expect it to be good, do you? And the food has TOO MUCH MEAT? Please, here is $20, go screw yourself. Please. 

Stick to the Jewish food--corned beef, matzo ball soup, hard salami, bagels etc etc--and you'll remain impressed. 

They always have some funky specials and I've tried them now and again, but the regular menu has so many things I like that I don't mess around too much. 

I try every chance I get to stop at this place. I live nowhere near it but anytime I'm even close to nearby, I'm stopping in for a meal or carry out. 

The pasties are great and the variety is always appreciated. 

Tip for you goyim--order a side of old and new dill pickles. They are both great."}
{"text":"Go somewhere else. The bagel cafe doesn't stand by their staffs mistakes and they don't stand behind their old shirty food pushed out the door to go.


What happened to this place? Repeated our order a multitude of times to the inept staff behind the deli counter. Over and over again they kept getting it wrong and we had to keep repeating ourselves.

After a forty minute wait and a thirty minute drive home. Surprise!!! The order is all wrong and missing items. 

Spoke to Pablo. Joke. \"It's human error\" 

Old roast beef. Old salmon dripping with nasty juice."}
{"text":"great pastry selection in an area of town that it's hard to find a quality bakery thats not in  a grocery store 

I had the flu this past month and survived off of a week straight of their Matzo Ball soup.  Yes, it is THAT good.  

Nice people who serve and work here and they do take out."}
{"text":"Omg what can I say the staff owner manger and food was perfect Bagels are the best in town very clean and. The owner is there watching his baby I get a great family feeling there"}
{"text":"Love this place - been there more times than I can count. Friendly staff, fantastic bagels/muffins. Served like an east coast deli but find that I can usually split a 3 egg combo with someone else. It can get packed the later in the morning you go but absolutely worth the short wait."}
{"text":"Good spot for breakfast, lunch or early dinner (Tues-Friday open 6:30 am til 8 pm. Other days they close at 5 pm). Large dining area and smaller dining room in the back. Great deli items and classic favorites - something for everyone. I highly recommend The Bagel Cafe when you're craving a deli experience."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. Their pastrami and brisket are top notch. The bakery is freaking awesome too. 
Don't expect a quick lunch, the place gets busy. But that's a good sign in my book. 
There is a lot of overrated deli in town. Bagel cafe is the real deal."}
{"text":"Bagles bagles bagles, oh how I've searched for you~ driving down Buffalo we saw the sign for a New York deli and bagle shop so we had to stop. We were speachless....or rather, the things coming out of our mouths were not words anymore, just hushed squealing. It was BEAUTIFUL. Fresh baked goods, homemade CREAM CHEESE!!! , to-go items, cold cuts, pastries, you name it- the display itself is worth the trip (boop failed her arms like a 5-year old in a candy shop for a solid 5 minutes). Once we regained our composure we seated ourself. 11 am on a Thursday morning, it was already packed. 

Busboys were quick to give us water and silverware, then someone brought us over their complementary cream cheese of the month with some bagle chips (the pesto flavor is great). After a good look through their newspaper menu's, we ordered. The chicken salad was perfect and came with a side of potato salad (of which boop commented about the potato salad \"this tastes just like my mom's I'm going to cry\" and I swear she really did have tears in her eyes) the portions were huge. Coffee was on point, delicious- not burnt and not too strong. 

The bagles here are the  R E A L   D E A L !

Couldn't have asked for a better breakfast, definitely going to make this one of our morning spots.  Next goal: come for dessert !!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out, but I was sadly disappointed. I had the pastrami sandwich it was very plain. Only meat and the bread. If I ever go there again I will try something different. My bf had the French toast and he said it was okay nothing blew us out of the water."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today and I must say, I am a fan. The bagels weren't the best I've ever had, but the cream cheese was spot on. I love the variety of flavors of they offer. I felt like I was back in NYC. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Where you can find me most sundays. But lately the service is getting SUPPPEERRR SLOOOWWW. Plus the price has gotten insane, last weekend it cost $42.00 for my bf & myself, crazy for breakfast. The french toast is extremely good and their bagels are fresh."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a legit NY style bagel, this is it. Solid variety, great deli and bakery case. Felt like I was in a good 'ol family run deli. We've tried other bagel places nearby and they're a bit of a let down. Too doughy, missing that firm, almost crispness on the outside. Hmmm. Getting hungry writing this. Might have to head there now. Salt bagel for the win!"}
{"text":"Today just got the low carb cheesecake ,excellant very creamy and not to heavy, could not tell lo carb almost feel guilty eating this, like I said in my earlier post bakery outstanding ."}
{"text":"When I say over easy, they cook them exactly that way. For my egg lovers you know what I mean, enough said."}
{"text":"The bagels were pretty good. The yogurt parfait is probably the best I've ever had. Definitely worth driving if you're staying at the strip and don't want marginal overpriced food."}
{"text":"Love bagels and they have the best in town. Great deli and really yummy nova cream cheese. Wait staff is friendly. Go early because they get busy for breakfast. Looking forward to trying lunch next time."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night.  The Bagel Cafe is very clean and inviting.  The server was very good and accommodating.  I ordered the steak dinner with baked potato.  The dinner also came with a side salad, roasted vegetables and later coffee and dessert.  The steak was just as I ordered it, the side salad was a good size and excellent, not just lettuce, the best side salad I have had anywhere.  Baked potato was perfectly done, but my favorite part was the roasted vegetables of asparagus, Brussels sprouts, carrots and green beans.  I was so happy the vegetables were not the usual zucchini with other overcooked generic vegetables.  This is my new favorite place.  Delish!"}
{"text":"All I wanted was a grilled cheese sandwich with tomato and bacon in sourdough bread. The first time the waitress brought out the sandwich it was missing the tomatoes and bacon and the cheese wasn't melted. The second time the sandwich wane out the raw tomatoes and bacon we stuck in between the bread and cheese I mean the cheese wasn't melted. It looked like a cheese sandwich you give your 6 year old. The cheese wasn't even melted and the tomatoes were still raw. I flagged the waitress down and returned my sandwich. The regirse time the Sandwich calme out everything was looking good but it wasn't on sourdough it was plain white bread.  At this point I decided to just eat my food as the rest of my party was already finished eating. I mentioned it to the waitress and not one else did she apologize instead she got an attitude with me. When she brought the check she told me with an attitude that they had taken my sandwich of since I wants happy with it. I don't know what happened today but customer service was not a priority at the bagel cafe today. It would also be very helpful if the kitchen learns what a grilled cheese sandwich is."}
{"text":"The food was good and our waitress fairly attentive and nice. I got the matzo ball soup and half a pastrami sandwich. I'd never had that kind of soup before but thought it was quite tasty, and had large chunks of yummy chicken in it. I was thinking that I would definitely come back here. That is until we went to pay. There were seven of us on one check so while the first couple of people started to pay my friend and I went to check out the bakery items. They looked amazing by the way. We noticed that nearly everyone in our group had paid so we came to the register to pay also. That's when I noticed the man paying at the register next to us was complaining to the blonde woman working that we had cut in front of him. The woman loudly stated to him but obviously so we could hear, \"some people need to pay more attention to the people around them.\" Clearly they were talking about us so I said, \"excuse me we were all on the same check, we are with the same people who were just paying.\" The blonde woman working rolled her eyes at me and refused to acknowledge me. Then the woman who was working our register tried to tell me that the other members of my group didn't pay. I left her with my credit card and went to get them. They had in fact paid she was holding a large sum of cash in her hand and she said when I got back \"Oh this was for their meals?\" and acted insulted. Lady we weren't tipping over $100 on the $100  check!! To add insult to this experience as I tried to finally leave a woman coming in the door started walking right into me. I stopped to avoid a collision and she shoved me and said \"excuse you\" to get past me. Obviously I can't blame the restaurant for that last incident but if that's the kind of clientele you attract I don't want to be a part of that group. The food was not good enough to make up for all the rudeness at the end."}
{"text":"Love the food but the attitude of the owners is terrible.   Its like they  are doing me  a favor in serving there food.  The heavy set ny owner needs to stay in the backround and have someone with a personality talk to customers.  You have guys like jerry folding napkins instead of being aware of the customer right across the table.
Food great/ Service not a winner here!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place...brings me back home to NY everytime. Fresh bagels, bread, snacks and goodies. The guys are awesome and the girls up front are always nice and friendly.  Many smears to choose from and the liver pate' is very tasty. I especially love their Baklava when they have it. Yummy."}
{"text":"Sitting in this place makes me think of eating on the set of Seinfeld. I literally felt like I was in NYC having a snack at an old school jewish cafe. It's busy and everyone there was in their own little world. Either reading the papers, catching up with friends or stopping by to pick up deli meat, this place is worth checking out. However, if you came here for the bagels, fo'get about it, there are better things to have then the bagels. I was super stoked to check out this place but I have to say, I was a little disappointed. 

The food is good. It's not amazing, its good. The service honestly, could be a lot better. I like sarcasm, I don't like to be patronized. I get it, you want people to feel like you're in NYC, but I still like good service, at any restaurant. I like the overall atmosphere. If you're looking for a quick bite to eat or just a whatever place to have breakfast or lunch, this is the spot.  

They have a pretty big menu which is nice because it gives everyone an option. But, the one thing to have is the matzo ball soup. I've never had it before and I knew I had to try it. I can't imagine eating at any other place more Jewish than this. 

It arrives and it steaming hot. The steam alone had flavor. It was so delicious. This broth had to have been made by a 90 year old grandma in their kitchen. It's everything chicken noodle soup needs to be, plus the matzo ball. If I was ever sick, this is the soup that I would want, hands down. The flavors were intense and then subtle and then suddenly you're reminded of sitting in grandma's kitchen being served soup. Oh, just writing about it makes me want to have some.

If you save room, you'll find that this place has a great pastry shop. All the sweets are gigantic, so plan on sharing. The deli bar is okay. I've had better service and sad to say quality at my local grocery store. It's sad because people can have a much better experience if this place started looking at how the staff treats the guests.

Ciao and until next time, have eating everyone :)"}
{"text":"The best bagel sandwiches and bagels in town! You honestly can't find anything similar. I usually just get my order Togo and there is always a line because it's so good. They have a huge selection of different types of cream cheese, my favorite is the jalapeño herb. The selected of bagels is also large. You have to get there early because your favorite bagel might be sold out. I just love this place and I can't say enough! The egg white and Swiss on a everything thing bagel with the jalapeño herb cream cheese is a must!"}
{"text":"You have to wait for your food I would say 20 mins , because everything is fresh and just good quality. Gotta love it! Bagels made in house as well as Their baked goods!"}
{"text":"One of the best places I found in Vegas for a traditional East coast style deli experience.  They have a large selection of fresh bagels made daily with most flavors and styles you can imagine available.  They have a very large dessert case with some very decadent entries.  They also have the good old fashioned big old piled with meat deli sandwich available.

The Pizza Bagel is always enormous and tasty, but its a tall order to finish it alone.  The deli sandwiches are similar, piled high with your choice of various deli meats.  I always liked the cajun spiced turkey breast as well as the classic pastrami, but you really can't go wrong.

If you're from an area that has true delis and are missing it, give The Bagel Cafe a try.  Its the closest thing I found to what I love about visiting NYC."}
{"text":"Great food, but absolutely horrible service especially at the check out. The guy who helped us with the bagels was rude off the bat, but once we decided to head over to sit down to eat, he started staring at us and complaining about us in our presence to the cashiers. We were very rudedly told, almost reprimanded, that we were not allowed to sit down if we were going to take out the food. We just didnt know! We understand that there are policies, but the way that the staff explained that to us was very inapproprate. It was as if they were mad and we were children that needed to be scolded. When paying for the food, the cashier rudely told us that we cant do that. We ate our food in our car, annoyed and upset. The food was good, but not good enough to come back despite the bad customer service."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast food, love that the bagels are made New York style; it's all about the water. Over crowded and the staff is alright not the friendliest but they were at least semi-cheerful.
The parking situation is horrible and a big detraction from the accessibility to this place."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you want a delicious meal for breakfast or lunch. They have a variety of bread, bagels, and wraps to choose from, and they also offer options that are not sandwiches. At first when I ordered my over stuffed bagel sandwich (spinach and feta bagel, lemon pepper turkey, avocado, lettuce, bacon, tomato), I thought the prices were a bit high (almost $12 for a whole sandwich). However, you get a lot of food for the price! They also brought out a snack for us before our food was ready. My sandwich was super tasty, and it was large enough that I was able to take half of it home for another meal. It also came with a choice of potato salad, macaroni, cucumber salad, etc.. The restaurant itself is very clean and pleasant, and the women's restroom looked like it was well maintained. This seems like the kind of place that can get busy quickly, so I would plan on a wait if you come here on a weekend day! On a Monday around noon, there was no wait."}
{"text":"A great deli in west Vegas. It's bustling with NY atmosphere and the food couldn't be better, from the hearty homemade soups to the outstanding bagels and blintzes. The chopped liver is excellent. Portions are more than generous, at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I love bagel cafe, their pastries are incredible and the dining room is inviting along with the service is friendly. All their menu dishes are very generous portions, I do recommend to all the locals. Hands down!!"}
{"text":"This place can do no wrong. The lox bagel platter is one of my faves, as well as the challah bread french toast and the reuben. The bakery section is ridiculous. I tried the raspberry coffee cake and as expected it was amazing. Huge selection of bagels and the house made cream cheeses are divine, especially the cinnamon raisin."}
{"text":"One morning I decided I liked my roommates(hehehe) and I stopped by this place to pick up breakfast  (BAGELS).  When I walked in, it was clean and nice.  They had a great selection of Bagels and Vream Cheese.  If your a Garlic Lover, they have the best Garlic Cream Cheese Ever!  Their Prices were great and their Staff was helpful in every way possible.  And I have stupid questions like \"How do I get the Bagels\"  lol

Anyways,  It was nice, but a little pricey on their deli section.
I will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a certified Chicken Pot Pie Freak.  No one does it better than the Bagel Cafe.  For those who drive to Las Vegas, put your car to good use and drive here.  At least 5 times better than any buffet or Casino Restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo overrated.  The first thing you notice when you walk in is the nasty, rancid smell that permeates the place.  It's an odor that is not the odor of cooked food, it smells rank!  You will see the bakery and deli counters as soon as you walk in.  The selection is limited, the bagels are better at Einstein's bakery and the baked goods are obviously not baked on sight, but shipped in from someplace else.  I've tried several of their baked goods, and none are extraordinary.  Much better pastries can be found at Patisserie Manon on Charleston near Rampart.  As for the food, very overrated.  The food is nothing special and if you go for breakfast the coffee tastes like water. If you live  in or near Summerlin, and want an infinitely better breakfast, try Griddlecakes  in the Von's shopping center on Village Center Circle, or at the new Cracked Egg in the Smith's shopping center on Hualapai and Charleston.  Both are less expensive, have better tasting food,  have better atmospheres without the nauseating smell, and the service is better."}
{"text":"Excellent food no question. If we're in the mood for deli then this is the place or their sister location at South Point. 

I have no doubt I will return here many more times as I have gone more than a dozen times. That may sound strange with three stars but that is solely because of the attitude of staff. Most all employees there, especially the young ladies who work the checkout counter, look completely miserable and act as if they would like to see you drop dead. Always some yelling or conflict behind the counter among staff too. Most people who take orders are clearly bothered. 

No, I'm not from New York and no, I don't know \"How we do 'tings.\"  I just have this silly idea that when you give people money they should attempt to not look irritated. Strange because staff at Del Mar in South Point are always awesome and helpful. 

Thanks for the great deli food. And if any other customer or member of the management of this location would like to tell me I'm just too sensitive or that the staff are not miserable and acerbic, then you are all most welcome to BIOYA."}
{"text":"There are very few Las Vegas eateries that we would go back time and time again and Bagel Cafe is one of our favorites. My goodness this place is the best! We have been here eating their delicious food so many times they should give us a reserved parking spot. Good sized portions, fresh ingredients and super service. What more could anyone want? Do not miss the freshly squeezed orange juice, the wide variety of real deal bagels and schmeer, or the beautiful pastry case. We always buy a treat to take home.  Can you tell we love this place? Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Service lousy
Food bland 
Toasted bagel only warmed
Wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"Food is good but watch out for the 2 fat dudes behind the deli! They like to make rude comments amongst themselves and laugh at customers.."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I'd been told that the chicken salad here was amazing. It wasn't. It was bland: just mayo, celery and white and dark meat chicken as far as I could tell. No pizazz.  No flavor.  The sandwich comes with a side and I wanted the pasta salad but they were out of pasta salad so I tried the coleslaw.  I usually love coleslaw, but the coleslaw was also bland. Sadly, even the pickle sucked. It tasted like a cucumber that hadn't fully turned into a pickle yet.  Also tried a few sandwich-style butter cookies (which I usually love at other places).  But this place skimped on the chocolate filling, so they were disappointing, too. Add a bottled soda and the total for my takeout lunch was just under $19. (I did not get a itemized receipt, either.) That and unfriendly service, too? Yikes!"}
{"text":"This place is bagel heaven and one of my favorite spots! They have so many bagels it's easy to miss one. Today, I discovered the chocolate chip bagel and I love it!! I topped it with strawberry cream cheese which had big chunks of strawberries in it. It was delish! Some other favorites of mine are the potato cakes, chocolate soda, and of course the lox plate. Soooo good! Bagel cafe keep doing what you do!"}
{"text":"The food was really good. My husband got us a bagel with cream cheese, omlete, potatoes and a really good blueberry muffin! The only problem we had (which I took 2 stars away from) is the service! Oh my goodness they where rude as hell! And then where pissed off that we didnt tip them! It sucks when you have a resturant with good food but crappy people ugh!"}
{"text":"I found this gem today because for a craving for a chopped liver sandwich.  Its a little bit out of the way.  It took me around 20 minutes to drive there in traffic.  Well worth the trip.  It was a beautiful day.
When I arrived I was taken by how bright and clean it is.  Checking the menu I was in heaven.  They even have kishka, and chicken soup.  I was met by two sweet young servers who took my order.  Of course I got my chopped liver sandwich with a side of potato salad.  The liver was great but I didn't care for the rye bread.  It wasn't dense enough for me, but still quite tasty.  I have only one other tiny complaint the pickle had almost taste.  I was told that I would have had to ask fore that spicier pickle.  My advice is to forget about the first no flavor pickle entirely.  I finished my meal with a cheese danish and coffee.  The coffee was excellent but the cheese danish was heavenly.  Just amazing.  And its huge.  So big I couldn't finish it.  I'll have it for breakfast before I check out for my trip home. Total tab including a huge freshly squeezed orange juice was around $20.  I  saddened that I discovered this place on the last day of my trip.  But I WILL return on my next time."}
{"text":"Finally we found a great bagel deli in Las Vegas!  We came on a Saturday mid morning and were very pleasantly surprised. From the other reviews, maybe we got lucky because there was a car pulling out so parking was not a problem. And there were a couple tables open, so there wasn't a wait, plus our service was excellent.

We had a breakfast sandwich, a pastrami sandwich, matzo ball soup, an everything bagel, a sun dried tomato bagel, and the scallion cream cheese. The bakery section looked great and tempting but we were just to full. The bagels and cream cheese were phenomenal, huge and delicious. The pastrami sandwich was so good and big, definitely enough for two, but unfortunately the side potato salad wasn't very good (not a big deal considering everything else). The breakfast sandwich and soup were very good. 

This is over a half hour drive from our house, but definitely worth it and we will be going back weekly. The bagels, cream cheeses, and sandwiches are a MUST. Next visit we are looking forward to taking food home so we can enjoy desserts from the bakery section, it looks so good."}
{"text":"Wife and I arrived Sunday morning for breakfast\lunch.   One young man took our drink orders and shortly after our waitress Anna came over to take our food order.    Wife ordered a pretty tasty bagel with light scallion spread.  I ordered a large pastrami sandwich.    When my sandwich came out it was cold and dry.   Maybe that was due to the waitress possibly forgetting about our table... not sure.  It took 30 mins for the food to arrive.   After food arrive,  waitress Anna disappeared for more then 15 mins before she came past our table to ask how we were doing.   At which point I told her about my cold pastrami sandwich.... she offered to take it back and warm it up.... I told her no because I don't like my food removed from in front of me once it's served.  I just wanted her to be aware of it and that I was going to eat it anyway because I was starving.     Service was very very poor from my waitress and for getting drink refills.    Kind of disappointing."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a friend and it was a pretty good experience.  Our server, Victoria was fantastic!  The food is great!  Unfortunately service at the take out counter....not so much.  Ordered some treats to go and the cashiers are no where near as friendly.  5 stars for dining in and 1 star for take out."}
{"text":"A friend came over with 5 pastries the other night. Sorry to say that only one of the pieces was edible. The other 4 were so stale i was embarrassed. I have shopped there in the past and know they are not cheap but they have to learn to throw things out!!!! The portion size was big but what good is it if you cant eat it?"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday and despite it being super crowded, we didn't have to wait long to get seated. In the mean time, we split a blueberry muffin that was so delicious and buttery that it was worth the calories! My husband got a ham, egg and cheese on an everything bagel. I ordered a turkey on an everything bagel. They were amazing and definitely the best bagels in the valley. 
We came back here a few months later with my mom and sister because I had noticed how delicious the homefries and pancakes looked. I was incredibly impressed with both. The homefries have the perfect amount of seasoning on them, with both crispy parts and soft parts. The pancake was huge and light and fluffy, and almost tasted a little nutty. They were so delicious and you can add on a pancake to any of their breakfasts for just a little bit extra. This place is amazing and they have a huge selection of bagel flavors and a dessert case that will make your salivary glands start pumping...cakes, cookies, pastries, muffins... etc etc. etc. This place knows what they're doing and you wont' be dissapointed. Expect to wait a little bit on weekends and it can be a little cramped, but who cares when you're getting excellent service and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"so..this is My first time here ...so I walk in on Saturday lunch rush...the place was packed but it did not take long to seat us nonetheless....I ordered the combo
Reuben....it was probably the best sandwich Ive truly had in forever....it was 
a great flavor of pastrami and corned beef......the portion was huge and the fries 
I didn't even touch.....I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a true deli 
and bakery......and don't get me started on the bakery selection.."}
{"text":"Never again.  Worst service, management and staff I've ever seen.  Arrogant snots running this place.  Fortunately for me, I can spread the world never to go tot his place again to a very large senior citizen community nearby.  You never tell someone your grill is not operational because you are cleaning it well after the order is placed, and you never blow off a customer waiting to be served at the deli counter when there are several workers standing right there.  I cannot emphasize how arrogant these idiots are.  But you know what, you are going to lose a ton of business now.  

The manager is a moron too.   He offered for us to come back, but no way. Service is and always has been a problem there, so he could care less because of the sheer volume of people that come through there.  Arrogance at its best."}
{"text":"My girlfriends took me here on a weekend afternoon. The place was jamming and busy but not to the point where it was overkill.
Thier bagel sandwhiches are a great price and desserts are awesome!"}
{"text":"This place delivers as usual! Great food, awesome service, wonderful atmosphere. It has been a minute since we have been here & it never disappoints. This my wife's favorite spot for breakfast & it takes me back to my to short stay as a kid in NY. Easily the best place to find a NY bagel. We will be back again & again!

Happy wife happy life....."}
{"text":"I will never go there again?  After 8 years of being a customer the manager decided it was my fault they got 3 of my last 5 to go orders wrong.  He said it's my responsibility to inventory the order before I leave.  I told him I pay you to do that when I spend my money here.  He kept on saying it was my obligation and I was wrong.  The last order they messed up they did not include the cheesecake.  And he offered nothing to correct the problem other that to keep blaming me.  I said I have a job and checking to see you do yours is not apart of it.  

Worse yet a spend 50.00-100.00 each visit.  Now I'll spend it elsewhere who appreciates long time customers."}
{"text":"Simply the best NY-style deli in town! Everything is made fresh, in-house from the bagels, to the pastries, potato pancakes and matzo ball soup. Large portions just like you'd get at a NY deli. They even do catering! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"When I went to buy Lox & a Knish on Tuesday evening, September 7.  I decided to go to a Chinese Restaurant closer to \"The Bagel Cafe\".  I felt it was foolish to drive home & only to go back pretty much to the same area.  When I went inside the Restaurant for dinner, I asked if they could put my purchase in their refrig.  They did!  I thought it would spoil while I was eating y dinner.

The next night, Wednesday, I ate some Lox & the Knish.  I got sick from the Knish, it was spoiled.  The consistency of the potato was flaky as to the usually smoothness like mash potato.  So, I happened to be near \"The Bagel Cafe\" on Friday.  I decided to tell them that it was spoiled.

I got an argument from the clerk who told the Manager & he gave me more of an argument.  That they put it out frozen & after 3 days they thrown them away.  They sold out the whole batch & I am the only one that complained that it was spoiled.  What happen to the Customer is always right!

As I was leaving I said, \"under my breathe\" loud enough they could of said, is there anything else we could exchange it for.  The manager must of heard me.  He then said, \"do you want some cake or something\".  And, then I said to him I was not going directly home.  And, then I mentioned about put this package in the other Restaurant Refrig, then he went on another Rant.  You don't know that they did with the package & I said, \"the package came back to me the exact way I gave it to them\".  I just walked out & said, I not coming back\"."}
{"text":"A vegas staple. 

My wife and kids love the fresh pastries and desserts. 

I come for the bacon (I know, weird), corned beef hash and the multiple cream cheese flavors. Just heard they have gluten free bagels, so that is a pleasant surprise. 

Family owned and a great spot for lunch/brunch."}
{"text":"What a find!  We either ate there or got food to go 4 of 5 days of our trip! We had corned Beef Hash and potatoes,  knishes, cabbage rolls, potato pancakes,  a reuben, bagels every day, cookies,  muffins, cupcakes and sweet n sour soup. Everything was absolutely amazing and it was so hard to decide what to order because everything looked so good!!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent food fast and nice reminds me of NYC diners"}
{"text":"Add this long overdue review to the others that sing the praises of this efficiently-run local deli. When eating out can play it safe for breakfast and order a simple standby OR you can explore a bit of culture via a thoughtful menu with quality ingredients.  The thing I love about The Bagel Cafe (TBC) is that here you will get a great meal no matter your breakfast habits. I wish I could say that I choose a unique breakfast when I come to TBC, but I do not. I order eggs (scrambled or poached), bacon, bagel, and fruit whenever I come. When I'm ready to venture out of my comfort zone, I'll order the smoked fish or hand sliced nova platter. It sounds dull, but I am proud to say that of the MANY times I have eaten here I have never been disappointed. Sure there are some slight variations in the food preparation, but the quality of the ingredients and care in preparation at this place never changes. 

A NOTE ABOUT THE BOOTHS: We seated ourselves and moved form one booth (too much sun) to another and discovered something unexpected. The tables at both booths were set farther back than we felt comfortable. Usually a booth table will be fairly close to your body, but I had to lean in during the meal to be closer to my plate. I am sure that people who need a it more space are more comfortable as a result of the change. 

FOOD: My NY mom and I visited recently and the cultural gap between us couldn't have been more evident than in our plates. I got the usual (eggs, bacon, bagel, fruit, with cottage cheese) while she ordered the overstuffed pastrami with chopped liver. People like me, looking for a meal we can order in any restaurant in the valley, will want to keep coming back to this place. They care about what they put on your plate in this place and they cook the food right. You won't be disappointed in dry, overcooked eggs here. And yes, as many have said, the bagels are amazing. I prefer the veggie spread--there is no equal in this town. The bacon has changed over the years, and I wish it was less salty, but it is always thick cut and flavorful.

Mom's pastrami was outstanding.  If, like me, you are accustomed to thinly sliced, rubbery meat, you will have to rethink your relationship with this delicious smoked meat. 

When the waitress didn't bring our large fruit cup with the meal,I figured she'd forgotten and I wasn't worried about reminding her. A few minutes later she set down a cocktail-type glass stacked with fresh fruit arranged in the shape of a flower arrangement with pineapple, kiwi, banana, strawberries, and pear. It was a smart way for TBC to remind it's customers that they care about small touches.  

Everything is good here.  I can't wait to get back."}
{"text":"In the interest of full disclosure, I have never been to New York, either state or city.  I have no idea what a \"real New York Deli\" is supposed to be.  (And from the conflicting opinions of the people on and off Yelp who attempt to describe one - including my darling wife, who lived outside of NYC for several years - I guess I'm not the only one who's confused.)  That being said, I'll fall back on the old saying that \"I may not know art, but I know what I like,\" and continue.

The food here is outstanding!  My wife, who was raised Jewish and, as I said, lived right outside NYC for several years and is experienced in New York delis, thinks her grandmother works in the kitchen making matzo ball soup.  I've never had a disappointing meal here.

The pastries are ... well, addictive.  And did I mention huge?  The deli take-out counter is also fantastic, with imported-from-New-York specialties and lots of house-made goodies.

The service is above-average, but sometimes a tad less-than-perfect due to the crowd size.  Nothing that would prevent us from coming back.

The only real knock I have on this place is the seating.  My wife has had several back surgeries, and I have a bad knee-and-hip that makes regular chairs a frequent issue.  We can't always be provided a booth when we arrive, simply because there aren't all that many of them and they tend to go quickly.  It certainly isn't anything that would keep us from coming back.

Other than that one little tick, you'll find the Orchid and I frequenting the Bagel Cafe often.  Good stuff, people.  Well done.

{"text":"This is my option the best bagels in the valley. ..And the best off strip deli... Friendly nyc staff..the prices are a bit high but in my opinion well worth it."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom nom nom....

I've been to this place twice, and it's always been pleasing. This time around I had a chili omelette. Yes, yes, I know, it's called \"Bagel Cafe,\" not \"Omelette Cafe.\" But there's so much good stuff here, I couldn't resist. I did have an onion bagel though with it, and it was tasty. If I'm not mistaken, they make all their bagels, so you knew it was fresh. I'm a big fan of delis, and I REAAAAAAAAAAAALLY wanted the pastrami bagel sandwich, but I went with breakfast. It's another one of those places where you're constantly torn between breakfast or lunch.

I was a little disappointed by the service this time, but normally it's pretty good. I do have to say that I saw my friend's chicken noodle soup. It looks ah-MA-zing. Maybe I will have to get that with the pastrami sandwich. If I can just get past the breakfast portion."}
{"text":"Fresh delicious food. It's really everything you could hope for from a place called The Bagel Cafe. The bagels are great. The breakfast sandwiches are awesome. The prices are totally reasonable. There really isn't much more to say. Eat there."}
{"text":"Came in to get a dozen bagels to go. The order went fine, but when I went to pay they had apparently given my bag to someone else. Then they ran out of the bagels I ordered. The cashiers at the to go area were not paying attention at all."}
{"text":"I've lived in vegas ten years and this place just gets better. From their killer breakfasts with perfect bagels, to the mile high deli style sandwiches, and last but not least their bakery which makes the best cookies and rugelach."}
{"text":"Love the food and the service was excelent .thanks for that great lunch. Liked the variety and prices."}
{"text":"I have driven by the place a hundred times and I sure do wish I would have stopped in sooner. They are so much more than a \"bagel cafe.\" They have a huge menu with lots of options. My co-worker is a huge fan of their soups - She has them for lunch regularly. I enjoyed some Bagel & Lox - delicious. Service was friendly and pretty quick even though they were really crowded."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! My girlfriend and I went for dinner on a Wednesday evening. We had never been. What a nice surprise! Katie Anne was our server, and she was a delight.

Highlights:
-complimentary bagel chips & dip
-large portions (which we weren't expecting!)
-very friendly staff
-delicious food (everything we ordered was great!)
-meatloaf was moist & yummy
-mashed potatoes tasted homemade
-yunmy Yelp check in cookie

We will definitely be back!

UPDATE: Came back for dinner on a Thursday with friends. It was still delicious and great service!"}
{"text":"Have been going to this place 10 + years (off and on). Prices going up, quality going down. To top it off the thin fella  that is mgr (or an owner) seems to think that he has to talk to people like they are idiots (customers and employees). We picked up some baked goods on the way home last night and he was rude enough to my wife that I was ready to leave without purchasing anything, but my wife passed it off. After we found that 2 out of 3 of our choices were basically stale, my wife made the decision that we will not be going back again. A real shame because it used to be worth waiting to get in there"}
{"text":"Kind of a long wait, usually a good sign, was well worth it.  Phenomenal food, excellent service, and a bakery to die for.  Plan on putting on some weight.  It was my first time here, but whenever I go back to Vegas, I will always find my way here."}
{"text":"Amazing NY bagel shop in Las Vegas. It is always busy and there are always New Yorkers in there. The bagels are amazing, along with their varieties of cream cheese. Their lox, knish, and baked goods are incredible as well. If you have time, stay for the food. I recommend any of the eggs Benedict and the challah French toast. Huge portions and huge personality. Get some ruggulah to go."}
{"text":"Great experience, fantastic soups and bagels.  Had the matzah ball soup and a bagel for a great price, very good coffee too and excellent service."}
{"text":"They do both take out pastry/bagels as well as a sit down restaurant at which you can order from a menu of HUGE proportions of food as well as the take-out items,
The dine-in food was good. I had the omlet, it was huge and it was enough for two people! The service was pretty good and it was clean. I was glad to get a booth, most tables are just sort of stuck in the middle of the room. I have never seen a wait for seating but it always seems busy!
Most of the time I just do the take out items, which range from \"mini\" cheesecakes (around $5) to homemade twinkies (with not quite enough filling), to bagel & egg sandwiches(more reasonably priced around $4). Everything is very large but so wonderful, I've never gotten something I didn't like!
My favorite dessert was the lemon bar, its amazing! I even opted for one instead of a birthday cake :)
The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the price. It is a lot of food but some of the desserts and menu items seem to be on New York or Strip prices. Oh well it is worth it :)"}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast, lunch, desserts, anytime.  The staff is always friendly and on top of things.  You may have to wait on weekends but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!
Best bagels in Vegas... This place reminds me of the shops in NY. They are fresh, took notch quality and let me tell they don't scrimp on the shmear. Loads of spread enough to spread on another toasted bagel (which I've done before).
Einstein's has good tasting bagels but they scrimp on the shmear and are more $$. 
For a great bagel this is the place."}
{"text":"We usually come here about twice a month. Tonight was just weird.  Just finished dinner at the Bagel Cafe. Not sure we will be back. First, the place was empty at 4:15 PM. Next, no one spoke understandable English. Our server was floundering with the language and three items we requested, they were \" out of\". Server had to actually check to see if they had corned beef & cabbage available. Desert is included with the dinner and is limited to just two items. One is the crumb cake. Server told us they were \"out of\" crumb cake and we would have to settle for the second choice. When we went to pay at the register, the wife saw 4 pieces of crumb cake in the display case. We asked to swap our desert for the crumb cake and the guy at the register said something unintelligible  in a heavy Hispanic accent and gave us just one then told us he cut it in half, otherwise we would have gotten a larger piece. WHAT?? I'm still shaking my head over that one!
So now, this NY Deli has all Hispanic staff.  Cooks are Hispanic, as well as waiters and register attendant. Does this now qualify as  Mexican restaurant?"}
{"text":"We went as a group of about 20. The waitress got the orders right and made sure we had everything we needed. We've been to the Bagel Café a number of times and never had a bad meal"}
{"text":"Our family of four ate here on a Tuesday late morning. This place was packed the whole time. The bakery offers excellent pastries and bagels to eat there or to go. The omelets were delicious, the blintzes a little dry and the coffee could be better. The service was definitely NOT attentive. The seating was uncomfortable as our little table had to accommodate 4 with a full menu. The furniture of tables, chairs and boots were dated and pretty beaten up, not very appealing, and definitely too crammed next to each other. After lunch we took several pieces of pastry to go and it was delicious."}
{"text":"The best Rainbow Cookie I have ever had, Don't get me started on there bagels, I just went back to New York and had to get some bagels and you won't believe this. There bagels were better"}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint. If you're a fan of sandwiches, bagels or omelets, this is a fantastic place to try. You seat yourself, the newspaper style menu's are on your right and you will soon be served. The 3 times I've been there, the food was great. Reuben, bacon and cheese omelet, and a ham and cheese collectively were a 8/10. You can order for pickup or come in and pickup some bagels, which are AMAZING. Soft, big and chewy even when toasted."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Like nothing else in town! The portions are ridiculously huge! I make the drive from across town and never regret it!"}
{"text":"It's a little piece of the East Coast here In LV and we fully enjoyed it.  

Corned Beef on Rye - pretty legit, just slightly drier and sliced thinner than I'm used to but plenty good enough.  Pretty lean too.  The bread was excellent, flavorful and fresh.

Latkes - giant and humongous.  One order can feed a huge family.  Was very dry and probably wouldn't get these again.

Pickles - just my personal preference, I like full sour and these were like half sours.  Meh.

Cole slaw - was on the thinner, drier side too.

Bagels - excellent, big and giant which some may not like but I love the puffier style bagels.

Service - mixed.  Started out pretty good and petered out.  It took forever to get out bill and change back.

Bakery - yum!  The challah is pretty decent and their cookies are tasty.  I'll eventually work my way through all the baked goods, I'm sure.

It's not as good as most of the better delis on the East coast but it's a good enough effort for me to come back when I need a decent deli fix."}
{"text":"5 Stars (Excellent)- This is my all time favorite spot for breakfast and lunch in Las Vegas. I have been coming here since they opened in 1996 and have always had an excellent experience. Ma & Pa owned and operated with care which you can tell by the outstanding food quality. Most authentic Jewish Deli and fresh bakery outside of New York City. The pastrami sandwich is the best in all of Las Vegas period!  The soups (matzo ball especially) are amazing and of course the rye bread and traditional cookies are done correctly. It is common for this place to get pretty crazy busy from time to time especially around lunchtime. However they do the best that they can and are always courteous, friendly, and helpful staff. Thank you Bagel Cafe for the years of superb food and fresh bagels!!  Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"This was my seconds time here. 
I bought 4 bagels-spinach cheese, sour dough, cranberry bagels,  half lb lox cream cheese and strawberry cream cheese, black&white cookies and
, chocolate rugulach, apricot rugulach. 

The spinach bagel was ok. 
The chocolate rugulach was a bomb. Soft and chewy. Plenty of chocolate but not overly sweet."}
{"text":"Oh, sweet black & white cookies!

This place is awesome. There is no other word for it. No matter what time of day, it's always crowded. However, even with the crowd I always get excellent service. 

This is one of the best sandwich shops in town, if not THE best. If you can believe it, the bologna is to die for. The roast beef is also delicious. It doesn't have any of that gag-worthy pink sheen that you so often see on roast beef.  The egg-salad is perfect - I think the secret ingredient must be some sort of bottled love of grandmothers. The restaurant has got a handle on the details, and I love that.  Menus that look like newspapers. Homemade pickles. Special cream cheese.

Oh yes, the cookies. When you first walk in it feels like walking into Wilka Wonka's chocolate factory. The dessert case may even have angelic lights shining on it. Everything is made daily and is well-worth cheating on the diet. 

Although the prices are a bit high (around $10 for a sandwich) you will definitely have leftovers for lunch the next day. My 4 out of 5 stars is because the prices are a bit much to keep me from eating there on a regular basis and the parking lot is a bit harrowing."}
{"text":"Overrated and expensive. Bagels are tasteless - tried egg, sesame and one other. Anyone connecting them to NY bagels needs to try a good NY bagel back east and reconsider. Corned beef saved the second star in this review."}
{"text":"Who knew you could get good nosh in Vegas? The bagels are so soft and lovely on the inside, and crispy with fresh toppings on the outside! The super egg and onion looked so good...must get that next time! The homemade corned beef is phenomenal on a Reuben (ask for it on marbled rye...you won't be disappointed). The coleslaw is outstanding, and their new pickles are so scrumptious I could've eaten a dozen. Loved all the videos of how they prepare babka, potato latkes, knish, and bread....I will definitely be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I'd been to the Bagel Cafe before (for, what else, bagels), so I knew they were open for breakfast and lunch. But unlike most delis, they are also open for dinner, so I thought we'd give them a try for takeout. (I've never eaten in the restaurant, although seating is available.)

Like most delis, they offer a huge menu of meats, fish, sandwiches, and pastries. And like most delis, they are pretty expensive. But you get a lot of food for the money, and they offer half portions of their sandwiches if you're not that hungry.

My husband had the combo reuben (a full portion), which was equal parts corned beef and pastrami. Like most deli sandwiches, this was overstuffed with meat. And while the meat was tasty, the abundance of it threw off the ratio of the other ingredients, so you couldn't really taste the sauerkraut and cheese. That said, it was a pretty good sandwich (although I'm not sure if it was $14 good). The reuben was served with fries and a side of too-sweet macaroni salad, both of which were unnecessary and were basically uneaten.

I wasn't as hungry, so I got a spinach knish and a quarter-pound of whitefish salad as a side. Together, this was under $8. The knish was fine; I've had their meat and potato knishes before and thought I'd try the spinach (the others are better). But the whitefish salad was great. It reminded me of the fish dip at Ted Peters Famous Smoked Fish in St. Petersburg, Florida, and I ate it as such: like a spread on crackers (which I had at the house). Not sure if you can eat it this way if you dine in, but I bet you could ask for some crackers and serve yourself up some tasty Vegas fish dip!

Next time, I'll double up on the whitefish and skip the knish. In fact, I'm craving that whitefish now ... See you soon, Bagel Cafe!"}
{"text":"The bagels here are dense and filling, and their cream cheese makes it that much better. From blueberry cream cheese to the one with chives, they are all flavorful. In addition, I had their pastrami omelette and it was filled with a ton of pastrami and was delicious!"}
{"text":"Had my sons 6th birthday cake made here & it was delicious! It was a fantastic display, just what I was looking for. You know you have an incredible cake when all the parents eat some too! Will definitely order cakes here when I need them!"}
{"text":"This place has always had tasty food but the service lately has just been worse than bad... I went to get 2 breakfast sandwiches and they messed up the order and put bacon instead of sausage. Oh well I got over it. The following day I went to try and get the correct sandwiches and they still messed up my order!! Didn't even put any meat on it this time. It's disappointing because I did like this cafe and I realize they are busy but both time were very simple orders..."}
{"text":"Sooooooo good!!! The bagels, the breakfast, lunch, bakery and staff are great! I've been eating here since I was a little kid and my parents used to take me all the time. Now, in 26 years old and I still go there. In fact, I took my now fiancé of 4 years there for our first lunch date nearly 4 years ago! She's obsessed with it now too! Go get a bagel and cream cheese, some fresh lox, or some incredible marble pound cake, or they're awesome cheese danish... Omg. Great. Now I'm hungry..... :) 
My mom used to know the owners back when they were still here and she could tell you where certain realtors would come in and sit at the counter on which days and she'd be right. Lol 
Those were the days.... They've had some changes, but they're still awesome! Makes me happy to claim my Jewish half"}
{"text":"True East Coast bagels in Vegas.  Amazing.

Pastries are great, sandwiches are flawless.

Always packed on Sunday mornings, which only makes it more fun.

You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"First time here. I was surprised at how big it was inside. It was very busy, but our wait was not that bad. 
Our server was sweet. She checked on us often and my drink was always filled. 
The bagel chips & sweet dip was a nice free appetizer while we waited for our lunch. 
I tried the Pot Pie! It was yummy! 
I will definitely be back to try some of their pastries. They all looked great!"}
{"text":"As a young Jewish girl living in Vegas, I grew up eating Bagle cafe with my family. My father gets the challla for Shabbat every Friday from this place and religiously get breakfast here because it's so addicting. Not only is the food incredible and worth the price (not to mention the drooling desserts), but I always feel welcomed and the staff is always on top of it. It truly feels like a little slice of New York and home."}
{"text":"I had hoped service here had improved since our last visit, but after today, I am convinced this subpar service must be the norm for the place. Owner even messaged after the last review, so really hoped it had improved. But just as a frame of reference, I typed most of this review out while waiting for our server to just check on us to see if everything was ok(that's how long she was taking).

Arrived on a busy Sunday brunch, so we more than expected to wait a little. After being seated at the table, it took 15 minutes just to get drinks. Then another 15 minutes to have our order taken. Waited 20 minutes to get food, only to have it delivered to the table with things missing, like butter for pancakes. Also discovered our table had zero utensils set out for a party of 5.

Waitress scuttles away so fast that we could barely tell her what we needed, so more waiting. 

Usually I love the food for its authentic Jewish fare. Today, I ordered the potato pancakes. Huge, thick portion of 3 pancakes but served with the tiniest serving of sour cream and applesauce. I would expect the $10 cost could cover a bit more condiment with the dish. The patties are so dry that you need something to balance it, but the scale does not fit what they serve. Also took forever to flag the waitress down for this to get a little more.

I should have stuck with my original assessment and just stop in to the deli to get my fix of NY food."}
{"text":"Extremely good bagels. Purchased a dozen and a half for a company meeting.  There was a mad dash for the bags when I entered  the office."}
{"text":"For years now this is my Togo place whenever I'm not feeling so great or just miss home. Their matza ball soap is my favorite thing on the menu. It's so reach with flavors and perfectly done. Over the weekend they have long lines but the great service and good food is really worth it. One more thing the cakes are to die for lol my favorite is the cheesecake :) enjoy"}
{"text":"They have sturgeon and it is always fresh and delicious. 

I've never had a bad time here or had anything I didnt like. 

My favorite: fish platter for two, sturgeon and nova.

American style breakfasts. Jewish deli sammies. Soup: very good. The restaurant stays busy and that makes for always fresh foods. 

This is the place for Jewish Bakery in LV. Cookies, cakes. Yum!"}
{"text":"YUMMY! This place is so good. Definitely make time to get some food here. We came three days in a row for breakfast. It's that good!"}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorites and a true staple in the Las Vegas community. There is nothing better in my opinion than grabbing a cup of matzoh ball soup and a half sandwich from bagel cafe.

The only thing that I don't like about this place is the face that there can sometimes be an extremely long wait when attempting to pick up food from the deli counter. 

As for recommendations: the pastrami on rye is killer, as mentioned before, the matzoh ball soup is unreal, and the black and white cookies will change your life.

I love the bagel cafe, and I'm sure you will too!"}
{"text":"Sandwich was just okay, potato salad sucked. None of it was worth 15.00 next time I go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Sorry this restaurant does not allow me to protect my family. As a legal gun owner I am not a felon or a domestic abuser. I can't say the same for the person sitting next table over. This is sad because my wife loved your food but now that we know we are not welcome we will eat at another place that welcomes us."}
{"text":"Wow - how can you NOT love Bagel Cafe?! Watch out for the huge portions! We had the soup & half sandwich combo and when I ordered my chicken salad on a bagel, they brought me a whole sandwich anyway! GREAT matzo ball soup! Service very good. My husbands from Brooklyn and he says this is a legit NY Deli. Will come here monthly!"}
{"text":"Bad customer service when ordering for delivery. They didn't deliver my full order and when I called them they were not helpful and just put me on hold.  Didn't give me a refund - just claimed that my food was there. Why would I waste my time calling them in my Saturday if my food was there?"}
{"text":"This has become a favorite of mine while living here. I have recommended it as on off strip stop for friends as well. They have loved it. 

The inside reminds me of being in New York at times due to the amount of people inside. 
The wall of bagels and tubs of smear are overwhelming. You name it, they have it. I'm so in love with the Nova it's not even funny.  

They have a very extensive bakery case. I can't even explain the yumminess! Tarts, cookies, cakes, cinnamon rolls. Oh my. 

The deli options are amazing as well. I have not eaten at the restaurant but the menu looks appetizing and the place is always full!!"}
{"text":"Heard so much about the crab eggs Benedict that I just had to try it. I drove from Chinatown all the way to the bagel cafe on buffalo just to try this much recommended plate. 
 Monday  2:00 pm the place wasn't busy, went in right away and sat myself, place looks very nice and clean. The menu is in a newspaper form, very nice but I prefer the ones with color pictures. (need glasses)
Waitress came over ( very nice by the way) offered me drinks and asked me if I needed few minutes to decide on my meal.
Oh no thank you!  I know exactly what I want! I'll have the crab eggs Benedict that I heard so much of! Drove all the way here just for that, can't wait to try them! Ah, with extra sauce please.
-\" sorry we don't have that right now \"

{"text":"I've had a lot of pastrami in my life, and theirs ranks right up there at the top. The lox plate is an excellent appetizer for the table as well. Love this spot!"}
{"text":"Not impressed !   The desserts in the bakery side looked delicious upon walking into the restaurant!

My bagel was NOT a real New York style bagel, but had the taste of a cheap bland bagel (and it was an everything bagel)   Very Very disappointing!    Had the pastrami sandwich, was pathetic in size to any pastrami sandwich I ever got in a New York Delicatessen...and to top off my bad meal was 2 pickles that tasted rotten -- verified by my other eating partners!  Will NOT be back -- especially at the prices they charge !"}
{"text":"I'm a New Yorker, born and raised on the likes of Rattner's in the East Village and transplanted here. There is no \"great\" deli food. Give me a bagel (a bagel's not a bagel unless it's a bagel. If you're from NY, you know what I'm talking about. The Bagel Cafe has BAGELS. Unfortunately, it like most others now has stepped into the non-traditional, with chocolate chip, blueberry and other flavored circles of dough which are most assuredly not bagels, but muffins. They don't count. Anyone who eats 'em out to go to Freeds and buy cupcakes.

A good plain, egg, sesame everything, poppy seed and sesame seed bagel is what the Bagel Cafe has along with a variety of cream cheeses and great lox. It purveys pastrami sandwiches that are every bit as good and as large (I buy halfs) as New York -- and they all have the right amount of fat. Similary so for corned beef. Of course you can order them \"lean,\" but what's that about. That's just fake deli meat -- After all, ya gotta die of something and my motto, one of the anyway, is that I don't want to die with a tuna sandwich in my hand.

Give this place a go, a regular go -- It has great baked goods as well, fresh."}
{"text":"Horrible experience at take out. Been going there for years, but today I couldn't have my order my way. Counter man told me if I got what I wanted he would get written up. Consulted with manager, who recognized me as a customer.  No one interested in fixing it. WENT ELSEWHERE.  YOU SHOULD TOO!"}
{"text":"Best NY style Deli and restaurant in town! The Chicken soup with Matso ball is the best. For breakfast any of the bagel plates and fish are recommended and the desserts are first rate! Love the home made Corned Beef Hash for breakfast and their fresh ground coffee puts Starbucks to shame!"}
{"text":"I love this place and have been coming here since I was a child. However, my latest concern is placing an order ahead of time or paying ahead of time for a take out order. I only get a short period of time for my lunch break. It's hard to come here and get out on time to make it back to work. They should really look into letting people place orders over the phone and paying up front for their orders."}
{"text":"This is a typical New York deli plopped into northwest Las Vegas. They provide large portions... with large attitudes and prices to go with them. I find the bagels at other bagel shops (like Einstein Bagels) more flavorful and less gummy and I was not impressed with the black cookie I received with my order. The bakery items in the cakes and specialty item case looked really tasty. I also saw they had halvah, not commonly available in Vegas.

The schmear was terrific (I had the low-fat veggie) and the vegetables on my asiago bagel were fresh. The pickle was so fresh that it tasted much more like salty cucumber than pickle. My meal came with chips. When I asked to change the plain chips for another flavor of the same brand and size, I was told: \"This is what comes with the meal.\"

The service is typical New York--they weren't mean, but they certainly won't go out of their ways to greet you with a smile or make you feel comfortable."}
{"text":"BEST bagels on the West Coast, I kid you not. I literally thought I was back home in NY. Staff exceptional, service A+. Wish I had taken a dozen home."}
{"text":"I am totally hooked on the chicken salad.  OMG - the absolute best!"}
{"text":"Just average nothing great you can get the same food in any bar around town except bagels you can get those fresh at smiths if your hungry and have no other choice here's your place"}
{"text":"This is my every Sunday go to place for breakfast. I wouldn't know about anything but the cinnamon French Toast. You can only get it on the weekends!!
For lunch, the pastrami and corned beef are the best!"}
{"text":"I had surgery and can only eat child portion on restaurant menus. I have a doctors note to explain this and although restaurant have no obligation to accept it I feel that those who don't are more concerned with their profits than honoring a valid medical request from  paying customer. I  Have ordered sides and appetizers from here in the past & I end up still eating too much & being sick.  We got the manager involved and he also wouldn't accommodate my dietary restrictions. I feel bad that I wasn't accommodated. I ended up not order anything. Bagel cafe left me with a sour taste. In these days where dogs and cats are allowed in restaurants, not to accommodate a customer with a valid medical note and dietary restriction is bad business. I don't feel like a \"valued customer\".  I won't be returning. There's Lots of restaurants in town that will respect my personal health issues and will see me as a person and not a dollar sign."}
{"text":"Amazing food and the service was top notch. I had the nova lox and a dozen bagels to go. My husband is from NYC and this is as close to their deli as you can get. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Whenever we are in VEGAS The Bagel Cafe has the best breakfast and lunch!
LARGE PORTIONS and the Bakery Is Delicious and everything is oversized.
Red Velvet Twinkies are sooooo good.
It is a must try in VEGAS."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday and it was a seat yourself situation. Service was quick and they brought over a sample of their pumpkin cream cheese. The cream cheese was good but not enough to make me want to order it.

I ordered one egg with bacon, homefries, and an Asiago bagel. The bagel was good but tasted more like a plain bagel than Asiago. The bacon wasn't great and I didn't like the homefries much.

Overall, i'd only recommend coming here for a bagel. They have tons of flavors."}
{"text":"We had bagel breakfast sandwiches and they were super good! The carrot cake cream cheese of the month was very good!"}
{"text":"No better breakfast spot in vegas hands down. The bagels are the best in town. The cabbage soup on Mondays is the real deal. The sandwhichs are stacked and will not leave you disappointed. Service is good for the most part. Last but not least their deserts are absolutely deadly."}
{"text":"Really good bagels and a nice atmosphere.

I passed this place by for years thinking it was basically just an einstein's, and I am glad to discover it has a full dining room.

The food is good, standard breakfast fare, but featuring their authentic bagels. Lunch includes deli selections straight from New York.

Prices are a little high, and only open during breakfast hours, I would love it if they stayed open all night."}
{"text":"I can honestly say I'll always  be a customer. There so amazing. They had me feeling like a kid in a candy shop. It's a definite must try if u haven't."}
{"text":"First time in this place, I haven't seen a deli here in Vegas that quite looks like NY deli. I ordered toasted bialys and my friends got a bagel and it was good. I did not try the hash brown. I asked for over medium egg and it came over easy. The Canadian bacon was 3 pieces as thin as a dime. They have an array of desserts and the menu is quite extensive. It's good for a try. I may come back again and try other food. Being a local New Yorker, this place is average."}
{"text":"I have been coming here forever! I come get bagel breakfast sandwiches before class ;-) The best deli and restaurant on the west side. Mark said it was the best french dip sandwich he had ever eaten. ever."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite Sunday morning breakfast places! I love the omelets and bagels that they have here, get the garlic cheddar cream cheese it is great on all the bagels! well maybe not the raisin one but hey, give it a try anyway!!"}
{"text":"Be sure to leave room in your carry on. I can't come to Las Vegas without a stop at the Bagel Cafe. Their food is amazing. By far the best bagel I've ever had. The fresh squeezed orange juice is fabulous and their lox platter is to write home about. They are extremely generous with their portions.  The cinnamon walnut cream cheese is out of this world."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Not very convenient for me and in a medical complex. But the food is worth every bit of the commute!! To start, the fresh squeezed orange juice (chilled) is so refreshing. Each table is given some bagel chips and choice cream cheese to enjoy while ordering. The menu is very large, which is expected for a place like this. Today, I enjoyed the western omelette with home potatoes and a side bagel. The omelette was large and full of meat and veggies!! The potatoes were perfectly cooked! But the highlight of the meal, was what my father ordered..... the almighty fruit and granola yogurt parfait!! This parfait was hand crafted with a lot of love! It was over flowing with fresh fruit (apples, bananas, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, mango, kiwi)!! You must see the picture to fully understand the beauty involved!! I can't wait to go back and enjoy one of these on my own! A+++++"}
{"text":"My rating is based on service alone. The waitress was nice, so that is why I am giving two stars instead of one. I had to wait almost 15 minutes to order, after my waitress disappeared. Considering the location is in a business complex, I would assume many people come here between appointments or on lunch breaks, so ordering in a timely manner would be appreciated by many. 

Once my food finally arrived, the Philly cheesesteak has peppers on it even though I ordered it without. It didn't have the side of mayo I ordered either. I did not have time to wait for a new sandwich to be made, so I couldn't have lunch. It seemed odd that such a simple order wasn't fulfilled. I was really looking forward to trying this place because the decorations were cute and I expected a NY restaurant to have good food."}
{"text":"I do like this place but if my friends were not planning to go here, I do not think it would be my first choice for lunch or breakfast.

Been here a few times before, got seated quickly with a party of 6. Took a little bit to order but that was okay as at least we were given our drinks. I ordered a bagel breakfast sandwich with cheese and one egg, and some breakfast potatoes. Both were alright, not the best, but it left me satiated. 

My crazy boyfriend however, had the LARGEST slice of tiramisu cake I have ever seen in my life. I thought it was the entire cake. He downed that thing like a champ! I didn't take a bite but it sure looked good!

Overall this cafe is alright - not my favorite, but I don't oppose to it either. Kind of limited selection for vegetarians which is why for me it is one way or the other. I will have to come in some other time to grab some black and white cookies from their bakery, as their desserts seem to be more mouth-watering than their other goods. Maybe I'll find something yummier next time."}
{"text":"Lunch today was busy as usual, service was good, food was fresh. I feel like it was just thrown together though rather than treating it like an art or craft. Then again, this is also just a cafe."}
{"text":"The service and the food has gone so downhill lately. Used to be so much better. We complained to the guy who said he was the manager and his name was Jerry. He just stood there and laughed at us. I guess when you do so much business you don't need to care about your customers or in this case ex customers. I wish yelp would allow negative stars."}
{"text":"I think they're food is great!
Service is slow, almost everytime 
And the waiters don't pay much attention to their customers besides dropping off the food and check.
The coffee there is awful! 
No taste at all and extremely watery. 
If they bought another coffee brand& trained their staff to multitask and be more efficient I would come more often."}
{"text":"So the one previous time I have been here my bf and I ordered breakfast bagel sandwiches to go at the counter. Which were HUGE and delicious (from what I remember anyway). I must admit, I think it's pretty cool how they've got the bagel display and other treats set up. It's just a comfy cozy kinda feeling to me. 

Last time we came it was mid morning and this place was p a c k e d! So this morning we opted to go about 7:30a just after they open to avoid the crowd; and we did just that. We were invited to seat ourselves when we walked in and immediately upon seating we were greeted and asked for our drink order. This was a good start and excited me because after our recent trip to PR I was glad to get great and quick customer service at a home town restaurant. 

I ordered the spinach and feta cheese omlet (added tomato); it came with home fries and a bagel with cream cheese. The bagel I loved. The home fries were ok. In the omlet they used fresh spinach which was great, I hate when restaurants use frozen or canned crap. Other than that I didn't really care for the omlet; I'm super picky with eggs and the eggs in this omlet were dry like over cooked, & it had browning on the outside of it which to me is disgusting. My bf had a bagels and lox; he loved it, just like he loves everything. 

The reason I give this place a 3 is because the food here just did not knock my socks off AND because they charged $4.50 for an orange juice, really? After we left I made the bf go around back and see if there was an orange tree back there because that's the only reason I can justify paying that much for a glass of juice, is if the tree is in the back growing those damn things and picked fresh daily. Lo and behold, there was no tree. I'm willing to give another try though sometime in the future. Their service though is definitely a 5 stars; from the friendliness of our waitress to how quick the food came out (under 10 min)."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place, I would recommend to come here early in the morning if it gets past 9 AM on a sunday or Saturday the place is packed. The bagel is the best in Las Vegas the prices are good based on the quality and quantity of the food being served. Make sure to come here HUNGRY otherwise you have to bring the food home. My daughter  gets her chicken fingers and the servings are enormous enough for an Adult Large Meal.  The service is good , although due to the amount of people the service degrades a bit which is completely understandable. If your looking for  A Simple breakfast with good quality and quantity this place would be it."}
{"text":"Yum! Great menu, lots of choices. The sandwiches are giant like a deli sandwich should be. I'm anxious to go back and have a breakfast there :) The bagels are awesome, like bagels are supposed to be....nice, dense and with great flavor. Will definitely come back to this place for more bagel sandwich goodness!!"}
{"text":"Bagels, bagels and more bagels...which I do not eat anymore.  I do however enjoy watching everyone enjoy them and say how good they are.

Bagels are not the only thing on the menu.  I can only vouch for breakfast of which they do all manner of breakfast food.

The service is friendly and quick on the coffee refills.  

TBC is a great place to enjoy the most important meal of the day."}
{"text":"Ordered two lean corned beef sandwiches to bring home to ill parents.  Corned beef was very fatty--not lean.  We were in no position to return them to the Bagel Cafe but would have if we could.  Instead we tried to pull the fat off of the corned beef and it was an expensive lesson.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Always consistent with great food and service... Definitely recommend this place... I hit it every chance I get when I'm in Las Vegas. Recommend the pastrami corned beef all of their Breads and desserts are awesome."}
{"text":"hi,  place posts own fake good reviews, this is a REAL review from a REAL person
:
this  is the worst restaurant i have been to in las vegas, first: their baked goods are old and hard ! they buy their bagels frozen and defrost them ( i saw the bag).
the food is awful, . we ordered brisket sandwich, potato salad, chicken soup, salmon platter, pastrami sandwich, hamburger with cole slaw (the hamburger was immediately sent back it was hard and flat as a hockey puck :  (    cole slaw was gross and slimy, ... the sandwiches were tasteless
the pastrami : not edible, the soup was cold and from a can, the potato salad came from a plastic tub. they are making nothing homemade as they \"claim\", the salmon was a salmon substitute ( very gummy after one bite, i was afraid to eat anymore in a chance i would become ill).. all of their food is frozen and microwaved.go buy a frozen sandwich, microwave it thats what our disgusting sandwiches tasted like for quadruple the price!!.. the waitress told me and rolled her eyes, she also told us she found a new waitress job because they have to tell customers food is homemade when nothing is made there and she did not want to lie to customers. i repeat DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE"}
{"text":"TLDR: The namesake bagels are surprisingly well done here: large, fluffy, and great with lox and/or their cream cheese- the green onion is my favorite, and they're all made in house. The matzo ball soup (better than the version at Weiss) and thick-ass pastrami sandwiches are also pretty great. 

2 ounce lox plate with a spinach and feta bagel and cheddar-garlic cream cheese: not a combo I'd normally opt for, but somehow it all really worked together- the fish was fresh and silky and plentiful, the bagel toasty and chewy, the schmear chunky with cheese and fragrant with garlic. Everything was plated beautifully too, a leaf of lettuce under all of the thick slices of tomato and red onion, a russian pickle, several slices of cucumber, and a handful of olives, too.

I peeked in the pastry case \"just for a look\"- and walked out with a \"small\" black and white, that was easily the size of my hand. Great cookie, overly sweet frosting. My BF samples a different cake each visit and hasn't yet found anything he dislikes.

ETA: Pizza bagels (particularly the fresh spinach and feta) are divine, especially on the garlic bagel;  the tongue sandwich is also light and silky and delicious."}
{"text":"The best bagel and veggie snear I've had. This place was amazing!!! The bagel was light yet full of flavor. This place is worth a 30min drive just for one bagel. I will be sure to visit this place next time I fly to Vegas."}
{"text":"Great east-coast style deli in an unsuspecting location.  I've just been once, but the bagels and coffee were excellent, especially the bagels.  There's a big bakery and an extensive lunch & dinner menu.  My potatoes were cold, but that's my only complaint."}
{"text":"Sadly this place is brought down by terrible customer service and inconsistent take out. Seems like it gets worse every time I give them a try. It's too bad because the bagels are fantastic when the order is put together correctly."}
{"text":"FOOD:  5 Stars -- Their deli and restaurant food is killer delicious,
LOCATION:  3 Stars -- A little dicey to find and parking at the busy times of the day.
ATMOSPHERE: 4 Stars
PRICE: $$  (2 bagels and coffees were $14)
SERVICE:  NO Stars -- It Sucks!  Surly wait-staff.  No greeting when I came in. No one cared if I lived or died. Today (02/19/2013) was the last straw. I found two flyers/notices that had fallen off their door (and were laying at the door step), brought them in, and tried to get someone to notice me so I could give them the signs.  After 7 (SEVEN!) minutes of watching four people who blatantly ignored me, I threw the signs in the trash.  If you're not a \"regular\", you (apparently) are crap to them.  I couldn't even get someone behind the counter to notice me when I tried to buy some pastries.  Wow. They must be resting on their laurels and believing this is how to treat newcomers.  No wonder they can't grow."}
{"text":"Love this place, been here multiple times only reason it didn't get five stars is a few times the for was warm and not hot."}
{"text":"This is an amazing spot for brunch. The food is pretty basic, but still very good. They have a way of taking the standard deli fare and transforming it into something exceptionally delicious. I usually get the egg sandwich with cheese on an everything bagel, which I can highly recommend.

Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"The best breakfast spot in vegas! Been going for years and the food quality hasn't changed one bit ! I Always get the make your own bagel sandwich. The prices are so cheap!"}
{"text":"The number of bagel places in Las Vegas is very limited. This is probably the closest I have had to a true New York style bagel. It's certainly not the best bagel I've ever had but it is certainly the best bagel I have ever had in Vegas. They had an excellent cream cheese selection with approximately 11 different varieties including light options. Cream cheese flavoRS where traditional veggie, scallion, locks, and a rotating flavor of the month. We had their jalapeño cheddar bagel, asiago bagel, plain bagel, and Sun dried tomato. We had the bagels toasted. The bagels had a nice chew and crunch. Forfour bagels with two of them having specialty cream cheese we spent $10."}
{"text":"Their CRAB CAKE BENEDICT was the bomb!

It came with jumbo lump crab meat as advertised in the menu, and it was sooo delicious. I don't appreciate the Hollandaise sauce that much, but it was also outstanding.

The fresh veggie omelet came with spinach, tomato, onion, mushrooms and bell peppers - was good but not as impressive as the bennie.

And the bagel - came with the nova cream cheese (mixed with smoked salmon) and it was great."}
{"text":"The place was packed on Saturday Morning which is a positive sign. But I was not over the top impressed.   

The menu is cleverly done on a newspaper and it took us quite a while to decide due to so many choices. 

I ordered their Matzo Ball Soup which was pretty good, and my hubby ordered an Everything Bagel with Nova Spread, Potato Pancake, and a Knish which we didn't care for too much. Since the soup came with a bagel, I decided to try a Cinnamon-Raisin Bagel with Cinnamon-Raisin spread which was quite good.

The French Toast was something we had to try after hearing good things, but that too was just so-so. Maybe we'll give the bakery items a try if and when we return."}
{"text":"When it comes to being the best Jewish Deli  in town... This place is definitely- HANDS DOWN! They have the best rugelach! I love their Tongue Sandwich- I barely chew it! Matzo Ball soup, my all-time favorite!

Never leave without getting something from the pastry counter. 1 pastry itself is good enough to feed 2-3 people!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! My other half and family are all from NY and think that the Bagel Cafe has the best deli in Las Vegas. We have even gone so far as to wonder if they are bringing water in from NY! Bagels are fantastic... Matzo wonderful! Everything is delicious! Customer service is so so...But who cares because the food is great:) they would be five star if the cashiers were polite."}
{"text":"Best bagels in town - I know because I searched high and low.  This place has the feel of a neighborhood diner and Jewish deli wrapped in one.  No skimping on the schmear here.  I get the everything with veggie cream cheese, and if I am hungover I have a bacon, egg, and swiss on sesame.  Then I eat celery for a week and feel self loathing.  

It's in the middle of a non descript commercial strip mall in Summerlin, but I come from downtown and run into people from my building here.  Fresh, yummy bagels.  It's not NYC 5 star bagels, but its the best I've tasted outside the 5 boroughs."}
{"text":"The Bagel Cafe is one of my favorite breakfast places! & one of the first places id recommend for breakfast. Located in a strip of office buildings that is visible on Buffalo. It can get pretty busy, but that is because it is soo good! Parking lot is pretty congested since they do share with other offices.They have a bakery as well, great baked goods. Traditional breakfast, they also have lunch items on their menu. Orange juice is freshly squeezed. Cream cheese is home made, delicious flavors! Staff is so kind & timely. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Originally this place was going to be a 5 star for me. The place has a great ambiance with a nice sitting area. Looks like a great homestyle diner. Super excited, I ordered a pastrami ruben on rye. It took about 30 minutes for the to-go order to come out, which was a bit disappointing. That's ok I guess, but when I finally got down to try the rye, it was flavorless. That's ok again I guess. There's only one thing though, that really really bothered me. Coming from New York, I love me a good Black and White cookie, and the Bagel Cafe displayed these gigantic beautiful Black and White cookies, and boy was I excited to try this glorious cookie. It looked so delicious. I wanted it... I wanted it badddd.....

Now in my mind, a Black and White cookie is the beautiful love child of a cookie and a cake: soft inners with just enough crisp to keep a firm shape and texture. When I went for my first break of the cookie, it felt soft, and not just soft, but cakey. That's ok, I guess again....... Maybe the frosting would be better? No... The frosting was way too soft. I have to say, this place came off as a possible diamond in the rough, but every part of it was just more and more disappointing."}
{"text":"Very good Matza ball soup.  Bagels are large too.  Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Been coming here for 17+ years - always good.
Cabbage soup on the weekends is like grandma used to make.

2nd weekend in a row eating with my boys here"}
{"text":"OMG delish! Love love love this place!!! They have so many options and tasty foods!!! Plus the service was on point :)"}
{"text":"My husband recommended Bagel Cafe for brunch.  He'd been there before based on a review that rated them as one of the top 3 soup places in Vegas.

Nice neighborhood in Summerlin, clean and pretty new.  In front of you when you walk in are large displays with smoke fish and other bagel condiments, various fresh bagels, and a nice size offering of huge cookies and pastries, including chocolate chunk cookies, macaroons, rugelach, rice pudding, flan, turnovers, brownies, and more!

This is a \"seat yourself\" place with quick, friendly service and a whimsical menu that looks and feels like a small newspaper.  The menu offerings are numerous!  I had the biscuits and gravy - yum!  They make their own biscuits and they were soooo much better than the kind you can make at home and they were huge!  My husband had matza ball soup.  After tasting it I understand why they were rated one of the top soup places - wow!

The prices were very impressive!  My humongous biscuits and gravy were only $5.95, $7.50 with two eggs.

I doubt we will often travel across town to eat here, but if you're in the area it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is Amazing! A variety of foods and top quality deli! Feels like I'm in New York."}
{"text":"So much food you'll either have to share one dish or take some home!
They have NY style deli sandwiches, and food for all times of the day.
Their bagels far outdo Einsteins and they have quite a variety of cream cheese for those. You can either sit down and eat there or pick it up for to go.
The food here is amazing and it's always busy because its so damn good. 
My only complaint is that parking sucks, but it often does at busy/awesome places."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place for family and friends. Really great environment with good food."}
{"text":"The Bagel Cafe is one of the best breakfast spots in Vegas. I always recommend this restaurant to everyone, there are so many different options to chose from. Their bakery area is phenomenal and almost overwhelming! Definitely love this place!"}
{"text":"The bagels and food are very good!! The service is hit or miss. Some are great and some are terrible. Ordering behind the deli or bakery is a nightmare. The girl at the register will stand there doing nothing and not help with bakery while the guys behind are busting their butts. It's really ridiculous. The manager should sit down with their staff and discuss team work."}
{"text":"My hubby and I love the bagel cafe, we really enjoy taking our 89yr old grandpa there.  He loves the matzoh soup, tuna salad and the sandwiches, I really enjoy the fresh OJ and the house salad.  It's always busy when we go, but there is always a table available and the food comes quickly."}
{"text":"I come here for their chicken noodle soup, bagels,  and their dessert! I need to mention they have the best Tiramisu in Las Vegas! And they're prices are  great!! Love this place and the staff is always smiling :-)"}
{"text":"I do have to say this is the best you can get in Vegas for a Jewish deli. You can go to to the counter to take your food to go and there is never a lack of workers. You can order off the regular menu and it is nice because you can see all the sides up close to see which ones you want if you get a sandwich. Great selection of cream cheese spreads (lox being my favorite). Bagels are cooked perfectly and the perfect amount of chewy! It is so hard for me to get the perfect bagel after being spoiled growing up eating good bagels from LA. This bagel is a match to what I grew up with. They also have really friendly service although a bit rushed. 

I appreciate the sugar free rugelach and the large cookie and sweets selection. I do love the chocolate rugelach the most. Not too sweet. I think their corned beef is really good unlike other places in town that it is dry. It's not cheap though. Overall I think the prices are above what they should be, but it's one of those places I would pay for good food every once in a while."}
{"text":"Really really disappointed...have been there before and was good. But this time the pastrami was TERRIBLE!
Cut very thick and was very tough, could not bite thru, needed to eat sandwich with a knife n fork.
Even then, was very tough to chew! Only ate half of sandwich.
Not sure if I'll return !"}
{"text":"It's what you expect from a deli, but only better. 

First and foremost, THE MENUS ARE SO CUTE! They're pretend newspapers... love love that idea. 

The prices are ridiculously cheap. The bagels have unique flavors (sundried tomato?!). And the bakery... oh man, oversized delciousness.. if you're in the mood to splurge on calories, get the humongous cinnamon roll (I shared it with a friend, and we still could have used 3 other people to help us out... but we were champs, and ate the whollle thing, ha!)

Apparently the salmon platter is bangin, my friend says she usually gets that with fam. 

But this time, we made our own bagel sandwiches... Sundried tomato bagel with scallion cream cheese, tomato, and a fried egggg... And like I said, reallly cheap..


As far as service goes, it's what you expect from a deli. Nothing amazing. People just there to get the job done."}
{"text":"I have been coming to The Bagel Cafe on and off for a handful of years now and have to say it's honestly the best place on this side of town (aside from an Einstein's) to get some deliciously fresh bagels!
 I am really only a bagel customer, as I've only sat down to eat once in the past, but from the dozens upon dozens of bagels I've had the pleasure of eating, I'm happy. 
The desserts are pretty great too! On my most recent visit I got a blueberry danish and it was amazing! 
The line might seem confusing but trust me, these people know what they're doing. I've never been wrongly skipped or had my goodies given to the wrong person. Don't worry!"}
{"text":"Outstanding restaurant! We had the roast beef sandwich, macaroni salad, side of Sturgeon, bagel and Nova smoked salmon (less salty).
I did ask for my bagel not to be toasted and it came out toasted, this turned out being a great mistake by our server because it was really good. The best bagel I have ever had. I can't wait to go back and try all of their gourmet flavored cream cheeses.
The sandwich was perfection. The homemade pickle was discussting.they should make a few different pickled types, it tasted like a half done pickle. The macaroni salad had too much pickle flavor, would not order that again.
The Nova Salmon was a perfect amount for my bagel and sodium content was balanced by the fresh fish flavor.
We tried an eclair ! It was huge, the size reminded me of a six inch sub at subway! The pudding cream inside was incredibly addicting, they should sell that seperatelyI could eat it by the spoonful! I was hoping they had more mini dessert selections, we would've tried more and spent more.
My sugar cookie, had a smiley face on it, tasted like dry shortbread. I did not like it at all, I prefer chewy cookies. I saw multiple servers eating on the job coming from a back serving room, not the kitchen, that was weird, we're they eating off old plates? Also our server checked her watch multiple times, made me think she wanted to get out of work and rush us. 
The man at checkout was very nice and engaging. We can't wait to come back and try more."}
{"text":"The menus are discussing dirty!!! Gluten unfriendly. The brisket sandwich had so much fat on it you had to tear it apart than it was too hot to touch so than the bread fell apart:-(.  It took for ever to get cashed out. It was freezing cold inside and it's winter.  The glass wear was dirty.  The forks where bented need I say more?"}
{"text":"I went with two friends on a rainy Friday afternoon for a late lunch. The cafe is located in an unsuspecting plaza filled with lots of medical and realtor offices. Parking was decently easy to find. Even though we got there around 1, there was still a 20ish minute wait for a table. While you wait, you can look at all the desserts and bagels they have on display. You have the option of dining in or taking out.

Their menus are already at the table and are fashioned after newspapers. I thought it was extremely adorable.

I ordered the homemade matzoh ball soup and toasted asiago bagel with scallion cream cheese. I must pat myself on the back because that bagel/cream cheese combo was so bomb. The bagel had just the right density and springiness to it with every bite. It's no wonder they're called Bagel Cafe. I also snuck a bite of my friend's everything bagel with nova cream cheese and plain bagel with blueberry cream cheese. The nova cream cheese was awesome, and I definitely wouldn't mind paying the extra dollar for it. This was my first time trying any kind of matzoh ball soup, and I enjoyed it enough. It's basically a glorified chicken soup--it got better with every bite.

Given that I have been nonstop complimenting their food, why the three stars then? The service was atrocious. The busboy delivered us our waters right away, but after that, it took forever for the waitress to actually take our order. I actually noticed two tables who were seated after us got their orders taken first and some of their food delivered before us. We had come at the tail end of lunch, and the crowd was dying down. There was absolutely no excuse for the waitress to ignore our table like that. The busboy actually stopped by and asked if our orders had been taken/told us that he'd get the waitress for us. She never apologized for ignoring us/being slow, but she was very fast at giving us our bill. 

I will very likely be back for their bagels, but I am wary of dining in again.

4 stars
-2 stars for the awful waitress
+1 star for the busboy"}
{"text":"Dear Bagel Cafe, PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE.  IT IS HORRIBLE.  The food here is GREAT.  GETTING AND PAYING is AWFUL.  So bad in fact we no longer come for sit down or take out.  This is SOOOO sad.  The people at the register need to be FIRED.  They are rude and incapeable of taking people in order.  Please, we are paying premium prices and being treated like crap.  Also, if you folks are really from NY you must know that tipping is dependent on SERVICE (not just in the resturant but the to go area AND BEHIND THE REGISTER).  It is not a right, so let's try to be nice......even if it hurts.  Your business will improve, believe me."}
{"text":"This is a little slice of the east coast in Vegas. Bagel cafe has all the trimmings of a full scale deli and restaurant. The deli side has fresh meats, fish and favorites such as chop liver, on display and ready to order. 

The restaurant side has comfy seats and a wide menu. 

Try the Asiago Bagel, toasted with cream cheese, tomato and lox. 

The pastrami is cut to order and great. 

The only downside is that they do take their time. You could easily wait 10 to 15 min for a order at the deli counter, so make sure your not in a hurry."}
{"text":"**Original review from 5/5/2011. Updating new profile.**

Another place I must visit when I'm out in Vegas. Of course, I've only been here 3 times and each time I get the same thing. Lump Crab Eggs Benedict. Heaven in my mouth! I don't come here for the coffee, which is drinkable, but not the best. I come here for this heavenly lump crab dish.... and the deli/bakery items. My mom had me try the potato cakes last time we were there and..... excuse me. Had to take a breather. Just thinking about those delicious, wonderful potato concoctions with the apple sauce.... Yummmmmmmmm.

The cafe service has been great for me each time. The last time I was there was on a Sunday morning and they were jam packed!!! The waitress was great and attentive, even though the place was packed. On busy days, I understand poaching eggs can be a little difficult because there's a lot more to pay attention to, so when I pointed out that my eggs had been overcooked, without hesitation, she comped me for one of my favorite things in the bakery. (I didn't want them remade.... they were still edible)

The bakery staff is why this place didn't receive a 5 star rating from me. Since I'm still new to the place, I didn't know that you had to stand in line at the deli to get service at the bakery. No one spoke up and when I tried to get the attention of one of the guys, I was blown off. When I finally received service, I placed my order and then asked for something from the deli. He treated my request as a big inconvenience. Needless to say, if it's a busy day, I'll just eat at the cafe and leave my bakery/deli order for another, less busy time.

Their food is great. Their bakery and deli items are delicious. I would recommend this place to everyone and anyone, but I would tell them to be patient and try to go when it's not so busy."}
{"text":"Great food! We will definitely come back. We had the bagels with egg and bacon and fresh squeezed OJ. The pastries are delicious!"}
{"text":"Cashiers need to be trained with how they handle customers.  I purchased a Ruben sandwich to go.  After I received my sandwich, I decided that I'd rather sit down and eat it.  I told the cashier that I wanted to sit down, and rather than being courteous and finding me a seat, she told me that the tables are for people that order food from a waitress.  Ridiculous!  I guess spending $15 for a sandwich, fries and potato salad isn't enough for me to to sit down at their establishment and enjoy my meal.    

I wouldn't recommend this place based on the customer service alone.  I definitely won't be bringing my family or friends."}
{"text":"I picked up a half dozen bagels of various kinds. Toasted them for breakfast and found each one to be tasteless. If you had a blindfold, there is no way you could guess which was which. 

Probably the worst bagels I have ever had."}
{"text":"Bagel cafe is a great breakfast spot.  The service is a little slow sometimes but the food is always superb!  Awesome fruit cup, great bagels and the matzo ball soup can cure almost anything."}
{"text":"So I love the pastry shop. Ordered about $35 worth of goodies. Was waiting for my table for two. My name was called but because my friend hadn't arrived, she had to go check with her manager to seat me. I was a party of two but I could have been a party of one. Seriously??? Just seat me at the table. How much more can you make by turning the tables every 20 minutes vs allowing me to sit with a cup of coffee and enjoy a lovely breakfast???? Seriously peaved about this. It's not like I wouldn't have ordered even if my friend hadn't arrived."}
{"text":"We ordered the combination plate for 1 and shared! It is totally enough, but you will need a extra bagel. 

It was great, we loved the desserts, they are HUGE! 

One thing that we missed is that the combination plate doesn't come with capers. But still great."}
{"text":"Legit Bagels, just like NY. Best tasting cream cheese ever! The place is always packed. Service is just ok. I go back for the bagels and cream cheese!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and Great comfort food!!!
My wife and I like coming here to eat especially
breakfast. Home made deserts and bakery!!"}
{"text":"Always tastes great service is friendly menu is awesome been going to this place for a couple of years now! Love it!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Our favorite bakery/breakfast/lunch/bagel heaven! We are huge fans of The Bagel Cafe, good enough to bring your out-of-town guests. Black and white cookies are uncomparable, pastrami sandwich is delish and I believe they make their own meat, fresh fruit and yogurt parfait is the best parfait you will ever have (and its huge), pancakes are amazing, chicken noodle soup, homemade pickles may not sound exciting, but they are! For the holidays they make a strawberry rhubarb pie that I order each year. I really can't say enough good things about this place. Family friendly, large portions, unbelievable bakery with everything you'll never know you were missing in life."}
{"text":"I come from NY, this place is the best. I will travel from Henderson to The bagel cafe. Just like home!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place so gave it several tries. The Reuben was great the first time, but the next time arrived fatty and cold. The corned beef hash was corned beef on the plate with the potatoes Not traditional at all. Chopped chicken livers were horrible. Garlic was so heavy I couldn't even eat it. Seriously, I grew up on Jewish food so I do have something to compare it to. Mediocre to me although their bakery is very good. Service slow and not a fan of the wait to get a seat. It's okay, but I'll be trying someplace else. Oh, ordered take out and it was awful. Order wrong, corned beef fatty again."}
{"text":"I have to start with a disclaimer that I grew up in New York/Philadelphia and recently moved from Chicago so I've had probably some of the best Jewish food in the country and I have high standards. I love Jewish food and will spend hours hunting down the best place I can find whenever I move somewhere new. That being said, I can't understand some of the people who have reviewed this place and say it's the best food they've ever had. Most of them have probably lived in LV all their lives and simply don't know any better, because as anyone who's lived near large urban cities probably knows, LV is pretty much an ethnic food-challenged culinary backwater for the most part. 
To be fair, my gf and I stopped by here a while ago on a Sunday at a very busy time. The line was out in the parking lot. I figured the food must be authentic and legit. Wrong! We ordered some easy, quick to make dishes and waited almost an hour, even sitting at the counter with open spots. I get it was crowded, but the service was sub-par, the waitress would disappear for 20 minutes and never bothered to even check back with us or apologize for the long wait. They need to figure out how to serve the public properly, either they're chronically understaffed or just don't have the right systems in place. The lack of acknowledgment of poor service borders on inexcusable and even if the food had been better I still would have thought twice about returning.
The \"fresh squeezed\" orange juice with no pulp was most likely Tropicana, it was room temp to boot. The bagels are doughy and too big, pretty much tasteless. You know it's bad when bagels from Einstein's totally outclass this place. The eggs were under-cooked and mediocre. To me the true test of a good Jewish deli is how good the potato pancakes are. Total fail - they were too thick, not hot and soggy. They basically tasted like a big home fry patty, not seasoned correctly either. It was disgusting I couldn't even finish it. 
They didn't want to substitute anything, and every add-on dish was $6 or more. It was big-city prices for an inferior execution. I honestly lost my appetite and was so disappointed with their \"real Jewish food\" that I couldn't wait to get out of there.
Nothing seemed special or unique about this place - they just overcharge because there really isn't any competition in the jewish deli biz in Vegas. I'd rather eat at Subway then ever go back to bagel cafe. For those of you who don't want to be part of the sheeple herd that seem devoted to this train wreck of a pretend Jewish restaurant, I highly recommend Weiss Deli in Green Valley, Henderson. It's a hole in the wall with spot-on service that can give some of better delis in Chicago a run for their $. The matzo ball soup is served in a trough-sized container and one matzoh ball is literally baseball sized, enough for 2 or 3 to share. The plates there are so big you could eat for 3 days on a sandwich. Compare the two and see for yourself - I guarantee you won't be disappointed. It's doesn't get much worse than Bagel Cafe."}
{"text":"We always come here for the breakfast bagel sandwiches (spinach/feta) is my favorite. They also have a great bakery with a variety of pastries and sweet treats!"}
{"text":"Another one of my first stops when getting back to Vegas.  If you are a New Yorker or just like good food, this is the spot.  I always come here to get a sesame bagel with low-fat veggie cream cheese.  When I am here, it's as if I am back at The Bagel Chalet in Commack!  The black and white cookies  are delicious too!  If anyone is longing for NY while in Vegas, come here!"}
{"text":"I have always been the biggest fan of the Bagel Cafe. I have visited multiple times always for bagels and cheese to-go.   After my last visit the day after Christmas I may never come back...EVER!   Let me start off by saying that it was very early and not busy at all. Just me and two other people in the bakery area.   I placed my order for sliced bagels and cream cheese selections and moved on to the cashier.  At the register, I decided that I needed some soup for our lunch later that day so I ordered 2 chicken noodle soups w/ 3 matzo balls in each.  Didn't seem very difficult and the cashier said that she \"would ring them up but just this one time since it wasn't busy.\"  ??? I didn't know soup needed to be ordered from the guys at the bagel counter...fine, my mistake, now I know for the future.  No big deal.  Here's where it all went downhill.  The cashier that I ordered the soup from rang up 3 soups instead of 2.  When she gave me the total I asked why it was so much? (The bowls of soups are $8.50 each)  She showed me the receipt and she rang up 3 soups instead of 2 which was her mistake.  During the process of refunding the soup you would have thought it was the end of the world that she had to refund 1 soup (which hadn't even been packaged yet).  She turned to another employee and rolled her eyes during the process all with me standing right there.  I spent over $50 on bagels and soups to go.  I told her that she was very rude and why I felt that way.  I walked out to my car which was parked in front of the big huge window by the register and she was huffing and puffing around talking about me to her co-worker.  I watched all of this through the window and made the decision to go back inside for the manager.  I told the manager exactly what happened.  He wanted me to \"just let it go because it was the holidays\"...WHAT?!?! Holidays or not when your employees are unprofessional and losing you business you better address your problems.  What a terrible approach from the manager to know I was treated poorly and to tell me to let it go because of the holidays without a simple apology.

No apology...no yelp stars or business from me.  Never again will I spend my money here! There is something to be said for good customer service and this place doesn't have it.  I noticed some other reviews that noted rude and poor service.  I could have chalked it up to the cashier having a bad morning but with a terrible manager it was a double whammy.  I guess being rude is acceptable and you can put up with it or go somewhere else.

The guy at the bagel counter was wonderful.  This issue was from the cashier and then the terrible manager.    Just because I walked out the door and can't hear you doesn't mean I can't SEE you talking trash about me through your huge windows!

From previous visits during the busy times I learned that you must stand your ground in the line or people will just cut right in front of you. People act like their time is more important than yours and it's like they go ahead of you on purpose.  Nobody ever knows whose turn it is to order...pretty chaotic!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but can't go there anymore because of my diet that restricts almost everything they serve. I loved the food, with one exception - if you are Eastern European don't expect stuffed cabbage will be just like your mom used to make. Maybe for somebody who doesn't know how it's really supposed to taste it will be ok. Breakfasts are amazing, portions are enormous and everything is always super fresh and delicious. Even when it's super busy wait is not too long and food comes fast and yummy."}
{"text":"Fresh bread, muffins and of course bagels. The food is great, very fresh. Large portions, several side choices for the sandwhichs.. fries big enough to share. Breakfast come with a bagel.
The staff is refreshingly pleasant, always full of smiles. They frequently visit to ensure everything's good. Oh and you can seat yourself most days. 


Tons of parking and a newspaper boy that works right outside. Oh and small and large booths"}
{"text":"Best bagel In Las Vegas !staff was also nice!
Only problem is the place is so small, 
and the seating uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Has the best bagels I've tasted on the West coast (so happy to find bagels like the New York bagels I grew up with :) I was also so happy to see my favorite east coast treats and foods like black and white cookies, giant chocolate chip cookies, rainbow cookies, fresh lox w/cream cheese, knishes and cream puffs! :) So happy my sis and brother-in-law found this place :) I can't wait to go back to try everything I saw!!! (I'm pacing myself)"}
{"text":"There is nothing bad in here !! It's true. Amazing bagels, bakery section, I've always loved their sandwiches and there omelets are so good. I remember they used to be in the sun coast hotel and they had some amazing sugar free desserts. I don't know if they make them anymore. Sad . But do go, it's so good ."}
{"text":"The food here is usually fantastic.  The portions are huge and the wait staff is friendly.  You can plan to be waiting a good long while for your food but most the time it's worth it.  I had the special which was an asparagus and goat cheese omelette that was very good but my bagel was burnt, and I was surprised she even served it to me. Today was a mess, but I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! I have to wonder about some of the bad reviews, as this was my first visit to this New York Jewish Deli, but am So Glad I took them with a grain of salt. Ordered \"to go\" veggie omelet w /cheddar, bagel lox sand which and a \"pizza bagel\". Everything from the sweets in the case to the bagels, spreads, meats and FISH ~ omg! ~ looked sooo good!!! When we finally ate our meal (at home), my friend just kept saying \"oh my god\" and \"are you gunna eat that?\" Cuz he wanted it all!! Las Vegas , enjoy and frequent this business!"}
{"text":"The Bagel Cafe is the premier breakfast/brunch destination in Las Vegas.  The service, (while at times very busy), is always friendly and the food is great.  The feeling going there is just like an old school Jewish deli back on the East Coast.  Get there before 10 in the morning on the weekends because it gets really busy.  Fantastic place and I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I can't seem to order anything but the matzo ball chicken soup...I try and try to order something different but end up getting the same thing!  I have tried different bagels and they've always been fresh and wonderful.  The matzo ball soup has always been great, but sometimes (two or three times out of the many times I have eaten there) the soup tastes old and the matzo is mushy.  Most of the time it's great.  Maybe because I usually go late in the day...I sometimes find myself scared to eat there after lunch as I hate the taste of old chicken.  I do love lunch there."}
{"text":"My favorite bagel place in town.  I usually buy a dozen and once I get home, I pop it in the freezer and each time I wanted one, I just throw it in the microwave for a minute and wha la... we have a bagel that taste as if it was just freshly baked."}
{"text":"I have been a fan and regular customer of the Bagel Cafe for many years.  What happened to me today is a game changer!  My wife and I took 3 friends out to breakfast.  As usual the food was good and as usual my wife wanted to take home a pastry as did my friends.  There was quite a long line to pay as Sundays are always busy.  I wait in the pay line while the other 4 check out the goodies.  After about 5 minutes it's my turn to pay and I ask the cashier to add an eclair.  In a not so great tone of voice she says \" we are too busy, you have to order over there\".  I was taken aback by not only the tone but in the past I always ordered my to go pastry from the cashier.  I will grant that I usually eat thier on Monday\"s when they are not as busy but I became defensive from her barking at me.  I stated my unhappiness and she asked if I wanted to speak to the manager and I stated I did so she pointed him out to me.  I walked over to him and explained that I have always ordered my pastries as I was paying and he told me something to the effect of, We don't let the cashiers handle money and food because some money comes in from sick people, casinos and from a \"strippers ass crack\". REALLY! Stuff happens and I sure don't want to take such a good deli off my list but I felt pretty small at that point.  If the cashier was nicer in her response from me I would not have questioned going to another line, but the manager was icing on the cake. We can all have a bad day and maybe I could have handled everyhing different on my end but the attitude and response said to me they just don't really appreciate my patronage"}
{"text":"I lived in NY for 21 years and this is the closest thing to authentic NY deli food and pastries from back home than any other place in Las Vegas. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is your bill can run up high, fast. Freshly squeezed Orange juice runs close to $5. A sausage egg and cheese runs around $8 or $9, but for me the cost is worth the joy of eating incredible food. And the desserts....Fuuugettaaaboutttttittttttt"}
{"text":"Great place to start your day with your favorite Bagel n coffee! Or any other selection on their delicious menu! Great selection!! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Usually one of my favorite delis in Las Vegas. But today's visit was a disappointment in customer service. I ordered a beef dip sandwich with roast beef. It came with delicious crispy french fries and really good coleslaw.unfortunately the sandwich itself was almost inedible.it was stacked high with roast beef and a nice soft roll but the roast beef was so dry it was more like eating paper.it's one thing to have an occasional disappointing meal, but when I talk to management about the sandwich there was little empathy about my situation . I got no apology only excuse is that no one else has complained about the sandwich. Not offered to bring me something else or even discount it since I didn't eat half of the sandwich. I'm sure I'll be back but just be warned if you complain about the quality of the food or that you just simply don't like something don't expect the management to care."}
{"text":"Food has gone downhill while prices have gone up.  Messed up the whole order and never apologized."}
{"text":"Their bagels are the best (I've had) in Las Vegas! But equally as good are their assortment of cream cheeses and their pastries, cookies, etc.

Whenever I'm on this side of town, I like to get their bagel and lox sandwich w/ lite scallion cream cheese. I was there today and someone ordered a pastrami sandwich that looked amazing, so I may need to divert from my standard order."}
{"text":"This place is the best ny Jewish deli , fantastic menu, fantastic service, fantastic prices , just retrain busboy for sanitation and safety , he did a few boo boos , always lift a cup up off table to pour , he almost burned me , and don't put your hands over the glasses to serve , serve them by the base !!!! ,"}
{"text":"I haven't been here for a while & it was a mistake coming here this time for breakfast.   All of the food that arrived was served cold & my eggs were improperly cooked.  Overall, the food quality, execution & service was poor.  Needless to say I will not be back!"}
{"text":"This usual to be a nice place with friendly staff and good food. But the last few times we've been here the experience were very poor. They keep on seating people without regard of the servers being slammed. We sat for over 20 mins at the table without anyone come by to even said \" hi, I'll be right with you\". The busperson gave us coffee and disappear. We had to flag down someone to track down a server.  But people who know the owner got served before people been waiting for long time. The food may be good but I wouldn't recommend anyone to come here unless you're a friend of the owner. This place no longer offer a good eating experience."}
{"text":"Excellent cafe deli and bakery - went for lunch and had a bagel and egg sandwich with bacon - outstanding - got a small eclair for desert - yummy"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried is yummy. Haven't taken anything from the bakery as yet, been coming here for years, not sure how that happened. Bagels clearly a good choice. Soup and sandwiches are tasty as well. Some nice bagel/fish plates. Worth a try but be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"I've been here dozens of times but this is my first time leaving a review. Being an East Coast person of Jewish persuasion, I know my delis and this is one great deli! Food is always good, whether it's breakfast, dinner or just \"a nosh\".  My personal favorite meal is the early bird special of chicken parmesan and comes with soup (I love the matzoh ball soup) veggies and pasta as well as a drink and dessert! Their bakery is also amazing with plenty of choices. I bring new people all the time and never had anyone not love it. Expect deli prices but the food and friendly service make it well worth it! My only complaint are the weekend hours bring so short. Other than that....I love it!"}
{"text":"I have been to The Bagel Cafe a few times now and I think it's A-OK!  

Good option for a bite to eat when you are looking for something quicker than one of the sit-down restaurants at the Red Rock and something better than the food court.

Like Ken M., I too had the Philly chicken, however my sandwich was not dripping in oil and the fries were crispy and delicious.  The staff seems friendly and everything is made to order.  I have also seen the club, the chicken fingers, and a few others.  Everything was good.  

Now, let's not go crazy.  I wouldn't order EVERYTHING off the menu.  C'mon folks, its a grill next to a sports book.   I still advise making your choices wisely.  Maybe avoid the tongue or the chopped chicken liver sandwich?  I'm just saying . . . not my bag baby.  Of all the things I have ordered, I haven't had anything bad.

I say when you want a quick bite (for lunch or breakfast, or even a snack) stop at The Bagel Cafe. Order smart, keep your expectations in check, and enjoy your grill food!  Then, get back to gambling!"}
{"text":"The Best New York Style deli in Las Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service, have had the pleasure of meeting the owner who personally walks around and speaks with customers and he's a great guy! Just makes me want to come back again to support a small business for a hard working man!"}
{"text":"This is my first visit here after a friend told me about it. My office is right down the street and I've driven past it a million times thinking they just served bagels. 

We ordered two veggie omelets with potatos and sourdough bread. For drinks we had 1 coffee and 1 hot tea and I also ordered a cinnamon bun to go for my assistant, because I am the best boss ever. Total cost was approx. $33.

Plate presentation was amazing. Everything here seems to be supersized and looks delicious. The 4 pieces of sourdough toast between us was probably a half loaf of bread! Yabba Dabba Doo!

The omelets were very good: Fresh vegetables mixed into the egg and cooked thoroughly... I'm picky when it comes to undercooked eggs. The only criticism I can offer is there was a lack of salt, but there was salt at the table so we added salt to our own to taste.

The potatos were ok. Nothing really exciting about them. My wife asked for no onions in her omelet and when the plate was delivered the potatos had onions.  No biggie.

The restaurant serves as a bakery and deli as well. The bakery side has lots of goodies that look like they are on steroids.  The cinnamon bun is huge and could easily feed three to four people. 

Our waitress was friendly and prompt and everyone else in the restaurant looked like they were enjoying  the same level of service. 

While slightly pricier than other breakfast spots in the area, it isn't a smokey bar or a chain restaurant, which makes it appealing to me."}
{"text":"Overall the food is good nothing negative to say about the food but the service , jeez do they need help . This place is crowded and sometimes there's rarely any moving space but that's not my reason for the 3 starts the cashier was probably the rudest person I've ever had to encounter and trust me I've encountered some rude ones , but no hello or anything basically just stated the total and placed my change on the counter when I had my hand out passed me my food and started yelling for the next order . I feel like customer service is a huge part that contributes to a restaurant and if you have crappy service it doesn't make you want to go back no matter how good the food is . I doubt I'll be back to this place. I didn't catch the cashiers name but she had long dark hair I went in yesterday around 3:30 . The guy that initially helped me was nice but the last lady really ruined it for me ."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is such a treat! It's the Jewish deli that everyone wishes they had in their life! 

Pros:
The knish was delicious! And the hamantashens were better then my grandmothers.

Cons:
The dells lemonade was very bitter, and not as close to the original."}
{"text":"If you like pastrami and cornbeef sandwiches this is the place. How about bagels and lox? We have been going to Begel Cafe for over 10 years every weekend. A must try place in Las Vegas.

Bob"}
{"text":"The Bagel Cafe is really under rated. Reminds me of a New York deli, everything is extremely fresh the pastries are AMAZING. 

Price wise could be a little cheaper but if you want a good place to chill and watch Sports all day with some great munchies this is the spot!

Wish this place was outside the casino it would do really well on it's own"}
{"text":"My Jewish family and I loveeee The Bagel Cafe. We dine in occasionally, but usually get stuff to go. They have a huge assortment of bagels and cream cheeses, as well as deli salads, fish, cold cuts, and some amazing desserts for purchase. The bagels are my favorite. They are soft and baked in house with over a dozen flavors. They are extra delicious if you can get them fresh out of the oven. We usually get a baker's dozen, which is 13 bagels, and a flavored cream cheese, as well as egg and tuna salads. This makes for a yummy brunch. 

My last visit was on a Sunday around 1 and I was in and out quickly. You order at the deli counter, and then pay at the register. For a dozen bagels, 1 pound of lox cream cheese, a pound of tuna salad, and half a pound of egg salad I spent $40. A bit pricey, but definitely worth it. You get what you pay for, and you are paying for quality food. Whenever anyone suggests bagels, this is the place we always go to. 

I recommend not coming early on weekends if you can help it, because they are jam packed and there is always a line. They are open during the week until 8pm and until 5pm on weekends."}
{"text":"I'm done with this place. I've been here before several times and many times when I have guest visit me, I'll take them here or recommend people here. Today I arrived with family who are visiting us and decided to grab a bite to eat. It was 4:40pm and as we arrived, this  man (later found out is a manager) approached us and with a stern voice told us \" you have 5 min to order because the kitchen will close \". What kind of crap is that?! He was practically telling us to turn around and leave. Ive worked I this industry for many years and understand that the staff wants to go home, but you still should accommodate guests as best as you can. I've had way better customer service the times I've been here before. This town is growing, as far as places to eat. I'm taking my business elsewhere and will not recommend this place again. Like I said, many other places to go and eat."}
{"text":"Great food, mostly homemade however the service is terribly slow. When my food was delivered my drink was empty and it stayed that way till after I was done eating. Then when delivering the check she asked if I wanted a refill which I replied yes please but I didn't get that till 10 minutes later"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and each time the food and service has been outstanding. It's a seat yourself type of joint so be sure to get there before the breakfast or lunch rush; luckily each time I've gone, I've gotten a table. The food is the best deli food I've had in Vegas, period! The sandwiches are gigantic and the breakfast fare is bountiful. Each time I've been I've had a different type of sandwich. There are two sizes of sandwiches, the biggest size is huge, but manageable if you've got a descent appetite. All the spicy mustard they offer on the table goes great with any sandwich. My wife is a breakfast fanatic and each time we've gone she hasn't been disappointed. After our meals we take a stroll next to their dessert cases and after about 10 minutes or so we finally make our decisions. They have a huge selection of desserts that are made on site as well as their bagel selection. If you're looking for a legit deli, with huge sandwiches and tasty desserts, this is your place, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Bagels in Las vegas, mediocre service, but who cares?

Their Smoked salmon platter is my favorite, and their menu has so many diverse options like Challah french toast, whitefish spread, a sturgeon platter, a herring in wine sauce appetizer, and a delectable caviar cream cheese. 

I missed Russ & Daughters back in NYC a little less. Thanks Bagel Cafe."}
{"text":"Love the menu.  Everything is always good.  Great place to take friends and family from out of town.  Wish they had more kosher style options...really no turkey bacon or turkey sausage?"}
{"text":"We go here every year when we visit Vegas.  Never again. 

It's entirely possible our server was just awful however he took quite a long time to arrive to take our order, didn't return once for 15 minutes to refill drinks, etc (we had to leverage 2 other waitstaff).  Finally returned to deliver 1/2 of food to table.  10 minutes later we had to ask another server to find him for the rest of our food.  Our sever returns shortly thereafter with food, which isn't ours.  When confronted with the fact that he messed up the order he became enraged, left our table, threw the plate of food in the busser cart with a large crash and audibly announced to everyone that he would not return to our table...all because of his own mistake.  Good riddance to him.

Get new staff, you can't have an attitude like that when you work in the service industry."}
{"text":"Just average in my opinion. Waitress was friendly but not very attentive. They were out of half the stuff we asked for, even iced tea. Was reasonably priced and OK for average lunch or dinner. Not on my favorites list but I wouldn't say no to eating there again."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way to a local soccer tournament. 
Upon entering we found the establishment to be appealing and welcoming.  
The smells of fresh bagels cooking and the smiling greeting waitresses was a pleasant way to start a morning breakfast. 
Our service was prompt and friendly.  
We ordered the lox plate, fruit parfait, pancakes with bacon a plain bagel, and another plain bagel with cream cheese."}
{"text":"Best bagel place in vegas. It's always busy but there is an option to sit down or take out. Big section of bagels. Kind customer service. A little busy but still great. Food is amazing."}
{"text":"Best deli in Las Vegas but makes me miss LA and NY delis."}
{"text":"I have a confession to make... I have an obsession with tongue.

That's right folks - tongue. I love it. Name the animal - duck, pig, cow - it's definitely one of the best eating parts of the animal. (what, were thinking about something else? You guys have dirty minds ;P  !) Being Asian, my parents indoctrined this love at a very early age.

When I discovered that Jewish delis were into tongue too (and liver, yum!), I pretty much loved hitting up inexpensive places to nosh.

I was kind of depressed in Vegas because... well, on the Strip, you pass by all these famous delis that basically rape your wallet.

You can imagine how happy I was to find the Bagel Cafe! 

My hubby got the pastrami and I ordered the tongue sandwich. Perfection. Really. And not hard on the wallet either which is the best part.

I did try a slice of Boston Creme cake and it is totally junky good."}
{"text":"Recommended by my realtor, and I have to say it's spot on!! First off Megan is a rock star. She understands the difference between service and hospitality. I would be back just for the hospitality alone. Megan if you come to California I would love to have you on my team. Second that's the way corned beef Hash should be made. Among the best I've had in my 57 years. Can't wait to bring my wife and New Yorker father in law. They will absolutely  love it!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service we ordered a open face sandwich and they came over with a platter of food instead we sent it back and they refused to take it off our bill when we asked them too. They yelled at us for asking and also refused to let us talk to the manager.... all together worst experience I've ever had. I will not go back ever again!"}
{"text":"This joint is right by my house, so trying it was a no brainer. Going on a Saturday means it's busy busy for breakfast, but the wait is never more than 15 to 20 min. Mostly, it takes all of 5 min to get seated. I took my New Yorker friend who DIED over this place. It's the most authentic place she's found in Vegas. The food is tasty - I get the Western omelet with sausage instead of ham and the house potatoes. It's always more than enough food, so leftover lovers REJOICE! Each order comes with one of their bagels and cream cheese too. SO. MUCH. GOOD. FOOD. If you just want to pop in for a pastry, there is an entire counter of delicious goodies, too."}
{"text":"The best bakery in Plas Vegas by far can't wait to visit still recovering from surgery I'll be back as sooon as I can get there"}
{"text":"I have eaten in this place food is okay.  The cashiers never smile or say hi.  The desserts are fabulous.  Okay to visit once in awhile"}
{"text":"This is the best deli in all of Las Vegas. The cookies are always great."}
{"text":"The bagels here are much better than other bagel places in town.  Their creams cheeses are fresh with fresh fruit mixed in!  

Sit down service is up and down, inconsistent. It usually depends on how busy they are. They have the rule: You can't be seated unless your entire party is present, but that isn't consistent either. They will ask over and over about your stroller if you have one...where will you put it, can it be broken down for fear it will take up soooooo much space. During one visit the stroller issue was so bad they said it was a fire issue. I had to let them know that it would fold down smaller than most as it was a jogger stroller. So leave your stroller in the car to avoid snotty questions or if you dislike condescending tones. 

To be fair, some staff members are amazingly sweet. One person at the to go check out gave my baby his favorite cookie on the house and talked to him for a few minutes. 

We would frequent this establishment more if their staff were consistently kind and professional."}
{"text":"Amazing! Incredible staff, very attentive & friendly! Incredible value on the kids meal! Wonderful food! Bagels, French toast, smoked Lox eggs Benedict, crab cake eggs Benedict....oh my gosh!!! Great coffee-best in town for us!! Bakery goods are delicious! Homemade cream cheese spreads are unbeatable!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst delicatessen I have ever been to. Service was fine, but the food was another story. Was there Thursday night at 7:40 and ordered two corn beef sandwiches to go. They were almost inedible. They were so dry and corned beef had no flavor. I was embarrassed to tell my husband how much I paid. Have been to much better delicatessens."}
{"text":"They have the best French toast made with challah!  Good matzo ball soup and sandwiches.  Def as close to NY deli food as you can get in Vegas."}
{"text":"It been while since knocked off another bookmark. I finally got around to checking out The Bagel Cafe. I just happen to be in a bagel kind of mood start the day so figure perfect opportunity for some yelping. 

Talk about bagels, bagels, and not just bagels. I had no idea since this was my first visit. It felt like almost whole deli section in major chain grocery store. One section that has all kinds of bagels in wire baskets choose from everything and anything can imagine. Each basket is well label and LOVE the way all the sections are displayed for the customers. Clean glass display, clear easy to read labels, and everything looks fresh. The selection of cream cheese again just about had everything and everything can imagine. I ended up going on safer play sun dried tomato bagel with regular cream cheese. Toast the bagel coast you dollar extra find odd. It was awesome bagel. The cream cheese was solid. The veggie cream cheese was looking awesome just wanted stay neutral flavor and enjoy the bagel. In the same section had assortment of cold salads can choose from. On the right have deli section with cheeses, deli meats, and not often seen in deli sections had couple dried fish or smoked fish looked like could get. The dessert section!!!! The biggest section of all of them. Really nothing that I would not pass up to try. I was just in bagel kind of mood. 

The restaurant area itself is decent size with counter area. Looks and feel like local coffee shop decor. I just got bagel to go so have no idea about the service or anything about the restaurant. Not doubt if in breakfast mood The Bagel Cafe is solid choice start the day!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty bagels, sandwiches and desserts.  Kind of reminds me of Katz's Deli in NYC, except friendlier.  The bread is amazing.  The bagel sandwiches are huge.  Don't get the egg bagel sandwich for the road.  There is no way you can eat it without sitting down at a table, preferably with a knife and fork.  It's a monster.

The food can take some time but it is worth the wait.  But don't come here and expect to get out the door in five minutes.  If you dine in, they will not let you split a sandwich.  Also, ordering at the dessert counter can be a little frustrating.  We waited for some time and people cut in front of us before the guy behind the counter acknowledged us.  But a minor hiccup for great food."}
{"text":"This place apparently had some great sandwiches, but after seeing their breakfast menu, I couldn't resist the biscuits and gravy. They turned out excellent. The sausage left a little to be desired, but that's the only reason I'm giving it a four. Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here the morning of the 2nd for breakfast and I ordered a café mocha and the pastrami omelet with provolone, and my Mr. ordered the two egg breakfast with bacon.  I was really jonesing for this breakfast because I'd never been to a place that will put pastrami (and some of the other deli meats) in an omelet.  It just sounded good, you know?  

The omelet was great.  The pastrami was really tender and full of flavor.  My home fries were not warm and tasted like they had been sitting around for awhile.  Same goes for my husband's breakfast, which also had his eggs scrambled, not sunny side up.  He always orders sunny side up.  I didn't even notice because I was digging into my tasty pastrami.  He opted not to have it corrected and just helped me eat my omelet.  The mocha tasted like watery hot chocolate and was really disappointing at $4.50.  One of us ordered a chocolate chip bagel with regular cream cheese and the bagel was very nice and chewy.  Really enjoyed that even though there were no discernible chocolate chips in it.

Other than the omelet and the bagel, there's really nothing that was good about our breakfast.  The atmosphere was very noisy.  On one side I had a loud talker blaring in my ear his expertise about car tires, and on the other we had a little poopster who had probably just learned to pull herself up and stand and look around.  She also enjoyed pulling on my husband's shirt and ear.  Not cute or cool.  I wish the people who shot out that kid were paying a little more attention to her.  

I would go back again and try some of their other items.  Maybe it was just a bad day.  Our total after tax, before tip, was $31.08 and it was just not a good 30-dollar breakfast.  However, I trust my Yelp buddy, Loon E.'s opinion, so next time I'll have to try the whitefish salad.  Maybe that will elevate my next review."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for all the traditional Jewish Foods my grandma used to make for me. The Matzah Ball Soup truly is Jewish Penicillin when you are sick (and even if your not). And their Bagel, Lox, and Cream Cheese is complete with Capers,Tomatoes,and Red Onion! And their Bagel selections are complete with Bagels and Bialys( not sure if that's spelled correctly) Delicious!!
The bakery section is complete with everything your heart desires.
I love this place."}
{"text":"We've been coming here since we move back east in early 2000 iIt was recommended by some Jewish friends. The deli specially the pastrami is comparable back east. The taste, moistness is perfect. The matzo ball is also good. Another reason why we come was for their black and white cookies and Napoleon dessert it was really good. The reason why is only 3 stars... Their coffee is terrible. 1st time we went here years ago I hated their coffee, so we gave it a shot a couple years later.... The coffee still suck!! I investigated and peek at their coffee area nd they use this company farmers coffee. It was so watered down, so I don't come here for breakfast or lunch if I want good coffee or come here order water and head to Starbucks, coffee bean or any coffee house I feel that day"}
{"text":"Just because a place is popular doesn't mean it's good. The bagel cafe is a perfect example. This non-kosher and probably non-Jewish deli is a far cry from New York's Kosher delis. Noisy and messy with abrasive service (part of this place's \"charm\" perhaps?). Part restaurant, part deli/bakery. For Vegas it is an attraction but prices are insane. Every exta (e.g.  toast your bagel, add a slice of cheese, add a slice of tomato, avocado - all at least an extra $1 or more).  $2.5 for a mediocre hamantachen? Now that's Chutzpah."}
{"text":"This review is only for my latest purchase - a Pastrami $ Swiss on Rye. Over the years my experience here has been good, not so much this time. I ordered a Pastrami & Swiss on Rye to go and it was still warm when I got home. I unwrapped the sandwich and it was the same stuffed in the middle item that you would receive in any typical deli - meant to look as if it was really massive. To be expected. I put mustard on it and proceeded to take a bite. It was terribly dry and lacked the wonderful pastrami spice flavor that separates it from a corned beef sandwich. It tasted like the pastrami you can get at any Smith's deli - not REAL pastrami. I opened up the sandwich and noticed it had no fat at all. While excessive fat is a no no, no fat is just as bad. Fat is where a lot of flavor is. The sandwich was so dry that it sucked the moisture out of my mouth. They need to take a look at their purveyor to question the source of their pastrami. I would never purchase another one from The Bagel cafe. Try one and see if you don't agree - if you dare, (unless you are on a fat restricted diet). I really like this place and it distresses me to post this negative review."}
{"text":"Would be 4 stars if you didn't BURN MY BAGELS every time you toast them. Get a new toaster, please! We've been eating at The Bagel Cafe for 2 years now and have never had a non-burnt bagel served to us with our Matzo-ball soup. Love that you have Onion bagels, hate that all of the onion bits are burnt to carcinogen level 5 every time. I'm talking black as night. A tragedy. PLEASE invest in a new toaster, or turn it way down even though it might slow down your turn and burn... (pun intended)

Great Matzo-ball soup, though!"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite breakfast places.... I ordered the scrambled eggs, potatoes, and sausage with a chocolate chip bagel and cinnamon walnut raisin cream cheese, so basically I had enough food to feed a small village. Everything was delicious, and that was truly the best bagel & cream cheese I've ever had!  It tasted like it was fresh out of the oven... I'll be back on a regular basis that's for sure :)"}
{"text":"I wanted to be impressed but having eaten at Cantor's many a time this place leaves much to be desired.

Sandwiches (he had pastrami, and I had a brisket) were so so.... cucumber salad is okay but needs a little \"punch\" to it. Our other two companions were not entirely impressed except for her chicken salad. Now that was good.

Portions are huge.... but I would rather have a really good medium size meal than a less than stellar supersize.

Waitress was very friendly but got orders wrong. My jewish bubala would be turning in her grave!

Overall, stick with ordering fresh bagels and a shmear to go!"}
{"text":"The best bagel and veggie snear I've had. The bagel was light yet full of substance. This place is worth a 30min drive just for one bagel."}
{"text":"This guy is from queens and makes the best breakfast just like back home in NYC. Breakfast is from NY in LV"}
{"text":"This place had great service, warm atmosphere and a very large menu. The NT potato knish was probably the best thing we had there. We also both got the sandwiches, which were good but far too big to even hold. The french fries were crispy enough (just the way I like them) and their portions are pretty large. BUT I tried the pizza bagels and they were god awful. The marinara had a really bad, sour aftertaste and the cheese was congealed. So, that pretty much ruined my meal a bit for me although I'd still be willing to go back and try a couple of other things on the menu."}
{"text":"New York revisited!  Been going here for over 13 years.  A little piece of home with that real family owned feel.  Never had a bad meal in fact its always fabulous.  My favorite is the greek salad.  It beats any greek salad in this town for sure!"}
{"text":"Several years later, and I may have had a run-in or two with a waitress in a bad mood but I still suggest Bagel Cafe to all my bagel-loving friends! 

Nothing has changed here. It is still a hidden gem of Vegas with signage that is in no way loud. You enter straight into the deli portion where you can place to go order. Pass this and you can be seated. The seats are still awkward unless you are in a booth - but I am the person who always prefers a booth and I will wait. Over the years I have become increasingly impressed with their Hand Cut Nova 4oz. About $17 it comes with tomatoes, cucumbers, pickles, onions, capers, obviously Nova, and any bagel you like. I recommend it if you like this style of breakfast in general. 

I only have two complaints from my visits here. First, the orange juice does not taste \"fresh squeezed\" like they claim on the menu. It tastes watered down. If this is not the case the quality of the oranges must be severely lacking. Additionally, I don't like that you check out at the counter. This normally would not be an issue but it has happened before that after I ate I wanted a to-go order for my friend at home. The waitress said she could not take the order and to order at the register, and the register asked me to order in the deli line, which took ten more minutes than I would have been willing to spend had I known I had to start from scratch to order after I already ate. The deli line is always long, but they do impressively well at making it move."}
{"text":"Loosing favor...our first visit was excellent, food selection very nice and our order was prepared perfectly; i ordered baked salmon Benedict, Grace ordered Challah French toast.
Today's visit, at 1pm on a Tuesday, we ordered the same items, Grace's Challah French toast was such a large order, the 3 pieces of French toast could have each been a loaf of bread alone! 
My plate was not so good...the muffin was grilled instead of toasted as was the salmon, grilled instead of baked; both spent too much time on the grill and were 'hard-crusted' ..unappetizing. 
Finally, the salmon had an unusual amount of bones making me lose my appetite and my desire to have this plate again in the future..this was my third time having this plate as I really enjoyed its uniqueness. 
With the large selection, I'll find plenty of other dishes to try, but won't be ordering this Benedict again."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend for lunch. Service was quick and friendly. Food was excellent. I couldn't ask for a better experience. 

My lunch partner went on and on about the authenticity of the food. We walked through the deli side on the way out. I think there were 8 or 10 kinds of cream cheese.

I'll definitely return when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Ordered the chopped liver appetizer and my husband ordered the Rueben. Both were delicious and highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review due to the extremely RUDE manager on duty on Easter! 

I placed an order for pick up early on Sunday to have picked up at two. I ordered four meals and several pastries from the case. When I was checking out I mentioned that I was to get a side and bagel option with the Benedict I ordered, per their menu online(see picture). Two girls told me no before they asked the manager, Jeremy/Jerry. Who said no but go a head and give it to her, I said thank you. He proceeds to get a menu to point it out. I said ok just to let you know your menu online says that all eggs and omelet dishes come with a choice of sides stated and a bagel. (All in the same section of the Benedict's). He said it comes with an English muffin but I'm not going to make a big deal out of a bagel and that he's never had anyone ask for the bagel. I don't respond because I know better and he agreed to give me the bagel. But I think to myself well I understand that a Benedict comes with an English muffin, I'm not stupid but the menu didn't state a bagel for a substitute. The girl ringing me out said oh the online menu? Well what this guy doesn't know is that I've worked in and managed places very similar to this and I know when a cashier is sympathizing with a customer. They obviously have had this complaint before also by the way he immediately got defensive. 

So I pay $75 AND tip (not to mention the $8.25 for a \"large\" side of fruit that was a mere pint) and we leave. As were walking out the door I hear ma'am, like I've forgotten a bag. Ha nope! It's the manager coming outside to argue some more. (My BF said after we left that when he came out the manager said I didn't want to argue with you inside....uhhh how about not at all) He tries to speak but I say to the BF let's go and he starts going on and on and I walk around the BF to walk away and the manager says \"ridiculous\" as he's wailing back in. Ummmm NNO!!! I turn around, open the door and say that was uncalled for and walked away. He comes out again and says next time you can get a bagel instead of the English muffin. Well Manager of the Year, there won't be a next time!! 

Ok so! So many things wrong with this!! First of all a manager following me outside to argue with a customer!!! Outside!! Over a bagel!!! You seriously have nothing better to do? I never had time to do that when I was a manager nor was it something I wished to do and seek out. He was so mad about giving me a bagel he steamed over it and still felt he hadn't said enough! 

Second, let me inform some of you who might not know...those bagels you pay $2.00 and then some only cost about $.25 to make. Hmmm customer comes to my store spends $75, makes a valid point about what your crappy online menu says, give $.25 bagel to make customer happy. Most restaurant managers know the common sense in that! 

I seriously couldn't say enough about this! 
Uncalled for. Unprofessional. A frequent customer is now a nonexistent. I'm not happy about refusing to have their pastries!! But not worth giving any more of my money to them!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Bagel Cafe on a Saturday around 12pm, and there was about a 20 minute wait. I decided to take my order to go, which is convenient and super fast. I ordered a turkey pastrami sandwich on wheat with macaroni salad. While the man at the deli made my order, I browsed the dessert case. They have a wide selection of cookies and pastries, most of which are super sized. I decided on the chocolate cupcake, which looks like a jumbo version of a Hostess cupcake.

I am not a huge sandwich fan, but this one was pretty good. Fresh veggies, and a load of meat. Half of the sandwich was enough to fill me up, and I have a big appetite. The macaroni salad was actually pretty good too. The portion was tiny and it's a little sweet, but I'd get it again. The pickle - don't bother. It had the most odd taste, and it's more like a cucumber than a pickle. Thankfully, was free.

I was really excited about the cupcake, but sigh. The ganache on top is done really well. The cake, however, is incredibly dry. There isn't enough ganache or cream filling to save the cake. You'll need a glass a milk with this one.

I added a bag of chips and CJ's Italian ice to my order, and my total was a little more than $20. A little pricey, but the food was pretty good.

Overall, very good experience. I will check them out again."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from this place so I make it a point to try to come as much as I can. I absolutely LOVE it here. It's rather small, and it's best to come 1-4 people. It's loud and noisy also. The portions are big and the flavor is even bigger! I recommend the jalapeño cheese bagel with  regular cream cheese or the jalapeño cream cheese. Yummy with a spicy kick. All of their bagels and spreads are homemade too! They also serve breakfast, lunch, & I think dinner.  Their steak & egg breakfast is so yummy. As is their club sandwich. They also have a bakery section where they have all kinds of treats to choose from. Tiramisu, cookies, cakes, brownies, ginormous cinnamon rolls, muffins, pies, and lots of other things.

It's a very cute mom & pop setting with amazing food, service, and a great atmosphere. Not a good place if you want peace & quiet but it's a good place if you want a good hearty meal!"}
{"text":"I spent my formative culinary years in New York City.  I know a good bagel!  That doesn't make me Einstein, nor will we mention that name again in a review about bagels.  I am happy to say I have officially named The Bagel Cafe the second best bagel in Las Vegas.  You might think that is no big deal, but it took me more than 20 repeat visits to issue this award.   Now let's get on with the details.

The place is apparently owned by one of two brothers.  I heard the other brother owns the bagel place at Suncoast.  I also heard they don't get along.  It's just a rumor...  but an interesting one.  The bagels here are nearly perfect.  A certain hardness is required on the outside to match a chewy inner bagel.  They come real close to New York perfection here.  They have all the required varieties, and appropriate toppings.  Whitefish salad to Cream Cheese and Salmon they have it all and it's tasty.  The service is typical New York style.  No warm friendly teenagers who want you to know their name here.  More like veteran deli personnel who are bored stiff with your order.   That is not a complaint, by the way.  I love it all.  I feel like I am down on East 14th street all over again.  

The food comes quickly with no fanfare.  The plates and trimmings are all deli standard.  The restaurat is clean and even the bathrooms aren't awful, though the line can get out of hand and make things unpleasant.  If you on weekends, plan to wait in line.  If you are a fan of NY deli... plan to spend some $ after the meal in their deli.  Grab some lox and bagels to go.  I'd even pick up a bag of Wise chips for lunch tomorrow.  (The plain Wise chips still make me salivate at the thought of opening the bag).  Very reasonable pricing so it won't break the bank.  Parking is tight so leave the SUV at home... please.  

Overall, a great bagel experience with all the trimmings.  So are you wondering where the best bagel in Las Vegas can be found?  Well, I might let you know one day soon.  For now I will keep the lines there short and just give you one hint.  The guy that owns the best NY bagel place in Las Vegas... possible the best on the West Coast.... isn't from NY.  He's from Chicago.  Say it aint so....."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the whole vibe of this place! I didn't have to wait for a server to take my order which is always a plus. The portions were huge! I got the lemon pepper turkey bacon on a sourdough bagel which was great. Only thing is it had no mayonnaise which i guess many people don't like i just thought it was weird that it originally didn't come with it. Any way the experience was great food was great price was good. Will definitely be coming here again and recommended to my co workers as well."}
{"text":"I have been to The Bagel Cafe quite a few times. I've been there for breakfast and dinner. But mostly I go there to pick up a bagel and cream cheese. My favorite is the jalapeño cheddar bagel with jalapeño cheddar cream cheese. I usually get that and then one other bagel cream cheese combo and split them with my wife. I really like their bagels and they have a very good selection of homemade cream cheese. Their other food is good too."}
{"text":"I have wanted very much to come here, as they were touted on their bagels and Jewish deli-ness. I was pleased that it was more spacious than I expected, with tables and a counter for seating. The bagel selection was good and the pastries looked wonderful. But I was here for a favorite--bagel, schmear, and lox. The first annoyance was the lack of a \"please seat yourself sign\", but that was minor. The next annoyance was that there was no bagel-shmear-lox item on the menu. I had to order a bagel and a small Nova platter. The waitress was good in asking if I wanted capers, as of course I did. The bagel did come with an adequate amount of schmear; I often have to ask for more but here I didn't. The small Nova platter was a major disappointment. There were a lot of greens (more than I needed of lettuce, tomato slices, cucumber slices, and a half a pickle) but an insignificant amount of lox. The good delis I know in Cleveland and New York would have been ashamed. I am sure that much else is good, but this is not."}
{"text":"The best Jewish deli outside of NYC! Bagels are always fresh, the array of schmears makes it difficult to decide on one or two, which results in gluttonous shopping experience...
The rugelachs are buttery and flaky. My favorite is apricot raisin. 
Their matzo ball soup is filled lots of chicken, delicious large matzo balls that looks, smells and tastes like what Bubbie used to make! 
The kids love their black and white cookies, the chocolate mousse cake is delightful!"}
{"text":"Service: 5 Stars 

The place was full and we were seated after 30 seconds and had our drink order taken and had our drinks within 2 minutes. I didn't time it was just noticeably fast ! 
Our server was very nice. 


Food quality: 5 Stars 
There food has always been good when I came. Everything seems to be very fresh. I generally order the nova lox. For lunch I order a pastrami. This place has that New York Bagel Deli vibe. 

Parking/location: 1 Star 

Beware this place has the worst parking ratio ever, and people don't know how to park so when there is a space chances are you won't be able to park there so just be patient people. Lol


Presentation: 4 Stars 
I'd prefer my food to be prepared for me rather than them bring out the Nova lox platter for me to make my own bagel. Or at least provide the option."}
{"text":"I came here for a late brunch and we just missed the rush! We were seated right away and greeted with service the moment we sat at our table with menus. (I love breakfast places that have newspapers as their menu!) They have different types of bagels! I wanted the sun-dried tomato bagel, but they ran out. I ended up ordering garlic and onion one and it was okay. I also ordered the lox & bagel. That was delicious! I love smoked salmon and it came with a lot of olives and other condiments, but not enough salmon! Its a very cute breakfast joint, but I wasn't impressed. They do have a lot of desserts, breads, and other pastries! They look better than the food. I want to come back just to try their desserts!"}
{"text":"Something has changed at the Bagel Cafe and it is not good!
All new faces jerry the manager and most of the old staff is gone 
Waited 45mins to get seated when they had empty tables 
Owner walks around in a daze doesn't know what's going on 
Maybe time to retire 
Got seated and waited another 10 mins b-4 any one came by 
Won't be coming back here any time soon 
Use to be a great place sorry to see it go down like this 
Time to fine a new deli"}
{"text":"Best Sicilian omelet I've ever had, so fresh and amazing!!!! The bakery is off the chart!!!!! The sandwiches are unreal!!! And the chicken noodle soup is the BEST soup I've EVER had, especially with a hangover!!"}
{"text":"I recently dined at the Bagel Cafe and I was so surprised at the authenticity of the food offered.  I am from the East Coast and the offering made me feel so at home! Kishka, Salami and other 'old style' food I had in Canada was fantastic.  The bakery was also top notch."}
{"text":"First time in, great bagel! They get one star because employees rude and unprofessional."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. They have organic eggs and coffee :) the staff is wonderful and highly attentive. Great asset to the las vegas community."}
{"text":"The closest you'll get to New York deli in Las Vegas by far. Large selection of bakery items and bagels in addition to the restaurant. We came for lunch and I had the roast beef dip with matzo ball chicken soup, both of which were fantastic. Only giving three stars due to the wait in getting our food (a little slow for lunch, it gets pretty crowded) and I felt like prices were just slightly north of what I'd prefer. Otherwise, another great off-Strip hidden gem in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Jewish delis in town.

There bagels are better than the chain bagel shops in Vegas, they have a wonderful variety of bagels and cream cheeses, and they do some wonderful Jewish classics as well.

One of their most popular items is their matzo ball soup.  I am absolutely a fan!  Theirs is a classic version that highlights the matzo ball...oddly enough.

I used to live down the street from Bagel Cafe.  I ended up rotating through a series of breakfast bagel sandwiches, but one of my favorite is still over-easy egg, ham, and provolone on an everything bagel.  They have such solid ham for a Jewish Deli!

This is a place I want to go to with grandmotherly woman and enjoy some wonderful conversation over breakfast."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this AM and it was very crowded. Never had a bad meal in this place. A little pricey but all good delis are.
Bagels are made correctly, boiled and baked. Great assortment of flavored cream cheese and s bakery to die  we will be going back often when I get a craving for a good, big bagel"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic breakfast and lunch place.  It also has a great deli counter.  When living in Vegas, we eat here at least twice a week.  The only reason I don't give it five stars is the owner's attitude toward mistakes from the kitchen.  He isn't  really concerned about it, but mistakes happen so seldom that it doesn't matter too much.  A must visit regardless of whether you live in Vegas or are just visiting.  GET OFF THE STRIP occasionally..."}
{"text":"I love their Matzo ball soup and their chicken salad. The best combo in the world is the Matzo ball soup with a 1/2 chicken salad on an everything bagel. They actually give you the entire bagel with a \"smaller\" portion of chicken salad. But, the portion is not small. I can eat one half with my soup and enjoy the other later.

I love the butter cookies and the chocolate rugula from the deli. I usually get these to go and enjoy these at home.

The counter is unfriendly though. I always feel rushed and have to put on my big girl pants to get my order. I don't understand why it has to be this way. The waitresses are friendly. But, I guess they have to go with the rude deli to make it feel authentic."}
{"text":"Had the bacon omelet bacon in Every bite cooked to perfection, with a toasted blue berry bagel and plain cream cheese, pastrami sandwich, eggs Benedict were amazing!! Everything is super delicious. The staff was really friendly and quick with service. Also, stopped at the bakery to grab some cookies super delicious! Will be going back to try their lunch and dinner food items."}
{"text":"The lox and cream cheese is the best I have ever had. The dessert case looked great but I was too full to partake. The restaurant was really busy is you can tell it is enjoyed by a lot of people. The bagels were fresh."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I take my sister to Fyzical Therapy in the mornings and I was starving! It was first time here and they girl at the front was very helpful. The ordering area is a little confusing but everyone is willing to help you along. My sister wanted a bagel and I wanted eggs. I ordered a cheese and sausage omelette. It can with potatoes (they call them homemade fries) and a bagel. It only cost $13 for both of us to eat and the portions are perfect. My only suggestion would be to made add some seasoning to the eggs and put the cheese in the omelet. Other than that it was perfect!"}
{"text":"Amazing every single time. I've been coming here for years with my grandma and they never disappoint. Their bagels & bakery are amazing! My go to is the sourdough bagel with garlic cheddar cream cheese & the mini eclair. My grandma love the olive pimento cream cheese with the spinach bagel & the almond cookies. My husband gets the breakfast bagels and says they are always amazing!! Seriously it's worth the wait here!!!! Obsessed!"}
{"text":"I have been a \"customer\" of bagel cafe for many years. The word customer is in quotes because I never feel like a customer, but rather a burden to everyone.  I always get orders to go, and the guys behind the counter simply aren't friendly, and the girls at the cashier are equally drab and uninviting.

Funny thing about Jewish deli's....it's the one type of restaurant that I'm willing to tolerate attitude from the servers and staff, that sort of New York attitude where they might seem to be rude but really aren't, it's just their style.  And the reason most tolerate it also is because the food is so good it doesn't matter.

However, this isn't the case here. The staff has a terrible unfriendly attitude, and guess what...the food is NOT in fact good enough to justify it. This is no Nate n Al's, or Brent's, two outstanding LA favorites.  This place is marginal at best, and it's amazing to me they are the only deli on the entire West side. Now, maybe Cantor's will change things, but from what I hear of their prices, probably not.

So for now I remain a sad deli fan, sad that the only semi reasonably priced deli anywhere near me treats me like an unwelcome stranger, and in exchange I get food that the people in LA, not to mention NYC, would laugh at."}
{"text":"Unspectacular breakfast and lunch place. The bagels are larger and chewier at Smith's, and half the price of Bagel Cafe.

I tried their french toast. Just basic, and kinda disappointing because I'd heard good things about this place from friends. Save yourself a couple bucks and get a Grand Slam. 

Nothing to write home about, and for breakfast, the Sunshine Cafe on Decatur and Washington has cozier ambiance, and much yummier food."}
{"text":"Wow what a disappointment. Haven't been here in 4 years ( due to moving actress town )  and the whole experience was SAD! 

1- Cold food 
2- Kyle our server was very overwhelmed ( ask for help dude!! ) 

For the price of the meal and the sad experience. It'll be a long time until we return."}
{"text":"The service here is genuine. We loved the variety. There is definitely food options here food any kind of foodies. There's lots of table space compared to many bagel places I have been to. The coffee was flavorfully bold. I had the nova lox Benedict which was the best I've ever had. I'm very much looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I just had a good laugh at Misti and Bobby's reviews... the bagel burning and Bobby writing in all caps is too funny.  Okay that's off my chest... now to the review

I kinda really like this place!  That pastrami sandwich, my god I love it.  Even the pickle it is served with is fantastic.  

Corned beef hash... homemade, also fantastic.  I would know which one to pick from if I was here alone.  Corned beef hash and eggs or pastrami sandwich, very difficult decision.

I don't know if I'm being cheap, but the restaurant is a little pricey.  It's like 8 bucks for a cup of soup?  I'm not sure about that, and it says you can't share sandwiches on the menu, I'm not sure if I like that idea either.

Anyway, this place is great, I don't mind spending a couple of extra dollars and having a great meal, I'm excited about bringing my parents here, it's nice to know places like this exist in Vegas."}
{"text":"Potato Knisch! (Make sure you get the Gulden spicy mustard)
Bagels and cream cheese! 
And the most phenomenal bakery case full of gigantic pastries. My goodness! 
This is my go to bakery and Knisch place."}
{"text":"We've eaten at the Bagel Cafe many times and have came to the following conclusion; the experience is truly an adventure. You have no idea whether your meal will be good or bad. My squeeze ordered corned beef hash and eggs. What she got was some peculiar tasting cold corned beef mixture. I ordered chopped liver on a bialy with a slice of onion. I got chopped liver on an onion bagel. Servers that we knew were missing; strangers were in there place. What happened? When we were checking out the cashier asked \" How was your meal\". Our answer was awful. Her response was \"That's too bad\". That's too bad!! Forgot to mention that this happened on a Saturday at 1:00 pm. In the past we always had to wait for a table at this hour; today we were told to choose any table and there were at least 6 tables available. What happened. What happened?"}
{"text":"This is a family favorite! We came on a Sunday morning & I thought it would be PACKED as it usually is but luckily we were seated right away. Favorites are brisket, fruit cups, bagels (duh) & matzoh ball soup. I'd skip the potato pancakes, they are so thick & never seem to be cooked through enough. Black & white cookies are a staple that you must try!"}
{"text":"The lox platter with the works was amazing. The waitress was very prompt and pleasant, over bagel crisp and a dab of cream cheese while I waited for my food. Everything was off the chart. Brought extra napkins with meal, bonus, as eating a tower of cream cheese, tomato, onion, cucumber, capers and thinly slice lox (perfect) can be messy at times. The servers and bussers were around often to refill my coffee mug. Made me feel like I was on the East Coast at a NY Deli. I put the address on my phone screen to press and get me there, as I am new to Las Vegas. Still learning to get around.
I can't wait until I try their sandwiches. They looked awesome at the table next to mine. Best of luck, you have a great product. Got some pastry to go on Saturday back to eat on Tuesday."}
{"text":"I started this review with 4 stars, then changed my mind because I have nothing at all bad to say. Nothing but above average on all levels from service, to quality, selection, and price. I've dined here about 3 times and have stopped in for a bagel or dessert as well. (Jalapeño bagel with jalapeño cheddar cream cheese toasted) And you really can't go wrong with any pastry or dessert. To be honest I've never left without one or four regardless if I dine in. Fav menu selections include: chicken pot pie, crab cake Benedict, and the chicken salad sandwich. Someone in my party had the smoked salmon and it was also great. Grabbed a strawberry rhubarb pie for thanksgiving, again everyone approved. It gets pretty busy, but the staff is on it. If you need something from the deli remember to speak up! This IS an east coast Jewish style place remember. The guys behind the counter are beyond helpful. Bottom line, I'd your in the area, check this place out for lunch or breakfast!"}
{"text":"Today I tried the everything bagel and the jalapeño bagel tried them with the veggie cream cheese but it tastes a lot of just onion... by far I think the everything bagel is better. With that purchase I got elephant ear bread I love it. Kind of hard to catch the workers attention though but would love to go again to try more things"}
{"text":"I've heard from a lot of NY transplants that The Bagel Cafe is the closest they've gotten to an authentic bagel in Las Vegas so I obviously had to try it.... And I wasn't disappointed! I love the cafe atmosphere and there is such a huge selection of food, and also love the quick counter to grab and go. The 4 stars is for their prices... I think it's a little high for some of their plates but I do agree that the quality is worth it."}
{"text":"Wow!! I'm not an avid reviewer but this place definitely deserved taking the time to write one! 
My experience started with their bagel breakfast sandwich which was the ABSOLUTE BEST breakfast sandwich I've ever had...and I LOVE breakfast sandwiches!

The bagels and speciality cream cheese are perfect as well! 

This is def going to be a frequent stop for me! Very happy I found it!"}
{"text":"Didn't feel like the bagels were much like NYC style...bagels were large which is great for quantity purposes but isn't like actual NYC bagels which are smaller

Had the knockwurst and I'm pretty sure that it wasn't knockwurst...the sausage I ate had a dark brown color while knockwurst is lighter in color....regardless of how u cook it...the sausage was an overpriced country sausage that u get cheaper at ihop"}
{"text":"I decide to go in for breakfast today. And it was the best choice ever! Everyone was nice and polite. I got the Pastrami omelette. With and Egg Bagel and garlic cheddar cream cheese. For the price that I payed. It was worth every penny for sure. I'm definitely coming back with friends and family."}
{"text":"OMG best sandwiches in town !!! love the New York style coffee style."}
{"text":"It's the only Jewish deli in town.  If you miss a New York bagel, this is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"The crab cakes are the best I have ever had! This is a great place I highly suggest breakfast!"}
{"text":"As an ex-NYer, I have a pretty high standard of bagel. These did not disappoint, but I wouldn't say they are truly singular in their yumminess. My review is based solely on these, as we did not try the desserts or anything else. Some of the bagels seemed \"fresher\" than others, and if you've ever had a NYC bagel before 8am, you know the expectations I have. I also feel like the bagels were kinda skinny, and the holes were big. I'm used to really fat, chewy but pillowy ones. Sigh.

But it really pains me to give anything lower than 4 stars, as they have a lot of traditional Jewish/NYC deli delicacies, which you really don't see out here in LV. If that is your thing, you really should check it out! The rye bread with caraway seeds looked good. The dessert section also piqued my interest. Please don't get a black & white cookie - Hell will freeze over before anyone ever likes those, trust me.

The shop is located in the weirdest shopping complex - it feels like a dr's office belongs here. Inside, it was pretty poppin' (it was Sunday), but the line wasn't bad. 

All in all, I will be back again to try more."}
{"text":"YUM!  Great bagels and great breakfast.  A little pricey for breakfast and the owner guy is a bit of a condescending jerk.  If we didn't like the food so much I don't think we would be back because of him.  Overall the food is quality and the waitresses are friendly."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and the portions are huge, it's close to my house and it's never a let down.  The only reason why it didn't give 5 stars is because the service always feels rushed. I get that  they have a line of people waiting all the time (that's a great thing) but every time I come I'm still either taking a last bite out of my sandwich and I still have a piece in my hand and they are trying to clear the plate or dropping the check halfway through the meal.  I get that they don't want people hanging out for a long time but I would like to enjoy the delicious food they put out.  

Don't forget to stop at the Togo counter and take home some goodies for later."}
{"text":"Went there today for the first time and probably had the worst service I've had in a while. We sat down for 20 minutes and no one ever took our order or even approached our table and the restaurant wasn't busy. We got up to do take out because we were so frustrated and that took another 10 minutes because of the lack of organization in the back and we were 3rd in line. Not impressed. Don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"First time I came in and I am amazed I have not stopped by since I have lived here for 15 years.  I stopped for quick breakfast snack to keep me energized for my day. Had a bagel and egg and cheddar sandwich. House made bagel was very satisfying.  The counter staff was friendly and helpful during this visit. 

What gets me excited to come back for another visit was the pastry case.  OMG! The desserts looked decadent and crafted with skill. I cannot wait to stop by just for dessert..... And the one of their pastrami sandwiches stacked to the ceiling."}
{"text":"Lox me up and throw away the key!

This Jewish deli is a local's paradise. Come here to get your bagel and lox fix, you will not regret it. 2 oz smoked fish  of your choice, we chose (nova), a bagel of your choice for $11.95. My fiancé and I chose the everything bagel with scallion cream cheese and nova lox since it's less saltier than the belly lox. Very fresh and meaty smoked salmon with just the right saltiness. It comes as a platter with red onion, tomatoes, lettuce, cucumber and some olives. I loved the cream cheese, it tasted freshly made plus they don't skimp. Of course the bagel was the star of the show. The everything bagel was super plump and airy with the right amount of crisped edges. Flavor rating: 5/5

We also tried the belly lox but we felt that the saltiness was a little bit too much for us. Flavor rating: 3/5

We also ordered a bagel sandwich: jalapeño cheddar bagel with pepper jack cheese, scrambled egg, and bacon for $6. Super simple but the fresh bagel really shines and made everything come together for the perfect bite. The jalapeño and cheddar flavor were equally weak, however the texture of the bagel was great. Flavor rating: 3/5

And for the road we ordered a raisin bagel with cinnamon raisin walnut cream cheese $3.50. They hook it up with the cream cheese so that there is enough to spread equally onto the giant plump bagels. I really loved the cinnamon walnut cream cheese! It's sweet and creamy and went well with the raisin bagel. Flavor rating: 5/5

This place is quite the spot to be at during breakfast and brunch hours so be prepared for a hectic environment. The service is a bit scattered and we were a little bummed that the hostess was clueless on the menu when we asked her a few questions (What was Nova? What are the popular items on the menu?) Hopefully they will have their staff trained up and as enthusiastic about the menu as we are!"}
{"text":"The service was good, not great.  A very busy place and I'm not sure why?  The bagels are good.  I ordered the corned beef sandwich, I left most of it on the plate, it was so fatty I couldn't eat it and it definitely wasn't worth the money. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great NY style deli.  We always order the fish platter (lox and whitefish) and they have a wide selection of homemade bagels and spreads.  A bit pricey but tastes darn good.  They also have great lunch food like matzo ball soup and overstuffed deli sandwiches and beautiful desserts!"}
{"text":"The salmon plate is perfection! Second visit, with the same order. There smoked salmon is soo good! I would also recommend their potato pancakes! The lattes are great as well!"}
{"text":"Why do your bagels taste so good???? Ugh pool seaon is right around the corner and here we are putting away the Carbs.  Oh well extra time at the gym!  Of course they have the most amazing desert selection.... Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"I stopped in just to see if they had pumpkin bagels and to my sweet surprise -- yes they do!  They are amazing, just the right amount of cinnamon and nutmeg so yummy!  I also got a few pieces of the apple rugala - soo good! The pastry reminds me of baklava filo dough -- nice, light and flaky!  Check out their fall treats!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and its always been good breakfast and lunch food. However my last visit, the food wasn't that good. I ordered a knish with matzo ball soup. The soup, as always was delicious. The matzo ball was pillowey goodness. Unfortunately the knish was a different story. I ordered the one with meat. I cut into the top, unfortunately I couldn't cut all the way through because the bottom was rock hard. Almost as though it had spent too much time in the microwave to heat up. The meat was also very dry. Our waitress was awesome, I showed it to her and she ask if she could replace it for me. I said sure, I'll try the potato pancake. Again, it was overcooked. Very chewy... it did have great flavor. I love supporting local, so I will definitely be back However I may just stick to the bagels. They're always good!"}
{"text":"First time in Vegas and really glad I came! Great breakfast if you're on this side of town"}
{"text":"It has been years since I have had access to a bagel shop. When I was in Miami, I lived next to a great Jewish Bagel shop that made great bagel sandwiches that I would hit up all the time. But after moving to WV, I learned to make my own bagels, which were good but not quite up to par with the pros yet.

So seeing this place so close to home was nice. I stopped in for a bagel sandwich but didn't realize how big and happening this place was on a Sunday afternoon. Fortunately, everyone was waiting for a table for Brunch, so I was able to make an order for take out right away at the deli. 

The deli is packed with all sorts of goodies that send my mind into a diabetic coma. Chocolate fudge cake, black forest cake, NY cheesecake, Babka, rugelach, all forms of cookies, bagels, cream cheeses and deli meats. My mouth watered just thinking about it. :)

I ordered a toasted poppy seed bagel with eggs, cheddar cheese, and pastrami - plus a slice of chocolate fudge cake. One thing I figured out was they go big here. The slice of cake felt more like the whole cake, and the bagel was very big - I like that a lot.

Once I got home and digged into it, I was pretty pleased with it. Bagel was nicely toasted, and made for a good sandwich. The chocolate fudge cake is everything you would expect it to be - chocolaty and fudgy, lol. It is very large, and could easily have been cut into 3 slices that each would have been considered big. 

While it is not quite as good as my old place, it is good enough to warrant me coming back. :)"}
{"text":"This deli is where I first discovered the famed black and white cookie. My life has really never been the same since, truth be known.

Last year, when I went home for Christmas, my mom took me here with a large amount of gift certificates and encouraged me to select whatever I wanted. Thus, I have tried almost everything the deli has to offer, and it's all good. Seriously. From tuna salad to bagels to pastries, Las Vegas has a really great East Coast style deli and this is it."}
{"text":"The closest thing you will find to a real New York Style Deli in all of Las Vegas! This place reminds me so much of places I used to frequent on the East Coast. Pastrami Sandwiches, matzo ball soup, bagels and schmear...the list goes on. Black and white cookies are legit. Their pastry case is to die for! I could just stand there all friggin day. Bagel Cafe, I am happy I found you amongst these fake New York style delis in Vegas that serve mediocre food for way to much money! See you soon"}
{"text":"My friends and I stumbled upon this place while trying to eat outside of the strip! Thanks to the YELP APP that helped us discover this AWESOME place!!! We all LOVED it here!!! 

It seems like a family owned place and the service does NOT get ANY BETTER than it does here! Everyone was SOOO incredibly friendly and why are the portions so freaking huge?! Oh, I'm sorry, did that sound like I was complaining--cause I SURE WASN'T!! I had the crab cake eggs benedict--HELLO AMAZING! Combine things I love, eggs, bread, hollandaise sauce, and *drum rolllll* CRAB CAKES--I AM SOLD! I also tried their Spinach Feta bagel with the jalapeno cheddar cream cheese---I thought I was in HEAVEN! Seriously their food is delicious! Huge portions, great prices, and AMAZING service! Their hours are a little odd, but they're in the middle of what looks like a business/corporate area so I assume they're usually open to accomodate the surrounding businesses/offices. 

Friends got a variety of sandwiches boy were they HUGE! 

I think we'll be coming back here the next time we're in Vegas and want to eat off the strip. Plus they're Bakery/Deli area is AMAZING! I'm TOTALLY getting something the next time I come here!"}
{"text":"Probably the best bagel place in town! Old-school, NY feel with authentic menu items. The variety is great, but make sure you get here early as the more popular bagels will sell out later in the day. The nova lox cream cheese, black-and-white cookie and Matzo ball soup are definite must-try items."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is good but the service can be spotty. I've been here several times and I just can't place what it is. It's not that they don't care, it's that everyone is running around frantically. You almost have to flag them down so that they slow down and listen to you. It can be a bit frustrating, especially at checkout when you haven't a clue where to stand and they keep helping the people at the bakery/deli counter. Just speak up and say \"Hey I need to pay!\""}
{"text":"Great place, sometimes think they need more seating and some healthier options, hence the missing star. 
They are the only ones with spinach knish, not just potato. The matzah ball soup is great! And fresh bagels are great. Best place for brunch meals to go.  too bad it isn't more convenient for me!"}
{"text":"My wife and I try to come here once a week. They have great traditional food and amazing pastries. I love thier fresh made cream cheese with awesome flavors, however I usually end up getting the same thing every time. Everything bagel with real nova lox cream cheese. Ive also had the matzo ball soup which is very good."}
{"text":"The food was great no denying that. I'm trying to cut down on my salt intake so when I order the matzoh ball soup I asked for a cup of hot water, yea, well I got the water and when I received the bill later they had charged me $1.00....for a hot cut of water. Thought that was pretty ridiculous, but hey took it off of the bill for so I guess that was nice. 
*woof*"}
{"text":"Love this place!

I don't eat breakfast often, but when I do, I prefer The Bagel Cafe. Stay hungry my friends.

Seriously though, this place has the dopest bagels and pastries. The best part about it? They don't taste overly sugary! I could literally eat a cookie, a black coffee and a jalapeno and cheese bagel every day. 

The ONLY reason this place gets knocked off of the perfect 5 stars is because of service at the cashier. Just because it is a New York-style eatery, does not mean you can treat your customers like they're Bostonians. The cashier was pretty rude when I was taking out my money to pay as if I should've already had it out and ready...really?

Anyways, if you don't mind the people when you eat somewhere, definitely come here! If you do mind service, STILL come here, but bite your tongue when speaking to the cashier."}
{"text":"my son stopped by the other day and brought me a black and white cookie.. it was devine. But I knew that because Talia is the best baker and cake decorator there. I will be coming in soon... I need another cookie...


ok....went for lunch...had a half turkey sandwich and OMG they have COKE love it. Hubby had a brisket sandwich and loved it... we bought so many desserts. ok first of all, the turnovers have to be at least 12-15 inches long... huge... bought a apple one a cherry one, we also bought a chocolate cream filled cupcake which my husband wolfed down, lol... I got 2 butter cookies with sprinkles, a black and white cookie, and 2 wedding cookies... mmmmm I had to use my food saver to keep them fresh because with donuts and sweets from Bagel Café. my waistband might pop.. lol"}
{"text":"It's a busy place.  Get seated as soon as you can.  Love the newspaper style menu and the waitress was friendly, helpful since it was my first time there.  Lots of breakfast choices  depending on how hungry you are - servings are definitely huge you can probably share it with another!  Limited parking tho - it's located in a business center in a busy intersection. I only had fruit that morning mainly because I was still recovering from a tattoo session -  tho it was carb heaven with lots of bagel choices, egg omelette of every kind.  Next time you are up for a huge, satisfy the craving breakfast after a great workout or cheat meal that's the place to be!"}
{"text":"Service and sandwiches were terrific. I love the Pastrami Reuben with col slaw replacing the sauerkraut. Messy but wonderful. Sandwiches are definitely large enough to share."}
{"text":"It's hard to find decent deli anywhere anymore even Las Vegas The Bagel Cafe is very decent."}
{"text":"This place has all the good NYC hometown foods!  Being a native NY-er & currently living on the west coast, I miss my hometown foods!  This place has bagels made like In NYC.  They have the shiny outside & the chewy texture like in NY bagels.  Cream cheese is deli-whipped.  They offer lox, pastrami, corned beef, knishes, a variety of deli meats, & a large bakery section.  We found NY-style cheesecake, Black & White cookies, rainbow cookies & a selection of Wise-brand snacks.  They offer a lot more than what I can write.  Ate there for lunch & everything was delicious!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great bagels, great service, great price! I always get some fresh butter cookies to go because they are so yummy. This is a staple for locals so it's no wonder why it's voted \"The Best of Las Vegas\" year after year."}
{"text":"Caveat Emptor...let the buyer beware! We have been going here for the last few years and have seen a steady decline in customer service. We come from Arizona and purchased a few gift cards, which they told us we couldn't use because their system was down. Sounds bogus and supposedly the gift card system will be back up on Tuesday 10/14? I wonder...how do they know that? It's fishy to me. Not to mention the so-called host Jerry started screaming at me. Just amazed that these places get too big for their britches. By the way the food is on the downturn too, unfortunately. Bottom line: take care of the customer! They seem to have forgotten that."}
{"text":"I desperately want to like the Bagel Cafe more than 3 stars. I like bagels, I like cafes. Hence perfect match, right? The only think is that I cannot find anything I like beyond the bagels and pastries.

We used to go to the Bagel Cafe every weekend cause it was down the street from my bf's old domicile. I don't know if I am being fussy but I just don't like their omelettes or eggs for that matter. The eggs are always a bit overcooked for me and I really don't like their assembly. The omelette has a slice of cheese slapped on top. And since I am not a fan of bell peppers I do not like their seasoned potatoes. And it seems like every time I go their bacon is undercooked.

So the things I have liked so far are, of course, their bagels. My personal favorite is the sesame, my bf usually likes the asiago. The garlic cheddar cream cheese is good but it is so strong that after a while it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. I also like the cheese blintzes, they are very large and full of sweet cheese. Tthe potato pancakes are pretty good as well.

Edit: for clarity"}
{"text":"I got half dozen bagels, 2- 1/4 lb of cream cheese and 1/2 lb of lox to go, it cost $35.00! It is way over priced. I did not even get an itemized receipt. I could have been over charged for all I know. I was shocked. Their bagels are just as good as Einsteins. The customer service is poor. The cashier and the food helper never smiled or expressed gratuity for coming in."}
{"text":"I finally stopped in after passing it on the road many times. Since it's The Bagel Cafe, it would have been a shame not to order something without a bagel. I decided on the Bagel and Lox platter and I was not disappointed. It came with tomatoes, onions, olives, cucumbers, pickles, and of course lox. Combined with my Everything Bagel, there was plenty of food to make me full. It was all quality ingredients, good food, and served by a friendly staff! I also bought some cookies on my way out, which I also enjoyed. I'm hoping to make it back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Almost 4 years we've been coming to this place. it's still as awesome as ever. The consistent quality is a major plus. I have never had a bad order. Their lox spread reminds me of home...NYC. Their olive spread beasts anything I've tried. Let's put it this way...They could compete with any bagel shop in NY off they relocated there. But pricing of course would have to change on their menu items. That's the premium we pay for living 2500 miles away. 
They have amazing fruit plates, amazing...no, beyond amazing lobster salad (the shrimp salad was good but nothing ridiculous), and my go to standard when dining in is the lox platter...oh, I'm kvelling."}
{"text":"Poor service on a Wednesday not busy at all everyone before us got their food way before we even ordered 20 minutes after we got there we got our order taken."}
{"text":"Walk in to Bagel Cafe on a weekend and it's a madhouse. There are long lines to order from their deli and bakery, long lines to be seated, and a dining room packed to the gills. When you do finally get seated you'll find a large menu full of fairly inexpensive items and portion sizes that beg to be shared. Challah French toast consisted of about four thick, egg-drenched slices. A pretty good version, for sure, but one that was too hefty for one person to finish. On my way out I grabbed a chocolate fudge cake that was too sugary sweet, a creamy plain cheesecake that was light and airy, and a huge M&M cookie for my kid which he quickly devoured.

3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"Most disappointing experience ever. 3 of our party of 5 ordered biscuits and gravy which should be an easy meal. Instead when one of our members dipped his bacon into the gravy, he brought up the bacon and there was long strands of hair in the gravy. The waitress was immediately notified and she did promptly take away his plate. The remaining plates were no longer touched and asked to be removed as well. The general manager then came over and stated that the hair was not blended in the gravy and he didn't see the problem!!! Unacceptable!!! Never will I step foot in these doors again and will make sure not to refer anyone here. The manager needs basic customer service training and our waitress needs to not roll her eyes and both need basic manners."}
{"text":"I been coming her since 1995 when they first open and it seems to only get better. Fresh selection of soups, sandwich meats and best bagels in town. Bakery is amazing too."}
{"text":"Good bagels, wish they had pork roll though, if your from Nyc or NJ you get that pork roll is LIFE! Honestly the food is very over priced in my opinion, but it's good and let's face it, where else do we have to go in Vegas besides here for bagels that are good ! I do love the matzo ball soup! 

The only negative , as to why they only get three stars is the customer service! It needs improvement, as I've been there many times and always feel it's lacking! The last visit my boyfriend ordered take out, two soups, and some bagels! Sadly when we got home , we noticed our pricey chicken noddle soup had zero chicken and hardly anything but broth, clearly we were unhappy but whatever we'll just call up and get reimbursed which who really cares, we go there often so even a note on the account for next time works. Well that didn't happen, the manager told us to keep one, and bring it back so we can see before they close, umm we live on the other side of town! That's all they could do in order to give us a new soup? Who seriously  wanted to drive all the way back when we drove 30 minutes just for the soup! 

***So basically if they mess up any take out order, remember to keep the food and drive back and show them since they can't just leave a note for the next time! Seriously guys?**"}
{"text":"OMG! I. Forgot to mention their French fries! I think they are double fried or something because it was a pile of salty extra crispy goodness."}
{"text":"This place gets crowded. Waited 20 min for a table at 12:30pm during the lunch rush. it clears out after 1:30pm, no waiting after the lunch rush. The portions are HUGE here with the typical Deli style sandwiches and bagels.  The bakery has great items too."}
{"text":"MAJOR FAIL.  Went to grab some food at the deli. Drove all they way there gave my order which the main reason was for soup with matzo balls.  Get all the way back home and found the screwed my order.  
So if there is a next time I go grab takeout and you are behind me don't get nuts while I stop and go through the whole order piece by piece. Last time I leave a big top too guys"}
{"text":"The omelet I received was not what I ordered.  I told the waiter and he offered to correct it, but we had already waited a good 15 minutes for our food to arrive, and I declined his offer as my boyfriend's food had arrived and we were hoping to eat together, as most people do when they go out.  We then realized my boyfriend never received the bread he requested -twice!  We asked the waiter again, but no bread.

Realizing our bad experience, the waiter offered to \"comp\" my omelet.  We waited, waited, waited, and then the mean manager sat at our table and started an argument about not wanting to \"comp\" food that was consumed.  When I pointed out the reason why I didn't want to wait ANOTHER 15 minutes for a correct order, and that my boyfriend never received his bread, being the reasons the waiter wanted to \"comp\" my meal.  

Manager ended up arguing with us, at which point we stood up and left.  We never asked for a \"comp\", it was offered to us by the waiter and yanked away by a grumpy manager."}
{"text":"Yummy matzoh ball soup served with your choice of bagel. I get mine with a jalapeño & cheese bagel and a coke. Great flavor combo. This place is popular with the jewish locals so it has to be good. More than decent portions. You can make 4 sandwiches from the meat in just one of their deli sandwiches. They renovated the interior so it looks cleaner and less divey than before.

I like perusing their pastry shelves after a meal. Some desserts are hit or miss but you can't go wrong with some chocolate covered strawberries and marshmallow twists."}
{"text":"Best Bagel of 2016!  Not even close, this place is #1.

I am obsessed with bagels.  When I am preparing for a trip anywhere, one of the first things I do is try to figure out where I'm going to get my morning bagel fix.  I don't eat bagels everyday, but I need to know where to score if I need a hit.

A toasted Everything bagel with a nice schmear of regular cream cheese and a cafe latte is just about my all time favorite on-the-go breakfast.  No breakfast burritos for me, thank you very much.  

The Everything bagels here are the best I've had all year.  Absolutely delicious and wonderfully chewy, they are as good as it gets.  

While they clearly know how to make bagels here, toasting them is another thing.  The seeds and other toppings on the top of the bagel were burnt.  Under the cream cheese, the inside of the bagel didn't appear to be toasted at all.  Should be the other way around, minus the burnt.

It was still delicious a delicious bagel, so I'm not deducting any stars. But it sure would be nice if they could address the toasting issue.  At home it's just a matter of switching the setting on the toaster oven from Toast to Broil: the insides get toasted and the seeds/nuts/onions don't turn an unappetizing black.  Surely there's got to be a way a restaurant can toast their bagels without burning the toppings.

The cafe latte here was also excellent, even though it was served at about 1,500 degrees F.  Watch out, McDonald's!

Parking is a huge issue here.  There are some 10-15 minute parking places right next to the restaurant, and if you are taking your order to go , that's fine.  If you are planning on sitting down, you're going to have to scramble for a parking place in the medical center's very crowded private parking lot.

This place is totally legit!  I'm definitely looking forward to trying some of the other things on the menu.  

Mikey C says: thank you, Yelp friends!  thank you, Bagel Cafe!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and if it weren't for the consistently inconsistent service and the fact they really aren't kid friendly they would have got a solid 5 stars from me!  This will probably be our last time coming here, but I would consider this a great place to get food to go like your typical bagel / deli back east."}
{"text":"I love love love this place :-) when Im sick I crave their chicken mazto ball and noodle soup :-) their bagels are great and you gotta pick up a black and white cookie while your there :-) i love their friendly New Yorker attitudes too. It does get busy here but i think its worth it. Try going during the week if you dont like real large crowds. Another thing is they have a $10 min to use your credit or debit card. I actaully came in at $9 and was going to add more to my bill since i didn't have cash on me but the girl smiled and said it was ok. I know it doesn't sound like much but i have been in places where they did make me buy extra when i was a dollar off, these small things don't go un-noticed with me :-)"}
{"text":"Good portions and good food! If I lived in Las Vegas, I would definitely be a regular. I had corn beef, home fries, and eggs. My wife had French Toast which was GREAT! I would absolutely order the French toast again! My son had a massive Ruben sandwich. Prices were fair. Our service was a little slow but very friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Boyfriend had corned beef sandwich with potato salad. $13. I had corned beef hash with eggs and a bagel. $12. Ginormous cinnamon roll. $3. Hair boyfriend found in rye bread .... Free. 

After boyfriend found a long hair inside the bread I lost my appetite. He didn't let me say anything but it was so disgusting. Needless to say I was disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the years and I really like the balance of healthy and unhealthy options. The servers are always friendly too and we get seated quickly every time. The most recent time I visited, I got an everything bagel with 2 eggs, bacon, cheddar cheese and avocado. Living in NYC, BEC on a bagel or roll is a typical breakfast here and since the cafe is NYC themed, I figured I couldn't go wrong with that. I found it odd that the server asked how I wanted my eggs since usually they're just served in a patty like form (perfect for eating on the go) in NY. I said over medium was fine. When it was brought to the table, I was surprised that it was served open face. I guess this is so I could add any condiments I wanted to it..? Eating it was a bit messy since the eggs were runny (probably not a good choice; I should choose hard next time). That being said, it was delicious and very satisfying. I also had a mimosa which was delicious and some coffee after that. I redeemed the check-in offer for a free cookie which was really yummy and hit the spot after my meal. I always enjoy my meals here and it's a great choice for brunch; they just need to perfect the art of bagel sandwiches :)"}
{"text":"I can't believe the Bagel Cafe charges $1.00 for hot water, are  you kidding me. Get lost. I'll never go back there"}
{"text":"Bagel Cafe has the the best bagels in Vegas! Their pancakes and omelettes are on point.  They are always busy, but their service never falters. Their staff is very friendly and helpful. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Listen up bagel (and dessert) lovers, this review is for you. I was visiting Vegas and came here with a friend who loves the place. We ended up coming 2, almost 3, mornings in a row because it was SO GOOD. 

When we first walked in, my eye was instantly drawn to the massive selection of desserts they have. I'm talking cookies, cupcakes, napoleons, eclairs the size of your face, and more. I wanted it all. Next to that was the bagel selection - there must have been somewhere close to 17 different bagels to choose from, along with a great variety of cream cheese. Too cool. We waited ~10 minutes to be seated and were quickly served water and day old bagel crisps with a sample of their newest cream cheese flavor. 

The menu is a little intimidating because it's large and there are many delicious items to choose from. I went for the egg sandwich with avocado on a garlic bagel and it was excellent and super affordable - plus, the side of avocado was basically a whole half of an avocado! The second day I got the same, but went for cheese instead avo (both cost extra) and I got it on the asiago bagel, which I preferred to the garlic. I must say, despite how good the bagels were, the star of this restaurant was the yogurt parfait - it arrived in a huge bowl with so much fruit, my jaw dropped - strawberry, raspberry, mango, bananas, kiwi, and more (see photo). Just wow. For dessert we had chocolate rugulah and it was perfection. 

Great service and amazing food. Do yourself a favor and visit this Bagel Cafe!"}
{"text":"The Bagels are good.  I used to eat here often but it seems they have gone down hill since my last visit.  Eggs were \"weird\" Pancakes \"soso\"  Butter, jelly and syrup are all served in small togo type plastic single serve containers.  Service is good.  But didn't care for my meal more than once."}
{"text":"You must get a bagel! The cream cheese is fluffy and perfect! The jalepeno cream cheese is to die for! Everything tastes home made and great! Very attentive staff!"}
{"text":"I have been buying bagels for my office from The Bagel Cafe for 2 years now. Always the freshest bagels and smear. However, this past weekend decided to have breakfast there. My husband and I each ordered an omelet. His was a Salmon Omelet and mine was a Mushroom and cheese Omelet. The time it took to get our order placed and brought in was about 30mins and this was when they weren't very busy at all. The waitress was not very responsive and when the food finally arrived she brought me a Sausage and Cheese omelet and immediately walked away from the table as soon as I noticed the error. It took 5 minutes for her to return and she already knew the error because she picked up the plate before I even started explaining. Within 5 minutes she returned with the correct order and apologized. The food was average. Would I go there again for breakfast dine in? Nope. I think Denny's and IHOP got a better deal and better menu for that. 
Only thing I would highly recommend is there bagels, smear and pastries."}
{"text":"I can't get tired of their delicious food and great customer service, I usually go for breakfast, they have fresh bagels and pastries everyday."}
{"text":"I LOVE the bagels here! I haven't actually sat down for a meal but anything I have ordered to go has always been great :)"}
{"text":"My daughter and I had lunch the chicken noodle soup and matzo ball soup which were both very good potato pancake was really good and split corn beef sandwich was awesome I really wanted give give a 5 star but I can not cause our service was not so good but food 5 service 2"}
{"text":"Real authentic east coast style deli/restaurant! The bagels are the best and I treat my self and the wife occasionally to a bacon,egg and cheese bagel for breakfast to go.  What more can you want? The lunches are great and the bakery is probably the best in Vegas. Check it out- you can go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Best deli in town. Portions are huge but it pays to get a whole sandwich and take half home for left overs. Whether you pick corned beef or chopped liver, you won't be disappointed. The food is great! Most patrons are regulars and there is a friendly vibe going on."}
{"text":"Huge portions, fair prices and a wrap around case of baked goods means a very happy Yelper!  After going to Weiss a few months ago, my friends said \"you need to try Bagel Cafe, it's the best Jewish deli around\"!

Bagel Cafe has a very home-like feel to it and the menu is printed on a multi-page newspaper.  I went with a half-chicken salad sandwich that was still a decent size.  I kept eying my friend's large 1/2 sandwich he ordered which was loaded with meat and I don't think cost more than $15.

For dessert I went for their smaller sized cookie (the large is gigantic) but there is a whole slew of things to pick from at the entrance!!  Don't take my word for it though, billionaire Venetian owner Sheldon Adelson was at the table behind us!  I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast lunch or dinner.  Bring you appetite because they have large portions of great food."}
{"text":"The food here is great.  The service has been slow every time we come.  Last time we were seated 20 minutes before the waitress even acknowledged us.  This place is too big and too  busy for only two waitresses at dinner time.  We will keep coming for the Pastrami, Brisket and Black and Whites but we would come more often if the service was faster."}
{"text":"If you are a sandwich lover, welcome home. 
I'm not a sandwich lover, and they've made a believer out of me. I was running late and asked my friends to surprise order for me, and I ended up with a huge Reuben. No regrets! Best Reuben I've ever had and on beautiful, buttery bread! 

My friends had soups and sandwiches with bagels, but there's nothing wimpy about these soups and sandwiches. These are still meals that Nordic Vikings would be happy coming to after a bender of pillaging and conquering.

I've had their bagels before, and I don't think they are particularly extraordinary, but that's just me. Pastry cabinets here are full of very rustic pastries that didn't appeal to me much, but it's been working out for them! Something for everyone at The Bagel Cafe!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Soup, sandwiches, bagels, who could ask for anything more? Their pastries are yummy, but a little expensive."}
{"text":"Have been here many times and it is usually very good.  It has a New York feel but sometimes some of the staff have a New York attitude which is not acceptable in Las Vegas.  This time I went with some friends and ordered a chicken salad sandwich and found it to be tasteless.  They do have great bagels which I buy and bring home.  They are so thick I cut them in thirds, two ends and a middle and freeze them.  This way if I want a sandwich I use the two ends and if I just want bagel with eggs, etc I toast the middle.  They do have the best chicken matzoh ball and noodle soup.  Often I buy something from the bakery for my husband and they are all good.  He likes the muffins and I like the vanilla crumb cake."}
{"text":"All the food portions are giant and every ingredient is delicious! I love this place. 

Definitely the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had! And I love the sprinkle butter cookies. :)"}
{"text":"When I heard about this place, I had one question - are the bagels any good.  The answer is yes.

Now, nothing beats a proper NYC bagel, but these are as close as you are going to get in Vegas.They have a MASSIVE selection of cream cheeses with which to dress your bagel, and lots of toppings to select as well.  The holy grail of bagels is the Everything, and mine was done right.  The seed and spice mixture was in perfect proportions, and they held to the bagel with aplomb.

I also found their black & white cookie to be spot on - a light and moderately lemony cake with delicate vanilla and chocolate fondant.  I'd go back just for that.

The staff seemed a bit overwhelmed or perhaps bored while I was there, and I wasn't blown away by the service, but I will be back regardless to try breakfast in the dining room."}
{"text":"This place is a great getaway from the usual breakfast and lunch restaurants, providing a wonderful deli/bakery counter that has great buys.  Everything is good here.  I tried their pastries, cookies, breads, and their bagels--of course.  What I love are the shmears that they make.  We had the caviar one and OH MAN was it good!

If you're looking for a great bakery and deli, come here.  They sell things you probably won't find anywhere else."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place while on a drive one day. It is a cute cafe, with huge display cases full of any type of sweet you can imagine, all look home made. They also have the biggest variety of bagels and cream cheese i have ever seen. 

I sat down, menus are pretty cute, they are newspapers. The food was out of this world! Everything was fresh and I enjoyed every bit of breakfast. I had the white fish salad and an egg, sausage, tomato bagel.

I didn't give it five stars because of the service. They were quick to put my order in and i did receive my food not shortly after. However the waitress was overwhelmed with tables to get me my check. That part took almost twenty minutes. The staff does all help each other out and work together, which you don't see many places. I recommend going, just not when you are in a giant rush."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sat mid morning. Place was jammin and had about a 20 minute wait. 

Once we sat down, the drink server was right there to take our order. Food server was right behind her to take our order. 

Our food was delivered in a timely manner and was delicious- eggs Benedict and a nova and onion omelette ( no cheese). The home fries that came with the meal were wonderful. And they have fresh squeezed OJ!!!!

Oh and the bagels were amazing as well!!!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"New York Style Deli's are a touchy subject with me.  When done right, they are like staring into the face of God and having him smile back you and say \"You are my most precious creation\" but when done wrong, they make me sadder than Pauly Shore's acting career.  The Bagel is in the former category and can easily lay claim to best delicatessen in Las Vegas.

Judge a Jewish deli by five things:  The rye bread, the pastrami, the knish, the sweet & sour cabbage soup and if they sell the black & white cookie.  Alright, that last one might be homage to Seinfeld, but the other 4 will definitely tell you if a Deli is worth it's salt.  The Bagel has them down.  First, the rye bread is fresh and the perfect consistency.  Its got a nice crust and the heels are a perfect complement to any of their soups or sandwiches.  Speaking of soups, their sweet & sour cabbage soup is dynamite.  Chocked full of cabbage and with a simple beef bouillon to absorb the flavors, its a nice lunch on a cold day...to remind you of back home in Jersey.  The pastrami is like butter and practically melts in your mouth and if you want to get fancy, upgrade to a Reuben.  Finally the Knish....where do I began?  You are so good, I'm officially declaring myself on \"a gravy train with knish wheels.\"  

So you're probably wondering why no five stars?  Well, the Bagel is excellent but I cant dis the original gangsta deli's like Brent's in LA, Manny's in Chicago or Katz's in New York by putting it on the same level so consider the Bagel 4 1/2 stars as it pays homage to the grand masters.  For Las Vegas however, you can't do any better.  

Ohhh, and you're probably wondering why I never even brought up their namesake as well.  Bagels here are good, but bagels are bagels.  They do have an impressive selection and to go is available if you're not dining in.  They also have a bakery that would make my Bubby declare this place \"Meshugganah!\" the portions are so large...."}
{"text":"You've never had a French dip sandwich until you've had one made with brisket at the Bagel  Café ... Probably one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The beef is tender, juicy and is piled high on a delicious crispy roll.   Maureen  had a pastrami sandwich on rye and  she absolutely devoured it. Both sandwiches were huge but we couldn't stop eating them. Suzy had her favorite, the stuffed cabbage. She loves this one and it too was huge.  
Sides of potato salad and coleslaw were excellent. Can't say enough about this place I wish it was closer to where we live in Henderson. Too far to make the trip more than once every couple months but we look forward to it."}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating here since the restaurant opened and have enjoyed the food. We hail from New York and felt at home here, even meeting weekly to catch up. But last week after my aunt ordered a cup of matzo ball soup with the matzo ball on the side we had a serious problem. When the soup was brought to us, the cup of soup was half full. We asked for more soup. We, after all, were paying $1 extra to have the matzo ball on the side.  We were told it was a measured amount....that's how they do it. Except it's not and we know because like I said, we've been regulars for YEARS. We asked for the manager who, instead of offering more soup, tried to justify the half cup of broth. So, it would seem that a few cents of broth was worth losing regular customers who have been loyal for almost 2 decades. All we wanted was a cup of soup! They were unwilling to budge and have lost our business."}
{"text":"I've literally been coming since I was a kid, same exact place with some incredible pastries and bagels!! FYI - it does get hectic on weekend mornings & one cashier could smile more but still it's all about the food!"}
{"text":"Great service, always busy place, but the bagels are too heavy and too much dough. Some people may like it but for those who are on a diet, I have doubts you can lose weight, especially taking 14 bagels for a dozen, which is a great deal. Nice personal, everything would be OK, if these guys would make them less heavy. Maybe I should specially order them, because they do  taste great."}
{"text":"Place smells good I reccomend the snickers coffee drink it's like a frappuccino. Had the corn hash it was mediocre."}
{"text":"Bagels are amazing and fruit platter is so fresh! I will definitely be coming back here. I really felt like I walked into a diner in NYC. I lived in NYC for 3 years and it made me miss it so much! The service we encountered was fine, despite some of the other reviews and everyone was very helpful and patient with my mom and I as we decided on which yummy pastries to get. I can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Always good food old style deli.  Enormous bakery goods! Friendly staff. Busy on Sunday"}
{"text":"Mega cool place. It's close to my house but somehow I never try it. On the outside looks like after church hub. Wrong big time. 
NY style type of breakfast place. Variety of food. Everything! I have many fav things now. It's a must go place !"}
{"text":"Stopped in here today, after telling my dad I was getting a little tired of eating cereal for my b-fast and was thinking of bagels. Usually I go to Costco and pick up their bagels, but my dad ever the bagel fiend, went online and hunted for a bagel bakery. Lo and behold - Bagel Cafe! So I googled it up, and looked at the Bagel choices - YUUUUMMMINESS! There are 22 varieties - japeno cheddar, asiago, spinach and feta, sourdough, the everything bagel! Ok mouth is watering now. You can call your take out order in, and have it ready for you even! So I picked out my bagel choices and handed my dad the list to walk in and get, and figured on a 10 minute wait or so. Two minutes later he's walking back out bagels in hand! So have to give mad props for prompt customer service! Will have to wait another time to eat out, but will definitely come back this way."}
{"text":"Soup and sandwich is the best way to go b/c I'm always torn which way to go.  

Go with the matzo ball soup with either a Pastrami/Brisket/Corn Beef/Tongue. Sometimes I'll mix it up with the Lox and Bagle, which is scurmdiliumcious.  Honestly you can't go wrong with any sandwich.  For a hearty appetite, go for the 1/2 lb sandwich and soup.  You won't be dissapointed. 

Save your appetite to take home some bagels, cookies, and cake.  

Whenever I hit up this spot, i feel like I'm chillen with my J-Crew at the JCC - holla"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast joint in Vegas! Fresh bagels, awesome omelettes, freshest fruit cups,  delicious corn beef hash, eggs Benedict that will blow your mind, and the most amazing variety of pastries you'll ever see. 

I love that there is a also counter service: super fast, no nonsense, good stuff."}
{"text":"I love this place and I am sad that I don't get to have lunch here as often as I used to. This place reminds me of the Canters in LA, especially their deli and bakery.  They have a great menu. My favorites are the pastrami/corn beef sandwich, spanakopita (spinach pie) and matzoball soup. YUM!"}
{"text":"a little pricey but the food is authentic east coast all the way
from the bagels to the corned beef, you feel like you are in a east coast deli
they also make amazing pastries etc.
probably the best bagels in vegas!!"}
{"text":"Went here the other day with my family and grandparents. I needed to find a Deli style coffee shop type atmosphere to please my 80 year old grandparents who were visiting for a few days. My grandparents are Polish and Irish but this Jewish Style Bakery/Deli was right up there alley. My Grandpa and I ordered the appetizer size stuffed cabbage because for about $8.00-$9.00 my gramps had a hunch it was a pretty big portion. He was right! It came with rye bread as well. I'm sure the normal portion would be huge for the $12.00-13.00 range. We were very happy with the taste and I was also informed you can get the sauce on the side if you want to add to your desired liking. Another family member enjoyed the Pastrami sandwich which I am looking forward to trying soon.

With a few more great meals in the future at this place, I will have to elevate my rating to the 5 Star level. 4 for now until I'm wowed a few more times!"}
{"text":"Oh my god, how I MISS The Bagel Cafe! My fiance and I moved to paradise, excuse me, North County San Diego, two years ago from Las Vegas, and we don't often miss it there. But I still think about The Bagel Cafe and I get super peanut-butter-and-jealous when I see my friends check in there on Facebook. 

If you're wondering what's good here, the answer is everything, seriously. The best part of coming here is buying deli stuff on the way out. My fiance was obsessed with the pumpkin cream cheese for awhile, and I liked bringing the deli tuna home and eating that for a few days. It kept fresh for awhile and it is the best tuna I've ever had. Nothing else compares. Obviously their bagels are the best. You cannot beat them. Also, I have to mention my family is Jewish and I hardcore judge any Jewish deli's chicken soup and matzo balls. Theirs doesn't beat my mom's, but it comes damn close. It beats mine, as hard as that is for me to admit! Plus when you order a soup, you get a bagel! My fiance loved their eggs and sausage specials and he'd try a different bagel/cream cheese combo with it every time we came. I'm a huge fan of ALL of their desserts too. They have a ton to choose from. It's been awhile so I can't remember specifically, but we'd always leave with a few and there were never any leftovers past the first day!

On top of the food being delicious, the service was always on point. Even when my brother and I took our mom there for Mother's Day and they were super busy, the service was great and quick.

My fiance and I still have not found a deli in San Diego to compare to the Bagel Cafe. Next time I visit, that's the first place I'll be hitting up!"}
{"text":"Saying this place has the best bagel I have ever eaten is true, although I am prone to hyperbole, IT IS COMPLETELY TRUE!!! Oh my goodness, the salads are also darn good, but it may b e that anything you eat with these bagels will taste yummy.  Goodness, they are really Tasty. 
Darn, now I want one... or six."}
{"text":"They have the best bagels in Vegas! It reminds me of NY bagels and deli! Love this place!"}
{"text":"No smiles from any staff member at the counter. Seemed bothered to have any customers. Grumpy atmosphere. Slow service. Took nearly 20 minutes to get a to-go order that was supposed to have already been ready."}
{"text":"Ordered from Uber Eats. I had the biscuit and gravy. It was great. The gravy had a bit of a kick to it and the sausage was good as well. I would recommend the biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this deli!  I have never had a bad meal here and actually get cravings for their hot pastrami sandwich with swiss cheese, cole slaw, and Russian dressing....oh, dear, feel another craving coming on!  See you this weekend!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to me, and I am so glad she did. Being from NY I really have missed the cafes and bakery options. This one is a Jewish cafe with plenty of Jewish food, but there's also lots of NY inspired options as well as typical cafe American fare. The latkes are amazing and probably the best place in LV to get them. Pizza bagels are a New Yorkers dream. But the standout item at this place are the HALF MOON COOKIES. I know, I know. They call them black and white cookies anywhere outside NY. Seriously, you need them in your life."}
{"text":"What's a good way to start Saturday Morning in Las Vegas....Bagels and Starbucks! 

The breakfast bagels came with cream cheese and we probably got about a dozen bagels. The bagels were tasty, definitely a little hard on the outside but still good. 

Got the bagels and headed to the Starbucks drive though :)"}
{"text":"I had a disappointing experience here.  I like the unpretentious (if downscale), neighborhood feel of the place.  But other than that, Bagel Cafe has little going for it. The bagels are not that great--I'd take Einstein Bagels any day over bagels from this place.  And the service is not particularly pleasant.  But the worst thing was that I walked in for the first time and ordered a bagel and cup of tea from the counter.  Being my first time I didn't realize there was table service.  But despite half the tables being open, the wait staff refused to let me sit at a table and enjoy my bagel and tea.  They were more concerned about \"policy\" than letting a new customer enjoy himself in their establishment.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I use to seriously love this place, being from Jersey but I went yesterday with my two friends and have a horrible experience. I don't even know where to start, we had more than three different servers none of them even said hello or introduced themselves. We literally ordered french toast, eggs, bacon, and toast. Approximately an hour later the food arrives, there is a HAIR on the plate with the eggs. The server takes the eggs and then five minutes later comes back out with new eggs minus the hair. Great.. so when we got the bill of course the eggs were still on there even tho we had waited almost an hour for the food and when we got it there was a hair. I gave my card to make the payment not even looking at the bill (which was my fault) and when they brought it back i took a look and of couse with my luck they charged me $4 for bagels we didnt even order!! The manager said there was nothing he could do we could pick a pastry we should have reviewed the bill before paying. SMH great service, thanks for the hair! Wont be returning here ever again!!"}
{"text":"We are 1st timers here at the bagel cafe, great 1st impression I must say! Hugo was our server on this busy St. Patrick's day. He could tell I was slightly disappointed that they don't have green beer but he made it happen for meHe brought me my green beer and made my day. Brunch was delicious, atmosphere was busy but survivable, and desserts were AMAZING! Thanks Hugo for an amazing experience :)"}
{"text":"The Bagel Café is as good as it looks! This is my husband and my favorite breakfast/brunch place to eat! Everything is so delicious! They have the most amazing homemade bagels! My favorite on the menu is the combo/reuben sandwich! Its so huge and delicious!!"}
{"text":"They have the best bagels. I really mean this,  you can not get the same bagels in California."}
{"text":"Always wonderful food and service at The Bagel Cafe.  It's a convenient spot for breakfast/lunch with engaging always nice wait staff.  Love their chicken soup and really, their bagels are the best outside of NY!"}
{"text":"The food was okay. Nothing special. Very pricey. On top of that they gave us a moldy orange. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Everything is good everytime you go. A bit pricey at times, but plentiful and worth wvery bite."}
{"text":"Since my office recently moved near here, we are often here!  Whether its the amazing salads, omelettes or delectable desert, they never disappoint! Great food and great service - love the Bagel Cafe!"}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you- the restaurant has way more than just bagels. When you walk in you're greeted by an extensive dessert display (it all looks so good). The food menu has even more choices. The service is great and the food is delicious. The prices are relatively cheap for the generous portion sizes. Every time I've visited it's been packed which is a testament to how great the food is. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"In summary The Bagel Cafe = Large portions. 
This is a great place for breakfast or lunch. The atmosphere is comfortable and the staff is busy but try to be attentive. The restaurant is usually  full and parking in the private lot is tight. 
It's hard to pick a favorite but the eggs and corned beef hash is excellent. A large portion of hash with your style of eggs, choice of bagel and fruit or cottage cheese. You can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches for lunch, large enough to take some home."}
{"text":"Sugar intake portion control?  Fuhgeddabouditt!  No hope for that here.  You'd need to install a deterent magnet on yourself (like they have on some shopping carts) to stop you from entering this cafe.  

True story: A piece of Black Forest Cake lasted me 5 days. I ate it every morning for breakfast with plain coffee. Kept it in the fridge in the box, covered by a plastic bag with a loosely tied knot. Works perfectly to keep the cake moist. Really good cake, not too sweet; but again it's sugar.

Tried knish for the first time. My best description is they look like food stuffed donuts with a thinner dryer dough. Favored the spinach stuffed one much better. I find it heavy, so eating half made me full. I liked it!

But guess what? You know how you go to the store to get one thing and end up with more than you intended? It may happen to you at this cafe. It totally happened to me, dang. I only meant to try their cannolis. Then I saw the humongous black and white cookie, tiramisu, all sorts of cakes... 

Weaknesses. Easily hypnotized by no effort."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. Love the bagels and everything they offer to put on them. Their bagels are the best in Nevada and the closest you will find to a NY bagel (Harrie's Bagelmania is a contender too!) The homemade soups are great. You will never leave hungry because they serve very large portions! Breakfast is great too. After a sit down meal we  always buy bagels to go as well as items from their bakery which makes my bill quite hefty (this place is quite expensive). BUT lately I have been leaving this place quite annoyed because of the crappie service and all the employees seem very miserable and it's starting to get on my nerves."}
{"text":"On my Trip to Vegas, we ate at this amazing Deli w/my Mom & Jim. This place is a Goldmine! A TRUE Jewish Deli! I wish Phoenix had a Deli like this one! Their Matzoh Ball Soup is to die for!  I want to go to this deli every time I visit Vegas! ....Please open a location, here in Phoenix!!... We NEEDa you guys here, too! ...You would be a TOTAL HIT here!  :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding!  
Have nothing to add, everything has been said by all the previous insightful posters.
Sorry I cheated on you by trying the worst bakery I have ever had. Carlos (Cake Boss) at the Venetian."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Las Vegas from Connecticut  and have been missing a really good bagel. The bagels there remind me of the ones I used to get back home. Their breakfasts are delicious including their very tasty coffee. And if an amazing  breakfast isn't enough for you, visit their bakery full of freshly made sweets of all kinds!"}
{"text":"I've heard so many things about this place that we just HAD to try it!  It was also second on our list of places to go when Baby Cakes Cafe had an over 45 minute wait. 

First, parking seems to be at a premium at this location.  Good luck finding parking.  

Second, it  took us about 5 minutes to be acknowledged / seated.  They were busy but it was acceptable.  What stood out to me here was how irritated the older folks behind me were getting.

Third, the service - like I said it was busy. Extremely busy.  We did get our drink orders in and our actual orders in quickly after we put our menus down.

Fourth, the food!  The food came out after a 15 minute wait.  My wife ordered the multi-grain pancakes which were HUGE!  I ordered the colorado Omlet with a Raisin Bagel w/ Raisin Cream Cheese.  

My wife's multi-grain pancakes smelled AWESOME!  They even tasted very good.  ;)

My Colorado omelet, which consisted of Bell Peppers, Cheese and ham was just \"meh.\"  It was dry and kind of cold by the time I got it.  Nothing to write home about.  What did redeem the meal was the bagel.  Very good!

Over all, the place was clean, the staff was busy but still friendly.  I would come here again to try something else.  It'd have to be after breakfast was over though!"}
{"text":"Whyyyyyy has it taken me so long to go here ?! Fabulous NY style deli and bagels . Casual atmosphere , great food , what more can I say ?"}
{"text":"Best bagels, breakfast, Nova, corned beef and pastrami sandwiches, and desserts. Everything is home made and pure yummy. Eaten here for years and by far the best quality, quantity, and bang for your buck! Honestly no other bagel or breakfast place has even come close to the Bagel Cafe. Five STARS absolutely! not a bad thing to say about this amazing family owned restaurant. If you haven't been, your definitely missing out :)"}
{"text":"I really felt like I was walking into a bagel shop/bakery in New York City.  I was blown away by the selections when I walked into this place.  I don't know what was more impressive... the selection of bagels, the bakery selections with cakes and cookies, or the deli counter with all the authentic meats, fish, and condiments.  And that was just on the selection of items to go.  My suggestion is if you're coming here to eat, come at an \"off\" time.  One of the drawbacks is the parking and the parking lot.  It is in a strip center in which they have parking marked for designated businesses, so be careful where you park.  The other thing is I got there about 11:15 this morning.  And I got here just in time.  The parking area filled up fast, and so did the dining room.  And when I was leaving, there were people circling around trying to find parking spots.  The lady who took my spot, gave me just enough room to let me get out, before she started pulling in.  I took a seat at the counter, because there were only two available tables, and they were for four people, so I didn't want to take up a table for four (although other people alone were).  My server was a very nice young lady, who was very fast .  I ordered an Egg Bagel and a Sun-Dried Tomato Bagel, both with plain cream cheese and a small Black & White Cookie.  It took about ten minutes to get my order, which was fine given how busy they were.  Now, the other big drawback was that the bagels come in single baskets and the cream cheese is on the side.  Trying to spread the cream cheese on to the bagels, while in baskets is a chore, without making a mess.  I would prefer my cream cheese be already on the bagels.  If people want it on the side, they can ask for it that way.  Now, if you've ever been to New York, there are two things you will never get better anywhere else... pizza and bagels.  It's something in the water there that makes both of those things turn out so good.  However, these were the closest bagels I've ever had to real NYC bagels.  They were chewy with a little give, and the cream cheese was whipped perfectly with a great taste.  I enjoyed them both.  The Black & White Cookie was the best I've ever had!  It definitely made the meal complete.  I also had a glass of their Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice, which was awesome.  It was $14 for all of that, which I think was a pretty good deal.  I look forward to eating one of their over-stuffed deli sandwiches next time I go in there.  They looked awesome!   Also want to try their Potato Pancakes!  Definitely a great find and a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"We swung by here on Christmas morning to grab some bagels since Christmas Eve beget leftover smoked salmon. Bagels and lox? Yes, please. My relatives raved about this place, and rightly so because they weren't the only ones! It was packed when we ducked in around 9, but we ended up making it through the line fairly quickly. Service all along the way was great.

The bagels themselves are delicious. They were so chewy and doughy that I just wanted to eat more and more (but I didn't.) The cream cheese was very fresh and delicious as well. We opted for plain and the cheddar and garlic, and needless to say, it's hard to pick a favorite as they were both excellent.

Best. Bagels. Ever."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to take friends, family and visitors for breakfast or lunch. It's always busy because the food has a reputation for being great and consistent. 

PROS: The bagels
             Corned beef hash
             Nova Lox spread

CONS: Sun dried tomato and chicken pizza bagel"}
{"text":"Can't afford a trip to NY? No problem, just come here and eat your heart out. Bagels are authentic NY style, food is too. I had the bologna omelet and there were no regrets. Wish it was closer though cuz on Sundays it would be nice to pick up some of the baked goods to offer guests after a fat-a$$ Sunday dinner. :)"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, this is a really good deli ... for Las Vegas. I had a tongue tip sandwich, and it was enjoyable. But the only disappointment was the size of the sandwich. I actually toyed with the idea of getting a half ... a common practice at the finer NYC delis. And by the look of the picture in the menu, a half just may have worked so long as you settle for accompaniments like fries, potato salad, slaw, etc. So glad I went for the whole. C'mon Bagel Cafe, if you want to compete with your eastern counterparts, you're gonna have to put some more meat on those sandwich bones. The rye was very good, and an excellent pickle, but please do something about acquiring a house deli mustard. As for the bagels. What can I say. When it comes to bagels, size matters, but not the overriding determinant in quality. While they were big enough, they were way too dense and somewhat lacking in flavor. Yeah, I know, I know. Having grown up in the streets of Manhattan, I am way too spoiled to make comparisons. Maybe one day, I'll find a LV bagel that can compete with that of my alma mater. But Bagel Cafe, although good by LV standards, when it comes to comparing to those of dozens of Big Apple bagelaries ... puhleeze!!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best deli in Vegas!my husband and I come here for breakfast every Sunday.
From the time you walk in the door you are greeted by out of this world friendliness (which is hard here in Vegas)! Their food is no exception to out of this world goodness! You have a variety of breads, bagels, meat options, cheese options- and the beat part is that you can never go wrong with whatever you order. The best part is their veggie spread!.... Save the best for last!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a couple years now and the food is really good.The staff is friendly very friendly(thank you guys!) But let me tell you about this \"manager\" jerry. He is a joke!!!, very rude and inconsiderate. This \"man\" has no respect or manners for his guests, honestly I will not be returning here if this p.o.s is still working here. Anna is amazing .. She should be running this show :)..."}
{"text":"Another place you pass over & over but don't think of when it's time to eat out since we don't do breakfast out very often.
It was a Saturday morning & it was busy. As in the past, it took a little while to put in our food orders. As usual, everything was great. A little pricey but not compared to other places where the food is not nearly as good."}
{"text":"If you value your time and sanity avoid this place on weekends as an army of blue hairs invades, fueling up for a hard day of bingo and slots. At other times, this place is generally pretty pleasant. The food ranges from decent to excellent, the service is acceptable, but the pricing seems quite a bit higher than it should be. Recommended, but with some hesitation."}
{"text":"An awesome place and the food is out of this world.  I grew up back East in an Italian Jewish neighborhood and even though my nationality is neither I loved the food.  This place captures that.  The sandwiches are huge and the corn beef or pastrami has that traditional flavor.  There are early dinner specials here.  The bagels are fresh every day and wonderful.  Different types of cream cheese.  The deli section has all kinds of bakery products, deli meats and other food for take out.  They even sell Wise potato chips, a true Philadelphia-South Jersey icon.  This is a \"must\" place for both locals and visitors."}
{"text":"There were a few things I liked and a few I didn't about Bagel Cafe. To begin, the deserts and presentation of the restaurant looked great and very NY. The inside was huge and I'm glad that a local place like this was so full when I went for a late lunch around 1:30pm. The wait staff was slow but again pretty true to NY style in that part.  

The corned beef was very good but not fatty enough for my liking. The pickle eh. The matzo ball soup was quite good - very hearty. I thought the bagel greatly underwhelmed as the place is called Bagel Cafe. 

For $11 a meal the price seems high. Yes there's a lot of meat but honestly it's not as much as you'd expect for the price. Usually they are stacked double high (maybe $3-4 more but worthy of two meals). I was full but there was definitely not enough for a second meal. I would give Bagel Cafe a try if you're nostalgic for a NY deli, but don't expect the authentic experience. You'll get a good feeling for the food but not quite there."}
{"text":"Disgusted by the customer service experience. This is a place my husband and I went to when we lived in Las Vegas. We were back for our anniversary and thought we'd head here for breakfast. The food was fine, but the service was really upsetting. The waitress delivered our food and asked my husband if he wanted more coffee and then didn't return until it was time to deliver the check. I observed a young man bringing coffee to all the other tables. He never came to ours. After paying the bill and leaving a tip I wish I hadn't, my husband and I went to the bakery to buy some cookies. I went to the counter and one cashier served another woman ahead of me. I went to the other cashier who was serving someone and once she was done, she literally turned her back on me and started rolling silverware. 
I have never received such horrible customer service here. Awful and so disappointing."}
{"text":"average pricing, good service, the best tasting home fries that I have ever had, and they put pastrami in an omelet... I'm coming back! :)"}
{"text":"The ambience of this place is really cool. I love walking in and looking at all of the desserts. It's always crowded when you go in and it's funny to watch the elderly people their fight over tables because they think they're all regulars and on the place. I wanted to try something different then \"the bagel \". I tried it with lobster salad sandwich. Of course when you go to a place that is not known for a lobster salad sandwich you pretty much get what you pay for. I'm not sure there was any lobster in it but it was pretty good. And they serve it on a sourdough bread. Which was my fault of course but I thought that it would actually come on a roll the bread was so thin that it soaked through the salad sandwich and to be quite honest was subpar. So my recommendation when you go to this place is go for what's not on the menu I'll try the matzoh ball soup next time"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here for the first time and I didn't find anything that really stood out about this place, yet it's very busy. I had a chili omelette and it was very plain. We grabbed some deserts before we left and not anything exciting to talk about there. In my opinion it's a tad overpriced for very average food."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I moved here from DC a few months ago and having lived in New York City for years prior this place felt like home.  We have been for breakfast 4 or 5 times now and the french toast is awesome; the rest of the dishes we had (omelets/corn beef hash) were just okay.  You get a bagel with every dish so it's  A LOT of food.  You definitely get your money's worth here.  But after so many visits I will say I think the bakery side outshines the restaurant itself.  Every single thing we have taken to go has been amazing.   The knishes are a good way to rate a New York deli... and they are fantastic.  Not the ones labeled \"New York Knish\" but the round homemade ones; that's the real stuff.  The almond and coconut lemon rugelach are awesome.  The homemade hostess cupcake is amazing.  But never ever ever leave without a lemon bar."}
{"text":"This is one of my friend's favorite places. And I'm not a big bagel fans. Maybe I have had 1 or 2 a year, and 4-5 in last 10 years.

Just let me spell it out right now, my breakfast was edible. I can't even remember what I had. Typical and boring. My bagel and cream cheese were edible too.

Why 4-star? Well, let me tell you the story...

While we were waiting, I had a chance to glance at the dessert and pastry sections. I don't have a sweet tooth. So the selection was just yawning. And against my religion, they were twice the price than those in southern CA.

Why 4-star?

Well, I spotted the sugar free apple and regular peach pies. They were heavy and delicious looking. So I bought one each on the impulse. After I tasted it later, the flavor were GOOD, but it's too mushy underneath. I had to \"bake\" it upside down and inside out, to firm up the texture.

Well, that's not a 4-star experience. You're right. There are more to it...

While I was biting my breakfast item, I saw this bread with the corner of my eyes. This pile of breads was sitting on top of the shelf hiding behind the row of tall metal trays of baked carb. Memory flashback....

I had munched on freshly baked ambrosia tasting bread cooked by a friend in a ranch just half a year ago. It was good not just when it came fresh out of the oven, but as good when it was French toasted in thick slice on a grill.

The bread was challah and it was braided. So I bought one large loaf on the impulse. $5. That's the 2nd time in one day in one restaurant. And it was good and delicious.

So diners, I bet the items on the menu were good. That's why the restaurant was busy. My eyes were really set on the Challah."}
{"text":"Great food, healthy quantities.  Not giving 5 stars because it CAN be a bit pricy.  But otherwise, I love that place."}
{"text":"Omg yum! That's all I have to say. Yeah right. This place makes me want to buy everything. 

It's a seat yourself dining. Service is great! Cashier to when your food is ready. The matzo ball was delish. Very fulfilling and has great chucks of chicken and lots of veggies. Made me wish it was a bigger bowl. I also order some cookies but didn't get to take a picture of it. I got it and ate it quick.  I wish I got coffee but the cookie was just the right amount of sweets I can get. Yes coffee is part of my sweets. I also ordered a plain bagel mmmm very tasty. 

Would I come back?? Of course I would I have to try other things and there is so much to get."}
{"text":"Finally made it here been wanting to come here for 15 years. Drive by here so many times. 
Bagels are so delicious here. Very light and warm. 
Sad to say that the rest of our breakfast wasn't as delicious as the bagel. 
Either way I love the bagels"}
{"text":"By far one of the greatest but not well known breakfast places in Vegas/Summerlin area! Food is spectacular, prices are fair, and reminds me of New York more than any other place. Excellent bakery too! Totally recommend if In the area! Service is always the best as well, always helpful, and willing to bring out whatever you need! Excellent!"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious here. The pastries are unbelievable. Definitely get the matzo ball soup and the Reuben!"}
{"text":"It was an hour and half wait for our party of seven! lol But we also came on a Saturday around 12:30pm. 

We came here because a friend wanted to go and it was in my list of places to come check out! :D 

So really quickly it's a bakery/deli and a restaurant/cafe. They seem to get pretty busy on the weekends, seating for smaller parties went by faster than for our large party (typical). Oh! You also need to make sure your whole party is present or they won't seat you. 

So I ended up with an Asiago bagel with jalapeno cream cheese and biscuits and gravy! I couldn't decide on what I wanted so I settled and thought, \"you can't go wrong with biscuits and gravy.\" Yeah......nope! My bagel was much more appealing in taste than the biscuits and gravy. So a complete major disappointment in that. I liked the gravy but it could have used a little more flavor, there were large chunks of sausage in it which I think they could have cut up a little bit more. I like my biscuits in gravy with a LOT of gravy, like my biscuits need to be covered. I ran out of gravy before I ran out of biscuit, so it's a little disappointing to me. The bagel was good though!! I enjoyed getting chunks of jalapeno in my cream cheese :D 

Service wise - well it was alright. They were busy and we also had a decent size party so it's difficult, won't give them too much of a hackle for that. 

Overall it was a good experience, enjoyed some of the food but I want to try more stuff!!"}
{"text":"Pricy and not clean!
We first time went to there.It was so busy.We didn't like hot tea was cold.Milk container for tea makes mess.
First impression of Food didn't look good.Not like a for proffesional looking. Their Plates are so heavy and not clean.Pancakes are salty.sausage are fine. We didn't try bagle tho.I don't Know why this place is so busy.I feel not honest business here."}
{"text":"Very busy at 10am. I ordered the biscuits and gravy. The flavor was good and the portion large, but only had two small pieces of sausage in my gravy.  The scrambled eggs were spot on as was the bacon. $3.00 was a little steep for the 1-1/2 cups of coffee I had. My co-diner ordered the eggs Benedict and thouroughly enjoyed it. Good food. For $3.00, I should get more coffee."}
{"text":"1st time in.... Good food.. Pleasant  wait staff.... I will totally be back!!! With friends... Come with a appetite!!!"}
{"text":"Oh, Bagel Cafe. I've praised this place for its delicious sweets that are proudly on display. Too bad dining here was a disappointment. 

Everyone seems to brunch here on the weekends, so the wait can be up to 20 minutes. Not a problem, because staring at the dessert case is the best form of entertainment.

My boyfriend and I were seated at the very back of the restaurant, which I don't believe is ideal. I felt like we were left there and forgotten about until staff members came by to ask if they could take our extra chairs, and if they could use our table to hold dirty dishes for a few moments. I didn't mind at first, but this happened several times.

We were both first-time diners, so we didn't know that the menus were the newspapers shoved in between the condiments and the wall. I ordered the spinach and feta omelette with a side of whole wheat toast and a medley of fruit. Water from the feta leaked out from inside the omelette. 

Our waitress forgot our corned beef hash, which we looked forward to trying. She took note of our order once again, and disappeared only to return 20 minutes later with our check. 

I might return for the sweets, but never again for an actual sit-down meal. So much for that corned beef hash."}
{"text":"Seriously yummalicious baked goods! Huge sandwiches. The corned beef can be a little dry. The best mazoh ball soup in Vegas. Good smoked fish. This is the best Jewish deli in Vegas."}
{"text":"Been going here for years, never wrote a review.  I go about once every two or three months.
I always get the same thing-Pastrami on Rye, its simple the best traditional NY traditional sandwich in town. Its enormous and enough for two meals.  The staff is a plus and is always so friendly  

Go  here"}
{"text":"I placed an order via grub hub and they were wonderful the Manager at the Begal Cafe was very defiant.  I ordered a Vege Omelet with Turkey Bacon on the side and had ham in my Omelet. The Manager said he spoke to the cook who told him it was Turkey Bacon in the Omelet. Either way I did not order any meat on my food and the Manager refused to refund my Food, until back and forth with them and grub hub until I had him call while I waited. Poor service Manager. Needs to be retrained in CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"Top Jewish deli in town.  Pastries.  Huge portions. What more could my heart doctor ask for?"}
{"text":"Fabulous,  fabulous and fabulous. Went there for lunch and happy I did. I had the 1/2 lobster salad sandwich an a cup of matzo ball soup. There was so much  lobster on that 1/2 sandwich its was more than 2 lobster tails. My friend had 1/2 pastrami an matzo ball soup it too was huge. We topped it off with all huge piece of Tira Misu cake, for him and for me........ Cheese Blintzes with strawberry preserves and sour cream.  We were so full,  we couldn't move.  Try it,  you will love it, an if you don't..... well then there just something wrong with you!"}
{"text":"This place has the best bagels since moving out of NY over 25 years ago. In addition, everything I've had there, either dining in or take out has been fantastic. Cold cuts, deli salads, rainbow cookies (made the right way with almond paste), pastries, etc. etc. have all been outstanding. Wish I lived closer, but will be a must-stop every time I visit my family in Summerlin."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Best food EVER!! homemade corn beef and hash and matz ball soup !!"}
{"text":"The bagel cafe has delicious FRESH bagels! A family owned business that truly cares for their customers! The ambiance is casual and very clean. My favorites are the delicious nova platter, matzo ball and hearty cabbage soup. Unforgettable! They are busy on the weekends but that means they are loved by many so come early and check in with the hostess. They have even added beer and wine to the menu! Oh, and don't forget to try the black and white cookie for dessert!"}
{"text":"Best place ever and I didn't think that being vegan I could order anything.  I ate a vegan wrap in a spinach and herb bread with cucumber salad. The rest of my party are carnivores and were very satisfied with their corned beef sandwiches and matzo ball soup.

The soft drinks were awesome because the diet soda had just enough seltzer.  

The service was very good and the employees were very attentive. So we highly recommend eating here to all our friends and colleagues. 

Now on to the bakery case, large portions guaranteed to please. It's a very good thing that we don't live close to this café. 

TIP- if you are dining in you can request a military discount just for the military member (s.) If you are just picking up food then this discount is void.

The location is very convenient to Trader Joe's to shop for items."}
{"text":"This is a great deli! It's authentic! The servers are friendly and the service fast.

Had the matzo ball soup bowl and there was enough to take home since it was so hearty and filing. The bagels are delicious and the blueberry spread was yummy."}
{"text":"I love Bagel Cafe. I've never had anything that wasn't spectacular from bagels to sandwiches, soup and pastries it's all delicious.  Their biscuits and gravy is amazing and I don't even like gravy usually. My only complaint is they aren't closer to my house. It is right next to my dr office however and I will be stopping in as soon as I'm done today. Lol"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since 2001 I really really love their breakfast their omelets are pretty big actually enough for 2 people. They have the best crab benedict with hollandaise sauce. They give you a ton of crab meat and it's real crab meat not fake. If you love sandwiches there corned beef is incredible stacked super super high up. This is probably one of my favorite breakfast locations in Vegas I come here probably three to four times a month. If you're in the area definitely stop by and give Bagel Cafe a try."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Food is terrific.  Cookies are \"to die for\".  I wish this place was back home in San Antonio."}
{"text":"The food here is top-notch. Really great bagels. The service can suffer when they're busy, which is fairly often."}
{"text":"I have been back several times before writing this review update just to make sure all the inconsistency that I have been experiencing is now the way of Bagel Cafe and not just an off day they were having. I'm prepared for the loyal fixtures to be upset, but if you really have been eating here since it opened then you know it's not the same. I first started eating here at Bagel Cafe (I was a teenager) after it opened. It was worth the long wait to get a table as the food was spot on excellent. Sure we all know the best breakfast in town is at the Omelet House on Charleston, but this place definitely came close behind at one point. In the last 6 months I have experienced meals here at Bagel Cafe that were just not worth the money or wait for what you got. They don't even use Boar's Head deli meats anymore! WTH?!?!?!? They use some brand I have never heard of. The taste and quality of the deli meat just isn't the same as it used to be. They claim the bagels are made fresh daily yet they are rock hard. I have never liked the bagels here, but if it's in your name.... live up to it!

As you can tell from my previous review and pictures, I really used to like this place. Consistency is a major issue. The sandwiches used to be made with Boar's Head deli meat and was piled high between the bread of your choice and a real winner. Now you get some other brand of meat just bunched up in a ball between 2 dry pieces of bread. I can do that at home! Then there is breakfast. I usually order breakfast here. The last 3 times the coffee has tasted bitter and nasty. Getting a refill was a major chore as well. I noticed the servers didn't have name tags on my last visit or I would give a proper shout-out to the waitress who has messed up my order lately and has terrible customer service. I ordered \"One Egg any style W/Bacon\" priced at $8.95 and asked for eggs to be scrambled with shredded cheddar cheese on top. Such a simple breakfast right? Apparently not For Bagel Cafe. The breakfast also came with a bagel of my choice and breakfast potatoes. When my food arrived I noticed there was a slice of cheddar cheese on my eggs. UGH! If you don't have shredded cheese just let the customer know so they can maybe make another choice. I would have had the egg over medium or easy to dunk my bacon in if I had known. The \"Asiago\" bagel I had was so tough and hard!  I was with another yelper one of my last visits and showed him how I was able to bang the bagel on the table and it just broke in pieces.  The bacon was terrible. From the picture it looks heavenly, but let me tell you it was rock hard and seemed like it was honestly pulled from the fridge or something. When my meal arrived the bacon was missing, so I informed our waitress and she replies to me \"oh did you want bacon?\" to which I'm like HELL YES why would I have ordered a breakfast that comes with it if I didn't want it? She then brings me the cold/hard bacon and when the receipt comes she charged me $3.50 for a side of bacon. Seriously? It was supposed to come with the breakfast I ordered. She made me feel like I had done something wrong when she actually is a very lousy waitress. The potatoes I had were the only thing edible on the plate and even those aren't the same potatoes as they have had in the past. With this place not being consistent and having waitresses who can't do their job right, I'm going to  BabyStacks Cafe and Omelet House from now on for breakfast and will make the drive to Henderson to eat at Weiss."}
{"text":"Fantastic NY style sit down deli restaurant. We love the homemade chicken soup with matzo balls, the fresh bagels and rye bread, the lox and whitefish salad, the corned beef, and the omelets. In sum, it's all delicious and the service is always friendly."}
{"text":"I live right down the street so needless to say I eat here a lot! Literally every time I visit, the food is fresh and amazing.  Never once have I been let down.  The service can sometimes be iffy, but it's understandable seeing as they're always busy.  It's noticeable that the staff works their butts off and always try's their best to keep customers satisfied. My favorites here include ALL bagels, the spinach and feta omelette, and the eggs Benedict. Everything is good though."}
{"text":"I wish I was in town longer to enjoy more affordable delicious food at Bagel Café. To the Over stock of amazing deserts to the freshly made bagels and cream cheese. This place was a total HOME RUN. 

We stopped in for breakfast (my buddy recently moved to vegas and he lives right down the street) I had the nova lox Sammy, it was soooo good. The menu has a huge variety and there's many options for everyone. If your looking for an affordable place for breakfast or lunch this place is a no brainer."}
{"text":"I love this place. I stop in to buy bagels and cream cheese often. They have such a great variety. Sometimes there is a little bit of a wait but that's because they toast your bagel and put the cream cheese on. 
The desserts are also amazing. It's impossible to stand in line for a bagel and not drool over the desserts. 
I've never eaten inside but it looks like it would be pretty good. 
In 2007 my Husband passed away and we used Bagel Cafe for the gathering afterwards, it was delicious and convenient, and they were so nice about everything. 
My Uncle passed away in 2013 and my Aunt remembered how good the food was at my Husbands funeral that she decided to use them for the gathering for my Uncle as well."}
{"text":"Plethora of goodies!

I shouted to the bagel master, make me whatever you want! And viola - he came out with a blueberry muffin with strawberry cream cheese!

Ok Ok -- i really came for the Matzo ball soup (taste just like Chicken Noodle soup) as a special request, but I couldn't help myself with the fresh baked good, homey ambiance of the locals that were enjoying their meals. 

I shall return to sit down and experience a little bit more when I'm back in town.

The service was great.!"}
{"text":"This place is right in my neighborhood, but I never went until now, as I am moving away. 

They have takeout, but I dined in. I had a bagel sandwich (hot and fresh, but not chewy like I prefer), coffee (truly terrible), and a side of citrus fruit salad that just tasted bad. It didn't seem fresh and had an off taste. 

The service was good, and I would not hesitate to come back for takeout bagels. I would just make my own coffee."}
{"text":"After reading this before posting , the sound of this review may sound as if I may be  affiliated with this place . I can assure you I am not in any way. I am a relatively new customer of theirs and the following are my impressions after about 3 visits. 

 Doesn't get better in Las Vegas . Grew up in NY and have struggled to find a good deli / bagel place . This by far and away is the closest to NY. They have takeout for most things sold which includes deli / bakery /bagel items. They also have a sit down restaurant which is great.  Breakfast items I have tried have all been excellent .  Standouts are the Corn beef hash , two styles of knish (3 are stuffed one is NY style )  Bagel sandwiches are fantastic. Looking around the dining room will only make you have ordering remorse as you see the awesome selections other people have ordered. The menu is very large offering many traditional Jewish dishes which are staples in NY  and traditional american breakfast plates . 
The one thing that truly stood out is the service. I have gone to 5 star restaurants and have spent more than a mortgage payment on meals that included sommeliers and waiters with assigned assistants, and not received anywhere close to the service and unbelievable upbeat  attitudes as the staff there.  
So from bagels with numerous cream cheese options , to the diet killing bakery counter with things like cannoli , black and white cookies , rainbow cookies , gourmet muffins etc etc to the NY deli staple the classic (bagel) breakfast egg sandwich , this place has it all .   

minor cons not worth even bumping them from a strong 5 star review. 

#1 Take-out does not have a large menu posted  to know whats available at the takeout window when ordering. 

#2 (I'm sure they have heard this a thousand times) The parking lot is tight and cramped . Be on your toes and bring along a little extra patience . its worth the minor inconvenience . 

#3 No chocolate-milk in the bottled  beverage cooler. I think in NY its is part of the licensing agreement for anyone selling bagels to have it on hand. I guess not in Las Vegas. 

#4 it can get crowded on the weekends. It has been around fore a long time. keep in mind there is a reason people will wait 20-30 minutes.  Early bird rules apply ."}
{"text":"Solid food, good service and easy access...

The location is on Buffalo, right off the Summerlin parkway. 

The bagels are delicious, the cream cheese is really fresh and they do some serious meats! (The bacon, sausage, cornbeef and chorizo are all great) 

Great spot for a solid east coast breakfast/brunch.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"For a taste of my home town, New York City, this is the only place in Las Vegas.  I don't know how they do it but their bagels taste like bagels not dough balls.  Their food is fabulous and the service is great.  Love their huge salads, especially the shrimp salad.  Their Sicilian Omelette, egg salad, etc. etc. etc.  I have been for breakfast, lunch, dinner and take-out.  Reminds me of Sunday mornings when I was very young and the bagels, lox, cream cheese and white fish brunches at my grandparents.  LOVE this place. Desserts are huge and they have the all important Black & White cookie and their sugar free Rugalah is awesome as is the regular."}
{"text":"The perfect Jewish New York deli! The counter has everything you miss from back in the neighborhood and it's all homemade. The diner is great for an on the go meal. Service is friendly and fast. Suggest the chicken liver pate and the bagels and locks."}
{"text":"Great food!!!!  Bagels are awesome. All breakfasts come with homemade bagels and homemade cream cheese. There are many different types to choose from. Their matza ball soup is my husbands favorite!!!!!
They have a great deli with lots of choices and amazing selection of fresh made pastries. Give it a try. It's our favorite place for breakfast and worth the drive!!!"}
{"text":"Black and white cookie:  More cake-like than cookie, not horrible but I wouldn't order it again.

Red Velvet Cupcake:  I was told it was buttercream frosting in which case it was not good buttercream frosting.  Add to that just by appearance the cupcake to frosting ratio is a little off and it was a tad dry.  I can get a four-pack of cupcakes from Trader Joe's for $3.99 that taste better.  

Hostess cupcake:  I did not like the taste of the filling and it seemed like that ratio was also off as far as too much filling and it didn't help disguise the dryness.    

I've heard good things about this place and the dining area was packed so I would like to come back and try items off the regular menu but now I know to just steer clear of the desserts."}
{"text":"The food is super good (the deli and bakery is awesome - great black-and-whites!) but you'll leave smelling like Bagel Cafe for the rest of the day. Pro tip: the corn beef hash is out of a Hormel can."}
{"text":"First time here with the baby sis and it was great! Nice little spot and the bagels are insanely good! They have a \"cream cheese\" of the month platter they give you as an appetizer and my baby sis and I fell in love with your Tropical Fruit cream cheese. Food was excellent and very good portions. They also have a deli and bakery which made me extremely happy to find some Black & White cookies - hopefully they are as good as the ones in my hometown bakery in Cali. Will be a regular here for a good breakfast spot."}
{"text":"My most recent visit has made me have to dock a star...the service wasn't up to par and neither was the food. I don't think it's gone down in quality, but I think we just caught the place on a bad day. 

My bagel and cream cheese was still delicious, though!

Note to self: I'm there for the matzoh ball soup or pastrami sandwich. Anything else is a huge mistake. They drown their salads in dressing - make sure to ask for it on the side."}
{"text":"We FINALLY made it to The Bagel Cafe in search of a breakfast spot we had never been to. Why the heck did it take us so long!?!?!? Better late than never, right?

This place was packed when we stepped inside, but luckily for us, a booth was waiting with our name on it which was great because I'm not much of a fan sitting at open tables in the middle of the dining room of a . Talk about selection here!!! People really look like they're reading the Sunday Paper! That's how extensive their menu is...our waitress checked back on three different occasions laughing because we were kinda overwhelmed on deciding what to get.

I knew I wanted a bagel, and it'll almost always be an Everything Bagel with Nova Spread. 
Wifey wanted a cup of their popular Matzo Ball soup(which was also a first for me, I think)
and the Challah French Toast. Along with my bagel, I had to have a Potato Pancake with sour cream and apple sauce, and I've never had a Knish, so I added one of their meat and potato ones. The Matzo Ball Soup was very good, and my bagel was as I imagined-nicely toasted and chewy like a NY bagel. The Nova spread was pretty bomb too. The Potato Pancake was simple, straightforward, and delicious. Something in the flavor of the Knish was kinda foreign to me, and after 2-3 bites, I was done with that...At least I didn't knock it before I tried it! Wifey also failed to read that the soup came with a bagel, so she chose a Cinnamon-Raisin Bagel with cinnamon-raisin cream cheese which we enjoyed. The French Toast arrived and this plate looked like it came from Hash House A Go-Go!?

Bigger doesn't necessarily mean better IMO....all I could taste was egg, egg, and more egg. The challah wasn't soaked enough either. A little cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla extract does wonders! Overall, it was a great first visit. Tasty food, great service, and a great local spot to start your morning....ALOHA!!!

{"text":"The Bagel Cafe deserves its name. It really does bagels well. They are more than a cut above what you can get from your local supermarket or Einstein's Bagels or some such thing. They are doughy and delicious, and come with fresh ingredients to accompany, such as lox, cream cheese, and whatever else you want that is kosher. The desserts are very strong, too. I would not put too much stock in the rest of the restaurant fare, but as for the bagels and the dessert, you cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"Best bagels in Vegas, hands down! It aint NY but its pretty damn close!"}
{"text":"Best bagels ever! Best breakfast in Vegas! Best cannolis in Vegas!  Excellent service!

I came to The Bagel Cafe dozens of times when I lived in Vegas and especially when I worked in the same business complex this restaurant is part of on Buffalo, right off of the freeway.  I visited recently while on a trip and it is the same amazing place.  Voted 13 years now for Best Breakfast by readers of the Las Vegas Review Journal, this cafe with fresh bread, bagels, pastries, desserts, a deli and serving lunch too is a real gem.  

My fave bagel was the pumpernickel and they still make it.  Damn it is good.

I love the spinach and feta omelet.  The cannolis are superb, the real deal, and they are huge.  I recommend the latkes, eggs benedict, and chopped potatoes.  The chopped potatoes have this tomato zing to them that is just right on the dot.  

For lunch, get a sandwich that will have enough meat on it to feed three firemen.  Try the corned beef.  Yummy!  Salads are great too and yes, my friend, they come with a bagel and cream cheese.  If you can't eat it all, take that bagel home for a snack later because you can't waste heaven.

When it's warm and sunny, there's outdoor seating which makes the situation even better.

You can order ahead for carryout or go to the counter to your right upon entering to get your bread, dessert, sliced Boar's Head or anything else they offer to go. They also offer catering.

Portions are nice and big.  I couldn't finish my omelet but I shoved it in because you can't waste food like this.  I took the rest of my bagel to go.  Oh man are the bagels the best.  And big.

Get some kind of dessert and take it to go if you're going to explode.  You won't be disappointed. You've got the black and white cookie, hamentashen, Mexican wedding, and holy mother, they even make cheesecake the right way - the NY way.

There's never been an issue with service here.  A little blunt when they have a line out the door for people paying their tab but not at all rude, just busy.  

You get your choice of the bread you want when you order breakfast, which is served all day.

A taste of New York in Vegas.  Don't miss this.  

Parking stinks because the cafe is in a business park that lacks parking to begin with and it super busy due to the popularity.  It's worth dealing with it though.  

The atmosphere is that of a deli.  Simple but good tables and chairs with a NYC skyline painted on one wall and everything's clean. It gets pretty noisy when they are busy which is to be expected.  You may have to wait 30  minutes for a table; they don't take reservations, this is a casual restaurant.  However, it's worth the wait and service is fast.

I would not bring kids here simply because of how big the portions are and really, the food is just so amazing it would be wasted on a kid's palate.  It is family friendly though so I'm probably just being a snob. ;)

{"text":"I'm from New York and Jewish so that's a double whammy for this place.  Expensive isn't close to the right word.  Dr. Brown's sodas are 2.50, give me a break the local supermarkets sell them for 1.25.  Smiths has kosher food that is 1/2 the price.  The quality is ok but really overpriced.  Also you can't get a great bagel in Las Vegas because of the water out here which is terrible.  It's ok but don't go out of your way."}
{"text":"Fantastic bagels and homemade cream cheese.  If you're looking for a New Jersey dinner / bagel deli in Las Vegas, this is it."}
{"text":"We come here a couple of times a month for bagels and pastries. Occasionally we eat first. I love there sweet and sour cabbage soup.  Love there bagels and often get there scallion cream cheese. The kids love the black and white cookies.  Slightly pricier than other breakfast places but from NY and like the bagels compared to other places in town."}
{"text":"Ok, so maybe it's a bit ironic to call the Jewish Deli/Bakery the \"Holy Grail\" of Jewish restaurants, but we recently moved to Las Vegas from LA, and I've been looking everywhere to find a place like this.  As it turned out it was less than a mile from our new house.  They have amazing bagels, pastry, and other jewish food, and great breakfast too.  It's a can't miss place!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! I got the egg everything bagel and the nova cream cheese. Oh man, they were delicious. They didn't skimp on the lox at all! It was delicious and a great surprise. My friend got the spinach feta bagel with (I think) scallion cream cheese. She ate hers as fast as I did!

I also shared a slice of the cheesecake with fruit on top with my friend, the cheesecake by itself was soo good, but that fruit stuff was weird. It was this strange, artificial strawberry goop that just tasted unpleasant. However, I would recommend ordering the cheesecake plain! 

Come check this place out! The bakery is huge and impressive, so even for the free sniffs, stop on in!"}
{"text":"Gets a 1 because zero isnt an option. Charging $13 for a sandwich is insane in itself, so to be a \"New York style\" spot, I put my faith in the sheer cockiness of charging such an outlandish price expecting a phenomenal sandwich. What I got was a unbelievably generic below par sandwich. Run of the mill bread, two slices of store bought cheddar, over cooked and under seasoned brisket. That's it. Nothing else.. IT WASNT EVEN WARM. Cheese not melted at all. They have the nerve to put packets of mayo and guldens mustard in the to go container with the sandwich.  Can't be bothered to dress their own sandwiches. Only thing good about this order was the pickle on the side.
Shame on you for charging people 2x the normal amount for a sandwich of this quality. Even at $6 it would have been disappointing."}
{"text":"Great New York deli style food with amazing foods and dessert. Large portions and good value. Staff and management are super friendly and nice. Highly recommend for breakfast, lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I have been to the Bagel Cafe a few times now. It always leaves me satisfied! The food is good, for a nice breakfast or lunch, however prices and crowds might scare some people away. 
It's definitely very good and I love the staff. The bakery is phenomenal! But if you're not into crowds don't go! Unless is an off night/day which might be better!"}
{"text":"A great NY deli style cafe/bakery with wonderful food.   Although it can get very busy especially on Saturday and Sunday mornings, but that just goes to show you how good they are.   I love having my bagel and lox there when ever I can."}
{"text":"I'll start with the good. The portions are huge, loved the philly steak. The egg salad sandwich was nothing special but then again, it's never special. LnL definitely has the superior macaroni salad. My pickle had an identity crisis, it couldn't decide to live life as a pickle or a cucumber rinsed in vinegar.

The service was weird. There was no greeting when we walked in. We stood by the \"Please wait to be seated\" sign awkwardly until the cashier told us 3 minutes later to seat ourselves. Look, the sign told me otherwise, how was I supposed to know what to do?

Once we sat down, we waited for someone to take our drink orders and to give us menus. Took us a second to realize they have those crappy newspaper menus like Egg Works on the condiment stand. Invest in regular menus please.

The waitresses were completely unorganized, two different ladies tried to take our drink order.

I wouldn't come back, even if their dessert case was the only display I appreciated."}
{"text":"Bagel Cafe has an impressive authentic deli full of real deal pastries and fabulous cheese selections meats and breads."}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars but the service and way we were treated when we went to pay and buy additional baked goods was horrible. We were ignored by guys behind the counter. Waited by the side cashier for 10 minutes while she said \"oh you have to wait for a guy to get your ordered\". By then we had it. Put back the $14 pie we were going to buy and lost a sale for additional items. Would have been nice if when we told the waitress we wanted a few things she could have made sure someone helped us out at least when we walked but but she was MIA half the meal too. Guess we'll make the trip to Weiss next time because at least we will get great service."}
{"text":"Corned beef cabbage was delicious. Matzo ball soup was OK. I had it better in New York.  
Fries were very good as well. Salads are huge.  Share it with someone portions are big."}
{"text":"I had brunch last Sunday and the eggs Benedict was amazing! The black and white cookie didn't disappoint either! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE breakfast here... The omelets are amazing... Bagels are fresh and cream cheese that you cannot find anywhere! Their desserts are incredible and have something that appeals to everyone in your party! It's a bit tucked away, but if you're ever in the area, try it! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place was a disappointment. I made an order through GrubHub and the asiago bagels had a few specs or spots of cheese. The cheddar jalapeño lacked both ingredients and my daughters fruit parfait had a moldy raspberry.  Only two stars for the chives cream cheese. I spent over $50 and was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast, very unfriendly welcome from the staff, very unprofessional set up,mediocre quality and portions, but above all, very expensive $15 for a thin lox bagel without coffee, when at Station Casinos breakfast is under $10 everything included? Never again...Actually, they deserve 0 stars, not even one."}
{"text":"We went to the bagel cafe to get some bagels and also some pastrami to make sandwiches at home.   
  I ordered a pound of pastrami which was over $16 and asked to see what it looked like, and it looked fine.  However, when we got it home it was dried out a bit and very, very lean that it tasted like corned beef instead.   I warmed it up and it was totally dry.    It had no fat on it which maybe might be good, but this had no taste at all.  Very disappointed in the pastrami.  If it doesn't have any fat in it, it is tasteless.  I will not buy this again.  Bagels, yes, pastrami, NO!  Sorry!  Bought some sable fish also, which was good,but $50 a lb???? wow! ( only bought a few slices and  it was over $15)"}
{"text":"Great pastrami sandwich! Make sure you request the navel versus brisket pastrami. Follow that up with some butter cookies! Yum, yum!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this restaurant! If your looking for a huge meal look no further than the Bagel Cafe! I love their breakfast, lunch and dinners! The pastries and the fresh baked bagels and in house cream cheese are all amazing! Come hungry! The staff is All amazing too! A+++++"}
{"text":"I had a special request for a Las Vegas themed wedding cake for my son's wedding in November & The Bagel Cafe did an amazing job! Their wedding cake looked perfect & was so delicious!! I love this place great food & a phenomenal bakery! I highly recommend them if your looking for an amazingly delicious dessert or cake for your special occasion!"}
{"text":"Ok, so returned for a 2nd visit and this went much better than breakfast on my last visit. Had a bowl of chicken soup and it was terrific. Took some dill pickles to go, big disappointment... Weiss beats them hands down. But the soup was a winner..."}
{"text":"Love the food but also heather is an amazing server!!!! I will be back soon to continue to enjoy the food and the wonderful service !!!!"}
{"text":"We took bagels and cheesecake to go--which reminds me, I still have the cheesecake in the fridge. BRB FOOLS. 

Yum! Now that I have been reminded what a delicious cheesecake this is, I feel I have the strength to write the rest of this review. My friend and I got the strawberry cheesecake for our late-night Netflix girltime dessert fancies, and bagels and cream cheese for the next morning's airport run shenanigans. 

I tend to like a more dense, fatty, hilariously-bad-for-you cheesecake, but this one is light and airy and is a-okay for me. The fruit on top is good, but I don't like the red-40 laced syrup they drizzle on top of it. Next time I'll just get the plain because it's a good cheesecake overall.

However, the real winners here are the namesake of the Cafe--the bagelssssss. I got spinach and feta, my friend got the egg bagel with everything on it. Both were good, though after spending the night in the fridge, were nearly impossible to cut. I eventually got them both in the toaster and gobbled all those carbs at 7am (which led me to sleepy time for most of the rest of the day). 

All in all a decent place. I want to try it as a restaurant instead of a deli, too. Good thing it's right down the street from my best friends' house so I have an excuse to visit!"}
{"text":"This place is always good, chopped liver and potato pancakes are my favorite thing. The variety of the menu is great the bagels are good, the cream cheese selection is great as well. I'm not a fan of the service as it's inconsistent, one visit it's great and other visit it's awful. 

The cookies are not good, black & white cookie is more like cake and the chocolate chip big cookie is beyond dry I could probably break drywall with it.. but the cakes I've tried are pretty tasty. 

Overall, avoid the cookies, everything else on the menu is good and beware of inconsistent service"}
{"text":"Best bagels in town! This isn't some bagel chain store, they truly put heart into their baking and food. Everything is so delicious and their baked goods display is so beautiful!"}
{"text":"I LOVE bagels!!! Did I mention that I LOVE bagels?? 
My current hometown does not have a bagel spot and so it's either a grocery store or bakery that I have to find bagels at and then all the yummy goodies that go with bagels are non existence with the above options so I'm left with having to concoct my own or just adding some cream cheese, again nothing fancy, just store bought...... meh.
Sooooo, when traveling and breakfast is a must, I tend to look for bagel shops and this yummy place popped up on Yelp, so we made our way over. Location is not the best, it was a Saturday so that didn't help but parking was sparse and crowded and once we walked in the place was HUGE! The greeter was super nice and I asked how long it would take to be seated as there was so many people and she advised if we where on a time constraint that we should order at the deli, this was greatly appreciated. This cafe is basically a full fledged restaurant in the rear with an open deli/ bakery in the front and it's a great concept!
We where super pleased with our food, LARGE portions and so many options! A great place for breakfast and BAGELS!"}
{"text":"I've been living in Las Vegas for years and for the longest time I would constantly drive by this place but never got the chance to check this place out. Truthfully, whenever I think about bagels I would think about Einsteins and didn't have the desire to stop by. However, my sisters (fellow Yelpers) and I decided to try this place out since its been bookmarked in our Yelp all for a long time. 

From the moment you step into this place, your transported back east to New York. The cafe set up is straightforward with a large dinning room on one side and a bakery/deli on one side for takeout. There is a constant flow of people coming in and leaving. It's apparent by the many awards and celebrity photos with autographs that this cafe is very popular.

We ended up sitting in the dinning room and ordered 3 different omelette, lol. A cool thing about the omelette dish, it came with a choice of a side item. We all opted for the homestyle fries and was very pleased with the flavor and consistency of the seasoned potatoes (highly recommended). Each dish came with a Bagel and Cream Cheese of your choice, which was unexpected since our omelettes dishes were very sizable in portion. We ended up getting a plain, everything and asiago bagel. All the bagels were fresh and delicious with no compliant, just prepare yourself for a carb craze meal. The 3 omelettes we got were the Mushroom and Cheese, Veggie and Spinach and Feta Cheese, which was our favorite but they were all good. Overall we had a great experience and our server Kayla was good and knowledgeable about everything including the history of The Bagel Cafe. We will come back to try out more of their delicious food!

2017 Yelp Review #25"}
{"text":"Upon walking into this cafe everything looked delicious and fresh! In addition to the multitude of bagel and cream cheese selections, there were also several pastries and such to choose from. I had the spinach and feta bagel with the cream cheese with smoked salmon mixed into it and it was good! They put A LOT of cream cheese though, and the spinach and feta bagel didn't really taste like spinach or feta. I will definitely stop by again when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that the nova cream cheese is no joke. Absolutely delicious. And the bagel is on point.  I've had the sandwiches here before and they're damn good too but pricey.  I'm  very disappointed with their \"omelet\" however.  When I think of an omelet I think of ingredients bound together by egg.  Apparently their definition is different. 

I got the Ruben omelet expecting to have meat and sauerkraut and cheese throughout the omelet.  What I got instead was a Ruben sandwich with an egg wrap.  That's right. An egg wrap.  With the cheese on top.  I was extremely disappointed. I ended up just eating the meat.  Everything should have been mixed together with the egg.  And for the price is was absolutely not worth it.  The bagel and nova cream cheese were delicious which is the only saving grace.  I'm never getting an omelet here again!"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome! The ONLY reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because they really need to clean their bagel case. I was looking at it and on the top left I saw spider webs and a lot of dust all over. Nasty... but yes, I still got a bagel with my breakfast and it was the best ever. 

JUST PLEASE CLEAN YOUR BAGEL CASE!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this place is the best. No matter what I have ever ordered it's always amazing, they have the best matzoh ball soup! And this's family owned restaurant really does have great severance."}
{"text":"Great locals place for breakfast or lunch . Delicious matzo soup // and crazily their fruit salads are the best in town"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely disgusting. My egg benedict just made throw up and their potatoes are also just as disgusting. I literally threw up a little when any of their food touched my mouth. Service is also slow. Would not ever go there again"}
{"text":"Super impressed by this place! Amazing size portions and very helpful staff. Food was amazing! Prices were a bit higher but when I saw the portion size- made complete sense! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best bagel in town hands down! Reminds me of bagel stores in New York. A bit pricey but then again you get what you pay for. I usually get bagels and some pastries."}
{"text":"Absolute WORST customer service ever!!!! Ordering from here twice within a week on grub hub, Same EXACT lox platter which is like $18+ platter. First time it was delicious, less than week later ordered same EXACT platter and it tasted like someone dumped entire container of salt on the ENTIRE platter, absolutely disgusting!!! I called to complain and the rude manager didn't care.. kept saying the lox I ordered is the salty one... didn't even acknowledge that I told him everything on the platter was salty even the olives and tomatoes, didn't acknowledge that I mentioned that I ordered less than a week ago and no excuse for the inconsistency.. he was so rude and didn't care one bit! NEVER AGAIN WILL I ORDER FROM HERE. I'll take my business elsewhere. Zero stars! We would have been regulars if their was consistency in their food and decent customer service when a problem arises. Gross!!!

After reading restaurants reply below: Again, I explained to the manager that I ordered the SAME EXACT PLATTER twice in a week & have receipts on grub hub showing identical order, I ever offered to show them...yet you cannot even acknowledge the severe inconsistency in your foods from one day to the next instead you insult me and say I used profanity and blame me for the item I ordered . Yes, I ordered the belly lox, both times...so in that case why was the first platter not salty? Horrible customer service any other establishment would have refunded or sent new item! Unacceptable gross place never again will I eat here I'll send my business elsewhere 

I did give him a chance to fix the issue by Calling and he didn't do a thing. Waste of time and money 


I will Call grub hub too now to complain thank you for the idea!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here after having this place bookmarked for a month or so and driving by on a weekly. My boyfriend and I finally came in on a Sunday morning and it was packed! I was so sad because I was starving and anxious for some delicious food. The wait was only about 15-20 minutes and we got to stare at all of the delicious-looking pastries in the mean time.

After being seated, we browsed through the menu (which looks like a newspaper) and it was pretty hard for us to make up our mind. My boyfriend decided to get the chicken-fried steak with eggs, potatoes, and a super egg onion bagel while I got the mushroom and cheese omelet with potatoes and a jalapeño cheese bagel. 

His chicken-fried steak was delicious, he said, and the bagel was SO good. I definitely should have ordered that bagel instead because I felt that the jalapeño-cheddar bagel was lacking in flavor. It was still good, especially with their amazing cream cheese on the side, just not super flavorful.

My mushroom and cheese omelet was pretty good, cheesy and mushroomy like you'd expect. The fresh-squeezed orange juice was literally the best orange juice I've ever had in my life. No exaggeration there. It was delicious. 

The service was quick and super friendly! After we ate, even though I was so full that I was bursting at the seams, we went to go get pastries. We splurged. We got raspberry, coconut lemon, blueberry, and apple cinnamon rugalach as well as a \"mini\" eclaire, chocolate dipped macaroon, chocolate dipped Florentine, and raspberry linzer tart. We devoured all of those within 2 days of going there. No regrets... Besides not buying the coconut cream cake and almond horseshoe but we're saving those for next time! :D coming back soon!!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe that I've never written a review for The Bagel Cafe.  I have dined here well over a dozen times since I moved to Vegas.  They offer the closest thing to New York bagels that I have found in LV.  Both their breakfast and lunch menus have so many delectable choices that remind me of the East Coast.  The line for a table is almost always long, but worth the wait. They also have limited counter seating.

Recently,  I have enjoyed the Matzo Ball Soup, which is chock full of large pieces of carrot, celery, onion, and chicken in addition to a fluffy matzo ball.  A cure for what ails you (or just a tasty soup).  The chicken salad platter- a large scoop of chicken salad, two sides, pickle spears and veggies to make a sandwich with your bread or bagel choice.  The chicken salad is what I would call 'traditional style', no fruit, nuts, or other surprise items mixed with the chicken and celery.

On recent breakfast trips, we've enjoyed the fantastic Potato Pancake with applesauce and sour cream.  Definitely a welcome reminder of Jewish delis back home.  A huge portion of biscuits and gravy with eggs and bacon and some of their omelets.  

We always seem to walk out with a bag from their bakery case too. Not sure how this keeps happening. ;-)  We freeze most of the bagels and they taste just as good after we take them out.  The cheesecake, carrot cake, cookies, and all the other bakery items we've tried have all been well above par."}
{"text":"Favorite bagel place in Vegas! Divine.  Don't even get me started on the cream cheese"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this spot more, I really did! The service leaves something to be desired, and they definitely seem to have good and bad days. The food is relatively good, but I do find it hit or miss. The menu is huge, notoriously in my experience it leaves a lot of room for flaws and inconsistency. When you try to pay, you almost always have to wait for somebody to get over to the cashier area. 

The take out area is much better, and since my numerous visits here I've pretty much given up on eating in and just get things to go. The bagels are great, and a toasted everything bagel with the cream cheese just oozing all over still warm when you walk out and bite in...there's little that beats it. That is why I will still frequent here, but probably the only reason. For this I am thankful"}
{"text":"Ordered to go breakfast. When we got home and were about to eat, we found out someone took out the inside of the blueberry bagel. I'm not sure if the restaurant reuses the bagels served on other tables or the staff ate some of the bagel and wrapped in the bag.. it was disgusting. Please open and check your food while you are in the restaurant if you order take out.

Also I ordered 3 over hard eggs with grilled lemon pepper turkey and sliced tomato. They put homemade home fries instead of tomato in the box. This is not the first time they mess up the order. The turkey tasted so salty."}
{"text":"Foods tastes amazing! Carb and fat  overload for your soul! I have been a few times and could of had better service. They forgot a order and waiting way longer than should of."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast in Las Vegas. Good prices , great selection of bagels and desserts."}
{"text":"If I would give a half a star if I could. My group taste tested several cookies for our event. We made our selection after waiting in 2 different lines. We made an order for pick up 4 days later and paid in advance. I arrive and the order was not prepared. The hostess hastily grabbed cookies from the display case so we didn't even get the type of cookies we'd ordered."}
{"text":"First timer! Heard so many great things. Walked in three girls saw us stand there and didn't have it in them to greet us...say hello I'll be right with you...would have been nice! One walked by to stock napkins on the right hand side....still nothing. Not even a smile. Sign did say please wait to be seated. Waited five minutes finally one of the girls came over and said \"For two?\". That was it!!! She seated us and said your server will be right with you. Great! Thanks for making me feel welcomed. To be honest the girls behind the counter look miserable. They need to cheer up or look for another job. Thankfully Elaina came to the rescue. She was amazing! She made my experience worth coming back. At least you have an employee that actually wants and acts like she wants to be there. Don't forget you're on stage! Thank you for the great recommendations Elaina!"}
{"text":"The staff (especially the cashiers) appear to hate life and their jobs. Food is amazing, just don't expect to have a pleasant experience with their employees"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Pepperoni pizza bagel is really good and so is the steak and egg plater. Pretty inexpensive too!"}
{"text":"How did I not ever review The Bagel Cafe?  Well, I guess I did live down the street from this place for two years before ever eating here.   The Bagel Cafe is one of my girlfriend's favorite restaurant, so I've been here quite a few times this year.  They have a huge menu with decent prices, and they have all the regular Jewish food you'd hope for, from matzo ball soup to blintzes.  It's all delicious!"}
{"text":"Not a great start. Sat here 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged me. When I finally did get some service I gave the entire order. Didn't want to take the chance that I might have to wait again. Bagels are really good fresh and a nice variety. I had the jalapeño cheddar with 2 oz of lox. Generous 2 ounces. Overall food good. Service below average."}
{"text":"It's far away from where I live, but it's always worth the drive. I lived on the east coast my entire life before moving to Vegas and this place feels like home to me. Admittedly I've never had anything other than the bagels here- but because they're so good! I've had their various sandwiches on bagels and always been happy with the food. The prices are reasonable, the service is quick, friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I've been here on multiple occasions and have loved the great service and delicious food. However, after my experience today I am not sure if I will return and this is why:
Each item that we ordered was wrong. 
I waited long for my turkey pot pie and when I finally received it, it wasn't cooked. 
Luckily the waitress was apologetic, otherwise I would have given one star. 
The food is good, but they need to get it together before this place goes down hill."}
{"text":"Huge portions, but lacks quality. Have eaten at the Del Mar and was hoping this place would be better. It wasn't however! But if you want quantity over quality then this is the place for you. This place is called the BAGEL cafe and the bagels are excellent!"}
{"text":"I only wish this place was closer to the SW area!  Not too many places here (I'm a Boston transplant) have ever heard of a \"Rachel\" (instead of a Rueben), never mind, know how to make one. They did a bang up job of it and I'd definitely go back for another! Didn't try any of their desserts....I was way too full..LOL."}
{"text":"The Bagel Cafe is amazing. If your in the area you have to stop here! It's diffidently an experience. Sunday brunch was awesome, the house was packed but not overwhelming. We were seated after maybe 5-10 minutes even though it looked like there wasn't an empty table as far as the eye can see. This was perfect because the first thing you see when you walk in is their awesome bakery which is all freshly made! So you need a few minutes to check out the goods. Literally everything looked amazing! Not to mention all the other goods available. We had an awesome brunch, great service and loved hearing the buzz and laughter of fellow patrons! We will diffidently be back!"}
{"text":"the food is always fresh and high quality.  my only problem with the place is i don't feel like i get value for my buck.  nice bakery too but it suffers the same overpriced fate."}
{"text":"Being my first time here, The bagel Café was overwhelming with flavor and humans. My boyfriend and I waited 25 minutes for a table. The wait went by quickly though and we began our feast. I ordered corn beef hash with an asiago bagel and plain cream cheese. My boyfriend got a pastrami sandwich which looked divine. We also ordered dessert to go which I highly recommend. Next time I think that I will do to go instead of sitting down. The food was well worth the long wait and inconsistent service."}
{"text":"Wonderful Food... 

Big Blonde Girl never smiles... Baby fussy in booth... Delivered food and parents had to ask for Apple Juice already ordered and forgotten.., Then they had to ask for booster seat.  When I served food, I always made sure the kids were taken care of that were fussy and hungry.  Even crackers are a life saver to parents and patrons next to a fussy child..."}
{"text":"I went to the Bagel Café to try some of their bagels after a disappointing purchase at a different shop nearby.  I got a half dozen, assorted flavors - 2 salt (lots of salt on both sides) - 2 everything, and 1 jalapeño, and 1 sun dried tomato.  After trying a salt bagel this morning, I'm hooked.  A salt bagel is what I use to judge a bagel shop and this one was perfect. 

I had quick service at the store and the price was right.  They have a new customer!"}
{"text":"I stopped here last night on the way out of Red Rock Casino and bought a few bagels to bring home.  I had one this morning - salt - my favorite.  It was very good.  The place is a bit pricey with the bagels being $1 each, but you're paying for the location and the convenience.

If you were playing in the Sports Book, I could see where you might want to go here for a quick sandwich to eat while you watched the game or race."}
{"text":"Absolouty love this place.  Everything is good especially corn beef hash.  Bagels are amazing.  Bakery is fantastic. We have been eating here every week.  Love it."}
{"text":"Our first time experience was very good! Service was great, staff was nice, food was really good, desserts were hit or miss. Definitely a place to check out for breakfast/ brunch!"}
{"text":"9 of us visited this old haunt of mine for breakfast today.  As always food was great, and plentiful.  Prices are competetive, portions generous.  Excellent coffee served here!  There were 9 of us at 10 AM, very busy but waited only 15 minutes for a table.
Receptionist was a bit offputting and unfriendly.  Service started off slow, waiting 10 minutes for coffee but once it came it flowed and they picked up The pace on service which turned out fine.  Except for the young unfriendly receptionist a good visit."}
{"text":"Apparently I'm a glutton for punishment. All your obvious problems aside you do have the best bagels in Vegas. Of course that is only true if you get the bagels you ordered. 

Stopped in for a dozen after lunch. Yes I understand it's Sunday but coming from NY I still can't believe that if a place runs out of certain flavors they don't make more. Surprisingly you had pumpernickel. Too bad you gave me a shortchanged dozen everything bagels (I ordered 2). Not surprised. I should know by now that the guys behind the counter can't count. Even if you tell them how many of each bagel. Always short 1 or 3. 


So now I really & truly am done with you. No more messed up orders. No more low quality food. No more e-coli from your undercooked frozen burger patties. No more crappy service. No more surly attitudes from counter guys. No more pathetic excuses for a manager. 

I guess I'll have bagels & pastrami again next visit to NY.

*Previous Review

I've been going to Bagel Cafe for 18 years since moving to Vegas from NY. We don't have many choices for Jewish deli here and this place has outlasted any and all competition that have opened. On average we would eat Bagel Cafe once a week until about 10 years ago. From then until last year I was taking the kids once a month & doing take-out once a month. Once in a blue moon they might have an off day. Silly things like wilted lettuce or fries that weren't crispy. The bagels and bialys were always perfect. One time they served me an obviously microwaved knish. Hot and mushy on the outside and frozen in the middle.

Recently consistency has become a huge problem. One day the food is perfect and the next not so much.

Last year while dining in the restaurant my son and I both ordered cheeseburgers, well done. Mine was raw in the center. I put everything on my burger, including the fries so I didn't notice until after I bit, chewed and swallowed & thought to myself 'that didn't taste right.' I looked and I kid you not it was raw in the center. Fortunately my son's burger was well done. I had a lovely 2 week bout with e-coli & didn't eat there for almost a year. I also didn't eat a cheeseburger again for almost a year. I didn't hold them 100% responsible as I could have cut my burger in half to check that it was cooked through. Because everyone does that. Right? But seriously though, I cook every day. Sometimes a burger or steak isn't as done as the other ones. It happens. But it isn't rocket science to push on a steak or burger to check if it's done. There is a big difference in feel between raw and well done.

One day the kids were just dying for Bagel Cafe so I took them. I ordered a cobb salad, one kid got a bagel and the other of course ordered a cheeseburger, well done. When he saw my salad he decided that we would share. Fortunately this time I cut the burger in half and it was raw. Now this indicates to me that the 'chefs' don't know what they are doing or the burgers are frozen patties. The manager removed the burger from my bill.

Today we ordered take-out. Very simple order. 1 pastrami & 2 NY knishes. Simplest thing for a deli, well in NY at least. Also I should note that I was asked if I wanted cheese, lettuce, tomato and onion on that. Drove home with the moon roof open & the hot Vegas sun on the bag. Funny thing, the sandwich was cold & the knishes were ice cold. Okay, fine. Threw the knishes in the oven. Attacked the sandwich. Now I know it's pastrami and it's fatty but it should be meat with fat on it. About 1/3 of the sandwich was sliced fat with meat on it. Couldn't even chew it. So apparently now they do not know how to cut the pastrami.

The icing on the cake: They shortchanged me on my dozen bagels. By two. Seriously, now you guys can't count?!?

I'm just done. Good bye Bagel Cafe. If I want deli I'll take a flight back home and go to Katz. It would be worth the time and money for a decent sandwich and a knish that hasn't been nuked."}
{"text":"First, let me say that their bagels are yummy!  I have only been there for lunch, as they are located in Summerlin and I live in Henderson.  I work downtown(ish), so this has been a good place to meet up with friends.  

You seat yourself and the menus are already on the table.  They have pretty fast service.  On Wednesday, I had the chicken salad sandwich on a sesame bagel.  Wow!  I was pretty impressed with their chicken salad. The potato salad and the pasta salad (side options) are just OK. The sandwich is why you are there.  

They are always busy, which is good for a local business.  I do not recommend paying your server.  Get up off your rear and pay the cashier.  Trust me, you will thank me.  It takes too long to get your change back and the servers are just too busy.  

I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Whenever I visit Las Vegas, I have to come here.  Come here you better bring your appetite cuz the portions are BIG. This place is also a deli and bakery. The shop has some delicious deli meats and large display of bake goods, the shop was buzzing with folks getting their last minute Thanksgiving goodies. 
My husband and I waited a few minutes while the wait staff clean and clear the tables.  It looks like they had a rush just before we arrived.  Once we were seated, a wait staff brought our beverage and informed us our waitress will be by soon to take our order.  10 minutes later, we were still waiting. Finally we asked another waitress to get whoever that is suppose to be our server.
Once she arrived, we ordered a Ruben and Overstuffed Tuna salad sandwich.  The order took a while to come, but they were worth the wait.  The Ruben is juicy and tender. The tuna salad had good flavor and not over mayoed. Both sandwiches were over stuffed and soooo good.  I could not even touch the fries that came with them."}
{"text":"This is one of the few places to go in Vegas for an authentic bagel! They have something like 25 different types of bagels and lots of different types of cream cheeses on a rotating basis. The best are the salmon roe, caviar, lox, and garlic cheddar! Their nova is usually really fresh and thinly sliced and the sturgeon is even better!

I also love this place for the Jewish deli. Their rye is amazing, as are all of the meats. Matzoh ball soup is decent to good. The only thing I am usually not impressed with are the desserts, but who goes to a Jewish deli for the desserts?

The ambiance is very cute - looks like a traditional Jewish deli and the menu is on a newspaper. Sometimes it gets very busy, but once seated, the food comes really quickly. It's also a great place for takeout!"}
{"text":"Great for bagels and cream cheese.  Go for the herb cream cheese spread.  They give tons of, it watch out."}
{"text":"Yummy bagels found here!  Soft chewy freshly baked and great friendly speedy service.

If you're going to pick a place for breakfast in this hood, come here. You will find an elderly crowd but it's near Sun City so don't be shocked. 

There's plenty of seating and a great deli style menu with lots to choose from for breakfast and lunch. 

I had a veggie omelet with a bagel and the bagel was toasted served with cream cheese.  My omelet was a bit overdone but the potatoes were made with peppers, onions and paprika were full of flavor.  I liked the coffee too.

The bakery had plenty of bagels to choose from and lots of other sweet treats that you could get to-go if you don't want to stay and eat.

If you're looking for that special deli, I think this is it!"}
{"text":"4-stars!

The Bagel Cafe is probably one of the only places in Las Vegas that comes close to being an authentic NY type deli eatery.  Must be, because this place is constantly packed full of folks!  East coast natives abound, I hear that 'Noo Yawkeh' accent on every other table!  Works for me!  As long as the food is good.

For what it's worth, The Bagel Cafe doesn't disappoint.  Matzo ball soup?  Get outa hea!  Bagels and lox?  Ahrite ahready!  Hand-cut deli sandwich with pickles?  Fawget aboutit!  All represented here plus much more!  I can't believe I've lived here so long and within a 10 minute drive from this place, should've been here sooner to eat!  Now we will probably visit on a monthly basis whenever the need comes for a big @$$ deli sandwich.

The Bagel Cafe is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner on most days, but you will see that breakfast and lunch are their busiest times.  Want to eat there on the weekend for brunch?  Be careful of the time, the wait can be a bit long!  But if you're looking for good deli eats, the wait is worth it.  They're friendly, but they work quick!  You gotta be on your toes.  Don't give an attitude, because you just might get one back!  These New Yorkers don't take no $hi+!  Keep that in mind and you'll be fine.

The breakfast/lunch crowd is gigantic but there are a lot of open spaces, except for maybe ONE.  Word is power couple Mayor Goodman and former mayor...ahem...Mayor Goodman, frequent The Bagel Cafe often and even have their own empty table waiting for them.  They must really like the place to have their own little spot!  Lucky.  Guess the rest of us non-mayors just have to wait like everyone else.

Food overall looks delicious though and many reviews confirm this.  Pancakes and challah French toast are huge.  Potato pancakes and Eggs Benedict look fresh and hearty.  Omelets, damn they are pretty good in size.  As much as I love breakfast though, I go straight for the deli sandwiches.  Go big or go home!  Most sandwiches come in either the 1/4 pound size (for you little babies), or 1/2 pound size (for us big babies).  They all come with pickles, and your choice of potato salad, macaroni salad, pasta salad, coleslaw, or chips.  Some good eats-a-comin'!

I enjoy building my own sandwich, and often end up with a 1/2 pound behemoth of corned beef and pastrami on rye.  No wheat for me folks!  Give me that sucker, spread on some yellow mustard or the house brown mustard, and I'm ready to go!  I'll pound that 1/2 pound till she is no more!  Luckily there's not too much bread to get in your way of succulent meat.  The Thurmann's meats they use at The Bagel Cafe are of great quality, the seasoning for me on the corned beef and pastrami are just right.  Bright, briny, and peppery.  Damn delicious.

Now, sandwiches are not allowed to be shared at The Bagel Cafe (watch out they will charge you for sharing that), so they have a build your own sandwich platter made for TWO people (or one lucky piggy).  For the sandwich platter you get your choice of bread, choice of two sides, a slew of fresh pickled veggies, lettuce, tomato, onion, choice of cheese, and just over 1/2 pound of up to three deli meats!  Sandwich platter of epic proportions!  Last time around the wifey and I chose corned beef, pastrami, and roast beef.  Yep, we overdid it just a tad.  So much food!  Best part?  This platter comes in at under $20!  We had enough to feed the two of us, plus share a bunch of deli cuts with the kids!  You can choose whatever deli meats you like on the menu, I hear the roast turkey and the tongue (yes - unctuous beef tongue) are good choices as well.

The Bagel Cafe also does authentic deli dinners - classic choices like lamb shank, stuffed cabbage, liver and onions, and chopped steak.  I will have to be back for dinner one day!  For now, I am more than happy with a fatty deli sandwich.

If you can't dine in, The Bagel Cafe will gladly do take-out, they have a full service bakery and deli on the opposite side of the dining room.  Need a dozen bagels for home, or a large side of NY cheesecake?  All this can be had and more, no big wait.  

Get some chutzpah and bring your butts over here to The Bagel Cafe!  Don't be a friggin' putz!

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Another delightful lunch.  Mmmmmm.  Food is good here.  

Branched out and had a spinach, feta and sun dried tomato pizza bagel today.  Good choice!!! It was loaded with fresh toppings including tons of cheese and gorgeous spinach.  I would definitely order this again.

I also got some fries.  They were good too.  

Service was a bit off, as usual.... asking for things repeatedly, but ended up with everything we needed eventually.  Everyone was was nice and friendly.  I guess the service adds to the \"New York\" style deli atmosphere."}
{"text":"This bagel cafe bears no resemblance, menu or otherwise, to the other location. 

That said, if you want a tasty bagel in the middle of the sports book, this is a great stop. 

We stopped in for sustenance during our Sunday bike ride. The prices are high, the ambiance is low, and the food takes a bit longer than expected. The bagels are chewy fluffy and delicious. I had a bagel, egg, sausage, and cheddar sandwich. I think it ended up costing $6- so with my husband and 2 drinks we spent over $22. That's a bit much for counter service bagels. 

I'd pop back for a bagel in a pinch - but would go to the original bagel cafe for the better experience."}
{"text":"What makes the Bagel Cafe an authentic New York Deli?? They'll say it's the food, which may be true but the real reason if you listen carefully is there are many different languages being spoken. Three I could recognize (English, Spanish, Israeli) and two I could not, but one sounded Russian. So apparently the Bagel Cafe is like a mini melting pot like New York. Food was good as always!"}
{"text":"Came here to dine in for the first time (We had ordered soups and pastry from the deli counter prior to this). Sat ourselves and were greeted immediately. Server was friendly and brought bagel chips with pesto cream cheese. A few pickles would be a nice touch on those plates. 

We ordered the Matzoh Ball Soup and a Corned Beef Reuben. Both were very delicious. Reuben was a very nice portion compared to most places in town. Corned beef was flavorful and lean. Only downfall was they wouldn't let us upgrade to a small salad in lieu of the mac salad for a small price. Also, the server told us we couldn't order more broth for our leftover soup to go. Said we had to order another cup of soup?!? Ended up charging us for a bowl to go and only brought us a cup portion. Just charge us a couple bucks for some more broth and be done with it. It's really quite a turn off. Don't alienate your customers by penny pinching. Although we will be back. Probably only for carry out next time."}
{"text":"I had the corned beef hash and a bagel. I loved both. The corned beef has was unbelievable and the bagel was nice and not too chewy but just enough. The service was also outstanding and food came out quick. Make sure you try a bagel when you eat here!"}
{"text":"I am a fan!  A big fan of many years.  It has to do with the quality of of the breakfast (I am actually not sure if I have ever actually had anything other than breakfast. Hum?).  Anyway, a great omelet and the perfect everything bagel to accompany that great omelet...all 100+ times I have consumed it! LOL!  The spinach and feta is kind of my favorite.   

After a hard workout when I am seeking to get a solid, great meal inside me, the Bagel Cafe is the reward.  

I have ordered pies for the Thanksgiving holiday as well over the last dozen years. 

This place is not fancy and can often be busy and slammed."}
{"text":"The name is appropriate because their bagels are awesome!  I have been here numerous times for bagels and to dine in.  My favorite is the garlic bagel (toasted) with the green olive and pimento spread and if you get what you ordered to go and it's accurate (and it's not always this way), then life is good!  Everything else in my experience has been mediocre - including the service at the deli counter, the wait time, the ambiance, the parking/access to the place, etc.  

Now, back to the bagels... I did say they were awesome - and they are!  So, if you're looking for a great bagel, in fact, the best bagel in town in my opinion, then this place has exactly what you're looking for."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast.  Bagel was good, too, and I'm not a bagel fan. Impressive bakery selection."}
{"text":"I think this is a great place for what it is - a New York style diner. 
It's always fun to come here for breakfast, dishes are big, desserts are great and we can take with us bagels, Hala bread, cakes :) 
I wouldn't say it's a five star place, food and service are just fine but not exceptional."}
{"text":"Review is for deli: Love this place! When we want a quick and light breakfast we go to the deli and order a couple bagels with cream cheese,  the scallion cream cheese has huge pieces of real scallion in it.  They have a good variety of bagels, I usually get an asiago or cheddar jalepeno bagel.   I also picked up at least 2 items from the pastry side also.   At least 2 pieces of the rainbow cookie ( which is more of cake bites than cookie) and either rice pudding,  black & white cookie or maybe a roll.   When you order these to go, the LG cookie and Cinnamon roll is big enough to fill a lg take out container.  They are huge! Tip:  Know what want to order by the time it's your turn, this is a busy and fast paced deli so do your research and look at a menu because it can get a little overwhelming if it's your first trip."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place for years and always told myself I'd come here, now that I've been here I'm kicking myself in the ass for not coming here sooner!  Located inside a business complex near the Buffalo freeway exit, the Bagel Cafe is a charming family owned breakfast joint that's been around for 20 years.  When you first walk in, you're instantly greeted by the glorious sight of bagels and homemade cream cheese that they have. You can also buy the bagels here separately too.  Came here on a Sunday morning around 8:15 am and was able to find a table no problem.  Here you seat yourself to an open table and a server will be by shortly to wait on you.  The servers who waited on us were attentive and friendly too.  The dining area itself is large and clean with two different sections. 

My friend and I ordered:
-Biscuits and Gravy ($7.95) - Wow I seriously was not expecting this dish to be so good!  The buttermilk biscuits were nice and fluffy, not dry at all like biscuits can tend to be sometimes.  At first glance the dish looks like they put wayyyy too much gravy on top, but Bagel Cafe clearly knows what they are doing and put the right amount on, not soggy at all.     
-2 oz. Smoked Fish Platter ($11.95) - I was a little scared that this wouldn't fill me up but I totally underestimated it!  Comes with fish of your choice, I picked the smoked salmon, and it also comes with tomato, red onion, cucumber, olives, and a bagel and cream cheese of your choice.  I got the everything bagel with plain cream cheese.  I loved this!  I also think compared to other lox bagels I've had this is about mid-range price...not the cheapest but not the most expensive either.   
-Side of Homefries ($2.95) - Tasty and seasoned pretty well but I did think this was a bit on the mushy side. 

My friend and I can't stop raving to each other about how good this place is.  Now that I know how awesome this place is I will definitely be back.  A great breakfast dining experience all around!"}
{"text":"When you think it's just a bagel place but it's so much more!!  I'm so glad we decided to have brunch here!!  Although I've never been to the East coast I feel this place would fit right in!  I love all the freshly baked breads and desserts that they have.  I also love that you can order deli style or sit in the restaurant.  Now me and the bestie had decided to have brunch before starting our day.  When we arrived at the café at first I was like hmmmmm this looks like a business complex, which it was.  I was a bit envious of these people because they got to eat here everyday.  So we entered the café and were sat at a table quite quickly.  Surprisingly as busy as they were our drink order was taken very quickly.  We checked over the menu and anytime I come to a new place it's always hard for me to choose or go with favorites or with what the regulars get.  Because well you just never know. So anytime I want to gage a new place I always get something that is easy and simple.  I only do this because I want to see how a place makes the easiest thing on their menu.  So I got the typical everyday breakfast of bacon and eggs along with a bagel and cream cheese.  Let me tell you the food is amazing and the bagels are huge!  The bacon was just how I like it, nice and crispy and the eggs were wonderful.  Not runny or undercooked.  I really enjoyed my breakfast and without a doubt one of the best I've had.
Now onto the bakery!!!  Now I'm always a sucker for a good and delicious baked good and this café does not disappoint.  There are tons of items to choose from.  Now had I not had to travel on a plane I would have bought a few loaves of bread both regular and sweet and some cinnamon rolls, but unfortunately I don't trust my food to anyone else so maybe next time.  So I settled for a couple of Black & White cookies, which are my second favorite to chocolate chip.  Let me tell you those cookies didn't last till my trip home because I just couldn't.  
All in all I'd say I would definitely make the trip back here the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ordinarily I am the cheap-o kind of guy that would scoff at the mere thought of paying $26 for a meal for one person.  So why is it that I am absolutely fine with paying that much at Bagel Cafe?  Because I got more than just one meal out of the food I ordered.  

I saw stuffed cabbage on the menu uder \"Starters\" so I thought I would start with that.  I also had made up my mind on a pastrami reuben.  Little did I know that the cabbage would come out the size of a small baby and be served with a whole bagel.  As soon as the cabbage came to my table I knew I was in trouble.  I joked with the waitress that I may need a to-go box before the day was over.  When she saw the glazed over look in my eyes when the sandwich came, she looked at me and said \"Yeah, you're gonna need a box.  Let me know when you're ready.\" 

The cabbage was hands down the best I've ever had.  It was tender enough to eat with a spoon.  There was no choking down of tough cabbage leaves.  The sauce was tomato perfection.  The meatloaf within was formed well and held its shape better than mama can make it do.  I could have and perhaps even should have made a meal of just the cabbage.  But no, I had to get the sandwich too.

 The sandwich was what I have been searching for in Las Vegas for years.  Pastrami stacked higher than my mouth will allow in and covered in gooey melty cheese, soaked with dressing and topped with crunchy and mild sauerkraut.  It was a magnificant sight to behold.  The battered fries, macaroni salad and pickle spear on the plate all added to the feast.  

At the time of my surrender I had eaten half of the cabbage, half of the bagel, half of my reuben, the macaroni salad and a few fries.  I thought I might need a wheel chair to roll my fat butt back to the car.  With my leftovers I ended up with no less than two more meals.  One meal was the remainder of the cabbage and bagel.  The other was the reuben and fries for lunch the following day.  With that, my $26 meal soon turned into three and, at a more resonable $8 and change per, was easier to justify."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food is excellent.  I am a New Yorker and this is the closest to Jewish NY food and all of my favorites that Ive had outside of NY.  That being said, I am upset with this place.  I keep coming back since I love the food but each time I do, I remember why it takes me so long to come again.  The servers are typically not nice.  They do not wait on me promptly and are rude.  And its a passive aggressive kind of rude with a fake smile.  I have had one nice server and thats it.  Most times, it takes them forever to even come over initially. The tables are consistently not well bussed either.  One time I was here there were crumbs on the chair.  I asked for it to be wiped down politely and was told that they are not supposed to wipe the chairs (huh?).  I totally didn't get that so questioned it and she said it isn't good for the seats and that \"it is only crumbs\" and then wiped it.  Seriously- for the prices of food here, one is entitled to sit on a clean chair and not in someone else's mess.  Especially since the price for several items goes up when you sit versus get it at the counter.  I also didn't appreciate bones in the whitefish salad last I ate it though I understand it happens."}
{"text":"This review is for their bakery side, not the sit down restaurant . . . as we did not eat there, but just picked up some pastries and bagels to go!

There aren't many superb salt bagels, I'm talking the good ones with the white granules all over the bagel - not the combination - but the fresh white salt granules! Yum!  This place has it amongst 20 other types of bagels.  There are also a myriad of cream cheeses, some beyond the norm which was a nice option! 

Muffins and danishes were fresh and delicious - according to the hubby, he is a fan as well.  Their baked goods and bagels are definitely fresh - no question - and soft! 

They are not cheap - we paid $14 for 4 bagels with cream cheese on 3 and butter on one.  I believe there is a \"cut/slice\" fee as well.  However, if you are in the mood for a good, damn good bagel, you will find it here! 

Service - we stood in front of the \"order here\" sign for a good 8 minutes before being acknowledged.  There were at least 4 people walking around behind the counter, but I guess we were invisible?  I'm not sure how you missed us - we were a party of 2 adults with 4 little girls in ballet clothes, giggling and starving?!!

Anyway, we left happy and their bagels, muffins and pastries are legit!  And almost . . . . ALMOST worth the wait."}
{"text":"Hi I give this place Two stars because the waitress was really nice. But the pastrami was soooo dry and Cold . Was not worth looking for a parking space . Parking is terrible there. 
Price was high . To half sandwiches and two drinks $35. My friend and told me about is place. I wish she didn't. Will Never come Back!!!"}
{"text":"Hopeful...bite, chew, swallow....Meh. 
Bite again, chew again,.... Meh. Darn! 

Had such high expectations (since I am from New York / Long Island) and have known the joy of real Bagel shops. 
Really, Bagel Cafe- your photos are beautiful...your presentation enticing....

You had me at Hamentashen! 
But you left me at the booth by the window with a mouth full of Meh.

SERVICE:
Counter help (women) are not very cordial and seem disinterested in helping or answering questions.
Stood there for a while as they just ignored me making their own coffee and being snobby. This is a service business; shouldn't you make people feel comfortable when they come through the door? And it wasn't just the way we were treated. Watched as other patrons got similar cold attitude. IMHO

Deli counter staff (men) are nice, helpful  and engaged. 

One waitress - over worked...but cordial. 

FOOD / BAGELS : GENERALLY GREAT
Coffee is good.
Bagels are great.
Lots of Cream cheese options and things to put with Bagels abound.
There is an emphasis on real traditional Jewish food which I really appreciate finding in LV! But although the Bagel Cafe has a niche market and offers loads of variety.....

FOOD/ OTHER:
Ordered a feta spinach omelet. It came with a glob of feta in one spot. Feta was sour, melted, not Greek- style. Too much grease or butter used in cooking. 

Muffins are large, lovely, but oddly lacking in flavor.

Took some other pastries home and found them OK, none are \"wonderful\"- taste is rather bland - not exciting in the mouth.
Eating a bite of cranberry muffin as I write...chew, swallow, try it once more, Nope, still Meh! 

Overall, not sure we'd eat here again. 

Might get bagels and cream cheese to go. 
If I HAD to.

Wish it was better experience. Has promise, but it just seemed like they are missing something .... like interpersonal  warmth and flavorful food. 

Give it a try, anyway. You might find it better than I did-?...hopefully."}
{"text":"I always like the 4oz lox plate with everything bagel. They have great desserts also."}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely a hidden gem located around 20 minutes northwest of the Vegas Strip. We dropped by for a quick brunch, not knowing how long we were going to spend at Red Rock Canyon. I knew a lot of  people in the area rave about this place so I definitely had to try it out. It was packed to the brim on a Tuesday morning, which shocked me! They have everything from sandwiches to meats to breads and of course everyone's favorite, their pastries. Service was so/so but I would understand because the restaurant was so busy. There are newspapers in the front that look like daily news but it is actually their gigantic menu so it took us awhile for us to decide what we wanted. 

I ended up getting their Smoked Turkey with Avocado, Tomato, and Bacon, which only comes in the bigger half pound portions. Be warned because I was expecting a small bite but their sandwiches are huge and is pretty much 1.5x meals for me but there is absolutely no sharing! Their turkey was a little dry but I'm glad they didn't skimp on the amount of turkey they gave. I was surprised that they gave a pickle beside the sandwich because I'm a huge fan of pickles but I only ended up eating half of it because of how salty it was. With the sandwich, you have a choice of a side, which I chose potato salad and it was on the creamier side, which I didn't mind.  Overall, busy staff so don't expect good service but the food makes up for it!"}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB when it comes to getting an authentic bagel & smear.  Yummy!  I hit it a few times a month."}
{"text":"This is where I wish yelp offered half stars. Overall this venue is clean, pleasant and efficent. It's a seat yourself venue and for those ordering to go you go up to the deli counter and place your order. Works well enough. Now on to the details

Selections = 5 stars!
Holy cow do they have a ton of selections! The bakery alone is something to rejoiced about. Most importantly they carry black and white cookies!!! As a former New Yorker black and white cookies bring back some fond memories. I have not found one place here in Las Vegas that carries them. The same goes for Knishes! I didnt buy them this trip but I have every intention to do so at my next. Again Knishes are one of those that brings back some happy memories and I can never find here in Vegas.

Food = 3 stars
Whenever someone tells me this taste just like New York something, I get a little suspcious. Nothing taste like New York anything unless you're in New York, simply put its the water! Bagels are boiled in water, its the water. So, having read reviews and many new yorker transplant raving about the bagels I knew I had to try it. My thoughts? I'm okay with it. It doesn't have that chewiness of the NYC bagel. Its missing this je ne sais quoi. Is it bad? No its delicopis, but its not exciting me and making me dance. I also got the matza ball soup, okay that was good! Can we say hugs the soul? The mataz balls are light and fluffy and savory. Lastly the white and black cookie, it taste like a cake! The frosting was good, but the cookie itself needed maybe 3 minutes more in the oven. 

Overall, I'll definitely go back. Need to try all the other goodies."}
{"text":"This is a local's favorite. Anyone and everyone who came from the east coast can't say enough about this place. 

Today I went for lunch. I ordered half a sandwich with the soup de jour - cabbage with tuna salad on toasted sourdough. 

I expected Cabbage soup like the diet type. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived it was a rich, thick, tomatoey broth, ground beef, and shredded cabbage. The cabbage was tender but still firm enough to have a great texture. It was flavorful. In my own personal opinion, it was just a little too sweet. Sugar offsets the acidity of the tomato base and it is strictly personal preference.

The tuna salad sandwich was, of course, stacked high and offered with lettuce tomato and onion. I ordered it with just lettuce and it came with a huge green Romaine lettuce leaf on top of pleasantly chunky albacore tuna-perfectly toasted sourdough. It had the perfect amount of mayo and was seasoned mildly. 

Service was good, even though it was busy. On the way out, I couldn't help but stop at the deli and take home coconut cake and tiramisu!  Both scrumptious. 

This place did not disappoint."}
{"text":"So normally this is my favorite place to eat but the past 2 times I ordered take out it was wrong and the guys taking the order were really rude. He took my order and when he read it back it was wrong. When I corrected him, he waved his hand at me and walked away.  Another employee had to go talk to him and explain he was wrong. Not cool"}
{"text":"This is a great Italian deli.  Everyone here was so nice and very helpful.  A very large menu and bagel and dessert selection.  

My wife ordered some bagels for her workdays and some cream cheese.  They have 7 different cream cheese selections. The bagels are soft and have lots of flavor.  We got green olive and herb cream cheese.  Both were outstanding. 

We also ordered lunch.  She ordered the two meat sandwich with Hebrew National salami and bologna.  Wow we're those two meats good.  We already love the hot dogs, the salami and bologna are just as good.  I ordered the Reuben with corned beef and pastrami.  Very crispy buttery bread, good sauerkraut, and 1000 island dressing.  Best rueben I have had in Vegas so far.  I will be back for it again. 

The dessert case had a lot to choose from.  We got a black and white cookie, a homemade Twinkie and some other pastries.  All were really good. 

I would recommend this deli to anyone.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"I've had some very good breakfast in this place. I think the staff is very friendly and always filling up your coffee cup. My favorite is the Salmon Benedict It was delicious. I miss this place can't wait to get back to Vegas so I can go back."}
{"text":"Well...when I've been wanting to eat here for quite a while since it has been listed as a Best of Las Vegas restaurant.  It was very busy in here as well so I had high hopes.  Let me start out by saying they have many choices for lunch which looked great.  The hot dog with Chili, Cheese and Onion spoke to me so I ordered that and it comes with French fries as well as a choice of Macaroni salad, potato salad or cucumber salad.  My husband got the Pastrami sandwich on Rye, which looks huge on the menu.  

Our food took about 25 minutes to get (something that is listed on the menu that I overlooked when ordering), unfortunately when it arrived I was highly disappointed with the first bite that I took.  When you order a hot dog with Chili you expect a hot steaming hot dog and chili.  Mine was cold.  The cheese that was put on it was a torn up cheddar cheese slice that wasn't even melted so that means when they put the hot dog together it was luke warm or cold to start out with.  The only plus was the french fries were nice and hot and crispy.  The potato salad had no flavor and unfortunately the pickle that came with the plate was sub par and kinda gross.  

My husband received his pastrami and it was dry and not nearly as big as they advertise.  

When walking out we decided to go look at the desserts and the bagels.  They look amazing but this place is all about nickel and diming you.  The menu states no sharing, there is a split plate fee of $2.00.  Also, if you want to order a bagel and cream cheese make sure you ask for a whole one other wise it is a $1.00 charge to cut it for you.  

I don't see myself going back to this place, the food wasn't all that great and I don't like having  \"extra\" charges for things that should come as part of the service; ex: slicing a bagel so I can eat it at the table."}
{"text":"After our normal weekly Saturday breakfast spot recently closed, we were on the hunt for a new spot. One of the people in our group raved about how good The Bagel Cafe was and we should start going there.

Today was my first visit and will be the last!

We were at our table for more than 15 minutes before a \"bus girl\" with a bad attitude and no name tag walked over and said \"What do you want to drink?\" Not even a hello, welcome, etc. When she brought our drinks she spilled scalding hot coffee on the arm of someone at our table and not even an apology. Completely unbelievable!!

It was another 10+ minutes before our server came to take our order. Quite a long time when the restaurant wasn't even half full. From the time we walked in the door until our food was on our table was 55 minutes. Not acceptable.

I ordered the corned beef hash and eggs platter. It was just okay. I asked for over medium eggs and received soft poached. The fruit cup that was substituted instead of potatoes was 2 chunky pieces of pineapple and 2 chunky pieces of honeydew melon. The bagel and cream cheese was good. 

Overall I didn't think it was worth the total of $17.27 + tip.  I'll be happy NOT to spend my money there again."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since 2005. The genuinely have the best bagels in Las Vegas, maybe the best bagels anywhere.  The array of the menu items and the bakery is quite extensive and always fresh and delicious!  Love the Bagel Cafe !!"}
{"text":"The food was great.  The only reason why I gave it three stars was, we wanted to sample a taste of tuna salad and the server said no. We asked why?  She said, people take advantage of it.  We asked for sample because there are so many variations of it.  This has been the only restaurant that would not give us a taste. The description the server gave us was salt pepper and celery and mayo.  HeLLO!!!  Really"}
{"text":"So far everything I've tried has been really good. 

- Corned Beef Hash (AMAZING!)
- Ruben (Delish!)
- Roast Beef Sandwich (YUM!)
- Grilled Cheese with Tomato and Bacon (You had me at Bacon!)"}
{"text":"Wow, really enjoyed this place, so much that we went back to back days on our trip to Vegas.
The bagels were some of the best I've had and the cheddar jalapeño smear was just superb. Also had the scallion smear which was also amazing.
The bakery section just all looked fantastic and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to spots when I cant decide on the weekends when I want to go out. For some reason I enjoy this loud, busy, and packed place. Which is always a good thing when your looking for some place to eat right? They have a easy menu and if they don't offer what you want they will work with you. The nova spread with a  garlic bagel is my all time choice along with the mushroom and cheddar omelet which I get \"customized\". Generally there is a wait time but they normally seat before the time they give you, which gives you a chance to browse around their deli and bakery area- from cheesecake to canolis to giant cookies (peanut butter, chocolate chip, m&m just to make a few) to tiramisu, they basically have everything."}
{"text":"Loved this place. The food was reasonably priced and tasty. They have a deli with all kinds of delicious baked goods, meats, and cheeses. I've never been to NY but it's what I imagine it's what a NY deli would be. We'll be back"}
{"text":"No flavor. Shared regular breakfast and turkey club sammich. Niether has any flavor. Can imagine any of their other food being any different   Maybe they have good deli but restaurant side is no good."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast; so delicious and great fast service! Bagels are perfection with freshly whipped cream cheese with about 30 varieties of bagels (all freshly baked on site), omelettes are huge! I had Nova Omlette with onions that was just perfect. My husband and I were so impressed we will be coming back many times over! The place gets busy but if you come before 9am you should not have any wait time."}
{"text":"This restaurant seemed a little clustered with many different things.  First you have the bakery, and then you have the seating area for brunch.  Now I was highly disappointed with the service, overall I felt I had to wait a little longer than you usually should.  First off, I don't think any restaurant should have a seat yourself option.  Unless you are ordering from the cashier service yourself and then seating yourself, this should never EVER be an option.  It took about 20 minutes for our server to come and get our order, and it took another 30 mins for our food to come.  So overall, almost an hour to actually eat and order which is something I don't find lightly.  I think the girl near the bakery section felt bad for us so she came and got our order, which I found nice of her.  

Aside from the clustered and noisy ambience, the food was ok.  My boyfriend and I ordered the crab eggs benedict, french toast, and the biscuits and gravy with a side of eggs and sausage.  

The crabs benedict was good, I think I got way too much meat I didn't even find the bread at the bottom of it.  The flavors were all there though.  I wasn't too fond of the potatoes, I thought it was mushy and to weird of a spice for me. 

The french toast was good, a little thick cut and huge but I understand the big serving idea.  I think I needed a little more syrup instead of the small side they gave me.  The bread was really thick, I think more syrupy sweets would do it justice.

The biscuits and gravy was ok, personally I thought it was too light.  I actually like the biscuits and gravy from south point which is rather odd.  But I thought they had more flavor.  

Overall this place was ok, I don't think I'll be returning soon because of that clustered feeling.  On top of that I paid $43.00 for everything which I thought was little too pricey.  I could've gone to egg works and paid less than that, but hey that's just me."}
{"text":"Easily the best bagel shop in Vegas.  They have the most delicious bagels and I can't help but order one and walk out with a dozen to take home.  They have wonderful housemade cream cheeses and i love eating their pastries.  Everyone who likes bagels should try them, becuase you will start to LOVE bagels like me!"}
{"text":"Being use to Delis from Detroit plus I am critical of delis in general. Bagel Cafe is as good as it gets.  Pastrami and Corned Beef are as good as I've had anywhere.  Same goes for the lox.  Bagels are good for Las Vegas but nothing like I am use to from Detroit. Great Black n Whites too."}
{"text":"Oh yes, I like Bagel Cafe a lot! When first coming here, I was surprised to see the well sized dining area. I expected it to be a lot smaller but it turns out it's more just a cafe with bagels. Lot's of sweet treats, deli selections, and hot plates are also offered. The bagels though, are legit. My go-to spot for sure.
I had a pretty good Matza Ball Soup as one of my first selections. Hearty and flavorful, perfect for chilly days. 
I also tried the meat kinish and potato pancake - both pretty good BUT not how my mom would make them... Mom's is always better :)
My absolute favorite here is the strawberry cheesecake. So damn good! Fresh, fluffy, and not overly sweet - delicious! I have been wanting to try other sweets but it's been hard to not get the cheesecake. It just calls my name! 
I did try a jam cookie sandwich with powdered sugar on top and it was pretty good.
The one thing I have not been able to catch here is the bialy's. They are always gone by the time I get here :( One day I will try them... I will just have to keep coming back ;)"}
{"text":"Went here this morning with my family because they live here in Vegas and love this place! They enjoyed their half sandwiches and bowls of matzoball soup's. I got the challah bread french toast and unfortunately it was very dry without taste. The bakery items looked amazing though. Didn't try any, but I definitely will next time. I'm hopeful the food will be yummier on my future visit... PS. we got here at 12:45 pm and there was a little bit of a wait, but nothing like California deli's on the weekends. Look on the board for specials because server didn't mention them and after we got our food, my cousin pointed out the lemon ricotta pancakes on the board... Nooooo, I definitely would have ordered those if I had seen them first.... 8("}
{"text":"Parking is an issue as it is in an office / business complex. But I'm not reviewing the parking. This place is awesome! We got the smoked fish platter for 2, could have fed 4 easily. The Lox are sliced very thin, as they should be. The bagels are what you would expect from a traditional deli, not the type from a chain.
We also split a bowl of matzo ball soup. It was chock full of chicken, noodles, big slices of carrots and two good size matzo balls. This will be a normal stop for us when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Okay, I judge a Kosher style deli by their Matzo Ball soup. A REAL and proper way to cook the broth is with a chicken carcass, sauté some onions, chop up a couple of stalks of celery and several quartered carrots. This is the traditional way a broth for Matzo balls is made. NOT with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in. When done, it should be a clear broth with just the carrots and celery floating around. Maybe in a pinch some dill thrown in for measure.
Real Matzo Balls are made with a binder of schmalz (rendered chicken fat for you goyim out there). 
I found the entire bowl to be uninspiring, with tasteless Matzo balls, and with all sorts of flotsam floating in the bowl.
Remember: this is NOT a diet food, which brings me to the corned beef....
Corned beef should be served with a thick layer of fat on it....this is where all the flavor is, and is once again..NOT a diet food. If you don't like the fat simply remove it from your sandwich. 
I don't care for their practice of cutting it all off prior to reaching my table! If I was concerned about the saturated fats I wouldn't be eating any of this in the first place.

I have even gone as far as requesting a lot of extra fat, and it always comes to my table, trimmed and tasteless.
Without this rich flavor it changes from Corned beef to peppered beef. Completely altering the taste and drying the meat out.

I know most everybody being so health conscious these days would disagree with me, but for old die hards like me the old fashioned way, really is the best.

If I want decent corned beef from now on, I'll make my own.

You really cannot find an authentic place in this town, and having lived here for years, I speak from experience.

My Bubbe would be rolling in her grave..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I'm not a big fan of breakfast food, but this place draws me in.  They have a wide selection of fresh made bagels and cream cheese.  A great bakery.  I lover there sandwiches (try the French dip).  Also, they have Matzah Ball Soup.  The parking is terrible.  There are not enough spaces and they spaces are too small.  The prices are a tad high, but still very reasonable.  The menus are made to look like newspapers.  Go for the bakery if nothing else and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"HUGE PORTIONS!! Great to get take out...and just eat somewhere else, seeing as how it is ALWAYS busy!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Tons of fresh chunk chicken in the chicken soup.  Pastrami was delicious - some of the best I ever had.  Service was A+.  Will definitely go back.  By the way I didn't have dessert but they are lined up in a case and looked great."}
{"text":"This is my new go-to place for lunch. I can attribute my 10 lbs weight gain in one week to visiting this gem 3 days in a row.  Why so frequent? Pastrami Pastrami Pastrami! 

This is as close to the holy grail of Katz's Pastrami Sandwich (in New York) as I've come across in Las Vegas. I'm talking thick + juicy, melt in your mouth Pastrami between two think slices of bread. The pastrami taste like real meat because it's actually cut out of a hunk meat slow cooked to near perfection. None of this fake jello-y dry salty pastrami you see packaged at the store. I'm salivating as I write this review. 

Finish your meal with a giant Black and White cookie and you have yourself 10 miles to run on the treadmill. But boy is it worth it."}

{"text":"I went here with some of our good friends from Israel and they were talking about the Challah french toast. Yum. Huge portions, good tea, lots of baked treats. It was super packed and worth the wait. We're fans."}
{"text":"Friendly but slow staff. Maybe it was a fluke, after all, this was my first time coming in. I have had better bagels elsewhere as well."}
{"text":"The bagels are good. Nice chew to them. Usual breakest fair, omelets, spreads, they do a brisk business of take out lunch sandwiches which makes sense in Florida because there's no deli's to go to. Service is good. Looking for a good bagel, you should try this place.
- One thing I can't figure out is why are there no Egg bagels in Florida? You can get them in every bagel store in the entire north east. Come to Florida, nada.  But, this place has chocolate chip bagels but no egg bagels, like there's a huge demand for chocolate bagels? Whoever decides to makes egg bagels will get all the ex north easterners business, Just saying."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bagel spot in Las Vegas.
I'm from Connecticut, so I used to take the train to NYC often. That being said, I know a good bagel! I have been trying to hunt down the perfect bagel here in Vegas for a while now and I think this is it. 

First off, i'd like to state that this place is a hidden gem. LITERALLY. It took us about 5 minutes to hunt it down in the parking lot! (Hint, its to the left of the Omelet House!)

They serve fresh bagels in different flavors, but me being a \"plain jane\" type I stick to plain. They also have different cream cheese flavors like plain, scallion, strawberry, veggie, etc. 
Again, i'm very plain jane so i get plain or scallion! They have different sandwiches and meats/cheeses but I have yet to try them! There's also a variety of cookies and even coffee cake (YUM!).

The place is never really busy (at least whenever i'm there) so we get our pick of tables to sit at. The wait isn't too long, maybe 5 minutes tops. I also think the staff is great here, very friendly and always have smiles on their faces. 

Now I don't know about you, but I LOVE cream cheese. These guys give you a hefty portion of cream cheese when serving you and I love it!!! My boyfriend is the complete opposite, he likes very, very, very light cream cheese. Craaazy right? 
Anyways, I appreciate a warm toasted bagel with lots of cream cheese-y goodness :)
I have also tried their breakfast sandwich and its soooo good! Perfect greasy egg goodness with cheese and bacon on a toasted bagel....YES! I recommend this place to everyone. It's my favorite bagel spot, and reminds me of home. :)"}
{"text":"My husband is from New York and knows his bagels-- so I was definitely happy to hear that this is the closest to a New York bagel he has ever had on the West Coast. My husband likes simplicity so you definitely can't go wrong with a plain, toasted bagel and cream cheese. Personally I'm a fan of their Sundried Tomato and basil bagel with Nova Lox. MMM Mmmm!

They pack on the cheese in the familiar NYC deli style. They also have a bakery reminiscent of Italian bakeshops in Little Italy. I have yet to try their sit down cafe but am definitely excited to come back because I doubt there will be any disappointment. 

Side note- the service definitely reminded me of authentic NY style quick dining which I appreciated. It's a \"KNOW WHAT YOU WANT BEFORE YOU GET TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE BC WE GOT LINES OF CUSTOMERS\" type attitude which I can dig. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this little gem. They always bring delicious bagel chips with a special cream cheese. All the servers I've had have been extremely friendly. The menu has a vast offering and everything I've had I've thoroughly enjoyed. Their potato pancakes are excellent!"}
{"text":"Located off of Buffalo. Parking is tight but I usually can get in and out. This place always has people, especially on Saturday morning. Dine in or ToGo. I typically take mine ToGo. 

I love coming here and grabbing breakfast. I order two eggs scrambled with cheese. You can have this alone, or with bacon, sausage, ham steak or Canadian bacon. I usually get a sausage link. You also have a choice of toast or a bagel. They have a great selection on bagels. 

Very decent breakfast. Nice generous portions. 

At the deli I love the kosher dill pickles! 

I've also indulged on turkey pastrami sandwich for lunch - loved it. Lots of meat, nice size sandwich. 

Great quality food and did I mention the mouth watering delicious bakery set up! Everything from cookies, cakes, pies etc. I've never had a lemon bar so huge and delicious! I'm here for anything lemon! 

They have a full service deli with meats, spreads, fish, etc, too. 

Hands down one of my favorites places to stop for something good to eat in the mornings or for lunch."}
{"text":"Oh, Bagel Cafe. If I could eat sandwiches, bagels, and bakery items every day and not die, I would secretly move in here.

Everything at The Bagel Cafe is great. The sandwiches are HUGE, and this is not a joke or understatement. When I order the brisket sandwich (YUM), I always have to pull half the meat off so I can fit the sandwich in my mouth - the tastiest of problems. Their bagels are really good, and their cream cheese options are even better - the cinnamon walnut raisin cream cheese is to die for. I even took my leftover cream cheese home once because it's that good. If you like garlic, I'd also recommend their garlicky breakfast options over in the deli area.

Their bakery/pastry foods are the stuff dreams are made of. I avoid the cookies as they are too crunchy for me, but the cannolis, ruggulahs, cakes, and the like are addictive. I bought and drove their baked goods four hours away to California to make a good impression on my future in-laws. It worked like a charm.

Bagel Cafe gets jammed up for breakfast/brunch on the weekends, but it's totally worth the wait and you'll easily understand why after eating there once. It's a little more expensive that somewhere like IHOP or a more casual sandwich place, but I still go when I can because it's delicious. 

Bagel Cafe - the perfect way to enter a Sunday brunch food coma."}

However, the takeout service can be spotty at times, so be prepared to wait a long time (10 minutes +) or walk out as I did yesterday, Feb 08, at around 2 PM when they had only one guy working behind the counter. And there were 3 other customers in line behind me!"}

This place is VERY popular so there will probably be a wait to be seated and your server is going to be crazy busy. I think most times we've been there something from our order was forgotten. But they're friendly and our last trip in they brought up some samples of a new cream cheese. Yum!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was amazingly good. So much to choose from with a full house. I came here for brunch and waited to be seated, the lady asked if I wanted a table or booth. It didn't really matter to me, so I politely told her witch ever comes first. I waited maby 10 mins before being seating, I thought there menus were really unique because it's made out of real newspapers giving it a different kind of style to it. Looking over the menu I order a organic spinach and feta cheese omelette with fruit and a blue bagel. Everything about this place so awesome, it didn't take long to get my food and the customer service was exquisite. I'm here for Long Jevity"}
{"text":"After years of being away from home I decided to go to my favorite deli for my first meal back. I spent the rest of my trip regretting my decision. I ordered 1/2 Salmon Salad sandwich and matzo ball soup. The matzo balls were tiny and the soup didn't taste as flavorful. My spouse ordered a brisket dip, and for the the first time ever he didn't finish his sandwich. He said the meat tasted tiny and rubbery. Little meat flavor and we could tell it was reheated in a microwave. We also ordered desserts to go that were sugar filled with little flavor. We spent the rest of the night sick in the hotel bathroom. I think the amount of attention and pride in the restaurant has significant declined. A local favorite that I continually bragged about became our only disappointment in the trip."}
{"text":"I just walked into the door with my family  I was waiting to be seated one of the hostess said with an attitude \"It's seat your self\" she then began to talk about us with a other hostess \" it's seat your self how do they not understand\" the other hostess then said \"Duh\" I will not come back or recommend this place to anyone they have the worst customer service ever. 



The manager or owner just came to my table and told me that they were going to take care my meal if I did not give them a bad review."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Great food - Mahtza ball soup is my fave!!!  Get there early, it gets packed!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite breakfast, and lunch place here in Vegas. Not only can you get a hot Turkey Reuben, but you can get a bowl of Matzo ball soup along with it. Heaven! They have a full Deli and Bakery in there as well, everything is made in store.  Don't forget to grab bagels, freshly made cream cheese, and desserts on your way out! P.s. black & white cookies are my childhood favorite, and they do them of so well."}
{"text":"The only place in Vegas where I have found delicious lox.  All of the meats and salads are fresh...my husband specifically likes the chicken salad. The black and white cookies also must be mentioned as they are the best Vegas has, though not close too ones in NY or NJ. The matzoh ball soup is good, but pricey, at $7/cup. Give me the $12 lox platter with veggies and a bagel and I'm happy."}
{"text":"I love the matzo ball soup with plain toasted bagel! They have delicious food with friendly staff. It gets busy on weekends around brunch but it's worth the wait. Save room for dessert! They have a delicious array of desserts displayed. Make sure to try the black and white cookie. I've been getting. It as a treat since I was little!"}
{"text":"Yes! Finally! An awesome bagel!

Seriously, I left NJ/NY 5 years ago and have been looking for a decent bagel ever since.  Ive lived in Portland  Oregon, all over California, and Las Vegas.

Theyve all been crap. I dont even know if Ive finished a disappointment theyve called a bagel all this time.

Until now.

Yes! Yes! Yes! It's perfect!  
Oh, and that awesome cream cheese!  And soooo much! None of that shitty thin little spread. A real bagel deserves a healthy spread.  Something you can really sink your teeth into.

So happy.

I only wish this place wasn't sooooo far from my apartment.  Oh well. I will live. And I will be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Today was another one of those busy Saturday mornings where I was short on time. My husband and I decided to eat at The Bagel Cafe on a whim because it was close to home. I wasn't impressed ...I was more upset than anything because the food was mediocre for the price. We paid about $23.00 for a Grilled Cheese Sandwich w/ fries, Chicken Salad Sandwich w/ Potato Salad, 1 Coke and 1 hot Chocolate. 

I ordered my Grilled Cheese with a tomato which they charged me 85 cents extra to add to my order. The tomato kept slipping out of the sandwich. I've had better Grilled Cheese at Jack in the Box for $1.29. Jack in the Box's bread is nice ... toasty, and buttery. My sandwich here was soggy and messy. I also get the tomato for free at Jack in the Box! 

I was jealous of my husband's Chicken Salad Sandwich because it looked really good. When he let me try a bite of it I found it bland. The Potato Salad was also tasteless. 

I hate writing bad reviews so I'll end this on a positive note...the Hot Chocolate was delicious. It tasted like it had a hint of Cinnamon in it."}
{"text":"Worst customer service i have ever got. When we seated ourselves it took 10 minutes for someone to come to our table and another 10 minutes for someone to take our order and the people in front of us came 10 minutes later and someone was taking there order already. By the time they took our order the people in front of us already got there food. By the time our food came they made a mistake we ordered a kids meal and asked for a fruit cup they gave us fries we also ordered a triple meat sandwich did not look like it was triple meat with a cucumber salad they gave us coleslaw we had to tell the server.
They didn't give me any utensils for my meal i had to ask. They really need to work on their speed of service and quality of service"}
{"text":"Awesome place food is great!  I've been here twice now to eat and the service is always extremely fast.  We order our food right away and receive it in less than 15 minutes.  The bagels, chicken salad and Nova are a hit! The prices are not that cheap but they're better than the hotels.  I would say this is probably the main bagel shop I will go to from now on."}
{"text":"Love this place! Bagels are just like home in NY!!! Don't try to go on a weekend to sit down or you will wait forever! Service is decent"}
{"text":"I don't come here often, but it never disappoints when I do. Their bagels are good and I love their strawberry cream cheese. Their menu has a lot of other items to choose from, as well. Breakfast is served all day. They also have a great selection of pastries to choose from!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  I had a Jalapeño and cheddar  bagel and egg sandwich, the bagel was the perfect combo of firm and chewy.  Added a cannoli and it was amazing as well.  

The bakery was outstanding boasting cakes, pastries, cookies, and cinnamon rolls the size of a dinner plate. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This visit is a sit down breakfast.  Love the newspaper menu, page after page of breakfast, lunch, and dinner items.  Traditional Jewish Deli with fantastic deli and bakery sections.  Shared a traditional fish platter and salami swiss omelet, all fantastic tasting and so easy to order with the accommodating waitress.  People working here certainly seem to enjoy their jobs, all were so friendly and accommodating.  After ordering at the table I walked over to the bakery and picked out a scrumbish chocolate babka, again so accommodating, the bakery hostess sliced a nice piece for us to eat at the table and wrapped the rest of the loaf for us to take home.  By the time I returned to my table the slice was there with fresh silverware, napkins, and coffee, when I paid my bill the packaged babka was ready for me.  Great food, great service, great deli atmosphere; could spend hours there."}
{"text":"This place has become a favorite of mine whenever I come to visit. Whether you're eating a simple bagel, and full plate of breakfast or lunch, or just having one of their amazing pastries the food is delicious. The service staff is also great - so fun, friendly, and responsive. This is a morning stop well worth finding."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place for years and always thought it was just a bagel place like another Einsteins, boy, was I wrong! The have a full breakfast, lunch and dinner menu, including a bakery and take out 
Ordered the Corned Beef Hash with poached eggs, potatoes, and a toasted bagel. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the potatoes had just the right amount of seasoning, the Corned Beef Hash was amazing! Plenty of corned beef and great taste. The bagel was fresh and delicious! Service was excellent and everyone was friendly! 
I'm definitely coming back to try the Corned Beef sandwich and a Reuben next time!"}
{"text":"Bagel cafe rocks! It has the best service! Super fast and the best orange juice! The food is good and always consistent!"}
{"text":"I love the bagel Café. What's not to love when you come in and you're greeted with an entire deli case of baked goods and another of fresh-baked bagels. I always have to grab the black-and-white cookies on my way out. They are such a treat it's like a cake with frosting disguised as a cookie I just can't say enough about the black-and-white cookies. But you do have to eat your lunch so today I had the cream of turkey soup. What a great concept it was a delicious cream soup with tons of veggies and big chunks of turkey in it. I almost didn't order it but I'm so glad I did of course I had a toasted onion bagel with butter not cream cheese because that's the way I like it!!!"}
{"text":"Looked for good Salmon Lox and found it here!! There's so much more to offer on the menu great for breakfast and lunch! Will definitely be back!

{"text":"Always good always good service. Food portion are big. We eat here often. Everyone is always very nice. You won't regret going here ever."}
{"text":"It was my friend Ms. W's last morning in town and she specifically requested we come here. On a Sunday around 8:30a we easily found two tables to push together for our party of five adults and one baby in a stroller. 

As far as entrees go, I think my hubby made a great choice with the pastrami sandwich. That meat was so flavorful and piled high!

I got a corned Beef and Cheddar omelette with potatoes and an everything bagel. The corned Beef was nothing compared to that pastrami and the omelette wasn't seasoned at all. But the potatoes were good and that bagel was perfect! Honestly, next time I would vote to create my own plate - everything bagel covered in cream cheese, butter and piled high with pastrami. 

I also had to try some sweets. I have to say that while the cannoli wasn't for me (the shell was very thick, crunchy and dry) I adored their gluten free chocolate chip cookie. I didn't buy it because of being gluten free, I bought it because it looked good. You see, I'm not a fan of shortbread-type cookies, so these looked more up my alley. And boy were they perfect - all the chewy goodness you could want!

All in all, we would definitely return!"}
{"text":"The fresh squeezed orange juice was out of this world. It's probably the best orange juice I've ever had in my life. 
The hash brown potatoes were SO amazing. My husband had one of their giant meat sandwiches and he's very picky about meat. He said it was THE best pastrami he's ever tasted. I had a delicious omelet. Our server was friendly and sweet. I can't believe it took us two years to try this place. I think it's our new favorite!  We were very impressed with the place!!"}
{"text":"The first time I ordered from here, my burger was burnt. It was so burnt that it ruined the whole thing, couldn't cover up the taste with anything I didn't finish it. I decided to give them another chance and order something else, their menu mentioned a hot sandwich with cheese and ham, so when I called to order it, I said I wanted ham twice, I pick up my food and when I go to eat it, no ham. Not happy with this place, never going back again."}
{"text":"This diner/deli and bakery restaurant features many enticing treats, sweets, and, bagels... oh, my! It has a New York feel, which included its patrons, along with Kosher items. 

 Inside the dining area, the menu is listed on a nostalgic newspaper. I had the special listed on the white board: asparagus with goat cheese omelette with French Vanilla coffee. The eggs were right up my ally, light and fluffy, a sign that they were cooked low and slow. The asparagus was young and tender, chopped small resembling green onions, and the serving was generous. That, with creamy goat cheese, was a very satisfying dish. The toast was made from homemade wheat bread, thick and light. The bill was fifteen dollars... The quality of the food in relation to the price trumps the quantity, along with the wait (there is a disclaimer on the menu that your order can take 20 minutes.) The coffee was aromatic and flavorful. Service was standard, nothing to write home about. 

 I could not stop there, though, and had to take something home. The chicken pot pie looked too good to pass up. Reheated, the gravy was buttery and creamy, reminding me of a rich cream base you would find a clam chowder, just with chicken.

 I will return with a few things to on my mind to try, including the lox, and the huge eclair."}
{"text":"I am an advent bagel lover so obviously I needed to check this place out. I've had them a few times when coworkers brought them in and I loved how fresh & delicious their bagels and cream cheeses were, but never actually went inside.

This most recent time I finally came in for a take out order. I like that the set up is separate for take out orders vs sitting down and dining in. I decided to go with the pepperoni pizza bagel on a garlic bagel. The portion was huge, definitely worth the money. I really liked the flavor of it, but wasn't a huge fan of all the oil which made the bagel itself kinda soggy. 

Overall I still think this place is great and would certainly come back again for some take out bagels or to try their dine in options. Such a cute little home towny place!"}
{"text":"Best bagels in Vegas. I really miss this place since we moved back to California. No bagels even close to this good in OC. LA yes. I used to eat here 2 - 3 times a week. The everything, sesame, and poppy bagels are great. The cranberry is also awesome. The flavored cream cheeses are excellent as well. Black and white cookies and others sweets are good too."}
{"text":"Love the Bagel hated the customer service when I came in there was no smile on nobody's face everybody look like they hated their job it was just a bad environment to be in I don't think I'll be going there again I'll find another bagel place also that was my first time going so I didn't know where to go and they all just looked at me like if I was stupid PS they ruined my morning"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a lot.  Had cob salad with blue cheese.  Found a noodle in my blue cheese dressing and it was water thin.  Gross gross, the cheese looked like cottage cheese in the dressing.  Gross gross.  Don't order this."}
{"text":"This is for the bagels only. Bagels are good; better than the average decent bagel in the world. The crunch of the exterior is just snappy enough, and the insides have the proper cushiony bounce without tasting fake. The few flavors I tried all worked: The plain (duh), the egg (yes), and the spinach feta (thought, what the H -- turned out great.)

It's been years since I've actually eaten here, so I can't speak to current strengths/weaknesses of the dining experience.

The bagels, however, are good, if a bit pricey. You'd do better to get a Dozen (which really means 14) than just a handful. But get what you need - it'll be worth it."}
{"text":"Thank god I don't live closer to this place. They have the one of the best varieties of bagels & shmear choices in Vegas. Almost reminds me of NYC (not quite:( ), but close.. They have cakes (whole & per slice) ,cookies, rugala to meet your every sweet tooth craving. This place is big & normally pretty full. Doesn't take long before being seated. If I lived in Summerlin, this would be a regular stop. They serve breakfast & lunch, large menu, food is all good. Looking at the pictures of the bagels make me want to go!!( Bad bad bad)"}
{"text":"Garlic cheddar cream cheese changed my life. Super slow service though. The matzoh ball and chicken noodle soup are both good. They also offer a grilled cheese with tomato and bacon which I always plan on ordering but then the bagels just look so good.... don't go here on your lunch if you work in corporate america like me and only get an hour break unless you work literally across the street. They have a huge dessert selection. Staff is nice, they just are not in a hurry. I totally recommend going here and getting a dozen bagels and cream cheese for your co-workers in the morning. They are the best bagels in town."}
{"text":"This place is ALWAYS packed and after visiting a few times, I can definitely see why!!! It's a restaurant, bakery, and a little meat market all in one! They give you HUGE portions. I don't think we've ever left without a doggie bag! Everything we've ever gotten has been so fresh and delicious. Their potato pancakes are gigantic. The first time we ordered them, we were thinking about getting another order because the menu said it would only come with three, but when they came out, we were glad we stuck with our ONE order. Usually, I find, the bigger the portions, the sucky-er the food, but not the case with this place!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. When you first walk in the first thing you see are the deli cases, the display cases with the bakery items, and a variety of bagels. They have several different kinds of cream cheese, cakes, pastries, meats, salads, etc. We were told to seat ourselves and a waitress would come to the table. I also noticed there were a few people waiting for take-out at the counter. The menu is huge. It pretty much has everything you would expect at a deli of this size.

I'll go over each item.

Pastrami Ruben: The bread was too greasy from too much butter. The pastrami was definitely not made in house. The sandwich was okay. I probably wouldn't order it again. The fries they serve are pretty awesome though. I definitely like the fries! I also like the cucumber salad they serve on the side. Oh and their deli style pickles are also freakin' awesome!! Great pickles.

Matzo Ball Soup: I never had it before. It was pretty much chicken noodle soup with two dumplings. It was okay, but not something I would order again.

Lox & Bagel: The platter came with the smoked salmon, tomatoes, onion, capers, cream cheese, and bagel. Everything on the platter was excellent except for the bagel. It did not taste like a fresh made bagel. It was more like something from the store. It was not bad, but I was expecting better.

The potato knish and the potato pancake were very good. This was the first time I ever ate a knish. I would probably order it again.

The service was good. Our server was very pleasant. Overall the food was not anything spectacular. Sorry to disappoint all the reviewers who gave them 4 and 5 stars, but I didn't eat anything that made me want to rush back here. It was just okay."}
{"text":"Passing through Vegas and found this place on Yelp. I am very glad that I came in.  There is soo much to choose from and everything looks absolutely delicious! Thank goodness for good staff, Clayton helped me decide what to order & was very kind, helpful, and had exceptional customer service. Food isn't the only thing that makes a place great. I believe it's all about who works there. Well at least for me that's how I know if I will revisit a place. Thanks to Clayton and the yummy food I will remember this spot, return in the future & recommend to my local friends."}
{"text":"I'm give this place 4 stars for its amazing service and smoked salmon. I ordered the all nova lox and boy was it big. I was full by the time I was half a bagel in. I will say, it was salty with the olives, pickles, and salmon, but I put more cucumber and cream cheese and YUM. The smoked salmon was actually imported from Brooklyn, NY. It was very thinly sliced (UH-MAZING) and super fresh. I ordered the plain bagel for my lox, but even when they heated it up, it was still cold and not that soft. I looked around and almost all the people in the restaurant ordered breakfast items rather than the bagels. 
I also ordered the cup of soup with a side of garden salad and it was really good! I had the matzoh soup and it was good. It tasted almost like chicken noodle soup but different. The garden salad was very big and delicious. I had thousand island dressing on the side."}
{"text":"I know it's a bit much but I had, bar none, the BEST chicken breast I've ever had!!!  I didn't even know boring old chicken breast could be so mouth wateringly delicious but it was.  Melted Swiss on top with a side of homemade sliced fresh cucumber salad and a dollop of fresh cottage cheese, farm fresh lettuce and tomatoes made it a meal to remember.   Oh, and the service was five star!!  I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Great selection of  quality bagels and spreads.
Sweets look good too, can't wait to try them"}
{"text":"Their coffee and bagels are great. My omelet was big, bland and boring, though. 

Also, I never, ever trust a bakery whose pastries are that oversized; they're usually trying to compensate for lack of flavor or quality.

I'd give them fewer stars, however their name is BAGEL Cafe, and their bagels ARE pretty decent."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and always leave satisfied. The matzo ball soup is good, sandwiches are tasty, and the fries are really good. Prices are typical for a deli. We've never had service issues either. I docked one star because the breakfast portions are on the small side and hubby isn't a fan of the chopped liver."}
{"text":"Good variety of food.  Has a bakery.  Easy seating and the food comes out fast.  The parking is probably my only complaint!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast, but the bagels (and endless variations of cream cheese) kept me coming back. My mom lives in Vegas and I tried this place on my last visit, which led to me visiting it two more times the entire week I was there. Definitely a must try for anyone who lives off the strip or wants to escape it for an hour or two."}
{"text":"We were running errands with a long list of to dos when the hunger pangs bit.  Bagel Cafe was just at the next offramp. So an instant decision was made to duck in for a quick bite.  After all it was well after 1 o'clock and the lunch crowd should have moved on.  Sure enough, we were seated immediatly and put in an order for soup and two sandwiches, a glass of water and a soda.  Anxious to move on with the day's agenda we got our soup and drinks instantly.  Then we waited and waited and waited some more for two simple sandwiches.  After a number of apologies from our server and another 30 minutes, they finally arrived.  Food is always great here, but the kitchen staff needs to step up its speed game."}
{"text":"This is a very popular breakfast/lunch place. When you walk in you are tempted with tons of delicious pastries ( not a good place if you are on a diet, but probably worth the calories) if you are coming to eat here over the weekend expect to wait from 10-30 minutes.. Is the wait worth it? The food is not bad, but personally I only wait for amazing food. Another thing I did not like was their warning on the menu. The ask to please not to share the sandwich!!!! Come on!!! It bothers me a lot when restaurants tell you what to do, its not like I'm not paying for the product, it shouldn't be your concern what I do with my food! Good thing I dont like sandwiches but the warning is just annoying
I ordered the crab egg Benedict and it was too fishy for my taste. I know it sounds weird but I hate when my meal smells and tastes too fishy!  I had to opportunity to try the turkey sandwich and it was pretty fresh. However, the sandwich was not extraordinary! Overall, decent food and good pastries"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! On our vacation we came here on the first morning and had bagels to go. And on our last morning here in Vegas we came back to the bagel Café to sit for breakfast. Love that they have pumpernickel bagels! And the  coffee is hot! Definitely recommend this place!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been trying out new spots (for us) for breakfast and if I could give this place 10 stars!!!! We had the biscuits and gravy and a sausage and cheese omelet.  The biscuits in the biscuits and gravy were absolutely awesome!!  Better than grandma made!  Everything on out plates was delicious and the service was friendly and timely.  On our way out, we stopped by the bakery in the front and took home some toll house bars and apple fritters!  WHOA, they were so good!   We will definetly be back and recommend to everyone one we know!!!"}
{"text":"The service is very friendly and they have an amazing selection of hand-crafted eats. The bagels and lox are amazing and I love the freshness of the bagels. The scallion cream cheese was delicious. We will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Awful!!!!  Do not go here.  Poor service, really bad attitudes, food is just average and overpriced!!!!  Bagels really aren't very good.  Want good deli  food go to Cantors, they rock!"}
{"text":"Busy mornings I must say, took a second to get us seated but busy means good!
There's a cafe and a bakery separate from each other inside! You can also choose take out! As for pasteries, there was a lot to choose from! 
Very very loud inside, but since I've only been here in the morning I don't know how it's like during lunch.

The menu is really big, so I took the longest time trying to pick something. Don't get me wrong though I love variety! 
The food came out fast, and had us filled! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch. Traditional NY deli and the sandwiches are big enough to choke a pig.
I got a baked salmon salad, and I had to bring half home.
Definitely going back"}
{"text":"Born and raised in New York the warm and soft bagel is a part of my heritage. It seemed that I would have to board the Concorde if I was to have a New York bagel in a reasonable time. That was until I stepped foot in the Bagel Cafe.

  The Bagel Cafe is a slice of the Big Apple approximately ten miles northwest of NY-NY in the Summerlin community of Las Vegas. The four times that I have had breakfast here in very recent times, my mind literally left Vegas and entered a New York bagel restaurant. As soon as I stepped on line, displayed right to my left were Wise Potato chips. Wise Potato chips are a popular brand of potato chips that are extremely popular in New York, but sold in a few places in Vegas :( . When I looked to the right, standing out from the display cases of cookies were the rainbow cookies. Since leaving New York, I have rarely laid eyes on them in Las Vegas. The closest rainbow cookies that I have seen to Las Vegas were at Chompie's Deli in Phoenix. After being seated sitting in front of me was the warm and soft bagel. Three times, I ordered egg salad on a bagel and once a BLT on the warm and soft bagel. The quality was superb. The bagel sandwich was overflowing with egg salad that was topped off with lettuce, onions, and a tomato. The BLT was the antithesis of the pathetic BLT that I recently ordered at Panera Bread. It was overflowing with crunchy beacon. With each sandwich, I ordered potato salad and coffee. The coffee tasted just as good as the bagel shops that I remembered before Starbuck's came on the scene. In actuality, the coffee is just as good as Starbuck's.

  Just like New York, the Bagel Cafe is crowded. Parking is a challenge, and it is almost guaranteed that some walking is required. The Bagel Cafe is located in a professional park on the west side of Buffalo Drive south of the Summerlin Parkway. Unlike the New York City landmarks, it blends in with the professional buildings. On account of the parking lot being linear with the popularity of the Bagel Cafe, each time I had to walk the distance of two professional buildings (not complaining. I went here before hikes). On weekends, there was a wait. The Bagel Cafe is relatively large and the weekend waits were no longer than 15 minutes. On the other hand, it was less crowded on a Wednesday at 1 p.m., and the \"Please Wait to Be Seated\" sign was turned around to \"Please seat yourself.\"

  The Bagel Cafe differentiates from the prices of the New York bagel shops that I know of in New York. Unless inflation at the New York Bagel shops went up in double digits, the Bagel Cafe prices seem steeply higher than those of the bagel shops that I remembered. From my experiences here, it is the Waitresses that can make and break the price. The first two times that I had my New York moments here, the sweet Waitress passed on a tip that if you order a sandwich on a bagel instead of bread (Did not come here for bread) that you get a full sandwich for the price of a half sandwich. Fast forward to the last two times, and the impersonal Waitress was charging me for the full sandwich (check with tip came to around $15). But what could I do?  It would still be far less expensive than flying in a Concorde to New York.

  If you grew up with the New York bagel, or are just a fan of it; I recommend the Bagel Cafe. On the four visits that I visited Bagel Cafe, I have made it a point to stop by on the way to a park. Admittedly I planned to hike in a nearby park a couple of those times with the excuse to check-in here. I am so confident that I will get in a mood for the New York Bagel. With that said, I see Bagel Cafe check-ins in my future.

****Please note that there are other establishments using the Bagel Cafe name or similar to it. The one in the Sun Coast I rated 2 stars."}
{"text":"Love this place! Old school Jewish bakery feel. Bagel sandwiches are super fresh and amazing!! Serve variety of breakfast and lunch items, but I love their bakery items more than that. Great for picking up quick treats for clients that you can't find at a grocery store."}
{"text":"Worst customer service for a walk-in I have ever experienced. Walked in on June  26th, 2017 at 7:15am in the morning. I was waiting in front of cash register to place an order to go. One employee was organizing silverware the other sitting in the counter having his coffee. After standing there for 2 minutes employee organizing silverware asked if I was waiting to place order. I replied with a yes, nothing happens for the next 2 minutes. I turn around, walk out the door get in car and leave. I think the person drinking his coffee was the manager. Well, we don't want his coffee getting cold. By the way, place was empty."}
{"text":"Always awesome here they have all kinds of desserts, super fresh salads and great soups. Usually a short wait and it's always worth it because when you sit down you're given great service. Open on holidays which is really great.
The parking lot is horrible no one parks in the lines and it's really too small for such a popular bakery surrounded by offices but that's usually the only negative."}
{"text":"Homemade Potato Pancakes with Sour Cream and Apple Sauce ($10.95). The exterior had a nice crisp, but since the pancakes were so large and dense, the interior was not as pleasant in texture or flavor (imagine somewhat-cooked, mushy, grated potatoes with no seasoning). They looked more like burger patties than pancakes. The sour cream and apple sauce did not help.

Side of Homemade Corned Beef Hash ($6.95). Tasty with a decent crispiness. Definitely one of the better corned beef hash I've had in the valley, though not amazing.

Crab Cake Benedict with Lump Jumbo Crab ($15.95): The crab cake was good and the portion is very generous. Decent hollandaise. The home fries were just okay.

Combination Platter 2: two bagels, two cream cheeses, 9 oz. fish ($33.95). I chose Everything and Egg bagels, Scallion and Olive Pimento cream cheeses, and Nova, Lox, and Smoked Whitefish. Each of the Smoked Fish Platters come with tomato, red onion, cucumber, olives, pickles, and capers. The bagels are great. I got them lightly toasted (the best) and they had great taste and texture. The cream cheeses were also good and I really enjoyed these particular flavors. I did try a bit of the Garlic Cheddar and that one good, though I preferred the other two. The Nova and Lox were great, however, the Whitefish was not as smokey or tender as I'd like. Not a big loss for me since I'm more concerned about the salmon anyway. Lastly, I loved all the fixings! The pickles were great and all the vegetables were fresh and plentiful.

The food was a hit or miss for me. Though I enjoyed the Smoked Fish Platter, everything else was just all right. In addition, service was shoddy. Our server was very nice, however, she rarely came to check on us (we had to flag her or someone else down three times). We didn't receive a single water refill when we began to look around the restaurant and wondered if that was typical. It wasn't; other diners' cups were refilled moments after I saw them empty. Our cups remained empty while we continued to look for someone to assist us."}
{"text":"come hungry! best bagels, cream cheese, omelets!!!! love every thing they make (except desserts, i don't think they use butter, so desserts are just ok) highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The to-go bagels are fantastic, incredible quality. However when I went in for lunch today, the corned beef sandwich gave me pretty severe food poisoning. Currently writing this from the bathroom.. like I said, stick to the bagels and you'll be fine. A bit pricey, but totally worth. 

EDIT:

As you can see somebody from the restaurant aggressively responded to me and essentially called me a liar.  I had eaten nothing else that day, and my illness was most certainly not caused by anything other than my meal at this restaurant. I have never had the flu, a stomach virus or food poisoning before eating here. 
They have just lost two customers and I will be sure to spread my opinions to coworkers and friends. 

Downgraded to one star due to their response. It was unnecessary, rude and simply inaccurate."}
{"text":"Good kosher food, excellent deli, and best bagels in town. Deli staff is rather direct, borderline rude, but that's the traditional deli way I guess. A hidden gem"}

{"text":"Rarely can a place garner a 5 star review from multiple critics and diners alike. But the bagel cafe has done what do many fail at. Give you amazing service , and some of the best damn breakfast you can get while at it. From walking in the decor is just welcoming. The staff greets with smiles acknowledging you the moment you step in and doesn't have that hectic busy , let's get everyone out of here were in a rush type of vibe.walking in already simply inviting. Its also good to just do something different and that's what the bagel cAfe does. Different . the menus are printed in newspaper and give you bagel chips with cream cheese that changes every now and then. Giving the freedom to the staff to experiment is also a giant bonus in my book and man can they pull it off. Bring any tourist to this spot and you're guaranteed positive feedback. Trust someone who has. The Apple and orange juice are as fresh as you can taste and just gives you that smile on your face from every sip. From the delicious omelettes, sandwiches , and bagels that they serve, to the freshness of the juice you drink down, and all the way until you step out the door of this amazing restaurant , you are sure to have a smile on your face. And that can be surprisingly rare in today's food industry. 

Kudos to the owners and the chef! 
And thank you to all the staff for making this a five star restaurant !"}
{"text":"Food is excellent. If you need an idea for lunch try the tuna sandwich. The potato pan cakes were fabulous.

I ordered a hamburger with cheese got home and no cheese on the burger. Really???? I called the they said they were sorry."}
{"text":"Excellent Bagels! Much better than Einstein Bagels. If you're in the area you should definitely try it. Very nice inside and a wide variety of other things I wasn't expecting like smoked whitefish, sturgeon, salmon, and also pastries of all kinds. The cashier could have been a little friendlier, other than that the Bagel was awesome and they really slap on a lot of cream cheese. It was a meal in itself. I also couldn't resist getting some fresh squeezed orange juice.Thanks!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Easy to see why it has been \"Las Vegas Best\" , so many times. 
From the super stacked sandwiches to the salads and bagels and baked good from their amazing bakery. There is so much to choose from, you won't leave dissapointed!!"}
{"text":"Oh wow this place is always amazing! Corned beef, lobster rolls, matza soup and bagels are so delicious. And their pastry and sweet selection are insane. A tad bit pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and I've eaten here probably a dozen times.  This place is a \"must go to\" for anyone who truly loves Jewish deli food.  Let me just say I am very hard to please as far as real Jewish food goes.  I usually hate restaurant matzo ball soup but saw someone else order it and it looked great so I ordered it.  It was perfect.  A hearty chicken noodle soup with loads of noodles, chicken chunks, onions and carrots.  The matzo balls were perfect.  Not those typical light fluffy things other delis serve.  A solid 10 out of 10.   The blitzes were the same.  Super perfect and delicious.  10 out of 10.  Potato knish was good, not the best I've had.  Maybe a 7 out of 10.  Sandwiches look amazing but I've never tried one.  They have an amazing bakery too. Had many wonderful things from there.  Cheesecake is an 8, carrot cake is a 9."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places in town!!! It's really chill and the ambiance feels like I've been transported to New York. Get anything with lox here, matzoh ball soup, and you have GOT to make sure you check out their pastry selection. They are to die for. Boston cremes as big as my head! Everything here tastes fresh! So explore ahead without fear~ *Note: DON'T FORGET THE DELI.

My only gripe with this place is every single time I've been here the service is terrible. Been left here waiting for 15-20 min at my table to get my order out...and it's not even busy. And splitting checks is always hard---SO BRING CASH. Regardless, I love the place still...just not enough for a 5 star..4.5 starts please?!"}
{"text":"As good as it gets!  Great breakfasts and crazy good desserts at a fair price with good service."}
{"text":"Amazing cheesecake!   Haven't met a pastry at the Bagel Cafe I didn't love!  Great variety for breakfast and lunch.  Sometimes a little crowded or a bit of a wait, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Just take one step into this place and you'll know why it automatically gets 5 stars.  The enormous case of gorgeous desserts, alone, is enough to earn them.  As for the menu, I can't think of anything that doesn't appear on there.  It is so hard for me to decide what to get, that I always know before I even order that I will be in pain from over-stuffing myself by ordering multiple items.  Sourdough bagel with strawberry cream cheese! The oatmeal!  The eggs benedict!  The potatoes!  Black and white cookies!  The only things I'm not impressed with is the coffee (like coffee-flavored water) and the matzoh ball soup (my mom's is waaaay better - her matzoh balls and broth have flavor).  Everything else is amazing."}
{"text":"Simple review:  Nothing but the best!! Real bagels, lox, cakes, whatever your NYC/NJ heart desires will be found here!"}
{"text":"I'm from NJ, so this girl knows what makes a good bagel. These are definitely very good bagels. I got an egg salad sandwich on a bagel with a side of potato salad. The egg salad was alright - a little bland, but it was still pretty good. The egg bagel was sweeter than I am used to. I actually ordered it on an everything bagel, but they got the order wrong. The homemade potato salad with also alright. It had more veggies than I'm used to, but wasn't bad. Big fan of the Dr Brown sodas in the fridge. I think the $13 for my bagel and soda was pretty steep for what it was. I might go back again, but only for the bagels -- probably not for a whole lunch."}
{"text":"Best bagels in las vegas! Serioualy! Im a born and raises new yorker transplantes here. The first thing i tried to find when  i moved here was a good deli,pizza and bagel joint. As for bagels,this takes the cake. Fresh and juat like back home! Also their other bakery goods! Rugulah,real black and white cookies...soo good. Thwy also have the hard to find matzo bal soup! Its good but mine is better lol! Great place for breakfast or lunch, w friends and familu"}
{"text":"Easily the best bagels in Vegas. Little pricey, but portions are huge! Have had the chicken salad sandwich here before. The onion super egg is my favorite"}
{"text":"Ive been going here almost 10 years now. I just recently started bringing my boyfriend and it now our favorite breakfast spot.  He likes it a lot too.
I love corned beef hash and they make one the best ive ever had.  I get that almost every time.  The other things i get are always also very good too. Their portions are huge and they almost always come with a bagel on the side which are also best in town.  They also have giant NY city style oversized sandwiches. So good!! The salads and soups are also very good too!
They have that deli and bakery counter on your way in and out where they put out all their delicious oversized pastries. I mean cinnamon rolls, turnovers, cakes, and cookies that need to be picked up with two hands.  They make it impossible to leave without stopping by and picking up a pastry or two or three. ...or four...bottom.line.  This is a good place to eat."}
{"text":"I'm really getting sick of the service in this place. I walk in and ask the lady at the register if I should just grab a table..she does not even look up and acknowledge me or welcome me...they have zero servers in here..I got.my drink and told the drink lady I was ready to tell my server..I sat there for 10 minutes ..then there were screaming babies which just added to the total unpleasantness of the whole experience...I always drop at least 125/150 in here I always take a bunch from the deli but quite frankly I'm sick of their bs attitude and service..then that jerk I can't stand in the deli is screaming something accross the entire restaurant totally unpleasant and obnoxuous...and to the owner don't start sending me angry messages defending this crap people pay a lot of money to eat at your place and quite frankly it's not up to snuff.. I really don't care if you like it or not it's honest ..that's it"}
{"text":"I love this place - it is a small slice of NY in Vegas! The bagels are the best and just like the ones I grew up on! I eat breakfast here at least 3 times a month!"}
{"text":"So by now you know we eat out a lot.  We eat out with our kids at restaurants probably more than any other family in LV!!  Bagel Cafe is about a mile away, so it's been another stand-by...but not anymore.

First, their breakfast food and sandwiches are still great.  That's probably never going to change.  But we don't go there for dinner anymore like we used to.  Maybe you don't order a steak at a place called Bagel Cafe, but the last two times my wife wanted steak (while the kids wanted Matzoh Ball soup and stuffed cabbage!), the steak was nearly inedible - gristly, thin, not cooked evenly, and I would hate to see the expiration date on the meat, as it tasted pretty rancid.  I can almost picture a \"Gordon Ramsay discovers something disgusting\" Kitchen Nitemares moment, covering his mouth over a trash bin after a tirade of expletives.

Which brings me to my other HUGE gripe about Bagel Cafe....and it's not pleasant.  The bathrooms...are disgusting...'nuff said.  Maybe it's a result of the huge traffic they get for morning/brunch, and they simply can't stop to check/clean the bathrooms during the day??  There's no excuse for disgusting bathrooms at a restaurant, and probably no greater turn-off, not to mention the health issues.

Clearly, dinner is not their target meal, though they still list many great specials, at least the nights they're open past 5 p.m. (any day except Sun-Tue, I thnk).  To be fair, the traditional NY Deli type items are still great (yes, I too love tongue, liver, whitefish, and other hard-to-find deli sandwiches; knishes, etc.).  Bagel selection?  Fabulous.  The pastries still LOOK as good as ever, but sometimes, after 2-3 bites, I wish they were less sweet, less BIG, and tasted a little more 'special'.  Matzoh Ball soup?  Excellent, if you like the rich, thick, ultra-brothy variety that sometimes even have the layer of fat/oil floating on top.  Now I happen to like that, but today's finicky health-conscious 2010 diner may be immediately turned off....and watch out for the occasional bone shard! 

My last gripe about Bagel Cafe?  The tabletops are too small!  Maybe I have a sense of false entitlement for comfortable seating, but with the huge platter-size dishes (and additional plates for 'sides') they use, a 4-top with 4 people, even when 2 are kids, becomes a challenge in space planning and creative plate stacking.  OK, maybe this gets people in and out quicker...but I have to note this here as a legitimate complaint.  The booths are slightly roomier, but not much.  I feel like I'm sitting in the back row of a Southwest 737 with my seatback and traytable in their upright positions....

I wish I could be nicer to this place!  The servers are friendly and fun, and the kitchen staff often comes out and yuks it up with the clientele.  Maybe they oughta have someone also make rounds of the bathrooms, too...   All this adds up to my first 1-star rating...

Oh yeah...someone else mentioned the cashiers.  YES, I've had problems related to this also.  About 2 years ago, I saw triplicate charges coming through on my credit card about a month after dining here.  They resolved the problem by running credits through after the fact, but I had to bring it to their attention.  Also, if you watch your account like I do, you'll notice that they take FOREVER to clear your payment, which is always an indication that their internal controls and policies may be lacking."}
{"text":"Terrible service terrible communication Bob behind the bar was actually the manager is beyond rude

Screaming at me at the counter and how many cookies I wanted so he knew the proper box to put it in just take my order dude and then you could put it in whatever size box. 
I drove all the way from the strip to come here because of this the reviews reputations never again and the food was just okay former Jewish New Yorker just okay.
OH AND PS if u order a lox platter they'll serve u two measly ounces of lox without a bagel for 11.95 bagel 3.50 if your smart you'll order it at counter and eat at home for 4 ounces it was 10.95 and the bagel was 1.20. RIPPPPPPOPP off if u eat in!!! Oh and the lox they say us nova is actually salty belly lox. It's way cheaper. They think we all a bunchA schmucks ova here!!!!"}
{"text":"Yum is all I can say! Great for families and fast! Great cream cheese you can buy and prices are average"}
{"text":"This is one of las vegas's off strip hidden gem's. 1st time in this restaurant and very pleased with the food and service."}
{"text":"Always love coming here, but what a cluster.   From the organization at the front where they hostess stand is to waiting more than 10 minutes for the waiter to even acknowledge us, they need to re-configure their process, or hire more staff.   When I mentioned to the waiter that we had waited so long, he didn't seem to care and just asked for our order, with a little attitude.  If it was a food review alone, I would have given a 5, but service is so important that I'm only giving a 2 star (mainly due to the attitude).   

I'll try it again and will review or adjust this review accordingly.  

*** SERVICE RECOVERY UPDATE***
The waiter came very quickly with our food order, apologized for the wait and said \"I put your order up next so you wouldn't have to continue waiting.  I also noticed your Yelp review so hope this helps\".  I'm impressed not only with the service recovery but also that they are paying attention to these reviews.  Impressed.  Well done."}
{"text":"dont be fooled by the name! here you can order anything from bagels (duh!) to stuffed cabbage to piled high deli sandwiches to pie and cookies and cakes. oh my.. what an amazing selection the bagel cafe has. it gets pretty packed so if you dont want to wait you can order from the deli and take it to go!

i ordered a bagel with belly lox. came with lettuce, onion, tomato, and cucumber.. all on a platter so you can layer it however your heart desires. i tore the bagel apart in 4 pieces so i can mix it up a bit. lol. lox was perfect.. fresh.. salty.. and not fishy! 

friend ordered a spinach and feta cheese omelette. spinach was fresh! and the feta cheese melted perfectly.. was expecting it to be crumbly.. nice surprise there. on the side was a spinach bagel with jalapeno cheddar cream cheese. how awesome does that sound!!

other friend ordered stuffed cabbage and a bagel with strawberry cream cheese. tasted like they make all their spreads right there!

definitely will be back for more of their hearty portions. they have so many items it'll take a while to try them all. it was pretty busy so service was not too great but the food was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Omg in love with this place! I saw it on an Instagram account and the breakfast sandwich sounded so yummy I had to check it out.

I didn't realize it until we arrived that it was a NYC Italian Bakery as well as a restaurant. There were so many different Italian desserts I wanted to try everything they had! They also offer meats, bagels and cream cheese spreads to buy in bulk as well. 

We got there around 11am on a Sunday so there was about a half hour wait. If you want to get right in I would suggest that you get there earlier.

I was so hungry and ready to eat when we sat down! I decided to get a breakfast sandwich on a jalapeno and cheddar bagel with an over-easy egg. I then added a sausage patty and chive cream cheese to it. Although it didn't look pretty it was amazing! I need to visit again so I can have this or the pizza bagel!

Love having local places like this!"}
{"text":"Sorry I can't give you five stars and this is why......I haven't had all of your food yet. I'm from Long Island New York and been living in Vegas for over 15 years. I've been to many towns, cities and states in the U.S. and this by far is the closest thing to New York. If I closed my eyes I would swear I was in New York.

The service was great and hospitable. I ordered New York style potato knishes  and it was fresh hot and melted in my mouth. The mustard (spicy golden brown) was on point. I also ordered pastrami on rye bread. The rye bread was home made which also tasted like it was home made (amazing) pastrami was lean with little to no fat. I wanted to stand up and give you an ovation.  The black and white cookie was no comment (very Effin good)!! 

I haven't noticed any advertising other wise I would have been here sooner. Congratulation, any family member that comes to town and visit me, we are making a pit stop."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place. My mom suggested we go here a few weeks ago and, at first, I was a little skeptical. It seems so small from the outside that I didn't think they could fit a whole restaurant inside. Well, they do!! They have a full breakfast and lunch menu AND on your way out you can pick up some killer bagels and baked goods. SO good. And their prices are great. Everything I have tried has been great - crab cake, and lots of others, Benedict mmmmm! And I love bringing their bagels home for the rest of the week."}
{"text":"Always outstanding.  They have the most wonderful offerings of fresh baked pastries and bagels around.  The deli is also packed with the best ready to eat treats.  Coming here has been a tradition since moving here, and I love to bring visitors.  The egg salad in jalapeño bagel with their house salad is enough for two meal, so I usually get the half portions on their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Some of the best food around!  I had always just stopped to grab bagels for the office for breakfast, but one morning when I was waiting for my order I looked around and the food in the restaurant part looked really good!  We decided to stop by for breakfast and it took a couple of tries before we were able to finally get in as they are busy and you need to get there early.  Both my boyfriend and I had the corned beef hash and eggs and it was delicious!!!  I've been craving it ever since.

I went for dinner a couple of times in the past week and their dinner food is just as great as the breakfast.  I had the beef stroganoff once and the chicken marsala the next time.  The chicken marsala is the best I have had!  So flavorful!  The meal also comes with roasted vegetables that are always really good.  I cna't wait to go back and try other dishes.  This is one of my favorite restaurants in town!"}
{"text":"We've been patronizing this restaurant for several years.   Everything is always consistently good!"}
{"text":"Best bagels in LV! 
Omg. I didn't even know I liked bagels that much until I had 1 from here. My favorite is the spinach and feta bagel with light scallion smear. 
We always get a bowl of the chicken matzo ball soup because it comes with a bagel. The chicken matzo ball soup is also the best in town! It is packed with so much chicken and is perfectly seasoned and the broth is not oily. 
Service is nice and fast. I also like placing an order for take out at the counter and looking through the pastry selection... The Rugula is worth giving a try too! 

Hot Tip: Apparently, you can't call in an order of matzo ball soup for pick up... You HAVE to come in and order it at the counter....but it doesn't take that long anyways."}
{"text":"This place has amazing bagels.  I'm a huge fan of the cinnamon raisin bagel with cinnamon raisin cream cheese.  I also like the chili here, and my hubby loves the chicken noodle with matzeball.

The reason I give it only three stars is because every single time I go, they're out of something.  In an effort to not waste food, they only make a certain amount each day.  The problem with doing this is that they are always out of something, and they expect you to change your order to accommodate their currently available items.  I hate this, and it's really frustrating.  Last time I went, they were out of three items before I finally just left. 

It's good food when they actually have their menu items.  I suggest going early before the lunch rush to avoid them running out of every other item."}
{"text":"I always want to order off the extensive sandwich menu, and love the reuben, whether with pastrami, corned beef or better yet a combination of the two (for slightly extra) but I inevitably fall on my favorite: the Matzoh Ball Soup. It is literally (not figuratively but in the very real sence) the best Matzoh Ball Soup I have ever tasted. They use both white and dark meat chicken (dark meat being where the flavor comes from) and are sparing in their use of white onions. Most soups with onions taste like onion soup with carrots and a tiny bit of chicken stock thrown in. Chicken is both the predominate flavor and ingredient. Spooning through it is like wading though a lake of chicken and flavor. It is divine.
I always order the bowel sized, it is good for two meals and comes with a bagel and the topping of your choice.  The spinach and feta bagel with the garlic-cheddar cream cheese is my favorite, but the jalapeno cheddar bagel/schmere is a close second.
And the pastry case! Cheesecake is the light and fluffy variety, I suspect they use mascarpone, and the fruit toppings are divine, rugelach, cookies, they even have \"spinach pie\" which I suspect is spanikopita but have yet to try because I always order the additively wonderful Matzoh Ball Soup.
Cannot recommend enough, but I have never eaten in, as the space is always oppressively hot, being a bakery and all, and I prefer to take the magic home and eat it in air conditioned luxury."}
{"text":"Their food is bar none.. A bit pricey but so worth it especially if you miss the east coast experience.. Irene a lovely woman from Greece was exceptionally sweet and courteous and in my opinion should be a waitress..not a busperson.. The same can not be said for Debra our waitress ..she was non-professional, short and at times right out rude. Otherwise I can only say.. This place is a gem.. Go and try it!!!"}
{"text":"Best matzoh ball soup in town. I love getting breakfast here, best bagels and cream cheese, all made in house. Ive heard they have an amazing deli, but I've never had a chance to try their huge deli sandwiches."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!!!
What's going on at the counter???
Crazy music and guys cursing each other in Spanish? I speak Spanish and I don't appreciate this.
Please fix or we will stop coming in, we love this place for over 10 years but this will not make me want to comeback."}
{"text":"Another wonderful experience at the Bagel Cafe. I'm not sure how 100% can be improved. Service is wonderful. But I would suggest avoiding the high traffic times. Week days after 1 pm is my go to time. This late lunch is enough to carry me through the rest of the day. I'm just too full to think about dinner. Las Vegas prices with New York quality."}
{"text":"This place was excellent.  I live near Lake Las Vegas, so it's a hike for me.  I was up in Summerlin seeing a friend and decided to eat breakfast here.  Since it was a traditional NY style deli, I of course had biscuits and gravy.  I will say, the cream gravy was very good, had chunks of sausage in it.  Could have used a little more pepper.  The knish was good, but too thick for me.  It was crunchy and had good flavor, but if it were thinner, it probably would be the best I have ever had.  Service was great, although I went before 8 AM.  So, not even close to 1/2 full.  The deli case looked awesome, I wish I lived closer.  Given the drive, probably won't come back that often, but we certainly will come back some.  It's worth a half hour drive."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! No complaints at all! Service is friendly and willing to help since it was my first time there. Ended up buying pastries for the go. Bought a pound of assorted rugulahs which included the Almond, Lemon Coconut, Chocolate Chip, Sugar Free Chocolate Chip, and the Apricot one. They were all AMAZING! Especially the Almond one. Will be coming back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"They have The matzo ball chicken noodle soup on tap here. The food is amazing, delicious, and priced low. I could not believe all the stuff we walked out of there with and only spent like $30"}
{"text":"Sooooooo good. We visit relatives in Vegas every Christmas and we are always begging to go back to this place. Portions are big and the service is ALWAYS friendly. The bagels and omelettes are always perfectly prepared and it's quite a benefit when they bring you bagel chips and the seasonal cream cheese to try.... (gingerbread cream cheese is delightfully delicious)! The coffee is always refilled with a smile and don't forget to grab a cookie or cupcake for your post-breakfast dessert. Sure wish we had one of these in Charlotte, NC!"}
{"text":"Clean, upbeat, French cafe'ee. Liverwurst, even at breakfast! Yay! My Mom is totally fouled out. Heh.
 Different coffee drinks, hot or iced, coffee is tasty and good. 
 Fast service, and a good crowd. Eclectic, yeah. Ok, my family is grouching  I spend more time on here than with them. I give my family 5 stars, but that's another story. :)"}
{"text":"I lived in Las Vegas for 25 years and have been coming to Bagel Café since they first opened 20 yrs ago with a very small deli & bakery with just a few small tables to sit at while you would wait for your order to go.  I loved it then and I love it now as it's grown into a full fledged restaurant with many wonderful dishes to offer.  There aren't too many places that make matzo ball soup as good as my own, but Bagel Café's is so good I don't need to bother making my own when I'm here.  I have never had any problem with the servers here, they've all been pretty good with staying on top of everything. I no longer live in Nevada but you can always find me here for my soup and bagel when I come to visit my grown kids.  The prices are little high, but still worth it to me. As always, I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Met up with some other people at the Bagel Cafe, we were presented some Bagel Chips, which was nice while we waited, I ordered a Matzo ball soup which comes with a Bagel and was expecting just broth and Matzo, but it's more of a chicken soup with Matzo. Which is fine, just a little different than I normally have.
Someone else got pancakes, which they did not finish, and another had pastrami which split with a Knish. 
On the whole it was fine. We stopped by the bakery and got some macaroons. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. Just the way I like them."}
{"text":"The food here is always good. I enjoy coming here with family and am always in the mood for the deserts. Just a tip though: check the hours before you sit because if you come anywhere close to closing time, the service goes downhill fast. We asked for dinners but apparently they don't serve them close to closing time and we heard constantly from the waitress that they were closing/or were closed. Felt like we were being kicked out even though we sat down and it was still a little over a half hour till close. Doesn't take super long to eat sandwiches. Oh well. Like I said the food is good and that's where the second star comes in but watch your clocks."}
{"text":"Getting a bagel here is like getting a bagel in NYC.  After moving here from the east coast I pretty much gave up on ever getting a decent bagel again.  That was until I met a former New Yorker who tipped me off to this place. His pizza suggestion was kind of a bust; but the Bagel Cafe really lives up to expectations.  I wouldn't go anywhere else west of Pennsylvania."}
{"text":"Really depends on what you get.  If you get the pastrami sandwich be prepared to love life.  Nice, slightly peppery and with a decent fat content.  Sometimes you get pastrami that's a little dry so their consistency of quality could be better.

Also have sat down to have breakfast there a  number of times.  Sometimes it's delicious and sometimes it's surprisingly mediocre.  Stick to their french toast as opposed to their omelet.  Bagels and cream cheese are always top quality there as well.  

Their desserts are huge and I've found them to be incredibly mediocre.  I know Jewish delis traditionally have those big desserts - but I'm not interested in paying like $5 for a big pile of flour and sugar thrown together.  Make it smaller and I'll pay the $5 for a quality product."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm Bagel Cafe! On our weekend of adventures Jessie B and I stopped here. She'd never been and I've long loved Bagel Cafe. (They used to have a location in Henderson.) It was a Saturday and pretty busy, but we only had to wait like 5 minutes. 

Jessie and I looked over the menu. I knew that whatever I ordered I wanted a garlic bagel to be involved. Bagel Cafe's menu is huge and everything is tasty. After much back and forth I decided on the shrimp salad sandwich on a garlic bagel and a side of potato salad. Jessie choose the tuna salad on an everything bagel with a side of pasta salad. I also ordered an ice coffee! It was huge, but seriously watered down. I was so happy when our food came cause I was so hungry. My sandwich was piled high with huge shrimp, lettuce, tomato, and red onion. Yummy! It was heaven in my mouth. The shrimp melded so well with that soft garlic bagel. Tasty! It came with my favorite kind of pickle, the half done dill pickle! (Swoon) I didn't really care for their potato salad which I remember being good. I think I've been spoiled by Weiss's potato salad. Jessie also gobbled up her tuna sandwich. I was so glad she liked it. 

The service was good considering how busy it was. I love that their dining room is large and you can even just hit up the deli and take whatever you want home. 

I always love Bagel Cafe. The food is beyond wonderful. You may think the prices are a little high, but for the quality and portion size it's so, so worth it. If you've never been go now, right now!!"}
{"text":"The sesame bagel and lite scallion cream cheese are amazing. Out of this world bakery. And a huge menu! Have to go back to try some more!"}
{"text":"I ordered an egg and cheese on asiago bagel to go. There was a long line and the restaurant was full so I thought this is gonna be really good. He asked me if scramble was ok. I said over medium please so it's not runny. I also asked for Munster cheese. He said it would be ready in two minutes. I got my box to go. The bagel is not toasted the cheese is not melted and the egg is so runny all of the yolk is all in the box. Meh at least it was only $5. I wouldn't come back though."}
{"text":"LEGIT!!!

Having grown up in NY but now living in LV, we've missed legitimate delis like the Bagel Cafe.  I can seriously eat their CB and Hash special every day.  Their bakery has favorites we thought were gone forever after we left the east coast.

Thank you for the amazing sandwiches, bagels and baked goodness!"}
{"text":"Our food was good. Our experience over all, not so great. Our server argued over something trivial with us instead of just saying, \" Ok, let me get you a new one.\"  ( It was a cream cheese issue) We asked for the fan over our table to be turned off three separate times as it was freezing in there. Each time we were told ok. If you can't do it, just tell me instead of irritating me with an affirmative response. 
We will give it one more shot as everyone deserves a second chance. I know from experience that all people and places have their off days.
As for the food, he had a bagel and I had pancakes (due to oral surgery, I can't really chew yet). He was pleased with his bagel, was almost as good as back home (NJ). My pancakes we're amazingly good for a NY style deli place!! We can't wait to try some of the desserts we saw while there."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a Jewish NY deli style breakfast/brunch you should definitely stop by this place! 

Probably the best most authentic Jewish deli in Vegas. 

Yummy food. 
Big portions. 
Comfy booths and large space. 
Lots of parking. 
Friendly service. 


The menu is like a newspaper and you actually get a cool vibe while being inside. 

I would recommend to go with the:
Lox platter- smoked salmon is heaven made. 
French dip.
Eggs Benedict.
Most Sandwiches. 
Home fries. 

The only thing that might be a downside is a waiting list over the weekends. 15-25 min.

Great place overall! Highly recommended. 
Trust me. I know food! :)"}
{"text":"Cute place. Love the menus!  They're little newspaper to give the NY feel  bagels were so yummy. LOTS of choices of the menu from breakfast- dinner and desserts!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Been a patron of The Bagel Cafe since I was a kid. It's not far from my house, but I would travel clear across the state for their food. I've lived in New York, arguably the capital of deli perfection. For me, The Bagel Cafe beats NYC's finest, shall we say, *efforts.* The corned beef is my personal favorite and unbeatable! Their bagels are top notch, and their desserts?! Bliss in the form of pastries!

To top it off, the staff- from the servers to the gentlemen in the deli/ to-go station- is always friendly, helpful, and welcoming.

I was so happy to be able to have lunch there today. And I look forward to the next time! Maybe tomorrow ;)"}
{"text":"The food is so delicious! So many options it's over whelming. Lol. They don't skimp here on anything. The portion size is great for the price. Fresh desserts and bagels made everyday. The wait staff is very friendly and attentive. They even have a deli that you can get cuts of meats and other goodies from. Definitely a must for any bagel/New York style food lovers."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I love the whole seat yourself concept. The service was really good. Our server was very attentive, apologetic if she forgot something, and found a conclusion to make it better. ( she forgot to refill our water after 10 min and said sorry and brought us a huge cup haha so cute) 

This place was super busy on a Friday morning. We got the normal eggs Benedict, crab Benedict, pizza bagel, and potatoe salad. Everything was cooked to perfection. I couldn't eat my pepperoni pizza bagel because I was so full from my Benedict! Overall I will be back to try their sandwiches and normal bagels :)"}
{"text":"I felt like my Jewish grandmother was trying to fatten me up. best smoked sable ever!"}
{"text":"This sandwich and rugulach habit is getting ridiculous. The BF and I have come back several times in such a short span. 

The first few times we got breakfast and I highly recommend for eggs benedict fans to get it here. I love hollandaise and they are not skimpy with it, ham actually has flavor, perfect poach eggs. I tried the crab cake version too, and surprised I liked the original better. The corned beef hash was another we tried and I thought it was tasty. I love their potatoes the brekkies come with and the bagels of their name sake actually are quite nice. 

Then I decided to try their corned beef sandwich and was prepared to be only mildly satisfied. I have a little Jewish corner of my heart that beats for childhood Saturdays at Langer's. The corned beef was flavorful, juicy and the marbled bread I chose was great. I always eat mine with  coleslaw and Russian dressing (aka thousand island). I'm normally into pickles, but theirs is closer to cucumber than pickle so I'm not the most fond of it. The sandwich was so good, I was a bit sad to  share with the BF and take the other half of the benedict even though I love the bennie. 

So we came back several more times to get our own. I have to say that the way to go is the soup and half sandwich deal ($10.95- $11.95). It actually comes out cheaper with more food since the sandwich was just as big as a 1/4th lb, you get soup and can even get a side if you wish for $1. The matzo ball soup here is decent, and the sweet and sour stuffed cabbage was nice though I dropped my phone in it trying to Yelp it. We also tried the lobster salad sandwich and that was solid, but I'm gonna stay with the meat sandwiches..... I should mention I lean towards mostly eating vegetarian and this place is testing it. 

Service is pretty decent on checking up. We also don't go during busy times as this is the type of place that gets swamped during regular breakfast/lunch hours on weekends. Beat the busy by heading in a bit later in the afternoon. 

While the sandwich and benedict have been stellar, the dessert counter has been extreme highs and lows so much so that I can't justify a 5star. 

The best: The rugulach are awesomely good. I normally don't like chocolate ones but I love them here, the almond ones are great, all the fruit ones are great. There is not a bad one so even though it is priced per pound, I feel this is worth it. 
The subpar: I'm not fond of the black and white cookie being more like cake. I know a lot of delis do this and I'm just more of a shadortbred person.  The rainbow cookies were okay, but not quite up to my standard with it being too wet though the sponge flavor was right on (those are one of my favorite deli sweets). The homemade twinkie was a bit dry.
 The bad: we got a slice of buttercream cake which was painfully sweet with the frosting tasting like boxed. It was thick, sticky and you can feel sugar granules in it with the cake itself also rather sweet. It was a throwaway so I will not be getting anything else but rugulachs. The desserts aren't cheap for what they are...Spent $27 with only the rugulachs being the only thing we are gonna eat the entirety of. 

This is great place and I do highly recommend this as a go-to if you're in the area, just know how to navigate the deli and massive menu through recommendations."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite breakfast joint :D they have so much breakfast choices and all of them are delicious. They make their bagels and breads fresh because it's a bakery :P and they have a wide variety or desserts as well. I could be a happy fat kid if I lived near this place :)"}
{"text":"The sole singular reason I come to this restaurant is they have the BEST cream cheese I have ever had. They use fresh ad ins which really ups the game on that. Their fruit yogurt parfait is also super amazing. The rest is pretty standard breakfast fare, but seriously don't miss out on the bagels and cream cheese. You are seriously missing out of you do."}
{"text":"Best bagels in town! My boyfriend and I love how fresh the bagels are made to order. We always come here for breakfast and this place has been consistent with great customer service and delicious food. We also love their dessert and baked goods. We never had a bad experience. One thing we definitely have to do is try their lunch menu because everything looks good. It's def our go to spot for great breakfast and baked goods when we're in this side of town."}
{"text":"If I could, I would give it six stars. The breakfast is fabulous and the service is great. I love lunch there too. I always leave with a dozed deserts and love to bring Iyummy filled with goodies for my staff and church. The service is AWESOME
I brought their homemade twinkles to go. The menu covers just about every craving you may have.  It's impossible to eat healthy here so don't even try."}
{"text":"This place is great in that it has an amazing in house bakery. All kinds of baguettes, bagels, rolls, cakes, croissants, you name it. The ambiance is great, almost feels like your in Brooklyn. A kosher menu to boot. 

Our server was great. The food was good and there is a dedicated coffee person who's sole job is to make sure you get your 3.00 worth of coffee. I ordered a jalapeno bagel with 2 eggs and bacon. 7 bucks and it was great. 

I encourage anyone to check it out. Be prepared to wait as its extremely popular. In my opinion, its the best breakfast place in Summerlin. Also a full lunch and dinner menu which i have not yet tried."}
{"text":"This is one of the most iconic breakfast places in all of Las Vegas, if your from out of town visiting drive your button to Summerlin and find your self in new York style deli & dinner!"}
{"text":"Great menu, quality and selection, but I just never see how anyone can charge $15 for a pound of any type of meat.  It doesn't cost $15 for the whole damm corn beef.  Their keiser rolls were just over $1 for EACH. Yes they were big but still that is pricey.  

I think this is a great place but just pricey is all."}
{"text":"This is a review I wish I would have been able to write about a year ago when Mario S first told me about the Bagel Cafe. I never made the drive (which is not as far as I tell myself it is) and now that I have finally tried it, I feel like I have wasted the past year of my life. 

A good NY bagel had been pretty much impossible to find until I walked in the doors to this place. Now I wish I lived closer... preferably in the kitchen of this place. ***Will work for bagels and rainbow cookies***

Tasty NY Bagels... check
Rainbow cookies... check
Black and white cookies... check
Linzer Cookies... check

The rainbow cookies are where it's at. I never thought I would find rainbow cookies as good as the ones my mom makes but these are right up on that same level. If my mom had charged as much as they do for hers... I wouldn't be living in an apartment right now. Although, I would owe her a LOT of money.

Anyway... they need to open more locations. If anyone from Bagel Cafe reads this... please, please, please open more locations! I'll help with construction. Just feed me!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm biased but this is my favorite breakfast spot in town. Always busy and for a good reason. Besides the fresh squeezed orange juice and delicious hot food/sandwiches the pastry counter is just pure decadence. My dad is gluten free and they have the best snacks that I can find for him. The only problem is finding a place to park. Enjoy."}
{"text":"It's always crowded here with old people. Icky.
The waiters and waitresses tend to be grumpy a lot. I would be too if I had to work around all those old people."}
{"text":"Prices go up and bagels get smaller, used to go with wife for a lunch now and then but to poor service and fear of prices still going up we stopped.
And with the high prices they even have the nerve to have a tip jar near register making awkward for  people just getting some take out."}
{"text":"I am sooo thankful to have found this place. I've been craving a reuben sandwich and here was the best sandwich I ever had!! They also have sooo much more stuff I have to still try.
 I will definitely be coming back without a doubt!!

Thanks to \"Chip off the block deli\" I had the worst experience. their reuben sandwich was salty n nasty it gave me a stomach ache all night n they really have the worst customer service especially the owner. I was on a mission to find the best places to eat at n I didn't have to look too far."}
{"text":"When walking in I found the deli counter and ordered their Rueben sandwich that came with French fries and potato salad and everything was absolutely delicious and the corned beef and pastrami were very tender.  I also ordered their French dip and it was good but, the roast beef was a bit dry for my liking, the last thing was a piece of their strawberry shortcake and it was ahhhmazing and so fresh!! I can't wait to come back to try other items on their menu"}
{"text":"Ask any New Yorker what they miss most about back home and every single time you get the same three food related responses. The pizza, the Chinese food, and the Bagels. While the former two are admittedly debatable there is clearly one great Bagel place in this town. The Bagel Cafe is just like back home. It's even worth a drive if you aren't very close by. I've tried Brooklyn bagel deli, big apple bagel, and a bunch of other \"New York bagel\" joints and nothing comes close. They are either too hard even when \"freshly made\" or just not right. I'm sure a lot has to do with climate here, I make pizzas here and understand that it's tricky. But this place gets it just right. You can order a dozen which actually gets you 14 and a pound of cream cheese for like 16 bucks if I remember correctly. The cream cheese is great here too. I get the regular but they have all sorts. They also have awesome desserts here as well. I'm a sucker for good rainbow/venetian cookies and cannolis! Mmm. They also have tons of other stuff I haven't had there yet, I go for the bagels. 
They have a large dine-in area also. And it's often busy here, though never really bad enough to have a wait. I can't recommend this place enough! That said I'm not huge on dining in here. But I never really dine in at Bagel shops. Not even back home except for when I was still in high school and one was right next door. So take that for what it's worth, I get mixed experiences the few times I've dined here for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast and wonderful customer service!  
Wonderful selection of bagels and other bakery items.  DKAkins has competition!!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and the food was just ok. I think I was expecting more of an eat coast diner feel. It was edible but I wouldn't go back. Life's a bagel has way better sandwiches and bagels."}
{"text":"It's no secret that I love sweets.  I was kind of excited to hear that Carlo's (of Cake Boss fame) opened up at the Venetian but with all the bashing they've been getting on their reviews it went lower and lower on my to-do list. Oh well. If they're still there the next go around then it can't be that bad right?

Anyhow I always wanted to try a chocolate babka. Blame it on Seinfeld. That episode left an indelible mark on me because I still think about it to this day. Let's face it, a babka is as foreign to me as a spam musubi would be to a New Yorker. And Bagel Cafe fits my needs perfectly because I'm not planning to go to New York anytime soon.

So my visit to Bagel Cafe is strictly for their bakery/deli side. Those bagels looked pretty darn good. But I was on a mission to get my chocolate babka and thank goodness they still had some. I think I got the second to the last one. I also got a rainbow cookie and chocolate rugulah both sold by the pound. 

Chocolate Babka - A loaf of coffee cake filled with chocolate. That loaf must have weighed 3 pounds. I swear. It was heavy. I hand carried this back to Honolulu. I thought it would taste like Hawaiian sweet bread. But nope.  It's a very dense bread that has a wisp of sweetness to it. I gave some away to share and had a nice french toast breakfast with the leftovers.

Rainbow Cookie - So pretty. Layers of almond extract soaked sponge cake layered between chocolate ganache. So, so good. Moist and very sweet. Wish I bought two or three. 

Chocolate Rugulah - This chocoholic had to get it. It was delicious. Not overly sweet. Wish I bought two or three.

I can finally lay my babka fascination to rest. I would love to go back again. Maybe try their restaurant side which looks kinda casual and quaint. 

TIP: When looking for this place, they are facing N. Buffalo so it's pretty hard to miss. You will see their big signage on their building that kind of look like townhouses."}
{"text":"Haven't had a 5 star breakfast in a while!

What's so different then?  FLAVOR!

I am a sucker for a great omelet...I glanced in that area on the menu and noticed something odd...PASTRAMI as a meat choice!  Let's give it a try :)

Pastrami Meat Omelet ($9.95). I wasn't sure how this combination was going to work out, but I am SO glad it did! Very flavorful pastrami, and everything here was perfect! Love their \"home fries\" aka breakfast potatoes and it comes with a bagel as well!  One of the BEST omelets I've had to date.

All the omelets come with a choice of side...including a Bagel.  I gave the Jalapeno and Cheddar bagel with Jalapeno Cream Cheese a whirl. So good!  A lot of the flavor was in the cream cheese...love how they pair em up!

I also grabbed some goodies from the bakery side....give the ITALIAN COOKIES a shot if you want a super rich, thick chocolaty cake like dessert.  Not sure why it's called cookies, but I am not complaining on taste!

Pics :"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both times I had to leave my table to ask a waiter to take my order. Bagels are great. But food isn't as good as it could be if you the service isn't up to par."}
{"text":"Not much to say except fabulous. Great great great food. Baked goods are amazing and the kosher deli is fantastic. Always a great crowd and the service is always top notch. I recommend the brisket sandwich on marble rye.....amazing!"}
{"text":"Confused about all the fuss.  Parking is horrible and limited. The restaurant is plain and very loud.  The food and baked goods are OK. Not so great that I would go there again.  The corned beef sandwich I had was also OK.  It was busy the afternoon I ate there.  People were coming and going like crazy. There was nothing extraordinary to bring me back to The Bagel Cafe."}
{"text":"What a cute little place! We stumbled upon here while looking for a place to grab brunch and I'm so glad we did. 

When you walk in, there is a fresh bagel section, along with cheese, pastries, and desserts!

= FOOD =
All of our meals came with a bagel that was freshly made! 

+ Corned Beef Hash: I've never had corned beef hash before, but this was really good and filling. But, I didn't eat my third egg because it looked weird and had an \"off\" color. (4/5)

+ Nova Benny: My sister said this was salty but I really liked it. I highly recommend this and would get it over the Corned Beef Hash! (4.5/5) 

+ Egg Whites with Canadian Bacon: Not my dish (obviously too healthy). 

= SERVICE =

Service was just OK. I'll cut them some slack though because it was super busy but my sister had to ask for something 3x (coffee with whipped cream) but they forgot it so we just gave up. I actually even asked for dessert (strawberry shortcake) but they forgot that too... which was fine because it would have been too much to handle at that point."}
{"text":"My wife and I went into the Bagel Cafe on Wednesday June 7. The food was OUTSTANDING and the service provided by Katie Ann was superb. We ordered from the daily specials board and selected eggplant parmesan (only $13.99). This meal came with soup or salad, the entree, a beverage and dessert. To say that the portions were huge would be a gross understatement. I had a very difficult time finishing my meal. You can feed two people with all of the food you get with the meal. We live in the neighborhood of the Bagel Cafe and had been lax in going into there to dine. That will not be the case anymore. The Bagel Cafe is now our \"Go To\" place when we want to dine well for a VERY reasonable price. I HIGHLY recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"The most darling little restaurant. It was packed when we went and I can see why! The pastries are all made in-house.. the coffee was so yummy. Great service and a happy crowd."}
{"text":"I usually just pick up sandwiches from the takeout counter. On my last visit I dined in... What a mistake! The service was disorganized and sloppy. They definitely lost me on this visit. No one to greet us, no one to seat us, I had to ask someone to seat us... It was far too busy for us to find a table. The servers then didn't visit our table for about 15 minutes. The busboy didn't know anything about the menu... And when the server arrived, he was rushed and didnt ask if we had questions. The server then told me they wouldn't add pepper to my meal in the kitchen, and to just use the one provided on the table. 15.00 for. Plate, and they won't prepare it with pepper? Then he didn't bother to up sell the baked goods or dessert, just gave us our bill... We weren't frugal either... Our bill was over $100 for 4 of us..."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. 
Unfortunately the costumer service
Was so extremely! Horrible we will never! 
Return. I visited this place with my parents 
Who are from Ca visiting and wanted them to 
Have a good experience. I also had my 2 children 
With me. We was excited because everything on 
The menu seemed really good. We ordered a lot! 
Of food. We hadn't eaten that day, saving our appetite for this place. My daughter had a corn beef sandwich and it was just Ok. Nothing great. 
My parents each had a full sandwich, I can't recall what type. They each had a hotdog as well. We also had bagel chips and each of us had a knish. And I had a grilled pastrami and corn beef combo sandwich And we also had a few desserts.. everything was was just mediocre. Some things were not good at all. Especially the fries, yuk! The biggest issue, however was not the food. Even though it wasn't very good, we still ate it and didn't complain. But my 6 year old son ordered the kids meal chicken strips, which was like $4.99 or something and the chicken was hard as a rock! There was no way he could have eaten it. Now, mind you at one point our waitress was missing, she never came back to check on us after the food came out. And everything came out one meal at a time, which was very annoying. Especially when there's five starving people. She was very! Slow and took forever. But still no one said anything. She finally came back and asked how everything was, I told her politely that everything was fine except for my son's chicken strips were not edible, especially since he has difficulties swallowing. She took them away in a very rude way and said she will tell the manager. The manager, I wish I knew his name! Was probably one of the worst! Managers I ever seen in customer service. He approached me in a very rude way and the first thing that came out of his mouth was, your son didn't even try a bite! How can I take them off your bill! I explained to him that he did try, but was scared to eat anymore because he has difficulties swallowing hard food, and then the jerk said, that's YOUR PROBLEM! as a mother you should have known not to order him chicken strips. I was in Shock and disbelief. I told him my son was totally fine eating chicken strips, but those were like trying to eat a rock! It seemed very clear to me that I was getting nowhere with this rude cranky manager. My parents were also in disbelief because of his ugly attitude. He didn't take it off the bill and we just paid and left. Over all, this place was a nightmare. We paid a lot of money for the mediocre food we just wanted to be treated with kindness and consideration like anyone else, but no the jerk MOM shamed me over a $4.99 kids meal.  I hope every day he has to endure extremely negative customers just as bad as he is."}
{"text":"Matzo ball soup! I know the name says bagels, but I when I think of this establishment, I think about this soupy treat. When the craving for it hits, a trip to The Bagel Cafe is a strong call.

On my last trip I had a cup of soup with a garden salad, and of course, it comes with a bagel. Service was sweet, but a little haphazard. I requested an everything bagel, but they were out, so I went with garlic (pretty much the smellier the better for me). Fast forward and a sesame bagel arrives on the table. Apparently, they were also out of garlic, but not really. To make a long story short, I eventually ended up with a garlic bagel, but I was a bit baffled by how someone could think that sesame was an acceptable replacement for garlic. The other troubling thing about bagels here is that they are incapable of toasting a bagel with accessories (such as garlic bits or onions) without burning the little bits. They claim it is impossible, but I don't believe them, and there is nothing quite as unappetizing as burnt garlic. But, I digress.

I am a fan of the matzo ball soup. It has huge chunks of tender chicken, carrots, a delicious ball and a nice balance of seasonings without being overly salty. The cup of soup with a bagel would be enough for a smart-sized lunch. Next time, I would probably skip the salad and avoid getting my bagel toasted. The salad was pretty fresh and tasty, but kind of a hassle to eat and heavy on the black olives. Plus, who needs salad when you've got the matzo?"}
{"text":"I went here on Sunday around noon with a group of 6. We waited 20 minutes to be seated, but that is not bad at all considering this is probably the best New York bakery in Las Vegas. 

The wait also went by quickly because they have tons of baked goods to nosh on. I grabbed a perfect black and white cookie. 

For breakfast, I ordered 3 eggs, bacon and a super egg bagel with nova schmear. The bagel and bacon were great, but I was a little disappointed by the eggs. 

One thing I missed out on were the coffee shakes. Next time I come, I'll try one of these. 

Considering how busy they were the service was good too. 

See you next Sunday."}
{"text":"We started going to the bagel cafe in 96 when they opened.  When we werr living in Vegas this became my favorite breakfast place.  I think while pregnant I ate here once a week. Sadly, 14 years ago we moved to Cali and we haven't been back to the bagel Cafe since. On our trip back to Vegas this week we made the drive from the strip so I could eat here again and see if it lived up to my fond memories.  It smelled the same upon entering had the same great, friendly service and as always it was busy but they never rush you. This is the best deli I have been to (sorry NY spots).  This visit I had a meat combo sandwich of corned beef and pastrami on rye.  Just as I remember it!  Perfection!  Yum house made pickle on the side and cole slaw that is somehow not too sweet, has great flavor and not dry like every other deli out there.  My family members each had breakfast items which made me remember how insane I was for their bagels!  We ended up at the deli counter on our way out for bagels and cream cheese to go so I could bring them back to Cali with me.  They were kind enough to give me a bag of ice to keep the cream cheese cold on our drive back.  Can you tell how much I love Bagel Cafe?  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Been here many times always delicious. But PRICEY
Pumpernickel bagels and Bialys  are awesome, but they go fast 
Their new cream cheese with cucumber and cilantro is awesome. 
Parking can be a challenge on weekends and breakfast weekdays. Park far and walk rather look for a close spot."}
{"text":"Awesome experience!  I have been to this place twice and both times it has exceeded my expectations.  The food and service are top notch.  I had the lox platter which was splendid.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great deli just off Summerlin freeway at Buffalo.  Been coming here for years and decided it's time to give them the props they deserve. I'd probably give this NY style deli 4.5 starts but since I can't they don't necessarily deserve a full 5 star rating.

Let's go with the good then I'll drop my tiny bomb on the bad.  The food is high quality and always fresh.  They have amazing breakfast that nearly all come with a bagel and one of their amazing cream cheeses.  Love the scallion cream cheese.  Lunch is crazy good and HUGE!  They offer gigantic salads all with fresh produce, meats and cheeses.  The also offer great dinner specials.  

Today we had a tuna melt that was made with great tasting tuna salad and fries.  We also had a cabbage roll that was served with a cup of soup and of course a bagel with cream cheese.  Loved it all!

Parking isn't an issue as there is plenty of it.  The place is always packed but there is never a long wait so don't fret!  The biggest negative is the staff and their \"I don't give a shit if you're the customer\" mentality.  They kids act like their stuff doesn't stink (imo).  Anyway great food and will be back as I can get over the negative..."}
{"text":"I have no idea why I gave this place a 4 star rating originally. There is nothing wrong with this place other than it is so damn good that the line is long.

{"text":"I love their pastrami here. Matzo ball soap is always good although its always lacking of broth. They will give you extra but for a full price of soup, definitely not a good business practice. 

Pastries are not good, just sweet, with the exception of almond rugalahs. 

2 stars because of customer service. We come here a lot, and you want to charge me full price for an extra broth??"}
{"text":"The Bagel Cafe is a great place to grab New York style bagels cream cheese, a variety of desserts, and Deli Style Food without having to go into the restaurant.

However the bagels are Simply Delicious and reminds me of good old New York which prompts me to return."}

Only visited once in the past, but a place to which several others have been referred when craving a good local deli, it was in reminiscing of Langer's a week prior that breakfast was enjoyed at The Bagel Cafe, certainly not the landmark sort of place found in Los Angeles but a very good meal at a fair price just the same.

Laid out with a grab n' go area, bakery, and deli near the door as a spacious but tightly packed dining room fills the rear it was just after 8am on a Friday that our party of five entered and with family getting seated while I perused the pastry case it was mere moments before the menu was navigated; orders placed and rather weak coffee poured.

Perhaps the youngest people in the place, my 60+ year old mother included, it was not long before pastry selections arrived tableside, the daily muffin and huge slice of crumb cake each buttery soft  while a warm cinnamon roll was unfortunately a bit overbaked, the black and white cookie fluffy and thick although frosting tasted a bit artificial.

Moving onward to mains, the kitchen expediting orders at breakneck pace with  the dining room 2/3 full, it was with faux-Maple syrup cast aside in favor of the real stuff from home that French Toast, Pancakes and Waffles were gilded, the last a flavorless disaster when compared to the textbook alternatives; the the hash simply not my style and the blitzes failing to live up to the high standards set by Langer's and innumerable others.    

Slipping a bit since my first visit, perhaps an effect of such a large crowd or perhaps a result of me overrating the place based on excellent ordering the first time around, The Bagel Cafe remains a competent spot for those craving Deli foods or what is still, in my view, the best bagel in Sin City."}
{"text":"I'm a huge supporter of family owned and operated restaurants like the Bagel Cafe. My dad always says, \"If you see a lot of senior citizens at a restaurant, then you can't go wrong.\" They are on a fixed income, so they want delicious food and large portions at a reasonable price. Although I am not yet age privileged,  I want those same things too. With that being said, I hit the jackpot because at the Bagel Cafe, there was a sea of silver hair.

It is your typical Jewish deli with an amazing bakery in the front. I have probably tried all of their pastries a few times over. Today, I grabbed a booth and enjoyed brunch with my family.

Their servers work very hard and they are top notch! One of my biggest pet peeves is when a server is either too anxious or too slow with the check. My server's timing was just right.

We ordered the Challah french toast, veggie omelet, with home fries, and a bagel and a Belgium waffle. Everyone in our party was satisfied. Next time, I'm going to try the matza ball soup."}
{"text":"First off, I have been eating here since 1996. It is a East Coast style deli, bakery and cafe. They have one of the largest menus with no disappointments in site, except if they are out of what you wanted. They have traditional Jewish dishes and definitely the best bagel in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great portions, great food, great staff - Karie is an awesome server with good humor and very competent."}
{"text":"First, the ambience gets a big fat ZERO for noise, cramped and dirty.  To begin, it is a huge menu so we needed a bit of time to study it, so we ordered coffees.  I have no idea what the muddy water in the cup was and no amount of cream or sugar could help, YUK!  Oh well, I'm a coffee snob I guess.  My husband ordered a tuna melt on marble rye and he ate most of it.  That said, he didn't touch his fries....I thought maybe he was having a stroke!  Greasy!!  I had the tasteless shrimp salad and had them put it in a wrap.  Someone clearly doesn't realize it's the folding of the wrap that holds the contents in and cut the bottom off, so I removed the wrap to eat it after it fell out all over my plate.  No flavor, none.  I'm also a pickle lover and wouldn't call this a pickle.  I grew up on homemade pickles.  How can you ruin a pickle??  Hubby agreed.  The small side of cole slaw was edible.  That's $40 I'm not getting back, but lesson learned.  To be fair, I asked a few patrons who were leaving if this was a regular spot for them.  To my surprise, they all said they come for the soup only!  I think my last point of distaste was the servers wiping loads of crumbs onto the chairs from the previous patrons.  Yeah, no, I don't want to sit on or step on filth and napkins under my feet."}
{"text":"We go here regularly. My favorite is a plain bagel toasted with plain cream cheese but I've tried almost everything and have never been let down.
Friendly service, great food."}
{"text":"As with most 2-star restaurants, I don't have too much to say. 

The bagels were \"good\". The corned beef hash was \"good\". Service was \"ok\". Pancakes \"did the job\". There was nothing truly remarkable about this place. 

EXCEPT... the waitress was noteworthy. She was consistently dropping parts of meals! I watched 2 pieces of bacon slide off the plate when she rounded a corner... and proceed to put it on our table! I even had to call her attention to it, and she needed to be reminded that we needed replacements! Later on she dropped someone's bagel basket completely. Now I know everyone has their days, but this lady was not in good form. 

Needless to say, I don't plan on going back. I'd much rather go to the Cracked Egg instead (see my review for it)."}
{"text":"I like Italian cookies so, when East Coast peeps such as Mario S and John F kept checking in and posting pictures of goodies from this place, I had to make it my mission to go here.  It must be legit.

You seat yourself and read the menu that looks like a newspaper then the server takes your order. For anything to-go, you have to go to the deli/bakery line.

I had such a sugar rush when I ate half a pound of the rainbow cookies. Those treats with the colors of the Italian flag that tastes like almond with apricot jam in each layer and chocolate on top. They're so good I couldn't stop myself from eating them.  I easily spent $56 on rainbow cookies, raspberry rugulach, apple rugulach, black and white cookies, Florentine cookies, linzers, etc.  

Their eggs benedict was also yummy.  Great Hollandaise sauce (consistency and flavor).  It comes with potatoes.  I also tried their cheese blintzes with strawberries.  Each blintz was fully stuffed with sweet cream cheese filling.  I could only eat 1.

They also have sandwiches, matzoh ball soup, salmon, white fish, etc. on their menu. Bagels and schmear, meats, monster-sized cupcakes, 7-layer cake, carrot cake, etc in the bakery/deli. 

I wish I would have known about this place a long time ago so I could have fed the doctors at work more variety of Kosher treats.  But at the same time, I'm glad I didn't know about this place a long time ago, otherwise, I would be 200lbs heavier by now!"}
{"text":"I have such mixed feelings about the Bagel Cafe. I love-like-hate it, all at the same time. So, I will break it down as to why I feel the way I do.

LOVE:
Homemade food.
Fresh baked breads.
House-made Pickles (seriously, they're perfect)
Friendly service

Like:
Their soups are off the chain (I know it's 100 degrees in Vegas, but soup me!)
Corny newspaper menus
Selection of fresh baked pastries and cakes
Over-stuffed sandwiches.

Hate:
WARNING: Don't share your sandwiches (what, the what?! I do what I want with my sammie).
Pricing - $7.50 for a cup of soup.
Chaotic when entering. There's no \"seat yourself\" sign or anyone really greeting you.
How basic and homey the place feels.
Bland, uninspired food.

Bagel Cafe is hidden in a Business Park and they're always busy (especially on the weekends - up to an hour wait). IT's got a huge area in the front where you can get deli meats, cheese, chips, sammies, soups, cookies, bagels, and every other sweet confection known to man to-go. There are about 30 tables/booths. There's not a lot of ambiance and all employees where Bagel Cafe polo shirts so they're easy to spot. Bagel Cafe is very hit-or-miss in regards to what you order. My Matzo Ball soup was excellent and full of chicken chunks (and a few small bones), carrots, celery, and noodles. It's tasty, but nothing that makes it memorable. The tuna salad was bland. I hardly ever reach for salt and pepper and I had to! The Nova Platter small was a small amount of lox, olives, sliced tomato, sliced cucumber, and a pickle that was halved, it was $11.95, way too much for mainly salad bar options. I also can't get over the fact that they sell 1/4 & 1/2 lb sandwich options and state DO NOT SHARE. I get that if you are at an AYCE sushi place or dining at a 5 star restaurant, but at a Breakfast/Brunch spot? I do what I want with my sandwich and sharing is caring!

At the end of the day, the BAD outweights the good here. Overpriced, restrictions, dull food, and lack of organization makes this place a \"meh\" in my book."}
{"text":"Best bagels in town. Their lox is amazing. Cream cheese is great. Regular or strawberry. I usually go with super-egg bagel. So good. They also have great corned beef and pastrami. And their desserts. I can't even go over there because everything is too good. I'd gain like 5 pounds a day if I ate every dessert that looked good there."}
{"text":"Went there this morning for breakfast. Both the Lox and bagel were delicious but they were very chinsey on lox. Had to order a side of lox where we were given a slice and a quarter for $7. Silly no point!  Should give enough to cover two pieces of a bagel no one makes a sammy. 
Thanks"}
{"text":"This is an update to  a previous review I did in 2014.  I wanted to give Bagel Cafe one more try, and probably this will be my last try.  I ordered a corned beef sandwich - no sides, no other items.  Total bill:  $14.00 (the sandwich was $12.95 plus tax).  Yes, the sandwich is large and can  be split between two people, but really?   $14.00 for a sandwich? (and a pickle that comes with it).  I will say, this time the pickle was better than last time, it tasted like a real kosher pickle instead of a raw cucumber.  However, the corned beef had tough, chewy portions that were difficult to swallow, and as last time, it was on the dry side, so I'm still very unimpressed with the quality of their corned beef and won't be doing that again. Also, I didn't see  prices posted anywhere. If there's a price list, I couldn't find it.  So, I suffered from \"sticker shock\" when I paid the bill.  

They must have raised their prices because last time my total was around $16.00 for a sandwich, cole slaw and a bear claw.  I thought this time it would be  less by at least several dollars, since I was only getting a sandwich and nothing else, but obviously not.    I'm reaching the point of simply giving up on 90% of the places in town except fast food because everything is so outrageously expensive in ways that really can't be justified.  If you're okay with paying $14.00 for a corned beef sandwich which  isn't that great, go ahead.  I'm not. ."}
{"text":"A very affordable and delicious option for any meal! Every time I have eaten at Begel Cafe has been a wonderful dining experience. My friends and I make trips here pretty regularly and although we usually have a party of 4 or more, they always seat us quickly. 

I have only eaten here for breakfast and lunch but I have never been disappointed. The food is very good and I always go home feeling satisfied. I have had many things on the menu and I have yet to have something I didn't like. I never seem to have room for dessert, however they have a large selection. Just perusing the pasties on the shelves up front is enough to make your mouth water."}
{"text":"The food is great. The service is horrible and poorly managed. 
I'll pass on going back"}
{"text":"For a NY'er like myself, this place is right on the money!  Terrific deli/bagel place/bakery that has all the NY favorites I've been missing (bagels, black and white cookies, rainbow cookies, rugulah, homemade blintzes and potato pancakes, etc.).  I'd give this place 5 stars but the line to pay was a TOTAL cluster and some regulars told me that it's always that way.  Still, I'd go out of my way from Henderson to Summerlin for breakfast or lunch here!"}
{"text":"Worst food ever. After taste remains of vomit. Waitress was nice but manager was rude. Hair in my food and all we got were excuses. The desserts look pretty but taste old and nasty. $4.50 for a glass of oj expensive vomit all around."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! this place is awesome. Food taste great, servers, bussers and host are fast. You can tell they are doing the best they can to accommodate such a large crowd. this place is busy so if you do not like waiting, I suggest come early or order to-go.
Compliments to the cooks in the back too!!! Cooks at hotels outta' learn from you guys. Lol.
Great job everyone!
I love the menu and the bakery is mouth watering. Everything is fair priced and large portions. My server Karla J is friendly and prompt. Good job girl!
It's a little loud and crowded so I think they should expand. 
I wish there are more businesses like this in vegas."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Food is spot on every time. It is always busy for a reason. It is a Jewish paradise! I have eaten here numerous times and have also done takeout for passover. The takeout is just as good as dining in. They also do special catering for the Jewish holidays. YUM!"}
{"text":"When ever I am in Vegas I always try to make it to The Bagel Cafe with my dad.  Their matzo ball soup is on point as are their bagels.  I recently placed an order of a dozen large black & white cookies which they packed nice for me and are always delicious!"}
{"text":"Tried the Biscuits and gravy. Sorry I left my vonfort zone of Eggs Benedict. Very plain, very little sausage. Live and learn."}
{"text":"The service was very good. But for $40 I felt the amount of food served was pretty skimpy. I mean, really? I should have taken a picture of the fish.The bagels and cream cheese were great but the smoked salmon was not only skimpy but very disappointing flavor wise. Maybe east coast lox is different than I am used to. Not my Grandma's lox for sure. My friend loved her corned beef, though. The potato salad that came with it was good too. There is a full Jewish deli here. Looks delish! Very expensive but lots of choices."}
{"text":"The Bagel Cafe is the best breakfast-lunch place in all of Southern Nevada!

They have outstanding breakfast special, amazing sandwiches and every kind of Bagel under the sun!  When you visit Las Vegas make sure you visit the Bagel Cafe in summerlin!"}
{"text":"First time for breakfast and I have to say it's refreshing to go to a local bagel café. They have half sour pickles that were so good, surprised because pickles are not one of my favorite foods but have to admit that tasted yummy. Breakfast was delicious and they serve before your food comes some delicious crunchy bagels and homemade style cream cheese.denitely delicious."}
{"text":"This breakfast spot rocks my morning, well weekend morning that is.  Them bagels be seriously bangin and the cream cheese flavors are hand crafted.  Cream cheese flavors include nova lox, garlic cheddar, olive pimento, veggie, scallion, plus many more that I look forward to trying now that I've locked in on this gem. Every single bagel they offer is super D-lish.  If I had to recommend my favorite bagel/cream cheese combo it would have to be the one and only (that makes me a little weak in the knees to think of it) garlic bagel piled high with some of their nova lox cream cheese.

Most of their breakfast dishes come with potatoes and choice of toast or one those yummilicious bagels.  Self seating.  The service is great; our drinks never reach half full.  Everyone including the table bussers keep a close watch on your drink and make sure to keep it frequently replenished.  We've yet to try any of the lunch dishes here, but today the table beside us ordered some of their overstuffed sandwiches, and they are ridiculously overstuffed.

Weekend word to the wise - wake up early or wait a little bit.  Last weekend we attempted to venture in around 10:30 on a Sunday and there were people lined out the door waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Best bagels in Vegas! Jalepeno or asiago bagel with jalepeno cheese cream cheese & cinnamon raisin or blueberry bagel with strawberry cream cheese. Mmmm! The first time I came here, I was confused with how ordering worked. The employees behind the counter are sometimes pushy/rude, & food is 'okay'...but regardless, still the best bagels!"}
{"text":"Whether you choose breakfast or lunch, you cannot go wrong with this place. The food that I had here is outstanding. Breakfast is absolutely delicious. Your coffee is fantastic and they have many options and varieties depending on what you want. For lunch, despite many awesome options, their matzoh ball soup is amazing. Being someone who lived in New York City for many years, my favorite place from matzoh ball soup is second Avenue deli. It was the best that I ever had at a restaurant. This does not stray far from that soup and that's a huge compliment.
The location is in a very nice area. The prices are more than reasonable. The service is very friendly.
In writing this review, I feel very confident because I have many friends and acquaintances who recommended this restaurant to me and I cannot agree more with them. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. It is always packed and people speak out loud how they like the food and how  sweets here are to die for.  I enjoy hot matzo ball soup, to corn beef or chopped liver sandwich. Priced fairly, food is excellent, service is prompt with servers with big smile. Brings back memory of New York in Las Vegas. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"What I liked: I like this place very much. The bagels were good and fresh. New York bagels? No. But good! The black and white cookies are pretty amazing! Everyone's food that was coming out looked so good. I want to return for breakfast. 

What I didn't like: When we walked in we waited for a long time to be seated, not because there weren't any seats, but because no one was standing there to seat us. We didn't get a hello or anything from any employee. A few walked by and saw us standing there. Nothing. A guy eventually walks up and seats us. The second time I was there I took my order to go. They were SO BEYOND rude to this little old man standing at the bakery. They asked if I needed help I explained that he was before me and had been standing there a while. They told him he was standing at the wrong place, they mentioned this to him over 5 times as he was putting in his order. He kept apologizing saying normally his wife goes in and he didn't know. OKAY! We get it! Leave the poor man alone and take his order. This place is extremely unorganized as other yelpers have mentioned. I hope they get it together because they could possibly have one of the best places in town! 

I hope my third time is a charm! Will update."}
{"text":"This place is always good. Love the food. If breakfast is your thing, you'll find your favorites, plus you get a bagel as well. 

If you prefer lunch, they have great sandwiches, hot or cold. Beware, they are rather large! But no worries you can get half of one or the full thing, but no sharing aloud!

The sides are choice of coleslaw, macaroni salad, or fries, along with a pickle. The soups are chicken noodle, cabbage or soup of the day. And for the traditional kids menu, Hebrew National hot dogs! 

They have egg creme but to be honest, I haven't tried them. I hear they are good. 

If you want baked goods, they have a great selection. Large assortment of bagels and cream cheese, pastries, baklava, cannoli, and rugula. They even have a no sugar added cheese cake for when I'm watching my carbs but still want something sweet. 

Service is good, great attention to customer service. Only thing that is not so hot, parking, it's a busy place!"}
{"text":"Its your typical NY Deli. Just as i remember when I was a kid. Its good and authentic if you like that kind of food."}
{"text":"Let me preface by stating the food was VERY good. The people that work there on the other hand, not so much. First off, our waitress talked so fast, we couldn't even answer before she was already making up our mind for us. We were supposed to have an option as our side (potatoes, fruit, or bread) and she never asked us what we wanted so I assumed that we didn't get a side with our meal. We did, she just assumed we wanted potatoes. Which I did not. We were served our meal without silverware. And after our meal, we went to the bakery and stood at the counter for minutes with staff walking past before anyone asked us if we had been helped. We noticed we were charged $3.25 for a potato pancake at our table, but they were at the bakery for $2.25. When I asked the cashier why we were charged more she gave me a snotty attitude and said it's cause they \"warm it up.\" Seriously?! Starbucks warms your baked goods for free! When I told her it was silly she rolled her eyes and said \"it's the labor charge.\" I'm thinking \"OMG your ridiculous\" but these words stayed in my head. I wanted to slap her. Then another staff member who overheard said \"it's because it comes with bread.\" To which I replied \"well, we didn't get bread.\"  The service was just downright ridiculous. I was so annoyed walking out of there. Seriously though, the food was great."}
{"text":"Food is always excellent here. Bagels taste just like you would get in New York maybe the buy water from there! .

Walking in you see the deli side of things which you can view the bagel and dessert case along with cold cuts and everything else to make pastrami or corned beef sammies!! 
These guys are great for catering too as they can produce a lot of product your up and coming Super Bowl party!

Ordered the Following:

lox and bagel (everything)
3 egg (sunny) with ham and a jalapeño bagel 

Everything came out piping hot and quick. This place never disappoints.
Make sure you call ahead to see if they're busy because this place tends to be because parking here is a nightmare.

The staff is very warm and friendly and take your order rather quickly. Check them out it's worth the drive if you live in Henderson or if you're visiting.. take the trip!!"}
{"text":"A regular stop for breakfast. The place is clean, bright. Service is excellent and friendly staff. The food is excellent and huge portions. A great value"}
{"text":"Great stuff! just like NYC since they get all the good stuff from there. Only complaint is that the coffee is lousy."}
{"text":"This place is soooo consistently good.  The chopped liver is the best.  Like to make my own combo sandwich.  Corned beef and Chopped liver.  Sounds different, but boy is it good."}
{"text":"If you live in Vegas and haven't eaten here, there's something wrong with you. Or maybe you've been living under a rock. Their challah french toast and everything bagels with nova lox will have you craving more. Don't forget to grab some sweets on the way out...their assorted rugelach and classic black & whites are my go-to's."}
{"text":"OMG every time I go in there and look at their desert case I gain 10 lbs just looking at it :) deserts are huge and priced right for what you get, fresh bagels.  Their Reuben sandwiches are so good best I've had since moving to Las Vegas"}
{"text":"If you're going here I would suggest going for the bagels or takeout items only. We were seated for 4, it was very busy but our waitress was not as attentive as she should've been. 

One person ordered a Reuben and it was super lopsided, one half had all the fixings and the other had none making it difficult to eat. 

The salmon Benedict came with poached eggs which were over done and the middle underneath was torn open with salmon which was super salty and the English muffin was barely toasted and overall the dish was lukewarm. 

Another person in our party asked the waitress if there was an option to get just a plain bagel with cream cheese and lox (sliced salmon) no capers or tomatoes or anything else needed. She gave a complicated answer and ended up charging him for a platter (includes cucumber, après, tomato, onion, olives, salmon, bagel and cream cheese) $12 and brought it with only salmon bagel and cream cheese. You can't tell me there wasn't a cheaper and simpler option? 

The bagel, cream cheese and lox were great. The service was rushed, in attentive and not personable. So I would only go back for take out bagels or bakery items and wouldn't sit down to eat."}
{"text":"Wonderful happy place filled with smiling customers and cheerful staff. Cozy environment serving delicious bagel, excellent breakfast and lunch items. There is a very large menu with a full bakery onsite. Everything looks, tastes and smells great in this place. Very attentive pleasant service with perfectly cooked food. It never disappoints.  :)"}
{"text":"DON'T GO HERE! CROSS CONTAMINATION! (they'll be shut down soon no doubt)
I blame yelp for leading me here. \"Potato pancakes\" (shoulda known) were delivered with NO APPLE SAUCE and NO SOUR CREAM and covered in the side of bacon someone else ordered! Ruined for a vegetarian (or anyone who gives a dang about food safety). The bacon was somehow burnt to a crisp (we specifically ordered it lightly cooked/ softly cooked) 
WHAT! 0 Stars avoid an all cost extremely fake inauthentic jewish food, (the latkes were massive and soggy)

Three dollars for 1/2 an old avocado. 

This trash place should be called The Burnt Bagel or The Bagel Ripoff."}
{"text":"I just found a piece of lox in my refrigerator. I bought here about six weeks ago right before getting ridiculously sick. Instead of grossing me out, the ancient piece of fish just made me want to go back to the Bagel Cafe to restock on fresh stuff.

It's about 35 minutes each way for me to get to Bagel Cafe, which seems like a long way to travel for bagels, but they are without question the best bagels I've had outside of NJ/NY. Having grown up there, I am very particular about bagels. You won't catch me dead in an Einstein. But these bagels are, in a word, fantastic.

They're oversized, big like real New York bagels should be. The crust of the bagel is browned just enough in the baking process, the crumb of the bagels remain chewy and moist.

Another feather in their cap: Bagel Cafe puts a TON of stuff on their bagels. Getting a dozen garlic always results in a massive pile of loose garlic in the bottom of the bag.

As much as I swoon over their bagels (I also really like the onion, asiago and jalapeno cheddar), there's much more here than that. I also like getting a little hand-sliced lox here - while I haven't had anything else from the deli, it all smells OH so good.

As for the dessert case ... I have to plead guilty here. The massive slabs of tiramisu, Napoleons, moist and fragrant macaroons, and ridiculously good (and ridiculously big) muffins, and best of all, rugelach - chocolate, raspberry, apple cinnamon and almond. Score.

A dozen bagels (which is actually 14) is just $10 here, which is sort of insanely cheap. Unfortunately, all the other non-bagel stuff here is so tempting that I wind up easily dropping $30 or more whenever I walk in the door.

But man, is it worth it."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to the Bagel Cafe. I am a New Yorker so my standards for a deli are pretty high. We arrived at 1 pm on a Friday and luckily only had a five minute wait to be seated. However we were not waited on for quite a while. The menu is extensive, so it is difficult to decide what to order. I settled on the corned beef hash and eggs special with an everything bagel. I am gluten sensitive so I mainly ordered the bagel for my husband to take home. He ordered a burger made with grass fed 
beef. 

We waited what seemed to be forever for our food. This surprised me because on other occasions we were served faster.  I forgot to take photos of the food because we were so hungry by the time they arrived. My order was well presented with a generous three eggs (I ordered over easy and they were cooked perfectly). The corned beef was cut up with onions and potatoes plus there was a small side of hash browns. They even added a skewer of fruit kabob. The bagel was toasted but not buttered and came with cream cheese with no butter on the side. If I was planning to eat it there I would have complained but it was fine for us. Bottom line, the food was good and the price was right ($10 special). 

My husband's burger came with fries and one side and he had coleslaw. He complained to me that the bun was falling apart but the burger was tasty. The fries stood out as some of the best here in Vegas. 

We were asked once if we needed anything but once we were done eating we were ignored and had to eventually request our check and take home box. The portions were so large we took home half the burger and my dish (and the bagel). 

Food wise, we will come back. Service wise, we will not go there if we have limited time. Bagel wise, certainly not the best but standards are lowered here in the desert."}
{"text":"Came for a breakfast business meeting today.   Everything was fresh.  Love that you get free bagel chips with the flavored cream cheese of the day.  Today was pecan sweet potato.     Service a bit slow.  Had to ask for coffee 3 times and cream twice.   Bathrooms not clean.  Floor in stall so wet with ?? that I had to roll up my pants to ensure that my cuffs didn't get dirty."}
{"text":"I wish Bagel Cafe was closer to where I live. It would be my go to spot for any of my meals for the day.

We walk in after an early morning in the snow.  What a perfect place to get warm and have a good meal.  The place was packed and we had to search for a table.  Which we found way in the back.  We were lucky as it seemed there were more people looking for tables as well.  Anyhow, we sit and looked at the menu.  She always knows what she wants so it was really just me looking at the menu.  She got the Matzaball soup and some sort of spinach pastry, the little one a halla bagel with cream cheese, and I got eggs and potatoes.  I'm a sucker for breakfast.  

The waitress was nice and took care of our needs.  Afterwards we looked at the bakery.  So much to choose from.  We brought home bagels, cookies, some sort of fruit filled pastry that was sweet and delicious, and an eclair.  So good... 

I have also had their chocolate cupcake in a different experience.  The eclair trumps it."}
{"text":"I don't have a whole lot to say about my recent trip this time... my dad decided to stop and get lunch to go and I ordered a Turkey on rye with mayo. I got a literal fist sized portion of Turkey in between 2 slices of rye with no mayo. The Turkey that bulky was super dry and I had to use a lot of mustard to help eat it. I honestly ended up removing half of the meat because no one can eat what they gave me practically... the slaw was average. I assume it's out of a bag. Aside from that this place still doesnt impress me. I'd never give my money to people who insult anyone with special needs but that's just me and I'm still pissed about hearing that conversation from last visit."}
{"text":"Didn't care for this place to much, do not order the pastrami sandwich it was pretty bad ..the cream cheese taste super weird and the pickles hade a weird taste to them also.. I rather eat Weiss deli in Henderson"}
{"text":"The food is typically good, exactly what I would expect from a New York style deli, service on the hand; that's a whole other story and that's the basis for this review.  Over the years I've lived in town, which has been since 1995, I've eaten at this place numerous times. Occasionally service is pretty good but most of the time the service is way off.  Slow and poor. Today was no exception, the restaurant was fairly busy so we didn't mind waiting for a table, however it took an exorbitant long time to get our order taken once we were seated. The food came at a reasonable time but the order wasn't accurate. When we were ready to leave it took forever to finally get the check, we asked three people and sat for over 20 minutes trying to get somebody to get us a check; they wouldn't. We finally got up and waited in line to pay at the counter.  Once we got up to the counter to pay, which is something our waitress should have taken care of, the guy ringing just walked away!!  That leaves one person at the register and a whole extra line of people.   

I'm never going back regardless of whether I like the food or not.  The service is so poor for  what you pay there's just no reason to go there anymore. 

Plus: I find them to have a horrible attitude towards consumers. Notations on the menu like \"one check per table, no splitting checks\", \"$2 charge for plate splitting\"... Little rules and irritants. On the surface these dont sound like  big deals but when you couple it all with their poor service and their generally snotty attitude...well, screw 'em; I don't need 'em."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years and years. It is without a doubt the best corned beef sandwich place in Vegas. Actually the BEST deli here. Matzo ball soup a must!!!!"}
{"text":"This is heaven. on. Earth. (...and I'm NOT making a pun about the older clientèle.)

There's the deli, fresh baked goods, and obviously the restaurant itself (which is rather large).  I looked at the menu, and almost had a heart attack. The selection was so good that I was almost afraid to order anything. Everything looked DELICIOUS!  I was on a diet, so I grabbed some things from the deli (they were very, very good), and ran away.  I'm still waiting to grow the balls to go back.

The only downside is that the cashier(s?) are pretty worthless.  I watched 3-4 girls standing around behind the counter about 5 feet away from me, talking for a good 5 minutes without so much as a sideways glance.  I don't think I've ever had so much trouble getting an ice cube in my life."}
{"text":"OMG I would eat here everyday if I could.

I've been a few times now when visiting my parents, and everything on the menu has been outstanding.  The bagels are delicious and fresh.  I'd highly recommend the jalapeno cheddar bagel or everything bagel - yum.  I'm returning next week and am already thinking about what I want to get..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Food, service, layout. Menu is running over. I mean from at least 30 different types of bagels to smoked fish. Omelets, pancakes, waffles and Benedicts. This is just the breakfast portion of the menu. My beautiful one had the veggie omelet with wheat toast also came with fresh fruit. Omelet came out packed with mushrooms, tomatoes, bell peppers onions.  I had a corned beef omelet with plenty of cheddar garlic bagel with garlic cream cheese. Look food is awesome one of the top 5 places to eat breakfast in Vegas."}
{"text":"Love this place. Reminds me of home and how good bagels are. Everything comes in  a huge portion and its always delicious. They have a great selection of break fast and lunch items to choose from so no issues here with variety. 

My favorite things here are the huge sandwiches and the home made desserts. Their fries are good too and I'm not even a fry person.  They have home made should everyday as well as gravy which I get sometimes.  Also the Challah French toast is thick and awesome if that's your thing. Make sure you get fruit on it because it doesn't cone with it. 

For their desserts you cannot miss the home made cheese cake our tiramisu. Seriously too die for. I come here maybe once a month but I'd come  more often if it was closer to where I am all the time. This place is a must try."}
{"text":"This place is reliably great! The servers are always friendly. The food is on the mark. Authentic and delicious."}
{"text":"Second time for breakfast and the food is still
Great.
The prices are good too because you get a bagel with every dish. Plus bagel chips as you wait for your food. Sooooo much food.
Service is very friendly.
Food comes out hot but coffee is not good. 
Lots of cream! Lol 
Don't be in a rush when you come because they are always busy. Enjoy the company and good food. 
Thank you"}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome especially to me because I am an ethnic Jew and grew up in delis like this one.  The bagels are to die for, the entrees are traditional, very well-done and very filling, and the matzo ball soup is amazing.  I also found out that the owners of this restaurant are involved in (probably own but I am not sure) the deli at South Point and Red Rock, both of which have ridiculously good bagels, soup, desserts, and everything in between.

If you are a fan of real boiled bagels with fresh cream cheese, big sandwiches with fresh pastrami and corned beef, and a huge selection of delicious desserts, you should absolutely check the Bagel Cafe out.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Omg, go here immediately and order the brisket.  Just get the whole order because it's the best thing you will ever eat.  Not kidding.  And there is something about the water because it's the best water in LV!  And the cheesecake?!?  Life changing!  After you eat head to the deli and get some bagels and cream cheese to go!

Or get their omelet (any and all of them!) and ask for a side of hollandaise sauce!  It's, oddly, one of my favorite keto friendly restaurants!"}
{"text":"Yum. I don't know what a authentic NY bagel is..but this place does a fantastic breakfast with over a dozen different types of fresh bagels. All sorts of NY deli type dishes and a wall of bakery desserts."}
{"text":"It's was really good food. Slow service, huge portions 

Got to see the mayor's, so it must be good. This place is pricey"}
{"text":"My husband and I discovered this place a few years back, and I have yet to review! Long overdue.

This is the BEST place in Las Vegas to get bagels.  (We are originally from New York, so we know good bagels.)  The bagels here are huge, and so soft on the inside.  The dough is delicious.  They also have a large variety of flavored cream cheeses. 

Their selection of bakery cookies and pastries is large, and they're delicious too! 

We have come here for breakfast and lunch, and every time it's delicious.  Here's what you should try:
Bagels
Matzohball soup
Chocolate ruggalah
Pickles
Any sandwich!

I wasn't a big fan of the egg slad, but it's because I like really wet egg salad and theirs is more traditionally dry. 

Service is always great.  It's a bit more pricey, but you're getting quality food that you can't find anywhere else."}
{"text":"If you want a nice breakfast out in Vegas, go here. Their bakery and deli counter is the best feature of this place; they have a huge selection of decadent desserts, meatz, cheezez, and of course, bagelz. It's easy and quick to get your order and get out when ordering at the counter. The last time we went there my gal and I got a raspberry (strawberry? can't remember exactly) danish and it was pretty damn good. I'm sure there are some desserts in there that are a bit dry but overall it's a win-win. I'd prefer to get a bag o' bagels over dining in and getting a bagel entrée.

Sunday morning breakfast is a nice atmosphere because it's quite bustling--however, it might be a while before you are seated and the service may seem a bit moony and often cold. I suggest getting an omelette when dining in with a side bagel if you're dying for a nice big breakfast because the other big breakfasts aren't really that appetizing. Not that the omelettes are supermodels, but they're pretty great.

Overall, it's a pretty good place. If you're visiting LV, it's far enough away from the strip that it makes it nice to get away from that snake-pit but close enough that you don't have to drive hours for a simple meal. Good luck finding a place to park as their lot sux and is surrounded by dentists."}
{"text":"One of the best places to go for breakfast. Food is yummy yummy.  It is a like a real New York diner.  My husband and I love it.  We always get the spinach feta omelet. Mmmmmmmm. I also love the honey wheat bagel with strawberry cream cheese. The staff is great and they get to know the regular customers, which is really nice."}
{"text":"I've visited 3 times now and not extremely happy with the level of customer service. My servers always seemed as though they are in a hurry to go some where. Usually behind the partition so they can chit chat with fellow workers. They do not try to up sell or explain the menu. Just uncanny that they are always in a hurry to get to the other side of the room. I haven't be able to figure that out yet. The condiments could be wiped free of finger prints and old dried ingredients. They do however stop by occasionally to make sure you're doing ok. My meal took exceptionally long this time and the restaurant was busy at all. All of about 10-12 customers. I ordered a patty melt, which was tasteless and had enough cheese to kill a senior citizen. Cole slaw, also no flavor, however my fries we good, not hot, but good. My server stopped by to check on things and left my bill. I immediately put my cc in the holder and waited for my server to come back. Finally she returned, took the bill and cc and dropped it off to the cashier. I watched the cashier complete the transaction and place my cc and receipts directly behind her on a ledge. There it sat, and I waited for my server...and waited...and waited...never to return, honestly. I went up to the cashier and told her that was my cc and receipts behind her, and thankfully she asked me for ID to make sure. I signed and left 20% gratuity for the \"ghost server\" anyway. So I think I will do take out next time. Maybe corned beef, or roasted turkey sandwich."}
{"text":"As I am from NYC area, finding a good deli/bagel is a hard thing to come by.
Bagel Cafe comes very close. The bagels are very good, they have the cookie bar that compares favorably to deli's back east, their Challa is excellent and makes fantastic french toast, and they have a vast variety of cream cheeses.

The dining area is a great place to enjoy some good Matzoh Ball soup, however, it is a very busy soup with noodles and carrots drowning out the small matzoh ball. (A good Matzoh Ball soup should have the Matzoh Ball on display in the middle of the soup.)

I was not impressed with the Corned Beef sandwich, nor did I think I would be having yet to find quality corned beef outside of NY or to a lesser extent, LA.
What was disappointing is the photo on the menu appeared to be piled high but the sandwich I received had a much more pedestrian helping of Corned Beef, most likely due to the rising cost of meat.   The rye bread was cut too thick and overpowered the sandwich but was a tasty bread in and of itself.

I do enjoy that they sell Dr. Brown's black cherry soda, Wise potato chips, and day old bagel chips and breads.  The deli meat counter however is often overpriced for the same boar's head meat you can get at the supermarket and the Lox prices are extremely high.  But go with a lox cream cheese which has large chunks of lox but is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I figured since I learned I need to get my wisdom teeth pulled late this afternoon, I may as well get my grub on considering I will be food deprived for some time.  Best believe this afternoon I will be back for round two somewhere.  Although, known for their kosher offerings, I figured I could get some lox on one of the final weeks of lent Fridays.

So I opted for none other than...the waitresses recommendation on the best breakfast.  I believe the waitresses name is Nancy and was very sweet and sociable.  However, she did remind me of the sister of a co worker who is also very sweet, yet, a little broke down, not body odor conscious and has had a streak of bad luck.  Luckily, I try not to make a correlation with negativity, but it was hard not to notice the resemblance.  

Needless to say, Nancy recommended the crab cake benedict, and if y'all have read my previous reviews in the past, I have been known to have a soft place in my heart for benedict style breakfasts.  

The dish came out in a timely manner and commenced the destruction of the meal.  The dish came with two crab cake benedicts that were good portions, not too small, not gigantoid.  The dish was accompanied with a side of country style potatoes that were yummy as well.  This is the Friday before Good Friday and my no meat lent restrictions are nearly complete.  

The benedicts were filled with an above average crab cake, composed of real crab meat, how do I know you ask?  Well if you hit an occasional bit of shell, chances are the mofo is authentic.  The chunks were a generous size as well.  Holandaise sauce was good to go, not overwhelming or invisible, just right.  The price is the other indicator that the crab meat was real and not faux.  Priced at $14ish, the dish better have included real crab meat, right?!  Not quite as good as Maryland Crab Shack, which I still have a discount coupon for, but a close runner up.

Following the meal, my patnah and I notice that one of our \"indirect\" bosses showed up and my homie began to slide under the table.  I see nothing wrong with staying nutritionally adequate to perform our work duties and was tryna holla at him, yet with his stunnas on, it appeared that he was tryna keep it on the low pro.  

Anyhow, I later learned that you are not supposed to eat six hours prior to getting oral surgery, so if I choke on the crab cakes coming back out, nancy is my coworker reincarnated to punish me for my comments about her in this review."}
{"text":"What a welcome retreat just a quick drive from the craziness of the strip.  Desperate for anything not in a casino, I went twice this past week for breakfast and both times it was excellent.  Very busy spot with an excellent waitstaff that greets you warmly and gets the coffee flowing while you consider breakfast options.

The menu is pretty extensive with many great sounding options.  On my first visit I went with a corned beef hash omelette (which is not on the menu but they were able to whip it up for me) and even though I am always hesitant to order a bagel anywhere that is not Long Island, this place had me feeling good so I went for it - everything toasted with scallion cream cheese.  Excellent all around - everything fresh and prepared to order. 

Came back later in the week needing another escape from the glitter and noise.  This time I was heading to the Red Rock Conservation area for a hike and needed some fuel.  This is on the way if you are coming from the Vegas strip area, but I would have come even if it weren't.  This time I went veggie omelette and a salt bagel with cream cheese and bacon.  Once again, excellent all around - great food, great service and just an excellent overall experience. 

While Vegas is not on my favorites list, so glad I found a spot to get away when business calls me there.  

As someone who never thought you could get a great bagel off Long Island, Vegas is probably the last place on earth I would have expected to prove me wrong!"}
{"text":"The Bagel Cafe is a dependable spot to eat great food in my neck of the woods, but I don't come here that often because, let's face it, I have no self control.  If they didn't  have a bakery, I'd probably be safe, but I just cannot resist!
So, a friend and I had breakfast this morning.  I thought I'd be healthy and ordered a veggie omelet with a whole wheat bagel.  Oh, it came with home fries, but I think potatoes are also a vegetable.  Anyway, that was delicious and very filling.  After paying our bill at the counter, my gal pal had to scoot, so she left me to \"browse\" the bakery area.  Well, browsing turned to buying, which turned into another instance of me facing my weakness for sugar. At least I had vegetables before the carbs were ingested.  See my pics for a couple of the pastries the cafe has to offer.  There's more to choose from, but you'll just have to go and see for yourself; I had to get out of there before I turned into a diabetic."}
{"text":"Sat down on a Saturday afternoon and the place was packed! 
Surprisingly we got seated very quick, had our drinks brought and also a delicious cream cheese with bagel chips to enjoy.
Waitress was very nice and polite, and my Reuben was superb! Half of it went to go since it was fairly big.

Big shoutout to the manager PABLO! Very polite and attentive, making sure we are enjoying our lunch, and brought my daughter crayola and drawing paper to keep her entertained .
Thank you very much Pablo for your attention, we had a great lunch! 

Overall great spot with great customer service ( no wonder why they're always busy) will be back again."}
{"text":"I have a newly restored opinion of the Bagel Cafe now. This is the BEST Jewish deli in Vegas so far. I have tried a few and this has the BEST food a d bakery items by far. All the breakfast and lunch options are great. Meats are of very good quality now.Weiss deli has better rye bread. I think when Canters opens up down the street in Tivoli Village , they will have some serious competition though. Canters is a legendary great place for food. Bagel Cafe is also awesome !!"}
{"text":"I am from NYC, very nice decor in the inside reminds me of home with the deli and dessert counter . Everything bagel is missing the salt that's the only critique. Otherwise their bagels is the closest you can get for a chewy NYC bagel anywhere else in Vegas."}
{"text":"Never a huge fan of Bagel Cafe, but it has been the only traditional Jewish Style deli in the Summerlin area. They must know that formidable competition is opening soon and yet, when my  corned beef sandwich came with a twist tie in the coleslaw, their reaction was...\"Oh, sorry, the bread is stored above the prep area so it can happen.\"
We didn't make a fuss with staff at the time, except to say they probably shouldn't have changed extra for the coleslaw, but I wrote to owners and have received no response. Apparently, they do not care about making a customer comfortable that the situation was taken seriously and remediated or extending any compensation at all for the unpleasant experience of chewing down on a twist tie in your sandwich!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place.  Bagelmania is much better.  Had the 1/4lb corned beef.  Beef was not well spiced,  bread was soggy.  Cole slaw was boring,  needed some seasoning. . Pickle was Decent. . Guys had bagels and cream cheese. . Nothing really great. . Won't be back"}
{"text":"Went there this morning...hadn't been in a while and ordered lox and bagel platter on whole wheat.  When I got to work nd opened sandwich..this is what I had for 12.95 ( + 1.00 for nova cream cheese which I requested).  For $14.01 I was thoroughly disappointed.  I called back and asked what the small fish platter consisted of..
Lettuce, onions, tomatoes pickles and capers which I did not receive.
Thoroughly disappointed with my $14 breakfast.  
P.S. cashiers did not look or greet me when giving order"}
{"text":"The Bagel Cafe is a fantastic place for breakfast and lunch. The food is always fresh and delicious. The servers are attentive and friendly as they make their way around the huge dining room. Be careful though when you go to the front to pay, if you wander over to the Deli, you're liable to double or triple your bill :)"}
{"text":"We had heard amazing things about The Bagel Cafe, and a couple weeks ago when we were looking for a taste of home we decided to give it a try.  Over all it was a positive experience, but there were some things that caused me to shake my head a bit.
The positives:
- The bagels were delicious and just like back east! 
- Our server was very friendly and attentive
- Their deli counter was very impressive, and provided a lot of to-go options
- Their portion size was very generous and we ended up taking a good bit of our fish platter home
- They started us off with some bagel chips and pineapple/coconut cream cheese which was excellent

The Negatives:
- They were very rigid as far as the menu went.  The waiter had to check and make sure they could do certain things.  This sometimes is a red flag.  I am the customer, charge me more if you have to, but give me what I want!
- We got a slice of banana cream cake and a frosted cookie (free with a yelp check-in).  The cake was just ok, and the cookie was almost tasteless 

Overall, I would definitely return to Bagel Cafe (especially to pick up a dozen), but I there are other places in town to to better get that taste of home!"}
{"text":"We have frequented the Bagel Cafe for years. We lived down the street for 10 years and ate here almost every sunday. When we bought our home 20 min away....the fact that we weren't going to be near the cafe was part of the discussion about if we would move or not. We've never had dinner, but breakfast and lunch are a staple. Amazing bagels, and the biggest French toast in town. We love it and you will too."}
{"text":"Glad to have this wonderful deli in my neighborhood.  Not only great bagels but delicious pastries and meats.  The menu specials are always super and the early bird specials are one of the best bargains in town.  Can get noisy when crowded so I often opt of odd hours when the place is much quieter.  The soup and salad special, smoked fish, matza ball soup, breakfast egg dishes and various cream cheese and bagel options keep me coming back for more.  Don't confuse The Bagel Cafe at the Suncoast with the quality of food and service at the one on Buffalo."}
{"text":"Seriously I can't even explain how great everything was. The bagels to no surprise are incredible. I went went Sunday afternoon after the rush had died down with a friend. I had the Greek salad with chicken it was huge! With a sun dried tomato and cream cheese. She had a soup. Didn't try it but it looked Yums. Got a Rueben with turkey. Everyone was really friendly and helpful. I am super excited to go back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is really excellent for breakfast.  The menu is cute and creative and they have many options to chose from.  They provide a variety of bagels alwith all types of schmears to choose from.  Their meals portions are huge and one omelet can easily feed two people.  This is just down the road from me and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The bagel cafe was an amazing find! Recently relocated to Vegas from NJ and these are really just as awesome as a New York Bagel! They are definitely a little pricey, but if you want an authentic taste of NYC this is it! High quality, fresh delicious bagels! In addition to great bagels, this place also sells 'wise' potato chips.. Love having a taste of home!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre, however the manager and counterman were extremely rude. We ate dinner and wanted to buy a chicken soup to go. We ordered it from the counterman and as I don't like vegetables I asked him if he could do his best to not get too many in my order. He rudely told me he could not do that. We said that our waitress had done a great job of that. The manager than rudely ran over yelling that the waitress could be fired for that and we should never ask again. I did not realize what a crime it was to ask them to go light on the veggies. Then when we were paying the bill (the manager is also the cashier) he told me that this was the owners wishes. I said the owner was an idiot for not trying to please his customers and the battle escalated from that. There are many restaurants competing for my $ in vegas, there is no need to go where you are treated rudely."}
{"text":"LOVE IT HERE!!! awesome service!! Pastrami sandwich is so good!!  Better than Katz in New York!! Bagels are amazing!! And the scallion cream cheese is so good!! Also the baked goods are to die for!! Love the rainbow cookies!! Also the pecan tools are so good and the palmier.. I could go on and on!! Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This is a go to restaurant for every New Yorker that wants to feel like they're in a New York Deli. The New York knishes, deep-fried, are really good. The kishka with brown gravy is delicious as well. The quality of the pastrami is no better than a packaged pastrami. They give you plenty of it though. When I ordered the pastrami on rye, I need to have it shaved super thin to not be tough. The chicken soup is too greasy for my taste. Coffee's good and they have Dr browns."}
{"text":"Best bagels and home made corned beef hash! Great BIG salads, yummy treats, all in one place!"}
{"text":"Easily the best bagels in Las Vegas. They aren't NY bagels, but nothing is. The counter (to-go) staff is quick and efficient. There's never much of a wait. 

The sit down area is hit and miss from what I can tell. The waitresses are all nice, but not ways fast. 

Lastly, if you're ever feeling old go here on a Sunday before 9am and you'll feel young again. It seems as if the minimum age is 80."}
{"text":"Me and my son went there because i have been hearing so many good things about it, well we both ordered country fried steak, neither one of us liked it, tasted horrible so we left 2 full plates of food, waiter didnt even ask if there was a problem, any other business would have, so we just wont go back If he would have haf any concern i might, just might give it another try but no thanks


SAVAAS, i am trying to repond to you but i dont see anywhere after your comment so hope u see this, it was 05/042018 my son closed on his first home so we went there right after, i wanna say around 1230 -100pm and i dont remember the guys name who served us but i do remember what he looks lime if i saw him, anyways we like to try new things out but was just disappointed all the way around with no concern, thats what bothered me!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in vegas! Food is amazing and the portions are very generous."}
{"text":"I love this place. Nothing is more effective than the lox and bagels here for making me nostalgic about my childhood. The food, the service, the unlimited coffee refills, the 14 bagel baker's dozen...I could go on...basically, this place is popular and that popularity stems from being great at everything they do!"}
{"text":"Hey Bagel lovers!!!

I've been missing New York bagels and been on a quest to find my go to bagel shop! After a quick search on yelp and all the awesome reviews... I found BC.

Came here for breakfast recently with a gf of mines. We dined in and ordered the chocolate chip with strawberry cream cheese and egg bagel with strawberry cream cheese. We also decided to try out the potato pancake since it was a popular menu item on yelp reviews.

Food was ok. Service could have been way better. Our waitress forgot about us throughout our meal. lame! On the positive side, there was no wait to be seated! and the guy behind the counter gave me his honest option and told me the blueberry bagel batch wasn't looking good that morning. 

Would I come back? Probably not. Unless I'm driving by and craving a bagel, BC wouldn't be my ideal spot for breakfast.

Love the cool newspaper menu and all of the yummy carby treats in the glass window.

If you love big bagels and live in the area, stop by BC.

- Miss Yelp 2011"}
{"text":"Recently moved to this area, so I finally decided to try this place. I just needed some breakfast so I ordered eggs, bacon, fruit cup, and a bagel. Add cup of coffee, $13.25. Bacon was small, only 2 strips, eggs were small. Fruit cup was tiny...maybe 6 pieces. The bagel was ok. Not worth the $$ and probably won't return since there are so many other better choices."}
{"text":"The best deli sandwiches and desserts in this side of town!!!  Love their matzah ball soup too!!! The Roast beef and raw onions on a pumpernickel bread with deli mustard is my favorite!  My Dads is the pastrami on rye with deli mustard! Great desserts, fav' chocolate croissant and yin yang cookie! Definitely go when friends or Family are in town!  Wish they were open later and Sundays."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love this place! Why 2 stars? Because the people who answer the phone are as dumb as dumb and rude as rude can be! It cost you you a catering order today! Wasn't just one it was 2 different people 2 separate calls!"}
{"text":"I had heard of the bagel cafe from my wife's sister when she came and helped us move. She had said she definitely recommended it. So since it was my mother's birthday and my wife and I wanted to take her out for a morning breakfast we decided to try the bagel cafe.

When we arrived we definitely noticed that the parking spots were for compact vehicles, since there was someone who didn't get that message and had their 1 ton truck taking up 2 parking spots. After finding a parking spot we walked in and were quickly greeted and found a spot to sit. It was my first time to this location so I was not sure if this was like a sandwich shop a pastry shop or a restaurant, well apparently it's all in ONE which is quite awesome I love one stop shops. 

After being seated we sat and waited at the table for menus. The bus boy came and asked if we wanted drinks. We ordered 1 coffee and 2 waters and again we waited. The waitress came with a pen and pad and asked us if we were ready to order. We all said we were waiting for the menus. She quickly apologized and informed us that the menus were located at the end of the table and was newspaper like menus. 

We looked through the menu which seemed a bit long for a breakfast/lunch establishment I believe that even in the last pages there were dinner plates which confused me a bit as there not open past 5. 

We ordered a cup of Matzo Ball soup, a biscuits and gravy plate, a corn beef hash and egg plate and one fresh veggie omelet. The matzo ball soup came with one ignoramus matzo ball and it was piled high with vegetables and chicken. My mom being the very whitey person that she is quickly reminded me how she had made me a similar soup when I was a kid and how I complained to her that what she served me was clearly not matzo ball soup and it was chicken noodle soup with a matzo ball in it LOL! Well that's exactly what I got here. My mom is a sous-chef at petrossian bar at the Bellagio and she drilled me at how matzo ball soup can be made in many different ways. Well I don't prefer this kind all though it was hearty and the matzo ball was delightful. I still prefer a matzo ball soup with just matzo ball not with chicken and vegetables. The portions reminded me allot of hash house a go go. The portions were rather big and hearty. The biscuits were soft and the gravy was very exquisite a change from hash house because there biscuits seemed to be a bit hard and these were really soft and awesome when paired with the gravy. The veggie omelet was a veggie omelet nothing spectacular. The corn beef hash was tasty especially coming from me because I'm not a corn beef fan and this one was defiantly cooked correctly and seasoned just right.

I think the customer service was sub-par. I could tell that the waitress was definitely trying to be nice and helpful however I felt at times I was forgotten we only had 1 water refilled and my mother's coffee was never refilled or even offered to be refilled. We might possibly try them again."}
{"text":"My wife who has been here several times for breakfast wanted to take me here for lunch because she noticed the tongue sandwich on the menu a real favorite of mine. We showed up around noon time on a Friday afternoon and the place was packed but were seated within ten minutes. My wife ordered a Reuben and I ordered the tongue tip. Our waitress returned a bit later to tell me they were out of tongue tip and regular tongue. I asked if this was normal and she couldn't really say. I settled on a philly cheese steak. All I can say is both sandwiches were a disappointment. Small servings and the philly might have just been two pieces of bread and a sprinkling of meat. Onions, peppers, cheese?  To beat it all on our way out we saw a sign on the door that said this is a place of peace no firearms. When will people learn that criminals don't read or care about signs. My wife and I were both armed and managed to get through our sub par meal without disturbing anyone. Armed citizens are a deterrent to crime and not a danger. If you want to prevent lawful CCW post your sign better. As per the law. I guess I'll never get to find out about that tongue sandwich now. Bummer!"}
{"text":"You will not find a better bagel shop outside of New York than this one. And if you're a fan of sweets, get ready for a ride. They do nothing in moderation. You'll get a half pound of creme cheese on your bagel, and if you dare to order from the bakery you better have a friend to help you eat whatever you order. The apple turnovers are bigger than an iPad. This place is a legit jewish deli and they take it seriously. 

The only other thing to note is that this place is so good its also very very busy. I hardly ever try to eat in the restaurant unless I can get there at the crack of dawn. Better to grab a bagel from the deli and go sit in the park. Parking is tight so avoid coming in a giant vehicle."}
{"text":"What's not to like about matzoh ball soup or chicken soup? Both are recommended for the soul and for cool afternoons. Always a stomach warming experience."}
{"text":"A long long time ago. In a city far away, I moved to Vegas and ate a bagel. 

It was a 5 year experience that I'm glad that I had. Among many of the places I patronized while I lived there was the Bagel Cafe. 
I stumbled across it with the help of a friend. Okay, we were driving by and saw it. The rest is history. 
Fast forward 256 years into the future (sometimes it feels like that) and my wife and I are in Vegas for a whirlwind conference. Unfortunately, like most times, we didn't have time to do much. But, we were leaving sin city on a Friday morning and my wife wanted to stop one of the places I used to haunt. 
I forgot the name! :(  Quickly, I grabbed my phone and Googled Bagel Summerlin. The name and address came up and voila, it was JUST as I remembered. Deli in the front and seating in the back.

The first thing you notice is the place is clean. 
The second thing you notice is the staff is friendly. 
My wife ordered a full pastrami sandwich on marble rye.
I ordered a tongue sandwich on traditional rye. 
I asked the waiter if the tongue was fresh and he said yes. 
In about 10 minutes, the sandwiches were delivered.
My mouth is watering thinking about it now, several days later!
The pastrami was very good. Almost as good as a place I know in the Valley. The tongue was exceptional. Good taste, tender, and soft. 
The sandwich was almost too big for my mouth. It was delicious!
The only thing I didn't care for was the rye. Yes, they make their own rye, but it was too soft and squishy. I like a rye with a descent crust and a heavier rye flavor. But, that's me. The rye, as a bread goes, still was very fresh.
My sandwich was GONE is short order. My wife took 1/2 her sandwich to eat 7 hours later on the drive home.

----------------
Bottom Line

The Bagel Cafe is good. I take that back, it's GREAT!
The best time to go is during the week. Weekends were way TOO busy from my recollection, but should that stop you? No! Go anyway. A crowded deli is part of the New York experience!

Yes, I will go back when I'm in Vegas again!!!
When are you guys opening one in Reno??"}
{"text":"Didn't eat in the café, but got some baked goods to go.   Growing up on the East Coast, I really miss the good bakeries.  We stumbled upon this place after a search for black and white cookies.   After looking at the photos, we had to stop by and get some.    On the first trip there, I got a black and white cookie and a few macaroons.   The macaroons were awesome.   The black and white cookies were pretty good.   It was definitely enough to warrant another trip.  
The second trip, we got some more black and white cookies to take home along with some raspberry linzer tarts and a raspberry rugalah.   Yummy!   They were all really good.   
If you are from the East Coast, or just like good baked goods,  give this place a try.  
Will I be back?  Sure, I have to try some of the other items they have there!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  For a cafe, the quality and portion size is great.  There were 3 of us that came to eat for the first time and we all agreed to come back again, soon!

They use fresh deli meat for their sandwiches.  I had the Roast beef, my fiancée had the pastrami, and my friend ordered the corn beef.  All was delicious.  

The service was decent, pretty much what you would expect from a cafe.   

Their bakery is also pretty great.  It's only our first time, so we didn't buy a lot from the bakery.  But we did buy a few desserts (tiramisu, carrot cake, cheesecake cupcake & cannoli).  We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Yup yup! Awesome place. Hot Tongue on rye and a side of chopped chkn liver is my fav!  I love this place!"}
{"text":"I just had my introduction here for lunch today, and came away satiated and very impressed.   The list of available food choices in the newspaper menu is ginormous, and includes everything from breakfast omelets to a myriad of combinations of meat sandwiches , and even three types of pickles: a sliced whole Kosher Dill, bright green New Pickle spears, and pickle chips.  Step over from the dining room to the glass display cases near the entrance, and, in addition to several varieties of cream cheeses, a large array of pastry delicacies beckon, ranging from Seven-Layer Chocolate Cake to the largest Black and White Cookies I have to date seen.

Although I enjoy eating Nova Lox on a cream-cheesed bagel about once a week, when I go to a deli I am generally looking for a heaping meat-filled deli sandwich on rye.  So, foolishly I suppose, for years I was put off by the \"Bagel\" in the restaurant's title.  Now that I know better, I expect to get my deli fix here on about a bimonthly basis.  Although I found the Matzoh Ball Soup and corned beef to be on the same par as found at Carnegie Deli at The Mirage, here I will not have to pay an exorbitant valet parking fee for the pleasure of dining on the Strip, and I can get my mouth around the 1/4 pound sandwich halves--albeit barely so.  

My cup of Matzoh Ball Soup was excellent, except it could have used a bit more salt.  The Kosher Dill spears were right on, and the New Pickle spears barely ripe, as is normally the case.  The corned beef in my Corned Beef on Seeded Rye was moist and lean, just as I hoped, and the bread was also first rate.  Potato Salad and Cole Slaw were both creamy and delicious, and the French Fries of a superior grade.  Accompanying bagels were oversize and  noticeably fresh, and although my party of four hardly needed them, an assortment of bagel chips served with a pile of gray cream cheese were tasty as well.  I dressed up my sandwich with mild yellow mustard--although spicy mustard is also available--and luscious chopped liver.  By ordering an appetizer plate of Chopped Liver I could mete out what I wanted to smear on the rye with a table knife, and thus avoid a 1/2 & 1/2 deli sandwich combo, in which case I would be downing a quarter-pound of the artery-clogging organ meat.

It was a great tummy-filling lunch!  And my seat mates were equally pleased with their selections: a Tuna Salad Melt on Marble Rye, a Combo Corned Beef And Pastrami on Rye, and a Roast Beef French Dip with hot au jus and French Fries."}
{"text":"I have been going to the bagel cafe for years. I love the shrimp salad sandwich. They have this display of desserts. Cookies, cake, amazing pasties. They give you large portions."}
{"text":"The prices seem high at first and then you get your plate. HOLY MOLY the portions are huge! I got the fruit parfait and thought \"$10 is a lot for a parfait.\" It was the biggest parfait I have ever seen in my life. I could t finish it! My in laws loved their food and can't wait to go back. I guess there is a reason why this place is a Las Vegas staple.  I'm looking forward to trying more on the menu. Downsides are that the parking lot isn't very big and that it can be a little noisy inside the restaurant. But we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Came in and got some bagels, which are actually not good the second day, unless you freeze them. So, if you want more than a few, you need a big freezer, but they will get freezer burn after a few days anyway.So, it is not worth my time. If you don't eat  it right there and then, it is a rock. The owner's attitude is tangible and avoid it at all costs, if you want to be able to eat. I have been a restaurant manager for well over 20 years, and I know when something is wrong. This place gives me the creeps, now."}
{"text":"The bagels and cinnamon rolls here deserve five stars.

After a morning hike some friends and I arrived at The Bagel Cafe for breakfast. It wasn't super busy yet and we were able to get a table right away. Noted! By the time we left, the place was packed and there was a wait.

I do want to start by saying that all the issues that came up were remedied best they could be, but I still left slightly disappointed. I ordered the egg white omelet and my plate had a hair in the food. This seems to be a trend for me lately when I dine with this group of friends. Also noted! The server took my plate away, was very apologetic, and brought me a new dish as fast as the kitchen could push it out. My replacement omelet was overdone and my bagel was burnt.

Thankfully the cinnamon rolls there saved the day and I will gladly pop in to order all the pastries and bagels to go."}
{"text":"Such a cool place. It's super easy to just order take out! Staff is friendly and the take out orders are always quick! I am extremely simple and I love the blueberry bagels with strawberry cream cheese. And it's delicious! They never disappoint whenever I stop in!"}
{"text":"Moving to Las Vegas from NY, I have been in search of a \"good\" bagel and The Bagel Cafe makes a GREAT bagel! 

It has been everything I was missing in the way of a bagel shop but more with the sit down restaurant and pastries. I would recommend an everything bagel with cream cheese or pick up a variety to take home. 

I can't say much more besides go try it!  I've ran into some celebrities while I have been there and I've loved standing next to them when ordering my bagels because they are just normal people enjoying the same thing."}
{"text":"Ordered a corned beef and pastrami sandwich and fries which tasted just ok. Got home and later that night started feeling nauseous. Ended up having to throw up several times. I had food poisoning from my meal. Brought it to the attention of the manager and owner and he couldn't care less.  Poo-pooed the whole thing (no pun intended). Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"I love the bakery here, although service can be bad, only because they don't really have a good system to order. If you stand in line, and someone else happens to catch the attention of the worker, they'll cut you off and next thing you know, you're the sucker standing in line for 10 min without anyone helping you. Prices are expensive, but whatevs. Not like I come here often enough."}
{"text":"So I've come here quite a few times since my discovery. That says a lot considering I live in the SW so making this drive is a huge effort on my end. From what I understand is this place has been around for quite awhile. 
I've been searching for a good bagel place since I got here and I'm so glad I can finally abandon that mission. This place gets packed on the weekends but for good reason. Expect at least a 20 min wait after 10am. 
They have at least a dozen style bagels fresh and ready at any given time with a healthy selection of shmears. On top of that, lox, cod and more. And on top of THAT(yes, there's more), is a sweets display. Chinese almond cookies, tiramisu, cinnamon rolls, cakes, so on and so forth. This doesn't include the restaurant which has excellent fresh squeezed oj, pancakes, sandwiches, chicken fried steak, omelettes and a plethora of other dishes. Do I really need to say more? Prices are great. Breakfast never exceeds $40 for two with plenty to take home. Service is fast and friendly. Only thing that sucks is parking is cramped. Literally, every spot is compact car size parking so if you have an SUV, prepare for a tight squeeze."}
{"text":"The Bagel Cafe has to be one of the best breakfast (and lunch) spots in Vegas. It has character, they make their customers feel like family and the food is amazing. One of the things I feel like many Las Vegans complain about is the lack of these types of family owned restaurants. Since this is right by my house, I eat there almost 2-3 times per month.

It is perfect for takeout or sit-in, they also have a huge selections of desserts, which are perfect if you just want a little something to crave your sweet tooth or you are looking for a full on cake to bring to a party.

For breakfast I am hooked on the veggie omelet, with sliced tomatoes and an everything bagel. (The lite scallion cream cheese is my weakness!) 

They actually have good strong house coffee too!

For lunch their fresh tuna and egg salad sandwiches are so good and HUGE!

One of things that continues to draw me into this place is that unlike most breakfast places you don't feel like you are consuming a thousand calories! Their food tastes fresh and healthy! Of course if you get Biscuits and Gravy or something like that you are probably looking at a boat load of calories/fat, but overall I don't feel like they cover their food in butter or grease."}
{"text":"The bagels and food are fantastic but the service was pretty rude. The girl at the checkout register clearly did not want to be there today"}
{"text":"The bagel cafe is one of our favorites!  Everyone is friendly, the food is fantastic, and the service is great. We especially love Anna, as she is attentive and incredibly sweet."}
{"text":"I really, really enjoy this place. I can't honestly say that I'm the biggest deli person, but I do love their food. I'm not a big fan of cured meats, so I tend to shy away from the sandwiches. I usually order the french toast or matzo ball soup (minus the noodles). 

Everything here is pretty good. I love me some bagels and this place has a plethora to choose from. Every flavor you can imagine.

The desserts look really good, and if the meal portions weren't so plentiful I'd actually be able to consume one after my meal... lol.

Definitely a safe \"go to\" restaurant."}
{"text":"Best bagels ever.  I ordered the lox and requested that they toast my bagel really well. I got exactly what I asked for. They had fresh coffee, and the ambiance was great.  Loved the photos they had on their overhead TV. Showed lots of platters, and so many different pastries. 

The service was also great. When I visit Vegas again, I will definitely make an attempt to visit them again!"}
{"text":"Crab eggs benedict? 
Yes, please!

I came here for bagels on a Saturday morning and after further studying the menu, I knew I had to return.  And I did. Less than 24 hours later.  We dined in both times. I shared the fish platter (belly lox) with my mom and it was fantastic. The bagels were delicious and the serving of cream cheese is enough to serve 3.  The following day, I returned with the whole family in tow, and tried the Crab eggs benedict.  It was delicious, but the ONLY downfall was that the poached egg was overcooked.  I asked the waitress about it, and she said that is how they normally do it, and next time to specify that I want the runny egg-yolk goodness instead.  The crab cakes were crabulicious and I can just imagine how much more amazing they will be with my yolk of choice.  

My husband and mom both ordered \"Overstuffed Meat Sandwiches\" (pastrami and brisket) and our mouths watered as the tower of meat was served.  They both ordered whole sandwiches and had enough to take home for an afternoon snack.  

The service was quick and very friendly. It is quite the happenin' place (especially around brunch time on the weekends) so I recommend calling in advance to put your name on the list if their is a long wait.  Although if there is a wait, there is a take-out area with displays of bagels and cream cheese, meats, smoked fish, and pastries galore to wet your appetite."}
{"text":"New to the area & this is close. The food selections were plenty & the potato pancakes were excellent. Good service even though they were busy things were great. I will be back."}
{"text":"It good. Good quality. Tasty. They try hard, but it's still not real NY DELI, but it's the best I can find in Vegas

Pastry's are wonderful,  holiday meals are helpful, typical NY attitude from the help..."}
