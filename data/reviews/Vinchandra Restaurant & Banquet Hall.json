{"text":"I consider this to be some of the best Indian food in Toronto. My father took me here on a few occasions while it was still called Bombay Palace (we had the buffet and it was always good back then). 

Yesterday I went back and ordered a la carte; it was delicious! Even better than the buffet. I had the mutter paneer which was some of the best I've ever tasted (if a bit sweet), the only thing that was strange about it was that it had no peas. The person I was with had butter chicken, and she said that it was the second best butter chicken she's ever had.

The guys who run it seem cool as well. Better than the old owners (a couple, the husband was awesome, but the wife was sort of pushy)."}
{"text":"Pathetic Food Ever Had! Totally dis-appointed. Trying to fool Indian people on name of Indian Food."}
{"text":"The last time I ate here was when it was still Bombay Palace and it was definitely great back then. I came for lunch today and can't really say the same. The operating hours showed it opens at 11:30am but the doors were locked at 11:52am. A kitchen worker who was bringing out food saw me and unlocked the door. They were late opening for lunch on this Thu but most of the food was already done upon entering. Felt that the service was going to be mediocre off the bat. Another customer asked about naan and no-one could understand what the server said.

The food is where things get interesting. I'm not sure if they serve some dishes from a specific region but there were dishes which I've never seen in all of my previous visits to other Indian buffets, even compared to large restaurants like Tandoori Flame. It was hit on some items I've never had and a miss on some staples. They had 3 soups which I didn't try. There didn't seem to be much for dessert there than ice-cream, which I passed one.

First the good. Butter chicken was actually very good with bone-in pieces of chicken. Dahl, spinach and fish curries were also good. They also had 2 veg dishes which were dry (no sauce) and cooked in spices. One was chopped green beans and the other a cabbage medley; both were really good and I enjoyed these! The naan was a crispy paratha and was good, not too greasy.

Now the bad. They had mutton biryani and mutton curry. The rice was nice and fluffy but the goat in both was really tough, either it was meat from an older animal or just not cooked enough. Either way, not impressed. The goat curry sauce also had a different taste I'm not accustomed too, I can't really say what it was exactly but it just seemed off and I didn't like it. The first piece of tandoori chicken I had honestly tasted like it was from the previous day, it was cold and dry. I decided to try a second piece on my 2nd plate and it was slightly warm this time and a little more palatable.

I don't think I'll be back and that's a shame as that knocks off the list a restaurant within walking distance of home..."}
{"text":"The overall quality of the food was excellent and authentic. portions sizes were also great.
The service was excellent and the waiter was very friendly. The only con was that the restaurant felt slighlty cramped and uncomfortable. I definetly recomend this restaurant to anybody that wants to experience authentic south indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant on a whim as a last minute idea for a family dinner, and I'm glad we did.  I was pleasantly suprised by it overall!  My parents felt like they were back in Kerala, eating this food.

The service was friendly, however they should work on getting water on the table first thing, we had to ask for that. The food came out in about 15-20 minutes, which was good.

The quality of the dishes were spectacular.  The paratha was so rich and flaky.  The Malabar Shrimp Curry was my favourite,  it had a wonderful rich  coconut flavour,  very delicious. The mutton curry was pretty good.  My complaint with both these curries were that there weren't enough pieces on meat in them. The paper dosa was also delicious.  It was so crispy and a little more buttery than I liked.  It came with some pretty good sambar and two chutneys.  The King Fish Pollichathu was a showstopper, haven't had that since I was in Kerala myself,  I would definitely recommended ordering that. Nothing we ordered was too spicy,  which I appreciated. The last thing we ordered were the mango lassi's, and they were mediocre.

The ambience of the restaurant was nice.  It is not busy at all and we came for a Sunday dinner.  The washrooms need to be fixed up though.

These were a little pricy for the quantity,  but it was worth quality and taste
Shrimp curry - $12.95
Mutton curry - $11.95
Paper dosa - $11.95
Paratha -$2.95 a piece (worth it though)
King Fish Pollichathu -12.95
Lassi - $4.00

{"text":"This place opened up recently and while it has promise I think this place needs some refinements. We ordered three of the veg mains and although the descriptions indicated that they all had different base sauces, they all tasted exactly the same. I think they just use the same sauce for everything or at least the veg dishes. The dishes tasted ok but were too similar. Very one note and disappointing. I also think canned mushrooms were used in the mushroom dish.
Its more like a 2.5. I will try again and hopefully there will be some improvements."}
{"text":"Shit place. I went here in May and bought mutton briyani was good so decided to repurchase it. It didn't even taste like briyani. Uncooked flavorless and too expensive. Please go some where else where better quality food is served!"}
{"text":"I was given a groupon as a gift to this restaurant for dinner for 2 and after reading reviews I was a little hesitant as it seemed like the portion may not be for two people but me and my boyfriend were so pleased with the food and portion. 

To start the presecense when walking in made you feel at home and the smells made you excited to eat there. As well the service was wonderful the sweetest people and very attentive. 

With the group on it included drinks a biryani dish which we got the chicken as well as nann and butter chicken (there were other options from the veg and non veg meals). Everything tasted amazing the spices used were wonderful. Plus desert was a nice treat at the end. 

The place is a little older so don't expect anything renovated it seems most of their business is from the party hall side. Easy accessible from ttc which was a bonus.

4 stars from me very happy customer and we will definitely be back ! If only it wasn't in Scarborough I would be there all of the time."}
{"text":"I saw they had an offer on groupon, it said Royal Indian Feast for two.  When I read the small print it said, one shared rice, one shared chicken, one shared dessert.  How this is a dinner for \"two\".  This is one meal split between two people, but they are making it sound like it's a great deal, like it's two meals (if you say it's dinner for two people, then it should be two meals, not one meal, that's dinner for one).  Conniving, and deceitful.  I won't ever do business with them again."}
