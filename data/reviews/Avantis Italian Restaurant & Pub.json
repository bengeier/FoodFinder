{"text":"Got a to go order of of the VEGETARIAN menu, got home and saw BEEF sunk into my mushroom ravioli. Called and was told if I wanted to drive fifteen minutes they would make me another. HORRIBLE place, the service was slow and my beer was served at the bottom of the keg, when I complained the bartender simply stated \"Oh yeah, we need to change that\" AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"}
{"text":"I bought a half off deal from a website for Avanti's b/c I live in the area and are always looking to try something new. Upon reading the somewhat terrible reviews I was definitely apprehensive going in but made a point to try and form my own opinions.  At first glance the bar was cool - had lots of charm. The dining room, not so much. Huge booths were nice, but the water marks on the ceiling, large scuffs and marks on the walls (is it that hard to paint?) and outdated italian dining decor. It was a poor mans olive garden in that sense - you catch my drift.   My boyfriend and I each ordered a dinner salad before hand. For $2.99 is was very small, but very delicious. I ordered the pan style pizza and he ordered the chicken parm. He said his was very good and mine was also pretty darn tasty. I have no complaints there!   Service was fantastic - our waitress couldn't have been friendlier.  So really my only complaint was the unkempt feel of the restaurant - which is actually a big thing for me when i'm dining so that's why i gave it 3 stars. I'd give it 3.5 if I could."}
{"text":"I ordered a pasta, wow, it was very soggy and soaked in too much Ragu/Prego  Sauce. The pasta does not Look, feel and Taste like from an ITALIAN restaurant. More like a pasta from United airline. Very disappointed especially when you are hungry. $12-$14 pasta"}
{"text":"Server was excelent.  Anticipated needs before i knew i had them.  I had the sausage grinder.  It was huge and delicious.  Everyone was friendly.  If i lived closer i would come again."}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Went there with a co-worker, I had the Lasagna and she had the stuffed ravioli. My lasagna was very good nice filling including beef portion size was just right and best of all it tasted great. The ravioli I caned served on a bed of spaghetti and I was told delicious as well.  The decor to me was old and charming, something I like; big wood beams in the ceiling and  place to relax. Wait staff was very friendly and kept the water glasses filled.  I would recommend this place to anyone while in Verona."}
{"text":"The bar area was nice, but the dining area was off-putting. That side of the restaurant needs repairs and lots of upgrades. The fresh bread was burnt and tough. The table was a bit crumby. I ordered the Shrimp Fettuccine Alfredo, which admittedly was bland. The server and service were great."}
{"text":"I have a gluten and dairy sensitivity. I should have confirmed that the pasta they were putting in front of me was gluten free, but I was famished and didn't, they were busy on a Friday night, so the food took awhile. The server was young and I feel that she didn't take my dietary needs seriously. My food was neither gluten free nor dairy free. I only figured out the pasta was not gluten free because I get severe migraines from regular pasta and flu like symptoms when consuming dairy. Needless to say, I fell ill. After dinner was finished, she handed the bill to me into my hand- even though server manners generally put the bill in front of the gentleman. I did not have my hand out to take it. All in all, although the food tasted great, I will never come to nor recommend a restaurant who will not take dietary needs of their guests seriously. I am also disappointed that the server did not have common server manners."}
{"text":"If you think you might be hungry in several hours, you should definitely come to this restaurant.   Walked in on Saturday night 4/21 and it was packed. Understandable since Vernona is a small town, this is pretty much the only place locals can go \"out on the town\". We were fine with waiting but not when we had to wait 15 minutes only to be seated at a table in the bar near the front windows that had been empty THE WHOLE TIME we stood around waiting to be seated.  The hostess was very unfriendly.  Half of the staff was dressed up and the other half of the staff including the hostess looked like they were about to go to the gym - basketball shorts, sweatpants, gym shoes.   One place setting at our table - never brought a second one. Butter on the table when we sat down - never brought bread but the table of three young blonde girls next to us got some right away (we had same young male waiter).  * 12 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us at our table and take our drink order.  * 14 minutes for us to get our drinks.  * 13 minutes for the waiter to come back to take our food order then realized he forgot his pad of paper to write down the order. My husband and I ordered our appetizer (bruschetta) and entrées all together because everything was taking so long. Entrées were supposed to come with salads.  * 17 minutes went by, glass of wine finish, no salads, no bruschetta. Bruschetta is toasted bread with tomatoes on it. Salads are lettuce with a tomato and dressing on it. Not hard to make, no cooking involved.   We couldn't wait any longer so we threw a $20 down for our wine (which actually only would have been $14) and walked out. We ended up at the only restaurant open at that time of the evening: McDonald's. Never have I been so happy to eat fast food in my life.   If you want to get a quicker meal then might I suggest you buy some seeds and grow your own tomatoes, lettuce, wheat for pasta and raise some cattle for a burger because you'll still eat sooner doing that than if you went to this restaurant.  Oh and please - MY GOD. Please get your piano tuned by a professional."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. We visit every couple weeks. We always have great service, feel extremely comfortable and love the food! We have so many favorites and discover new ones on every visit. Shrimp Alfredo ravioli, French onion soup, seafood chowder, perch fish fry, any pizza, chicken parmigiana and more! Feels like a family place and we love it!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the Verona and I had heard lots of good things about this little Italian Restaurant, so I decided to give it a try with my fiance.  Upon entering the restaurant I thought it was a bit dark, but showed history and had a quite atmosphere. I ordered the Lasagna, Garlic bread and a glass of Chianti.   Immediately I was disappointed by the waitress lack of ability to recommend a glass of wine. I was told, \"yea people order that a lot, but I don't know what its like\". When the wine came I was further disappointed, but the lack of flavor, aroma and peppery bit I was expecting from a Chianti. When I asked if the bottle was old she said yes it was mostly from an old bottle and they opened a new one and mixed with it, \"so it should be fine\", she told me.  Okay bad wine, I can live with it if the food is good I thought to myself. We quietly waited for our food. While we waited we could hear someone, it turned out to be the chef, arguing with a guest. He was trying to tell the guest that Calamari is suppose to be a bit chewy, \"that's just how it is\" he grumbled at her. She further explained that there is a difference between Calamari having texture and it having the same consistency of that of a rubber-band.  Once my good came it good. The lasagna had a nice cheesy toasted top. There was plenty of meat in with the sauce, it tasted to be pork sausage and not just a plain ground beef or pork. Overall, the lasagna was pretty good. The garlic bread, however, was a different story. As soon as I bit into it I noticed a distinct bitter taste, not the same as burnt garlic, but similar. It was so awful I could not eat another bite. It tasted like an awful form of margarine was used with burnt garlic.   Overall, I think the restaurant has so much potential, but they are really slacking in food quality which it seems could stem from a simple lack of skills or knowledge."}
{"text":"average italian fare in the heart of verona.  i used to go here purely for the fact that they served pasta on pasta.  you could get meat or cheese tortellini or ravioli served on a bed of spaghetti -- and i love that idea!  i went back recently for dinner and their had been a few changes. they had added some booths (thumbs up) and the menu was different. i think there must be a wider selection (the menu now was in book form -- previously, it was a single sheet of paper) but most drastically, the tortellinis/raviolis were not served on a bed of pasta!! (also, i do believe the prices went up.  they are definitely higher than the prices listed on their website -- although they may be lunch prices.. . . )  i ended up getting the chicken parm and it was pretty decent.  nothing to write home about -- but pretty good.  my boy got the rib eye (the special of the night) and he said it was to his liking.  his came with garlic mashed potatoes that were good (he loved them) but tasted to me a bit of box potatoes.    ambiance was pleasant, waitstaff friendly, average food. three stars."}
{"text":"It was just okay, but to call it an Italian restaurant is a stretch.  Nothing about the decor feels like an Italian restaurant.  More like \"old barn\" type pub.  The tables and chairs reminded me of Perkins and all the tables were very close to each other.  Plain paper napkins and plastic glasses.  The food was just average, nothing special.  The servers were very pleasant and attentive, so no complaints there.  Probably the best Verona can do in the way of an \"italian\" restaurant so it's fine.  But I won't be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful! GO! Bar area is the best place to eat though. Family restaurant. If you haven't been then go - if you've been - go again. Great daily specials. Love their meatballs!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is more \"Wisconsin Bar\" than Italian restaurant. Country music was playing when we walked in, and there are neon beer signs in the windows which is fine for a bar, but not something you would typically see in an Italian restaurant. That being said, their food wasn't bad. I had the grilled salmon which was served over angel hair pasta with a lemon caper butter sauce. The salmon was over cooked, but the sauce and the pasta was fantastic. My husband had the lasagna and enjoyed that as well. The dinner salad that came with my meal was pretty good, although I would have preferred to have a house vinaigrette instead of the only house dressing option being Ranch. They had a decent beer and wine selection with many local options to choose from.  They seemed really understaffed. There were only two women serving, seating people, and clearing tables. There was a family that walked in while we were eating and left because they were never greeted by anybody, and also multiple tables that needed to be cleared off and weren't cleaned the entire time we were there."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I went to Avanti's for a fish fry last Friday.  I haven't been here in a while but I was surprised to find it fairly empty for 6:30 on a Friday evening in December.  We were very close to leaving for fear it was a sign but glad we stayed.  We started out with a bottle of wine, which was on special and for $21, not bad at all.  It was a nice Malbec and a good value for the price.  We both had the blue gill, which is fried in panko breadcrumbs, with hash potatoes.   I wanted the walleye but our server told us they stopped serving it because the portion was getting smaller and the quality wasn't as good.  So we stuck with the blue gill.  It was a bit fishy but overall, tasty and satisfying.  The hash browns were crisp but not very flavorful and even salt and pepper couldn't really help.  We didn't really have room for dessert but I was forced to order the molten chocolate cake by my fiancee.  All of the desserts are made there except the Tiramisu.  This was fairly good but definitely not in the top 10 molten chocolate cakes I've had.  The service was reasonable for the number of patrons.  All and all it was a fair experience but for Friday night fish fry, there are a lot of better places in the area where waiting at the bar with a drink for a few minutes to get a table is half the experience and worth it!"}
{"text":"Oh my God.  Husband and I ordered cod and waited for over an hour for our food.  The people behind me have waited longer.  They are furious. Food was awful.  One piece of fish was just cartilage. Never coming back. Gross. Plus the server wasn't really nice. I think there is one person only working. The rest just kind of aimlessly wonder around without any food to give people."}
{"text":"Good family Italian fair in the middle of Verona. Dishes are typical pasta with red sauce, but they do it well. Read a few other reviews about issues with service, but did not experience that this night. Our server Emily did a great job of getting our food to us fast, and keeping tabs on us throughout the meal. Nice relaxing atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed in this place. I went on a Tuesday and my waitress was slow and dis organizationed, but that was not the reason for my bad review.  It was the food. It was just bad. We started with brushetta. Kinda tastless. Dry toast with tomatoes covered in cheese. Then dinner; I had the lasagna.  Mostly bland sauce and noodles,  some sausage and a touch of ricotta cheese, clearly a couple of days old reheated with cheap mozzarella cheese on top. Asked for bread, it was re heated to ye point it was burnt and dry. My dates food was just as bad...."}
{"text":"The food is okay but nothing to travel too far to experience.  The pizza was good."}
{"text":"This place has the best food and the worst service.  My wife and I have been here for dinner several times, entertained guests here and stopped for a couple drinks... And it's consistent--the food is fantastic and the service is awful.      One year later and not one thing has changed.  We walked in tonight to find the restaurant maybe 30% full--not real busy.  We stood at the podium and waited and waited and just about to walk out when the bartender came over and seated us.  We were told \"the server will be right with you\".   Wrong.  We waited and waited probably 15 minutes and, once again, we're ready to walk out before anyone even came to take a drink order.  We're promised some bread which took forever to arrive then we were promised some butter for the bread and that took forever.   In fairness, our server was very pleasant, just not very speedy.      And just as in my original review, our food was excellent--the ribs were some of the best I've ever had and my wife loved her pizza--but the service is terrible."}
{"text":"I really, really want to like this place.  I haven't been here in several years until about a month ago. Came with a few friends, had the prime rib special, and all was wonderful. Yay! Finally a great place in Verona!  Then I came back tonite and was reminded of the complete mediocrity that has kept me away for years.  Slow service- about 7 minutes from the time we were seated until the server showed up. (someone did bring us water in between, and no, it's not a busy evening)   Server didn't seem to really know the menu.  She was polite, but a bit clueless.  Bruschetta appetizer was nothing to be impressed by.  Ribs- meh. Nothing special at all. Simply cooked and slathered with BBQ sauce.  Shells florentine were like warm at best. Bone In ribeye absolutely not worth the $27.99 price. I think I have had better for $10 ar Country Kitchen. Zero flavor whatsoever.  And then there was the hair in my baked potato....  I will give it one more try since like I said before, I REALLY WANT to like this place. And the prime rib night was awesome. I'm hoping that's not the only good thing here."}
{"text":"Ambiance is awesome,  bartenders great (he gave me a glass of water on the first request which almost never happens), waitress was fantastic and the food...SPECTACULAR!  Salad fresh and yummy,  bread fresh and warm with soft butter, pasta cooked perfect!  We asked for a taste of the Alfredo sauce cuz sometimes it's bland when we're out but she brought it and it was great.  So we had the chicken  Alfredo and the shrimp/mushroom pasta, both very yummy!  We had so much food we took home enough to make dinner out of it the next night and that was yummy too! We luv Italian food but it's  often bland and over cooked so we rarely order it but are we glad we did here! Well done! We'll be back..."}
{"text":"Went once. It wasn't very crowded, but took a long time to get someone to take our order. When our food finally came I found my steak to be cold and mostly fat. I looked for a server for ten minutes before one came. By the time one finally graced us with her presence I was so angry that I was such to my stomach. She was not even the least dit apologetic. I paid for my wife's meal and vowed to never return. Avoid this place at all costs!"}
{"text":"Took my mom to Avanti's last Wednesday for lunch. Received a friendly greeting at the door and got seated right away. Atmosphere was pretty nice - the bar looked pretty thought out, but the dining area was plain. Not bad, but basic. Waitress was very nice and made a few jokes or two. Menu had a good variety and there was a board of specials on our way in that listed at least 4 different things they were offing that day. I got a special - 8\" pizza and salad, while my mom was set on beef filled Ravioli and ordered off the menu. Both were quite tasty and good sized. Ingredients tasted all fresh and homemade - Yum! The Ravioli came served on a bed of spaghetti - which sounded weird when the waitress told us - but didn't seem to cause any problems as my mom at every last bit of it. Good prices, good food - and very friend service.  The only complaints I had was I wasn't sure where to park - I think there was a lot in back of the building but was unclear how to get there. Also they misspelled Guinness on the drink board by the door. (really?)"}
{"text":"Super cold beer glass Basic interior Friendly service Cold- wear a sweater Family restaurant in a small town with pretty good food."}
{"text":"We decided to try Avanti's for the first time in a while tonight for the Friday night fish special.  We had heard the restaurant was under new management.  We were very satisfied with our decision.  The fish special my wife and I had were both excellent.  I had the fried cod and it was very good.  My wife had the baked cod and said it was delicious. My wife and I both liked the redesign of the interior.  We will not hesitate to dine here again.  Thank you for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Bad bad bad.. got the vegetarian was so looking forward to this. Sauce was watered down no flavor..crust tasted unbaked . Even giving this one star is one star to much"}
{"text":"This restaurant is really hit or miss. I've been there times when the food has been decent, but mist often the food and service is just so-so. The seating is a bit cramped and awkwardly arranged. Overall, it's not a bad spot, but you can't necessarily count on fantastic experience."}
{"text":"Love the new martinis! Great atmosphere in the bar area. Great bartenders. Loved the meatballs for an appetizer. Looking forward to going back again soon."}
{"text":"The place is under construction so VERY limited seating.  Was very cold inside.  Very dark lighting as most fixtures were missing.  holes in ceiling and walls torn apart.  Some guy at the bar in camouflage seated us and took waitress almost 10 minutes to greet us.  There was only one other couple in the place.  Food wasn't terrible but lacked flavor.  Decent prices but the Greek music was competing with the country radio station that was blaring in the bar area.  Was just really weird!!!!!"}
{"text":"Slow. Bad. Service.   Took forever for dinner. Was greasy and heavy. There are not many good places to eat in Verona.   Still. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Decent food and service, plenty of leftovers, be sure to have a reservation on a weekend.  O"}
{"text":"We decided to eat here after reviews on Yelp and the hotels recommendation.  Glad we did! The veal parm was excellent and the sauce good.  My friend said the eggplant parm was perfect.  Our waiter was very friendly and excellent.  This restaurant is truly a hidden gem in Verona! We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I ordered some cod meals to go.  Price was fine.  Fish were cooked well and serving size was average.   Service was quick.  Amy Kent/Jazz was playing in the background which was nice.   Tartar sauce was too small a serving for the fish.  Parking was difficult to find a close spot.   They looked pretty busy. I hoped the fish would have been better and of a larger serving.  If I go back it won't be for the fish. Let me be a little bit more explanatory.   I opted against Culver's for a fish dinner because I feel their fish is overpriced for a fast food take home meal.   So I decided to try Avanti Italian Restaurant to see if I could get a better meal.  I didn't.   Culver's is better hands down.  Thus, just because a restaurant is \"fast food\" doesn't really hold true in this scenario. I found a nice pub in Avanti to whit I would like to try again.   But for fish I would recommend Culver's.  Avanti does however have an all you can eat fish dinner for about 18 dollars.   So if you want to eat a lot of fish you can take advantage of this.   Myself, however, would maybe eat one or two more pieces which would be about 3 dollars per extra piece.   I think this is rather pricey.   All you can eat for 15 would be more appropriate I think and I will spend the extra 3 dollars on another beer anyway. I am not an restauranteur though and I could be wrong.  But I think the lower price would draw more diners over time and drive better sales and more profits. Think about it.   If someone goes to Culver's for 11 dollars and then finds they can get an all you can eat meal at Avanti for 15 it becomes a no-brainer and more people go to Avanti for fish on friday night.   But their fish has to be better than Culver's.  Which at this time it is close but not better. A few ways Avanti could improve their meal and Culver's too for that matter would be to provide a better tartar sauce in a larger quantity, larger slices of lemon, a whole grain bread rather than a bland slice of bread at Avanti and a wonder bun white from Culver's.  Avanti makes a baked potato which you cannot get at Culvers.   The baked potato is worth an extra buck to my mind.  But good fish trumps this one.  I opt for Culver's on this one."}
{"text":"Out of town customers. Loved the hometown vibe, and everyone made us feel welcome! Best bartender: Spencer! Thursday's are $5 wine night. Winning in my book!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here because we had a Bucky Book coupon and it's relatively close.   First impression was a bit rocky - we weren't exactly sure where to park. Street parking is ample and there is a small alley to a small parking lot behind the building, but we weren't sure if that was it or not at first glance. We ended up in another, bigger parking lot behind the building.  Impression was much better once we walked in. We were greeted and seated quickly. On the left side is the bar area, and on the right side is the restaurant area. Cute, comfy decor. We were immediately brought waters and I ordered a \"cherry temple\", which was cherry vodka, ginger ale, grenadine, and cherry garnish. It was a tall and was $5 - great price.  My husband ordered the chicken ranch pizza and I ordered shrimp scampi ravioli. Mine came with soup or a salad, so I ordered the cheese tortellini soup. The soup came out quickly and was good - I wasn't wowed by it, but it had good flavor.  Our entrees also came out promptly. Both my husband and I enjoyed our own meals quite a bit, and a taste-test swap proved we liked each other's, too.  Our server refilled out water glasses more than once and was overall very friendly. I think the best compliment was from my husband: \"I'd come here and pay full price!\"   High praise from that guy.   Overall, 5 stars and we will return to pay full price!"}
{"text":"We are new to Madison, living on the south west side. At the end of the day of move in we were starving and tired. We googled local take out and Avanti came up in our search. Italian food is a favorite and in the \"comfort food\" category for me, which was much needed at the time. We took a chance and ordered carry out. I had the Grilled Portobello Fettuccine and loved every bite! There was actually a large grilled portobello on top. The pasta was not over cooked and the sauce was not too rich, yet delicious. My husband had the Nona's Bolognese. He said it was good but not great. My mother tried the Veal Parmesan. She too thought her meal was good but not great, hence the three stars. All dishes were huge; enough for two for sure. We will definitely try Avanti again."}
{"text":"We've visited Avanti's many times.  We enjoy the ambiance with many different seating \"areas\" throughout the space.  Some by windows and some deeper into the space with darker lighting.  The atmosphere is casual and we have no concerns about wearing shorts and t-shirt there while dining.  All of our meals have been very good and we have enjoyed a glass of wine each time.  We have had the spaghetti and meatballs, lasagna, various appetizers, baked french onion soup and last night bluegill.  The bluegill was very good and it is something I don't see on menus often so that was a nice highlight.  Of all our visits the only feedback we have was the temperature in the space last night.  It was a warmer Wisconsin day, but not super hot.  The restaurant was very hot.  We were both sweating to discomfort.  The waitress said when they got there today they all commented that it was very hot in there.  Maybe they shut off the A/C when closed and it had not caught up yet.  We don't know.  Thus far that's our only fix-it feedback.  Great job!"}
{"text":"This was our third time at Avanti's and they NEVER disappoint! We brought other family and friends for their first time here and they all truly liked what they ordered and will return! Sandy and Vito are wonderful hosts and our waitress was very professional with a great personality. Bob S."}
{"text":"The man said that he heard of this place from a commercial on tv and after taking a look at the menu online we were both a bit eager to check it out for ourselves.  Upon walking in, you will notice that the place is a split bar and restaurant.  The bar looks like a bit of a dive and was partially filled and the restaurant was completely filed.  It was Saturday evening so this was very surprising but I guess it starts to makes more sense as the night continues.  The menu was what you would expect at a hole in the wall Italian restaurant in the Midwest (read:  spaghetti, fettuccine, and lasagna).  There weren't many authentic items on the menu but I'm not too fussy so I kept an open mind and ordered the Bolagnese over fettuccine and the man ordered the spaghetti and meat balls.  My food wasn't bad but it also tasted like food I could have made at home.  The side salad that came the meal however was great; the ranch dressing took it over the top.  Looking at my date's plate,  I noticed that it 1.) only came with two meatballs and 2.)looked exactly like mine except with spaghetti.  There is really no imagination in the preparation of the dishes.   During dinner, the bartender came and talked to us about the drinks on the menu.  He also went over which drinks were of his creation.  After talking for about 10 min or so, I could now understand why the bar had more guests than the restaurant!  The bartender is awesome and super passionate about his work there!  Unfortunately however, he is leaving to go to another bar and that was his last night.  I think I would come here again but not because the food was terrific but simply because it wasn't bad.  Also, sometimes, you just someone to cook your spaghetti for you!"}
{"text":"Man does this place have a great fish fry. I have been trying out places all over Madison to find the ultimate gem and this place has to be one of them. Definately go with the fried cod, by far the best option. Top it off with Hash Browns and a brandy old fashioned and you will have the ultimate Wisconsin Fish Fry Combo!"}
{"text":"Gross! Old! Bland in flavor. And slow in service."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a bit after a long bike in the Madison area.  Overall, a nice experience with quick and pleasant service.  I've had better Italian but this was still good.  My only issue is that there was no olive oil with the bread BUT it was nice and warm."}
{"text":"Great customer service and amazing food! We were all a little warm when we got to the restaurant and the manager turned on the AC for us until we finally cooled down. They also put a football game on we wanted to watch on the TV in front of us! Very nice staff!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great pizza - delicious crust, great balance of sauce, cheese and toppings.  We had a Sicilian and a Pepperoni and loved both.  Understand what some have said about the ambiance being more like a bar, but for a spot to grab a pizza and beer in Verona, Avanti can't be beat."}
{"text":"Great location in Verona!  The bar is beautiful and they pour a large glass of wine for a good price.  Food is marginal at best, but not consistent.  The only thing I enjoy eating is the cheese bread."}
{"text":"I was in Verona on some business and I felt like some Italian food so the hotel suggested Avantis.  I find a parking spot, (parking was a huge b*tch at that time because of the construction), and I walk down to Avantis.  I walk in, sit at the bar and give my order to a very nice gentlemen.  I ordered a seafood/white sauce meal, (don't remember the name), and a side of their signature bolognese sauce.  Both were awesome and the prices weren't too bad.  All in all, if I'm in Verona again, I will definitely be stopping by Avantis for some good Italian food."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The outside and inside is cute. We got there around 5ish on a Saturday and it wasn't very busy yet. We asked for a table by the window which there was one that had 4 chairs. She said it was 4 people and it was just 2 of us . So we got placed across from the window 10 minutes after we where seated she sat 2 people at the table that we wanted and was told no. We waited 25 minutes for 2 drinks . It looked like there was at least 2 bartenders there. I ordered eggplant and the other order was spaghetti we had to ask for Parmesan cheese. The waitress had way too much perfume on. It was overpowering. 2 tables down I heard the lady say it was 15 minutes and no drink. She ordered a martini  which was in a short glass. Food was ok. Disappointed by service. I did notice that regulars got the Royal treatment but in my opinion the everyone should get the same service. Food was ok. I don't think it should be left to the bartender to bring the drinks to the table the waitress should wait for the drinks and bring them to the table."}
