{"text":"Staying in hotel that restaurant is within.. Had dinner here 2 nights and also ordered take out at 10:45. All meals were delicious. Steak cooked properly, asparagus steamed perfect and my take out quesadilla was surprisingly yummy for a late night order .. I had low expectations. 
My server, David, took care of me both evenings and he was polite, prompt, professional and made my solo dining experiences pleasant. Hostesses were nice and manager also stopped by to see how my meal was. 
Overall, a great dining experience. Give this restaurant a chance."}
{"text":"I was here for for dinner on a business trip. They ate very proud of there steaks as they should be. I had the filet. It came out on a huge plate by itself and my sides came out on another plate. Seemed a bit weird to me. The steak was cooked to my liking with good flavor. Not the best steak I ever had so not sure why priced so high. I would recommend another place I think this location being at a hotel has a captive customer bace and quality may be subpar to other Omaha steak houses."}
{"text":"Nice if you're staying at the hotel and want a quick, tasty bite to eat.  Nice, quiet atmosphere.  However, there are better options in the area if you have the time to find something."}
{"text":"I ordered a rib eye, and the steak wasn't very flavorful at all. Plain, with almost no seasoning, riddled with gristle, and tough. Mashed potatoes had the consistency of paste and were cold. Not what I'd expect for a 32$ steak."}
{"text":"The ABSOLUTE  worst service I've ever experienced. Ignored when showed up for our reservation, finally the hostess took us to our booth which we had to wait for her to clean first. After about 5min a waiter showed up to take our drink order. We saw him again in 5 more minutes without any drinks but asking if we wanted bread. 5 more minutes he came with bread and asked if we wanted ranch to dip it in since they just ran out of butter. He was joined by our true waiter at this time so he backed off. Our REAL waiter asked if he could take our order, sure you can but first can you bring us some butter? Sure I will check he says but what would you l Iike to order? We would l like 2 10 ounce filets with mashed potatoes and a side order of fries. One medium well and could you describe your medium rare and medium as my wife ask everytime she orders steaks. His reply was he isn't good at description so he stood with a pregnant pause! We ordered medium rare and said if to rare we get fired back up a little. He left to place order and a different waiter came with our 2 beers which have been sitting out for 20 minutes somewhere cause they were room temperature.  Did I mention this was Valentines Day! How is this place still in business? ? Will never visit a Ohama Steak again!!"}
{"text":"I was really surprised to see this at the side of a hotel.  Gave it a try.  The bartender was really friendly and great service.  Great steak!  I asked for medium, and it was perfect!   The steak comes with a potato or other side.  If you want some veggies, you would have to order that a la cart."}
{"text":"I'm really confused by this place.   The food was great,  but the service was horrible!   We ordered sandwiches because they told us they were out of all potatoes.  Then the table next to us gets potatoes.   It took over an hour of waiting to get our food.  That was after waiting 7 minutes to get the server to even acknowledge our presence. Then a crazy amount of time to get our credit card back.   Great food,  but be prepared to wait FOREVER."}
{"text":"My family and I have always had a great meal here. I personally am a big fan of the New York Strip."}
{"text":"We were staying at the hotel and went there.  Big mistake. Our food server quit during his shift.  Waited about  an hour for our food, which was cold. Asked to talk to the manager and was told he was not available.  Not inly will I never go back I will never mail order their products.  Worst place to eat ever."}
{"text":"we had amazing food at the restaurant and we would like to give KUDOs to the team.
Everything was amazing and high quality.

I would like to recommend the place"}
{"text":"Went Last night to Omaha, was seated right away. We had to wait a long time for food our food was mistakenly taken to another table.

Had the Ribeye with the Yukon Mashed potatoes. Husband steak was cooked perfectly, wife steak was cooked under and had to be re-cooked. Steak came back and was to over. Managers responded promptly and a new steak was cooked and was perfect.

Waiters and Mangers very Responsive. 

We have been a couple of times, and will def be back."}
{"text":"Don't do it! The food took forever and when my husband's steak finally came (which he had ordered medium rare) it was well-done. They sent it back and the replacement was tar-tar, absolutely raw inside. The atmosphere was lackluster and the entire experience was bad."}
{"text":"Very good food. Had the filet mignon with a side order of mushrooms, which I totally recommend. Started the meal with shrimp cocktail and wedge salad. Both were very very fresh and really hit the spot for starters.
If you're staying at the hotel I would highly recommend the meal we had.
Ask for Brent,he was an excellent waiter as well."}
{"text":"I'd give it 3.5 stars.  If you go in with low to moderate expectations it's surprisingly good.  I ordered a fillet mignon medium and it came back well done but I didn't complain because it still looked really good, I was starving and the first bite was tasty.  Next time if it's not cooked right I'll probably say something since steak houses in general are pricey and you should get what you pay for.  The vinaigrette on my fresh greens salad was delicious.  And my baked potato was a little over done as well but all in all it was a great experience.

The dining room is definitely not flashy.  Don't wear shorts but also don't worry about getting too dressed up.  It's a casual environment with a fairly extensive wine and liquor selection and very friendly service.  You can be pretty comfortable going with a large group and even bringing kids. Maybe it's because they're attached to the Embassy Suites that the atmosphere is so casual.  From the restaurant entrance you can see the hotel jacuzzi and since they had the door propped open there was a strong chlorine tainted breeze which was a bit weird.

The best part was the Obscenely Chocolate Cake for dessert which is layers of chocolate cake and fudge.  And it was also great taking home a bottle of their steak seasoning which I haven't been able to find in grocery stores around town.  Their steak rub makes any store bought steak taste gourmet and turns a ho hum steak into a really nice evening cooking at home, which is why we went to try their restaurant to begin with.  

All in all, it's good, quality food, just not a sexy date spot..."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good steak, prime ribeye, cant be beat.  Not what ww were expecting in a layover in Charlotte, but a very nice surprise, and great steak!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations of this place, because Omaha Steaks are shipped around the world. However, the quality of the fillet mignon ($32) didn't meet my expectations. The steak was only okay, and a bit dry. They skimped on the mashed potatoes for me as well.. got like half a cup's worth, which was less than the 12oz steak.

The guy sitting to my left ordered medium, and he got a rare.

The waiter will ask you if you want sides, but doesn't tell you that it's an additional $7.

The Omaha chopped salad sucked. I would give it a 2/5. Mostly iceberg lettuce, not much of anything else that was supposed to be there (ham, cheese, eggs, olives). Think of a chef's salad, but worse. You can get a better pre-prepared salad at a grocery store."}
{"text":"Rybeyesteak was perfectly cooked.  Mashed potatoes got a little too much butter but it was good.  Calamari was greasy and it tasted like Chinese food.  Nasty. Crab cakes were good as well.  But most of all... Steak was heavenly. 

Total came out 83 for two steaks and a appetizer.  I would not mind paying 65 max.  We may be back in 6 months to a year.   

If you are craving for a good cut of meat and some mash potatoes go here otherwise I won't not recommend for anything else.   

Do not need to make reservations cuz every time I come here it is always empty.   Takes awhile to get the food tho.  I never understand why.  We are waiting for a waiter to order deserts and it has been 15 min. No hope over here.  I can hear him talking to some people in the bar. Good luck to you!"}
{"text":"It's restaurant week and I wanted to try something new... So I took my mom to dinner here and first off this place is less classy then Olive Garden... I was thinking upscale... Boy was I wrong... I could have gone to Friday's... Anyway we get there and our waiter seems out of the loop... We ordered our food and drinks... Everything seemed fine... But we waited 45mins to get our food... The place was empty so I'm confused about that... The potatoes were cold and u can tell they are box made... The steak was good but it was no flavor and more fat then steak... The only thing good was the Cesar salad but that cause I love garlic, if I didn't I would have hated it... Ugh never ever coming here again... Disappointed!! And I'm not getting there steaks to my house either!"}
{"text":"This is the first time that I have eaten in an Omaha Steak House. In the past, I usually order online and have all their products shipped. So this is a very enjoyable experience.

This Omaha Steak House is located on the ground floor of Embassy Suites and right next to their dining area. 

No need for reservations. The place was practically empty on a rainy Saturday night. They sat us in a booth. Atmosphere is dark and oak like typical of a steak house decor. 

What made the evening so memorable was our waiter. He had a great sense of humor and was so entertaining.

The Crispy Calamari with the spicy sweet duck sauce was really good. Also liked the Steak house Wedge, the wedge was crispy and fresh.

As for entrees- The 7 ounce Filet Mignon cooked perfectly to my specification of Medium well as well as the 10 ounce Filet Mignon cooked medium rare too. The side order of Grilled Asparagus drizzled with balsamic vinegar was perfect.

We did not order dessert for we were so stuffed.

Will definitely, be back again. Great service, friendly staff, and great food. I am an Omaha fan and have ordered via their website for holiday gifts, presents, birthday's, etc... But it is definitely a nice treat to try out their restaurants."}
{"text":"Great service. I sat and ate dinner at the bar. I think my bartenders name was Jason. He recommended some good food and appetizers. Good conversation. Nice and quiet place to
grab a bite. Big portions just on small plates.. A little pricey too but it was pretty good so I plan on going back.."}
{"text":"I really didn't have much of an option as far as dining went when I was stranded in Charlotte, NC and staying at the Embassy Suites. I wasn't familiar with Charlotte and I really didn't want to pay for a cab while looking for a restaurant where I'd be dining alone. I could have ordered room service but half the menu was from the Omaha Steak House anyway, I figured I'd just go downstairs to eat and save myself the room service charge.

The service was really friendly. My server was especially sweet and attentive. However, I didn't really think much of the food item she recommended.They had freshly baked bread which was nice. It was piping hot but slightly undercooked and still very doughy in the middle. I got myself quite a surprise when I bit into it.  I didn't think that part was so nice. My Jumbo Shrimp cocktail was OK... nothing to write home about although I did like the cocktail sauce. It had tons of horseradish in it just the way I like it. I had the Steak and Avocado Salad with Lime Cilantro Dressing which the waitress told me was one of their bestselling items on the menu. It's probably my fault for not ordering a steak at a steakhouse but it did have some steak in it. I was envisioning a tangy crisp salad with creamy avocado pieces and thick, warm slices of medium rare steak draped on top. However, what I got was a limp lettuce salad with cold steak chopped into tiny pieces with congealed fat sticking to it. The lime cilantro dressing tasted exactly like its name. It had chopped cilantro and lime juice.. no other seasonings.. So gross. 

Great service, not so great food. If you're staying at the Embassy Suites in Charlotte, NC try looking someplace else to eat than the Omaha Steakhouse downstairs."}
{"text":"The number of steak houses in Charlotte isn't exactly overwhelming.  Until a few years ago, if someone asked me where to go, I probably would have sent them to the Hereford Barn.  But since they closed, there weren't really a lot of options.

Recently even the chain places have begun closing, which isn't really a huge loss, but it does leave a certain opening for a good place to find a steak.  About the only option are the \"old time\" steak houses, such as Beef and Bottle and The Ranch House - and neither are that great.

Perhaps it is because of all this that I don't often look for steak in Charlotte.  It's just not a steak sort of town.  But one night while partaking in the manager's reception at the Embassy Suites, we weren't sure where to go, and decided that we'd try the Omaha Steak House, simply because it was raining and we were a bit pressed for time.  It was one of the best decisions we had made in a very long time.

The only downside is that if you have a drink from the Embassy Suites, you can't take it inside because of separate liquor licenses.  That's not a huge problem, but it would be nice if you could do so.

After overcoming any complaints on that front, we settled into our seat and had to decide what we'd have for dinner.  Like many steak restaurants, the selection isn't huge, and that's not an entirely bad thing.

To give the menu a good test drive, we settled on an appetizer of the crispy bleu cheese chips and the onion cheese soup.  For the main course, I had a small fillet mignon and my wife had a sirloin.

The chips were tasty, though the bleu cheese was perhaps a bit much.  It might have been better without the cheese, or if the cheese was spread a bit more evenly - or even offered on the side.  I think the chips stood well on their own.

I also found that the soup, as with most French onion-style soups, was a bit challenging.  The flavor was good, but the cheese crust on the top was just too heavy.  That's not so much a knock against the restaurant as it is against the style of soup.

We also had some of their bread, which was garlic-infused or something, and it was awesome (though I can't imagine it was particularly low-calorie).

Before long, the steaks arrived.  I took mine with the mashed potatoes, while my wife opted for the baked potato.  While the menu says you get mashed potatoes, you can in fact swap that out for about anything.  Other sides are also available for an additional charge.

The fillet was, put simply, excellent.  It was the best I'd had in some time.  The sirloin was good too, but the fillet was better, and worth the extra money.  Apparently grilled with butter and the Omaha Steak seasoning, it was done just right.

While we had no problem with service, we did notice a group of three people come in, and apparently unhappy with not being served quickly enough, get up and leave.  So your own experience may be hit and miss.  We might have to check it out again to see."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place was the service. Our server was phenomenal. Wish I would remember his name. We had a party of 8 and it was late at night, but he still worked hard to make sure we we were happy. Unfortunately my food was not happy. I had the steak salad and it was severely lacking. The meat was tough and unseasoned. The lettuce was skimpy. I just can't give a steak restaurant more stars when a simple steak salad was so bad, no matter how good the service is."}
{"text":"Ordered filet medium rare arrived medium well.  Remade but took forever.  Hubby done with his dinner, wine bottle finished.  Left to eat alone, they could have at least offered a free glass of wine.  Also, costly, everything a LA carte."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night and it wasn't crowded.  Service was great and food was too.  I had the large filet medium rare and it was perfect and flavorful. The mashed potatoes were excellent as was the field greens salad, which has red onions and diced tomatoes and cucumbers.   Loved their bread, which has olive oil and onion to dip into."}
{"text":"Unfortunately will never come back. We did not have a reservation therefore we were seated in the lounge area, which was fine, beverages and salads came to our table in a timely manner. Our meals did not! An hour later still nothing. People that were seated after us had got there food. When we finally got out food it wasn't worth the wait. The manager did apologize and gave us a discount."}
{"text":"How does an Omaha Steakhouse run out of baked potatoes??!! I was pissed! I ordered the steak and avocado salad MINUS the red onions. After waiting quite a while for it to come out, guess what? RED ONIONS!! I had to send it back and wait again. Everything is a la carte, so bring extra money!"}
