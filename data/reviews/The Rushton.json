{"text":"I enjoyed a warm mushroom salad for lunch on their patio.  The atmosphere on the inside was inviting and the staff was warm and courteous.  The only drawback was that it was pricey."}
{"text":"Veggie burger was one of the best i've had and the drink list is extensive.  LOVE the laid back atmosphere and the service was great and friendly too.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious varied menu, pretty good service,  busy patio...a nice girlfriends or date night out."}
{"text":"This place is always busy!  Even though it was a bit chilly last night, the patio at The Rushton was heated and toasty.  I called ahead to see if I would need reservations and they said that they don't take reservations for parties under 6 people, but seeing as I was coming around 8:15 pm on a Wednesday, there would be no problem getting a table.  Wrong!    My pal and I sat on the outdoor patio couch on the sidewalk and waited until 8:30 pm for any table that opened, inside or outside.  You can order drinks to that couch, so that was cool.  The hostess was very nice and said that a table opened up on the patio, which was fine because they had the heating turned on.  Our waiter came out immediately after we were seated.  They delivered fresh bread and a spread that changes all the time.  Last night's was a bean and goat cheese spread that was light and tasty on the yummy, chewy bread.  The menu isn't large, but has great variety.  I ordered the veggie burger with sweet potato fries.  The consistency of the burger is a bit mushy, but I find it so tasty that I didn't mind having to eat if with a fork and knife.  Like the pickle on the side!  Their dessert menu is great, though I was so stuffed, I decided to stick with a tea.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  I look forward to eating there again!  The neighbourhood is in the midst of ongoing gentrification, so on one side of the restaurant is a coin laundry and across the other side is a closed down store front.  Across the street are boutiques and The Goodwill is just east on St. Clair."}
{"text":"I've passed The Rushton several times, and so my gf and I decided to finally check it out for dinner on Wednesday. The server greeted us on the patio, and was very responsive throughout  our entire meal.  We opted for a couple of glasses of wine while we checked out the menu's offerings, which included everything from Duck Confit to pasta to Veggie Burgers. I had the Salmon with Orzo, while my gf went with the Roasted Chicken. The meal was served in a timely manner, and everything was excellent!  The salmon was outstanding, and I especially loved the Orzo and the creamy green salsa!  Only negative comment about the meal was regarding the bread and hummus-type topping they served prior to dinner. The topping was tasty, but, they could have gone with more pieces, and a better type of bread (too dry/crusty!). Despite this minor detail, it was a good experience, and we'll definitely be back! The Rushton's a great place for couples, or a group of people, and I recommend checking it out if you want a bite to eat or a drink on a patio. (For a quieter setting, try the patio on a warm day/night, or if you're seeking a little more of a lively vibe, the inside dining room seemed to be a happening spot.)"}
{"text":"Food was a welcome change up to the usual St.Clair grub.  Portions are quit large, if not a bit intimidating.  Wife had a veal chop that was gluten free and was a touch over cooked(med rare was ordered medium-well was delivered). My steak frites was very tasty, however I would prefer a more peppery peppercorn sauce. The frites were good but those too were overcooked for my liking."}
{"text":"Good neighborhood restaurant.  Good service.  Food is consistently good: I especially love the Rack of Lamb and the Poutine (for the Americans, a poutine is a dish of fries topped with cheese curds, bacon and gravy - yum!).  The ambience is casual, loud and comfortable.  No reservations taken and the wait could get stupid.  Nice patio for the summer."}
{"text":"The place is over-priced and it took almost 45 minutes to get our food. The service was ok but I still don't recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of the Rushton; the patio is great for summer dinner dates. I find there menu always has something for any type of occasion (casual/romantic) and I absolutely love dining here!"}
{"text":"We had the best lunch recently.  We shared a sea bass and a Rushton salad.  The sea bass was incredibly delicious."}
{"text":"This a great date place. The food is upscale. The drinks are a bit pricey but it comes with the environment. The atmosphere is dressy casual and the dim lights help with the romantic feel. The presentation is wonderful as they take the time to show that they care about their food and business. Give this place a try especially if you're trying to impress."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has such a low rating! Also: it is definitely NOT spendy. The entrees run at about $18. Add in a glass of wine, and you are still under $31... definitely not spendy.  It's a good place for a night out, for sure, maybe not a place to go every week, but it's still great. Beautiful decor and ambiance makes it possible to be either casual or dressy, and not feel out of place. Unfortunately it is packed a little tightly inside, so getting to the bathroom can be difficult if the bar is full. But there are always a ton of staff around (despite being a smallish restaurant, they still have a hostess out front every night) to help things run smoothly.  The food is delicious, and a lot of the dishes come in two sizes, which is great when I go with my parents, who never want a full meal.   It's especially wonderful in the summertime when the lovely and large patio is open - they also open the front windows, which is always wonderful."}
{"text":"Decided to try out this restaurant on a Wednesday night.  Was surprised at how busy it was, but it is not a large restaurant and we didn't arrive until after 8pm.  Service was a bit slow, but nothing to complain about.  I had the fish fry (basically fish & chips) which came with sweet potato fries.  The fish itself was quite bland, but the sweet potato fries were great.  My friends both had the mussels & fries and said they were pretty good.  Overall, I would def come back again, but would order something else off the menu.  And looks like they have a great patio for the summer...."}
{"text":"Pros:  Nice Atmosphere  |  Good Selection Of Drinks  |  Good Menu  |  Good Service Cons:  Kitchen Staff  |  Food  I have been to the Rushton a few times but I can only remember the last two; the most recent being June 26, 2011.  The 2nd last time I had the burger as a main and there was nothing to complain about.  We sat inside and I enjoyed the fact that the artwork on the walls is available for purchase.  This is something I would like to see in many more restaurants...a great way to support the arts community!  This time we sat out on the patio which has a nice atmosphere and is not overly crowded.  The chair was very uneven but I was not going to let it annoy me.  They have one long continuous heater (more effective than spot heat lamps) which allows them to open the patio earlier in the season and close it later...of course it was not on at the time.  I vaguely remember being there to experience the less effective heat lamps.    Around the time we placed our order I overheard one server say to another, (roughly) what is going on tonight?  This was said as she took back a plate of food.  I ordered the Lobster Linguine without mushrooms while my partner ordered the Steak Frites (6oz) done medium-rare.  I enjoyed the taste of the linguine but was highly annoyed at having to surgically remove every last piece of mushroom before beginning to eat.  I am usually hesitant to send something back to the kitchen and did not want to wait, then eat by myself.  Halfway through my partner complained that his meal was not very good at all.  The steak was well done and looked thin and dry.  We both could have sent our meals back but it was too late at that point.    Overall, the atmosphere is nice and the food is decent enough but it is not worth the money you are paying here.  At the end the server noticed the kitchen had not followed their directions regarding the mushrooms at which point my partner mentioned the problem with the steak.  It is possible the server was saving face but we gave him the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"I came by late on a Thursday night with some friends and the place was packed.  We only waited a few minutes for our table and the food was terrific.  I had the steak and sweet potato fries and a very yummy creme brule.  The wine was tasty too.  My only complaint is that it is a touch squishy inside when full."}
{"text":"Food was great. Went midday on a Thursday. Calamari was tender, the steak was exceptionally tender and very delicious. Decor is nice, elegant and modern. Service was attentive and quick.  Not able to go to the neighborhood as much as I used to but love going to the Rushton when I can."}
{"text":"I've been to the Rushton a number of times and consistently find the food pretty mediocre. The three small sliders are good, but the fish fry is super greasy as are the crab cakes. Bordering on inedible, greasy.  Spinach salad is good, but lacks consistency and under-dressed with too much wilted, half-rotten leaves mixed in. Last time we went for dinner THREE times people tried to take my plate - while I was still eating!! Once I was actually lifting food to my mouth when an over-anxious busboy tried to grab the plate.  Seriously?  I know it's a small room, and we've been sitting for approximately 30 minutes, but can I finish chewing before you whisk my dish away?  The third time I stopped mid-fork-raising and said \"I'M STILL EATING!\"  The servers range from warm & friendly to distracted and vaguely disinterested; recently for lunch the waiter was very busy behind the bar having conversations, but took 10 minutes to bring a single glass of wine, had to be prompted to bring pepper and not once in our 2-hour lunch (he was that slow) did he ever ask how the food was.  All that aside, it's a great room - we love the ambiance and the patio (where you'll for sure be ignored if you're not 25 and scantily clad!).  I can't believe the high ratings it receives for food, however.  People of Hillcrest need to get out more. A nice room and square dishes do not good flavours make!"}
{"text":"We ordered a burger and we were disappointed because the burger was extremely burnt. Great ambiance though. Would just come back for drinks."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend the poutine.  It's fancy (for poutine), but hawt-damn is it ever tasty.  \"pomme frites with shredded duck confit, creamy wild mushrooms, melted cheese and caramelized shallot jus\""}
{"text":"The sliders, yup very good turkey sliders.  Lots of good food to choose from.  The clubhouse is pretty tasty as well.   Simple foods but they do it all well.  Great service and atmosphere.  Patio is amazing in the warmer months.  Highly recommend if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Came here yesterday at 12:30 pm for my birthday lunch and the ambience was so nice with the lights inside and the vibrant South American music playing. No distracting loud shouting from any guests which can sometimes happen on a Saturday we all had Americanos and one early grey tea. Very good. And brother had the two fish tacos which he said were very filling after clearing the plate. Dad has the chicken clubhouse which comes on the baguette bread and the fries he said were the best he's had. The waitress also said that the clubhouse was top three seller. And I had the special omelette of the day with half sweet potato fries and garden salad. I was full after only half the meal. So good ! Waitress was very friendly. We never felt rushed   Great window seats and overall amazing food that will bring us back as regulars."}
{"text":"For a change, I ventured outside of the Queen Street Corridor  (East and West) to go up North. After a brisk walk from the St Clair W subway station (things seem further apart up here) we arrived into a warm and exocticly decorated interior. This restaurant is smaller than I expected, but since they don't take reservations, by arriving before 7:30, we beat the crowds.  We picked some drinks off the extensive cocktail list, but only after 10 minutes when the waiter came by the explain the specials and ask if we were ready to order.... I was parched and just wanted water.  After finally getting some water and the Tom (tom collins, but with lots of pulpy lime juice!) I was ready to order. The salads and appetizers, which are listed as 'small plates' on the menu are pretty darn big. I'm not used to these quantities in the downtown restaurants.  The Stinky salad could have used more stinky cheese, but the tempura vegetables were delicious with the spicy mayo dip. The special appetizer was big enough to be my main dish.  All of the mains at the table were quite good, including the steak, frites."}
{"text":"Today was our second time dining at The Rushton and let me say, it was quite a nice time! We sat on their patio (as we did last time a few weeks ago) in a nice shady spot near the kitchen.  Perhaps sitting closer to the sun could have been nice.  Anyhow, we ordered a few beers and the fried calamari to start. The calamari was nothing special, but was consistent with the previous time we had ordered it. It definitely tasted like calamari!  I decided to get the \"Veggie Burger\" for my main dish and, let me tell you, it was very impressive a dish! It tasted like yams though the menu said it was made out of green lentils and black beans, but I truly did not care about this inconsistency because it was so darn great. Somehow, my goat cheese was forgotten but the waiter quickly corrected this mistake. 9/10 for being so attentive!  About halfway through our delicious entrees we noticed a woman and her friend come out to the patio. She had crutches, which I thought was interesting.  My date ordered the \"Spinach Salad\" which came with garden fresh beets, spinach, and a few other healthy things including our beloved goat cheese. He thought it was good, but was rather disappointed to find out that a dish advertised as a \"quinoa salad\" was only lightly sprinkled with quinoa... A bit chincy if you ask me. Despite this downfall, he did rave about those garden fresh beets which came in a red and yellow variety.  We noticed one of the waitresses had a tag sticking out of her shirt. 6/10 for appearing presentable at all times.  When I went to use the facilities at the end of our meal, the young fellow behind the bar gave me the biggest smile I think I've ever received in my life. Thank you for brightening my day!  For a place called the Rushton, we didn't feel very \"rushed\"! We believe the woman on crutches appreciates this, too. Get well soon."}
{"text":"I just returned to The Rushton after not having been there for awhile, and I was somewhat horrified that what I thought was their signature dish was GONE.  The original poutine was GONE.  It used to be fries with a triple-crème brie and pulled braised lamb ...and now was changed to a duck confit.  The poutine was still fine...fries were nice, but not as interesting as with the lamb.    Sigh...Progress?  Anyways...the resto is still fun.  The service was very friendly and attentive, and the patio wide and reasonably covered from the downpour that we experienced while on the patio.  Their drink list is fun with a small but reasonably varied tap selection.  They have a reasonable selection of wines by the glass.  Their Mac and Cheese offered as a side dish, is a healthier, richer alternative to the usual slop offered on a kids menu at a restaurant, and readily met approval by my 2 youngsters...which were easily accomodated by going for an early sitting rather than a standard, PACKED evening dining clot.  Portions were a decent size...chicken was moist, and well cooked, burger was tasty and a good size, and other dishes were well prepared and presented.  This is a hip and happenin' place, and regularly gets packed in the evening by regular locals.  So, expect good energy, and a bit of congestion after 7pm...but before that, you're probably alright with kids."}
{"text":"Amazing, tender steak frites and garlic mashed potatoes. The roasted garlic aioli is also to die for!!"}
{"text":"Just recently organized a baby shower in Feb. 2013. The food was amazing!! The staff were wonderful. Frank the owner nicest, patient,  person to deal with while trying to organize.  All our guest complimented us!!! Thank you again Frank n staff!!! Angela H"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. But every single time I have gone, I have gotton sick and so have the people I came with. They use something in their seafood dish for 2, I can't figure out what it is, MSG maybe? But the next day and this happened on two visits, I have a violent severe allergic reaction. Last time, my friend had their vegetable dishes and she went home and was violently ill as well. It's too bad as their dishes are excellent, but I always feel like crap afterwards. Service is questionable too. The servers are always making fun of the customers, in a mean spirited way."}
{"text":"I went in with a friend for a drink, no food (we had just had roti at Alberts down the road..yummy!)   The decor is great - modern, masculine and feminine at the same time.   I had the l'orange martini (orange vodka and pineapple juice were some of the ingredients in this amazing drink) and my friend had the tom (gin, lime). The drinks were so good, we did a wow when we each sipped ours then traded to share the experience!   At $7-12 a pop, we each only had one drink (I like the Souz Dal $3 drinks on Wed for cost effectiveness!!!) But, I would like to go back and try the food (it looked great coming out of the kitchen) and another one of their other speciality drinks. Their drink menu is extensive. Huge wine menu. They must have a very large wine cellar in the basement.   I feel there are way too many tables in the place. You had to plan your route to get in and out and our waiter had a hard time reaching us. Yes the place is great and cozy, but could use less tables."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I try to get out for a \"nice\" dinner about once a month, and had yet to try this joint. It's a stones throw from our home and looks fabulous from the outside. It didn't disappoint.  We snagged the very last open two-top at about 9 PM on a Tuesday night (but there were a few large groups having parties that might have made it tougher than usual) with no waiting and pretty quickly fell in love with the decor. Rough brick walls toss the low light around in pretty ways and there are some decent Burtynsky imitations on the walls (which I mean in the most affectionate way possible.)  Both veterans of the service industry, we noted that our server took a bit to come and get our drink order, but he was positively slammed and from the moment we were sort of \"officially\" under his care, service was shockingly consistent, fast, professional, and kind for the amount of pressure they were under.  The menu suffers from having almost too MANY things we wanted to try, furthering the dilemma were a number of delicious sounding specials. My boyfriend had a perfect piece of salmon, while I opted to go with the slightly less expensive 8 oz. steak and frites (half potato, half yam, nice touch) that were cooked to perfection (a perfect rare) so that I could have a ricotta/butternut squash/walnut/brown butter ravioli appetizer special that was legitimately special.  I have to reiterate that the speed and perfection at which things came out of the little kitchen was really admirable. Everything came out at that perfect 10-20-10 ratio and was piping hot.  We had decided before we left we'd become monthly regulars."}
{"text":"Very overpriced and the food was okay... for the price you are paying, you might as well go to The Catch next door which I assume it's a somehow related to Rushton. Ordered the steak frites and duck confit. The duck was a little too salty, steak was decent. Service was slow and i got bitten by mosquitoes 3 times!!!"}
{"text":"This week was my first real time in Toronto to walk the streets, see the sights and most of all enjoy great food!   I take my Yelp reviews quite seriously and this one is no exception.  My very good friend graciously hosted me and after deciding whether to go downtown or stay in St. Claire I encouraged her to keep it local.  That was such a great idea...because we ended up at one of her local favorite restaurants, The Rushton.  The interior was rustically warm with exposed brick, tin ceilings, rich dark wood tables and even charming chandeliers hanging in the dining room.  The staff greeted us with smiles and ushered us to a table straight away.  Our server was Simon...great smile, quick to make recommendations for drinks and give us the daily specials before we took in the menu.  Ample time was given between bringing our cocktails, so we could think about the specials and make the all important decision for our dinner choices.   The veal chop special with pumpkin puree and swiss chard was chosen by my friend, and for me the grilled Atlantic salmon with roasted red pepper rouille and creamy green salsa served over jasmine basmati rice  and sautéed spinach.  We were served a duo of breads with a red pepper hummus spread before the mains arrived.   The runner arrived with two warm plates with beautifully presented meals.  The quality of the food was perfect.  Even though stuffed with the generous portions I could have gone for seconds....because it was just that good.  I would love to have a restaurant like this, or the myriad of choices the St. Claire area has to offer, in my own neighborhood, but for now I'll settle for another visit soon and settle in to try another choice of the Rushton's great menu."}
{"text":"Love this place! excellent steak and frites, very good menu , excellent wine menu as well, when I was single many years ago it was my go to Date place, now I still frequent it..."}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Food is always good and drinks are also really nice. My favourite time to come is during lunch. So relaxed but still classy. Thanks rushton for being a place i can take my mom, and a place i can go for dinner and drinks with friends!"}
{"text":"The vibe and atmosphere was good. Service was friendly.   The food... not so much.  Some things are good, and some things are a total miss.  I had their fish fry... and was disappointed. The halibut / batter they used was under seasoned.  If not for the Tartar sauce, i would have been tempted to send the fish back in order to express my displeasure.  Dessert was ok. Don't order the apple pie... the crust is tough and difficult to cut through.  Attention to details by the chefs could have made my dining experience different."}
{"text":"I dine in there on Good Friday. My order was steak and fries. To be honest, the quality of steak does not match its price and overcooked as the steak is no longer juicy.  Disappointed with the service I received during a not busy time. The waitress seems really want me to finish my dishes. I've been asked to take away the food every once I stopped chewing. Don't know if it's because I was there myself.  Interestingly, I was treated differently with the clients on other tables. The 'helpful' waitress was trying to teach me how to use my bank card on a debit-only pos machine. It makes wonder that the quality of server training at this restaurant.  I am pretty sure the pricing of your food can afford you finding some decent staff."}
{"text":"Grilled calamari was disgusting and I found foil in my food I got the fried calamari after nothing special it seems as though the chef is a student for the plates I seen coming from the kitchen. Servers weren't in any rush to attend to guests I give this place a 1 star"}
{"text":"we live just up the road from the rushton restaurant and ate there countless times.  the food is straight forward, delicious and never dissapointed us. the price is reasonable, you can get a great dinner for 2 in about $60 (no alcohol)."}
{"text":"I went there for my birthday last night and service was incredible from start to finish. They went totally out of their way to make sure I felt special and looked after from a free drink to a dessert. I had the duck confit. Presentation was lovely and it tasted great. It was a little sweet for my liking, but that's just my personal preference. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was ok... I got the veg sandwich which seemed fine but the salad looked like it was straight out of a 'mixed greens' bag at the grocery store and the dressing was odd, I had a few bites and left it. I ate the entire sandwich but now it's been a few hours and I'm not feeling very well at all. All signs point to this place :("}
{"text":"Went here for drinks and dinner.  The drink at the bar prior to the meal was quite week yet expensive, but atmosphere was very nice.   For dinner I had the soup special- butternut squash soup which is slightly out of season for late summer and it tasted as such- was slightly below par- lacked the thickness I am accustomed too..  Plus the soup was presented in a huge bowl...like10inches high...for small tables, not a good idea.  The drink I got at table was much better.  The rib eye steak was very good.     The dessert wine... 21$ port wine was great but the glass was barely filled.  At least come close to a third of the glass for that price...and because of that they lost a star.   The ambience was delightful.  Outside seating was very nice, until the trash truck came by, and an awful stench followed.... Luckily I was paying the bill at the time, but felt sorry for the other diners just receiving their food.  Would I return? Probably would check out other places in the area first, but it was good enough for a return visit.  They accept Amx.  MSZ"}
{"text":"I have been to the Rushton a few times'; Its a busy place on St. Clair, and has a nice bar, if you want to have a drink before dinner.   Never been dissapointed in a meal here.  The Bartender whipped up my favorite Sour Apple Martini last time I was in, and it was off the menu, so I did appreciate that. Nice ambiance, and it is a bit tight space wise, but they do aim to please. Steak Frites is #1 on my list of faves, but of course that;s a personal bias to begin with. Give it a try, and do enjoy. No reservations, so it's first come, first serve, you know the drill.... Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The Rushton has a menu that everybody needs in their neighborhood. It's one of those restaurants where I would be happy with any option on the menu. However, my stomach isn't big enough, so I settled for a few and all of the dishes were good.  We were treated great from the moment we walked in. Our waitress gave us a choice of tables, took my coat, and made us feel at home. I already mentioned I could eat anything on the dining menu, but have not yet mentioned the drinks menu. Gotta love a place that has a drinks menu, and this one is extensive. Really. I appreciate a place that lists their beers on tap, so I don't have to ask, or worse, peer at the bar to try to read the names of the beers on the tap. And the beers on tap were a good selection of imports and local craft beers.  We had the special oysters to start (half a dozen on the half shell - big, juicy and flavorful),  the lobster linguin in pesto sauce and the steak frites. The frites were a delicious mix of regular and sweet potato. Yum.   As I said, our server was great, the food and drink were great. After I return and try more on the delightful menu, I am sure I will upgrade to 5 stars. I really wish this place was in my neighborhood. I would go pretty often."}
{"text":"For anyone in the neighbourhood the Rushton is an regular dinner spot.  And we are lucky for it, as you can count on them.  The food is good, it is always packed, has a nice enough patio and it works well for varied tastes - something for everyone.  I guess part of the 3 star rating is that I do not think the service is great - they are a bit lazy because they are always busy.  I also hate that they won't take reservations.  Would like it much better if they could get brunch right - as there is a shortage of good brunch spots.  Deffinitely go and check it out."}
{"text":"nice bar, nice staff, lackluster veggie burger."}
{"text":"It's a great cozy place, amazing location, AWESOME staff but it's too pricy....  MASSIVE tequila shots. Biggest shots i have ever seen in my life. You could probably use that shot glass as a tiny vase :S.  We had the sangria, white wine. Highly highly recommended - it was friggin delicious!!!!! The calamari we had were in some kind of sweet and spicy chili sauce, i didn't like the sauce at all. It made the calamari soggy and it was so overpowering. Should have just gotten the regular deep fried ones :(.  I wouldn't come here again unless it was the only place close enough to the salsa stage and it was raining."}
{"text":"I became aware of it through the Now's Patio guide. I'm glad I went. It's far from the trendy places in downtown, and personally, I appreciate that. The decor and layout is very beautiful and modern. I took a quick peek inside and there is exposed brick which I absolutely adore. I arrived a little bit after 6pm on a Friday and there were several patio tables available for my choosing.  The menu is mostly seafood, so caution for those who are not keen on seafood fare.  But both my dish and my friend's dish were good and a good serving sized portion. I ordered the fish fry and it was not greasy - high marks! We ordered dessert too and to my delight, the creme brulee was large and with a good texture and flavour. However, I didn't finish it b/c I was full. She ordered the cheesecake and it's a small portion. I may try it next time. We stayed there for close to 3 hours and were served with a smile and a friendly attitude.  In fact, our server was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"First visit and I will give this place another try. Sat out on the patio and it is very nice, a bit loud - but the covered area is a nice touch. Food was decent, a bit expensive for the offerings but it is st Clair west, so expected. My issues were the service. Our server had no clue about any of the wine list and did not once fill our cups after the initial pour. We mentioned several times we were not in a rush, but it did not seem to matter. I asked to see the dessert menu and our bill was presented. And so ended our meal. Seeing that it was one of the first nice nights, the place was busy so I am giving the service a mulligan and will try again."}
{"text":"The food is really good.   The service is quite slow,  so go there only when you have time.   Also this place does not accept debit :("}
{"text":"An oasis for foodies in the developing St.Clair and Christie area.  The vibrant patio may have been a better dining experience for our group of seven, as the noise level in the restaurant combined with smoke/fumes from the kitchen impacted our ability to enjoy what appeared to be a nice menu.  Service, while friendly, was new and slow.  I had the mussels w/coconut and curry.  This should be a staple dish, as it is a cornerstone for French cuisine and relatively straight forward.  Sad to report that the quality of the mussels would be grocery store comparable.  Small and poorly formed.  The sauce was great and the frites were also really good.  Hard to believe they would skimp on the quality of the actual mussel.  Other diners in our group were satisfied with their choices.  I will definitely try it again, and will opt for a table outside or during the week."}
{"text":"I went to the Rushton with 2 friends on a Saturday night for a girl's night. I called ahead but was told they don't take reservations! Luckily we arrived at 7 pm and there was one table left in the entire restaurant. About half an hour later the bar was packed with people waiting for tables.   First impressions- The ambiance was nice and the lights were set at the perfect level. LOVED the red curtain you have to walk into the enter the restaurant. It was super crowded! The tables are so close together I was worried that it would be awkward. Aside from a couple beside us who would not stop staring, I didn't really mind the crowd after a while, it was nice that we felt surrounded by people but were kind of in our own world.    We were so-so on our waitress. She was very knowledgeable about the dishes, but brought us the wrong bottle of wine. I will admit that we didn't catch it right away and we let her open it, so we were partially to blame,  but nonetheless it was nowhere near the wine we had ordered so we wondered if she had paid attention at all to our request? It was a bit pricier that the original bottle and she was nice enough to give it to us at the cheaper price as long as we kept it our little secret (woops... not so much of a secret now i guess). One of my friends finished her dish, to which our server commented \"WOW I can't believed you finished the whole thing, it's HUGE!\" Yikes. That is definitely something you should never say to a female guest. We all had a laugh over it but i think my friend might have been a tad offended.   All this being said, the food was AMAZING. We split the Rushton Salad - great as long as you like blue cheese and bitter greens- and an order of coconut shrimp - pretty average but we loved the asian style slaw that it came served on. One friend had the Lobster Linguini, which came with a pesto sauce, I got to try it and it was really tasty. My other friend and I each got the NY steak served with a green pea risotto and sauteed kale, which unfortunately is not on their menu but being served as a feature for the evening. The steak was cooked perfectly, so tender and juicy, and the risotto Ah! the RISOTTO! I dreamt about it weeks later.   We split the Rushton Trio for dessert, a plate consisting of a mini slice of pecan pie (AH-mazing) of chocolate truffle cake (also fab) and of cheesecake (my least favourite but still tasty)   The manager came to our table a couple of times to pour our wine and to introduce himself, it made us feel super welcome.   All in all, we had a great night. I highly recommend this place to all my friends and I can't wait to go back and try out more items from their menu."}
{"text":"I love this place especially at night! I order my usual food which is the mini Turkey Burgers and it's the best! Servers are very pleasant, they have best cozy patio, great beer selection and good music!!"}
{"text":"Overall very good. We got the warm mushroom salad which was very good and then we ordered sea food plater for 2 and it was so big that I would change the name at the menu to:  sea food plater for 6 the bad thing is when you get such a big dish, something is missing... But beside that very nice atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"Had the seafood platter thing and a glass of red wine.   Red wine was served room temperature.   Ingredients of the seafood platter weren't all that fresh."}
{"text":"We dined here recently on their gorgeous patio (which is nicely shaded for dinner!) and it was good.  Our waiter was very attentive, helpful and polite; he made us feel very welcome.  The food was not as good as our first visit here about 2 years ago (when the food was 5/5 stars).  We ordered the exact same dishes as last time (caesar salads and burgers) but somehow, they were not as good as we remembered them.  The salads had actual giant chunks of the lettuce base in them (which we picked out and put on side plates/it was not mentioned by anyone).  The salads just weren't as \"wow\" as last time.  The burgers were good but again, not \"wow\".  Small thing, but weird - the bread basket at the beginning of the meal - had 3 (small) pieces of bread in it.  Exactly one piece per person at our table.  Prices were acceptable but the food could have made the prices a bit more acceptable.  Overall, it was good and fine but not enough for a third visit or a recommendation to friends.  Lastly, there is no children's menu so I ended up just splitting the adult meals onto a plate for our son (who was equally unimpressed with the food overall).  It wouldn't be hard to throw a kid's menu together (even a limited choice of 3 entrees - mini burger, pasta or chicken fingers - you can't go wrong) given the demographics* of the neighbourhood.  *lots of people with kids within walking distance looking for a decent place to eat!"}
{"text":"Heard quite a bit (mainly mixed responses) about this restaurant from friends who use to work there and friends who dine there often. It's in a great cozy location on St. Clair and what looks like a great summer patio.   Service was a little slower than usual but they knew things were running behind and definitely did their best to be as hospitable as possible.  The dishes for the most part were alright. Nothing really popped out to me or made me stop for a moment. Although the lamb sliders with the blue cheese nearly threw me off my rocker. Way too large and strong of a dollop of cheese on a such a tiny burger.    I have to say that my feelings are mixed and I'm hoping a second visit to The Rushton can only go up from where I feel now."}
{"text":"HOLLLLLLD A MINUTE, did you say, you gave away my table because I was ten minutes late for a birthday reservation I made a week before, even when I had the courtesy to phone 2 days before to let you know my party of 11 would only be 8?  Th answer is yes.  Saturday night, with a large birthday party and nowhere to go my family and friends abided the horrible service because we did not want to be stranded without restaurant in some other section of the city.  Scrunched up into the dunce's corner of the restaurant, drinkless and stressed, we waited 2 hours for for our table and when we were finally seated, we waited another hour and a half for our mediocre food.  The only item above par in this long anticipated meal was the side order of sweet potato fries and really, who can mess up deep fried and breaded carbohydrates?  From the bottom of my heart, I implore you, do not give this place your business, the food cannot mitigate your upset stomach after its been turned by the obnoxious owner and his sad staff."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been here too many times to count.  I have never been disappointed by anything on the menu!!!!  The patio is awesome, decor is great, and the food is delicious. I highly recommend the caeser and the salmon! But you really can't go wrong with anything you try."}
{"text":"We decided to try the Rushton out because we had loved Ferro and the two are connected.  It was a totally different vibe.  I liked the fact that it was relaxed and laid back.  We were seated pretty quickly, having just walked the scant 10 minutes to get there.  (I love our neighbourhood!) We began with risotto with creamy saffron sauce, lemon and seafood. It was the small size, but good enough for a meal if you are not that hungry.  We shared it.  I thought it was amazing.  There was no skimping out on the seafood.  The texture was, to me, excellent and risotto is just brutal to get right.  I've made it a few times.  I know how tough it is (So much work!!).  My wife was not so happy with the lemon, yet I rather liked it.  Different strokes I suppose.  For dinner, I had the steak frites and creamy wild muchrooms. Now, I had not been that hungry when I arrived, so the appetiser had done a number on my appetite, but I will say that I gave it a valiant effort.  The steak was cooked exactly perfectly (medium rare) and the regular and sweet potato fries were amazing.  I will say that I am a mushroom fiend, so I'm always inclined to love mushrooms, but the creamy mushrooms were just amazing.  I mean that.  I was so glad to have leftovers the next day.  My wife had the seafood linguine and greatly enjoyed it.  I wish I had left room to try a bit myself.  For dessert, I finished with the mango sorbet. It was very good, but seemed to have more of a gelato texture; not really a bad thing, just not as light.  My wife had  the blueberry sorbet and Milanese vanilla gelato. She loved the gelato, but was not so keen on the blueberry sorbet.  She also loved my mango sorbet (cough, cough).  I, however, thought the blueberry sorbet was amazing.    While I would not normally name the server, mostly since I'm terrible with names, I will say that we had Simon for a server and he did a great job.  He was knowledgeable and quite funny.  He seemed to get that we could handle some joking about and went with it.  As a result, we just had a plain great time too.  Overall, I would recommend the Rushton.  It's a little bit of everything cuisine-wise, which is not a bad thing.  I'm looking forward to trying most of it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Prepare to spend a little more for better service, ambiance, and food . Portions could be larger but thankfully our waitress was generous with our dip and bread"}
{"text":"Our department had a work lunch there today.  There were 17 of us and we were lucky enough to sit on the patio.  We had a set menu but there was still enough to choose from.  I started with a salad ... it was nice and fresh.  I had steak and roasted potatoes as my main (I substituted the roasted potatoes for fries) ... it was good but I found the serving small.  For dessert, I had a chocolate and raspberry tartufo which was good.  The patio would be nice to people-watch with a glass of wine."}
{"text":"The Good:  - great vibe, atmosphere and great patio - great staff and service  The Bad (only if you're a vegetarian): The description of the veggie burger \"Home made spiced 10oz. patty of minced vegetables, green lentils and kidney beans served with tomato, onion, lettuce and a side of frites \"  Minced to them must mean pureed, as the patty was just a weird wet paste that was formed into the shape of a burger and then..egh..DEEP FRIED. Also based on the yellow/orange colour of the burger there is no way that green lentils were used. As someone who actually makes her own awesome veggie burgers all the time I do have to say this one was a bit sad. You shouldn't have to deep fry it in order for it to hold its shape. It should be able to hold its own.  My friend didn't really enjoy her grilled calamari, she said there was just too much going on in the plate and the calamari didn't shine."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had an outstanding experience at The Rushton for our one-year anniversary. Our server was attentive and the food was prepared to perfection. I thoroughly enjoyed my ravioli dish and my boyfriend had the steak frites (I stole a few bites and it too was excellent). We shared a creme brulee for dessert.... yes, also delicious.  This is not the place to go if you are in a rush to eat (no pun intended). Our meal was well-paced (about 15-25 minutes between each 'course' - drinks,bread, entree and dessert) and despite eating a lot of food, neither of us felt overly full at the end of the meal.   I'll definitely be visiting again! (Particularly to try the seafood platter which looked OUTSTANDING from the table next to us)."}
{"text":"very nice neighbourhood restaurant. Went there with another couple. The service was great...Food was ok, not great. Too much sauce and too many ingredients basically...Was the recurring theme on everything we had,- the maple shrimps, the chicken, lobster pasta, gnocchi and beet salad. First couple of bites were great, but then it just got a bit too much....Would come back though, but would tell them to be a bit moderate (and this is coming from a big guy...)"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to The Rushton and I was there for lunch on the patio and I was left very disappointed and regretted my visit there.  Being a beautiful hot day took a table in the middle of the covered patio which I found not much of a great patio experience as the large heavy vinyl awning blocked a lot of light and the few signs warning you that you are being video taped felt a bit ghetto (though when I was there I did see a few really sketchy guys with overly gelled up hair and big blingy sunglasses).  I ordered the steak salad which was extremely disappointing. The steak was cooked to my liking (medium rare) and seasoned well, but the cut of meat was of poor quality and wasn't sliced properly -- it was sliced along the grain, not across, so the meat was extremely tough and chewy and had bits of sinew or gristle which I had to spit out. This should have been trimmed off. This was the second time I ordered this dish and I thought the first time was an oversight. This was really bad because I spent most of my lunch labourously chewing my steak and hardly taking to my friends.  The service was pretty slow too, as the simple orders at my table took more than an hour to arrive and it took a long time to find the waitress to get the bill. I usually have my 3-strike rule, but these were two really bad strikes and will not be coming back again!"}
{"text":"I had a pretty good time at the Rushton. We grabbed a few seats outside and even on a Sunday night it was bustling. The patio is covered and dim, lit only by hanging candles. You can actually smell the wax. When ordered four small plates the waitress screwed up her face, skeptical about the surface area of our table. She was right to worry. The small plates are anything but, which meant we were truly stuffed.   We tried the duck confit rolls, coconut shrimp, a triplet of tiny lamb burgers and a fancy-pants poutine with braised lamb. All was delicious. I hope to come here again.   Obligatory Title Pun: I might have a c-RUSH on this place.  Menu Readability: White swiss type on a desaturated photo? How two-thousand and late.  Need to mention: I have not been inside the restaurant proper, so what the hell do I know?  What this place teaches me about myself: I'd probably run my arm through a blender as long as the instructions were in Helvetica."}
{"text":"This place seems to be hit or miss. I have been a handful of times now. this past visit I ordered a salad I had loved the last time I was in the restaurant only this time it felt like the plate had been put together in too much of a rush. The warm mushroom salad had oily mushrooms an under dressed arugula.  We had made a reservation for 8:30, arrived 5 minutes early and were told we would be sat in 10 minutes. 10 minutes turned into an hour and 15 minutes! The server and hostess were very sweet and apologetic about the situation but I was disappointed that no manager came by to apologize.  Asides from the waiting forever fiasco the server was great. While I didn't like my salad this time last time it really was delicious.  I had a bite of my boyfriends burger and fries it was perfectly cooked and the fries were crispy. We ordered the maple chilli shrimp and the grille calamari to start- maple shrimp was surprisingly tasty! The sweet tomato sauce with eggplant and buffalo mozzarella was a unique combination. The calamari was nothing special. Overall- Great atmosphere, sometimes great food, sometimes terribly long waits for tables that you've already reserved..."}
{"text":"I didn't dine in but my friends did. Decent prices and good cocktails. Went during Salsa on St Clair, busy but we got seated thanks to a friend. Reminds me of bigger chains but with a few unique offerings. The sliders look  good but it's a small portion. Free table bread with red bean dip was provided."}
{"text":"Great food, with great taste , but i find the portions a bit to small, specially for the appetizers, they also have really high prices and in my opinion i could go somewhere else and eat better and cheaper."}
