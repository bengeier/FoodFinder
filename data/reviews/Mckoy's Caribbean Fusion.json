{"text":"Service was good festivals were good... jerk chicken was about 3 days old all you could taste was browning and pimento seeds, curry goat was nothing but big bone, fat and flavorless. I asked for a curry goat and jerk chicken mixed which I paid extra for with no problem but they charged me for a large curry goat and extra for the chicken and there was more 3 day old chicken then goat.....feeling robbed"}
{"text":"Amazing service from Keke and Gifty! Fresh festival made right in front of me...mmmm. Had the jerk chicken - delicious and flavorful. Will be returning soon."}
{"text":"McKoy's just opened this week in Clarkson. I came here on Wednesday and had the curry goat. My dinner was so delicious that I brought my husband and daughter today (two days later. My husband and I had the jerk chicken and my daughter had the jerk poutine. My daughter said her poutine tasted good but was spicy! Just the way it should be. This is the real deal - couldn't get more authentic without a plane ticket to Mo'Bay."}
{"text":"They took 10 minutes before taking my order. Meanwhile a male staff member was just shifting through the playlist looking for something to play.

I ordered the ox tail which was already over priced + they didn't have coleslaw so I agreed to substitute this with steamed vegetables, only to find that this was forgotten from the order. 

I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Been twice.  Chicken Roti was really good.   Very fresh.  Nice staff.  Curry chicken and rice was really tasty. Some tables and lots of customers getting takeout.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Recently went to this place for lunch today. My friend and got a small order of ox tail and special portion of jerk chicken. Jerk chicken is special everyday and Monday along with other ones throughout the week. Serving size: special is the smallest them small then large. 

The ox tail was so soft and it comes off the bones so easily. The sauce was tasty too. The jerk chicken was not dry and the taste was good though I was hoping to have more spiced. But it's definitely worth the try. I would definitely get the ox tail again and next time try the curry goat and the jerk poutine."}
{"text":"Had there curry goat twice now and can honestly say the best I had ...its juicey fall of the bone goodness . Also had there jerk chicken I would say it's very average but good as well"}
{"text":"Just recently opened, a usual factor with all Jamaican carribean restaurants never seem to have anything on the menu available..
No dumpling
No festivals
No soup"}
