{"text":"I had the Raging Cajun burger and it was incredible!  Great service and more of 50's cafe than a Tex Mex place.  I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and the food was very good. The only thing that I didn't like was the waiting time for the menu. We were very hungry and we waited 10-15 mins before the waitress brought us the menu. At that time, there were 2 other tables filled. But the food was prepared quickly and it was good. The portion of the fries was ok but not too generous. Recommend it to anyone who wants a good burger in the south-shore area."}
{"text":"We were two couples and went there on Thanksgiving of all nights. We were amazed at all the different types of burgers that were available along with sides etc and really enjoyed the casual and old style diner feel to the place. The burgers were delicious and we were completely full and happy when we left there, we will definitely return again and bring others with us. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Best burger on the South shore. Great service with a smile. Welcoming dining area. Delicious wings as well. Beer also available. Love this place."}
{"text":"The restaurant is really good!  The waitress/owner is super nice. The burgers and nachos are delicious. Prices are super reasonable. I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in the area!  Their burgers were amazing and their tacos are the best!  You can't find tacos like these on the south shore. The staff at the restaurant is so friendly!"}
{"text":"Great burger. Good portion of meat and good combination of toppings. Small eating area but clean. Loved the onion rings. Will return."}
{"text":"Our go to burger place! Quiet, cozy, and quality food! The staff is friendly beyond belief and the menu offers maybe 25 burger options as well as wings, salads, wraps, and even milkshakes. The price is reasonable for the portion and the waiting time is average since the majority of the time there's only one cook and one waitress. Overall, in our opinion, it's much better than a fast food burger joint AND a sit down restaurant that would specialize in burgers."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! They use fresh ingredients and are always changing the specials that we can't get enough of. Great prices too."}
{"text":"This place is just amazing ... I usually don't eat fast food .. But seriously this place is great the meet/condiments are fresh .. The bread is tasty !! Fries lovers: here is the place to come ! Portions are very generous and the cost are under 10$ per plate.  Recommend 100%"}
{"text":"Three and half. The service was really good and I liked the milkshake. I thought the burger was decent but I was not a huge fan of the fries. Though to be fair I'm not a real burger person. My spouse really liked his burger. Lots of choices for sure."}
{"text":"You want a place to eat good burgers? On the south shore of Montreal? Well this is the place I suggest! This is a lovely restaurant with mouth watering burgers because it is known for its burgers of course!!!! But there are also a lot of other plates that I will come back and try! The staff is very nice, the decor is nice, everything is nice!!!! The burgers are done to perfection. This place has very reasonable prices. There is nothing else to say, you have to go there to know! It's a must! I'm glad I discovered this place! 5 stars well earned!!! There's a reason why it's very well-rated you know!!!!"}
{"text":"Les ailes de poulets sont excellentes. Les meilleurs de la région. Un très grand choix de burgers. Les quelques un que j'ai essayé étaient très bon."}
