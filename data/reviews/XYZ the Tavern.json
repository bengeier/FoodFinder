{"text":"Great brunch! Cheap drinks, nice patio, cool place to start the night out at, the staff is also pretty awesome :)"}
{"text":"Another good meal and friendly, efficient service - we come with babies, so we mean that when we say it!

Nice easy place for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"This place is casual and cool, in the fun Detroit shoreway neighborhood. They have a great patio as well as garage doors on the main bar that are open when the weather is nice. The food is great for bar food, but don't expect any culinary wonders. They also have a great brunch, so be sure to check it out on the weekend!"}
{"text":"The workers here are really hip.   The go with the flow even on weekend nights when the hours are the busiest.  Great place to meet up with friends and have a good time."}
{"text":"Went to this place last night for Cleveland beer week. They had a taste of Chicago featuring 3 floyds, revolution, 5 rabbits. I am huge 3 floyds fan but they only had one and surprisingly I liked the revolution the best. 
Anyway craft beers were a nice 5 a piece and the sampler was a very reasonable 10. I dont have a problem spending $ on good eats or drinks but I appreciate a fair if not affordable price. This place is huge for the price. I would pay double and give it 4 stars. (management please dont read this)

As we were about 20 minutes from home and beers were flowing we decided to try the menu. We started with the black bean and chorizo soup. Obviously home made love went into this as it was creamy and spicy with great flavor. Could have used some cilantro to brighten it or a dab of sour cream to lighten it. Otherwise wonderful. 

Next we tried the broccoli tempura. What the heck right? Now we all have had tempura that was over coated with gobs of uncooked batter everywhere...this was far from that. The guy in the back knew how to prepare this. The broccoli heads were essentially cut in half and left whole then battered and flash fried. They had to have blanched them and peeled the stalks because the florets all the way to the stalks were perfectly done. So you ask why am I spending this much time on a tempura dish? Well they give you not one, two but three sauces! These were awesome and were a sweet/sour chilli that layered the bottom, A siracha mayo on the side and a plum sauce to boot. This dish is for two or more to share. 

We split a walleye sandwich that was gone as soon as it got to the table. The filet was fresh and had a wonderful tartar sauce. 

Service was outstanding and barmaid was working her butt off as the place got very crowded by 630. Will try again soon and if same then this place may get the 5th star."}
{"text":"Good food and  great beer selection. I had the chicken and waffles. Excellent   My wife had the pulled pork platter. BBQ sauce was awesome.  Would like to try it again in the summer when they open the doors to the outside"}
{"text":"Drove down Detroit looking for a quick bite to eat before a show last Friday night and decided upon XYZ... knowing it was a weekend night and we didn't plan ahead, I figured we'd end up with bar food, and we were ok with that. Very pleasantly surprised with XZY! I have been to ABC in Ohio City, but had never eaten at either. We sat at the bar, had a beer, were impressed with the menu so ordered sandwiches right away since we were in a bit of a rush.

Salmon BLT- Excellent! Big sandwich... took half to go! Kettle chips may or may not have been homemade, but either way, they were good!
Falafel wrap- Good as well!  I usually skip the wrap part, but this wrap was grilled and really delicious... thick cut fries that I'd recommend with some malt vinegar! 

I think our bill was around $28 for two beers and two sandwiches... which I find perfectly reasonable! I'd definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"A group of us went in for happy hour and dinner before trivia. I wanted to like this place so badly. Everything was just off. Maybe the problem was that this is just more of a place to get drinks than dinner. 
 CONS: The food was just gross. The chips had no seasoning, the falafel was soggy, and the grilled chicken sandwich tasted like charcoal. Everything looked/ tasted microwaved or like something you would buy at an airport stand out of necessity. The service was not great either; it took over 20 minutes to get our checks and it wasn't even that busy. 
PROS: patio, beer, music, pickles."}
{"text":"Signage says \"pizza by the slice\", but not quick. Ordered to go, said it would be 5-10 minutes...20 minutes later, we find our pizza slices sitting on the bar. Not staffed enough. Friendly bartender, but overall poor service. Pizza not what we expected, nothing special about it, no hand thrown crust."}
{"text":"XYZ is a really great new watering hole for the Gordon Square Arts District. Wonderful beer selection and amazing food.  The tempura broccoli was excellent."}
{"text":"As a big fan of ABC Tavern, perhaps I was expecting too much -- that XYZ would also have that effortlessly casual, but fun vibe while also being quirky and serving great (bar) food, that its upper alphabet sister bar has. Instead, I found XYZ a bit lacking -- my biggest issue is the space, which felt mainly like a box without much personality. The service was wonderful, attentive and knowledgeable, absolutely no complaints there. The food ranged from great (tempura broccoli and cheesy grits) to barely mediocre (a bland black bean burrito). Now, it was busy and the neighborhood is fantastic, so I have no doubt this place will do well, but at least on first blush, I give it an \"eh\"."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the last time I came here, I ordered the Broccoli Tempura appetizer. I was expecting the appetizer to come out at smaller broccoli florets, but instead, three full size heads of broccoli came out on the plate. It looked like the entire heads of broccoli were dipped in the tempura batter and tasted very burnt. Instead of the tempura being the only crispy part of the dish, the broccoli underneath and expose to the fryer were too crisp and burnt. I definitely warn anyone thinking this is an appetizer to order, to be warned that it does not come out as small individual pieces of battered broccoli. 

I did really like the beer selection and atmosphere of the restaurant. Also, the BBQ smelled amazing when we parked being the restaurant. I'm still undecided if I am going to give this place another try after the appetizer fail."}
{"text":"We like this place.  As a New Yorker, I'm a snob about pizza but XYZ's is pretty good.  We often stop in for a beer and slice during their happy hour.  Their other food has never been disappointing either.  Nothing crazy fantastic, but good food.  I got the noodles with veggies last time.  You can get a protein on top but I don't eat meat and am not a fan of tofu so I opted out.  Everything was cooked perfectly--veggies were crunchy and tender, noodles were chewy and delicious but I wouldn't have minded if there had been more veggies.  I guess you're really supposed to put a protein on there.  Also--the sauce was sweet chili which is good but I had sort of expected something house made, or something that is specifically for noodles.  I usually dip spring rolls in sweet chili and it felt out of place on noodles.  Beardyman got the Reuben and loved it.  I ate his french fries and told him that they were too good to compromise with ketchup."}
{"text":"Decent price and great food, they have great pork but everything else I've tried is good too. My friend said that his Ruben sand which was the best he's ever had . However, service is touch and go."}
{"text":"Service was slow. Waitress never checked in with us on our order. Order ended up taking over an hour which for a pizza is excessive. Avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"I used to come here when they first opened everything was really good but unfortunately now there food as completely lost it's flavor there is nothing really special about it anymore and there drinks are way over priced! Xyz please step up your food game and your service definitely needs work took me 15 min just to get a drink"}
{"text":"The brunch was definitely good. I have no complaints but I also haven't been in any hurry to make it back. I ordered the salmon croissant and my girlfriend ordered the French toast. We were both happy and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The rye toast was delicious. Warm, toasty, and buttered on both sides. Tasted like it was toasted on a flat-top grill with other delicious brunchy foods."}
{"text":"Great to have a spot like this at Gordon Square. Stopped in for a pre-movie brew on Sat afternoon. Great beer choices, good service and nice/fun atomosphere. In fact, we liked it so much we returned after the movie for food and drink. Sat on the patio which suits the neighborhood and XYZ. App dip was great with plentiful dippers. Followed with gnocchi for me which was lovely pasta, perfectly cooked and nice/light sauce. Dining buddy had a fish sandwich of some sort and raved about it.

Because we were early and on the patio, noise wasn't an issue at all.  

It's on my go-to list...."}
{"text":"It's just ok. The atmosphere is cool. Service is subpar. Food is ok."}
{"text":"Was in Cleveland for the rock and roll hall of fame induction and had eaten at a few other overrated and overpriced restaurants downtown my friend and I drove over to the other side of town and found this great little place.it was a beautiful day, so we ate outside in the cute little courtyard. My friend got breakfast eggs, 5 strip of thick quality slab bacon and delicious toast. I wasn't very hungry so I ordered the grilled cheese with bacon and tomato, it was so delicious I ate every bit of it and told everyone that was there to order it to share even if they were just there for drinks. I told everyone else I met to try this place.we started off with mimosas and our bill was only $30 - same cost as 1 lost appetizer and 2 beers at the downtown restaurant. This place is awesome! Super friendly waitress and the food is off the hook! Worth the drive across town!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks and dinner after work this week and have a very nice experience. The staff was very friendly and attentive, but not overly so. Glasses were never empty, but they didn't hover annoyingly. Very nice. 

The restaurant itself is really cool. Spent some time trying to figure out what this building was before XYZ. A mechanic's garage? Who knows? The east wall of the space has 2 huge garage doors that open onto an enclosed alleyway that I'm sure makes a nice patio in the summer. 

The selection of whiskey on the menu is tremendous. I think the quote from our waitress was \"there are 101 different whiskeys to chose from.\" I was in a bourbon-mood and was not disappointed. The selection is great and reasonably priced. The beer and wine selection was also good, although I did not partake in barley sodas. 

The food was very tasty and reasonably priced. I had the falafel wrap with the sauteed green beans as my side. The wrap was tasty, very flavorful, but I would have liked the falafel to be crispy...it was not...but the flavors were so good, I didn't mind! We also split an order of the fries with a side of brown gravy. The fries were perfectly cooked, crispy, salty, tossed with herbs and green onions. Excellent! 

I would have to agree with the previous reviews...even with only a third of the tables filled, (it was a rainy Monday evening,) it was very loud in the place. It wasn't any specific thing...the music wasn't too loud, the traffic wasn't too loud, etc...I think it's a combo of all of the ambient noises coupled with the all-brick surfaces in the restaurant that just bounce everything around in there. It got hard to hear my friends sitting across from me at the table. I can't imagine what it's like on a busy weekend night. Some strategically placed acoustic tiles would be very helpful. 

All around, a really good experience."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday Brunch, the Eggs Benedict was fantastic.  Interior decoration is really cool too, can't wait to go here when it's warm and they can open the doors!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the fare here. Everything else was good: service. decor, etc. I'm actually surprised there are so many 4 star reviews for this place.

I had the fried chicken and waffles. It comes with a gravy side which tasted like northing,  and I mean that literally:  the gravy had no taste. The fried chicken was 4 chicken tenders basically, which is fine, except that the breading on the chicken again had no flavor.  It was crunchy but the breading had no flavor. It was as if the breading was made without any spices. The waffle was okay. But how hard is it to screw up a waffle?  overall very disappointing.

My girlfriend had the Cleveland cheese steak. Again, neither of us liked her dish. The cheese was weird. The best thing about her dish was the fries. 

Maybe there are other good things on the menu. But we got two bad dishes that really didn't rise to the 4 star rating this place has on Yelp.  I suspect some of these reviews are friends or family of the owners. Really don't understand."}
{"text":"I  always like the food. Sandwiches are always good. Tried the Cleveland Cheese steak last time and it was really awesome! BBQ Brisket!!! The pizza gets the job done for NY style and they have always have a decent selection of draft beers and the standard ABC/XYZ Bottle list
Service and bartenders are hit or miss and the crowd can range from hip & cool to creepy and grunge. (I once walked into the bathroom and interrupted two older guys finishing up something....drugs, sex or a combo of both)  I still like it there though and they serve food late! Worth a stop if your in Gordon Square, just make sure to knock twice on the bathroom door!"}
{"text":"Great lunch, great service. Thank you to Stephen! One thing, though... dont shake a shot woth soda in it (it ends up flat :( ). Other than that, you were the sweetest!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed stopping in here late nights because you know what to expect. Recently, I wanted to be a bit more adventurous and made the trip on a Saturday afternoon. We were stuck with a brunch menu until 2PM...whatever...I get it...Detroit-Shoreway is a \"brunchy\" part of town. The Saturday brunch is not \"brunchy\" enough. Too heavy on breakfast food and some very mediocre wraps. What really bugged me (call me snooty) was that the Sysco brand condiments and jellies were proudly displayed. I think it's unfair to charge $3 for a side of not too tasty potatoes when you're using pretty much the worst ketchup in the history of ketchup. House Recipe IS AWFUL!!! Overall, not impressed...I think I'll stick to having drinks here."}
{"text":"Usually I love this place but just had pretty terrible service. The bartender got my drink wrong. Didn't believe me when I mentioned it. Got part of my order wrong. Defended herself again when I mentioned that. My toast was almost completely burnt. And lastly a different bartender cleared the water that I was still drinking the second after I closed my tab. Pretty ridiculous considering the usual good food and good service I've gotten here over the past four years."}
{"text":"Best bar staff in town. Bar list is for beer lovers and whiskey drinkers. Food menu could stand on its own at a bistro. I love this place. But this is a bar, people, so don't come expecting a quiet restaurant setting."}
{"text":"This place has a pretty good whiskey menu and a pretty solid beer selection, too. I'm not a wine drinker, but they do have wine, as well. The food is pretty good. A very nice variety and fairly inventive.

The place has a great atmosphere and is on a great street. In the summer, I love the patio into the alley via the roll-up garage doors."}
{"text":"Couldn't ask for more in a neighborhood pub. Food was good, service was prompt. Although it was loud, I knew what to expect before I got there. I would return."}
{"text":"Lots of beer and tons of bourbon options.
Wait staff excellent and friendly.

Food isn't special but it feels right for the neighborhood.

Downside - very loud. The hard ceiling, had walls, hard bar top, hard floor make the place almost intolerable for conversation when it's even only 70% full. They need sound dampeners for the ceiling."}
{"text":"I'm sure this will get filtered due to Yelp's wonderful policy.  First off the food is very good.  The problem is how loud it is!!  There were 3 of us at a table and I could not even hear them talking.  The high ceilings and brick don't take in any of the echos."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, brunch, happy hour, late night, dinner. I live in the neighborhood, the bar is pretty cool so I WANT to like it. I just can't. I know everyone says the pizza is amazing and the food is great, but in my opinion it's just so so. It's lacking in flavor. Nothing I've had there except for my brunch was really any good. 

There are so many places in this area with cool bars and great food so we rarely go unless a friend wants to grab drinks. We gave up eating here."}
{"text":"Visited here for the first time. Reasonable prices. Nice setting. It was loud, but it's a bar! No big deal. The staff was awesome. All super friendly. Had a great time joking around with them. Thanks for the fun. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Not very diverse. If you want to be a hard ass - fine for you. If you're into being talked about by patrons and feeling patronized it's your place."}
{"text":"XYZ never seems to disappoint. It's always a welcomed to the site to see Harris working the bar. Very knowledgeable manager that is very accommodating,   hard-working and super fun to talk to. 

I rate their pizza above average, and I even deem it better than Edison's in Tremont... no joke.  You can't go wrong with $5 pizza and beer slice special! HUGE slice! Also, I highly recommend you tried they are mozzarella tomato bruschetta... so go to nibble on!  The alley patio that they have is excellent to host an intimate group of friends.  I'm proud to have XYZ as my neighbourhood go to Bar."}
{"text":"The table AND bar seat service have been absolutely horrible lately. The food is pretty decent, except for anything from the weekend brunch menu. It really isn't anything that special. But, whatever you decide to order expect the worst.
 
Recently, with 2 other people, we waited a good 5 minutes to figure out who would serve us. When we were, it took even longer to get our drinks and take a food order, of which was not taken correctly, if at all. After that, she just seemed to disappear for whatever reason and never bother to refill any of our drinks or settle our check. Eventually someone else apologetically picked up her lame attempt at serving.

Then there was the time I decided to try there brunch again. She was more involved in some dudes story at the Willie Nelson  concert than to focus on perhaps refilling a drink for myself and whoever was across from me. That, and, taking my card to settle the bill but completely forgetting to swipe it. Just disappeared and left it on the other side of the bar like a dope. Really fucking pissed off about that. Eventually she remembered she actually had a job to do and closed it out, with a half ass apology to follow. 

So, if you are lucky enough to get one right away  you can expect to have a server right up until your food is served. After that, well, no one really gives a shit. Definitely starting to rethink how I should tip anyone based on what I've been dealing with lately. Also rethinking how much more I really want to come back any time soon."}
{"text":"We walked in with a group of 8, understanding that sometime when a place is busy that it might take a minute to accommodate, but we waited 20 minutes to be sat, then it took the waitress 10
Minutes to even acknowledge us. ( the same lady made a comment that she could not seat the 8 of us earlier) so 2 people sat at the bar, 6 sat at the table. In which then the bartender had not helped the 2 at the bar, so they left. Which then made the rest of us sitting at the table leave as well. I would have to say this was the worst customer service I have ever had. The manager, whom I guess was the bartender too, never helped apologized or anything... I have heard reviews about the food being very good but the wait staff was horrible and not worth the supposedly great food."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. Living in Detroit shoreway for 5 years, I have been waiting for a place like this. Great neighborhood alternative to w. 25th. Detroit shoreway reminds me of 25th bier market area 5 years ago. I love the bar stools facing the window. You can throw back a few and see the wonderful traffic both on foot and street...  It's really entertaining!"}
{"text":"The place was cool, very welcoming. I had the Reuben, which was great. Definitely a chill spot with your friends."}
{"text":"Nice laid back bar with a nice view of The Gordon square scenery. Only drawback to liquor selection is no Patron. However they do offer an excellent tequila called Milagro. Try it, you will be pleasantly surprised. Now to the food. Very surprising to find such good, well rounded quisine in a bar. The best thing on the menu is the ribs!! Authentic smokehouse, pork baby back ribs are some of the best I've ever had. You can go there just for the ribs and it would be worth it!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! i've had a hard time finding the perfect food/bar combo in Cleveland but I think this is it. The food was delicious and perfectly understated. I feel like too many restaurants in this neck of the woods try way too hard when developing the menu and it never works. So its nice to see one that does. I'll go back... a lot. My only complaint is the amount of old people drinking Corona there. It was odd. Must've caught the early bird special and not realized it."}
{"text":"If you have ever been to ABC its similar in so many ways. Most importantly it is an overall great place to go out after work or to meet up to start a night of bar hopping at.

It is really loud when it is packed but I wouldn't say thats a bad thing, It's just the kind of place it is. If you prefer a quite place try it a little earlier in the night or maybe get a patio seat in the warm months. I love a lively bar and its no louder then any other place I frequent.

The food has always been consistent, good, and really creative for a bar. 
Chicken and Waffles?
Deep fried pickles on a burger?
Broccoli Tempura?
YES PLEASE!!!!

Is it a 5 star restaurant? no. but it's not supposed to be. XYZ is a great place and well worth checking out. 

You'll find me there for years to come"}
{"text":"I was looking for somewhere new for lunch I went to Yelp & this restaurant was 2 miles away from where I was. I am completely satisfied & will be returning. I had a simple corn beef & I loved it. Love the environment, food & customer service."}
{"text":"I took some friends here for brunch when they visited one weekend from Cincy. We ended up having to sit at the bar because it was so crowded in there for Sunday brunch, which was fine because the bartender was super nice. While she took our orders (there was 4 of us), she wasn't writing anything down, which I have always been super impressed with because I was a server before, and I could never remember what the customer ordered, even if I wrote it down. Well, I should not have been that impressed because there was one item wrong with each of our orders - I ordered bacon in my burrito and I got sausage, and there were similar situations wrong with my friends' orders (I can't remember exactly what was wrong with each). I was comped my mimosa though, so I was happy about that and all was right. Other than that snafu, I really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere of the restaurant. It got really crowded as we waited for our food, so get there early, especially if it's a football Sunday."}
{"text":"This place is one of my local go to places. They have good beer and if you love whiskey this is your place to stop! They have some sort of whiskey deal M-F. They also have a gnocchi of the day that changes everyday! Their menu appeals to everyone. This is a no frills, affordable place for friends and families alike."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say that with repeated visits to XYZ, the service and quality of food has declined...rapidly. 
On my most recent visit that warrants this update, we had a server I've never seen and another that is there all the time and recognized us.. The place was empty and it was Saturday from 8-10:30. By empty I mean no more than 5 people at the bar, two tables occupied inside and anywhere from 3-6 tables occupied on the patio...but we had to ask twice on separate occasions to get another drink. My uncle asked for a drink that never arrived. My burger was cold and all together unappetizing. I asked for broccoli and seriously got three stalks. The kicker was when I asked for the check to be split two ways for four people they were obviously put out. She said \"I don't really know what you guys got, but I'll try\" They completely messed it up. When we pointed it out, the waitress said \"Well since you guys have cash, it doesn't really matter\". She also pointed out that it was only a $5 difference...it should have been a $25 difference if it had been correct . Either way, she made me feel ridiculous for even asking to split a bill that was $100. Too bad."}
{"text":"I have never written a yelp review but after five consecutive visits, I am done. This place has the slowest service ever, every time."}
{"text":"I could write a new review every time I visit this place. You always get the best service, very quick and friendly. A great selection of beer and liquor. A bar staff capable of making whatever you ask for. Tables inside and outside and a long bar so you can sit anywhere you want depending on your mood that day. Great location right in the middle of Gordon Square too. Now comes the most important part of the review... the food. This place has some of the best food I've tried in Cleveland for some of the best prices. The happy hour deal of a huge slice of pizza and a beer for $5 is hands down the best deal in the city. Seriously this slice is bigger than you can imagine and you can get every topping you want all for five dollars! Then the pulled pork platters are to die for. The meat and the bbq are unrivaled. Every time I come here I try something new and every time I come here I am always convinced I just had the best thing on the menu. The cheesesteak is mouth watering, the club sandwich is full of flavor, the burgers are mouth watering. Even the vegetarian options are all unreal (especially the tofu wrap!). If you're really hungry you have to go with the artichoke spinach dip to start with, you won't be disappointed, trust me. Seriously, this is the perfect blend of great food, awesome atmosphere, consistently wonderful service, great location, wide alcohol selection, and unbeatable prices!"}
{"text":"I live around the corner don't go out to drink but one day I was hungry. I tried the Cleveland steak sandwich. I loved it what little my husband left for me. Went back again another time ordered two, we both were trilled. So I took my son of course I ordered the Cleveland steak sandwich my son ordered the XYZ burger it was huge we even took a picture. I will be walking to XYZ for years to come."}
{"text":"XYZ is a tale of two taverns, depending on day of the week and time of day. In that way, it reminds me of a restaurant/bar in a big college's town. 

XYZ is often a meeting spot for friends before/after a film at the Capitol. If we stop in during the week for a movie, the box-shaped dining area is nearly empty. In the day of light, with nothing distracting you from observing the decor XYZ isn't particularly impressive in any way.  The feel of the open room tavern is pretty neutral and devoid of much character. The decor is clean-lined without Applebee's type decorations. But, on a Friday/Saturday night, I can't kick the vibe that I'm on a college campus and XYZ is a meeting spot for both campus students, employees, and college town intellectuals.  The tavern is much busier and a busy bar distracts and feels warm no matter the decor; accordingly,  XYZ's decor fairs better in the dark and when it's full. 

The menu offers a greater selection of New American options than the average neighborhood bar and I've never heard a friend complain. I've not been blown away by the food, but I've always been satisfied. Friends have really enjoyed the gnocchi and pizza. There's cider on tap, and that always makes Amy happy. 

The standout feature of XYZ is the large, storefront windows that overlook the Gordon Square street-scape, as well as the small patio dining adjacent to the main bar with large, glass garage doors. There's free parking in the back, so there's no need to hunt for street spots."}
{"text":"I have been to XYZ for brunch and dinner but my most recent visit I stopped in for Lunch which is available Wednesday through Friday. 

Their happy hour pizza and beer special for $5 is pretty great but their best kept secret of XYZ is their BBQ. It's smoked on premises and the sauce is just enough tang and spice. 

They have plenty of specials during the week but keep with such a small dining room be sure to get there early."}
{"text":"The XYZ seems to be a bit confused as to what it is. The menu says upscale family restaurant, the food says gourmet, the decor says trendy night bar, the beer selection says pretty good bar, the service says melt-but-slightly-better, and the pricing says TGI Fridays.

It seems too small and too contradictory but somehow it just really works. I think its a case of superb food making up for any lack in coherence with decor and location or some fancy critic speak like that; who cares, its Yelp.

Seriously though the food is amazing. house made chips, maHOOsive pizza thats really good for really cheap, and the best chicken and waffles in Cleveland. The fried broccoli actually made me like broccoli. The gnocci is absolutely wonderfull, and the specials are always really good and not the usual \"specials\" fair if that means anything.

But what blew me away about all this was how good it was for how little it was. if you really wanted, you could have a satisfying meal for two and spend under $20 sans tip."}
{"text":"Philly Cheesesteak! The best I have had in a long time a little spicy but delicious! And the fries with gravy you have ave to try!"}
{"text":"Great little gastropub.  Food looked and smelled incredible.  I was psyched they had Kentucky Bourbon Ale on draft.  Dark wood interior.  Will go back to eat.  Only downside is the acoustics.  It is VERY LOUD in there."}
{"text":"Good food.  A lot of worthless taps.  No local brews at all.  Shame."}
{"text":"Okay, I almost go to every sunday for brunch to Xyz. I've tried chicken waffle and vegie  omelet.  Both foods are really good. I also tried theirs shrimp. Those are the best. I like the atmosphere and the crew that work there. and bar is nice and neat."}
{"text":"Their pizza is my favorite! I also love the shots of the day they have, as well as delicious pasta from Ohio City Pasta. The patio is really nice (and dog friendly) in the warm weather. Great draft beer selection, amazing staff. XYZ will always be my fave!"}
{"text":"Amazing smoked salmon.  Cool Cleveland place to watch the game.  Also a great place for breakfast on the weekend."}
{"text":"I had the tofu sandwich thing bc I'm watching my weight, the chips were pretty good too. Great service esp Briana, that may be a server I'm ns. Josh and Mallory were our bar tenders and they were awesome. Great beer list, Fast service."}
{"text":"Another WIN from the group behind the revived ABC Tavern.

They have got it going on- plenty of beers on tap, more bourbon than I have ever seen in one place, generous portions at a great value.

We will be back again & again."}
{"text":"We came for a last minute Brunch
We were a group of 8 with kids and they didn't skip a beat in finding us a place to sit. 
Service was fast, friendly, and accommodating.  Food was good, drinks were great. We left happy."}
{"text":"My friends and I are always trying to find a great place for happy hour; somewhere that has a cheap deal but still has good food.  This is the place! For just $5 Monday- Friday from 4-7 you get a craft beer and a slice of pizza. The slice you get is huge; it is about 1/4 of a whole pie! If you aren't hungry, you can get one of their happy hour beers for just $3. They had a pretty good selection of beers too. They only pick 3 but our choices were a Sam Adams IPA, Brooklyn Lager or a Left had milk stout. I think the list changes day by day so it is always something different. Pizza slices without beers are just $2 and as mentioned above, HUGE so super filling! They have a nice patio, plenty of seating and the service was great!

They have a full menu as well which looks good. I might have to check that out next time!"}
{"text":"If you are a fan of low key spot and craft beers then here is your place.  Decent beer list along with weekly specials.  Food is decent as well."}
{"text":"Stuffed the food was amazing! My bestie complains about everything.... But she loved it pizza was really good, mussles were excellent. Corn beef so juicy, and the fish was meaty, clean and crispy!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice for lunch, each time is OK to good, nothing overly special but good.  The burgers are good, the cheesesteak they are famous for is different. It is made with brisket which is great but it is kind of spicy which is unexpected for a cheesesteak.  The cheese sauce is pretty good, different but good. $12 for a cheesesteak that doesn't come with fries is a little pricey in my opinion. The service on a day when only 6-7 people were in from lunch was very slow, especially while sitting at the bar.  I have not tried the pizza yet but it looks delicious."}
{"text":"Happy hour/dinner review, NOT breakfast...

Ambiance: 3. Jukebox: check.  Patio: check.  Great atmosphere: .... well the first two are all that really gets you excited about this place.  Tables are plan, bar is standard, nothing stands out to me after multiple visits.

Cost: 4. Just barely a four.  You can find similar prices in Tremont/Ohio City if you look around, but XYZ has some good drink specials and deals.

Food Quality: 3. After seeing reviews and pictures here it looks like this may be a better breakfast/brunch spot.  But several dinner visits and I'm still underwhelmed.  Some better Chicken and Waffle options in town (think Southside), burger was standard and my chicken sandwich was a bit overdone the first time I visited.  Only highlight was good bruschetta that I can remember.  Sound beer selection.

Service: 3. They're certainly nice which is half the battle, but the help seemed discombobulated most of the time I've been of late considering how small of a place this is.  The good news even Friday night I've been able to sit down usually with no issues around prime time.  

When to return:  Apparently breakfast or brunch from what other reviews say.  Happy hour.  When you're going to the theater next door.  Standard bar food with a couple of premium items. Quick drink with a friend.  Off night during the week."}
{"text":"I came with friends for happy hour. Out of our 3 meals I don't think anyone was really happy. My friend got the brisket plate which was a fatty mess that he described as \"ok at best.\" The brisket was paper thin and at least half fat. My other friend went with a pizza and beer deal which actually provided some good savings. However, the pizza was low quality and my friend said he wouldn't order it without the beer deal. It looked like a microwave pizza. I ordered a salmon salad the walked a fine line between mediocre and unpleasant. I wouldn't order it again. 

End result: This place actually seems like a good place to have a drink, but I would never ever eat here"}
{"text":"XYZ is the kind of tavern that you can walk into, and just know that it's going to become one of your favorite watering holes. For me, ambiance and service are my main reasons for returning to a bar, and XYZ wins on both points.

On my visit, I didn't have time to try any of the food (just a quick beer and a shot of whiskey before catching a movie at Capital Theater!), but the menu had some very interesting items that I will certainly try out another time. Beer selection is very good, with plenty of choices to keep you there and not bar hopping.

The staff were very nice and attentive, without being annoying. The tavern has a very cool interior, I think it must have been an auto shop? My only complaint is about the noise level. Without anything to buffer the sounds, I had a hard time hearing my friend across the table from me. But not nearly a big enough complaint to keep me away!"}
{"text":"The food is not good. The pizza is one of the worst excuses for pizza I have ever set my teeth upon. This place is cool for about one thing. Getting drunk as a billy goat and hooking up with some dude with plugs. Or a craigslist meeting.

Peace I'm out-

{"text":"Visited with five friends and we all enjoyed our brunch choices.  I ordered the BLT with egg and avocado with a side of potatoes .  The sandwich was very tasty, the egg was cooked to my liking, and the flavors combined well (there is a delicious chipotle sauce on the sandwich). This is a four star review due to the service, and noise.  The service was polite, just not around often enough.  We moved outside and had to ask for water three times.  After we received our bill, we waited for 10 or so minutes before going inside to pay at the bar (restaurant was not busy). The restaurant/ bar was too loud to converse in (which is why our group moved outside).  Nothing horrible by any means, just needs a little improvement. 

Anyhow, food wise the brunch positively surprised all of us and we left full!"}
{"text":"For you CLE hockey fans, they have Versus + NHL Network!!!!  The staff really know their beer and whiskey! Great service.  Plenty sit-down tables for eating their delicious food."}
{"text":"YES to XYZ!

Met up with friends from out of town for a late dinner. I was coming from something else so I didn't each much. I shared the chicken & waffles with my friends (yumm -- gravy!), had the manhattan clam chowder (soup du jour) and the vegetable ratatouille. Everything that I tried was flavored well and delicious! I am craving all of them... right now. 

The drinks they have there are solid. My friends ordered a few rounds and they were impressed with the selection. The service was great too. They were gracious with us even when we were being a little clever with them at times. :) One guy had so much energy, even at 1am.  We gave him a good tip. 

Overall, the atmosphere was great -- very relaxed, esp the outside patio. The interior is very clean looking & newly renovated. We loved the look of the brick walls. Service was friendly, not disruptive or awkward, and they knew the menu well. 

There was a constant flow of people on a Sat night -- always nice for Cleveland.

Overall, I'm happy that XYZ is an addition to the Gordon Square Arts District. I hope this neighborhood continues to grow!"}
{"text":"hard not to eat here all the time!  hubby and i go and always sit at the bar (best service right?) they knew our name and remembered it from each visit after that 1st. HOW AWESOME IS THAT? the gnocchi are always good and so is the cheesy grits.  i also like the fact that if hubby is out of town and i need some adult conversation, i can go here alone and sit at the bar and feel comfortable (sorry - old fashioned). if i am out of town, they always feed my hubby and send him home for a good night sleep after a couple beers!  

when i lived in the suburbs, i tried to find a place like this.  who knew it took moving downtown to find a neighborhood bar?  and BONUS - good food and not crappy bar food we had become accustomed to (paninis, winking lizard, cleats...UGH)

sometimes i just want a place i can go in my sweats and also fancy slacks and a velvet shirt. this is it. 

thanks XYZ - see ya in a couple days!"}
{"text":"NIce place. Comfortable. Service is outstanding. Almost everyone will come to your table to see if all is OK. Draught beer choice is good. Pours are great! Beer to the top of the glass, very little foam. Menu is interesting. They have some different items on the menu  (stuffed cabbage rolls with kraut on a hoagie, country fried chicken with waffles). Menu items are priced competitively,  meaning some will seem like a great deal, some may not. All in all, a nice experience. It is a bit loud as previously mentioned, but no where near what it can be like it can be at a Winking Lizard ( love the Wink!). Worth a try to decide for yourself!"}
{"text":"They have good service, beer selection, and the pizza we got was fantastic. Their spinach dip was more of typical bar food, just alright."}
{"text":"XYZ is great.  First of all, service is EXCELLENT.  Everyone is attentive and works as a team to make sure you have everything you need but they're never pushy  or rude.  Beyond that, the food is great!  My husband and I stopped in on Sunday to catch the Browns game, have a few drinks and hang out somewhere new.  He had the turkey avocado wrap and I had the grilled cheese with bacon.  Mmmm Mmmmm good.  This isn't knock your socks off, inventive food where you have reductions, and glazes and all that kind of stuff.  It's nice, light bistro fare and it's food done right.  Beyond that, they have TVs everywhere so you can watch the game from pretty much anywhere in the place (the patio notwithstanding)."}
{"text":"Every time I come to XYZ, I leave feeling satisfied. Not wowed, but satisfied! I keep coming back because I just love the vibe. It's a great place to kick back and have some brews, watch a game, chill with your buds! 

Most often, I travel to this place to grab Noms, for both brunch and dinner. 

First, brunch. I will say this, they have all the staples. My significant other tried the mimosa ($8) the last time we were there; the champagne was incredibly dry and the freshly squeezed juice was so bitter that I found the drink unpalatable.  Good news is that there's typically not a wait for brunch, although I find the service to move kind of slow. 

Dinner is also A-ok! I've had their sandwiches.... They're pretty good; generous portions. I really love their house made potato chips and their deep fried broccoli. Yessss - tempura battered veggie goodness."}
{"text":"I stopped with a couple of friends for brunch after spin class. Fairly busy around noon but seems like most of the crowd came in earlier. We sat at the bar and the bartender doubled as our waitress, she was really sweet. My friends ordered the Benedict and I ordered the corn beef hash (one of my favorite breakfast dishes). The beef hash comes with poached eggs, and I requested over easy. Our orders come out, and my friends' orders were mixed up but quickly fixed. My eggs were anything but over easy. The center was as dry as can be. I hate complaining but I kindly let someone know that I requested over easy eggs and I would appreciate them remaking the eggs. My dish comes out again about 4 minutes later, the eggs are still dried out. I did not complain again as I felt my feedback was useless. Trying to put aside the eggs, the beef was good and the potatoes are OK. Just too dry overall due to the eggs. The dish would have been much better if someone knew how to make over easy eggs...

Not sure I will return, but if I do it surely won't be for breakfast."}
{"text":"Went for brunch with friends last Sunday.  Service was good.  My friends got the blintzes, which they said were good.  I had French toast which was right sized for brunch.  Service was attentive and the coffee kept coming!"}
{"text":"I came to XYZ on a Sunday night after work. I've been here before as well. The space is open and had ample seating for the Sunday night crowd. Our server was incredibly vigilant, refilling waters and looking out for us throughout our time at XYZ.

We shared the tempura broccoli, a delicious and filling dish with plenty to go around, and the caprese bruschetta, which also was quite satisfying. The flavors of the dishes were fantastic, and they were delivered hot and with flair (XYZ written in some eel sauce on the tempura plate was cute.). 

I will absolutely return here for another try. XYZ is fantastic."}
{"text":"A whiskey bar with smoked meats.... Need I say more? I think the Cleveland Cheese Steak is everyone's favorite and for a good reason. If you are going to go, go on Wednesdays. $10 for the cheesesteak and a beer, CANT BEAT THAT. 

Good luck eaters
SL"}
{"text":"One of the best spots to get chicken and waffles. Casual with hints of upscale vibes kinda ambiance. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've visited this local watering hole multiple times with my best friends, that live in the neighborhood,  but tonight the pizza was extraordinarily delicious. The shot and beer combination specials always bring a smile to my face. they are hand selected by the staff...Kudos Xyz for a fantastic bar atmosphere in an up and coming neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This place is solid. You can believe most of the reviews. Fun, good food, good service, easy parking with a big parking lot behind and and and....

But.... don't believe the other pizza reviews, they do not have the best New York Style Pizza in Cleveland. Yes it's a good pizza. Yes it's relatively thin crust. It's solid pizza. Great late night or anytime pizza. Just not really great New York style. Too much cheese, the wrong kind of cheese, crust a little too thick and cooked at too low of a temperature. I'm not a huge fan of the slightly too sweet sauce either, but that's personal preference.  

So come and visit. Have a good time. The tempura broccoli ap is a great taste with delightful dipping sauces. (Its huge, enough easily for 4) and lots of other great choices."}
{"text":"We tend to go here after showings at the Capitol just down the street. The drinks are good and we've always had really friendly and fun servers. 

Initially we were expecting it to be a pizzeria, and while they do serve pizza, they are definitely more of a barbecue joint. 

Our first experience there we ordered a pizza to share since they were having a special, something like $10 for a large pizza. It was ok. Despite clearly being freshly made the cheese was kind of rubbery and had a sort of middle school cafeteria quality to it.

The last time we went I ordered the pulled pork, which was good but was too large for me to finish by myself. My partner got some kind of cheesesteak sandwich that he said was good, but wasn't what he was used to (and, in fairness, he *is* a Philadelphia native). 

So all in all XYZ is a place with serviceable food, a nice bar, and a super nice staff. If you're in the area I certainly wouldn't tell you to avoid it."}
{"text":"Yes, I'll have a whiskey on the rocks, please. This place has an extensive list of whiskey, scotch, all your hard liquor selection. So if you're looking for a drink that would give you a quick buzz, come to this place. It's in Gordon Square so it's a nice place to go if you want to be a place that's low key. They do have outside sitting and they tend to open their doors as well. Bathroom area - chalk board so feel free to write or draw whatever. I like that idea because it kinda reminds me like Tremont Taphouse but a much bigger wall lol. 

Anyhow, this place is a full bar so order whatever you want but this place is known for the hard liquor stuff. All my friends I was with ordered some sort of whiskey so we were all just hanging out and there isn't really a crowd so don't worry, you don't have to scream across the room."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Went here after a bad experience at cha pizza. Worked up an appetite again and had their burger. This is how a burger is supposed to be. Wine was served in normal glasses and not juice glasses. It felt like I went from romper room to the adult leagues by going over here from there."}
{"text":"2nd time visiting XYZ; 1st time, pizza with friends, zero expectations,
pizza was good, atmosphere ok for a night out with friends - so they delivered. This time, came in for an appetizer and lunch.. Artichoke spinach dip was pretty good .. The ribs.. Not so much. They were dry, no meat and the sauce was served cold on the side. I would come back here for pizza, they have an average selection of tap handles, but definitely not for anything more than that. We sat at the bar, service wasn't bad. Overall experience was good - not great."}
{"text":"XYZ knows how to do it right. The wait staff is extremely attentive and friendly. You will never run out of anything! They have a great selection of beer and whiskey (if you're into that). I really think the Detroit Shoreway is becoming one of Cleveland's premier hangout neighborhoods and it looks like XYZ is prime to be a staple of that. 

Food to try:
- Broccoli tempura
- XYZ Burger
- Fish Sandwich of the day (been good every time)"}
{"text":"This is some place that I've frequented as of late. It's a great place for late night eats, always has a great beer selection, and has a pretty good selection of whiskey and scotch as well. I've never really taken note of the wine offerings, but I know they do have wine.
Food wise their pizza, fries, BBQ (although I'm not a huge fan of the sauce), and burgers are delicious. They have a lot of options, the mussels aren't bad. But my mainstay is definitely the pizza which you can get whole or by the slice. On Monday it's $10 for a huge pizza whatever toppings you'd like. Happy hour is a slice of pizza and a beer (limited list) for 5 bucks which is great since the slices are huge. 
It gets really busy on the weekends but has a pretty good crowd during the week. It's a great place to watch a game or grab a beer and food. The best kind of neighborhood bar, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Thank goodness we live within walking distance of this place. My boyfriend and I frequent XYZ a few times a month and are never disappointed. The menu is vegan/vegetarian friendly, but also has a wide variety of food for omnivores. Service is good and the alcohol selection is on par. And HELLO, they have a daily gnocchi! 
XYZ is without a doubt one of my favorite places in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places in town to get a delicious late night meal. Staff is always friendly and courteous. They always have interesting daily specials. I have tried a number of items on the menu. The corned beef sandwich is HUGE! Chicken and waffles is delish - it comes with syrup and gravy! Brunch is also outstanding. I had a smoked salmon croissant sandwich to die for here! Yum! My only complaint was how small the mimosas are for the price. All and all can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"This place is open 365 days a year. They are that dedicated to you so you should be dedicated to them.

It's typical of the West 25th fare but in a whole new neighborhood. There are new things to try every day and the beer selection gives variety without having an insane number of options. It's a very low key place and it is quiet even when it is full so it is a great place for a business meeting or date night.

If you haven't traveled this far west yet, do it. If nothing else, check them out on holidays when everybody else is closed."}
{"text":"I need to come back here and try something else on the menu. Last time I was here I got the tofu Caprese wrap and corn chowder. Both were sort of meh. I did have some sort of whiskey that was delicious and I want to come back for whiskey Wednesday. 
I also wish it weren't so drafty in here. 
Not a great first impression but I'll give it another chance. Updates to come!"}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE the XYZ. I am told I am biased because I have a previous relationship with the management and some staff through their various ventures but I don't buy it, XYZ is solid on its own.

XYZ has a fine selection of bourbons and whiskeys...I was fortunate to try a few the other week and was impressed not only by the selection but by the knowledge the staff has around the various offerings. My affinity for a good bourbon has grown since XYZ has opened. 

The food is also excellent. I have tried various items and the menu is constantly changing. The Sun-dried tomato and something the kid soup was great. Hearty and thick the cup was the perfect portion. I tried a bunch of other menu items a couple weeks ago, I don't recall the specifics (not helpful, I know) but I do know that everything I tried was fantastic.

The XYZ is a wonderful addition to the Gordon Square neighborhood and Cleveland as a whole. The food and drink selections are top notch; the staff and proprietors are fantastic...and familiar. All in all, definitely worth your time and money."}
{"text":"If it's brown, drink it down.  If it's clear, then you're drinking the wrong damn thing.  This place has a shitload of whiskey.  That means it's gooooood.

I've been here a number of times, but I also went last wednesday, it wasn't slow, but it wasn't busy either.  I stayed for about 2 hours total.  It was a good time and everyone took care of me quite well (as usual).  I've never had horrible service here.  There's been some mishaps, but they always take care of me and are quite attentive.  

I started out by asking the bartender about some new beers.  He described them, but I wasn't so sure, so he poured me some samples without me even having to ask.  I liked one of them, so I got a full glass.  I also go the burger topped with a giant hunk of mozzarella, and a side of fries.  That was also good.  

I would say the menu represents good bar food, but nothing fancy or wild.  You usually have a couple varieties of sandwiches and burgers, there's a gnocchi of the day, pizza, and various apps and such.  I think there's a couple salads too.  Overall, I like their food except for the gnocchi.  It's Ohio City Pasta gnocchi, which I've never been a a huge fan of.  It stays too gummy when sautéed in a pan.  

XYZ's pizza has a lot of comments, so I'll add my own.  I like the pizza.  It's not the best by any means, but it's above the middle-ground for large-slice, soft-crust pizza.  And the price isn't bad.  I will usually get a slice when I end up at XYZ later in an evening and I have a good craving for carbs with warm and melty cheese.  Pizza at any place seems to be divisive amongst the public, but I think this one beats a few other local shops of similar style.

They usually have like 20 taps running, and a number of bottles.  They have the traditional domestics and imports, and then a ton of great craft brews.  They change out the taps regularly and I can usually find one or two beers that are new to me and not generally available across the whole damn town.  

And the whiskey... well, they have a shitload of it from high end and unique, down to the usual suspect swill.  I love the selection of brown liquor.  I love going there and finding out that they got a new variety and sharing in the excitement of drinking the best thing to come out of humanity's ability to turn sugar into alcohol.  

The jukebox sucks.  Even the employees play their own music rather than the jukebox.  It's not an issue until some random person decides to actually use the stupid thing.  I know everyone's tastes differ and I know that I'll never find my kind of music in a jukebox, but this thing just isn't good.

Overall, XYZ is a place I enjoy.  Good beer, good whiskey, good food, good people."}
{"text":"I really wish this place had lived up to it's predecessor but after two times dining there I can say we will not be returning.  

Let's start with beer. They have an impressive draught beer list. And it's cold and yummy becuase well it's craft beer and really you can't screw it up until you serve it in a plastic solo cup. At a bar. To paying customers. While you serve the table drinking budweiser in pint glasses.

The food is nothing special. Thr burger was there and it was cooked and it was covered in flotsam. Minced red pepper and parsley which served little more purpose than annoying me. The reuben was soggy. The chips were tasty but it's difficult to screw up fried potato slices. 

I hate to wrtie about the bad service as both times I've been we have had the same server but I must say she needs to find a new job as she performed many of the server faux pas as one can in two dinners. Service was slow. Even on an empty night and all the serving staff seemed more interested in socializing than doing their jobs. Add in a server disappearing with your credit card on a busy night for 25 minutes, having to track her down at which point she still has not run the tab. . . well there really is no redemption at that point. Service is not their thing.

This place needs to take a lesson from ABC. They have location and they have beer but the rest needs some work."}
{"text":"XYZ reminds me of the places I really used to like when I was an undergrad at Ohio University many, many years ago. It's a bar with OK food, OK service and a pretty cool vibe. Located in the Gordon Square Arts District of Cleveland, the location is a nice mix of urban renewal and hipster chic. I'm not really sure what that all means other than it seems like a cool place for those in the neighborhood.

The layout is pretty typical with a long bar flanking the right side, TVs hanging overhead, exposed brick tells tales of what used to be, two garage-type doors with glass panels to the left open to a patio for the warmer days, tables in the middle. It was pretty damn cold when we were there. I recommend staying clear of the garage door side of the bar because you can feel the breeze and you'll regret it. I actually kept my coat on the entire time and was comfortable. I dug the music. It was kinda late 80s alternative.

We walked in around 5:30pm on a Thursday and the place was vacant. A bartender greeted us and told us to sit anywhere. As soon as we sat down at our wobbly table a bartender wandered over and sat two waters down in front of us. First, let me say that using plastic water cups is wrong on so many levels. They look cheap, they're flimsy, and do I really need to say anything about landfills on this one? On the other hand, getting waters out first is a nice touch.

The beer list is decent. 24 taps a couple dozen bottles. A blend of macros and well-worn regional micros. You know the drill. I used to be impressed with this type of offering. Unfortunately, I expect it now. I opted for the Crooked Tree IPA from Dark Horse Brewing Co. (Marshall, MI). A very well-balanced IPA with plenty of piney aroma and back of the tongue lingering bitterness. My wife had the Breakfast Stout from Founders (Grand Rapids, MI). A heavy (8.3%ABV) stout with thick coffee and chocolate.

The menu here is relatively small, mostly sandwiches with a few interesting items like Soba noodles and a gnocchi of the day each available with chicken, smoked salmon or tofu. They also have a pizza and a beer special for $5 Mon-Th during happy hour. I found it strange that they only offered smoked salmon as opposed to salmon steaks/fillets. And yes, they've got chicken and waffles. I'm starting to realize that chicken and waffles is to Cleveland as crab cakes are to Baltimore.

Sweet Pea Gnocchi w/Grilled Chicken - A large bowl of green gnocchi tossed in butter with small cubes of carrot. A slice of toasted garlic bread on the side.  I get it, peas and carrots. Very clever. I expected light, fluffy melt in your mouth. I got dense, oily dough balls. They were also quite bland. It was a bit like eating buttered spaghetti. The chicken breast was cooked unevenly with half being burnt and dry and the other moist and tender. C- on this one guys.

Nitro-Battered Fresh Cod Sandwich - Your basic fried fish sandwich, bun, LT, nothing memorable here. Following in the footsteps of the gnocchi, the fish was bland. I don't understand what people have against seasoning the batter they fry things in.   My wife substituted the chips with cole slaw. Big mistake. Yet another cole slaw disappointment - bland, devoid of dressing, belongs on a Panini. For $11 I wanted more.

Our experience at XYZ was average. The food was forgettable, kinda greasy and un-seasoned. I don't think it's a good sign when they give you salt and pepper shakers. It's kinda  like they're saying, \"We're not so good at seasoning our food. How about you give it a shot.\" The service was passably neutral. We were going to try the dessert but we were never offered the choice. She brought us the check before we had a chance. There really wasn't any one thing that would make us want to come back to XYZ. I don't go to bars just to drink anymore but if I did this place might be good for that."}
{"text":"There's one bartender on days whose awesome, but I can't remember his name. The rest of the staff, not so much, unless they know you already,  Pity,because I'm new to the community and looking for a regular place. Looks like this isn't it, except for lunch."}
{"text":"The bartender was super helpful and the food was wonderful. Another reason to visit the Gordon Square neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great eats and local boose. Perfect for an informal meet up with BBQ and a nice brew. The BBQ is perfect and the chips are fresh and crisp. A chill, Spartan  ambiance doesn't distract from good company. On sunny days it is openned up so a nice breeze can pass through."}
{"text":"Omg, I was at a meeting for work down the street, and we decided to walk to xyz for lunch. I've never heard of this place, but I wish i had before yesterday. My lunch was just fucking perfect!!! It was perfectly cooked and just delicious!! Service was good, the atmosphere was great! Great prices as well! Couldn't ask for better! I really enjoyed my experience!"}
{"text":"While I'm still pondering the name of this place (Are we going to confuse it with XYZ The Discount Tire Shop?), I'm really glad I tried it.

PROS: Some of the best brisket I've had in Cleveland. Really wonderful.

CONS: Our server, whose shift apparently ended before our meal did.
Water served in clear plastic cups, like the kind you get near punch bowls at school parties.
The difficulty getting said clear plastic cup refilled when needed.

But, oh, the brisket! Great enough to go back regardless of the negative. Delicious enough to want to explore other menu offerings.

My friend said his cheesesteak was very good too. A little too spicy, but very good."}
{"text":"This place was a nice find on yelp appreciate the reviews on this place and concur it's very good food i had pizza awesome and the St. Louis ribs and the BBQ sauce was excellent and the broccoli tempura tasty would highly recommend a try being from out of town I'm always Game to try something new very happy I came"}
{"text":"Finally got back to try the pizza after not having any pizza for months... Ohmygah, I was like a starved wolf. A huge XYZ pie was just the ticket! 

For $14 bucks you get a pie x3 larger than your face. It's thin (thank god) with a chewy crust and lots of melty cheese. They serve it up pipping hot with grated parmesan cheese and crusted red pepper flakes. It was delicious and everything I wanted in a slice. Even better, since there was only two of us we had leftovers and it was still good heated up the next day!

The bartender from Boston who served us was also really nice. We ordered two side salads with our pie and he forgot. Once he remembered we were pretty much stuffed, so he boxed them up togo and took them both off our bill. 


Double-bonus? Even though it was after brunch I could still order a mimosa with fresh OJ. Free parking, great beer list, awesome brunch, cheap, huge pizzas--get on it."}
{"text":"I'd heard a lot of good things about this place. Most of them seem to be true as the service was good. Atmosphere was pleasant. I ordered the veggie omelet that came with a side of potatoes. I'm not a huge fan of potatoes but these were seasoned well and had some onions. The omelet was fine - better than your chain breakfast restaurants but not extraordinary. I enjoy being in the Detroit Shoreway neighborhood and will probably return here at some point. It just didn't leave a strong enough impression to become one of my favorite brunch spots in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The most consistent restaurant and bar in town! Good food and good people! I looove the broccoli tempura, but everything is delicious. Whenever I come home this is always the first stop on my list! The beer selection is phenomenal, even if your not a beer drinker they have beer ciders and a full bar."}
{"text":"Nothing on the menu looked very good to 3 out of party of 5. So we just all kinda settled on whatever we think we may like most. Surprisingly, the Cleveland Philly was the only thing worth while here and jesus those prices are ghastly."}
{"text":"This is my favorite weekend brunch place. My wife & I go often and it never disappoints. Standout items are the corned beef hash and the chicken & waffles. Typically can get a table with no problem, but it does start to get busy around 11am. Plenty of parking in rear of restaurant."}
{"text":"I've had a wide variety of experiences here ranging from great to bad, thus the 3 star review. Some of the food items I've had were great (Walleye Reuben & Broccoli Tempura) and others not so much, including their pizza by the slice and soba noodles. It's an interesting, smaller space which tends to get busy during dinner and late night. They run some good food specials and cheaper beer/shot specials for happy hour, but the lack of consistency with the service here is the biggest detractor for me."}
{"text":"The tempura broccoli is awesome!!! The picture is only half of the serving.  You can easily have it as your meal.  They also had a great selection of beers.  We got there later on a Friday and they were packed so we sat at the bar.  They were out of the noodles which was okay.  We got the the tofu  and a side of cole slaw wrap instead.  It's was good and I took half home and it heated up well. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood. Checked out XYZ. We had the buffalo shrimp which was quite good. The fried fish sandwich was also damn good. but... the fried chicken and waffles were pretty much a bummer. first off, why fry breasts when you can use thighs? so dry... and the waffles were cooked well but the batter was highly uninteresting which made them kinda tasteless. i hear the Scene raved about this dish, but i don't get it. Great beer selection. Nice folks."}
{"text":"Are you a fan of ABC the Tavern?  How can you not be, right?  Well, you undoubtedly will become an even bigger fan of ABC's sister bar, XYZ the Tavern, upon your first visit - I know I did.

Conveniently located right next to the Cleveland Public Theatre on West 65th and Detroit, XYZ is bound to be everyone's new favorite neighborhood bar, even if they're not from the Detroit Shoreway.

With approximately 25 craft beers on tap, XYZ is a beer snob's dream come true. Whiskey lovers will be ecstatic when they peruse the selection of single malts, Irish, and rye - as well as the bourbon and scotch.  For the wine enthusiast, there are some nice options as well.

The bar is warm and inviting and the servers are eager to help - while at the soft opening (which was packed) I was very impressed with the bartenders' ability to quickly acknowledge and complete the customers' requests.  It was as if the bar had been open for years - the bar was operating seamlessly and it hadn't even opened officially!

XYZ also offers an eclectic food menu. We sampled an array of appetizers, like: hummus & pita, mini corn beef sandwiches, chicken & waffles, bruschetta and crostini.  All were delicious - fitting of a bar yet slightly unexpected.

With all of this said - I am already looking forward to returning next weekend.  An absolutely wonderful addition to the Detroit Shoreway neighborhood."}
{"text":"XYZ really hit the spot!  A phenomenal beer list, great pulled pork BBQ, and a relaxed atmosphere.  We sat on the patio, kicked back, and had a great time socializing.  The pork belly cheese grits were delicious and a real surprise to find in Ohio.  If you're looking for an excellent place to hang out with friends over dinner and drinks, this is it."}
{"text":"Great experience at XYZ this week. The staff was awesome: friendly, knowledgable, and helpful. Very impressed by the long list of whiskeys and the smaller, but awesome, beer list. They have all the standard craft beer drafts, but also a couple unique breweries I hadn't heard of before! Food was good (wish they had a couple more vegetarian friendly sandwiches though), and its especially nice that the kitchen is open until 2am. The decor and lighting of the place is very cool. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I have had falafel at so many restaurants throughout Cleveland, and XYZ is by far my favorite! It's the last thing you would think a place like this could nail, but it's seriously so good! Love their brunch too. The staff is also very welcoming and friendly!"}
{"text":"The ribs were fabulous.   But my coworkers got the smoked salmon and said it was not good.  Very dry dry dry.   Maybe overcooked or smoked?"}
{"text":"It's an okay place. Not bad. Went over for a drink after  the Luxe cafe!!( which was so good!!). They have a good beer selection and have some wine as well!
Did not try their food.
But one of the coolest things about this bar was that they had a chalkboard wall so you could graffiti in chalk. 
Would swing by for a drink."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the night we went, maybe it's always this way.

What my friends and I experienced at XYZ was enough to make us not want to hurry home. The vibe of the place is cool, but not too cool.  The service is just right, the staff is pleasant, and the food is surprisingly not like traditional bar food.

It's hard to believe XYZ hasn't been open a whole calendar year yet.  I always expect new places to be chaotic and rough around the edges.  XYZ was easy-going and familiar, as if it had been planted mid-block for ages.

Between the three of us, we ordered Irish coffees, a margarita, the gnocchi special, and tempura broccoli.  We shared everything and were satisfied.  Our bite at XYZ came after seeing a show at CPT and walking around the neighborhood. 

It was late, XYZ welcomed us and kept us happy."}
{"text":"The hubs and I decided to check out this place after hitting up  Mt Carmels Italian Festival which was going on down the street. We were still hungry to say the least. At any rate, we have been to XYZ before but only to drink. We had heard from many friends how great their food is and gave it a go. 

We were not disappointed. I had a slice of pizza with mushrooms, onions and green peppers. Husband had the walleye sandwich. His sandwich looked and tasted great. Breading wasnt to heavy or thick...just right. My pizza was good...I wouldnt say the best Ive ever had but it was good. We are anxious to go back and try other items."}
{"text":"$4 slice of thin crust, quarter pizza. $12 for chicken and waffles. $5 happy hour for a slice and craft beers. Yum!"}
{"text":"Most underrated BBQ in Cleveland. This place doesn't seem like a BBQ joint but don't let them fool you they make some of the best beef brisket you can find in the area. Great bar with a big beer selection and their pizza is good for a slice."}
{"text":"I was hungry late night and I couldn't think of anywhere to go. I stumbled upon xyz and was so impressed. Late night food is almost never decent but xyz was the exception."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the pizza.  14$ for 8 large slices in a large pizza.  They have a few tvs by the bar.  The staff were helpful on a busy evening.  The portions were generous.  There's a small patio with about five tables. If the place is packed the patio tables are bit too far for good game watching."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about XYZ!! After leaving 2 places in the Edgewater area because of terrible service we stopped here. We were greeted within 45 seconds with menus, waters, smiles, and soon to follow a server ready to take our orders!! Thank you all for the excellent service we get every time we come in!! Great beer selection, the falafel wrap is my favorite, and fabulous servers and bartenders!!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect when entering the XYZ tavern.  A lot of places seem to think they're doing you a favor by letting you eat there and for some reason my judgmental self already assumed that's what was going to happen here.  
Boy I was wrong.  While the food was delicious, the service is why it gets five stars.  We walked in late on a Saturday and there was not an empty seat in sight.  Immediately we had at least three bar tenders/servers come over and try to help us out.  We were offered drinks while waited and each bar tender was extremely personable.  Finally two seats opened at the bar and the bar tender held them for us even though there were people all around who could have sat there.  Who does that?  It was a nice touch.
They had a pretty extensive wine and beer list but seeing as I just got off work all I wanted was a glass of wine and to relax so I didn't feel like looking it over to much. 
My friend and I shared the cheesy grits, veggie ratatouille and the roly poly sandwich with fries and gravy.  The grits were a bit salty but delicious and actually complemented the ratatouille perfectly.  By itself it may have been too much...very creamy with cheese and onions.  The roly poly sandwich was filled with stuffed cabbage, sausage and sauerkraut.  The stuffed cabbage filling was lightly seasoned.  Like a light meatball.  It was good but not amazing.  The fries were perfectly salty and crispy.  The gravy was good but I like mine better.
Overall it was a great experience.  Everyone was so inviting, I felt like I was already a regular.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"XYZ is our go to hangout spot. Great tap selection and you can't beat the happy hour deal of a pint and a slice of pizza for $5! Great brunch too. Excellent spot in Gordon Square."}
{"text":"When I heard that XYZ does a thin crust pizza, I went that same day to try it out. Cleveland seems to like a soft pizza crust and this one was at least crispy on the outer part so I was definitely satisfied. A large generous 8 cut pizza was $18 with whatever toppings you'd like (lower cost if you prefer cheese only). I get excited about free pizza toppings the way someone should get excited about free puppies. All the veggie toppings were fresh and the pepperoni had the right amount of spice. My husband said the pizza was \"like a homemade frozen pizza\" which I think he meant as a compliment as he had three slices! 

We also had the tempura broccoli (pictured below) that came out as giant broccoli florets fried in a light tempura batter with a nice chili oil sauce. Hashtag ways to get your man to eat veggies. He was in love. I enjoyed it as well and they seem to have fixed the cooking issue mentioned in other reviews, no runny batter.

The beer selection was about what I expected and my hubby and I both found an IPA to our liking. Service was quick and friendly. The music was on point (late 80s, early 90s). We went embarrassingly early for a Friday dinner (4pm) but it was fairly crowded and we were still able to hear one another talk. I'm also a sucker for exposed brick. Somehow a cold beer just tastes better when I'm looking at a red brick wall.

I will definitely be coming back for the $5 pizza slice and beer special (M-F) and would also love to try the grits."}
{"text":"We were in the area for an event and stopped in to this shot and a beer BBQ joint after reading the good reviews. Thanks fellow yelpers!

XYZ smells of delicious BBQ as you walk in the door. They do all their own smoking with cherry wood on location. The atmosphere is casual industrial and cozy in an old brick building. There are about 24 beer taps with many other available in a bottle or can. The specials for each night are creative combinations of a shot and a beer, like fireball and angry orchard as a classic candy apple. Then there are food specials as well. The food menu is small, but what we tried was fabulous.

We ordered the BBQ special which was a choice of pulled pork, half chicken or half slab ribs served with coleslaw and fries for $10! The serving of pulled pork was generous. It was lean and moist and had a delicious smoke to it. The sauce was served on the side and was one of the best I've ever had. The coleslaw was very lightly dressed, which I appreciated, and the fresh cut fries, good. We also had a separate additional order of fries, a draft beer and a shot and beer special and the bill came to $25. 

We sat at the bar and the staff were attentive and accommodating and helpful with questions offering suggestions and samples of draft beers. The place was clean. There were several televisions with games on. Overall, this was a great place to hang out!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were roaming around the city when we stopped at XYZ Tavern for brunch.  The menu was very straight forward and there wasn't a ton of options.  I ordered the XYZ breakfast, and my boyfriend had the corned beef hash.  The food came out quickly, and everything was delicious!  Another bonus was the bill was reasonably priced.  For the both of us it only cost $15, and the staff was super friendly too!

I definitely recommend this place and will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch with 3 girlfriends.  First time diners. The corned beef hash was phenomenal.  Chicken on the chicken and waffles could use a little more seasoning...the chicken tenders were really bland.  Bloody Mary was delicious.  However, the service could be greatly improved.  I had to get up and get napkins after asking for them three times.  There was no check back after food delivery so I had to go to the wait station to retrieve condiments before the food got cold.  Waitress just placed 4 separate checks on the end of the table instead of presenting them to each   individual diner.  Restaurant also could have used some heat.  We've been waiting 10 minutes to pay so we can leave...."}
{"text":"I had been in here for a beer before, but never tried any food.  The atmosphere is quite noisy--your eardrums will be shattered before the place reaches half capacity--so perhaps I've been subconsciously dissuaded from returning.

An out-of-town guest was visiting me, though and she had a taste for pizza.  Now, I had heard wonderful things about the pizza at XYZ.  I also recalled walking behind a couple ladies on Detroit Ave one day, smelling the pizza they carried in boxes down the street.  Based on those two things alone, I decided we'd give XYZ a shot.  

We placed an order for carryout at the bar, which consisted of a large (full-size) mushroom pizza, a Caesar salad, and a bruschetta salad.  We were told our order would be ready in 20 minutes.  Unable to bear the noise of alcohol-lubricated happy-houring 20-something women wooing it up, we adjourned for a cup of coffee.  

Upon returning 20-minutes later, we received our food and returned home.  Interestingly enough, the pizza was cut into quarters and placed in four small boxes, as the restaurant seemed to be unable to order enough real pizza boxes.  This was but an indication of things to come.  

The Caesar salad looked decent, garnished with crostini, but the dressing had barely a hint of garlic .  Disappointing, to say the least.  The bruschetta salad was okay, with nice fresh basil mixed in with the tomatoes, but I would have certainly expected crostini (you know, the foundation of bruschetta) like the Caesar had. 

The pizza was--to put it kindly--a complete effing disaster.  The crust was charred black, giving the pie a nice, carbony exhaust pipe flavor.  The mushrooms were the salty, gummy, straight-out-of-a-jar variety.  This was the most absolutely disgusting pizza I've ever eaten in Cleveland, and there's no way in hell I'll ever go back.  For one, it's incredibly difficult to burn a pizza.  Two, the asshole cooks know damn well they gave us a burnt pizza, and yet they STILL boxed it up for us.  Has this place no standards?

I can't tell if I'm more embarrassed that I treated an out-of-town guest (from North Jersey, no less) to shambolic pizza, or that I paid $33 for the privilege of getting sick.  I will be steering folks away from this place, and recommending Crust in Tremont instead."}
{"text":"Brunch is soooo delicious!  Mimosas and bloody Mary's and the food is so good with healthy options just for me!  Staff is super friendly and cool laidback atmosphere.  Parking in the back of bar.  Seriously top picks for brunch!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Gordon Square, and I previously considered this to be a pretty good option for cheaper eats in the area. We've gobbled up some pretty decent food here before - one of the first times I had chicken and waffles was at XYZ, and I still remember arguing with my husband because he was the one that ordered it and I was eating too much of his meal. Good food is worth arguing about, right? 

After our last visit, I don't know what to think! Their prices have gone up (the chicken and waffles was definitely not $10.75 last time we had it) and I guess they just decided they were too cool for salt and pepper. I had butternut squash gnocchi which was supposed to be in a brown butter sauce topped with parmesan. The dumplings were chewy and flavorless, and appeared to have just been rolled in some olive oil. No cheese...no nothing. I wanted to ask our waiter if I could get some cheese but he never stopped long enough at our table for me to mention it. My husband also got grits as a side and again, completely bland. Cheese is one of the things I wake up for every day, so the lack of it on my pasta and in the grits seriously bummed me out. My sister ordered their fried broccoli appetizer, which was pretty tasty, although they don't cut up the broccoli stalks at all beforehand so some of the batter between florets doesn't end up getting cooked. 

They offer a lot of drink specials depending on the day. Before 7 on weekdays they have a few draft beers for $3 (when we went it was Rebel IPA, LH Milk Stout and Brooklyn Lager). A pretty good deal for decent beers, but our Brooklyn Lagers tasted a bit off. Like not clean tap lines. Sadness. Anyway, I know this place has potential so I'm not about to give up on it, but my expectations are definitely lower now!"}
{"text":"I've been to XYZ a couple times. I was in this time for brunch with a friend. We got to sit right down, however it took quite a while for a server to come over to us. Our mimosas tasted fine but the glasses were covered in pulp, like they spilled over and didn't bother to wipe them off. The grits I ordered were good, but when I ordered blueberry blintzes I expect to see blueberries. I had one berry in the sauce they gave, which had the consistency of water. Very disappointing, I'll be going somewhere else for brunch from now on."}
{"text":"I'm not so sure I am completely sold on the service strategy of XYZ. Unique yes, but it has plenty of room for flaws..... 

The service concept at XYZ seems to be on a \"share\" basis. As in every server shares you as their customer. Whichever server isn't busy will take your order. The next time around, someone different will refill your drink or put in your food order. Only one issue with this strategy: If multiple people are taking care of the entire dining room and it's busy, a table or request is sure to slip through the memory every now and then, right? Well it happened to us. Drink orders and food orders took too long to be filled. Apparently servers X, Y or Z assumed that server U, V or W had already taken care of us. It all just seems so unorganized and not at all logical to me. 

But besides that, the food, beer and booze selection was definitely above mediocre. The chicken and waffles were the best I've had in town. Much better than the very overrated Deagan's in Lakewood even. Looking forward to heading back to sample the rest of the menu. I'll probably end up sitting at the bar though to avoid the hit-or-miss table service though."}
{"text":"Excellent food, specials & service. This place gets packed at times and can cause a little slower service, but quality and taste of the perfectly prepared food comes out seasoned to perfection & totally worth the wait. Portions are generous, prices are moderate and worthy. Husband and I have visited visited twice and vowed to continue going back. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went in for some drinks after work with a coworker and wasn't expecting anything all that great and left extremely happy!
First of all, the staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable! I love whiskey/bourbon and since they have a huge selection i just played the \"surprise me\" game with the bartenders and they had one yummy pick after another!
aside from the great service, and good drinks, we ordered an order of the mussels which were delicious! 
They definitely just got a new regular customer! :)"}
{"text":"After a night of drinking in Cleveland, my friend took me here to have a bite to eat (and some more to drink!!) Now, please bear with me because I may have had a little too much l Jesus Juice in me, but I will try to remember the details of my visit.

The place itself it nice. Nothing too spectacular, but for a pizza place outside of the city, it's pretty swanky. 

The price you can't complain about. I got the deal in which you get a beer and slice of pizza for $5. Not bad at all! I'm a thick crust kind of guy so I wasn't to fond of the thinness of the crust, but it was still a great slice of pizza for the cost. 

Our waitress was also fabulous. She knew she was dealing with a bunch of drunk people and did a great job handling us. Props!"}
{"text":"Slow service only the bartender and another girl for the whole place.  Food was ok i got a pulled pork and a rueben, and the bland tomato bruschetta ok food nothing to write home about.  Bartender ignored us the whole time i don't think i will be back.  Nice place tho!!"}
{"text":"SO MUCH MEAT. I'm a big fan of all the BBQ options at XYZ, & everything sounds delicious, though I wouldn't really know - all I ever want is chicken & waffles, over & over, forever. 

Their chicken & waffles are admittedly not as creative or upscale as others I've had in the area - it's pretty much just straight-up fried chicken & old-fashioned buttermilk waffles - but I appreciate the simplicity of a meal done right, & this is a good one. It's big, too, so it'll keep you full, & oh, yeah, it's drenched in Ohio maple syrup, so it'll also keep you happy & home-state proud. Also delicious are their ribs, which I've only stolen from my boyfriend's plate, but they seemed pretty damn good. Sorry, I'm mostly a chicken & waffles girl.

Good vibe in this place, too, kind of garage-feeling with a small outdoor seating space & a lot of light but somehow still cozy. The servers are friendly & patient, the prices aren't too high, & the chicken & waffles are delicious. What more could a Clevelander want?"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon and I could not resist a slice of pizza and a beer for $5. It turned out to be a good choice. I liked the pizza. It has a crispy crust and they really load up the toppings. It's also a very large slice of pizza. I was pleasantly full after just one slice. Not that it stopped me from ordering a second slice.

We also tried the bruschetta appetizer, which was quite good. The serve a bowl of the mixed up toppings with a generous portion of toasted crostini. My only complaint is that the mozzarella really needed to be chopped a little more finely. The chunks were large and there were only about 5 or 6 of them, so you could really portion it out well for a couple dozen crackers. Not a big deal, really.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"This was the perfect spot for after work lounging.  from 4-7 a few beer selections are $3; (when I went it was Brooklyn, Left Hand and Sam Adams) from their beer list and a slice of pizza with any amount of toppings was $2.  The slice was huge..its not your average pizza slice, we're talking costco sized.  It was thin and a little too chewy, but the cheese, sauce and toppings gave it a great flavor.  They have cheese, crushed red pepper flakes as well as siriracha sauce for the pizza.  Once slice was just enough to fill me up for dinner, 2 probably would have been overkill.  There is plenty of seating in doors, and they opened up the alley and back for outdoor seating.  

Parking is pretty easy since there is plenty of parking in the (free!) back parking lot!"}
{"text":"People were friendly, food was delish and relatively inexpensive... Cider beer and a slice of great pizza for $9? You can't beat that. Thanks for another great place CLEVELAND!"}
{"text":"Great beer selections, whiskey is flowing! Salmon BLT....what!? It was delish!! Staff was fast, friendly, casual...outside seating...& daily specials!!"}
{"text":"XYZ is an appealing, cool, black-walled bar with a patio to die for, an ample whiskey selection, and some very delectable foodstuffs. The bar is homey and mod, with plenty of seating--perfect big tables for groups. The pizza is a fan favorite and not without its crisp and cheesy merits, but vegetarians would do well to try the falafel wrap, which is one of the best I've ever tasted. No dry mouth or chest boluses here--just textured, savory goodness. There is the expected wide-ranging craft beer selection, but the whiskey selection is the standout with dozens of single malt scotches, bourbons, and ryes to choose from. The servers tends to be brisk, even a tad removed, but they've never been unfriendly. Overall, XYZ is a hip, dark sanctuary. Worth a look particularly for connoisseurs of ol' Mr. John Barleycorn."}
{"text":"Great BBQ Tuesday Nite.. The platter was amazing.  We had ribs, chicken and pulled pork and the fries and slaw were crazy!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at XYZ for the first time today. Food came quickly, was very good and staff were friendly and talkative. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and found  it to be exceptional. The meat was cooked until tender, had just the right amount of smoke and the bbq sauce on the side was nice and tangy with a little heat. Overall this was a great experience-I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"I arrived here on a Friday after a long week at work hungry, tired, and cranky. I left feeling happy, sated, and refreshed (for which my husband was grateful). This place hits a lot of my sweet spots- nice beer selection, friendly atmosphere, and good, affordable food. The menu was difficult to choose from because everything looked good. We started with the mussels in a classic garlicky broth, perfectly prepared. My husband and I both chose specials (entrees change daily). He went with a pulled Cubano pork on mango rice with pico de gallo; it was surprisingly light and refreshing. I had the gnocchi of the day, which was advertised as sweet pea but turned out to be tomato. No matter, as the dish was still delicious and prepared with a creamy bacon sauce. My happy hour beer was a steal at $2.50, and the house wines were $5 during that time. We got out of here for $40 plus tip and felt like we got a great bargain.

The one drawback was noise. It's a wonderful space, but the volume was such that my husband and I practically had to text each other to carry on a conversation. Maybe we're just old.

I will definitely be back, especially when it's warm enough to throw open those big, beautiful garage doors on the side of the building."}
{"text":"This is about my first and last visit to xyz.  I was not prepared for  the the overcooked plate  of perch for lunch. Heavily breaded and cooked to cardboard texture, the perch under the dark brown breading was almost as brown. I never send food back and reorder for fear of retaliation. The fries were the best item on the plate, the slaw OK. The space was cold and needs some TLC. I'm not sure I want to try something else as all three of the plates looked the same. Perch needs a light crust and being thin fillets, should be cooked to a light brown. How did this place get four stars?"}
{"text":"Went for brunch with a friend the other day, and pretty much fell in love again.  I had the corned beef hash, which was phenomenal;  cubed corned beef with halved baby red potatoes and onions kicked off my day very well. The bloody mary we split was heavy on the flavor.  I'm not much of a bloody mary person, but if you are, by all means, drink up.  The accordion music playing in the background, the Sunday football, and the light streaming in through their huge windows sets a mood that's tough to match elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with friends and loved the smoked tofu option for wraps and salads! Came back with the parents for brunch, and the potatos were BOMB. Music was a little loud though, so depending on the strength of your hangover, be prepared."}
{"text":"Nice fun neighborhood bar and tavern.  Prices are great the servers are wonderful."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's always been a great visit. The staff is very friendly and there's a good selection of beverages to try out. During the summer, they have garage doors on the one wall to open up and let a breeze in as well as a patio area to sit out and enjoy. Even during the winter months, this is a nice place to check out if you're exploring Gordon Square. 

Happy hour is fantastic here.  During the weekdays, it runs from 4-7pm and provides a pretty neat deal of a beer and a slice (quarter pizza) for $5.  On Sunday, the happy hour runs all day. If you plans your visits accordingly, you can walk out of there with a full belly and good buzz for decently cheap. 

XYZ also offers a shot and a beer special each night of the week. This specified pairing will cost you $8 and varies depending on the day. The one thing they could improve on is keeping their website in sync. It doesn't advertise the Sunday happy hour, so I didn't realize until I happened to stop in. The shot and beer pairings are also not the same as advertised and the pricing displayed also differs from what you're charged in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food. The service picked up when the girl with the black and white top start attending. They need to make sure the air conditioning is in with it being 90 degrees. All these flies swarming the food was annoying. Glad I asked for air I was dying in here. Anyway nice place see you again soon"}
{"text":"With sister bar ABC over in Ohio City being one of my frequent weekend stops I decided to check this place out when I was in the neighborhood for the Gordon Square Art Festival. To my surprise XYZ was much cleaner and the staff much friendlier than at ABC.
 I ordered a turkey avocado wrap and it was just what I was looking for on a hot day. The home-made chips hit the spot and the beer list left me with plenty to choose from. 
The place was packed because of the art festival but the service did not suffer because of it. Every time we looked up from our plates there was a different waitress making sure we were taken care of. 
I would gladly return on a Whiskey Wednesday or to order the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Thanks to Murray, I had a slice of that pizza, it was large and tasted good, especially for $14. 

On that Wednesday, it was a slow night but the service was very good, my water glass was filled every time I went for it at the end of the night. 

I started off with a left-hand milk stout and then asked for another stout. Our bartender warned me that it was atypically sour, probably what I wouldn't expect, and gave me a small 3oz sample. Thank you for doing that, I gladly changed my mind and would have otherwise been bummed with my first selection. 

In the back, the bathroom walls and doors are covered with chalkboard and yes, chalk is provided for the customers. Since it was slow, the board was untouched though I wonder what's written on the weekends. 

There's about 20-30 taps (slim on the bottle selection), the prices are average for microbrew drafts, $4.50-$7 for most of them, and they're from all over the country. 

My review is probably positively tinted since I had a great time with fellow splinter faction yelpers here...I'll be back. And yes, their jukebox was lame... You would think the hipsters in the neighborhood would have already boycotted here with a jukebox like this."}
{"text":"Excellent place to grab lunch if you're a fan of barbecue. Once we were led here, we seldom ate anywhere else for lunch during our 2 weeks working near here. This is a bar. The menu is somewhat limited, but barbecue is their main course. They are a bit pricey, but not enough to scare us away. Lunch with a soda and tip is an easy $20. Service was good, we always sat at the bar. Portions are big, you won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"Went for an early Saturday breakfast and was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't busy and the food was great! I chose the BLT & A with cheesy grits - great choice with the chipotle aioli. Reasonably priced and I had a Bloody Mary (it had a bit more cocktail sauce taste than I prefer). We'll definitely come back since my boyfriend is eying the Whiskey flight for $20!"}
{"text":"Excellent spinach dip and great flow between the various members of the staff. Always feel comfortable and taken care of."}
{"text":"Yaay!! 4 stars says it, yo. Though I don't get where people are finding the $$ pricing, this place is SO affordable. I had chicken and waffles ($10, whaaat!!), reisling (solid), and a friggin ridiculous blueberry crepe and some zesty coffee. My dad loved his rueben and pale ale. What I am even more excited about is coming back for the brunch and the supposedly New York Style pizza. Another hidden gem. 

Also, we tried sitting outside and the wind blew our water all over the table and the menus were flying all over the place. The staff was SO nice and apologetic, even though it wasn't their fault. Needless to say we sat inside after that, but for a \"tavern,\" it's a pretty cute atmosphere."}
{"text":"It is easy to overlook, but hard to forget-- XYZ is open for brunch on Saturdays and Sundays, opening at 9am.  

I've had breakfast three times and each time has been fantastic-- you need to pay attention to the specials.  The best breakfast I've had anywhere in a long time was a cornmeal pancake daily special with fresh blueberries and some  jalapeno butter.  Really, perfect!

They aren't as crowded as later in the evening, so it isn't too noisy.  The service has mostly been very attentive and fare has been great."}
{"text":"After 2 back to back weekend visits I can say wholeheartedly I really like XYZ.
Great service, friendly and knowledgeable sets the initial tone but the food really seals the deal.
Our first visit with a group of friends had us trying a variety of appetizers. The tempura broccoli crowns were amazing, as were the spinach artichoke dip and bruschetta. We may have ordered one too many starters as we were all pushing it in food but the pulled pork, wallet dinner and walleye tacos, and cheesesteak all were delicious.
On the second visit the chicken and waffles my kids ordered were met with positive reviews and my big zac burger was delicious. 
I can say our only disappointment over the 2 visits was the coleslaw served with the pulled pork and walleye dinners. Ordered by 3 of us we were all in agreement it was dry and lacked flavor but still not enough to ruin our meals. 
a strong solid choice for dining and drinking and hanging out with friends. A nice little patio offered a bit of sunshine when you are craving that outdoors dining experience.
Definitely worth it to pay XYZ a visit."}
{"text":"I've always had a good experience at XYZ.  Their food is inexpensive and delicious!  Sunday my girlfriend and I were looking for a later in the day brunch and this is the spot we've chosen and were super pleased. We had great bar seats, a waitress who was very attentive and food that was super satisfying!"}
{"text":"Saturday brunch at XYZ.  Arrived around 1230pm (brunch on weekends until 2pm). I would highly recommend brunch here if you're brunch priority is an extensive beer (&draft) menu and solid but limited choices.

Ambiance: 5 stars, especially in summer - we are outside, loved the inside-outside concept in the restaurant, the indoor seating also looked comfortable.  I saw a few TVs inside but definitely not a sports bar - it was much more a very millennial hip bar-type scene.

Staff:  friendly and attentive, however it was not that busy and food took ~30 minutes to arrive - and we were hungry!  

Food:  4.5 stars: really solid food, didn't knock-my-socks-off legendary.  As far as brunches go, I prefer more options (see photo of menu for reference).  A few good vegetarian choices, I went for a BLT-A without the B (fried egg, lettuce, tomato, avocado on a croissant - mmm!). 

Prices: 4 stars - it was totally reasonable prices!  Not diner-cheap but definitely not overpriced.  Good portion control where I didn't think I was stuffing myself.  

Next time I am at edgewater beach, I'll definitely consider eating here again."}
{"text":"Update 11/12/15: we still love xyz these many years later. However the pizza now sucks. I don't know what chef there went to the spaghetti-os school of pizza, but now its just nasty. Lay off on the garlic salt guys. Seriously you could kill a vampire elephant with that."}
{"text":"*sigh* We really wanted to love this place, and it's really hard to give them a 3 but, then again, it's really hard to give them more than that. 

Went here last Friday with a semi-large group (I think there were 12 of us). Being that it's a relatively small place, the staff was VERY accommodating to us and were not annoyed with the group size at all. Our waitress was super friendly and was a good sport about a certain member of our group picking on her Blackhawks t-shirt.

The food, honestly, was good but nothing I'll rave about. The buffalo shrimp appetizer was yummy but really nothing more than shrimp with wing sauce on them. I had the cajun chicken sandwich, and again, decent but nothing amazing. The beer list is good, but not as extensive as I'd have thought based on the reviews it's gotten. 

The main gripe I have with XYZ, as Mel has said, is the noise factor. Seriously, people, this place is L-O-U-D! It was everything I could do to hear what those across the table from me were saying - I was trying to lip-read half the time for people further away. There was absolutely NO attempt to dampen the sound in this place at all. Every surface is brick or some other hard surface and I left the place feeling like I'd been at a rock concert. 

Given the serious loud factor, and the fact that the food wasn't outstanding, it's just not a cool enough place to go back to regularly. Sorry XYZ, I was looking forward to another great addition to GSAD, but I don't think we'll be back until AT LEAST the garage doors are open in the summertime to let out some of that noise."}
{"text":"Reasonably price food menu, slightly expensive drink menu. Went with a large group but ended up ordering from the bar. The bartenders were really great and made really great drinks but I still don't know if that should warrant higher prices, especially if you are just ordering something simple like a Jack and Coke. However, the late night food was great and I really enjoyed their fries."}
{"text":"Pretty busy when we first arrived, I work across the street so I decided to come try. Pizza was pretty good, and so was the service. Recommend if you're into going out with friends at night to watch a game."}
{"text":"I was volunteering at Cleveland Public Theatre, decided to head over to XYZ during my dinner break. I sat at the bar, was given the menus and a water pretty quickly. I ordered a beer and a slice of cheese pizza. The pizza slice was HUGE, luckily I was hungry! I thought the service was fine. If I was in the area, I would eat at XYZ again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where they found their bartenders but they are the nicest/most knowledgeable/friendliest people around.

I have never had chicken and waffles before in my life - in fact I thought the idea of it was disgusting but I am a gal who will try anything once - and OMG I will try them again! they are fantastic here! Some of my dishes here is the gnocchi, the French fries with gravy and shockingly even their ceasar salad is crave-able! (can you tell I've been here a few times).

New specials almost everyday - if you are their when their jumbo scallops are on special - get them!

The only down side is that the acoustics are pretty horrible.. so once it gets crowded in there it is pretty loud.

Good place for happy hour! Slice of New York style pizza with a craft beer only $5!"}
{"text":"For my birthday, a group of friends and my wife dined at XYZ per a recommendation from my cousin.  It was tough to find parking in the bitter cold so we had a short walk to get to XYZ.  Once we were inside, we were immediately seated thanks to our reservation.  The place was lively and crowded.

Our drink orders were immediately taken and I tasted some of their craft beers.  I have to say, they were very good.  I also ordered a smoky bourbon, since it was my birthday.  That was very good too!

We ordered steamed mussels with olive oil instead of butter and they were tasty.  We also ordered the deep fried broccoli, which was also very tasty.  So far so good!

Since they smoked their own meats in house, I decided that I had to go with a meat dish for dinner.  I ordered the smoked brisket.  A short while, and many laughs later, our dinners arrived.  My first bite into the brisket was delicious!  It was sliced thinly and was covered in BBQ sauce.  I liked it.  But then I began to detect a flavor in the meat that made it seem not fresh.  Then it got cold really quickly due to being thinly sliced and spread out over the plate.  By the time I was done, I was slightly annoyed by the flavor.  I definitely didn't have the 'I want more' feeling.  I'll not order it again and I doubt I'll order any of the smoked meats.  I think a burger is best probably.

Overall, this place has a great atmosphere and the food was good.  I'd try it again."}
{"text":"The smoked salmon BLT is ridiculously delicious! A must try! And the house-made chips are fantastic! 
The spinach dip left a lot to be desired.
Overall a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"I accidentally ate half of a large pizza with six toppings from here on Dyngus Day.  God, was it good.

I like that they have a price for cheese pizza, and a price for toppings.  No matter how many.  That's the only food I've had from here but keep meaning to go back and try something else.  That chalkboard menu of specials always looks scrumptious.  

I like to go with people that know things about bourbon or whisky and take sips of theirs.  

I like their little alley way patio and really the overall feel of XYZ; especially the cute sign outside. 

I'm gonna go back, fo' sho."}
{"text":"I ordered the blueberry pancakes the wife ordered the blt&a. It was really a great surprise. Everything was hot and fresh 100% pure maple syrup.  Yes it makes a huge difference. As we watched everything that came out of the kitchen I wanted to eat...."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend have been here several times for brunch. It's a nice spot with good food and the atmosphere is nice as well. I like the location because there is plenty to do around the area. It is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Very dissapointed! Went with a group of six people on a Friday night and the bartender came over to our table and let us know that she was one of only a few people in and that it would be difficult to wait on us. I felt like we inconvenienced her for coming in. She also made sure to ask us not to move our seats so she would not screw up our order. However our food was terrible (and cold) and wrong drinks came to our table and we were charged for them. At the point I wanted to get out of the hipster, rude bar that I paid the tab anyways. First and last trip for me and my friends."}
{"text":"Well, last time I wrote something about xyz I said I hadn't had a bad meal yet, and that's still the case. As ever, our food yesterday was pretty good. But...I definitely can't say the same about the service. We started with a produce sticker in our drink, which frankly we were pretty cool about and drank anyway. When the waitress came back after 20 minutes to tell us \"our order was lost in translation\" (ie she forgot to put it in), we were cool about that too. When she did bring the food and it was wrong, we didn't say a thing as she ran back to the kitchen again to get the right order. When my girlfriend was finally getting ready to put the first bite in her mouth and the waitress showed up yet again to whisk her plate away because it was once more the wrong thing, we still didn't complain. And then we never saw her again. Empty drinks the whole time. Part of my order never arrived.  If you're counting that's 4 food errors, plus a foreign object, plus neglect.  So all in all, pretty bad service right? So when we say, verbatim, no anger or attitude \"so, that was pretty rough, is there anything you can do for us?\" what I'm expecting to hear is your first \"I'm sorry\" of the day. Or sure can I buy you a drink since I totally messed up? Or, let me get the manager.  But when your only response is \"I can run your card for the amount on the check\",, THEN, finally, you and I have a damn problem."}
{"text":"What's not to like? But what is there to absolutely love?  Solid brunch and solid happy hour and solid dinner and solid everything.  XYZ is straight up solid.  Probably my favorite in Gordon Square.  More than solid? Sure.  Fantastical experience in my mouth? Whoa whoa slow down there.  It's solid.

Great beer selection which seems to be the norm in successful hipster restaurants in the US.  The house made chips and French onion dip and on point and the perfect start or side.  I had the brisket cheese steak and it was definitely something I'd try to devour again.  The fries were again solid.  

It's a big open room and they do have an outdoor patio.  Garage doors can be opened to bring the out in. All great things.  I just don't know what they do \"best\".  It's all great, and is always a great choice, if I'm in Gordon Square."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming one of my favorite places to go since I have moved a lot closer. The staff is always great. I had two Hop Slams last night. $7.50 a bottle kind of hurts. Luckily they are limited release. The chicken and waffles are good. I would advise customers to steer clear of the pizza. It is alright pizza, just not worth the money. It is good to get away from the crowded bars of Tremont/Ohio City that I used to frequent. I am wondering if in 10-15 years when those places get played out, will the Gordon Square/Shoreway area will be the next big thing. I don't think that will happen. Stranger things have occurred."}
{"text":"Any place I visit for the first time with fellow yelpers always seems better than without them. Case in point: Old Angle, Primo Vino, Prosperity. I probably wouldn't have gone gaga for those places like I did without my peeps. So having a mini Yelp thing made XYZ very fun. Great view of the spanking new streetscape( unlike the Overrated Dog down the street). Solid tap list, cheaper than Tremont. 

Phenomenal pizza! You don't even understand. For 14 bucks we expected a pie the size of a coaster. It was huge, Angelo's- esque in quality and was fun to share among friends. Other reviews say to avoid the za. I don't know, you must have gone on a bad night. Service was good on a slow Wednesday night. Not sure how they fare on the weekend.

 Weakest point was the juke. Horrific. For a place so fresh and modern, the jukebox seemed like it had been bought from an old man bar. Or even worse, a college town. It was slim pickings if you didn't feel like hearing the Eagles or Willie Nelson. Parking was ample and close. You lose again, Tremont."}
{"text":"A fairly small brunch menu and not many items that perked my interest. The meat lover's omelet was good however. In fact the egg was good perfectly all over. The service was friendly and gave me everything I needed even though the place was a little busy for the Brown's game. As Matthew M. has pointed out the service concept seems to be one of sharing. I think this worked well however. I was never left waiting for anything I needed and was checked on a good amount of times. The patio looks like it could be an inviting spot in the sumer - I was disappointed they didn't open it today actually. All in all a good experience and I wouldn't protest if someone suggested we go here for brunch again, but I don't think I'll add it to my list of places to return to.....it just didn't have the special thing to it. But if you are looking for a brunch better than one of the national / regional chains this place definitely qualifies."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch - amazing bloody Mary's and great eggs benedict.   Loved so many things on the menu and can't wait to be back.  Wish the back door was open, but saw some people coming in through the side, so we must just not be in the know!"}
{"text":"Went here for a Sunday brunch a couple weeks ago and couldn't have been happier. 

It was cold enough that sitting outside was not an option and they were full when we walked in, but we had 8 people and our wait wasn't more than 15 minutes. After eating there I would wait any amount of time for the food.

Vibe was very young and hip, but the crowd was from all age groups and it worked very well. I was with my 60 year old parents and they loved it.

Service was great, especially for a party of eight. Only thing we had an issue with was the fact that we never found out the specials of the day. When we walked in we saw someone with steak and eggs, but couldn't find it on the menu. We almost gave up hope, but decided to ask about it and I am glad we did because it was amazing. 

Our table had 3 orders of the chicken and waffles, 2 orders of steak and eggs, 1 eggs Benedict, 1 French toast and 1 blintzes. Everyone was very happy with their order and what little I tried of other orders, I really don't know what I'll get when I go back because its all so great!!

Can't wait to go back and try this place again! Definitely in my repo-tore of places to eat in the area!!"}
{"text":"Saturday brunch was amazing. We had mimosas along with Eggs Benedict and chicken & waffles. Everything was fairly priced, tasted great and the service was on point to boot."}
{"text":"My girlfriend was looking for a fun place to have dinner.  She saw this XYZ the Tavern on Yelp and checked out their reviews.  One of the reviews mentioned the $5 pizza and beer for happy hour so we decided to give it a shot. 

The pizza was amazing.  I ordered a pepperoni and mushroom slice (the slice is equivalent to 1/4 of a thin crust pizza).  I would totally come back here again on the future.  We had a lot of fun, the food was good, the beer was good, and the bill was cheap! Definitely give it a shot if you want a fun meal without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Good service, and $5 for a large NY style slice of pizza and beer is a pretty damn good deal.  Note: that happy hour deal is only for 2 or 3 of the beers on draft."}
{"text":"I dont know what I put last time for this place, but I love it. Its within walking distance of my house. Never want a DUI, worst ever seems like.

Good beer selection, cool staff, foe the most part. As far as ive had, foods good, so far. Bartenders are cool as hell, im just optimistic about Gordon Square. My latest review on Gypsy says it all. I see this neighborhood coming up, fast. 

Although, I just had a convo with two guys, one looking like Sloth from \"The Goonies\", one of my favorite movies btw. He was telling me I should try XTC and Viagra mixed. He said its called,\"SeXTC\". Wtf is this world coming to? I took him for a square and hea telling me he loves acid and mixtures of drugs, so freely. I dont know what to say. This had nothing to do with XYZ. ITS AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO COME AND RELAX! Theres just things we cant stop and its people like this showing up wherever they want. 

Oh well..."}
{"text":"\"Meh\"

I'm a frequent visitor at ABC and finally was able to sample the other end of the alphabet.  Now, granted, I've been happy with a pizza I'd gotten there before (see below for Carl A's review) and with my eggs Benedict for Sunday brunch.

Alas, their regular menu just doesn't impress.  I'm always thrilled with the options and taste at ABC, so that's what I was expecting...with maybe a little jolt.  I would actually say that ABC blows XYZ away AND it's cheaper.

We ordered the fish, the chicken and the special of the day: sweet potato gnocchi.  Overall, the fish and the chicken were fine, but the gnocchi was probably the worst I've ever had.  I'm a gnocchi fan too!  It was chewy and dense, plus the Parmesan butter sauce gave it a very close resemblance to dog food.  (My mom actually had worse things to say than dog food)

So 2/3 isn't bad...but the two meals weren't blow away awesome either.  It was just a regular ol' sandwich!  Will I eat there again?  Probably not unless I'm drunk after Dyngus day and want to share a whole pizza with Carl A again."}
{"text":"XYZ gave me faith in Cleveland, and being from Pittsburgh, that's saying a lot!  Let me just start by saying they have Chicken and Waffles on the menu.  For me, I think that's a fairly good indicator of good things to come.

I joined my hip cousin, her new boyfriend, and my mom for Sunday Brunch.  We started off with a Mango Mimosa - yum!  Champagne with fresh mango included.  At 6 bucks a glass, it's a little steep, but it was oh so tasty.

We had so many great options to chose from, that we had to ask our server to come back twice.  I settled on the BLT&A (T&A - the 12 year old boy in me giggles).  So, it's a BLT with avocado and fried egg, and was served with cheese grits.  A perfect meal for a Sunday afternoon!  I gobbled it up while perusing their beer menu - I think they have almost 20 beers on draft.

XYZ is in a hip part of Cleveland and an area I'd like to explore more on my trip back.  They have an emphasis on local ingredients, including a daily gnocchi dish with fresh local pasta.  The staff is super-friendly, too - an added bonus!"}
{"text":"Back in the day, I really liked ABC. I still really like their food. It's just too chaotic for me usually. I used to live on the East Side... and never really understood how reluctant East Siders are to cross the river. Several years ago, W25th was a stretch. I moved downtown - just west of the river (literally - the river is my front \"yard\") and I have begun to understand why people use highways and venture all over the Greater CLE area when they live on the West Side. Ok... you might be asking where I am going with this... 

Even though I loved ABC... XYZ seemed like a long haul (again, I realize the errors in my ways) several years ago when it opened. Even though... its what? A half-mile further? Ok, ok... 

I finally ventured to XYZ for the first time this summer... expecting to experience the same ABC environment. Wrong. The food is equally foody and amazing.... but the environment is so much more sophisticated, and so much less... dive bar. 

The patio in the summer is incredible. And, this place has carry out pizza. burgers are good. The salmon BLT is delish. Even the fries are tasty. 

You're certain to run into interesting individuals here whom you can easily strike up conversations with at the bar or at another table. Friendly vibe, no crazy packed space. I like the end of the alphabet a little better these days..."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles were great! Was served hot, crispy, the maple syrup is the real deal. 

My friend loved the corned beef hash. 

Downside - they sat our group next to the door on a -9 deg day. Recommend they put up a half fabric curtain to keep the cold draft contained"}
{"text":"I had the chicken & waffles which were just perfect. The seasoning in the chicken breading was so good and went perfectly with everything.

The $5 beer and a pizza slice happy hour deal is great."}
