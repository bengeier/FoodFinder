{"text":"Horrible service all around. Took 15 mins for someone to ask us for drinks, lots of tables where not cleared. It wasn't even busy- they def need more staff. We finally get our drinks and order in and takes even longer to get our food. I was not impress with the food at all. This isn't Mexican food, just a poor tasteless interpretation. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent fine tasting and savory great food. Good service and outstanding authentic Mexican food.  The rice and beans are seasoned and served to perfection.  One of my favorite Mexican restaurants of all time."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food!  Have been here a few times and never disappointed.  Don't forget to bring cash instead of using a credit card to help this local business."}
{"text":"Great food. Great staff. I actually set up a yelp account just to write this review. Awsome."}
{"text":"Growing up in Globe and now living in the valley I love having Xaviers Casa Reynoso close to home and the new location is much better.  The food is outstanding, but service was slow, but still worth the wait."}
{"text":"The service was very polite and friendly.   I was visiting from Spokane and dropped in.  What a surprise !!!! The food was great with wonderful flavor.   Would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Love Love Love Casa.  Sonoran Mexican food at it's best!  The tacos are to die for and the beans are well, the beat beans you'll ever try! The tortillas are fresh and you can tell they're homemade. The enchilada sauce is something of its own with delicious flavor and just the right amount of spice. The green chili is amazing and the salsa too. Everything is fresh and made to order and the service is great. Definitely give Casa a try, your stomach will thank you!"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome Globe, AZ inspired Mexican food. It's not as fancy as a corporate joint but the food there in delicious. And they always have country music on. Which I appreciate! Order the #1 combo. Tamales are great"}
{"text":"Edit/Update:  They have moved/upgraded/expanded!  The food is consistent through the whole day now as well!!    4 stars changed to 5!!

This is my favorite mexican food place ever!!  I rated a 4 because its only good in the day time. After about 4pm it seems it been sitting too long, otherwose id probably eat there way too much.  The xaviers special burrito is amazing as well as their salsa.  Id def recommend xaviers to anyone looking for good mexican food.  My only suggestions would be to upgrade appliances, remodel, expand and open on sundays!"}
{"text":"I especially love the Chile rellenos. Everything is delicious here and the atmosphere is relaxed, clean and casual. The restaurant moved from Val Vista and Southern East to Higley."}
{"text":"If you want some great Mexican food eat here.  It's a family ran Bussines and they are all really nice. I usually get the butter bean burrito with a side of rice.  All around good place to go."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service. Try the green chili enchiladas.  Service was fast and friendly. Great family atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good food. \"Couldn't care less about you\" service which has gotten WAY worse since the move to their newer, \"fancier\" location.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Casa Reynoso is definitely nothing fancy, but the food is good and consistently so! I've eaten there about a dozen times and each time has been great. The service isn't great, but it is more of a hole-in-the-wall so I don't expect much. The servers aren't overly cheesy and trying to win a tip. They simply take your order, and bring you good food, followed by the check. That's it. It's usually busy, but I've never had to wait to sit down. The complimentary chips and salsa are great too!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Everything is excellent.  The burros are burros.....not burritos. Burritos belong to those poor folks that believe taco bell is Mexican food.
The tacos are mucho bueno and I live for them. Not the pathetic street tacos. Of course, I was raised in the Globe/Miami area and may be a little biased....NOT! I know good Mexican food and this is it. Period."}
{"text":"Tried this place because of Yelp reviews and less than a mile away. The waitress went out of her way to tell us what the \"favorites\" were and she was spot on. The food came out within 5 minutes and was delicious. The Gollo burro is terrific. The prices are very reasonable. I highly recommend this place and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"this is true Arizona old school Mexican food!!!! there is a reason this family has 10 plus restaurants across AZ and still in Business!!! the green chili is good and the cheese crisps are the best around!!!! the salsa is mild and has a great taste!!! the burros are made with another local tortilla company and delivered fresh daily!!!! I am there enough that I have seen the delivery truck on a daily basis and always stop at the other locations this family has in Globe, Safford, Miami and anywhere I have traveled.... highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food. Globe/Miami transplant.  Red chili and green chili con carne are excellent.  Great tacos just to name a couple of items. Regular long time customer."}
{"text":"First time, ordered from the internet menu, number 5 combination. $6.75 per the menu, when I arrived the woman behind the bar told me I didn't order here. Haha. I said ok.? She said you ordered from the wrong Xavier. I said, I'm sorry I think your mistaken. The gal next to her said, I took the order, here it is. Then she said 11.50, i said i thought it was 6.75. No no, She said oh, sorry. I thought ok, no big deal the food will be great. I was sitting waiting for my order, and she asked me if I wanted salsa with it. I said sure, and it comes with a side of chips right? She said no. I was shocked, but since I was sitting waiting for my order I asked her for a side of chips, she got upset and told me normaly they don't do that. I said what? I'm a paying customer, I ordered lunch that was twice as expensive, and I can't get chips? Haha. So I walk back to my work from my lunch break and open the box, not one shred of cheese on the taco, the mixed burrito beef and chicken, was only beans and liquid, and the cheese enchilada was a pile of onions. I called and spoke to Xavier, and he told me he would refund my money. Great first experience, do yourself and favor and don't make the same bad choice I did, don't even try them. Also someone needs to tell the young attractive brunette behind the bar, No matter how good looking you are, you are one ugly bit\"&* the way you treat people."}
{"text":"Super delicious! I will definitely be back. Our food came quickly, and our server was really nice and helpful. Their taco shells are made on premises- no preformed shells! A new \"Go-to\" place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here AT LEAST once a week if not more. The customer service is incredible. The staff is so kind & friendly. The food is sooooooo good, always so fresh and tasty. I cannot say enough positive things about Xavier's, we are addicted!!"}
{"text":"Truly the best Mexican food available in the Phoenix Metro area!  This little town Globe had it all right when it comes to amazing Mexican food!  According to the story on their menu, I'm so happy they moved to Mesa, AZ to share all of this goodness!  Will definitely be back when in AZ!"}
{"text":"I used to really like this place but it seems the quality has dropped off. I picked up a to go order today and it reminded me why I had not eaten their food in almost a year."}
{"text":"This place has now moved locations to Higley/Southern, right next to our house :) The new establishment is very well put together and the food and service are still excellent. We eat here at least once a week. One improvement, some days the chips taste a bit stale. All in all I still give Xaviers 5 stars."}
{"text":"I'm from Globe-Miami, the capital of Mexican food...so I grew up eating this family's food. So excited to move back to Mesa and have Xaviers in my backyard. I recommend starting your meal with a cheese crisp!"}
{"text":"Its ok. This place has a unique flavor. Origanely from Miami-Globe area, they have expanded down here in the valley. They have a strong following. I have eaten here about 10 times, cause of location."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for home style Mexican!  Love the green chili burrito (get it 'smothered' enchilada style) and the machaca tacos!  My daughter who is 4 is a die hard bean burrito fan!  When we are at Mexican restaurants she will ask the server if they make the beans like Xavier!"}
{"text":"Best tamales i have ever had! Had a combo plate w/ rice and beans and everything was good. They are a little pricey for Mexican food i think. No daily specials or happy hour. They do not have a full bar but have good margaritas: ) definitely my favorite Mexican joint around!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food in the Valley!  The green chili is amazing! The staff and owners are friendly and the atmosphere is great. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food was very good but the place lacked any atmosphere and was expensive. There were also a couple of up-charges on the bill that they didn't tell us about (I.e. $2 for extra sour cream!). They also didn't have draft beers and bottles were expensive ($4.50 I think). 

For as expensive as the place was, there should be a decent atmosphere and ambiance. It felt like a carry-out with a few tables for eat-in. 

Although the food was good, it wasn't enough to overcome the other shortcomings. For 3 adults and a child, $72 (including a tip) is way too much. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food!  I love there chips and Salsa and Bean and Cheese Burrito enchilada style.  One of my \"go to\" places in Mesa! Very reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"So we waited but only 15 minutes.  Sat down and promptly ordered drinks and food.  The drinks came and shortly thereafter the food, Machaca Chimichanga with guacamole and received beans. Delicious, as always! Server was very attentive and the experience was great! We will be back again soon. :)"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this restaurant quite by accident, we were in the mood for Mexican food, and had been driving for over an hour. We were bordering on irritation and about ready to give up we drive past Reynoso, looked at each other and said what the hay, we will try it.  We are so glad we did.  The service was good, Food came almost before we had ordered it, I had the combo # 8 the red burrito, enchilada, and chili rellano, was so good."}
{"text":"The food here is simply amazing! I am a huge Mexican food lover and this food taste really authentic. Reminds me of eating Mexican food in Globe AZ, which is where I think the owners of this restaurant is from. I got the Casa Reynosa burru and it tasted so good, I would definitely get that again and again. 

The only one bad thing I could say about this place is that they definitely need more staff in there! Seating took a little bit but other than that the food came out in a timely manner and our waitress was friendly."}
{"text":"Authentic food served HOT! The awesome, friendly service from our waitress was an added bonus, too. Wife and I had some family in town, took them there as its close to home and we all thoroughly enjoyed our lunch in a quiet, spacious setting. The menu is a little bit different with fewer options than your typical Mexican restaurant, but the burros are fantastic! Love getting them Xavier's way. We'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Xavier's. I am so picky about Mexican food.. I want it to be authentic. They have the best salsa and enchilada sauce at Xavier's. In fact, I will go in and just buy salsa about twice a month. The staff are always friendly and efficient with their orders. I have been going to Xavier's for about 4 years now (since before they moved to their current location) and I've never had a bad experience. If they move again, I will follow them again!"}
{"text":"First time there but definitely not the last. Read the reviews and thought we would give it a try. The food was delicious. I had the combo of relleno and enchilada and my hubby had the signature burro. We loved the food. The refrained beans were out of this world, rice was very good, and everything else was exceptional. 

The place is not fancy but with good food you don't need anything fancy. It's in a strip shopping center. Definitely worth a second & third & fourth, etc. trip"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here and went inside. We were greeted right away by a hostess/waitress that said there would be a 10 or 5 minute wait. We waited and saw 3 empty tables and finally after time passed we got up and left. No idea if the food is good we didn't get that far."}
{"text":"The service was great and the atmosphere was nice. But the food was so plain. The entire time we were eating I just kept thinking I could have made it better at home. There was nothing gross about the food, it was just plain. Not a lot of variety on salsa either."}
{"text":"New location Rocks. It's very nice and new. Nice move!  Had #5 great tasting. Fair prices. Go before the snowbirds get back."}
{"text":"My favorite authentic Mexican food around. It's New Mexico style so lots of amazing green chili options but you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I love the shredded beef tacos and the bean dip is amazing. I'm very picky about rice and theirs is definitely my favorite. Always our go-to!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice in the past week, once at lunch and once at dinner. Xavier's continues the rich taste tradition of the Globe-Superior area with their selections. 

One does not go there for the decor; one goes there for the taste and quality of the food, and that quality is outstanding. They are confident of all of their menu selections, and so am I. 

This will be where we go for our weekly Mexican food fix."}
{"text":"We decided to go to this restaurant one more time, first time was a disappointment. I believe in giving second chances. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed in many ways. It may be bad management. We came in t he door, many people were waiting inside and out. The hostess (I call her that loosely) took our name and said it will be 20 to 25 minutes. Asking as if she would like us to say no that is too long and leave. We deceived to wait it out. 

As we waited and more and more people came in the door, she told them the  same thing. The waiting crowd got larger. The dinning room was nearly emply with dirty talbes needing to be clearned. The hostess just stood at her post. One of the waiting customers commented :\" you have more people waiting then you have seated\". The hostess said \"I was told lnot to seat anyone.\" 

The waiting crowd was growning and getting a very agitated , including us.......finally we got seated about 45 min after we came in. Waitress waited on us quickly and our food came  out quickly. I ordered the taco salad,mediocore at best. It was delivered with no dressing, some cheese sprinkle on top not avacao or tomatoes, it was not that good.

I will not be back, too many other good restaurants to go to with better service and much better food. I have no idea why this place gets four starts. I would not send anyone I know to this place.

The hostess acted as if she did not even want to be there. He overheard the couple next to us, the wife said we are never coming back here"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food at long last.  I finally found a place that offers good, fresh, appetizing, Mexican food (though admittedly slightly Americanized).  Give them a try you can't do much better unless you drive all the way to Phoenix or Scottsdale.

My experience has been a little inconsistent so far.  One visit exceeded my expectations and served up a beautiful enchilada/tacos combo that seemed homemade and delicious.  Everything was great, from the awesome red sauce right down to the corn taco shell and spiced beef filling.

My second visit ordering a chilies rellenos was disappointing, I definitely can't recommend it.  Soggy and tasteless with a sparse (thankfully cuz it's gross) cheese for filling.

My husband orders from here all the time when he is working, he has absolutely nothing negative to say about it at all.  Hopefully my last experience was just a one time thing."}
{"text":"Love how the salsa is hot, the items are made to order, and the chips are freshly made. OMFG - cant wait to see their new location. Only complaint is that they close at 9 and their chicken tastes like rotisserie chicken."}
{"text":"If you want the real thing, take the time to actually drive to Miami/Globe. This place is nothing like the food you get in Miami/Globe and just because they are extended family doesn't mean that you are getting same quality of food. While service was friendly, the food was not worth a first trip. Tostada was soggy and dripped liquid, they charge for chips that come in a bowl no bigger than the salsa bowl, and cleanliness was questionable. I truly do not like to write bad reviews, and generally don't. But there are so many better choices for both quality and value.  If you want Miami/Globe style, then take time to drive there. No extension comes close."}
{"text":"If your not a fan of fresh salsa, savory enchilada sauces and a kiss of fresh melted butter on your burro but rather you get excited for those preservative rich strait from the can joints with an army of microwaves in the kitchen to make your food, well then you'll hate this place."}
{"text":"Utterly disappointing...
From the lackluster greeting, to the underwhelming food and service, this place is one star all the way for me.

My mother and I were seated and waited about ten minutes in this mostly empty restaurant before even having our drink order taken. For food I ordered a Red Beef and Green Chili burrito, my mother had a chicken chimichanga.

I'll give them this, the food arrived hot! So hot in fact that it was  untouchable for at least 5 minutes. Glad I didn't take a bite right away, I rather like having taste buds and would prefer not to sear them off.

My burrito was watery, underfilled, and totally underseasoned. It was as if they filled a tortilla with bland beef stew. My mother said that the chicken chimichanga would have been passible if the chicken wasn't so dry, however her dish didn't even come with everything it was supposed to have... Had the waitress cared enough to ask how the meal was or if we needed anything I probably would have spoken up, but sadly the service was less than stellar as well. She came and laid the check down without even asking if we needed anything else.

Probably won't bother giving them another try..."}
{"text":"A change from my usual New Mexican fare. Not super spicy but with good flavors all around. A throwback to restaurants in the 70's. I am just getting over a cold so I want to return when I can explore the menu more."}
{"text":"Their bean and cheese burritos along with the salsa on top is a guilty pleasure of mine...

Tried a green chili chicken enchilada today and enjoyed it! Just the right amount of spice and full of flavor. 

Prices are great, authentic food! Try it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I usually go to Joanna's at mill/southern in Tempe. Was I'm this part of town during lunch so stopped by.  Green chili burro was good. Taco was burnt. Taking my bean burro w me. Waitress brought my food and never came back but to give my togo. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I went to Xavier's on the recommendation of a friend.  This was my first trip to this location.  Although the food was fairly tasty I was met with some surprises.  First off, this location doesn't provide their patrons with the usual bowl of chips and salsa that are typically served by other Mexican restaurants when you are first seated.  This is an extra cost ($2.50, I believe).  Next, I ordered their grande margarita that was supposed to be made with 3 shots of tequila per 7 oz. glass.  The margarita had a nice sweet/sour taste to it but being a bartender in a previous life I could tell there were not 3 shots of tequila in the glass.  Maybe in the pitcher they poured it from but not in the glass.  When it came to ordering my meal I learned that the combo plate I ordered didn't come with the standard rice and beans as an accompaniment.  That also was an extra charge ($3, I believe).  I ordered the chili relleno, taco and enchilada combo plate.  When my plate was served I was surprised at the size of the chili relleno.  It was about 3/4 the length of my palm (which is about 4 inches long).  Now I'm used to chili rellenos that are about 7 inches long so this seemed strange to me.  When I mentioned something to the waitress she graciously offered to bring me another which ended up being only slightly bigger than the first.  No worries, the two combined equaled one normal sized relleno so I was happy.

Food & drink comments aside, the restaurant is clean and well appointed with tables spaced sufficiently apart that neighboring conversations don't bleed over into yours.  The service was courteous and prompt and the plates were served hot as expected.  The restaurant is family oriented so bring the kids.  As long as you understand that a few items that are normally price combined or provided without extra charge in other Mexican restaurants are priced separately here then I suggest you try this restaurant.  Just bring plenty of pesos."}
{"text":"Unbelievable! You haven't had Mexican food until you've eaten here. Everything I've had on the menu has been made me feel like I died and gone to heaven. I recommend anything with green chile on it."}
{"text":"The worst, most unfriendly service, awful salsa, overpriced and did I mention it took forever to get our food?"}
{"text":"Not going here anymore. $4 for this sample size cup of guacamole. I can't believe it. Plus the servers are rude. Idk it's because they're young and have no customer service skills oR manners!! But ridiculous. Last straw."}
{"text":"I'm not kidding and neither is this place, the green chili bean & cheese burrito is amazing! Once we found this place we went twice in one week! Now I live in downtown Phoenix & can't wait to make the trek to Mesa to eat here! Family owned too!"}
{"text":"Good food, definitely all homemade.  Taco was nice an crispy and filling was tasty.   Enchilada was also good.   I didn't care for the red sauce they use.   If you like a nearly sweet tasting red sauce with cinnamon or nutmeg , you'll like it. The good is served up nice and gets hot which is nice.  Salsa is mediocre.   Server was pleasant and kept up on what we needed."}
{"text":"Not too much to love or hate about this place.  Traditional Mexican fare for the masses."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we won't be returning. The environment is quaint and from what we saw, clean. The service from the Hostess to our Waitress was good. The food however, was not. The salsa was descent but the chips were very stale. We had the red cheese enchiladas with sides of rice and beans. The onions on the enchiladas were too large it ruined the flavor and rice was mushy. I really wanted to enjoy this restaurant but can't say we'll be back."}
{"text":"Another excellent Mexican food restaurant. Try the gollo burro . Whole beans with green chili pork. Great stuff. The salsa is unique with cinnamon but tastes excellent."}
{"text":"In keeping with my mantra of commenting on the very best or worst, I'm happy to give Xavier's 5 star.. we stumbled on this place by sheer accident. 

Our typical mainstay is Nando.. which is decent, but definitely several levels below Xavier's was swamped.. with a long wait. 

The food and service is fantastic and Margs to die for.


We will definitely be coming back and  Xavier's will be our new go to.

If you like awesome food, killer margs and excellent service.. this place is for you."}
{"text":"So I am a long time regular at the Tempe location. Last night since we moved to Mesa we decided to try this location. Same menu I ordered what I usually get and my boyfriend ordered the soft tacos. Let me tell you the food was horrible bland and the soft tacos hardly had any meat in them tons and tons of lettuce and they were falling apart soggy like they were dipped in grease and filled. My burrito was nothing but tortilla and just a very small amount of red meat in it. And on top of it our server only checked on us once and then dropped the check. I'm so disappointed in this location I was happy it was close but I'll just make the drive to Tempe from now on."}
{"text":"It was good, but not great. The prices are good, but in both burro's we ordered, there was only a very small amount of meat in the middle of both burro's. It was a bit of a rip off in that sense. 
Flavours were good, but you can get a massive meat stuffed burrito at Filiburtos for 5.50. 
The taco was pretty terrible. The tamale had so much masa that it was literally inedible. 
The chips and salsa are great. 
The best thing is the green chile burro, green style, but again, 4 chunks of meat in the middle doesn't make up for the price."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food! Amazing service and delicious food. PS- the salsa is amazing!"}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken taco, beef taco, tostada, bean burrito, chips. Paid 22.00. Chicken taco very small and tasteless/oily, same with the beef, pathetically small portions, no flavor, tostada had soggy lettuce and no cheese to speak of. Presentation very poor. Unfortunately once again coming from California, Arizonans don't know Mexican food if they rate this as high as they do. I would have better off going to Del Taco even though I wouldnt."}
{"text":"Classic Mexican food for a really great price. They have really good enchilada sauce their tacos are very good. I love the special bean burro with green chili and butter.

If you love Mexican food you gotta try this place out."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here! the enchiladas (green chili Pork) are the Bomb! Both of my son's and I love coming here! The food is delicious and the people that work here are always super friendly. I love coming here!!! I would highly recommend this restaurant to everyone!"}
{"text":"This has been my go to Mexican food restaurant in Mesa for the past 18 years! To this day, their retried beans/bean burros I've had anywhere and I eat a lot of bean burros! Get it enchilada style and it may be even better.

They've recently moved down the street into a larger restaurant, but the food is the same great food. It is family owned and operated by the Reynoso family who are all great people.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Not very good. Chips were stale and the oil used to cook the rellenos must have been used to cook fish! The beans were good and the green chili enchilada was okay.
This was our first visit and it will be out last. They do not do the Reynoso family recipes justice. It's a shame"}
{"text":"Let's TACO about this place. We showed up a little early and there was already a line waiting outside, what's going on here?!? I ordered a simple cheese enchilada combination with rice and beans. It came with a taco. Omg, the taco was fantastic, I would go back just for the taco's. My rice was yummy as well. Very clean establishment and friendly staff. We were constantly attended to. I plan on going back soon. I need some tacos!"}
{"text":"I really really enjoyed my meal! I ordered the bean and cheese burrito \"green style\" which had green sauce and melted cheese. I added a small side of rice. It was a nice quick date night with friendly servers and chips and salad brought to the table as we were seated."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed. Took 25 min to be seated, 15 for our drink order & after waiting an hour for our food we decided to walk out."}
{"text":"I moved here from New Mexico and I have been trying to find a Mexican food place that is similar to back home. This place is very good! It's spicy and delicious! I will be coming back here again for sure."}
{"text":"Came with a group of about 15 and we immediately seated which was really nice since we were on a lunch break from a training session. Service was expedient and friendly - a solid 4 for service.

Food for me was more of a 2.5 to 3 in my opinion. Chips for salsa were fresh and light; salsa was pretty average with not much heat at all. We also ordered an appetizer of bean dip and, um, is it s'posed to be just beans and a little cheese mixed in? Why don't they just say \"a side of beans\" instead of an appetizer of bean \"dip\"?

My entree was the Verde Half and Half from the Special Chili Plates. I think the whole concept of half and half was lost in the watery, soupy mess on my plate. There was so much liquid from the green chile portion of my plate that all the juices enveloped the beans and they turned into complete liquid as well. As for flavor? Nice flavor but very little spice. Beans were just ok. I actually had to salt my plate a little to bring out some of the heat and flavor of the chiles. And I find it truly odd that a Mexican restaurant would serve a meal side flour tortilla all nice and hot and BUTTERED. MANTEQUILLA. I've never experienced that in a Mexican restaurant before. No me gusta.

I think I'd go back but definitely order something different from my selection on this day."}
{"text":"IMHO Casa Reynoso is the best Mexican food in the valley.  A good friend of mine is from Miami, AZ, which is where the Reynoso family originated as well, so we have been eating Casa for quite some time now.  I took my boyfriend there for his first time this week.  We started with a plain cheese crisp (you can't go wrong with ordering one of these) but we also tried the JoAnne Special, which is a corn crisp tortilla topped with green chili pork, jalapeno and cheese melted in oven.  It was AMAZING.  It's on the small side, so you may want to order one for each person.  But SO good.  I got my normal red mixed chimichanga which was just as good as always.  The bae got a red mixed burro and a green mixed burro.  However, his favorite part about the meal was the salsa (and he's a salsa snob), he preferred the regular to the hot.  The prices at Casa are super cheap for what you get ($4-5/burro).  The burros reheat really well, so I recommend getting some to go.  The Xaviers Casa Reynoso is a new location (they just relocated from a tiny to-go storefront), it is nice and clean, with plenty of room to dine comfortably.  The waitstaff are very attentive and the food comes to the table fairly quickly.  We will be dining at Casa for many years to come."}
{"text":"I went with my wife to this place and I will NEVER BE BACK AGAIN.
to the wait staff at Xaviers: YOU ONLY HAVE ONE CHANCE TO MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION!!
Our experience started out on a good note. We got seated by a very pleasant long haired girl. She seated us very promptly. We were then asked if we wanted drinks and those came within minutes. Our order was taken and we waited.
And thats when all the inconvenience started:
1.)  We had ordered a cheese crisp as an appetizer. As we waited for our food, we ate the cheese crisp. However, when we got done with our appetizer, the wait staff didn't bother removing the dirty plates or the serving tray that it came on. IT SAT THERE THE ENTIRE MEAL. 
2.)  I think we must have waited for our food a good 30 minutes AFTER we finished our cheese crisp. Judging by the people seated around us, they had been waiting awhile also. My wife surmised that maybe the cook went on break and just got back.
3.) I had to ASK to get my tea refilled. Now I'm not the king of serving and know everything about the industry, but if you are assigned a table shouldn't you be doing your best to wait on that table? just a thought. While I had my tea refilled. The wait staff NEVER bothered with my wife's drink. IT WAS ONLY WATER WITH LEMON. 
4.) We were waited by THREE different staff members. When my wife and I got the check, we were like, \"how do your tip three different people?\"
the food itself was very good, no complaints."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a recommendation from a fellow foodie who I trust. It was a Wednesday around noon so there was no wait, staff was friendly and was seated right away. The waitress was a gem, told her it was my first time and she sat down next to me to explain the menu and what I should try. I got the Joanne Special (cheese crisp appetizer) and Xaviers Burro (not sure the name, but the top choice off the burro portion of the menu). 

I'll go back for the chips and salsa alone. Their regular salsa is amazing, you'll like it, trust me. When she found out I like it hot she brought out another little bowl of fiery goodness, though I like their original better, both are great.

The Joanne cheese crisp will pretty much be a go to every time from now on, Corn tortilla with green chili pork and jalapenos with melted cheese on top....loved it.

The burro was one of the best ever, not that I usually get a burro, more of a chimi, or relleno, or mole kinda guy. But damn good food. If I remember right it was red and green chili served enchilada style. Couldn't have been happier.

I've been to just about every \"recommended\" Mexican restaurant throughout the Phoenix area, Carolina's, Comedor Guadalajara, Barrio Queen, Mi Patio, Valle Luna, Los Dos Molinos, La Hacienda, Los Sombreros, etc, etc. 

Gotta say I'm proud Mesa has Xaviers now..Will go back and probably try everything on the menu. No it's not like Barrio Queen or La Hacienda, but for a sit down place in Mesa I can't think of anywhere else I'd rather go. Prices are cheap and there's nothing exotic, just damn good food!...

(this is the old Mike Thai restaurant, tho I'm glad Xaviers is there now I sure do miss Mike Thai, some of the best Thai food to grace the Mesa area)

Anyway, check it out, what else ya got? Nandos? Serranos? Bleck...."}
{"text":"Our family has been going here practically since I was born.  For almost 30 years starting at the Tempe location.  The Reynoso family originally started in Tempe but we find that this location of the daughter's family is better.  It is nice when we get to speak to the owner daughter.  Better points of the Mesa location rather than the Chandler or Tempe location is that they put more in your burrito or just give you more food for the price you pay and they seem more down to earth and comfortable to be around their family and servers give pleasant customer service.  

Now on to the rating....the refried bean and cheese burrito is the best!  They make their refried beans from scratch everyday!  If you get it in the restaurant they butter the top of the burrito which is delicious.  If you get it \"to go\" they don't unless you ask and specify it.  Next, their Salsa is Amazing!  It is the best salsa I've ever tasted.  A little watery but Amazing!  Not to hip on their tortilla chips, their chips are heavy and somewhat chewy and not light and airy like they should be.

Their \"Gollo Burro\" and \"Machaca\" are pretty good in taste.  Although many times the Burro is not full and the Machaca is not very well packed with shredded beef or sometimes they can be just skimpy on the ingredients in general depending on the day.  But definitely not as bad as the Chandler and Tempe locations in being skimpy or giving to little food for the price you pay.  Out of the two the \"Gollo Burro\" is the Best in taste.  I believe it's the green chili that does it.

Their tacos and enchiladas are nothing special.  The tacos are chewy in the shell rather than crunchy and again can many times have little in them.  The enchiladas are small for the price you pay and do not have much in them either.  

Their Chili Rellenos \"eehh\".  I've had better made from my mom.  Again very little in them.  Would like to see a really fat stuffed great tasting one with amazing cheese and shredded beef.

Last but not least....Their Cheese Crisp is crisp, buttery, and deeeelicious!  Just the right amount of cheese...(lots;)  And it is especially delicious dipped in their salsa!

So here's the deal!  If you dine in get two bean and cheese burritos, chips and salsa, and a large cheese crisp as an appetizer wash it down with a soda and you'll have an amazing lunch or dinner.  Make sure ya bring a friend or you'll never finish the cheese crisp alone!;)

P.S.  If ya want to try something more than a burrito, definitely try the \"Gollo Burro\"!"}

{"text":"The food it hot and \"globish\" the enchilada sauce has a tangy cinnamony flavor I must have missed the onion the taco is good the meat is roast beef but could use a bit more meat. The relleno is tasty not much spice it could use the green sauce on it. The chips were solid good the salsa was surprisingly spicey good flavor an undamiliar spice in there maybe cinnamon. 
All in all it was a good meal.. filling satisfying and tasty."}
{"text":"The food is really good-Globe Az style Mexican food. But the service was kinda slow. It looked like there were only 2 waitresses serving the entire restaurant, so I felt bad for them, but it took a while to get our food. We also got take out once too and it took over 30 minutes to make. Yummy food but definitely slow. If you are in a hurry, don't go here."}
{"text":"If you are a vegetarian or a vegan, especially vegan, I would not come here. I didn't even choose to come here. I ordered a vegetarian burrito without cheese. It had lettuce, diced tomatoes, pinto beans and rice which I requested, other wise it would only have had lettuce, tomatoes, beans and cheese. Worst burrito I have EVER eaten in my life. Taco Bell's bean and cheese burrito is better than this, Del Taco's vegi burrito is better than this. I understand this place, probably doesn't cater to vegetarians, it's a Mexican restaurant, I get it. When I'm impressed with a place I will commend them when I'm so disappointed I will comment that too. The reason it was so bad is there, was no flavor in anything. The Pinto beans seems like they had been soaked and cooked without any seasoning, even just salt. Same with the rice, it was an orange color, but flavorless, how does this happen? Tomatoes, no flavor. The lettuce probably was the least horrible part. If it had cheese I'm sure that cheese would have been tasteless and orange like the rice. Don't even get me started on those tortillas.......they taste like they were bought from the store!! Come on. If you're gonna put something on your menu, then it should taste good. Very low quality ingredients. This is Arizona man, we know good Mexican food, I know good Mexican food, made with love. Please Lord help me not to feel so disgusted after taking this into my body. I feel gross. They did take it off the bill, which was nice of them*"}
{"text":"Awful service, when even provided service. No drink checks. Party of 10 and everyone's food came out at different times. Also asked for \"no onions\" meal was covered in onions and everyone else at the table was done eating, so didn't even eat. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Gollo green style. It is my go-to at Casa Reynoso.

First time to this location and our burritos were out FAST! Almost before 2 teenagers finished the bowl of chips. The burritos were hot, fresh and tasty. I have heard mixed reviews on the other offerings but have never gone wrong with the Gollo. Plain is fine, but \"green style\" smothers it in green sauce, tops it with cheese, and gets it a trip in the oven to melt everything together. Careful, HOT plate! 

Since this location is closer to our house than the one near ASU, we'll probably be coming here more often than that location. From what we could tell, the food is the same, even if the location is smaller with less parking."}
{"text":"We have been frequent customers of theirs for over 20 years, back when they first opened at their Val Vista and Southern location. They are seriously the best Mexican food around! Their flavors are consistent and always good, and they never disappoint. My husband has been in love with their Gollo burro since the second time we ate there back in 1996, and I switch back and forth between the Gollo burro, and their number 3, which is a tamale, enchilada, and tostada. The cheese crisp with jalapeños is our favorite as is their bean dip. Their salsa is seriously addicting! Try them out. This is a family own and run restaurant and serve good Mexican food the way it should be done!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff!  I love the roomy feel and the way the tables are set up.  It makes it seem less crowded and less noisy.  The prices were great and food was top notch.  Cheese crisp is popular and was very yummy.  Will visit again."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a party of 7. Food came out at different times for our table which was totally unprofessional. Burritos were small and had hardly any meat! The rice was horrible, sticky,no flavor. Will never go back or recommend it to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"We come here regularly. We used to get only to-go orders but since the new location opened we have been dining in probably half the time now. This is a different type of Mexican food, I grew up calling it Globe style (Globe-Miami, AZ has a unique style and this is identical, in fact the owners I believe are from that area). Most people love it but I'm sure some won't, I haven't taken a person yet who didn't love it though. Salsa is great and unique. Love the cheese crisps to start. We used to just order lots of burritos and salsa to-go but since dining in we have switched to combos and they are always delish. I have not personally had one bad experience with food or service and always recommend this place to anyone wanting good Mexican food."}
{"text":"The service here was exceptional and so were the prices, but the food was just ok.  Good but not the kind of Mexican food that hits a home run.  A bit bland.  Portions were very generous and the salsa was tasty. I had an enchilada and a taco.  Great taco but the enchilada sauce left me wanting something with more zing.  I will go back and try something different next time."}
{"text":"This place was the first good Mexican restaurant that I've found since moving to AZ 2 years ago!  The burro Xavier's way was awesome."}
{"text":"My in laws are in town and their friend had told them about this restaurant. We looked it up and made the 25min drive. The restaurant is big and clean. The place was busy so we knew it was good.

The menu seems small compared to most Mexican restaurants. Our complimentary chips and salsa came and the chips seem a little stale. The salsa was spicy, just the way I like it. My husband and MIL got the enchiladas, portions seemed small but it filled them up. I ordered the taco salad and it was by far the best taco salad I've ever had. The shredded chicken and the crispy tortilla was so good. My FIL got tacos and it looked good. One of my daughters got chicken tenders (I know!) and she ate the whole thing. My FIL also got a margarita and he said it was really good, he almost got a second one. Lol!

All in all great experience besides the drive and stale chips. There are so many restaurants that the only way we'd go back is if we were in the area."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food! One of our favorite places in the valley. Everything we've had here is good. I always get the bean and cheese burro enchilada style with the red sauce. The Gollo Burro is also top notch. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food as usual is amazing. Never disappointed. Only thing that would make it better is if they sold beer."}
{"text":"The food was very fresh, oven hot, and delicious.  I ordered soup and an entree. The soup came out the same time as the meal. Would have been nice if it had come out earlier."}
{"text":"So was expecting a lot from this place based on a friends review and was let down they did not meet my expectations. The service was ok and the food was good but not great. The chili relleno was gross! It tasted like old fryer oil. I would go back because everything else was good but stay away from the relleno for sure.."}
{"text":"Love love love Xavier's!
We moved to TX almost 4 years ago and boy do we miss Xavier's Casa Reynoso. It's the real deal Mexican food, not TexMex. We go to Xavier's every time we return to visit AZ.
The restaurant is small and occasionally so busy you can't find a place to sit but the food is so amazing that I will wait for a seat to open up.
Their food is the best in town. They have a bunch of other family members that own restaurants around the Valley and throughout AZ (Globe, Phoenix, Tempe, Chandler) and are all very similar in taste but Xavier's seems to be better than his relatives; though I'd never pass up a meal at any of his other family members restaurants."}
