{"text":"My husband and I quickly became regulars at this joint.  I think we've had most of the items on the menu.  Being a breakfast and lunch diner, they became a weekend destination.   It has a very friendly atmosphere and normally has something funny on the board outside.  There is normally a ton of parking on the street and if there is not, there is a parking lot a block or so down.  That area of the city is quickly changing with some little stores so go have some breakfast or lunch and walk around a bit.  Remember, they are cash only still."}
{"text":"Scenario: you woke up, belly's rumblin', your fridge is empty and cupboard is out of coffee. You really only have one choice, Shelly's. Best breakfast in the city, situated in historic Allentown. But don't take my word for it, try it yourself and become a believer."}
{"text":"I ordered off of Grub Hub and the food was just ok.  I had the sausage wrapped in French toast.  What i was hoping for and what I got were two different things.  The sausages were tiny and the toast was tasteless.  I had to drown it in syrup to tolerate it.  I also had a side of home fries, which were pretty good.  I wouldn't recommend my order, but i might give it another shot...just a different meal."}
{"text":"I ordered breakfast through a mobile ordering app after being tempted for several days now. I ordered pancakes (3 come in an order) and a sausage omelette that came with home fries and toast. The order was still at a nice temperature and fresh. The pancakes were excellent! The syrup they serve goes nicely with them too. The omelette was good. I didn't like the sausage used so next time I would probably just get a cheese omelette. Toast comes dry, not pre buttered like other places do and the home fries were tasty. Pretty nice breakfast overall and close to home!"}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends for breakfast on a Friday and though it's not in the most \"tourist-y\" area, it was a pleasant experience! We seated ourselves and were greeted immediately. Our drinks were brought to us in a timely manner and shortly after ordering, our delicious breakfast arrived!   I personally think you can never go wrong with breakfast because it's the most important and BEST meal of the day.. Anyway, the food was delicious. Tasted fresh and we were served pretty big portions! You definitely get bang for your buck here. There was parking along the street outside. They accept cash only though! There's an ATM inside but make sure you bring some cash so you don't get charged the service fee."}
{"text":"When I walked into this place I thought I was sent back in time. It reminded me of all the small luncheonettes and diners I remembered growing up in N.Y. (only bigger). I wound up owning my own luncheonette for 9.5 years. The breakfast my family and I had was wonderful. Fresh ground Columbian coffee was a nice start. All the eggs and omelets we had were cooked just the way we asked for them. Very nice portions and the waitress was AWESOME. Every time I go back to Pitt this will be my breakfast spot."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this out of the way place.  It was really nice with friendly staff and patrons.  Food was good too."}
{"text":"I tried this place today and wasn't sure how it was gonna be but glad I did,  this place isn't anything fancy or even true to be its a nice little diner with a nice full deli,  nice to see small businesses in the area and seems to do very well.  I had the breakfast burrito with a choice of meat inside it was huge,  very good. Nice service and I will definitely return to try other items so hard to choose the first time there."}
{"text":"Attempted to order takeout today at 2:40 and was told they were closed after walking in the front door. The door was unlocked and the sign on the door says they close at 3:00pm. Will not be coming back here since they do not want the business."}
{"text":"Went there last week with a friend and was at first wondering if the place was open.i guess they're still finding they're place.the service was great ,very friendly waitresses who told us it was pretty much a family affair as far as the workers.i ordered a burger which was the special for 7.00.My burger was great ,juicy and seven on what they call a Dutch roll (I think)to me it was a cibatta bread roll and was great.Fresh cut fries were ok.My friend had a steak hoagie and fries,he said was excellent.i couldn't believe the place was empty.Someone did pickup a to go order and didn't bother to tip by the way.I suggested they maybe open earlier for breakfast and promote to the potential customers at the nearby police station and port authority garage.I will go back soon and often"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stopped at Breakfast at Shelly's Sunday morning around 10am. Much to our surprise, the place was empty! It quickly became clear that they do a lot of business through grubhub. I ordered the breakfast sandwich with hot sausage and home fries (my go to) and my fiancé ordered the standard #2 (2 eggs over easy, sausage, home fries, and toast). The sandwich came on a Dutch crunch bun which was delish. The sausage wasn't your standard patty or link, it was hand formed and grilled to perfection. Neither the fried egg nor the sausage was overly greasy which made the sandwich that much better.  The home fries were cooked nicely with a seasoning blend that sets them apart from all the other diners. Overall, the only thing lacking was that diner \"feel.\" We will likely return!"}
{"text":"Shelly's is a great neighborhood diner with good, straightforward breakfast food. There's also a lunch menu, butI haven't checked it out yet. As a bonus, pick up some soup or lunchmeat on your way out at the deli!"}
{"text":"The food was bad. The restaurant was cold. The wait was long. We arrived at about 11:00am on a Thursday. There were 2 other people there who had walked in moment before us. My fiancée ordered a waffle and one egg scrambled. I ordered their Special #2 ( 2 eggs over easy; home fries; bacon; toast). It took about 25 minutes to get our food.The waffle was burnt on the bottom. Like literally black, no exaggeration. The top wasn't burnt it was sprinkled with powdered sugar and looked amazing. But he took a bite and it tasted like it was burnt and it was...SMH. Like why would you still serve this, just remake it. The egg was subpar. My eggs over easy cake out over cooked, not even eggs over medium consistency like completely cooked through..SMH. The bacon was good (you can't really mess up bacon..IJS). The home fries not good at all. Maybe this is a Pittsburgh dish and it's an acquired taste but if not then these were just down right nasty.  Then to top it all off I threw up after eating the edibles parts of this dish.   Eat at your own risk. There was quite a bit of traffic around 12 so maybe this is an acquired taste but me and my Midwest- tastebuds do not agree with this place.  The one star is for the easy parking and the cheap prices (13 bucks for everything listed above)."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast as long as you aren't picky about how your eggs are cooked. Asked for sunny side up and got over hard, then asked for a replacement of sunny side up eggs and got over easy. Wasn't even busy in there.  But the food itself was good. I've tried multiple sandwiches there, all great. Try anything on a Dutch crunch roll and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Terrible, ordered this off of grub hub and ordered the protein packer and calis breakfast sandwich. Calis sandwich was not a sandwich they just threw all the ingredients into the box. The protein packed had barely any chicken and was very small for the price. Would not order from here again. I could have made this better."}
{"text":"Great diner!  Food tastes fresh and portions are large.  They have a basic breakfast and lunch menu that they do very well (instead of a huge menu where everything is so-so), but the gold star goes to their breakfast burritos.  Huge and packed with good stuff!  Prices are very reasonable and staff is friendly, but not hovering.  It's never been super-busy when we've been there.  It looks like they've made some improvements to the dining area since last time we were in - it seemed a lot brighter.  The neighborhood is undergoing a bit of revitalization, but don't let that keep you away.  It's just a few minutes off Route 51 or Arlington Ave and located on a main road.  Parking is very close and easy on the side streets.  There's a good mix of locals, but you don't get that \"outsider\" feeling.  Really hope this place stays around for awhile."}
{"text":"Moved to Allentown recently and so glad we found Breakfast at Shelly's. Every time we come here the food and service is always excellent. And such low prices. Only takes cash. But with such low prices it's not an issue at all. Have tried many different items off the menu and everything is delicious."}
{"text":"We came for a late lunch in a Saturday. It was recommended to me by the barista at Black Forge Coffee, who is also a server at Shellys. The building has a great feel, definitely not fancy, but very comfortable and clean. All of our food was very good, and fairly priced. We will be returning here."}
{"text":"Don't let the location discourage you, during the daytime anyways. :)  Does very well for all of your standard diner fare, not anything as far as especially appetizing ingredients at least on the breakfast items."}
{"text":"The breakfast was excellent. My cheese omelette was done just right and everything else was quite pleasantly satisfying to my tastebuds :)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is retro-darling, clean and attentive.  The food is great and they keep your coffee filled. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"The hot breath omelet lives up to its name. The hot sausage is made in house and you can definitely tell. The toast options were a little disappointing (no Italian and all bagged bread), but I'd recommend it to anyone in the area looking for a greasy diner option for breakfast."}
{"text":"I had breakfast with Shelly's on my visit to Pittsburgh this time around. Am sure Pamela will be upset when she reads this, but you gotta do what makes you happy. This is a new business at a location that previously housed a dinner for decades. The interiors are unassuming and call out Steelers only, but the owner and servers are really very friendly. There are tables for large groups and comfy bar stools. I ordered spinach feta tomato omelette, they delivered exactly what it says, nothin more nothin less. The portion sizes are right and the food is not as greasy as the other more popular spots. The home fries are probably how I would make them at my home. Do bring cash as they do not accept cards here. Touchdown for me...definitely would come singing for the potato and omelette ...brown and yellow, brown and yellow, brown and yellow"}
