{"text":"This used to be our favourite local AYCE. Service has unfortunately gone down since our last visit. The servers are very inattentive and disinterested. Food is coming out much more slowly on purpose I believe. They now charge 1.99 for green tea which used to be included. Sushi and rolls have gotten smaller etc. Hot food is barely warm and tastes like it has been sitting. We will be finding another AYCE place next time."}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant with nice decor. AYCE selection was pretty decent. Service was good.   BUT I had a terrible stomach ache right after!! I think it had to do with the sashimi I ate. It wasn't fully thawed yet so I could feel bits of ice as I was chewing. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Honestly everything was bad. You walk in and there's like 10 tables and it looks crowded and messy.  The girl takes one look at us, points at a table and walks away. Ooook? So we sit down.  The tables are sticky. That is so gross to me!  Then she slaps down a menu and the list to choose from and walks away. Eventually she comes back and asks about drinks. We get our drinks and our food quickly.   All the rolls taste exactly the same. They all look like a California roll. This was really disappointing coming from markham where they are really creative and skilled with their sushi.   They never came back to ask us how we were or if we wanted more until we asked for the bill.   I'll never go back."}
{"text":"The California Rolls are out of this world.  Great Place for Lunch or just hang out with friends"}
{"text":"I have loved this place for a long time.  There were the occasional mess  up with items that we didn't order delivered to our table, or other times items that we did order never arriving.  We figured it was a result of the place being busy and didn't detract from the food itself.  I would say we have been there maybe 20 times over the years but tonight will be our last visit.  I ordered a new item for me, sesame chicken and when it came to the table, as soon as I quit talking with my dinner date, I saw a very large piece of wire sticking out of one of the pieces of chicken.   I pulled it out,and it appeared to be a piece of a wire brush used to scrub grills.  I called the waitress back, and showed it to her.  She looked at it, and explained that it was part of a wire scrubber.  I told her I knew what it was, but why was it in my food?  She took the sesame chicken back to the kitchen but I was just done.  The few items left I flipped around and closely examined from every angle before putting it in my mouth.  I would have quite honestly been less worried about a hair in my food than a wire.  I could have cut my mouth or damaged my teeth.  Sorry Makimono, your kitchen cleaning should not leave anything in the food.  It shouldn't leave soap residue, pieces of cleaning equipment, broken glass, or anything else that could possibly wind up in the food.  There should be safeguards in food preparation, and if I'm getting a large piece of wire, clearly visible to the naked eye as soon as the plate is presented, it makes me wonder what I might have eaten on previous visits that I just didn't see."}
{"text":"I come here a lot as it is on my way home from work. I've had some amazing sushi in my life - created by world-class artistic sushi chefs.   Let's be honest, this is hard to come by in the Durham Region but this is my go-to.   It's cheap-ish, fast, they do take out and it's regional. I usually go for take out. I normally get spicy salmon, avocado, and spicy crab. I'm usually satisfied. I always complain they use too much sauce/mayo.   That's basically it."}
{"text":"I used to be pleasantly surprised with this place after being so disappointed years ago. Well today my disappointment reached its max. Hair in my sushi is where I draw the line. The server's solution? To steal the plate and apologize after the fact. Won't be coming here ever again."}
{"text":"Yes, great stuff.  Best sushi in the area.  Fresh.  And we regularly 'abuse' ; ) the all-you-eat option."}
{"text":"New location opened this week, great atmosphere and Fresh food. The menu items are the same as before but the quality of food has improved. Service is good as well, recommend this place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The renovations are excellent, the AYCE menu is generous, and the seafood quality is top notch.  Makimono has very quickly become our restaurant of choice for all you can eat sushi. Highly recommend making this yours too!"}
{"text":"Food was good - pretty average for an AYCE restaurant.  Service was not all that great."}
{"text":"I like the new makimono place but I'm not satisfied with the food. I ordered the vegetable box and that includes avocado rolls, rice, endamame, vegetable tempura and tofu tempura. Rolls are not fresh, broccoli tempura was soggy and my bento box plate was chipped and colour was fading. Why???? I like the servers though. They are friendly but I'm sorry I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"I stayed away from this restaurant because I saw the bad reviews here on Yelp. Big mistake. This AYCE place is excellent! You order your food off iPads and the food comes quickly and is delicious. I first went 1.5 months ago and I have already returned 4-5 times for AYCE.   I order spicy salmon everything and it always tastes fresh! I have never gotten sick, just really full! My husband does not eat sushi or even fish and there is still a lot on the AYCE menu that he can order.   The service here isn't as bad as the other reviewers make it seem. You have to keep in mind that this is an AYCE Sushi restaurant. This isn't a regular sit-down, order off the menu restaurant or a buffet like Mandarin. You order your food off the iPad, they bring it to you and remove your empty plates as they walk by. Yes, it might take a bit longer to get a refill on your water. You might even have to flag someone down and ask more than once. In my experience, that's EVERY AYCE sushi places. Those waiters are so busy, they never even get a chance to sit down during their shifts. Cut them some slack or don't go to an AYCE place.   Let's all collectively stop being jerks and giving places like this bad reviews, when their food is fantastic and the service isn't bad.  I should also mention that I bring my 6 month-old baby each time and never had a problem."}
{"text":"So, I'm here visiting a friend in Ajax and he suggests that we try this new Japanese restaurant near his house. So tonight we go in, and OMG! It's got an all-you-can-eat option. The last time I had all-you-can-eat sushi was back in NYC when I didn't know what good sushi tasted like. So, with apprehension we enter the restaurant. I was surprised at how elegant the decor was; beautiful white, green and cream colors with dark wood furniture and accents. Slate floors and comfortable white leather chairs. If I didn't live thousands of miles away I would steal these lovely chairs. Okay but let's get to the food.   We did decide to go with the all-you-can-eat option. We ordered a ton of food. Miso soup, crunchy green salad with a tasty dressing (really you should try this dressing at least once). Veggie tempura was  good and not over battered. selection was good and you could just order the items you like. We liked them all. California roll and Rainbow roll were good - not great, but decent. Beef short ribs were great, tender and not too fatty. We also ordered the sushi pizza. I was more curious than scared, but we opted for a veggie one, to be safe. It was delicious. It came on a fried rice patty, like a hash brown but with rice, a spicy sriracha sauce on the rice and a mix of yummy veggies and topped with creamy avocado. If we didn't already order too much food, I'd have gotten a second one. Then we had sashimi! We ordered a bunch of pieces, some butter fish, white fish (both were good) some squid (so much better than we thought - we'd never had this before and it was rich and creamy, not chewy at all) and a ton of salmon. The pieces were SO generously cut. I would recommend ordering less so that you don't get too full too soon. The wait staff was nice and quick with our order. I was a little nervous seeing so much food on the table but we managed to eat it all and had a little bit of room left for ice cream. This is a great place and has tons of cooked food options for friends not interested in sushi. Next time time I'm here, I'll be back."}
{"text":"We visit this place regularly, about 3 times a month for lunch. You have two choices. All-you-can-eat (AYCE) or entrées. We never choose the AYCE, so I can't speak to that.  For the entrées, it's great because the meal  is quick, and the Bento Boxes we choose are just $9.95 for lunch. You can spend less, but we prefer the box with the tofu, tempura and the California/Sushi rolls.  For us, we can never finish and usually take some home for a snack for dinner.  The tea is served in a cup, and we would prefer a tea pot, but \"oh we'll\". However, they do serve the water with a slice of lemon. Thumbs up!  Plus a miso soup and salad is included at the start.  The service is OK. I think there is a bit of a language barrier with some staff, but our orders are simple, so not an issue for us.  Overall, it's good value. We keep going back."}
{"text":"The place is ok.  Didn't like how the sashimi was still partly frozen."}
{"text":"Good sushi Apple is a great waitress very friendly never had a bad experience there quite busy at times you may get turned away ,but overall a nice place good food ,clean ,parking is decent certainly worth checking out"}
{"text":"This restaurant offers everything you'd want in a sushi restaurant. I've been to this location many times and am pleased to be a customer of their's.   They have a friendly and helpful staff, decent dining environment, and the price is not expensive at all.  The most important is the food however! I think that they offer a fantastic selection of different foods. They use an iPad menu with great pictures/explanations of what's offered. The quality itself of the food- I wouldn't say it's superb but I've never been disappointed and have always been more than pleased with my food.   I'd definitely recommend this establishment to others. It will be a good experience and is very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Best sushi I have had in a while. The food is always fresh. the all you can eat is good for the price.  Nice place the place in Ajax is a little small, the one in Pickering is a lot bigger."}
{"text":"Just one word \"SHIT!\". The food was horrible the service suck, one of the Chinese server with curly just called me and my friend stupid in Chinese (she thought we don't speak Chinese) in front of our table and then gossip about us to other server. She has done it more than one time and she gossip about other costumers too., never going back ever rather go to another sushi restaurant, people better watch your back or she will call you stupid too!!"}
{"text":"Great family restaurant!  Efficient service but not overly warm.  Food was AWSOME and fresh...especially the handrolls, sushi & sashimi.  With AYCE....we tried so many different dishes and all were delicious.  The food quality is far better than the Pickering location.  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This used to be our go to place for Sushi but the service has been disappointing of late. Today they behaved rather oddly when we had 5 person group with one person who was not into Sushi so they seated 5 people on a 4 person table, believe it or not!!! They were not even busy. Did not make any sense."}
{"text":"As said before by previous visitors its more a place to get your sushi to take away as it is a smaller venue to stay in to dine, but well worth it if you manage to get a table. The hand rolls are excellent and I highly reccomend trying as many as you can :)"}
{"text":"Don't think I'm coming back ever again. My mother ordered the sashimi lunch combo and we asked to take out the crab anf switch it with anything because my mother is allergic to crab. The manager AMY refused to switch it to anything without charging 1.99. Ummm I'm sorry you have to charge us extra when someone is allergic to something?! She said We could order the more expensive combos as a suggestion.   all in all I'm going to make the drive over to sushi legend in Scarborough soooooo much better"}
{"text":"Definitely the best sushi AYCE restaurant in Durham! Their salmon sashimi could be fresher but still really good! As a fellow sushi lover, I don't usually review sushi restaurants lightly. Their flavours were amazing expect for a couple dishes (they were either too salty or sweet; pad Thai, general Tao chicken, and fried chicken udon) and under the recommendation of fellow yelpers, the golden California rolls exceeded my expectations. I also got the mango freeze drink and it was like summer in my mouth!! Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"In Ajax, there are a limited number of Japanese restaurants and an even smaller number of all you can eat.  This establishment is one of the nicer ones. Decor has been refreshed and has a few more tables. It can get very busy during dinner and in weekends causing service to be slow and orders missed. The menu has your typical AYCE fare and noe includes blowtorched sushi."}
{"text":"You know a sushi restaurant is going downhill when they actually charge for tea. The quality of the food that they send out is just sad in comparison to how they used to be. Definitely not a place I would recommend to anyone that actually likes sushi"}
{"text":"A really nice upscale sushi place! I really liked it but the sushi could have been better....maybe I didn't try the right ones but it didn't taste that good to me. Prices are average and decor is nice. Service was meh....they took a lot of my food away when I wasn't even done with them. Also, I asked for wifi and the lady said she will ask and let me know - never did. Totally got ignored."}
{"text":"Worst sushi experience to date.   I avoid all you can eat and prefer omakase.  This place was not for me.  If you like fresh fish. Well prepared and presented sushi and good service.  This is not your place. If you want quantity and a low price point this place has it.  The rolls were descent. The fish was low quality and not well cut. A  It is open late. So that is a plus.  avoid sashimi or nigiri. Will not return. I'd rather eat McDonald's."}
{"text":"I give this Japanese restaurant a 5 star. Fast service! Excellent sushi and good food overall. The place is very Tiny and can get really full. Overall, good eats! I have been multiple times with family"}
{"text":"** fast ** service, great variety, fresh and tasty food. Birthday lunch - all you can eat sushi. iPad ordering makes it so easy to look at what you're getting beforehand. Limited sashimi items but still good, about 4 choices. But everything else, loads of options. Fried banana with ice cream was delicious too. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I ate at the Ajax location for the first time this weekend. First of all, the service is terrible. The waitress forgot my mother's order so my mother was forced to watch us eat our meals while she sat there starving until they finally came with her food. They also kept forgetting to bring us the water that we asked for and when they DID remember they came with a pitcher in hand and filled my dad's glass of beer with water.   The food somewhat made up for the horrible service. I ordered a chicken bento box. It was a good sized portion and quite appetizing although I was not too fond of the shredded cucumber in my cucumber rolls. I prefer thicker slices of cucumber. Otherwise, the gyoza was crispy and tasty and the chicken and tempura was also delicious. I think next time we will just have to order take out because the food is good but the service is below expectations."}
{"text":"The sushi wasn't very good and a disappointment except for the golden California roll which I would recommend. However the tempura & all the teriyaki dishes were excellent. The service was fast & efficient, and the restaurant had a very nice modern atmosphere."}
{"text":"Another great AYCE sushi place in Ajax. The service is good and the food is fresh. Nice modern restaurant that is clean. The selection isn't bad in terms of sushi rolls and cooked items like teriyaki and fried rice but there is limited selection for sashimi - which is what I prefer when I go for sushi. There are also a few Thai and Chinese dishes too for those that don't want to venture too far. Prices are a little high but there isn't a lot of competition either compared to Markham."}
{"text":"Sometimes the food is really good and sometimes its just meh. Very inconsistent but i still find myself going back. Last 2 times have been very good so maybe it's improving!"}
{"text":"Why would anyone order Teriyaki Beef when you can have Black Pepper Beef?!    Their All-You-Can-Eat buffet has an incredible selection as does their regular menu. There are a few Makimono locations but this one, by far, is my favourite.  The service is excellent, the sashimi is fresh and the atmosphere is pleasant."}
{"text":"I went to this location a few times and it was okay but expensive especially if your getting them to at deliver they make you spend $25 in order to get free delivery! I stopped getting food here because one day I ordered some black peppered beef and sushi and I found a finger nail clipping in my beef! I automatically spit it out and demanded a refund which they did. I will never go back to this location again I rather drive the extra 10 minutes up the road to the other Makimono."}
{"text":"I am terribly disappointed. This was one of my fav local places which has steadily gone downhill and tonight's dinner will be my last there. The place used to have a hip groove to it with dark tables and white textured leatherette chairs. Now the tables are covered with atrocious white polyester table cloths and white butcher paper. The fabric bench I sat on had food stains. The AYCE food trough mentality has become the norm.     I ordered my favourite rainbow roll ala carte. I was checking in with friends on social media while I waited and a baby screamed. The couple in the table across from me were puzzling over an iPad menu at their table, trying to identify the plate in front of them.  \"Oh, that's a rainbow roll,\" I told them. \"I ordered one, too.\"    \"Then this must be yours,\" says the guy, grabbing the plate. \"Let me bring it over.\"    \"No, no,\" I say. \"It's yours now.\"  The server comes by, points to the plate and asks a question, then picks up the plate from their table and brings it to me.  I am aghast. I don't even know how to refuse it. But I'm not eating it. The server clues in, asks if anything is wrong. I tell her I'd rather have my own rainbow roll than somebody else's.   Yes, they replaced it. But it was a pale imitation of my fav. No tuna. One measly strip of salmon, a measly strip of white 'tuna' (ick) and lots of avocado. I just took down the luscious picture of their rainbow roll I posted about 3 years ago. It's not the same restaurant and I wouldn't want anyone to be tricked into believing it was."}
{"text":"I love this place! I love the ordering system! I love the speed that the dishes arrive at! I love the food! Their sushi is great, their noodles are great! And their gyoza are to die for!"}
{"text":"Really nice, cozy place with modern atmosphere, great food, and great prices. It didn't blow me away like some of the Asian cuisine I've had at other restaurants, but it was still very delicious. The staff was very friendly and some relaxing piano music played the entire time, not your typical radio tunes. My fiancée and I had the bento boxes. I'd definitely recommend this place if you want some affordable, delicious Japanese food in a comfortable venue."}
{"text":"Rating (3.5) -- Regular AYCE spot, restaurant is a nice size. $25+ for AYCE but we opted a la carte this time because we weren't so hungry. Not the best sushi I've had but it's decent!  Had the dynamite, kamikaze and ocean roll. Ocean roll was subpar but the dynamite and kamikaze were delicious."}
{"text":"Love the Place, I live in the the GTA, and I drive all the way to here just for the Sushi,  Love all their menu,  I would recommend you to go only on Sat,Sun or Wen.. the rest of the days, you can tell almost everything you eat is not fresh!!"}
{"text":"This Makimono location is pretty good in comparison to it's Pickering location. It is a solid AYCE sushi restaurant in the Durham Region.  The atmosphere is good, the service is prompt. They offer the standard AYCE menu, but what sets them apart is their vegetarian options.  They have a great Mango Roll, Yam, Tempura Roll and a couple of other great options.  They get pretty busy on weekends."}
{"text":"The food was good, however the service wasn't, took a long time to serve us our dessert. Maybe waiting at least half an hour, not sure if they were short on staff or not."}
{"text":"I've been to the Pickering location a number of times (and just wrote a review on it) but I came to the Ajax location about a month ago expecting a similarly good experience and ended up a bit disappointed.  This location is a fraction of the size of the Pickering location; there's probably about 10 tables in the entire place. The upside of this is that your food tends to come out at a good pace. However, it seems the servers in this particular location haven't quite grasped good service, and considering how small the restaurant is, it shouldn't be that difficult.  We always get the AYCE at Makimono, I have no idea why you wouldn't because its quite good value for your money. I was generally disappointed with the rolls at this location; haphazardly put together, not very tight and some rolls were a completely different size than at the other location! Some weren't even made the same! We can usually pound back about 12 spicy butterfish rolls but here, they were significantly larger and we had a very difficult time finishing them. I don't know if they get their fish from the same supplier but it just wasn't up to snuff. The sashimi was good, but some of the ingredients in the rolls just weren't as fresh and didn't taste as bright.   Again, the service left something to be desired and service is very important to me. Our server seemed to not care if we wanted to order more and while there were like three servers covering the whole restaurant, they seemed rather detached and working on autopilot. I noticed people walking in and the staff would tell them to sit wherever and then no one would approach the table. One table had to get up 5 minutes afterwards and ask for menus - the place is so small, they could have simply called it across the restaurant but you shouldn't have to do that regardless.  Overall, while there's not a hell of a lot of difference between the locations, I'd travel the extra 15 minutes to the Pickering location to eat there rather than coming to this location.  Better quality rolls, faster service and better (albeit not much better) service."}
{"text":"Food is usually the best for Durham. Brand new space as well really comfortable and clean and spacious.    Wait staff are very attentive and always checking on you and the food is super fast.    Personally I think the food is better if you come for early dinner or early lunch."}
{"text":"Been to a lot of the different franchises, this is probably my favourite one. Great food and service. Can't complain about anything except for the fact they don't accept debit. It's small but really annoying. When I come I'll bring cash or use credit"}
{"text":"I've been to Makimono once. The food was okay, but they didn't have a very large variety of food compared to some other Japanese buffets i've been to. It took about 15-20 minutes for someone to take our order after my friend and I sat down with the menu, and they continued to take a long time to come back to take our orders after we'd finished what was on our plates (the restaurant was virtually empty when we were there, so they weren't busy helping other customers).   My boyfriend seems to really like it, but he doesn't eat sushi so he goes for the beef rice and things like that. He eats at Makimono from time to time, but I decide to eat at home on nights that he goes to Makimono with his friends."}
{"text":"I liked this location better before they expanded. The service was better and faster but now not so much. There have been multiple times where our server gave us attitude and when our orders never showed up despite us ordering it multiple times to see if it would come. I also don't like how they ice a lot of their sashimi now. It looks good but makes some of the sashimi watery."}
{"text":"Quick service.  Good rolls.  Small restaurant. Modern decor.   I met up with an old time friend.  We had a lot of catching up to do, so we spent a while there.  But not for any other reason regarding eating more food.  Our waitress was not friendly.  Took our paper and left.  Took our paper and left.  No communication really.  At one point she came to our table and started to clean up as if we were done.  We weren't lol.  So another waitress came, embarassed by her co-worker and placed more plates etc. on our table.  Overall, I would continue going to Edamame in Pickering, if I'm going to AYCE Sushi close to home, regardless that my home is in Ajax."}
{"text":"Makimono is the absolute BEST restaurant I have EVER gone to. Makimono's service is on point, and their all you can eat is impeccable. Makimono is not the most high end place you can go, but it is extremely close because of the design, cleanliness, friendly staff, I can just not get enough. Makimono is not a restaurant you only go to on special occasions, but you can have it on special occasions. You can go after the gym, or if your feeling tired, just order on the phone and pick up your sushi pizza, or California Roll and BOOM, you got your meal. If you want a restaurant for ANY occasion, that's Makimono. Btw this is my first, and maybe my only review, but I had to do it because it's my favourite restaurant, and most likely the best restaurant I will go to. When I am a billionaire, I will buy this restaurant. This is my favourite restaurant, it's Makimono."}
{"text":"Bering from markham land of sushi and asian food, we are kind of sushi snobs. However, this small place in ajax has surpassed our expectations. Great, friendly and quick service (shocking as other sushi places usually lack service period), clean place, tasty food, prepared fresh to order. Good options for sushi lovers and those who prefer cooked food.  Descriptions of dishes in the actual menu was helpful for those that don't know japanese dishes or the contents of special rolls.  Prices are standard for AYCE. Overall great place, definitely will return when in the ajax area!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy the food at Makimono. I usually get take out due to the limited seating, but I had dinner early one day and ate at the restaurant. It's nice to have fresh, good tasting Japanese food in Ajax."}
{"text":"At first glance it looked great !   Once we sat down after waiting 20 mins after being told 2 minutes   We ordered our drinks but was missing a coke.  We reminded 3 waiters for this.  Waited 1/2 hr before receiving it.   Cooked food came quickly still waiting on sushi.  Service is not the greatest.  Waitress is very abrupt.   Food was not bad - nothing memorable or impressive   No debit is available Only cash or credit at this location.  ATM at front door."}
