{"text":"I like this course. It's always very well maintained. The carts are in excellent shape, all electric and all equipped with GPS. The greens fees are extremely reasonable and many of the holes are challenging, even if you are a better golfer. It truly has a grand view up and down the Mon, from the Triangle and the Cathedral of Learning to Braddock, the Edgar Thompson Works, Kennywood and beyond. Yet, when you go a few more feet on the cart path, you are in the woods, alone with the abundant wildlife. One caveat- bring an abundant supply of balls. If you golf like I do, one sleeve will not be enough!"}
{"text":"Challenging course but a lot of fun. Great service. Friendly staff. Always enjoying coming out for a few hours. Thanks so much! I've been coming here for quite a while and of course will always come back."}
{"text":"Challenging but fun course! Bring plenty of extra balls, I am a novice and lost at least 5. Carts are in great condition and remind you to stay on the cart path (sometimes annoying when looking for balls but safety first) and guide you to the next hole. The pro was very nice and patient with our group as we had to delay teeing off for an hour due to parkway closures. Driving range is nothing to write home about but gets the job done for warming up. Beautiful views and lots of variety of length and layout of holes. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"2nd time playing here. Was in the area for a bowling tournament so a group of us decided to come early and get a round of golf in. The course is hilly and challenging with readable and fairly flat greens. But, as the name suggests, what a Grand View of both the course as well as the surrounding areas.  Carts are in excellent shape and provide you with electronic scoring and course GPS.  The folks here take pride in their course and take very good care of it."}
{"text":"Some of the worst management I have ever seen, while my family and I were driving up to 6 tee box, the starter said that they didn't offer the Twilight special and kicked us off the course. Without a clear explanation other than \"HE\" wanted to go, he proceeded to give us our money back(which he had waiting for us) This isn't the first time we have have problems with this guy. It's a shame going to a course for more than 10 years has to come to an end like that."}
{"text":"I've golfed Grandview a lot, in a weekly league with my VFW, during various charity outings, and with buddies so they could experience a course that defines \"course management\". Control your shots or plan to go through a box of balls - this course challenges you to hit them straight and control the shape of your shots! Always a fun challenge! Afterwards you can enjoy a refreshing beverage and some great food at their bar and restaurant. As you wind down enjoy watching folks try to par the final hole. The pro shop doesn't have a big selection of items - maybe the only drawback. Otherwise, you gotta try it...if you're up to it! FORE!"}
