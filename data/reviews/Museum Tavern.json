{"text":"They have the BEST, I mean the BEST Nachos EVER!! I love nachos especially the cheesy ones!! Here, the Nachos you order has only 8 pieces, BUT covered with melted cheese, guacamole and I think red bean paste!! AMAZING! The salad we ordered was the third on the menu which is also GREAT (don't need extra dressing)"}
{"text":"I went to Museum Tavern today and I found the food to be mediocre and overpriced and the service lacklustre. We were rushed out the door because a large group came and they wanted our table. There are much better places such as the Oxley and the Bedford academy where the service, food and ambience is superior. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Came to celebrate a birthday dinner a couple months ago. There were three of us and we split all of the dishes so that we could try more. None of them disappointed. They were all so delicious that there was nothing left on the plate. We plan on returning as soon as we can so that we can try more. Service with a smile. We had a wonderful waitress as well who was amazing and friendly. The whole experience was well worth it!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great wine, terrific service! Whether you're having drinks with friends, going out to dinner with family or on a date, this place will meet and exceed all expectations! Try the Garden of Eden!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype. Poor drinks and greasy food. We ordered 2 different drinks - both were sweet without any subtleties of other flavours. Service was very slow. It's a good location and the decor inside and the patio is nice. But the quality of food and drinks will not see me going back."}
{"text":"I just had to try this place out because it is so close to home.  There is nothing else like it west of Avenue Road on that strip of Bloor, so they are unique.  I also feel like this place looks like La Societe, with a more cozy tavern look, but that just makes it a very welcome addition to the area.   We were greeted by the most friendly and professional staff person, who asked us how our day was.  It is not necessarily outstanding that he asked us that, but an hour and a half later he remembered everything we had told him when we were leaving!   Of course, he hoped he would see us again.  I thought to myself, wow, that is very good customer service.  The wait staff is very friendly and have great knowledge of everything on the menu.  We started with drinks.  Everyone got beer, except for me, which they enjoyed.  I wanted a cocktail and ordered the Watermelon Collins.  Delicious!  It was fresh and made entirely in house by their mixologist.  Seems like there are a lot more of them popping up around the city these days.  The $12 was a bit pricy.  Salad was a special: heirloom tomatoes with feta.  So fresh and delicious.  I had the Quinoa Crusted Tofu, which is a sandwich!  And it was REALLY good and a big serving.  It came with fries and the Tavern Slaw which was simple but yummy.  Others with me had the Fish & Chips (pan fried) and Pulled Lamb.  Overall, the food was delicious.  No dessert was ordered because we were all stuffed.  I hope the same staff is at the door when I go back next time.  Extra points if he remembers me."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the Vegan Butter Lettuce Wraps. The tofu was rich and flavorful, and it came with pico de gallo and guacamole. I will dine here again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for a date night during winterlicious 2016. Started off at the bar as our table wasn't ready for our reservation. Great selection of single malts I think the waiter said that they had over 100 types. But be prepared to pay as I thought the scotch prices were a little high. We had a bourbon flight as well and it was delicious.  The food was great. My wife had the poutine which was amazing, and the steak frites which was average and the chocolate cake which she said was kind of like a McCain deep n delicious. I had the ribs which were tasty and the game sausage which had alot of flavor. I then had the ice cream salted caramel cookie desert and it again was delicious.  Friendly staff, great atmosphere, and good scotch."}
{"text":"I came here twice for summerlicious because it was that good.   The first time I went I had the duck buns, which were amazing considering the fact that it's usually an asian specialty. The bun was soft and the sauce was comparable to the type you'd get when eating peking duck. I thought they could've taken it a bit easy on the sauce as it over powered the flavour of the duck, but no complaints as I thought it was still delicious. My friend had the Tuna Tartare, which I tried and swore I had to get it the next time I went (in which I did). The tuna tartare was placed on top of what seems like a large nacho chip, and when you put all the ingredients (tuna and the radish) on the chip and eat it together, it was almost heavenly. The crunchiness of the chip and the softness of the tuna matched so well together.  For the main, I had the ahi tuna burger, the first time I got it medium rare but I found it not rare enough for my tasting, so the second time around I got it rare. Both were equally delicious and perfectly seared. The guac in the burger gave it more of a kick, and the hint of lemon seared into the tuna made it that much better. The frites were also really yummy as they were crispy and full of flavour.   The dessert was a little lack luster though, compared to the appetizer and the main. I had the blueberry pie which was good but would've been better if it was paired with ice cream. However, the pie would be perfect for those who do not like their dessert to be overly sweet. My friend had the ice cream on brownie in which the brownie could easily be compared to a brick as it was really hard to cut into. It, however, did not taste nor feel like a piece of brick when eating it. Still, the brownie could've been more moist, that was the only downside of the entire meal.   Overall, I really enjoyed it and the atmosphere was nice and the waitress/waiters were super friendly. Would definitely go for a third time around."}
{"text":"We ordered the burger and tavern salad.The burger was on a plain doughy white bread bun, the salad was the Museum salad, neither my husband or enjoyed it. The service was fine, they did take the salad off the bill. But we didn't feel it's worth another try. very disappointing lunch."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly, this is a great date spot. It's a bit hidden from view, or it could be that I had already had a cocktail at the Oxely just before heading over to the Museum Tavern for dinner. Our server was friendly and knew the menu inside and out and could easily advise on which items this lactard/glutard could eat.   Oysters:  briney and perfect. Mains: we ordered two appetizers which were the perfect size to share. The white fish tostadas may just be the best thing I've had at a restaurant in 2013.  Cocktails: Smart cocktails made with care. Corner booth: perfect for a cosy chat.  Really, really good food."}
{"text":"Museum Tavern is a recently-opened establishment, aptly named as it provides a view over the Royal Ontario Museum across Bloor Street.   There is a small semi-covered patio, that would have been lovely on a warm summers day, but on the day of my visit, it was pouring rain, so inside we went. The interior has an upscale European tavern feel to it, with a separate bar and view into the back kitchen. It is fairly intimate, with perhaps no more than 10-15 tables in the main dining area (excluding the patio).  The menu features a number of starters (small plates) that are perfect to share among two people, but no more. Though the price is in-line with, some of their entrées, it would not be recommended to skip over these items. On the day of my visit, my friend and I ordered the absolutely divine tuna poke cones. These were faultless: stuffed with fresh tuna tartare, kicked up with a light srirarcha mayo, which did not overpower the tuna, and fresh avocado, placed into delicate wafer-thin cones, not fragile enough to break after one or two bites.   I was now anticipating my meal more than I had prior to arrival. To compliment the pub atmosphere, I ordered a turkey confit torpedo (sandwich) with a side of fries. Though the fries were not piping hot, they were properly seasoned (read, not overly salty). I had requested mayo for my french fries, my usual modus operandi for fries, but our server recommended a tomatillo-infused mayo rather than the standard Hellman's I was expecting. What a perfect, albeit unusual recommendation. I found myself devouring the french fries and had nearly forgotten my sandwich!  The turkey confit torpedo sandwich was good, but not amazing. Perhaps my addiction to the tomatillo mayo and french fries was at fault, by the time I took the first bite the confit was trending on cold. The gruyère cheese might have fared better if it were fully melted prior to serving, rather than having it melt on the warm confit. Nevertheless, the soft baguette upon which it was served allowed me to still enjoy. One of my pet peeves at many establishments these days is the use of stale, or overly-hardened baguettes. I prefer a soft bun accompanying ingredients such as cooked meat.  The one thing I did not appreciate was a $3 refill charge on my diet coke, which was fountain soda. This is an egregious charge, but not out of the ordinary in the Yorkville area, so I let it slide.   In sum, service was outstanding, with regular water re-fills, and frequent attendance (though it should be noted that this was a late afternoon visit, and it was not busy). Museum Tavern is an excellent addition to the area, though next time I hope to catch the sun so I can enjoy my meal outdoors overlooking Bloor and the ROM!"}
{"text":"The ad in the back of a Koerner Hall concert programme piqued my interest about this place, and one Saturday we arrived early enough before another concert to grab a bite. Being late afternoon on a Saturday they were busy but we were able to sit at the bar. This is a belated review so I don't recall the beer selection, but it was pretty good. We started with elk sliders (with cheese and double-smoked bacon - yum), I had the house made game sausage (elk, lamb and boar) which was rich and awesome and went well with the spaetzle (a bed of noodly bits with caramelized onions and spinach), and the bf had the sticky maple ribs which were set in a tangy, almost Thai sort of chili sauce that complemented the sweetness of the ribs. My only complaint about the food is a personal taste sort of thing: I feel like small crispy fried onions added last would have lent a better texture to the spaetzle. But maybe that's just how it's supposed to be!  Great food aside, I have to mention the service. It was very busy, and the bartenders were also servers, but they were phenomenal. Quick, accurate, attentive without being intrusive, and intuitive, which is the difference between good and great service. As I said, my boyfriend had the ribs, and when he was almost done the other bartender who wasn't even our server came over with a warm damp towel and lemon wedges so that he could clean his fingers well. Neither of us had ever had a server go just a little bit above and beyond like that, and it was very much appreciated. We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Mediocre service!!! They made a mistake on my orders d was very reluctant to own up for the mistake. For this reason I'll never go back, it's not like  the food is amazing anyway!"}
{"text":"Had a full sit down dinner with 2 others and found the food over priced and bland, the drinks were great and perhaps we should have just gone for cocktails, the crab cake was gross, the lobster roll had a delicious bun but was bland and the ribs were fatty and bland.  The star of the night was the Komomoto Oysters."}
{"text":"I decided to check out their burger after being rated the best burger in town by a blogger who ate a burger everyday in 2016.  It didn't disappoint.  It's rather expensive - $18 for a small burger with fries, but it is full of flavor.  The only thing keep me from calling it the best I've had is that the combination of the medium cooked beef, cheese and the sauce made the burger too rich and unctuous without enough balance of something fresh and zesty.  This might be, however, because I asked mine without onions, so it only had the patty, sauce, cheese, tiny bit of lettuce, and a small slice of pickle.  I think it would have benefitted from having a slice of tomato, which it doesn't come with.  Once I got over that it was almost all grease and protein, however, I really enjoyed the flavor.  It's like the richer cousin of the Big Mac that's better in every way.  I'd like to go back, but the price is hefty for what it is, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"I've been to Museum Tavern a couple of times.  However, after these visits I do not think I will return again.   The service itself is great but the servers are a bit in their own world.  Especially sitting next to the service station, the  conversations i have overheard were quite shocking! Please! We are trying to eat food!  Once, I even witnessed a manager coming up to a waitress and scolding her on something quite trivial... please do your dirty work in the back of the restaurant where your guests are not trying to enjoy their food.   The food and the drinks are quite impressive and if you are looking to self indulge.. this is a good place.  However, it is quite overpriced and with the environment being tainted by sheer unprofessionalism, there are a lot better places to eat in Toronto."}
{"text":"Needed to find a rooftop patio that was covered when weather forecasted humidity and thunderstorms. No waiting when we got there for early afternoon.   I ordered the PEI mussels and fries which were accompanied with a side of spinach salad. I was a bit stuffed from late breakfast so opted for Negronis over a beer. The server indicated the ingredients for cocktails were kept in house and aged quite nicely. The Negroni captured the flavour beautifully.The mussels had a kind of spice which gave it a perfect kick  (steamed in a ceramic bowl). Fries were seasoned well and reminded me of Swiss Chalet fries. Spinach salad was bland.   They have different deserts everyday that aren't found on the menu, but the server remembered them explicitly. My friend had a cookie dough ice cream with a cookie which was fairly inexpensive and I had a flourless chocolate cake  which was quite bland and I couldn't finish it. Wouldn't recommend the cake to anyone.   Only the inner tables were safe from the prevailing rain that was coming down but luckily they were available for us to switch seats. Highly recommendable for a rainy weekend if you can get seats!"}
{"text":"4/5! Great places to go for drinks. Highly recommend the mint Juleb even if you are not a huge fan of bourbon. We sat on the patio and had the lunch pre-fixe menu. It was a lot of food even though it was indicated the portions would be small. The quinoa salad starter was horrible but the quinoa crusted tofu sandwich and tavern Cobb are good! I would go back for happy hour and $1 oysters!"}
{"text":"Summerlicious 2014 again...  Amazing deal if you're a big eater, because I was full enough for a little shame spiral as we walked back to the car (through Philosopher's Walk across the road, which is nice at night).  Yes it's loud inside, but it really does have a classic feel and it looks exactly like a place where you get steak frites.  Duck bun starters were delicious Sweet and spicy and rich with duck and the buns were perfect and smooshy. I'm pretty sure that's a word, by the way.  My good lady had the fried chicken wings and they were really tasty, although I am not a wing guy. Great dipping sauce and a super crunchy coating.  She then got ribs, because she's like that, and they were excellent, with a spicy sauce once again, and they were clean and Asian in flavour, if you ask me (Thai chilis on top, etc). An enormous upgrade from creepy sports bar ribs with greasy BBQ sauce.  I had an Ahi burger cooked perfectly and, compared to the ribs, much subtler in flavour, obviously.  It was loaded with avocado and and thick and juicy and exactly what I expected. This is a good thing.   Fries were plentiful indeed. We had enough for our kids, had we brought them, and this is the source of the shame spiral. So. Many. Fries.  Dessert was good, but nothing special or interesting - the only reason for 4 stars. It was an ice cream sandwich and it mostly tasted sweet. Stronger chocolate would be better and/or some more interesting flavour of ice cream. My good woman wasn't keen on hers, which was white and tasted that way.  I would certainly come back to eat off the regular menu.  Great food, friendly service and it looks very appealing inside."}
{"text":"Went last night with a group of friends after hearing a lot of positive things and I was more than impressed. The service was amazing, the food impeccable, and the drinks even better.  We shared the white fish tostadas as an appetizer and they were fresh and delicious. My main I had the steak and frites and it was probably one of the best steaks I have had. Very juicy, the sauce was awesome. Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Nothing stellar but nothing awful either.  I've been here a few times and it hits the spot when I'm in the mood.  The decor, ambiance and location keep me coming back.  Drink prices are pretty standard, food prices are slightly above average for slightly above average food."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Probably the best mussles I've had in a long time.   Jerk mussels sauce was great and could have eaten it as a soup.  Lobster role, Flat Iron Steak, Poutine all very good and I thought reasonable.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I fell in in love with museum tavern! This restaurant is bustling with enlightening vibe, which was just what we needed on a cold gloomy rainy winter evening. Diner style and bistro-like ambiance make it a hip spot for students, casual dinners with friends and lovebirds on date.   We ordered and shared lobster roll, elk slider, fish and chips and mussels. They were all delicious, plus they were cooked so uniquely you won't find anything like them in the city. We especially loved lobster rolls as they tasted really fresh. Fish and chips was one of the best I've had in UT area but it was pricey. The foods overrall were a bit pricey for our stuednt budget but we thought it was worth it because they were so tasty and different from foods we get at other restaurants. The drinks were good, we ended up ordering more cocktails than we should have.  I wanted to give 5 stars but there are some issues working against it. We had to wait for almost half an hour to get in. And the restaurant was so cold! We had to wear jackets inside. And our foods came out slower than the table next to us even though we were seated a lot earlier.   But despite such shortcomings we enjoyed our visit to Museum Tavern, and we are  planning to come back soon for more."}
{"text":"I sit writing this review from guu. Guu you may ask, but this is a review for museum tavern...  Well, after my experience at Museum Tavern, I left hungry and a little aggravated and ventured to guu to get much needed protein into my system.  We went to museum tavern for winterlicious, against a nagging inner better judgement that told me not try out a place for the first time during winterlicious.  Anyway I ordered the tuna tartar for an appetizer and the steak frites for my main. I ordered it medium rare and even made a note to the server for more on the rare side than medium side. Maybe I should have ordered it still mooing because my when my steak came it hardly had any pink at all.    If this wasn't bad enough it took about 5 minutes to get anyone's attention to complain and when I did the server took the plate graciously and apologized. I thought maybe I'd have a new meal in 5-10 minutes or so to get me a new steak. We must have waited about 20 minutes and finally just said to cancel the order and bring us the bill.  My boyfriend was just about done with his meal (which were ribs that were tender but way too sticky) and I really didn't want to wait around anymore for my meal.    The server took my entire meal off the bill, which was what any restaurant should have done. However, my boyfriend and I both saw her approach the manager to explain the situation but instead of coming over to apologize to our table he headed straight to the line and grabbed the steak off of the counter (which I guess had finally been made) and headed to the back staff area to eat it.   Now we are not ones to normally make bad reviews as both my boyfriend and I have worked in the service industry and know that sometimes, quite frankly, shit happens.  We normally just keep our mouths shut and return if we liked it and stay far away if not. But this was just too much. I will not be going back but I also now feel the need to tell other people to know what you're getting into.   Thanks museum tavern but no thanks."}
{"text":"Love this place, one of my favourites in the city. Prices are about 50% more than your average bar but quality and service is a full 100% better so I'm down."}
{"text":"Great happy hour deals on the wine ($5) and oysters ($1) before hitting the ROM and on all weeknights! Although it must be said that the $1 oysters are not the best.. they taste a bit too briny and too much sand.   I usually order the salads which are generous with the toppings.. albeit, you're paying for it with the relatively high prices."}
{"text":"We have just cake and coffee, the coffee was refillable and the taste of their chocolate cake was great, it was one of the best chocolate cake that I had ever"}
{"text":"YUM! Went for Winterlicious. Staff was nice and friendly, didn't feel rushed, food was amazing. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think I'd have to try it sans-Winterlicious to give a final judgement. Had the perogies and the sausage. So good! Regular day prices seemed pretty reasonable too. Great looking restaurant inside as well. Not too big, nicely decorated, warm and cozy. I'd go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Food was ok but really overpriced for lunch. $40 for fish and chips and a small starter - even those with a flush expense account might feel thats a bit much."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my dad, who was staying at the Intercontinental Hotel next door. From outside, it looks more likely to be a student bar, but walking in was a very pleasant surprise: classy without being stuffy, upscale but still casual. It was doing an impressive business for a Tuesday night.  We were here for food, not drinks, and I was very satisfied with the food. The portions were massive, and considering that, the prices were quite reasonable. But definitely come on an empty stomach. I had the PEI Mussels, which were slightly spicy with a thai influence. I wish I could have finished the whole thing, I barely touched the fries that came with it because I was so full! My dad had the pulled lamb sandwich, which he said was a bit runny, but tasty nonetheless.  This is a place I would be happy to bring my family, but could also visit with a group of friends over drinks. Will definitely recommend it next time I'm in the neighbourhood and looking for a nice dinner or drinks place."}
{"text":"Run for your GI tract's life! My pregnant wife and her friend both got the trots from this place. They both ate different things: fish & chips for one and a burger for the other. My wife was so sick she went to the hospital.  It's really too bad because I've heard great things about this place and wanted to try it. Stick to drinking high proof cocktails only here."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend and had a great time.  The space itself is lovely and the service was good... Friendly and fast!  What I ate: Market fish and seasonal vegetables. If I'm remembering correctly it was sea bass with a roasted red pepper sauce and crispy, fried zucchini. The fish was cooked perfectly and the red pepper sauce kept the dish light and fresh. I appreciated the fried veggies for the textural contrast. My friend had the steak salad which she enjoyed and the portion was HUGE. But hey, if you're paying $21 for a salad it had better be...   What I drank: Cave Spring \"Dolomite\" riesling... Always happy to see one of my favourites on the menu. Paired nicely with the fish. Not overly sweet.  Overall a wonderful lunch catching up with a friend. A little on the pricey side but worth it for the great food and service."}
{"text":"As a caveat, I've never eaten here, so I cannot speak with authority about the food, but I have gone there a few times a week over the last 3 months for drinks and have never been disappointed. It's classy. Copper bar and oak kind of place that dry ices the glasses, and rules the cocktail scene in the area. It's not a molecular mixology place, it's the kind of place where you can order an old school cocktail (widow's kiss, last word, gimlet, old fashioned, horse's neck, etc...) and they'll be able to make a perfect one. Plus- they have Mojitos all year round.  When you want to switch to pints, they have some terrific beers on tap that I can't find anywhere else, but enjoy every drop.  The bartenders are ridiculously nice. The regulars are great. It's a fun way to spend a night where you want to go out, but not too far. Unpretentious, but classy- a go to place for an unfailingly great time."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was amazing. We ordered the nachos and even though you only get 8 pieces, they were the tastiest bites ever. Each bite was loaded with guacamole, sour cream, refried beans, cheese and salsa. I ordered the double cheeseburger for my main which melted like butter and my friend ordered the fried chicken sandwich, which she loved. Everything was seasoned well and the flavours complimented one another."}
{"text":"This place won my heart the second I walked in. I'm not sure how they manage to look like a cross between a French bistro and a pub, but they do and it's amazing.   The food is great! I had the tuna burger (I would recommend getting it without the spicy mayo, I think it overpowered the tuna and the guacamole was enough). It was delicious, I'm a sucker for tuna, and this meaty piece was seared perfectly. My BF had the double cheese burger. It was prepared just like a big mac, albeit without the ick factor. It was great, and cooked rare, which is always a bonus.   NOW ONTO THE COCKTAILS. There aren't enough stars on this website to accurately rate how amazing the bartender at this place is. I'm a sucker for a proper margarita and the Old Margarite did not disappoint. I had to use every fiber of my being to not chug it down immediately, my BF exercised the same will power for his amazing Old Fashioned.   The Oak Aged Classics section of the drink menu is the best, most exciting text on a menu I've ever read. I look forward to many more visits, so I can try every single cocktail they have. Also worth mentioning, they have spirit flights!"}
{"text":"Good food and drink. Menu was a bit small but both items we choose were delicious. My first beer was served a bit warm but the second was very cold as it should be. Server was attentive. Desert menu is ever hanging and very fresh.  A Bit pricey and slightly more upscale than you would expect in a college neighborhood. All in all, a good night out."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant!  They make the best manhattans in town and their food is incredible.  The fried chicken sandwich and fish and chips really stand out as stellar dishes.  The service is impeccable and they were very accommodating to our two little ones who are under a year old.  All this with fantastic decor makes this one of my favourite places in the city."}
{"text":"Best whisky/brandy cocktails in the city! Real thought is put into the alcohol choices, and they are masterfully prepared with care. Their Cardinal Sin (jacked up version of a sidecar) was excellent with many more layers of flavour than your standard sidecar, and you can definitely taste the oak in the oak-aged whisky classic.  The food is also top-notch. Duck confit on steamed bao was terrific...tasty with some crunch. The beef short-rib dip is EXCEPTIONAL...definitely 3 or 4 steps up from your 'standard' beef dip. Meat falls apart and is incredibly juicy.   Great setting and atmosphere too...classy without being pretentious or over-the-top fancy."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian I loved their variety and the location was superb. I wasn't a fan of the service to be honest and the description of the desserts didn't match. However, food and drinks were excellent."}
{"text":"Overall a very solid Winterlicious experience. The service was incredibly fast - our appetizers arrived within minutes of ordering. The vegan soup was tasty, a little spicy, but luke warm. I had the fish and chips entree - the fish was buttery and flaky on the inside and nice and crispy on the outside, and came with a generous portion of fries. The ice cream/cookie was a simple dessert, nothing special - I suspect the cookie was not baked in house. But at $25 you can't beat the deal!"}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious. Overall has pretty good pub food. I got the rib ends and my bf for the poutine to start. The rib ends lacked flavour and was very fatty. The poutine on the other hand had real curds and was tasty. For mains, I got the game sausage. It was VERY gamey. If you're not into that kind of flavour, I won't recommend it. It was just one sausage with fries and coleslaw so I was slightly disappointed. He got the fried chicken burger and it was good. It's a large piece of chicken breast, seasoned well, with a bit of a kick. For dessert, we got the vanilla cake and the frozen custard. The custard was liek ice cream, I wasn't expecting that, but it was tasty. The vanilla cake was very tiny....."}
{"text":"I went to Museum Tavern last night for summerlicious and was really disappointed.  Service: 2/5 When we arrived we asked if there was space on the patio and we were told that there was not, and everyone on the patio just arrived so he wasn't anticipating that there would be space any time soon.  So we took a seat inside only to find 2 groups had left the patio 10 minutes later.  We would have waited for a patio seat if we had the option as it was a lovely night.    When we were greeted by our waiter he told us that we could only order off the summerlicious menu.  But throughout the night, we saw many people ordering burgers (that were not on the summerlicious menu), so I'm not sure why everyone other than us could order off the regular menu...?  Food: 2/5 I had the buttermilk fried chicken as an appetizer and it was good.  My food rating would have been 1 if not for the appetizer.  My boyfriend got the duck buns and said my appetizer was better.  The main course was the maple baby back ribs.  I was looking forward to these all day and was very disappointed.  They were way too spicy and not cooked very well.  Ribs should be falling off the bone if cooked properly - these definitely were not! There was also no plate for the bones or wet naps for us - but that has nothing to do with the food, but more to do with the service.  For dessert I had the brownie ice cream cake and my boyfriend had blue berry pie.  The pie had no taste and was infinitely better than my cake.  The brownie part was so hard that I couldn't cut into it with my spoon.  After two bites (my b/f had to cut it for me!) I decided it wasn't worth the effort - and thereby made history, as it was the first time I've EVER declined a dessert!  Other: The restaurant was nice inside but not nice enough for me to return."}
{"text":"We went here for New Years Eve dinner celebrations and were very pleased with the ambiance, the food and the service. The place wasn't super crowded and the seating isn't congested like other places that we've been to.   Our server Lila was super helpful in helping us decide and giving us recommendations on what to order.   Drinks - We started off with their barrel aged cocktails, both the old fashioned and the negroni were well made. They also have Blanche De Chambly - one of my favourite beers!   Food - We shared a bunch of starters and a main course.  Buttermilk Fried Chicken - 5/5 - Super Delicious and must order   White Fish Tostadas - 4/5 - Quite good flavour and texture  Duck Buns - 5/5 - Must order!  We also split the Steak and Fries - The steak was very flavourful and juicy. The fries were drenched in a steak gravy which made them taste even better :) We asked for a side of the steak gravy (it was that good!) but weren't served a side of something that looked like poutine gravy.  Nevertheless, great experience and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a bite and drinks.   Good comfort food. Very consistent. Roughly ~$15 per entree.  Drinks are awesome but a tad pricey.   Really fun place to go to.  Ps it's across on bloor from the ROM- NOT inside the ROM. Don't look like an idiot like me lol"}
{"text":"Didn't know about the negative reviews, but dinner here all three times have been amazing. The lamb sandwich, burger, and ribs, as well as pasta have all been stellar. The portions are sizeable, filling, and will leave you satisfied."}
{"text":"C'est super, on avait très bien mangé entre amis puis... on nous a virés car, tenez-vous bien : \"nous avons des réservations pour 17h00, pouvez-vous libérer les tables?\" - Il était 16h50 et nous avions plus ou moins terminé ..."}
{"text":"2 of us popped in for lunch. Sat on the terrace. Nice view of the ROM entrance. Duck buns, steak frites and a large salad. Good food and service."}
{"text":"I ordered the double cheeseburger that others have described as being one of the best they've had. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. I received a soggy mess that I had to finish with a fork and knife. The patties had practically no sear, and tasted like they were steamed. To make matters worse, it was underseasoned. The fries were nothing to write home about, but unlike the burger, they were inoffensive. While the wait staff were friendly, service was very slow. I was already regretting visiting when I was greeted by the dated decor, and frankly, that should've given me enough of a clue about this place. The over twenty dollars spent on the meal was far from worth it."}
{"text":"Drinks can be a bit hit and miss but the food menu overall is pretty consistent. The salads and the fried chicken sandwich are standouts! Lovely decor and the service here is always great and friendly"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place more: it's got an interesting, classic interior, comfort food that's dressed up, and is close to home, but unfortunately, I'm not a huge fan.  It might be because I've come here twice around closing time (e.g. 11pm on a weekday) despite the website saying they are 'open late.' The drinks have been good but the food has been mediocre. This is not the spot for a late night bite as the kitchen closes at 11pm on weeknights.  The last time I came I ordered the Braised Short Rib Poutine. It came out lukewarm with large chunks of cheese-curds that had minimally melted. For $16, I want a serious poutine - and this didn't come close.  This place needs to step up its food game and/or provide better value for its above-average prices."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this establishment since they opened and all of my experiences have been wonderful. From large parties of 8 to small casual meet ups of 2 - every experience has been consistent. My most recent visit was with a close friend of mine who wanted to try out the new Summerlicious Lunch menu.   We both ordered the salad as an entree. She had the duck salad while I had the steak salad. The portion size was small but enough - filling and delicious. Even though it was the lunch size salad, there was plenty of meat in both of our plates! The salads do not get enough attention here! It's simply delightful.   We finished with the lychee sorbet, which wasn't too sweet, so we both enjoyed it. The presentation of it was not so great but I don't see that as a reason to get upset over. Overall, a pleasurable experience. I will always be happy to return."}
{"text":"Food here really is great (although somewhat pricey).  They have quality beers.  Everyone I went with had cocktails, which looked really good.  The starters are excellent and large - this is a good place for having small plates with multiple people.  Just order one of every starter and split them."}
{"text":"Like others have said, this reminds me of  La Societe, but with a more of a pub feel. It's small, so a reservation is probably necessary. I was here for Winterlicious which isn't really a good gauge of how busy a place is, I know.  No big complaints, but for the dessert. It was a definite after thought or add on on the whole Winterlicious experience. After such nice presentation of everything else, the dessert was just dropped on the plate. A minor detail though, not enough to detract from my overall experience of the place."}
{"text":"We recently went here for Summerlicious and let me tell you - the food was delicious, and the service was even better! Not once was my water glass empty! (That is a huge bonus for me). Duck buns were magical, steak cooked to perfection.  Great atmosphere as well. Felt very welcomed and the entire staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Just went to the Museum Tavern for the first time and must say I'm impressed.  Nice old-timey bar feel (kind of reminds me of the bar from Cheers, but classier) without being fake of kitschy.  Menu features classic cocktails like the Old Fashioned, Manhattan and Sazerac so bonus points there.  All prepared and served perfectly.  The place won't be confused with a sports bar either, as it has only one TV, the smallest TV you'll ever see in a bar, some old 5\" CRT TV complete with channel dials (amazing).   The food is superb. I had the double cheeseburger with American cheese and it was up there with the best burger I've had - at least equalling Burgers Priest. Beautifully cooked medium (thank you!), flat top patties  loaded with flavour and amazingly juicy without being too sloppy to eat.  Topped with a pickle and some great house made sauce. Fries were equally epic, also among the best I've had.  Service was excellent; all the staff were super friendly. No problems splitting the cheque at the end of the night either which I wish was true everywhere.   All in all this place is great and can't recommend it enough. Not cheap, but it delivers on all fronts so easily worth the few extra bucks."}
{"text":"A great spot for a special dinner, conveniently located between Bay and St. George subway stations. I had the steak and it was perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Prices are on the expensive side, but this is to be expected from an upmarket bar/restaurant like Museum Tavern.  My friend had the tuna burger which was really good, but came too raw for our liking. They took it back without complaint, and it was more our fault for not ordering it more well done to start with.  The drinks from the bar look amazing and I will be sure to try an old fashioned the next time I go, based on the other reviews."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of ten for drinks the other night as it was my birthday. The waiter kept telling us not to switch seats or get up and chat as it would affect our bills. I've never heard of this in my life - most places just give separate bills and then bring them to the table and the diners hand each other their respective bills.  My friends also offered to purchase my drinks for me since it was my birthday. This was before the bills were drafted up. The waiter told them that they couldn't and could only pay their own bills. This was annoying as my friends felt bad that they could not do this for me on my birthday. Again, I've never heard of this in my life.  When we were getting ready to leave, the system showed that three drinks (that belonged to a friend that already left) were outstanding and the waiter told us we would have to pay for these drinks. I asked him if my friends had paid before they left (they are NOT the type to walk out on a bill), and he said yes. He then said that my friends must not have told him the correct number of drinks that they had. Shouldn't their system keep track of that? Anyways, it turns out that it was a glitch in their system and we weren't charged. I was just annoyed that I would have had to pay for $40 worth of drinks that were already paid for.  The cocktails were good, but the conundrum of the service was a bit of a headache for me. Not sure if I'd come back for anything more than dinner or drinks for two - they didn't seem to be equipped to handle bigger groups and their system seemed outdated."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is pretty live here.. Hubby and I walked in with no reservation and were lucky enough that someone was a no show so we got a table. The crowd seemed to be a much older crowed (ie all seniors) but didn't bother us.. We ordered the buttermilk chicken sandwich and the beef sandwich both with fries. Food was great but their fries were over salted... Table next to us also commented the same...over all I would go back again."}
{"text":"I might know nothing about Museums, but I'm all up in the taverns. Love this place. They have cheap wine from 4-6, AND their cheeseburger tastes like a BIG MAC! But a Big Mac that won't give you diarrhea, cuz it's made with fresh ingredients and care. Truly delish. Great bartenders. Private bathrooms, in case you don't like people seeing your feet when you pee. Oh and you might find me there, writing and over indulging on all the free popcorn at the bar."}
{"text":"I finally made it! When a girlfriend wanted to meet up for drinks, I mentioned Museum Tavern as a place to try so we braved the cold to get there.  I arrived first and the place is easy to find. On the second floor, the inside is quite small, but it has a great French pub feel. I was immediately greeted by two waiters who promptly seated me by a cute corner, round table for two. While I was waiting for my gf to arrive, I ordered a 9oz Valpolicella as I am not a cocktail drinker, but boy if you are, there are plenty.  Food was really yummy. Our waiter asked if it was our first times here and proceeded to explain the menu and offer suggestions. We ordered the White Fish Tostada for apps which was a spicy beginning to our evening. My gf had a salad which was HUGE - This place wants to make sure you're full, even on leaves. I opted for something meatier so the Steak and Fries was my dish. The tavern sauce was delish and those fries...yummmmm!  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this place and it did not disappoint. The food, drinks, atmosphere and service were all up to par. I am definitely a fan and there is a (smallish) patio! I'm not sure if it's a patio with sun, but I guess I will have to come back and find out"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of pub food, and I would say Museum Tavern is on the higher end when it comes to quality of food. The food was delicious. I ordered the Creole crab cake, Buttermilk Fried Chicken burger & a White Chocolate Crème Brûlée. The portion size was decent, I could barely order dessert after the main (but there's always room for dessert!).   I would say it was pretty crowded and loud for Thursday night, I could barely hear my friends across the table. The wait for the food was also longer than average.   All in all, if you're looking for pub food near Yorkville, give this place a shot. Just be ready to accept a loud environment."}
{"text":"Came here based on a blogger who tried a burger a day for a year and Museum Tarvern landed in top 3. And boy oh boy was the burger delicious! Prime rib double patty with melted cheese in between soft (egg?) buns. At our table, we also ordered the buttermilk fried chicken (it's okay), perogies (bacon + mushrooms, what's there not to love), and the ahi tuna burger (damn! It was a thick cut - I'm definitely getting it next time)."}
{"text":"they will not serve black people. I sat at table and watched four different parties who came in after me, without reservations,  get served. I asked both the host and the bartender how I could get some help. I was told to wait and someone would get to me............"}
{"text":"Food 3/5 (50% of final grade) Generally, the food was the typical savoury, semi-fancy type of placement and taste. The above-average score is awarded to their surprisingly refreshing-yet-filling Mexican Street Corn Salad and Aztec Bowl. The cooked kale that they paired their Albacore Tune Ceviche with was also very yum. The portions were perfect, if not erring on the larger side. Unfortunately, they sold out of their Potted Cheesecake by the time we went, but the other two desserts were at-par at best.   Ambiance 3.5/5 (15% of final grade) The light was awkwardly maroon-tinged and right in that weird zone between romantic-dark and casual-light, but it was really cute how they had candles delicately placed on the tables. The general atmosphere was dimmed and pub-like, but with a tinge of class. The establishment felt clean and comfortable. They also have a patio, which would have been nice, if not for the fact that it was incredibly windy that day. The ambiance in general is great for both dates and small groups.   Service 3.5/5 (15% of final grade) We were promptly served once we arrived, but there was a lady waitress that gave off a very non-reactive vibe, as if she didn't really want to be there but she had to pretend to be friendly. BUT the main waiter who served my girl trio was a gentleman who was very friendly, and told us when he had to go on break, at which time another gentleman came to introduce himself and happily took our requests. I asked this gentleman about the oil content in the Aztec Bowl I was eating, and he gave me a rough estimate, but didn't seem completely comfortable with the information he was giving (so product knowledge wasn't the greatest). There were times when we had to request for our water to be filled, which, I think, for a restaurant of that perceived hype should  not need to happen. However, the gentlemen were always compliant to our requests, which was nice of them. I wish they could have said goodbye when we left the place after paying though, 'cause it's always awkward waddling out of a quiet food place after paying without any of the servers acknowledging you.  Cost 2.5/5 (10% of final grade) The three-course dinner was $38 + tax + tip. For their service I gave a 20% tip, which resulted in my dinner costing a little less than $60 in total. Perhaps it was because of Summerlicious, but I didn't really feel that the quality of the food was especially valuable for the price. After-all, it is downtown, so I could have found something around the same price and slightly higher quality.  Other 4/5 (10% of final grade) I only wanted the Potted Cheesecake for dessert, so I requested to order the dessert later, so that I could have the time to think about whether to order the Chocolate Tart or the House Ice Cream, because our server said that they didn't have anything else. When we were finished with our entrees, the gentleman came over and asked me whether or not I would settle for créme brulée instead, despite it not being on the Summerlicious menu. This was a very nice gesture, I felt, especially because I would have definitely settled for one of the other two ultimately if I wasn't given this option. It was truly very considerate of him to check with the kitchen!! The créme brulée ended up being ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS in that the custard had a tinge of milk tea to its delicate taste. YUM!  Final Grade = 64/100 = 3 Stars  TLDR: Cute place. Didn't make too much of an impression though, if not for the créme brulée, but that might just be me, 'cause I LOVE CREME BRULEE."}
{"text":"The server was v personable but I didn't like the cocktail I ordered cause they don't have coolers and the nachos we ordered were really bad. Too cheesy not enough jalapeños. And the chips were homemade but nothing special. And there were 8 of them which the server did warn us about. The balcony is great though especially after a 4 hour tour of the ROM."}
{"text":"Petite perle cachée au sommet d'un escalier juste en face du ROM, le Museum Tavern vous plonge dans une atmosphère entre brasserie parisienne et pub british authentique. Asseyez-vous au bar tout en inox et admirez l'assortiment de bouteilles disposées stratégiquement sur les étagères. Le Barman vous recommandera les derniers cocktails de sa création et vous aurez même droit au spectacle avec l'azote liquide (rassurez vous aucun risque d'engelure). Les tables en salle sont très bien présentées, je n'ai pas eu l'occasion de goûter leur plats, à refaire bien évidemment!  // Little gem hidden on top of a staircase just in front of the ROM, the museum tavern is a mix between parisian brasserie and a british pub. Sit a the bar and just admire all the bottles on the shelves. The bartender will recommand all the last cocktails and you will even have the little show with the liquid azote (don't worry it's safe). Tables are very well placed, did not have the chance to taste the menu but I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We visited the Museum Tavern last night and had a fantastic time - It was my husband and I's anniversary and I had passed by this place a million times when I was a U of T student, always wanting to try it.   We were given a nice little corner booth, which allowed us to have an intimate experience. The servers were all very approachable and professional. I had the Aztec Bowl, which was DELICIOUS and a very well-balanced meal. My husband had the Short Rib French Dip, which was one of the best he's ever had. The ambiance is very cozy, and clearly a lot of thought was out into the decor. We kept noticing little accents reminiscent of the 1930's and gave us all kinds of ideas for decorating our own home!   The only things we were disappointed in were that the service was a tad too slow for our liking. We had to wait a long time for a refresher on our drinks, and for the bill at the end of the night. Given that it's more expensive than your average place, I expect that to be reflected in the service. Also, the Cider selection (if you're a fan, like me) was inadequate. They only had Waupoos, which I find too sweet and light.   Besides those two small issues, we had a great time and will definitely return! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on our last night of our mini vacation.  This was by far the best restaurant we at at during our long weekend.  I had the spicy sticky maple ribs.  The ribs were absolutely amazing.  I've never ordered anything like this before so I was a bit scared.  I paired it with a Sryah/Shiraz and it was a beautiful combination.  The portion was just right.  It came with French fries and cole slaw.  These were delicious too.  I hate cole slaw, but tried it since it wasn't mayo based.  I actually ate a couple bites because it was tasty.    The desert menu was all homemade.  The waiter brought us a huge piece of pecan pie.  It was so big we both decided to order a second glass of wine.    My boyfriend ordered the wild game sausage and spatzel.  This was super tasty too.  We both really enjoyed our meals and the atmosphere.  The atmosphere is an upscale place, with lots of brass and almost a library feel with the deep wood tones.  I can't wait to go back the next time we are in Toronto."}
{"text":"Eine sensationelle Bar in der Nähe der Universität im schicken Ausgeh-Viertel von Toronto. Der Barkeeper war einer von der \"alten Schule\" und mixte uns einige Raritäten. Ich kenne nicht viele Lokale mit besserem Barkeeper. Interessant war, dass selbst am Nachmittag um 17 Uhr halbwegs viele Leute in der Bar waren. Man kommt sofort ins Gespräch und kann sich auf einen schönen Abend vorbereiten.  Nett!"}
{"text":"I loved the experience! The environment seems like a Great Gatsby place, not too big, wich for me is good. The food is very delicious and different in a good way!"}
{"text":"Terrible service - 7 of us came into the establishment and problems started from this:   1)hostess could not seem to count and showed us to a table of 6   2)waiter managed to forget (or ignore) orders of not one, but two members of our party not only once, but twice   3)waiter refused to acknowledge the forgotten orders and simply said \"you didn't order it\" - upon further confrontation he said \"if you say so, whatever\" - extremely disappointing attitude.   4)overcharged us on our bills - had 4 orders of the duck buns but we were charged 0.6 portions each - 0.6*7 = 4.2  Overall extremely dissatisfied and disappointed by the service."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best appetizer menu south of St.Clair, happy hour daily, very attractive staff (souls of course), top shelf selections and talented bar men who can produce masterful \"off-list\" requests without looking in a book or reference.  Exceptional."}
{"text":"Folks having  finally dined here now so here is an update. Having been impressed by the high standard for drinks here I thought it would be a nice start before painting the town red.  My dinning companions are health conscious when it comes to food so they were looking for healthier option,  I had checked the menu before hand and saw some suitable options for them. I wanted to eat something light but at a loss for choices. Anyway after a bit of deliberation my friends ordered Tofu with Quinoa and I ordered a short rib sandwich. The service is still immaculate and the drinks don't disappoint (though they didn't have maudite on tap anymore)  Sandwiches were quite poor the tofu was deep friend and had crumbly texture (deep fried not mentioned on the menu) and the bread was quite poor and kinda settles in your stomach (not in a good way). Short Rib sandwich was a similar poor iteration. Meat though tender was slathered with sauce that was not balanced and had overly sweet finish. I became lethargic after this supposedly light sandwich option.  The food needs to improve here as I didn't pay much attention to it on the last visit and only tried a snack or two. 2 Stars for the food here. Now on to the drinks we decided to stick to cocktails this time and ordered a round of Autumn's Rest. A nice balanced light drink. For seconds a round of Fire & Ice did the trick. This is more of a  creative drink and the list of ingredients is baffling. Somehow it all comes together the top is caramelized and has a more marshmallow like finish.  Hmm more on the sweet side.  This place is still top notch for drinks IMO though I would advise against dinning here."}
{"text":"This is just the kind of tavern/pub/bar that Bloor Street needs.  As others have stated, the decor is quite classy without seeming cheesy. The little patio over Bloor looks great as well. Overall, a great ambiance in here.  I had the double hamburger, and it was sublime. The beef was tender and juicy and all the topics were top quality. You pay a few dollars more per main here than at one of the chain pubs, but it's still great value. Generous portion sizes and lots of fries too!  There's a good selection of beer, and it looks like some mean cocktails as well.  The service was excellent, and I was quite impressed with this tavern."}
{"text":"The steak tartar was very good and fish and chips very tasty. Courteous staff. Great service. Loved it."}
{"text":"This a very solid location to go to when in the dt core. Such a nice and intimate atmosphere, with a very classic old fashioned bar look to it with old wood paneling and various booths for seating. Pricing is pretty standard for various drinks. Although they have a very good selection of alcohols and mixed drinks."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was also great. Would come back on. My entire family enjoyed the food. We got to sit out on the patio in the evening."}
{"text":"Great time there today.  Sat on the patio, didn't have to wait for a table, in the shade.  Service was maybe a tad slow, but not without polite apologies if any was actually needed.  Good lunch options, everything sounded appealing in one way or another, but I settled on the prime rib sandwich.  It was so good, definitely a good call.  Not crazy prices, given the location.  I'll be back to sit on the patio again!"}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise! Where once there was a dank burrito joint there now is a classy bistro style restaurant with a highly intriguing cocktail list and creative culinary offerings (elk burger anyone? I guess that's Canadian).   Prices are in keeping with the Yorkville presence and it will be a nice place to take guests staying at the local luxury hotels. They have something rare on Bloor street; a patio that keeps you far away from the panhandling masses. While we wait for the government to commit to affordable housing, I guess this will have to do. Also rare on Bloor street; restrooms that don't make you want to hold it until you can get home.  Stop by while the weather is warm so you can sip a watermelon mojito and enjoy the view of Philosopher's Walk."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior decor with chequered floors and burgundy leather seating, and delicious food to match. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place for quite a while as the menu sounded really good and the reviews have for the most part been quite positive.   We ate here on Sunday night and did not have a good experience at all. My friends and I are relatively low maintenance and are very understanding as we have worked in the service industry before.   The service was very slow and the food was mediocre at best.  Here are some quick points:   - Restaurant was not very busy. Maybe 6 tables in total.    - Drinks took 15 minutes to get to our table and that is not an exaggeration. We ordered 3 pints and 1 cocktail. Not sure why it took as long as it did.     - Crab cakes were really fishy, kind of tasted like they were on the brink of going bad. We sent the crab cakes back and they did take the item off the bill.    - They delivered 3 out of 4 entrees. We had to wait 10 mins for the last entree to come out, which we would have understood if they let us know there was a delay on the last entree. We overheard a conversation between the server and the kitchen and they had forgotten the last entree. No one communicated this to us and the only way we knew was based on the fact that we overheard what was being said between our server and the kitchen.    - When the last entree was ready, the manager did come over and deliver the last entree. He apologized for the wait on the food but quickly left the table.    - Our server did offer one dessert for our table of 4, for the delays we expereienced. He let us know that the choice was a crumble and 4 choices of ice creams. He did list off what the ice creams were but did not tell us what flavour the crumble was. We declined the offer as we did not want to wait any longer or be in the restaurant any more at that point.    Not sure if this was just bad luck on our part in terms of the poor service we recieved. I usually give any establishment two visits before I decide if I will return or not but seeing as the food was just meh and the service was so slow, I don't think I need a second visit."}
{"text":"A great lunch time spot on the second floor of the building.  Gets rammed fairly quickly firing the lunch hours. I'd highly recommend their famous house burger or their buttermilk fried chicken sandwich (a tiny bit spicy with their jalapeno slaw and adobe mayo, but so good!). Both comes with fries which are delicious as well. Surrounding businesses definitely use this place a lot for business lunch meetings.   They also have a sizeable patio that's great for people watching over Bloor street in the summer."}
{"text":"This will be a short and bitter review. We arrived at Museum Tavern at 9.30pm on a Thursday night, we were greeted by a nice man who seated us on the patio. We were served by a very nice girl who maybe wasn't trained very well.  We ordered the Steak Tartare to share and the wife ordered a Salad and I ordered the prime rib dip. The tartare never got to the table, just the mains were brought, shame I was looking forward to it.   Mains were good, the food was really nice.   Server didn't check back on us, so I had no beer for my entree.  We ordered the shortcake for dessert and it was like a desert DRY. Take it off the menu!!  Paid the bill and left   Food 7/10 Service 4/10 Drinks 7/10"}
{"text":"Hands-down my favorite restaurant in Toronto. Vegan-friendly for me, so I can come here with my family and have a wonderufl time. i love the ambience. I always order the tofu butter lettuce wraps - they're my favorite. I've also had their vegan main dish (Aztec Bowl) and I ordered the quinoa-crusted tofu sub without any yogurt. The sub was fantastic, although I ignored the bread (white & crusty & slightly stale - a brown bread with more flavor and smaller would have been much better.) As for the fries that came with the sub - I haven't had regular fries in 3 years (I don't really like them) but these ones were so good I ate almost all of them! They were crisp, had a beautiful cut, and weren't overly oily. The Aztec Bowl is absolutely delicious. Between that and the tofu wraps I am a very happy camper."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Toronto. Love the atmosphere, the food, the crowd, the drinks, the friendly barmen, everything gets a 5 star rating except the man host or the door:( he manages to make us feel unwanted every time we come in. But thanks to the lovely staff and specially the gents behind the bar, they manage to make us feel welcomed every time. Thank you"}
{"text":"For the price it's a good choice. Service was pretty quick, drinks were good.  The salad tasted as if it had been prepped long ago and been in the fridge - blah.  The steak & fries were great."}
{"text":"I went to the Tavern on a Sunday afternoon with 2 friends for oysters. Being from Toronto and not a huge fan of the summer- and winterlicious craze, we didn't realize it was that time of the year again.  Once seated, we were told they were not running their normal menu during winterlicious and oysters were not available. The next 15 minutes were spent with us deciding that to eat and with the server coming by every 2 minutes trying to rush us into ordering. Once we've all placed our winterlicious orders, we only saw the server when dropping off food. I had to flag him down a few times to order more drinks.  As for my food, the Brie and pea meal sandwich was so drenched in oil, inside and out, that I had to dry it off with napkins before eating.  All in all, a nice location with an underwhelming service and ok food.  Restaurants agreeing to do winterlicious should keep in mind patrons who do not want to partake and are there for the regular fare."}
{"text":"great drinks menu. unique food menu. I would definitely come back to try more dishes. staff is super friendly and attentive. enjoyed everything I tasted-  tavern chop salad, white fish tostadas, ahi tuna cones, steak tartare, crab cakes. appetizers are served in twos."}
{"text":"Solid spot - The patio is great and service is superb.  The food is A-Ok - nothing special here but you won't be disappointed.  I like the vegetarian options which are not your typical salads or pasta.  It's just one of those consistent and simple restaurants.  They have a nice drink menu.  This spot is a great location and delicious... just don't expect to be wowed off your feet."}
{"text":"They seated us at a perfect L booth so we could talk and see each other. The ambience is wonderful, nice lighting, cozy atmosphere.  They had my friend's (an now my) favourite wine, McManis Cab so we ordered a bottle ($55) it was sublime.  The server was friendly but somewhat inattentive. We noticed a lot of tables were being seated and having orders taken and since we arrived before them, we wanted to ensure our order was placed quickly - we were hungry!  The food was good. We ordered Fish Tostadas (($12) to start came with two so perfect to share. I ordered the buttermilk chicken burger ($17). It seemed unnecessarily hot - like it had been in a deep fryer, or had been sitting under the heat lamp too long. Was delicious and I ate it all! My friend oredered the mussels. She said they were great, but was a bit overwhelmed by the huge amount of fries on the side. I liked her fry dipping sauce, mine didn't come with one.  A great intimate spot. Saw lots of student-like people. A bit pricey for the college crowd, but  was quite busy nonetheless.  We will return."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go here for lunch today, however, the experience was less than stellar.  I had heard rave reviews about the fried buttermilk chicken burger, so both my friend and I ordered it.  The sandwich was dry, (extremely overdone) and scraped the roof of my mouth.  Meanwhile, the bun was soggy and disintegrating faster than I could consume it.  The service was good, however, for a $30 lunch, I expected better.  I could think of a lot of other places I would have rather spent that $30 at.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I came here with my family and we had a good night out. My mom enjoyed her arctic char with lentils and swiss chard. I sampled a little bit of the butcher's bolognese and it was very tasty and quite meaty with elk, wild boar, beef, and lamb. If you like a hearty meal on a cold winter's day, this is the meal to enjoy. I opted for the buttermilk fried chicken burger and it was juicy and crispy, but the sauce wasn't that flavourful. Instead of fries, I requested a salad, which was delicious with arugula, broccoli, and pickled red onions. The dish also came with a small side of satisfying slaw.   For dessert, we shared a peanut butter and chocolate tart and a chocolate mousse cake. The desserts didn't wow me, but I would say the peanut butter and chocolate tart was better than the cake.  The restaurant was warm and inviting and service was good."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, the servers and most of all the food! Went here with a girlfriend for winterlicious and we super enjoyed the ducks buns and ribs as appetizers. Fish and chips and chicken burger was delicious and our vanilla mousse with hints of banana and cookie and ice cream was just a great finishing touch! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"It seems many of the opening kinks have been worked out. Food is similar but service has improved greatly. Will return."}
{"text":"I would give it a zero star if I can just due to the horrifying food poisoning I got! Overpriced pub food. Don't waste your money or health here!"}
{"text":"This was THE worst service I have ever had at a restaurant, including runs to the gas station and to-go sandwiches from the convenience store in college.  I called in earlier that day to make a reservation, but when I showed up my reservation was not even on the calendar. The maitre d' was rude and disinterested (didn't even greet me when I walked in the door, he just stood there disinterestedly until I told him I had a reservation).   But he was nothing compared to our waiter. He was downright rude and nasty the entire evening. He was hard to flag down and even when he was standing there he would stare off into some other place angrily. It was hard to get him to take down our order properly because he was not even listening. He did do a perfunctory check in during our meal, but asked us how the food was and didn't bother to listen. When it came time to pay he tossed down the machine onto our table, gave us some haughty instructions on how to input the price, and walked away. We were finding our way around the machine fine, thank you very much, when he suddenly rushes in, grabs the machine and tells us we are not doing it properly. (It was right). Without an apology he just thrust it back on the table and walked away for us to finish the transaction. As we walked away from our table, he comes chasing after us and grabbed my arm, saying \"You took my copy [of the receipt]!\" I explained that I had left it on the table, and he just turned and walks away with no word, no greeting.   The food was ok, but everything was COVERED in salt. Not worth the $50+ per person we shelled out.   The restaurant's sliver of hope was the kind and attentive busboy. He was literally the only reason we even left a tip.   Long story short, worst service ever, mediocre food, and I would like to wish that busboy all the best."}
{"text":"Close to where we live. Always a great experience. Bar tenders and cocktails are terrific.  Well managed. And always delivers on what you expect.  Hard to find another restaurant in the city that can constantly accomplishes all of this."}
{"text":"This review was based on my experience there for lunch at winterlicious 2014.  Saw Museum Tavern on the Winterlicious line up, so we booked for a birthday lunch (three people total).   Ambience: 5/5 Loved the decor, and the casual and cozy feel.   Service: 3.5/ 4 Slight mix up with resos upon arrival, but nothing that swayed our opinion of the restaurant. Service was efficient, but not particularly friendly.  Food: 4/ 5 While appetizers (seasonal vegetarian soup, mushroom perogies) and mains (fish and chips, duck confit hearts of romaine) were fantastic, dessert fizzled (apple crumble pie: cold, no icecream, poor crust-to-filling ratio; peanut butter tart: plain... okay, but not great), and our great meal ended with a whimper. Over all, would recommend for lunch... but skip the dessert."}
{"text":"One day I may look back at my visit to Museum Tavern as the beginning of the end, since this was my first foray into the cocktail realm and away from my beloved beer.   I came here recently to celebrate Jen K's 3000th review. The long bar was just enough to fit us 15 or so thirsty Yelpers. The drink menu is quite large, ranging from a small list of craft beers, to house made cocktails and even a decent selection of scotch. For my first round I opted for a Kensington Augusta ale which was delicious. For my second round I decided to venture away from my comfort zone and try a cocktail. I explained to the bar tender that I was a novice when it came to cocktails but that I was in the mood for something good and not too sweet, he suggested the \"pomme de terrier\" cocktail ($12). This cocktail was fantastic; it had a strong apple taste with a subtle hint of cinnamon that reminded me of an apple pie. The alcohol in it was strong without being over-powering; it was definitely a well made drink that my beer loving self would come back for any time. I also managed to snag a sip of another Yelpers \"Mumbai special\" and this too was an amazing drink.   The place itself is a nice take on an American pub; it is more upscale then your local pub but is still laid back. Their food menu looked quite good but I was too stuffed from dinner to try anything. The service was absolutely top-notch. Our bartender Tyler was very friendly, was always willing to describe the drinks to us and even put on a show with some dry ice while mixing the cocktails. I would highly recommend you come to this place for a drink. I will be back to try the food and some more amazing cocktails of course!"}
{"text":"Medium Rare Burgers.  Mint Jullep.  Class in drink and chew? Well I would at least wear a suit eating their burgers. And even the shittiest Jullep makes a homeless hobo feel like a southern gentleman. And Museum's assured soon-to-be-broken heart that not only are there plenty of fish in the sea, but I'll be all right."}
{"text":"Good service and good burgers. I went in February but it looks more enjoyable in the summer with the balcony open"}
{"text":"I was shopping around Yorkville the other day and came across Museum Tavern, located right across the street from the ROM. The weather was great, there was a cute little patio, and I knew that this place was participating in Summerlicious, so I decided to try it out.   REGRETS!!! There were two of us, and we each did the $38 dinner. I had the Tuna Albacore Ceviche to start, Steak & Fries as my main, and Cheesecake for dessert. I hate to say this, but I was completely unsatisfied with my ENTIRE meal. The food was just not good at all... The mediocre fries probably tasted the best out of everything I ordered.  The service was friendly, but very slow and inattentive. I was greeted by a polite hostess and I had a nice and informative server. However, I felt like it was impossible to get any of the employees to notice me when I needed a take out box or the bill. Or anything else really. My water was not refilled a single time throughout my dinner, even though I had finished drinking it long before the main entrees came out.  Perhaps Museum Tavern wouldn't have been so bad if I never had such high expectations for it. I can see it as an okay place for hanging out, eating something small, and having a drink. I expected more from a $38 Summerlicious dinner is all."}
{"text":"I met somebody from OKC here last night--first time meeting her and first time at the Museum Tavern.  It was her choice and a really great one at that.  Many of the reviews below mention \"class\" or \"classy\"; indeed, this place is a very class act.  We just had drinks at the bar--eating here requires a reservation, at least on a Saturday night.  The menu does have a lot of great cocktails on it and from what I witnessed, they are certainly made with an expertise and care that commands a slight premium price.  I'd say there are combinations of liquid here that are pretty unique--if you are venturing out of your cocktail comfort zone, this is certainly one of the new hot spots in the city to try.  Boundaries are being pushed here with homemade ingredients and unusual pairings.  But you can also get a great classic here.  The frozen nitrogen is a nice trick.  I went with the flight of bourbon; each 0.5 oz taster, based on what I know, was something I could not get at my local LCBOs.  It was great--1 was very much your typical bourbon but the other 3 were quite unique and could command their own serving during another visit.    I would think of this place as a \"treat\" pub--not the kind of place you'd hang out at every night (unless you are one of those well heeled fat cats that call nearby Yorkville home).  This place would also work well as a date place, especially if you are looking to impress.  It certainly worked as a \"first time meet\" place.  Very recommended!"}
{"text":"Now this is NOT a review about the food, but rather about the service (since we did not end up having any food here, which will be explained below). Gf and I decided to pick out a few places to try for Winterlicious, this being one of them.  We had a reservation at 7:00 PM (made through the phone), but upon arrival, we were told that our reservation was at an earlier time, 6:30PM and since more than 15 min had elapsed since the alleged reservation time as claimed by the host, we were out of luck. (Granted we were give the option to sit for an hour to eat as fast as we could as tables were booked for 8:00 PM, but that is not an acceptable option for us.)  The host stood by his statement that \"It was their protocol to repeat and confirm the reservation time at least 3 times on the phone\", thus no way he claims, that the reservation would not be at 6:30 (along with a heavy emphasis on their \"protocol\").  He also claims that he called my cell phone 15 mins after 6:30 (which allegedly rang 3 times) but my own phone records do not reflect this (granted, I was on the subway at some point after 6:30 to get there, so I am not sure if I was called while I had no service).  We believe we had a 7:00 reservation as when we made our reservation, we both listened in on the call and recorded the restaurant and reservation time on a spreadsheet (which was not populated much at the time, so it could not have been mixed up with another restaurant). I am pretty sure that if any one of us heard 6:30 and one of us typed 7 PM somehow, one of us would correct the other. (And for other reasons, we know that 6:30 is too early for us as we have work beforehand, so we would not make a reservation at that time anyways).  I understand that human errors can happen, and it would be possible on both ends but I feel that the way the host treated us was unsatisfactory. The only \"sorry\" we got from the host, was more of a \"sorry, too bad\", and not an apologetic sorry. This, above all is why I am displeased.   No offer was made to rebook on a different day or any real apology made. Regardless of who made the error, I understand that it would not be fair to the diners after us if we were slotted in, and someone else pushed out as they have nothing to do with this, but at the very least the host could have appeared apologetic."}
{"text":"The famous burger - nothing to really rave about. Just your average (overpriced) burger. To be honest, the fries were the selling point. Love the decor though, makes you feel like you're not in Toronto."}
{"text":"Good Food & Atmosphere but Expensive  The food is good, although the menu is a bit lacking in interesting dishes, but hey, they do call themselves a tavern.  It is a nicely appointed room and the service is good.  I give it a 3-star because I think it is overpriced for what you get.  I know, it's downtown location near Yorkville, but come on, it's on the second floor in a crappy building so the rent can't be that high.  It's not like I'm sitting on the patio at One Yorkville (insanely over-priced) where one expects to pay for the real estate.  It's okay, but wouldn't be my top pick in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Went here for summerlicious this year after missing it last year due to a delayed flight in Buffalo. LOL yes I was going to drive straight from Buffalo Airport to Museum Tavern :/  We had the fried chicken sandwich for lunch and it was perfectly crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. The fries that came with it was pretty addicting. I had the tartare for appetizer while my friend got the riblets, both were pretty good sizes and delicious. I don't remember the dessert much unfortunately.   We didn't get any drinks because it was 11:30am. The patio was really nice to hang out on and enjoy people watching and the sunshine.  Would come back to try some of their standard fare if I was in the area or for Winterlicious!!"}
{"text":"First visit was very disappointing. Our friends made a reservation and had we known if twas Museum Tavern we would have declined.  Drove in from suburbs for what this time was ok, but not worth the drive downtown.  For the prices they charge the value and quality is simply not there."}
{"text":"Winterlicious and a burger article brought a few of us here. We really enjoyed the deliberate decor, low music and the lack of TVs. We were 20min early but were still seated.  Service was prompt, skilled, attentive and kind.  We had the prime rib burgers, duck buns, elk sliders, chicken burgers, aztec salad, truffle perogies, carrot cake and chocolate brownie. I'm a particular diner (some say too particular), but I don't think I could point to one thing about any of these items that I would say needed improvement. Maybe the fries could have used some malt vinegar but I didn't ask at the time.  They even have a guest tap for beer. Great local brew.  If they served those prime rib burgers and perogies off a truck, they'd make a killing.  5 stars solidly. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Came here before the Friday Night Live at the ROM. It is a great date spot. They had a nice wine special. Their crab cakes are really good! Not rushing to come here again (although my fiance is), but if I was in the area and wanted something more refined than a pub, I would happily dine here!"}
{"text":"Was there in a Friday night for oysters and cocktails. Not happy hour proces but the oysters are great. Bartender crafts wonderful drinks and is helpful in suggesting others. Not a sports bar (tv is tiny lol was fun watching people try to see the score) pricey but excellent drinks. Nice place alone or small group can't see it being a large group spot at all."}
{"text":"I was surprised by how much I ended up liking this place.  Nice wintry ambiance.  Well done inside...love the copper.  Location isn't great...and it would be easy to miss...that said it is one of the only good spots in that pocket so those in the Annex should support them.  We wandered in...sat at the bar.  There were tables...its a french bistro, meets British gastro pub vibe.  The bartender was a bit all over the place...a 'mixologist' for sure.  Took his organge zest very seriously.  He makes a good cocktail, but didn't gristle at pulling a pint either.  Menu is tricky - do you go for the small plates or a meal...we mixed and shared.  The Mexican chips with cheese & chillies...really big...yummie, but we couldn't finish...the folks beside us had the tuna cones and the lobster roles...we were envious!  I am a believer in basics so tried the Steak Frite (really well executed) and the Cesar salad - tasty, but huge...all in all a top quality meal in a chill atmosphere.  I'm sure there will be a few to many tourists, given its location and already I saw at least one extremely annoying regular distracting the vibe at the bar...so time will tell if it will be a cool spot.    We will go back for sure...and hope that it builds a good crowd..."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere and a very friendly staff. The food is excellent and the price very reasonable. Second time for me with plans for more."}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but the seared ahi tuna burger is really good. $22, spicy mayo and avocado paste. The burger is very flavourful. And tons of fries."}
{"text":"I have had the good luck of being to Museum Tavern many (10+) times; most recently it was with group of 13 friends for a holiday dinner.  This place is super consistent & always on point. Everything I've tried on the menu is delicious, but my favourite thing to order is their Hearts of Romaine (Caesar salad with about a pound of Parmesan on top) with a side of frites (served with homemade mayo). Steak & fries are also delicious, and my husband just loves the Buttermilk fried chicken sandwich. I'll be back on Tuesday & may order the Maple Ribs (one of the only items I have not tried). Bar & cocktails are definitely creative - wine list is also very good.  Atmosphere can't be beat, sort of old-timey, full of character and warmth -  it has a bit of an authentic brasserie ambiance, and it's effect is just lovely.   Staff, and what I can only assume is the super efficient manager/owner, are always pleasant but not cloyingly so. Summertime patio overlooks Bloor st, Philosophers Walk & the ROM.  A sure bet, for casual ($15) lunch, or a dinner to impress.  I recommend reservations for dinner.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place has an old feel to it. Right across from the ROM and attracts an older crowd. Small and not that loud. However, it's overpriced and the buttermilk chicken appetizer was bloody near the bone. The menu is also limited. I hear their burgers are good but at $21-26, I'd rather go down the road or a pub in Yorkville which is a 5 minute walk. Not worth the price. It's overrated."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. Although it doesn't look like much from the outside, its gorgeous inside. The service is fantastic, and the food is high quality and delicious. Their cocktails are really original and delicious. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Based on an article; best burger in Toronto.  Wanted to check out Museum.  Up a set of stairs, it's a medium sized, cozy, well created set-up for a restaurant.  Nice bar on the west end of the restaurant with ample seating.  The burger is $19 with a lot of french fries (swiss chalet style; good!).  It's a filling meal, depending on your financial status; a one time experience or if I had a bigger income, more often.  I will definitely return a few times a year, it was a great lunch (purposely went after lunch hrs, quieter, nice vibe in the restaurant).  Waiter was very attentive and friendly, sometimes you forget what GOOD service is (fast food world it's kinda gone...)."}
{"text":"As I sit on the toilet right now, releasing my lunch from yesterday and smell what I think is digested cheeseburger,  I realized I forgot to review this place.  We came here for lunch.  I ordered the famous double cheeseburger with fries.  The burger is excellent meat.  The bun is not a good bun.  It becomes sloppy and starts falling apart and then you use knife and fork.  It's not the best burger I've had but it is very good.  The fries on the other hand.  Quite possibly the best fries I've ever had.  They get an extra star for using Heinz and not buying into the BS fake leamington tomato cries.  Frenches ketchup sucks!  The service is super friendly as well.  I would love to try their other things.  I will return on my next visit to the ROM."}
{"text":"Great service and a very tasty chopped salad last week for a business lunch. Was tempted to go fried and burgerish, but lived vicariously as I watched others do that."}
{"text":"I came here for drinks with a girlfriend on Sat night. This is not like a regular bar, this is cool bar. In all seriousness, they take their cocktail making with great dedication and a focus to quality. The bar is lined with various tinctures to perfect them - it's like an apothecary of alcohol!  We both ordered the Lucien Gaudin. While delicious, I developed a slight allergic reaction (i.e. stuffy nosed) and when I explained to the bartender in the hopes of understanding and pin pointing what ingredient it could have been, the bartender offered to make me another one, different, because I should enjoy a drink and not suffer! I am impressed with this level of service because most bartenders don't care.  He asked me for my preference (quite a feat for someone who is not a liquor connoisseur) and prepared a beautiful gin sour. Tasty and enjoyable.  This is a lovely place to grab a cultured drink. When you are not in the mood for a beer or wine."}
{"text":"Second level patio, overlooking the Frank Henry designed museum across the street is a real draw for this restaurant. Our pasta dishes were very good and the servers were solicitous."}
{"text":"I had come here once before excited to dine for dinner after having read the many reviews. But being the late person I am, as I was a walk-in they told me it would have to be a two hour wait. SO after knowing that \"Yes, this place really IS popular\" I decided to make a reservation for Summerlicious Lunch (or Brunch ...) and of course I wasn't disappointed.  GET THE PATIO. IT IS SUMMER AND LOVELY. Also definitely get a drink. And not, not just water. That's not fun right? As soon as we stepped into the restaurant , the servers were very charming and the food was AMAZING.   Larger portions than I expected and I could barely finish dessert. I got the 12 Grain Salad to start (already filling) and the Southwestern Steak Salad as the main.  For dessert I got a Sorbet and my boyfriend got the Blueberry pie. I wasn't too impressed with the dessert as it looked like they kind of just plopped it on the plate... But the pie was definitely something else. I still give the restaurant 5/5 stars for the amazing service though.   :)"}
{"text":"Came for winterlicious and thought the food was average but didn't live up to the expectations of all the rave reviews. Had the pierogies (ok), fried chicken (the best part of the meal), the Arctic char (ok) and the steak and fries (ok). Overall was underwhelmed and the most disappointing part was the dessert which we didn't even want to finish. Service and staff were friendly when we came."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious 2016  - had the Tuna Avocado Ceviche, Buttermilk Fried Chicken Burger and Ice Cream Cookie to finish.  If you intend on coming here for Winterlicious, avoid getting the ceviche to start, while it is delicious, you get 3 pieces of tortilla chips with avocado and tuna spread on them on a plate with some parsley garnish as decoration. It was quite the joke at our table. Other people at my table tried the ribs and they're the way to go!  Service was great nothing to complain about there - attentive and polite."}
{"text":"I came here for Summerlicious with my boyfriend and a friend.  I really liked the decor which had a nice gastropub feel.  The service was friendly and attentive.  And the food was excellent.  There were a number of items on the menu on the regular menu that I want to try and will definitely come back to taste 'em!"}
{"text":"Museum Tavern was on my list for about a year especially after I heard it was the number one burger according to the man who ate a burger everyday for a year.   I walked in with a friend this past Sunday and immediately fell in love with the place, it kinda reminded me of a cute New York bar. There was a nice vibe and although it was busy it wasn't very loud.   I knew exactly what I was getting and ordered the Prime Beef Double Cheeseburger with fries. WOW. The waiter brought over a large plate with crispy fries, a tin can with more fries and a decent size burger. I really liked their fries, had a great crisp to it and wasn't too salty.   Moving on to the star of the show; The Burger. The bun was super soft without being very greasy. I took one bite and was in love. The meat melted in my mouth, the cheese was just the perfect amount, and the thinly sliced onions and pickles added a great crunch.   I have to say I was very very surprised, I will definitely be back again! Can't wait to devour another juicy burger!   P.S. I ordered the Chocolate Cake for dessert. Nothing special! It was very hard, not moist and too sweet.   Keep Eating,   Angela"}
{"text":"Great service!  Their burger was a thing of beauty.  Will definitely have to come back to try some of the other food they have.  5 thumbs up out of 5."}
{"text":"I came here on two separate occasions.  The first time was during the Summerlicious event, and they had certain menu items at a reduced price to let people sample their fare.  To be completely honest, I was not impressed with my initial visit.  The service was very slow, and not only were the portions significantly smaller, but the quality just didn't seem like it was there.   The second time I came here was drastically different, and was all-around a much more enjoyable dining experience.  Not only was the service much faster and more pleasant, but the food was much better and definitely exceeded my expectations.  I ordered their buttermilk chicken sandwich and found it to be delicious and filling.  The prices are a little bit on the high end here but the quality and service are definitely on point."}
{"text":"Can't honestly review this place as we never got a chance to order any food. We were a group of 9 and asked if they could accommodate us for a late lunch - they were expecting another group later and we were told that we had limited time. Before our butts even hit the chair we were told we better be quick. If you don't have time to serve, simply say a table is not available. So rude. The bartender was very friendly according to a couple members of our party who staid behind to finish their drink, my daughter said her $14 cocktail was good."}
{"text":"Well, it seems I'm the outlier here.  I cam here for BRUNCH/LUNCH on the Monday of the Family Day weekend, as it was one of the few places open.  I was sorely disappointed by the experience:  The FOOD:  Lunch is served as a $14 prix fixe option according to the menu.  This is a fancy way of saying you're paying too much for a soup & sandwich.  They're served simultaneously.  I had the carrot soup which had a weird off flavor as well as the lamb sloppy joe.  Presentation was terrible.  The texture of the sloppy joe was weird...maybe one should stick to beef and the sauce was sickly sweet.  My friend's Brie and Peameal sandwich looked rather unappetizing.  It also had the thickest slice of peameal bacon I've ever seen...not nice.  The neighboring table had ordered fish & chips, which was sent back for being raw on the inside.  Guess we weren't the only disappointed patrons. ** 2 stars for food. (that's being generous).    The SERVICE: Well it appeared our server must have had a very wild weekend, as he was clearly on another planet during our service.  He forgot items, didn't really check on us, and just altogether was possibly the most unenthusiastic server since my junior high cafeteria lunch lady.   */ 1.5 stars for service.  The ATMOSPHERE:  It could be a nice wood-paneled place.  Seems odd they still have Christmas decorations up.    OVERALL, I will never be back here for lunch.  I've had a number of people assure me that their dinner is better and their cocktails are great.  For lunch, avoid this place."}
{"text":"Bad service. Salad salty. Rude waitresses. Again perhaps it's a Toronto attitude.  But will try to come again."}
{"text":"The restaurant is unique, the atmosphere is friendly and is within walking distance from my hotel. The lovely Susanne made me feel right at home with stimulating conversation and a gorgeous smile. I had her choose something for me that she would serve someone their first time at the establishment. The friend chicken burger was fantastic. Moist, soft, hot and all-around delicious. I would love to come back here and try some other things in their menu. Thank you Susanne!"}
{"text":"Interesting food and appetizers. Good atmosphere and service. Excellent cocktails including the Museum Zombie which I had. Lobster roll was quite good."}
{"text":"I like the location and the setting of Museum Tavern. The food was okay, the price is reasonable. However, the staff was not friendly and he might have a bad day. It makes us thinking twice to leave some tips. Although we come to have some meals or drinks, we also expect to be welcomed."}
{"text":"All right my darlings, has it really been that long since I was here last? Apparently so and really, I ve been missing out! We came here for a light dinner and drinks on one of those vile, humid, feels-like-the-back- of-a-truck's-exhaust-pipe summer evenings. I d made a reservation, we showed up, were given a lovely cozy corner booth, the decor is lovely it feels like a Parisian or Belgian Bistro, the lighting is perfect the service is seasoned and smooth. The menu, though not cheap, offers some interesting options (game sausage, short-rib poutine etc. I had the Conservatory Smash Cocktail (Aimee so very kindly offered to serve it in a tiki glass, knowing that this may have been the deciding factor). I also had the oysters (perfect presentation) and the fish tacos.The big difference with this place (compared to many others in this city) is that the execution of flavours along with the food presentation topped off by exquisite service  (Aimee was our patient, helpful and ever the consummate professional server, and yet - other restaurants take note: when the other server was refilling waters at his tables, he d always come and do ours as well. I ve only ever seen this in very high end restaurants in this city, but should be basic courtesy at pretty much all of them) makes this a solid, delectable experience from beginning to end. The kitchen knows what it s doing and every delectable bite is a satisfying experience of flavours dancing on ones palate, constantly surprising. This, dear friends, is precisely how food should taste. When the food, service and environment come together in perfect balance, they become Museum Tavern. Dining out for me is more than about the food. It s an experience. When one such as this occurs, it becomes memorable and stays with me. Thank-you, Museum Tavern for treating your diners with respect and dazzling us with the experience!"}
{"text":"It's Summerlicious time, so a trip to Museum Tavern was required. (I've been wanting to sample their wares for years now.)  For the appetizer, I went with the Mexican Street Corn Salad (faro, tomato, feta, avocado, lime vinaigrette). This was an impressively large portion and it's a good dish, but I can't say I loved it. Though the very ingredients were used very well and were of high quality, I was expecting something a little more flavorful to reflect the \"Mexican\" part of the dish (ie it could've used some South-of-the-border inspired seasonings and spices).  The main was the 24hr Brined Fried Chicken Burger (jalapeno slaw, adobo mayo, brioche bun). I'll admit that I was disappointed by the first bite, as it seemed to consist entirely of deep-fried crispiness. But as I kept eating and I got to the impressively juicy chicken, I began loving this sandwich. The bun and toppings were perfect, while the accompanying fries were above average. (Gotta love a good shoestring french fry.)  I finished off the meal with the  Chocolate Tart (peanut butter sauce, chocolate whipped cream), which was much, much better than I might've anticipated. The tart itself was unbelivably chocolately and rich, while the peanut butter sauce was a perfect accompaniment."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful spot for drinks. I've also eaten here a couple times and the food has been very good, especially the tostadas. Frites are yummy, but go for ketchup - their house aioli just tastes like black pepper. I love the rhubarb bellini and the merlot. My friend loved her \"come fly with me\"."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place with a unique spin on traditional pub food: look no further - Museum Tavern is your place!  Located on the second floor of this building on Bloor, Museum Tavern has a really classic, old timey tavern vibe. There's a small patio out front, and lots of half booth half chair seating on the inside.  Service is really good. The host was very friendly, and our waitress was super knowledgeable about the menu and provided some fantastic recommendations.  With some Johnny Cash in the background, we scoured through the delicious looking menu to make our choices:  For my cocktail I had the \"Pina Kaluha\" - exactly what it sounds like: like a Pina Colada but made with Kaluha, though it was served sort of like an alcoholic snow cone. It was pretty good, though I felt it could have used a bit more booze and a bit less snow. By the time I was finished, there was A LOT of ice chips left that didn't seem to soak up the drink, so when I nibbled on the icy slush it just tasted like ice.  For food I had the pierogies. I was a bit hesitant to get them at first, thinking that it might not be enough for a meal (they were on the starters menu, and most pierogies are a fairly small size) but Oh. My. Gosh. These were the monster of all pierogies. They were about the size of a medium sized Empanada, and it came with 4 of them. The pierogie dough was delicious, and it was stuffed with mushrooms, served on a bed of carmelized onions and crispy boar belly, with a side of sour cream. Fantastic and filling. I was happy I ended up ordering them!  I tried out the Salted Caramel Blondie for dessert. The Blondie was good, but VERY sweet. It comes with 3 small-medium sized Blondie's, and I only ate one. It kind of reminded me of a maple fudge, almost. The Blondie came with yummy toffee brittle, and some incredible popcorn ice cream. I wasn't sure what I was going to think of the ice cream, but in my opinion, it was the best thing on the plate! I want a whole bucket of that stuff at home! Yummm.  The bill was kind of weird - it came standard with the price + tax on the bill, but when I paid cash, the server automatically took the tip out when she gave me my change, which I thought a bit odd? Usually if they auto take gratuity the 15/18/etc % will be on your bill so you know how much you are tipping.  Anyhow, a really pleasant experience and there was so much on the menu that looked awesome I know I will be back. Definitely worth checking out if you want to step outside the typical tavern fare."}
{"text":"When done properly the food is not bad but unfortunately,  the pig mac was raw in the middle.  Raw beef okay but raw pork not okay.  The reason for the one star was more to the service of this place.  Our server did not apologies about the raw food and feel annoyed that she has to return back to the kitchen.  Her attitude as the server was just not good. I didn't get a new burger until I requested for the second time."}
{"text":"Inspired by the best burger article in Toronto to come out and was not displeased.  Food was excellent, well priced and portioned very well. Service was pure perfection, decor was immaculate and lack of music and television of any kind only increased the entire meal.   The burger was cooked wonderfully, the fries were reminiscent of the food truck fare (my favourite type) and the duck buns, which I did not give much credit to - seeing that this restaurant is a self touted tavern - were quite possibly the best stater we had.   I also had an old fashioned, which most places will either completely mess up with the wrong ice or poor taste profile. This came in a glass that was pre-frozen 3/4 full of ice and drink on top. Definitely the most inventive solution to this drink I've ever seen.  I cannot wait to return and try something new."}
{"text":"This place has a cute little balcony patio! So far out of my Summerlicious 2014 spree this has been the best restaurant! I went here for dinner which was $25, way way way better than the $25 I spent at another place for lunch. This place is medium size great for groups of four or less, in my opinion. Our waitress was courteous and friendly which also added to the good experience. I started off with the Albacore tuna tostado, which was ahi tuna served on a flat crispy flour chip. The ahi tuna was prepared very well and the chip added just enough crunch to enhance the soft tuna. The seared burger dish was fantastic, because everything I like was on that plate, two sides (fries and coleslaw, my favourites), big piece of tuna seared perfectly in between sesame buns with a very generous amount of avocado spread! Not having to choose between fries and coleslaw made me very happy plus the amount of avocado spread was truly delightful. The big thick piece of tuna was as good as it gets, hence the five stars. I had the sugar pie as dessert which was a pleasant mix between a Portuguese tart and a butter tart! Overall a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I came here for a late dinner after I landed in Toronto and checked into the Intercontinental Yorkville. This place was down the street. It wasn't too busy on a Monday night, and I opted to sit at the bar. At the recommendation of the cute bartender, i went for the beef short rib french dip sandwich.   They offered a lot of drink options, and I tried 3 of their cocktails because so many were so interesting and the female bartender was on point with her drinks. I 1st started off with the Orange is the New Black. It was delicious. It reminded me of an Old Fashioned, but with a twist. For my 2nd drink I had the Bull Shot because I was curious to try it since it had beef juice in it. For my 3rd drink, i ended the night with Sugar and Spice and Everything nice. It was delicious, and they cooled the glass with liquid nitrogen so they put on a bit of a show with the smoke.   Overall the food was delicious but the drinks were downright bombtastic. If you get the chance, come here for their drinks."}
{"text":"Was here tonight with a group of friends, our party totalled 7. Overall, I liked the place. Nice ambience, our server was very attentive, cocktails were good, and food (mostly) was good. I Would love to give this place a higher rating, but I can't based on one, in my opinion, unforgivable reason: they served my friend raw chicken.   Here's the scoop. Three of us ordered fried chicken. As I watched one friend tuck into a drum stick i noticed a lot of red. I asked him if his chicken was ok. He said he thought so - only a little under cooked. I balked at the news. My chicken was fine, but I also thought a trick of the light may have made it look more red than it actually was. They use a lot of tungsten lighting so everything is bathed in a warm glow.  My other friend ordered the fried chicken sandwich. She cut it in half and immediately dropped her knife. It was about 75% raw. Basically breaded and fried and served raw. I almost spat out my chicken. Luckily she's in the habit of cutting her sandwiches and burgers in half - otherwise a mouthful of raw chicken breast.  I alerted the Manager and he promptly took the plate away. Our server came and apologized profusely (not his fault). They brought her an alternate shrimp Po Boy on her request very quickly which was good.  Still, I've worked as an undergrad for years in restaurants and this is a nightmare for the kitchen and overall reputation of a place. Raw chicken is so dangerous. The Manager should have come and spoken with us and at the least comped my friend's meal. He did nothing beyond remove the plate and made the server deal with it. Lame!  If my other friend ends up sick (the guy who ate the red looking drumstick) then we know what the deal is.  While I think Museum Tavern has great potential I can't get the image of raw chicken out of my head. And the way the manager dealt with the issues implies that it's not a big deal since we caught the mistake before being poisoned. Toronto's food scene is rich, eclectic and competitive. I'll not be coming back here again. For those who dine - check your food before eating."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the MT several times with friends and so decided to go for Summerlicious lunch.  I felt we were being punished.  I had poutine with big cold chunks of curd.  Stirring it with the gravy and fries didn't warm it up.  A minuscule burger on a teeny white bun that turned to paste in the mouth.  Although we were there at 12:00 they were all out of butter tarts.  We had the blueberry crumble instead - I have had better at coffee shops.  It was a cold blueberry square with what seemed to be canned pie filling.  We asked if it could be warmed up.  After some hesitation the waiter put it on the warming area under the heating lights and returned it cold on a warm plate.  Really - a bit more effort would have made a better lunch and I don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"We went to the Museum Tavern for supper this evening.  It was fairly busy.  We sat on the dining room side.    Dylan, our server, recommended the cheeseburger so that's what we both ordered.  I got mine without cole slaw, cheese, lettuce and onions.  Gord got his as the menu stated with American cheese.  We both really enjoyed the burger ... it was delicious!  The bun was soft, which I like, and the bun-to-burger ratio was right on.  When I asked what the sauce was, Dylan said it was their version of a Big Mac sauce.  The fries were tasty.  Gord said the cole slaw was disappointing.  We'd both go back for the burger and fries.    Dylan took good care of us!"}
{"text":"I didn't want to come here because the word Tavern scares me when you have children. I didn't want to have that feel of going to a bar with your kids. However, once we were inside, we saw other families there with their own kids and high chairs, it calmed my nerves.   We were seated in a booth and they had a booster seat for my daughter. It was a nice way to make me feel included since most restaurants that have the name Tavern, isn't exactly kid friendly.   To start, we got the beef short ribs poutine and where else can you get good poutine besides Canada? Come on, so of course we had to get it. It was one of the best poutines I've had and I've been to Canada many times. My husband got a cocktail to wash it down with.   For out entrees, my girls shared the bacon truffle perogies, perfection of clouds with delicious bacon. I couldn't stop eating their plate, it was that good. I got the shrimp po' boy and oh my! It was one of the best shrimp po' boy I've ever had. Perfect combination of tangy, sour from the pickles, savory and zesty all in one bite. The shrimps they put in the sandwich was also very generous. My husband got the peameal bacon burger which if you know that in Canada, you need to try peameal bacon. It's like a slice of ham.   For dessert, they have chocolate mousse and lemon cheesecake. We wanted to have dessert and was going to order one but my daughter said \"mommy, I'm tired, let's just go home\" so that's what we did. She must be very tired to skip dessert so I took that seriously.   The tab came to about 78 CAD before a 15% tip. I wasn't used to tipping so little, but in Toronto, 15% is the standard. Though I will say that the service wasn't all that great, but it's understandable since it was a busy place."}
{"text":"I want to like this place because of its cool decor and friendly staff but I found it poor value. I came here for a late lunch and ordered 3 apps and found them to be tiny. The lobster roll I ordered was dry and tasted off. I told the waiter who told the manager and he did nothing about it. Now I'm not one of those crazy people who eat it all then complain I took one small bite which can be mistaken for a lot since it was so small. I ended up paying $65 with tip for lunch and I was still hungry. Why 3 stars and not less? I feel that this restaurant has put a lot of effort to be good and I  remember this chef from lunita and know he can create good plates."}
{"text":"Good things and bad things here.  I have to say, they serve an excellent burger, so if i were to come back, it would be for that reason. Additionally, the flights are great.Good drinks - this is the place.   The negative is really in the service. I can do without the attitude. On two occasions it's been an issue."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch prior to our visit to the museum.  Ordered the duck salad, lobster roll and fried chicken sandwich & fries for the kids. Everything was just ok. Service was great."}
{"text":"I recently got a new job and my boss and another coworker decided to take me here for my welcome lunch and it was absolutely amazing!   To start off, the restaurant looked pretty fancy so make sure you're dressed somewhat well. We sat on the patio and the view was amazing! It's right across from the ROM!   With regards to the food, we shared the elk sliders and crab cakes and I ordered the ahi tuna burger! The elk sliders were delicious! First time ever having \"game meat\" and it blew me away! The sauce on the elk sliders had complimented the elk perfectly! The crab cakes were pretty good as well, had a lot of flavour and was nice and crispy!   Now, the ahi tuna burger! It was amazing! The tuna was really fresh and the sauce they had on it was delicious! Probably one of the best \"burgers\" I've ever had!   Also, not to mention, the server was super friendly and was very cute!   If you're in the ROM area, I would totally recommend trying this place out :)"}
{"text":"Came back here for a second time to eat. All I have to say is NOM.   WHAT TO GET:  Tuna Poke cones. That tuna is fresh, fresh y'all.  Fish and Chips. Our fish was white sea bass but I think it changes. It was a solid portion and two can easily share this dish (if you're getting appetizers). Lots of fries and a great tatar sauce are good accompaniments.   MISSES:  Hot lobster rolls looked promising but the lobster was dry.  Tostada WAS good but it's a very messy and awkward dish. I think I was hoping more for this one.   Service is GREAT and drinks are VERY boozy.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Not cheap but this place is damn good. My boyfriend even went so far as to say it's his favorite place I've taken him in Toronto.   We shared the bacon & blue cheese stuffed chicken wings to start. They were hot and crispy and delicious. I had the Tuna Poke Cones and he had the Tuna Burger (which could be cooked to your liking, i.e. blue rare!). I love raw tuna and it was clear that the fish was very good quality.The fries that came with were also delish. My only complaint is that I found the coleslaw just a slight bit too salty (but I think salt tolerence is pretty subjective)  Finished off with the Key Lime Parfait. AMAZING! I think they may be retiring it for the winter season but, good god, if it's still on the menu when you go, have it!!  Service was also excellent. Fast, efficient and helpful."}
{"text":"Terrible service yet we were charged a mandatory 18% tip because there 6 of us. I'm pretty easy going about restaurants and never complain or review on line, but this is the one exception.   I've been to the Museum Tavern a few times before, as the location across from RCM is convenient, but I will never be back after my latest experience.   Food was meh (only 6 tortilla chips and way too much cheese) on the $15 plate of Nachos, 1/4  the mussels in my order were not cooked),  But service was awful!!!! We waited way too long for service and the host declined to seat our whole group (12) together on a the basis that there were reservations for the adjoining tables. All this even though the place was half empty. And when I later renewed our request to sit with friends when the adjoining tables emptied, water said he'd ask the manager in charge of floor plan again, only to ignore that request altogether (never got back to me). Then we get a 'don't worry I've included the (18%)gratuity in your bill'. Not nice!"}
{"text":"Because I only ever find myself in this part of town once in a blue moon, Museum Tavern is like a pleasant surprise to return to every time I have half forgotten about it. Thank goodness for Yelp!  Funny enough, their location is what initially drew me to the lounge many moons ago. I suggested it for cinq à sept out of convenience and was pleasantly greeted with their happy hour menu of drinks and snacks. My drinks date and I immediately fell for the casual-yet-classy decor and vowed to return soon and often.  The warm service is something that consistently stands out for me on every visit. No matter if it's a rammed Saturday night with standing room only for fellow arts patrons from across the street or if you've just strolled in post movie just in time for the 11pm last call from the kitchen (as we did just this past Tuesday). The servers and bartenders are always kind and welcoming.  Don't be fooled by the simply named tuna poke cones. The delicately crisp and buttery cones that envelopes the flavourful Hawaiian version of ceviche is a serious contender for replacing nori. They're mouthwatering to even reminisce about. Beware that both the starter fried chicken and the sandwich are named the same thing on the menu. The burger version overflows with jalapeños.   Last but most definitely not least, the list of libations on offer is most impressive. The Annex cocktail even features pomelo juice. Pomelo juice!"}
{"text":"The 3.5 average rating makes sense to me, but I'll round up for these guys.  According to other Yelp reviews, the burger here has been in the discussion for the \"best burger in Toronto\"; so I had to order that of course.  Overall, I'm a fan; I obviously can't say if it is indeed the best burger in Toronto, but it was pretty good.  Best burger I've ever had?  Not quite, but i'd order it again.    If had to compare it to SOMETHING, I would say it's a smaller Shake Shack.  Each bite is really juicy and flavorful; I just wish I could have more.  Fries are okay, but they give you the Five-Guys-Treatment there (a huge load of fries and then an extra cup to top it off).  My friends and I also ordered nachos as an appetizer.  Rather than a plate full of loaded nachos, it was 10 chips that were \"individually\" loaded.  While I can appreciate a unique approach to nachos, my stomach desired quantity over quality in this case.  Given the classy look / ambience and the food portions, I'd say this is more of a classy-but-not fancy-date kind of place rather than a hangout-to-eat kind of place.  It's conveniently located across the Royal Ontario Museum, and it's a good option if you don't want to eat at the museum itself."}
{"text":"Great new place!! Highly recommend it. Staff was friendly and food was outstanding. Menu was diverse and would suggest the duck buns and salted Carmel ice cream."}
{"text":"I'll begin by saying that Travis is one of the best bartenders in the city. That saying if you are into drinks tonight, it certainly makes sense to sit at the bar. We came here for the Old Fashioned, and gosh Travis can make more than a few versions of that one, starting with the house version and taking it all the way to your personal liking. I would admit that was the best bar service in Toronto I ever received. Concerning food options, they were quite delicious as well, lamb ribs and tuna cones complimented our  cocktails to a T. The dessert didn't disappoint either.  I can certainly go on and on about the decor, it's retro look and feel, about the copper bar and vintage ceilings, tiles on the floor and in the waterclosets. BUT. What is really important, there actually is a spot in TO that serves great food and great cocktails, and that one reason to come here and celebrate this glorious occasion. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I like Museum Tavern more for drinks and appetizers than dinner.  It's a great location and the service is very good.  Very friendly staff and the food is first rate--nothing too bizarre."}
{"text":"Have been to this place two times now, and both were really great. The menu offers a variety of interesting options from different cuisines. The food is fantastic (got some appetizers the first time and the duck the second time). My friend had the chocolate cake desert and also enjoyed it. The service was pretty quick, and the waiters were friendly. The music and lighting also added to the overall atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's one of our go-to restaurants when my and my husband are feeling like a bite, but don't want to go too far. I really don't understand the not-so-great reviews, because we have been here at least 6-7 times and have had really good experiences that keep us coming back.   The ambience in the restaurant is nice - a bit dark and romantic in the evening. The tables are small, but it reminds of a bit of a crowded bistro. I also love the covered patio during the summer - it has a nice view overlooking the ROM. We normally have pretty good service and the food comes out quite fast. Sometimes our server may not be the friendliest, but the service is prompt, polite and efficient. Most importantly, we always have full drinks and the food comes out right!!!  The prime beef double cheeseburger ($19) here is, dare I say it, one of my all-time favourite burgers ever. I think it even outshines Richmond Station's burger (which is really saying something). It is a small burger in diameter, but packed with deliciousness. Two juicy patties, American cheese, very thinly sliced red onion and pickles on a fresh bun? You can't go wrong. The fries here are always on point too - they are piping hot, crisp and just delicious. I would also recommend the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich ($18). This is served with a generous piece of chicken, and a spicy adobo mayo. I have also tried the ginger steak salad, which was not particularly good. The steak was a bit chewy and the salad didn't pack the punch I expected. I guess that's what you get for trying to order a salad....  Honestly, the worst meal we had here was during Summerlicious 2017. My husband ordered off the menu, and he got the fried chicken sandwich, the duck buns and a butter tart (if I remember correctly). We have had the fried chicken sandwich before, and he said it wasn't as good. Maybe this is because of the large amount of food the restaurant is pumping out during Summerlicious? I'm not sure. Either way, we will continue coming back for the regular menu!"}
{"text":"Went there last night and sat at the bar. The decor is gorgeous, and the bartender was attentive. I had one cocktail off the menu and ordered two other classic ones -- which were, in fact, better than the one off the menu. Not necessarily worth the price for the taste, but I guess you're paying for atmosphere, which is indeed wonderful.  The mistake was ordering a plate of nachos. These were described as \"Texas Nachos\" and they also cost $13. My companion and I were operating under the naive assumption that we might split this $13 nacho plate. What came was a small plate blanketed in cheese, with some squiggles of things and some cilantro on top. And a small bowl of salsa on the side. We strained to see the nachos. I think there were about six or so. No exaggeration. No more than six. The bar tender looked at us and said, \"Let me guess, you expected some nachos?\" I noted that it would have been nice to have a few more nachos for all that cheese and he said, \"But you'll get forks to eat it with.\"  Okay, these nachos, once we were able to dig them out of the cheese gloop with our fingers (they really were completely covered), were very, very good. And then we still had a plate covered with cheese, and no nachos. Oh, also, there was the salsa -- what in the world was the point of that? Salsa is for when there is a dry spot left on a nacho that you would like to get wet. Or maybe for the nachos on the bottom of the stack, the ones with less cheese on them. But there were no nachos on the bottom of the stack. There was no stack.   In any case, the promised forks did not come. I suppose the idea was to use the forks to eat the gloopy nachos, but we had already excavated all there was to excavate for a while, and finally I asked the bartender about the forks and he brought them over. But at that point we'd waited so long that the cheese had hardened. And you know, it's really not that satisfying to eat random melted cheese with a fork. They've invented a neat little thing for that. It's called a nacho.   Bathrooms were clean at the start of the evening, very much not later on. I guess the best thing is to go when no one else is there, and only have drinks.   Anyway, two stars for ambience and decent drinks, but one star off for dirty bathrooms and gaps in service, and two stars off for abuse of the English language and the state of Texas. I've lived in Texas. If you tried to charge someone $13 for a plate with six nachos on it, and told them these were *Texas* nachos, you'd regret it fast."}
{"text":"Today, my friend and I made a visit to the Museum Tavern for their Summerlicious event. There were quite a bit to choose from on their Summerlicious menu. We went for lunch so it's $15 per person which includes an appetizer, a main course and dessert. I chose the Tuna Tartare as my appetizer, the Shrimp Po'Boy Sandwich served with your choice of fries or a salad and lastly, the Peach Sorbet for dessert.   The Tuna Tartare was light and delicious.  It was tuna and red cabbage mixed with mayo served on top of a baked torilla. I picked a salad over fries and the salad was a garden green salad drizzled with a light dressing. The Shrimp Po'Bo Sandwich was a half sandwich filled with a slice of pickle, some freshly cut onions, lettuce and lightly breaded shrimp. There wasn't a distinctive tatse to it. All I have to say is that it tasted like a sandwich and how it looked. The Peach Sorbet is the same.. it just tasted like peach sorbet as you'd expect.  Lastly, the presentation of these dishes could've been better and they should incorporate some more elements into the sandwich to make it outstanding.   My friend ordered the same appetizer as me, Fish and Chips with the Chocolate and Vanilla cake.  I had a bite of the fish and it had a light batter which was good, however, it wasn't served hot. The presentation was poor I must say.. I also had a bite of the dessert and it tasted like something you can get at your local bakery. Again, nothing special about the taste of the food.   Overall, the food on their Summerlicious menu was mediocre (at least the ones we've tries). If you're looking for something with more flavour and elements then this is definitely not where you'd want to go for lunch. I'm not sure if the taste is the same for their dinner menu since they do have a dinner menu for Summerlicious.   I looked at their main menu as well and the meals and drinks are quite pricey. However, they have exceptional customer service which makes dining very comfortable.  They also have a patio which is great for the summer and the interior decor looks quite antique!"}
{"text":"Went for the Winterlicious menu was completely underwhelmed. Started with the rib ends. 3 overly saucey tough ribs arrived. Second course was super salty steak & fries. The steak wasn't terrible but could have been better without the salty sauce they drenched it with. I had read previously that the chocolate cake was McCain like and that couldn't be closer to the truth.  On the upside our server was super attentive and when we enquired about wet naps after those messy rib \"ends\" she quickly brought a mug of warm lemon water and a fresh napkin."}
{"text":"A little birthday cocktail party was thrown for me here last week. While I love the drink menu (real cocktails, great menu) and the location (balcony right on bloor street), our service was questionable at best. We had 9 people in our party with 1 - 2 items per guest and the server couldn't remember who ordered anything.   To make matters worse, he didn't \"know how\" (his words) to split the bill. A friend in my party had to go to the cash *twice* to help him break up the bill (apparently he forgot to save the first time) and in the end my friend had to deliver everyone's bills while he followed behind (because he didn't know who had what).   The topper is that we were still charged the auto gratuity for being a \"large party\".   Pretty sure my friend should have been tipped instead."}
{"text":"I love Flights...  Here at Museum Tavern they offers 4 different spirit flights of 2 oz in total:  - Remy Martins ($25) - Oak Aged Cocktails ($14) - Single Malt of the World ($20) - Through the Region of Scotland ($20)  I really enjoyed my Oak Aged Cocktails Flights that are all Classic spirits cocktails. The neat thing is the bartender would spent the time and explain to you and it is really like a guided tasting.  Museum Tavern also serves wine, crafted cocktails and a decent selection of local crafted beers.  I love the vibe here. Classy but laid back. They also serves food too, and the setting is really bistro like.  Definitely a good place for a drink or 2 if you are in the area. Sitting at the bar and watching the bartender doing his magic is just a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"Went to the Museum Tavern for the first time a few weeks ago with friends. What an amazing place. This reminds me of an old pub in New York. Very classic style, very knowledgeable servers and super tasty food.   We ordered a number of dishes and the Fish & Chips were probably the best I have ever had. Not everyone agreed they were #1, but for me I like a fluffy batter and lighter fish and they were amazing. The steak and frites were great as well. Wouldn't recommend the maple whatever ribs only because the other dishes were so unbelievable. Carrot cake for the finale was absolutely delicious although very sweet.   Lastly, any place that carries Blanche de Chambly is automatically a favorite... Highly Recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"I have found it inconsistent here. Sometimes great. Other times have encounteres screw ups. E.g. seizing sauces, slow service.  Overall, worth trying though and a cool spot."}
{"text":"Ordered a cheese burger and it was good. Two burgers plus two pint of beer, we ended up paying $80 which was a bit pricey but okay, because it's downtown location."}
{"text":"First of all how this restaurant gets a two dollar sign rating is beyond me. 19 dollars for a burger is outrageous!  The menu is very limited. Ordered and shared the $14 nachos which were 8 chips with toppings of cheese, onions, guacamole, jalapeños and runny sour cream. They were just ok. This restaurant has nice atmosphere and great potential but grossly overpriced and it is reflected by the lack of clientele."}
{"text":"We visited Museum Tavern near the end of our week-long vaca in Toronto last week, during a day when we were cramming in our last tourist blitz.  We were in a hurry, and it was near ROM, so we popped in.  It was a mistake.  I feel bad not leaving a better review, as our server was lovely, if inefficient.  We ordered two burgers, an order of elk sliders without cheese, and a nacho app.  The sliders arrived with what we assumed was cheese, but may have just been sauce.  (There was no sauce listed on the menu, and my teenaged daughter was disappointed that they were dripping in sauce.)  The nachos were eight chips smothered in beans and cheese, and then baked until the exposed chips were burned and the buried portions were soggy.  They were not edible.  The burgers were okay - I'm not a fan of American Cheese, and the meat was so greasy it was literally dripping.  Though we didn't complain about the food or the wait (40 minutes for our food to arrive), the server offered a free dessert.  We accepted a slice of chocolate cake, which the kids said was good.  Others seemed to be enjoying their lunches, but for us, this was a low point."}
{"text":"Arrived with no one to greet me and my partner . We were meeting with friends so when I saw them I just joined them to shady glances from servers.  Another server provided great service but they got my order wrong twice. Still payed for my meal full price and Still tipped standard but overpriced and overrated TBH. Btw I ordered the buttermilk chicken sandwich it's smaller than your avg sandwich bun and slightly larger than a slider $18 This is Bloor st not yorkville they need to stop trying so hard. Probably best going next door."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and an even better menu. Everything is delicious, I recommend the mushroom perogies. Only downside is they dont do a weekend brunch.......yet!"}
{"text":"Super service.  Great burger, nice selection of wines. Fries a bit on the salty side for me."}
{"text":"I want to like this place because of its decor, location, and ambiance. A lot of care and attention have been put into the space and it kind of resembles Le Select Bistro on Wellington, except they're not French here. Overall, cocktails and food are good, but I don't like when appetizers / small eats cost more than mains. If you were swinging by for a small bite before hitting the ROM and wanted to split a couple starters with a friend, it is not cheap. The prices are more reasonable if you're there for dinner."}
{"text":"My wife and I used to look forward to coming here, but we were very dissapointed after our last visit. I think the chef or owner has changed or something. The food was so bland. I had the lobster roll, and all I could taste was mayonnaise served on wonderbread. The ambience has changed too. It used to have a 1920's vibe, but we didn't get that this time."}
{"text":"This place rocked.  The cocktails were amazing.  Square cubes, frozen glasses, torches.  Everything was just awesome.  A top-notch bar experience."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and it is a great spot for drinks in a more formal setting.  It has a nostalgic feel that is quite unique and intimate.  The flip side of that intimacy is that it fills up quickly and you may be forced to wait or flip to another choice.  The menu is strong, I really liked the fish tostadas but its overall strength is for drinks"}
{"text":"Me and the bf came here spontaneously the past weekend because we wanted to grab some food before watching a performance at the royal conservatory of music. We were short on time and got seated in the rooftop patio. It was the perfect weather and such a great view. We quickly ordered drinks and appetizers:  white fish tostadas, steak tartare and the elk sliders. It took about 15 minutes for the food to come which was reasonable because it was so busy (which was a good sign). The best appetizer of the night was the steak tartare. It was so flavourful. Even my bf who doesn't like tartare loved it. The white fish tostadas was very good too, loved the creamy sauce and avocado but the fish was slightly over cooked but we still enjoyed it. The elk sliders were cooked well but nothing too spectacular about it. It was a shame we had to literally gulp down the food and not be able to savour and appreciate the food slowly. Overall we will come back again in the future to try other items on the menu we couldn't try this time but not anytime soon because it is on the pricier side."}
{"text":"Great environment and view. Have enjoyed a lot on this menu, but the game sausage and spaetzle are something special. They have great cocktails. Had my first barrel aged Manhattan and Sazerac here, got me into craft cocktail making and aging myself."}
{"text":"The interior is fantastic. Very 1930s - pressed tin ceiling, great bar, pendant lighting. It's a few doors down from the Intercontinental Yorkville and directly across the street from the Royal Ontario Museum.  We arrived at 20h00 on a Tuesday. We had no trouble getting a table for two although we didn't have a reservation. The resto was almost full. It's a bit loud; you wouldn't want to take small children or elderly folks.  My guest and I both ordered the fish and chips. They were average, not better. The fries were cold. I doubt that this is the norm, and would try something else if I returned. They came out very quickly.  Prices are as would be expected in this neighbourhood. Salads are 19-$22. Fish and chips are $20. Burgers are $19-$26."}
{"text":"Museum Tavern has worn many toques for me, and I appreciate her for it.   She has been a warm up spot on a winter's afternoon, filled with same-side boothing and pierogies. She has been a late night watering hole, where a few friends enjoyed bellying up to a bar and imbibing fire-breathing cocktails. She has been a work lunch venue, where lattes and fish tacos were thoroughly enjoyed.   If you're feeling like a high-end Maritimer, as I often am, I recommend the lobster roll. Without going into Yorkville proper, this is *the* place for decent dining and craft cocktails around U of T.   PEPPER'S PISSED about one bad experience here. I phoned to make a reservation for drinks for 10 people last winter and they said I wouldn't need it. I showed up and they were rammed. As I had assigned it as a meeting place before a play, we had to squish in at a very busy bar until everyone arrived. It was frustrating. Learn from my lesson and insist on the reservation."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try out this place but never had the chance, so when I saw it on the Summerlicious 2017 list, I finally decided to give it a go. Made reservation in advance and was greeted by the hostess and immediately seated. Our server came to greet us right away and started pouring us some water, which was very much welcomed since it was extremely hot outside that day. He then explained the summerlicious menu and told us his favorites with lots of excitement. I ordered the pork tostada, steak and frites, and blueberry crumble. Didnt have to wait too long between meals. Pork tostada was good, generous amount of pulled pork! Steak and fries was a disappoinment, the steak was small (smaller than the size of my palm) and there's just too much fries on the plate. The presentation was lacking, borderline poor. The cook on the steak was medium well when I asked for a medium. Too lazy to return it since I was starving. The BIGGEST LETDOWN of the night was the blueberry crumble. WHAT A JOKE!! It's exactly what you would find at Starbucks, their blueberry bar. Had 3 bites before I gave up. It was not good.  Overall, while the service was great, I won't go back. Food was mediocre, presentation was poor, and drinks, while delicious, were a bit pricey. I would rather take my money and go to The Keg for a good wholesome meal. Sorry Museum Tavern, not impressed."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a difficult time at this restaurant, I made the waiter aware of my Garlic allergy when I ordered their Hamburger and did mention that  I didn't want any garnish with it along with it, when it came it was smothered with a mao sauce and had to have it return. When I ordered this hamburger I asked for a tomato slice to be added I was told that the chef wanted to charge me 3.00 dollars for the tomato on a 20.00 dollar hamburger. I asked to see the manager he was the most unhelpful person and seemed mad that i asked to see him. My husband was almost finished his dinner when my hamburger arrived and was told that they dont have tomatoes except for cherry tomato. So 3.00 for a cherry tomato still seems excessive. Bottom line to this story is we wont be returning. Beware!!!"}
{"text":"Walked by the neighborhood a lot, looked interesting from the outside. I didn't know what to expect, when you walk in the atmosphere is just beautiful. Being out running errands we weren't exactly dressed up, it does have the vibe that it is trying to be upscale. We sat at the bar for lunch and a couple beers. They have 5 beers on draft and a small but eclectic selection of bottled beer as well as their own takes on classic cocktails. The service started out great, I had a Black Oak pale ale and we both ordered a rather unique quinuoa crusted Tofu sandwihc on a torpedo bun with salty fries and a fresh red cabbage coleslaw. The food was fantastic, the fries salty but not too much, the sandwich was actually amazing. The only negative was when the evening bartenders came in they were faux nice enough, but a real turnoff for me was hearing them bitch about the other bartender and the front end staff. The more senior bartender was very professional but after that display every attempt to engage us in polite banter seemed fake. Hopefully they sort out the attitude of a few members of their staff, great place otherwise."}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago for Winterlicious. We were seated by the door but shortly after moved to a spot closer to the kitchen. The gentlemen that helped us out with this was very nice.   Although at first one waiter came to our table, throughout the meal we were served by like all of them, which was kind of odd but fine.   The food was really good. For my app I got the tuna ceviche, for my main I got the steak and fries and for dessert I got a cookie with ice cream.  The tuna ceviche was delicious except the presentation was kind of poor, but whatever, it didn't take me very long to eat anyway :P the steak was delicious. The tavern sauce that they put on it was great and there was no shortage of fries. The desert was mediocre.  It was kind of weird because they brought out my dessert first, and obviously I had to start eating it right away because it was melting, and I finished and they still hadn't brought out my boyfriends dessert yet. We called it out nicely and it was clearly a communication error, but they brought it for him shortly after.  Everything was really good except for my chinsy app. I'd consider coming back."}
{"text":"I think this is going to be my new go to place. Place looks great and not dark and dingy the name Tavern would suggest. Nicely lit space. Service was good and server was very accommodating. Has a lot of local and microbrews on tap. I found it kind of odd the number of things on the menu that weren't available, but that was ok.  Girlfriend had a elk tartar just to see if she would like it before she ordered elk sliders. That was great. I ordered a burger and it was one of the best burgers I have ever had, you can order the burger rare, which is always a good thing. The food is well priced, comparable to other bar food, but the food is sophisticated."}
