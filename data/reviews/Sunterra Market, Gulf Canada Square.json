{"text":"I l-o-v-e Sunterra Market.  I use to work in Bankers Hall and it was most exciting to go grab my dinner/lunch from here.  They have a really tasty sandwhich that is turkey and cranberry mayo ...yum!  They also have two really great cold pasta salads, one has chicken, penne, orange slices with a ginger dressing (to die for!) and chicken, penne, pecan salad which is really tasty.  Their butter chicken in their 'big pans' is amazing as well, they usually have it ready for the lunch run at least once a week.  You can usually find left overs after lunch time all packaged up for people to take home.  It a great place to go and pick up a few prepared foods if you just not feeling in the mood for cooking.  They usually have baked chicken, salmon, roasted potatoes, meat pies etc. all sitting in their deli case ready to wrap up for you to take home to heat.  They have a salad bar that is available around lunch time.  It is priced by weight..it can get a little pricy but they always have really fresh tasty items to add to your salad.  I love that you can go to this market and find just about anything your hankering for from cookies to bread to salad and sushi."}
{"text":"I really love this market. I feel like I want to stroll the isles and buy everything. I don't think or didn't feel like anything was way overpriced and there is a lot to choose from. My only complaint is the salad bar- not as fresh as I would have hope and sometimes appears to be a bit of a diaster. Otherwise it's a great market."}
{"text":"I love this place.    Sunterra seems to excel at bringintg you a massive amount of choice for workplace lunches, and pre-made meals for after work convenience.  Not to mention, a butcher counter of meats and seafood, including pre-marinated selections.    There's pizza to go, hot meals that change daily, take away salads, you name it.  YOU NAME IT, and they seem to have it.    I love that they have a salad bar with enough options that I can actually eat healthy, and not get sick of it, every time.   Seriously, a salad bar with enough range that you don't get bored is a victory.  There should be more of these downtown (especially closer to my office).  And really, more around the city outside the core.  I'd visit Sunterra all the time, outside my workday, if they were more accessible for me."}
{"text":"Great place on the plus 15 level (2nd Floor) of the TransCanada building. It's a cafeteria on steriods, it's even licensed. The selection here is insane, from their own freshly squeezed juice, to delicious deserts and fresh sandwhiches, to the insanely good butter chicken \"Big Pans\" mentioned by Kristy H. However, I always order the individual sized Hot Calabrese pizza. The pizzas are at the station at the very back near the washrooms.  They are the thin crust type and they bake them for you right as you order.  At $6.99 it is reasonable priced, delicious and filling.  They open until 6:30 from M-W, until 8:00 on Thu-F and until 5:30 on Sat.  So its a great option if you find yourself downtown outside regular office hours. They also cater and deliver.  I've used them before for catering with success."}
{"text":"Not sure why I continue to subject myself to this place. Probably for convenience only. Typically will only get something small, like soup or a salad, since the rest of their stuff is bland and overpriced. Bought a Turkey and Bean soup today. Went back to my desk and proceeded to scoop the layer of oil off the top of the soup bowl. Upon stirring the soup, I noticed there was 1 chunk of turkey, and have not found one single bean. While I enjoy vegetables, this soup consists of massive chunks of vegetables with a flavorless broth. Three spoons later this is in the trash. Should have saved myself the $4.08 and bought a can of Campbell's Chunky soup.   Again, not sure why I keep going back - but this is the last straw. Most of their food requires one or more of the following after purchase before consuming: Salt, pepper, soy sauce or hot sauce.   If I could give this place zero stars I would. 0/10 - will never buy anything from them again."}
{"text":"I visit Sunterra for lunch far more often than I should. It has a little bit of everything, from yogurt & juices, to a salad bar, to pre-made salad, hot lunches, sandwiches, sushi, cold fruit/meat plates, pastries and pizzas/quesadillas.   I'm a fan of the scones, not so much the muffins. My favourite pre-made salad is the curry chickpea. The hot lunches are very popular, although they've all been misses for me, unfortunately. The salad bar is huge and amazingly popular, but the line-ups mean that it may take you 20 or more minutes in line to get through. Pizzas are also hit or miss for me, but my favourites are the BBQ chicken and the chicken quesadillas.  It gets insanely busy from 12-1 so if you can go outside that timeframe, all the better, but you're likely to miss the hot lunch and/or pizzas. Once they're out, they're out. Sandwiches are packaged like 2 sandwiches in one, so it's cost-effective to share with a friend if you're not a big eater. The staff is always friendly, even when it's packed to the gills.  Overall, Sunterra is one of those places where anyone can find something to eat."}
{"text":"Sunterra is my go-to spot for lunch when I'm at the Calgary office. If you go right at 12 it is PACKED, but I usually manage to sneak away around 11:30 which seems to be perfect timing. It's extra awesome when you have someone up front offering samples of the 'Big Pan' meal, last time I was there it was a delicious butter chicken! When you walk in you're greeted with the most wonderful smells. The salad bar is a great idea, although I usually opt for the pre-packaged steak caesar salad which is really yummy. I do wish they provided more dressing, though! I've had a few of the sandwiches as well, they're all very fresh. My favorite meal from Sunterra was when they did a turkey sandwich, so fresh and it came with gravy and stuffing!! Mmmm I wish I could have that everyday! :) I also really enjoy the fresh squeezed juices, they are so healthy and good. Sunterra has a great variety of food for snacks, lunches, and even dinner! And if you manage to score a table, it's a great spot to have good conversation over a delicious meal."}
{"text":"I like this joint.   Why? It's close to the gym AND I can avoid the disgusting fare of the food court.   Hitting this place up at lunch is suicide, but sort of worth it. A lot of decent vegetarian options and they'll make you a sandwich fresh if you ask.   Decent selection of baked goods to take back to the office too.   The staff is pretty friendly and quick."}
{"text":"I can't say I was super impressed by Sunterra. There are definitely some great things here and I see why people love it but it just wasn't a top notch experience for me. I went with a pre-packed salad, the south west salad. There were tons of toppings and it was quite delicious. For $7 it seems like a great value. The let down here was the lettuce. Where was it? All these great toppings but nothing to hold it up.   Being here right at noon there was a mass of people. This was to be expected. Unfortunately, there isn't a ton of organization to get people filtered through. You just sort of line up at the station you want your meal from, then everyone just kind of mushes together to pay. This seems more like a space constraint than an organization thing, but still a little frustrating."}
{"text":"Quick and easy place to grab coffee and a small bite on walk to the office taking the +15. I was visiting town for work and made Sunterra a stop on way to the office . The prices are reasonable, the food was decent ...i will be back the next time Im in town."}
