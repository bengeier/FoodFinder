{"text":"Not your normal Chinese restaurant as this one specializes in Shanghai cuisine and is very AUTHENTIC. There are a lot of options on the menu but I stuck with the familiar Shanghai Dim Sum (soup filled dumplings). Compared to other dumpling restaurants I've tried (Ding Tai Fung & Asian Legend) I would say this place is my least favourite. I'm not sure if this is the traditional way of making dumplings but I found that the ones served here were more floured and had thicker dumpling shells. I'm not a big fan of this as the texture is more chewy and will make you full faster. For the chunky beef noodle soup I ordered, it was very spicy with a lot of oil and MSG in it. The beef was soft and tender but the noodles came from a frozen package and were not fresh. Not a big fan of this place."}
{"text":"It's where I can go to get my Chink on!  
(I can say that 'cause, well, look at my picture...)

Xiao Long Bao- soup filled dumplings, are so good. But don't bite in too soon, let them cool down otherwise you'll burn the top of your mouth when the hot soup busts out of the dumpling and you'll ruin the rest of your meal.

Peking Duck  (Ok. OK  I know it's Peking and not Shanghai, but it's still good!)  Comes with the wraps, a cooked dish, AND a soup.  just beware, it's a whole meal in itself.

Braised Sea Cucumber and Pork Tendon--told you, it's where I come be my most Chinese.  I really want to order this, but my husband won't touch it, and neither will my whitey-folk relatives. So this time I passed because we were traveling the next day.  Next time for sure!

Garlic Deep Fried Ribs--a little too fried for me.  I'll pass.

Fried Onion Bread (Tsong You Bing)  yummy!

Beef Wraps (appetizer #004, I think)  really really tasty, it's wrapped in a fried bread, so not exactly the health dish you might be tempted to think it be.

I've been here 3 times.  I give it 4 stars only because this last time (2/24/2010) I was there for lunch  and the dishes all seemed like they needed additional seasoning.  Just a touch bland.  

The previous 2 times were heaven on my chopsticks."}
{"text":"There were some hits and misses here.

The place was almost empty on a Tuesday night. We were feeling pretty indecisive, so we got a whole bunch of different things. Sorry, I don't know the real names of anything.

Beef roll appetizer: Tasty beef rolled up in a flakey pastry. This was SO GOOD. The best thing we had there.

Beef noodle soup: Pass, the noodles were undercooked and it was really nothing special. Not a lot of meat, either. You can get much better elsewhere.

Broccoli with egg white: I really enjoyed this. I think it's supposed to have crab in it, but I didn't taste any.

Mushu pork: Only four pastries for a giant pile of pork. I found this really salty.

Wontons in peanut sauce: tasty, not spicy at all.

Dessert - lotus paste in ...deep fried pastry thing: super good!

All in all, the service was really good, but I found the food to be okay, nothing special. We most likely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon for dimsum for the first time, and they have a lot of food here! From Cantonese dim sum, to Shanghainese food, there's something for everyone. 

But the problem with having so many types of dishes, is that you're never going to be stellar at something without the focus. So, the food itself was O-KAY. Nothing special where I would return for, however, there were sooo many things on the menu, that I didn't get a chance to try them all. 

It does seem like a fun place to go with the entire family since there is something for everyone. 

The decor is wannabe trendy. Not the usual wooden tables with white (or plastic) table cloths, or mahjong tables with a table cloth over it. Here they have glass tables and fancy chairs. But if you look closely, they are a bit roughed up on the edges. 

The service was pretty good, and was patient with my mom who asks \"is the xx dish good here?\" - WHY do asian parents do this?"}
{"text":"We ordered the Peking Duck Dinner Special and there are definitely Pros & Cons to this meal.  As for the decor it isn't bad at all with some faux Shanghai skyline wall, a small indoor WATER FOUNTAIN and even a CN Tower-like structure in the middle of the restaurant.

The service was VERY nice which I was not expecting at all from a Chinese restaurant but maybe because I was POLITE.       :-)

The Pros is that the meal was quite a deal at roughly $35($45 tax/tip-in) which is supposedly to serve 3 but enough to serve 5 as my friend said, but I believe I could have finished everything but didn't wanna PIG OUT.  It came with large pot of West Lake Beef Soup, excuse my DIRECT translation.  Salt & Spicy Fried Pork, Xiao Long Bao, Peking Duck 2-ways, Baby Bokchoy, and Mango Pudding(?).

The Soup was very nice with lots of TOFU and a good consistency with the corn starch slurry to thicken it up.  The Pork was same as any other place.  The Xiao Long Bao was OK but the dough was definitely in the way as it was thicker than Ding Tai Fung.  

The Peking Duck was not that great as even though the SKIN was crispy, it didn't REFLECT light like others I've had so I guess it wasn't prepare to that level that Peking Duck is known for.  I'm not an expert but it definitely had a DARKER skin than others which might be due to over-BBQing.

Mango Pudding?!?  When did that become a Shanghai FAVOURITE?  It came out just like how some Jap AYCE serve them in a tiny plastic cup just enough for 1-bite.

There you go, my Pros & Cons...  It's a TIE and therefore my A-OK ranking stands true.  Maybe I'll go visit next time to get my NOODLE on."}
{"text":"I came here a couple times before and have noticed the quality going down each time. The first time I came a couple years back, the food was amazing. And then the time after, the food was mediocre, and the service was very slow. I went this week again and was very disappointed. The only average item was the xiao long bao (shanghainese dumplings). I ordered dan dan noodles and it was very bland. I tried to order this vegetarian tofu dish but they ran out. So we randomly picked another item (which was the whelk??) and it was absolutely horrid. I couldn't eat it and had to throw it out. The sweet and sour ribs were ok, but very small.  I probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years, and I'm glad to know that the food here is still as amazing as before. The menu offers quite the selection, and from what I've sampled, they do most dishes fairly well. The Shanghai special rice & veg is good on its own, or with some side dishes, but it's definitely a must-have. Their Xiao Long Bao is pretty good too. My parents LOVE their deep fried garlic ribs, though I'm not a fan of the grease, but their deep fried rice pumpkin cakes are fabulous! (Eat them while they're hot! Their fabulousness dissipates slightly as they cool...) Last visit, I was introduced to the fried fish with seaweed, which was crunchy on the outside, soft and hot on the inside, and all-around good. As far as I've seen, you can't really go wrong here :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Scarborough. Their food is really good, the place is clean and spacious, service has always been good and attentive, prices are reasonable. It's not a hole in the wall for you to grab cheap food, nor is it fancy enough for special events, but it's a really awesome choice for a family dinner out."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant ever! I love it there, nice design, always people there, so it means everyone loves it there and the food is very tasty - beans, soups, rice, sumplings (specially I love Shanghai style dumplings with soup inside) and they have so delicious freshly squeezed orange juice that you won't get anywhere else. This is definately a must go to place! Even if it's a long drive (it's close to Pacific mall in Markham), it's totally worth it! Won't regret."}
{"text":"Although I have only been to a couple shanghai dim sum places, I keep going back here because I find it so awesome. They have a dim sum menu all day (their lunch dim sum has more variety, but I can get everything I want on their all day). Their soup filled dumplings is the reason I go here when I'm in the area.

They have a huge menu, the place seems to be busy all the time, and the servers are nice too.

I have no complaints about this place and look forward to finding another shanghai dim sum that can dethrone this place"}
{"text":"The service is good and the food is awesome! They have the super thick Shanghai noodles which are really delicious. Definitely try the (red?) braised beef noodle soup. It's a bit spicy, but so good! If you don't like spicy, but still want to try the noodles get the stir fried Shanghai noodle. The Xiao Long Bao and Shanghai style pan fried pork buns are really good, too! Just remember to let them cool down before eating. The price is reasonable and I just really enjoy this place! Definitely the place to go to if you crave/want to try Shanghai food!"}
