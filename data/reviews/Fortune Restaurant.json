{"text":"this place was really really yummy loves their BLT sandwich and plus really cheap FOR A LOT OF FOOD!"}
{"text":"I had Mapo tofu and Malaysian style noodles from here.  Total came to $13.93.  The tofu was delicious but a tad salty with decent kick.  When my mom makes it my mouth is a bit more on fire but this wasn't bad.  I really love tofu though almost any way you cook it.  You get quite a lot of it (if you look in my picture I posted - a whole plate full) and it comes with a cup of soy milk and a bowl of rice.  And I haven't had Asian style soy milk in a long time so this was just too yummy.  The Malaysian style noodles:  first, I don't really know what flavours of Malaysia are.  These noodles were the flat noodles stir-fried with bean sprouts, onion, bits of pork and lots of shrimp seasoned with what I think were curry spices (cumin at least - yellow) and red pepper flakes.  I don't know if that is a usual Malay spice used but regardless, it was good.  It was however nothing special.  It was the classic flat noodles stir-fried with lots of grease and just a spice or two different.  You do get a lot though.  This meal also came with a cup of soy milk.  Yum.  Wait time is like 15 minutes when it's busy.  This wasn't bad because it gave me time to scope out a seat.  All in all, it was a good meal for only $14 and I didn't even have to tip.  My girlfriend and I were stuffed and it had the classic \"I feel gross\" feeling after eating that I usually get when demolishing take out Chinese food.  Would I be back?  Possibly because they have a gigantic menu but probably not for a while.  Not because of poor performance or anything but because there are so many options in P-Mall and being a fat kid, I would love to try them all."}
{"text":"Maybe I haven't been out too often recently, but it's my first time in a really long time seeing a HK style cafe opening in a food court environment. Standing at the store front, you can see that they have an extensive menu of typical HK dishes one would expect from a HK cafe, including baked dishes, afternoon tea combos, and various soup noodles. Signs are brand new and they have a nice colour theme. HK-style is my favourite cuisine (if it is considered one hehe..). So as I was standing in this food court, it was a no-brainer for me, I had to try it.   I decided to order one of my fave HK dishes: Ox tongue with tomato sauce on rice. It was a risk because not many restaurants can master this dish. For a food court, wait time was pleasant. However, my ox tongue came out overdone, very dry and chewy. Actually to the point where I could not chew to swallow it. The tomato sauce was very raw and tomato-y, not the sweet kind of tomato sauce. I would not order this again from here.   Milk tea was below par.. Milk tea is one of the staple items in HK cafes and is usually relied upon to bring back customers, but it didn't do it for me. Disappointed, I did not get to finish my meal. Other people in my party ordered rice noodles of its variety, those were good. I would say it's safe to order those.   For now, I would give this spot some time to mature. The food and its prices are reasonable, but since I had this unimpressive first experience, I personally will not be back for a while or go out of my way for a visit. Its colour theme and name strongly reminds me of Fortune Stone on Warden/Steeles in the T&T plaza, which is a spot I regularly eat at... but I could be wrong :P"}
{"text":"very bad experience!! this store gave counterfeit $20 bill and blamed us back for using it!! we called mall security but they couldn't do anything.. watch out when you get the change back"}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE. I came back to order the exact same thing as last time & they laughed in my face. I will NEVER be back here. They need to learn some manners. Please tell me how ordering rice noodles & mixed veggies is so funny? What the heck!"}
{"text":"This is a little place in the pacific mall food court upstairs in the mall. The food is good I usually get the beef tenderloin or sweet and sour chicken with rice both delicious."}
{"text":"Had their daily special and it tasted more like left over a that needed to be cleared out"}
