{"text":"Wow!  This place is great!!  Absolutely fresh, organic ingredients that well prepared and very tasty.  You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table.  This place will soon be packed.  We both had the chicken fajita tacos.  Will soon go back to try the other menu items.  Salad dressing has a touch too much sugar."}
{"text":"Great food...great choices. Both Clean Mexican food and stone fired pizzas. Non gmo food here folks. We ordered a side of guacamole and chips for $5 and the bowl had two huge scoops of guac...more than enough for two people..we actually took most of it home and snacked on it later. Win win.    For people who like soda, they do offer regular kinds of soda products but also fresh lemonades , teas and Horchata.  I had the skinny chicken fajita bowl which was very tasty and again a very large portion which I could only eat half of.   The presentation of our meals were beautiful, the restaurants spacious and has multiple seating styles so if you have a large group, or small, the space is accommodating,including a nice outdoor seating area as well.  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and was very pleased. The food and ingredients are fresh and the customer service was superb. The staff was very welcoming and friendly. I will definitely be a regular here!"}
{"text":"This place is very good, salsa bar, free chips. I had the Burrito, get it with the Ranchero Sauce- and they will serve it fully plated.  I will be back again to try other items,  they have a large menu options."}
{"text":"We decided to try out Sharky's for the first time. My boyfriend ordered the tostada with chicken and I ordered the chicken taquitos. I found my taquitos to be very bland. However, my boyfriend really enjoyed is chicken tostada, which was much more flavorful then my dish that's for sure!  They also brought out complementary chips and have a salsa bar by the fountain drinks, which we completely missed. That being said, we ate our chips dry... But I liked the chips alone, they were freshly baked and warm with a hint of lime. The restaurant itself was very nice & clean. Staff was friendly and greeted us as we entered.  The dishes altogether are supposed to be healthier and organic and even though my dish didn't have much flavor, I would go back to try the other dishes!"}
{"text":"You better get there early because the word is getting out and they are getting swamped! Food is fresh, tasty, plated nicely, and the service is attentive. Service is modified counter with delivery to your table.Manager visits with customers and wants feedback. Orders can be customized. Ingredients are all GMO-free, and Organic, locally-sourced whenever possible. Salsa Bar selections are made daily. Food just seems fresher! Restaurant is Mexican themed so don't expect Denny's variety. Compared to the competition, their product is refreshingly different. Portions are ample to large.  Only drawback, background music is loud for conversation but not overwhelming. Hope they tone it down a bit."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service! Looking forward to coming back! The taco plate was awesome. Tons of flavor and large portions."}
{"text":"Great clean and fresh food, all organic! Huge menu, lots of choices. This restaurant is very popular in California, but new to Vegas. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Recently visited for the first time based on the positive reviews.  I tried the Fajita tacos (steak and chicken) and was pleasantly surprised.  They both had fresh avocado and a nice salsa.  The toppings bar is great with onion, Cilantro and various salsas.  You are also given complementary chips which were nice and fresh.  The four cheese pizza was a bit underwhelming as it's on a large tostada vs dough.  Overall, it was a good experience and worth a try."}
{"text":"What an awesome take on the hipster model of slow fast food.  Loved the entire menu of healthy whole food options.  I had the roasted veggie bowl and I was delighted by the flavor of this slow fast food and the fact that it was a legit healthy meal.    I wish they had locations on the east coast!"}
{"text":"I have been twice.  First time was great.  Love the salsa bar and the first event was pretty good and a nice atmosphere for a quickie.    The customers are a little annoying quibbling at the sign and taking 'forever' to order so they can pretend they are so health conscious while eating their Mexican feast.  But that's nothing to do with the restaurant so let me stick to the facts.  Chicken burrito was great.  Not really better than Café Rio if putting them side by side.  Perhaps it's true it's healthier.  Meal options come with organic items and brown rice, etc.  Second time visiting Sharky's, I had a chicken quesadilla which is heavily why I give this place a 3 stars.  Tasty but \"where's the beef?!\" or rather \"where's the chicken?\".  Presentation wise, it looked to be a good portion but the chicken was filled only in about half of the tortilla and the rest was not worth eating so basically half of the order/entre was an empty tortilla with a little cheese.  Not being a huge eater, I left hungry and hoping I had something at home to eat.   :(  I did see people eating nachos and large Mexican style pizza that looked great and large portions so maybe I try that next time. I will give it another shot."}
{"text":"Happy they are in Vegas. Excellent fresh Mexican food. Sustainable organic tasty. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Really great, fresh food!  They don't skimp on quality for sure!   The tacos and salad were delicious.  Really nice salsa bar too!"}
{"text":"Hmmm shocked with the positive rating. Food was not necessarily bad, it was just blah. No flavor, nothing special. Carne asada meat was bland. Tacos lacked flavor and onions and peppers were raw. Avocado even tasted grainy and old. I took off the avocado and raw onion and covered it in salsa to make it edible. Ultimately we were very disappointed with our meals. Considering Mexican food it not a rarity, I do not think you get get by with mediocre food."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Super fresh, avocados were on point. Had the fajita bowl and my wife had the Santa Fe burrito. You can whose which beans, rice, tortillas, everything when you order. There's a kids menu, kids meals come with a mini-churro. Fantastic lemonade selection. Initial interaction at the register was a little awkward, but then someone else came up and smiled at us and all further customer service interaction was excellent. The salsa bar was delicious, it's self serve. You pick your own table and order at the register when you're ready. My belly was happy with quality awesome food once we were done. Just finished the next day leftovers out of my fridge and it was still good. Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This was a pretty cool restaurant. Neat rustic style decor, great design! The food has good taste, I had the enchiladas and they were tasty, the sauce could use a bit of more seasoning, at least to my taste.  I will say for a brand new place to visit the customer service should be more inviting more warm... they were nice no doubt, but certainly not too hospitable.  Will certainly go back tho. Keep working on greatness"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and I am so thankful that they opened one out here. The food is absolutely delicious. The free chips and salsa bar make this place even better. The employees are very welcoming and friendly. The atmosphere is good and the place is very clean. I recommend getting the shrimp power plate because it is SO GOOD!! I actually live in Henderson, so this is quite the drive for me, but I would gladly do it again. I've already been twice since it's opened. I can't say enough good things about this place; I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for some great food with quality ingredients. Thanks Sharky's!"}
{"text":"My family and I were greeted by Devin with a warm welcome as soon as we walked in. This was our first time dining at this restaurant and definitely won't be our last! The food was as great as the customer service!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Sharky's! In Los Angeles we go there quite often, love the catering options and it was a shock to see one open recently in Summerlin. The quality food that Sharky's has to offer makes you feel good about eating out. Love the power plates, fish tacos, burritos, salads, quinoa options for gluten free family members and everything else! The fresh lemonades are also so refreshing. One of the employees named Shelby transferred to this location and it was so nice to be greeted by a familiar face from my local California store. Can't wait to eat here on future visits to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"My family and I had dinner here and the kids loved the items on the menu and my steak burrito was amazing. The staff was on point We will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Oh how I would of loved to have a Sharky's while I was in my late teens and 20's, those days when I was into my full-blown organic phase. Actually my 78 year old SoCal father would love this place and I should recommend it to him since he is the quinoa and brown rice type Filipino- I'm serious here. Although I do not subscribe to an organic lifestyle anymore, I do appreciate it and do like having options.  I came to Sharky's with a friend for an early dinner and ordered the Wild Salmon Lite Burrito. It's a wheat burrito filled with grilled wild salmon (not farmed), poblano organic brown rice, nori seaweed, cucumber, avocado and chili sesame seed oil. On it's own it is a bit bland but the salsa bar has a lot of different salsa to make that salmon burrito your very own. I tried different salsas and all of them were fresh and really kicked my burrito a few notches.   The burrito was very filling and I ate only half of it but maybe I was talking to my friend and got distracted. Either way, Sharky's is a great concept for those who are looking to have an organic lifestyle and eat out or for those who would just like that option even if it is for a night!"}
{"text":"Came to the soft opening 5/5/17. We were a big group so we got to try a lot of items on the menu. Steak burrito fiesta \"wet\" - big serving, came with chips and salsa delicious! Chipotle BBQ chicken stone fired pizza- its on a nice crisp tortilla crust and is so tasty! Nacho plate is great for sharing. You can get a two taco plate and mix and match what protein or taco style you like. Their guacamole and all their salsas are freshly made. Wonderful staff! Very attentive, offering their help with the menu, always checking up if we needed anything else."}
{"text":"It was very disappointing. The rice wasn't cooked and the service was terrible. They brought us our food and I asked if we could get silverware. The man that brought us our food said yes I'll get it but then never came back. He also said that my husbands food wasn't done yet. I went to get silverware myself after I noticed that he wasn't going to bring it and saw my husbands food waiting to be brought out. About five minutes later I noticed they weren't bringing out his food so I went to get it myself.  There was no excuse for the poor service as there was no one else in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The ingredients are organic and simple, easy to get something quick and healthy.  There's a small salad bar with salsa - and they had their own brewed tea that was good ."}
{"text":"Stopped in on 8/8/17 for the first time to place a to-go order.  I was especially interested in trying there food for the healthy and non-dairy options.  I ordered the half power plate with chicken and 2 sides (rice and beans) and had them add avocado which was extra.  I also paid for an additional side of yams which are hard to find at restaurants especially plain.  The portions were very generous and tasty!  Either the rice or beans had a kick to them but overall I like my food plain and non-spicy so it works for me. I also ordered the naked chicken tostada salad for my husband.  It's served on a tortilla shell instead of the bowl like you get at El Pollo Loco which he didn't realize.  Otherwise, he enjoyed it.  They also give you a bag of chips with a small container of guac and there are plenty of salsas to choose from.  I found the service to be very good and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"GREAT food, organic, fresh and ABSOLUTELY D-licious!!!!! With alcohol (artisanal beers, bottled and tap, red AND white wine sangrias) AND fresh squeezed fruit-ades!!!! Grilled shrimp was so fresh and sweet..... pulled pork succulent and smokin'.... all at fast food prices!!! Shout out to Devin, our server-extraordinaire, and the GREAT staff at Sharky's... you make fast food FUN again...."}
{"text":"Sharky's is AWESOME!  It's like a gourmet Chipotlé on steroids! Great set up, SUPER friendly staff (Emma rocks), good healthy eats, and you can't beat the price.  They have a salsa bar and the staff bring chips to your table, and provide refills, as needed.  Can't go wrong.  Go there.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here. It is interesting to say the least and seems to be suffering from an identity crisis. The menu is southern California Baja...Think Wahoo's on steroids. I walked in with no welcome or greeting. As I stood at the counter with my daughter, we checked out the menu and still not one \"hi\" or \"may I help you\". So, I took the initiative.   My daughter ordered a bean and cheese burrito, I ordered the two steak taco plate. The two taco plate come three ways. I told the guy at the counter that this was our first time here and asked for his recommendations. He suggested the California (basic taco... Lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and salsa).   Hint of cynicism coming next... So as he rings our order he asked if we were members of the addict club, their rewards program, it pained me to remind him again that this was our first time here.   There is not much to say about a bean and cheese burrito so I will move to the taco plate. It was good, but not all the hype people talk about. I'd like to comment on the salsa, but I think the tomatoes and onions that came with it are not considered salsa (maybe they are).   The staff is friendly, not with us or others, but among themselves they seem to be having a good time.   At the end of the day it is a quick serve, sit down restaurant with good, not amazing, food. The atmosphere is comfortable, clean, and modern... But personally, I wouldn't go out if my way to dine here."}
{"text":"The environment was so quaint with indoor dining & outside patio seating, we definitely enjoyed ourselves. The restaurant was able to accommodate our party very nicely & the service was absolutely impeccable!   I had no idea what to expect. But it had definitely succeed my expectations. I highly recommend those who are into a healthy twist of Mexican cuisine, to pay a visit here. My tummy & heart-eyes were very happy  & my camera was showing a lot of love that night, lol.  I tried pacing myself but everything that came out was so delicious! We were served tortilla chips, salsa & guacamole. Along with 3 types of lemonades & don't forget it's FRIDAY! 2 types of sangria. Additionally; fire stoned pizza, salads, burritos, tacos & power plates.. you name it! All diligently being informed on Sharky's history from Newport Beach & now expanded in Las Vegas along with thorough detail of each dish. Be sure to hit up their salsa bar & keep in mind they also have vegan options. Waaaay to go! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. I use to go to the Valencia, Ca location everyday after lunch and I love this place. Fresh meat, fresh everything. I highly recommend this to Vegas locals. This location it self is beautiful and customer service is great."}
{"text":"The food here is very good as well as all organic meats and veggies. There were also vegan options. This was a great find. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This isn't a Chipotle!  Thank goodness.  Sharky's has really friendly staff that was able to answer questions and give recommendations.  I had the fish of the day taco plate-grilled.  It was wonderful. The Mexican rice was great with the black beans.  I tried their tropical tea and that was even great!  Chips and salsa bar are complimentary with meal purchase.  Sangria, Margaritas and beer are available-several Mexican options and 805!  Thanks for joining us in Summerlin, Sharky's.  It appears that everything used is organic or wild caught fancy something or the other.  For people that need that stuff, they seem to be able to accommodate pretty much anyone."}
{"text":"Since discovering this restaurant my fiancé and I have eaten here many times. Friendly service and delicious fresh organic food! They have vegan options and fresh chips and salsa. This place is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Had the quesadilla. Super yummy!  I liked the presentation! The chips were good too. Hubs loved the salsa!"}
{"text":"We went there for lunch after seeing so many positive reviews.   Found the food to be tasteless and very expensive. I had a chicken burrito. In the competition shops, you get to choose the ingredients. Not here!  Plus for $11 you get a very small burrito on a tortilla that is so thin, it breaks apart in your hands.   My wife had their fajita bowl. Some rice, beans, tasteless chicken, (so much for their fire cooking adding taste).   Add two drinks, it was close to $25. You could feed a family somewhere else for that, and get a much better meal!  Tom from the shop, just offered to I guess provide us with some sort of certificate to try them again. That is very nice of you, but we will pass on the offer of more of your food for free. I was truthful in my review, and we do not care to come back."}
{"text":"This was my first time going here and I am so happy I decided to try it out ! I got the fiesta burrito with steak and it came with tortilla chips. It had so much flavor but not too many different flavors . There is a self serve salsa bar with homemade salsas. I would definitely recommend coming here !!!"}
{"text":"The huge nacho platters are what brought me in but the commitment to local and non-GMO produce, sustainably sourced fish, and healthy options will likely keep me coming back. Props for having calorie counts posted for every menu item!  The Nachos and Nachos Grande on the menu are different only in size, with your choice of protein and bean- the regular chicken with black beans was a huge portion more than sufficient for two to share, but I will say that I personally prefer more melty or liquid cheese on my nachos rather than just broiler-melted shredded cheese. That's a personal preference though. The tacos also have tons of choices: pick your protein, your tortilla, and then what style you'd like with toppings and sauces. The California style grilled shrimp was an excellent choice while the steak was seasoned well but fairly plain when ordered street-style.  I didn't much care for the Sharkys chicken salad I ordered but will note that even the half-size is pretty good sized with ample protein.  Menu also has protein combo plates, a couple of pizzas, and entree plates- the stacked chicken enchiladas in particular look tasty. Don't forget to add on a watermelon basil lemonade, which was tasty without being too sweet and similar to an agua fesca. They also offer beer and wine.  Service was attentive and friendly, we were offered drink samples and checked on a couple of times. The outside patio is nicely shaded and there's a bar area inside with a TV. Check out their salsa bar around the back area by the drinks, the spicy orange one is my favorite!"}
{"text":"All I can say is - overrated!!!!  It's basically an upgraded chipotle with more drink options. It was so uneventful, I deleted the pics I took.  Need to say more!!!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place out but we are certainly disappointed. The food was very average and bland. The restaurant has a large menu and we ordered several dishes (nachos, fajitas bowl, tacos, kids's quesadilla) to share. They have a salsa bar which was nice. I don't think we will return soon."}
{"text":"first time here. met my bookclub for our monthly discussion and didn't have high expectations of the place. however, Sharky's staff is wonderful. Justin sat down and chatted with us, he made us feel at home and even comped us samples of red and white sangria. which was super sweet of him. many of us had never been here although we've driven by many times. so we're discussing our book, eating, by the way, the california tacos are muy tasty. and the bbq chicken pizza has thin crust which we all loved. and the price is super reasonable. I had a pinot noir, 2 california tacos with generous salad and chips and guac for $17. when we were talked out and full, the GM came over and chatted with us. He was also, super kind. I'm raving about the place because it's worthy of praise. Great job staff, Justin and GM."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time.  Ordered the ahi fish tacos with pinto beans and Mexican rice. My friend ordered the steak tacos.  I tried his and the steak was tender and flavorful. The staff is great and friendly.  Food came quickly and was fresh.  I want to go back soon and try other stuff as I was not disappointed with what I ordered this time.  I recommend you try this place if you want some fresh mex."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and the staff is very warm and friendly. Their salsa bar is great, and so is their pineapple lemonade. Their roasted veggie bowl is delicious!  Great place!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for fresh quick meals with a nice selection of healthier choices. I've ordered the roasted veggie salad and the tostada salad and both were great and very filling. Tried one of their green juices too which was delicious, definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"For a fast casual chain restaurant charging 4+ dollars for a basic taco is seriously ridiculous lol the fajita steak taco even cost $5.39 I've never seen tacos cost this much even at a nice sit down Mexican restaurant or the more \"gourmet taco\" places in town. Good but not worth the money at all."}
{"text":"I'm trying to figure out if this restaurant is trying to go out of the way to anger regular customers. My wife, daughter and I come here 2-3 times a month. I've progressively seen the service go south. Tonight my daughter wanted Sharky's and I was happy to say yes. As usual I ordered the Santa Fe burrito and proceeded to the salsa bar. I asked Chris (assuming he's the manager) if I could please get 1 larger container for my salsa. I usually get one because I love the guacamole salsa and hate taking 7 plus containers of the tiny salsa cups. He said he could not give me one. I told him I've received them in the past so I don't waste so much plastic. He told me he could sell me a plastic container. What??? Sell me a plastic container a few ounces bigger than the salsa cups. Sell me??? I didn't realize this place sold Tupperware. I asked him how much and he didn't answer me. I filled a ton of cups and decided I was going to ask again. I was told a plastic container is $3.50 each. It's hard to believe that we spent $28 on dinner and I can't get a $0.10 container. By the way...the steak was not to be found in tonight's burrito. For an empty restaurant I cannot understand how hard it is to go a little bit above and beyond for a customer. I also feel it's fair to mention the group of employees congregating per the picture I'll include with this post. If the don't want to be here maybe they shouldn't be here."}
{"text":"Try the power plate! I got the steak one and the meat is so tender. The yams (sweet potatoes?) are so fluffy and not too sweet. It just has the perfect natural sweetness and not that horrible dessert sticky sweet taste like at Thanksgiving. We also tried the chicken quesadilla. If you want something naughty, that's it. So much cheese but oh so good. A basic done just right. I loved all the choices at the salsa bar too.  The staff is so warm and friendly. Ask them what's good that day and they won't steer you wrong. Come see John and say hi!"}
{"text":"I live and breathe for Sharky's. The tostada salad is at least two meals. The shrimp tacos and the fajita tacos are friggin great. I will eat 10 lbs of their original salsa - I personally mix in a bit of the avocado salsa too. They aren't actually spicy. But like, my god, they taste good. They used to have a watermelon mint drink that was outstanding. The new ones are good enough, but I'm just waiting for more watermelon. The people are also super nice, and if you come around lunch, you'll see that they often eat their own food, which is a good sign.  Just like, go there. Get the app because you'll probably come back. Eat in store for bottomless chips and salsa. Idk what else to say. It's good."}
{"text":"The entire staff was extremely friendly and made us feel welcomed. The food was very very tasty and fresh. All their food is organic and non-gmo and the prices are very reasonable reflecting that. I was sad to see mac shack go but I think this will be my favorite place now. We are already planning a trip back there because the food was just that good and the menu is diverse so you can't get bored of it. See y'all soon"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Fun environment, but the music is a bit too loud for easy conversation. Nice people working there.   Fish tacos - mahi mahi grilled nicely. But too much sauce. I recommend ordering without any sauce. Big servings, so go easy on the sides, and please think twice about a 3rd taco.   Salads - are big with fresh ingredients. Plenty of options here....but ask for dressing on the side. They treat salad bowls like swimming pools for veggies.   Salsa bar is nice, but the salsas lack flavor,  just adds moisture."}
{"text":"Love this place! Not only does the food taste good, but there are a lot of healthy options too! I like their pineapple lemonade! And protein combos when I'm in the mood for something quick and healthy! It's nice to have the option to sit down and stay for my healthy meal. They also give you free chips while you wait and have a free salsa bar. I'm hungry thinking about it :)"}
{"text":"Here AGAIN! Love the food and the staff Keep getting the same thing ... tempura fish tacos. So good"}
{"text":"Lemonades are divine. Any place in Vegas with a organic, non GMO menu is always a must, and the food is spectacular. Service is genuinely friendly, with it starting from a greeting at the  door. Portions pack a lot of bang for their buck, and the ambiance is delightfully casual. Will definitely return.  And ORDER THE #!$@#$& lemonade."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I've heard this place was really good and it lived up to the expectations.   I got the Fiesta Burrito with chicken and it was very good. Great flavor, and tasted fresh.  Service was really good. Fast and friendly, and the restaurant was clean and organized."}
{"text":"First of all we had some of the BEST SERVICE I've ever recieved at a restaurant. Wow! Shelby was incredibly knowledgeable, friendly, helpful and just awesome.  The FOOD was really, really tasty. I can't wait to eat here again.  The ATMOSPHERE is very modern with great music that isn't played so loudly that you can't have a nice conversation. It's remarkably clean everywhere even at the serve yourself salsa bar and drink station.  They're new to Vegas so let's give them some love!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Please forgive me as I write a review that'll sound like a wedding speech... but I love this place. Like, LOVE LOVE.   I went here for the first time many months ago and had no idea what to order. The employees (to this day) are extremely kind and patient and always have great recommendations. (My favorite is the half Numex with chicken!)   Now, I try to at least once a week. I usually stick with my usual but every once in awhile I ask the employee their favorite order and get that -- I have yet to have a bad meal or experience.   The silver lining? The place is always clean and spotless.   I LOVE SHARKY'S! Till death do us part."}
{"text":"It was slightly difficult for me to choose what to order because of how delicious everything on their menu sounded. For those who are health conscious with what they eat, this place is perfect for you! They even put the caloric value next to the item on the menu. Endless organic, healthy selections on their menu from grilled chicken, angus steak, tofu, salmon, shrimp, etc. You can substitute according to your preference!  The place had plenty of seating (booth, high chairs, outdoor seating), beautiful lighting, always replenished salsa bar, beer on tap, red and white sangrias, lemonades, and fountain drinks.   Had the pleasure to meet the owner at the time I visited their restaurant. Such a nice guy! Very personable and definitely made efforts to entertain and connect with his guests.  My favorite thing about this place is how they give back to the community. They raise awareness for a cause called \"No Kid goes Hungry!\" which I believe a portion of their earnings as a company goes to them. I love a business that shares their blessings.  I lost my mind when I saw how huge the serving of the nachos were. Imagine those platters that you put a pizza in, that entire thing loaded with nachos and a mountain of toppings (Pico, Beans of your choice, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, jalapeños, and your choice of protein). It was enough to serve five people comfortably unless you're really, REALLY hungry.   A friend of mine ordered the Chipotle BBQ Chicken Pizza. Its made with a really thin crust similar to a nacho chip which made it really crunchy. Though I'm not a very big fan of bbq flavored things, this meal was delicious. The flavors stood out in every bite. They were generous with their toppings too.   Definitely RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Salsa bar is great!! Prices are high for the food, customer service is good and they have sangria made from scratch. They offer many different protein with your meals"}
{"text":"WOW!! Being a great fan of Mexican food Sharky's is  great addition to Las Vegas! Their food is fresh and delicious. You will not find the standard deep fried food on the menu. You will find an organic tofu and veggies burrito, you will find an Angus Beef burrito (antibiotic free, no hormones) and a taco plate with several options.  I had the Mahi Mahi tempura style fish tacos with spanish rice and pinto beans! AMAZING! We also shared the Chipotle BBQ Chicken pizza, a wonderful crisp concoction of Chipotle BBQ sauce, 4 cheeses, tomatoes, cilantro, red onion, green onion, all on a chipotle tortilla crust with tender chicken. Also if you like salads try the Harvest Quinoa! Organic red and white quinoa, baby greens, apples, strawberries, dried cranberries, and blueberries, golden raisins, pecans, almonds, goat cheese and sprinkled with toasted flax and chia seeds and tossed with a  sweet lemon vinaigrette sauce.  And the lemonade is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!! Had the Hibiscus with ginger!! Great casual vibe with tables and booths."}
{"text":"A few friends and I decided to check this place out after seeing it was recently opened!  The place took over the former Mac Shack location and it's well renovated, has a cozy feel to it inside and there's a patio outside which was nice because we brought our dog. Plus they have lighter options for almost everything on the menu.   Service 5/5  The place didn't seem to be too busy, with only one other family eating inside. Came in about 830 PM and there was plenty of staff. While we were sitting down on the patio they brought us extra chips and asked us if we needed anything a few more times which was greatly appreciated.   Food 3/5  My friends and I ordered a nacho platter, tostada, and a mahi mahi burrito. The nacho platter was ginormous! My friend and I shared the mahi mahi burrito with no beans. I can only describe it as decent really, nothing to write home about. Wasn't too fishy but it was also kind of small. It did taste a lot better smothered in salsa.   Value 3/5 Nacho platter + beer came out to around 24 bucks which is kind of pricey considering all the other options around the area. The nachos were ginormous though. Burrito + guac was 12 bucks, again a little on the higher price range.   Overall 4/5  tl;dr - decent Mexican food with good service at a price. Not sure I'll be back but I did have a pleasant time while I was there."}
{"text":"Good new addition to the area, the salsa bar is what really makes it stand out. All the employees have been friendly when I've been there."}
{"text":"After reading other reviews, my family and I made the trek to the Boca park area of Summerlin and realized that Sharkey's took over the Mac Shack space. I was expecting a Chipotle style dining experience and was met with an order at the counter and wait to be delivered to your table.  No worries! We browsed the menu and chose a variety of items for our group.  Food was delivered on waves for our party of six. Of course my dish arrived several minutes after everyone else. The food was definitely prepared with fresh and what is advertised as organic ingredients. I ordered the Nacho Grande which I wish someone would have told me it feeds 4 to 6 people. I had 3 meals out of this dish with all the leftovers. Bean and cheese burrito was pretty weak and small. Mom was not happy with her order.  My kids did not care for the menu choices but they are special and not very adventurous.   I liked the salsa bar offerings and the staff was friendly. I wish they would have guided me differently in my menu choices but what ever. I enjoyed the food and would return when in the area but I am sure my family will unanimously oppose.  So if any one wants to meet for lunch one day...message me."}
{"text":"After training, me and a couple of friends were hungry and looking for a clean meal to eat tongue us for the next training session. We saw Sharky's and figured that would be a good meal that was on the healthier side.  It is a very clean and modern, and quite refreshing to escape the heat. You order at the counter, and wait for your meal to be served to you. They have a salsa bar with a lot of salsas as well.  With your meal you get free chips. This chips are decent, and the salsas are good. Had one of each but none were hot, including the \"Killer Hot\".  I has a steak burrito, and it was okay. Honestly, I could barely taste the steak amongst the other ingredients. It also didn't sit well with my stomach.  My friends had a steak and chicken plate, and neither finished their plates, and they normally clean their plates. So it was very underwhelming. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Ok! I see you young college grad that ventured off to make a name for yourself so you won't be forever known as the products of Mrs. Moes and Mr. Blaze. You look just like your mother though with the easy breezy ordering and salsa bar. You have your dad's since of style with the create your own fire grills added to the menu. But my my my if you haven't established yourself and your name by having vegan, veggie and gluten free options. I smashed my entire burrito and didn't feel guilty or still hungry, I see you girl! You're of age now with the small bar selection and flavored drinks. Proud of you, see you soon."}
{"text":"Over priced and overrated. Service was okay, however, the food was just disappointing. $30+ for tacos and some bland rice and beans, no thank you. There are so many other good places for tacos in this city for way less then that."}
{"text":"I want to like this place more than I do. They tout healthier food and I can get a glass of wine for $6. I came in with the fam and tried the salmon power bowl. In short, NOT WORTH THE $15. The rice was whatever, beans way undercooked and had the consistency of eating peanuts and side of veg was a plate of onions with two coins of squash and 2 strips of bell pepper mixed in. As for the salmon? I think they're trying to pass off Arctic Char as salmon cuz it did not taste or have the texture like salmon... I get that this place is new but some of the staff don't seem to have their stuff together. The first cashier that rang me up had to find others for assistance a couple times. It was like a bad scene in a movie.   Otherwise, The nachos weren't bad and my wife liked here burrito. The kids didn't seem to mind their kids bowls. Dunno if I would try this spot again. Dropping $70 for a fast casual meal that isn't very good isn't exactly something I'd rush out to do.    040818 update... Tried to give this place a try one more time after some friends said it's pretty good and worked out it's grand opening kinks... nope. I ordered a chicken bowl, black beans and corn tortilla. Instead I get mostly chicken bowl with rogue pieces of beef, pinto beans and flour tortillas. Did I just get someone's leftovers tossed together? Why did I even bother to order? If they can't even do a simple bowl order properly I dunno what to make of this joint. Wahoos is across the street with better service, less expensive and better portions. I hope this place goes out of business soon and makes way for something better than this lame excuse for a fast casual joint..."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a very pleasant time at Sharky's while vacationing in Las Vegas. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable, the nachos were fantastic topped generously with high quality veggies, beans, meat, cheese and guac. There was a good beer selection along with white and red sangria which was fun to see.  My next trip to Vegas I will definitely be coming back. We would appreciate you guys coming to Denver :)"}
{"text":"Organic Fiesta burrito with the added Wet style... YUM! This thing is huge,and they definitely don't skip on the good stuff, loaded with guacamole, cheese etc... My wife got the tostada which is more like a massive taco salad. Amazing! Glad to have a place to pick up a fast, healthy option right after my Whole Foods run which is conveniently next door."}
{"text":"Gone here a few times and this last visit I found out my California card was good here as long as I had registered it. The young lady checked by my phone number and I was given points towards a future purchase. Wish that I knew this the last couple of times I've been here, but I was never asked before. The food is fresh and they have a great salsa bar. Hubby and I usually order the steak nachos to share. This time they didn't really impress me. There were a few little scattered steak pieces on the $18.00. + pan. We asked the young lady to come look and she did and went to ask the cook, he said he had put the required \"3 scoops\". She did order extra steak at no charge and had it brought out to us. The presentation was nice but it appears they are very tight with the toppings now. I think for what they gave it was overpriced. Portions for $ was a fail here this time.  I appreciate that I received a message indicating that they would put a credit on my rewards card as well as give me the missing points from my previous visits. Thank you David Goldstein, we will return to share another lunch when we are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Really fresh and tasty food. A small, but respectable variety of drinks. Both indoor and outdoor seating. Justin was there to not only greet my friends and I before the soft open, but also provided suggestions on what to order and was very personable. The GM, Enrique, was also very personable and helpful with suggestions on ordering. There were several other staff members whose names escape me, but were extremely helpful and made sure everything was OK. The staff was also very helpful in pointing out that there was a salsa station and brought out plenty of warm chips which I couldn't stop eating. My steak fajita bowl was very good and the steak had a really good flavor to it. My overall experience was excellent and I see myself going back very soon."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place that I had to try it myself. For starters, the establishment is really nice and very clean. It seemed as if the employees were always active and cleaning as they moved around the restaurant.  It took me a few minutes to acclimate myself with the menu but the with some assistance from the employee at the register I made the right decision for my dinner. I ended up choosing the surf and turf burrito for myself and a happy hour taco for my son and a 2 taco plate for my fiancé. The burrito was big, along with the shrimp in it. The steak in the burrito was tasty too. My son skipped the taco because he was full on candy but my fiancé couldn't say enough good things about the 2 taco plate. One thing I wanted to highlight again is that employees are very friendly and extra helpful for the indecisive like me. They took their time out to greet me and explain the menu. And it made my visit easy and enjoyable. I'll visit one more time before giving a 5th star! Keep up the great work. We'll see you soon"}
{"text":"Had an outstanding late dinner at Sharkeys last night.  I was impressed at how clean it was as the floor was spotless and the tabletops gleamed.  Ordering was fast and painless with the menu promenently displayed  and their passion for wholesome, locally grown and organic ingredients set forth. The food was delivered promptly and hot.  The silverware was spotless - which pleased my wife to no end.  She hates either having to ask for cleam silverware or wiping water spots off the utensils. The large steak nachos was outstanding with plenty of black beans and delicious tidbits of steak.  The burittos were also outstanding with lots of chicken and a fresh wrap. And the helpfulness and friendliness of the staff must not be overlooked.  Their attention and courtesy were well appreciated. A shout-out to Devon who helped us with ordering by offering great suggestions."}
{"text":"Really great tacos the chicken tasted fresh right from the grill and was amazing. The nachos are out of this world and the steak was tender and well seasoned everything was perfect."}
{"text":"Delish. Get the pizza - crisp thin crust. Fresh salsa bar awesome. Had cali tacos - fresh but not super flavorful. Sides good"}
{"text":"About time the opened one in Vegas. The nachos are huge. The food is awesome. Missed coming here since moving from So Cal!"}
{"text":"Went last night with a party of 16. Staff was extremely accommodating and friendly. The restaurant was tastefully done. You order and they bring the food to you.The turn around time was efficient especially since we were a large group. The food was delicious and there is something tasty for the biggest carnivore to a vegan. Chips are complimentary and there is a salsa and fixings bar. Portions are generous. They also serve wine and beer. This one will certainly be a good back again and I am pretty certain the whole group felt the same way. Very positive experience."}
{"text":"So cool and so many options. Reminds me of Chipotle... but better. I had the Spicy pizza which was cheese and tomatoes and sauce on a crispy tortilla. I wasn't expecting that but it was great. And the watermelon-basil lemonade, very refreshing. The girl behind the register was so enthusiastic. Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"This was our first time going to Sharky's. It was delicious! I had the chicken taquitos and my wife had the fajita bowl. Both were tasty and the ingredients they use seemed so fresh. We also tried the watermelon basil lemonade which was great. We will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Sharky's is a wonderful restaurant. Almost all the food was good. With all the good things there is bad things. The restaurant differs in options. The place is also vegan-friendly. Make sure that your waiter/waitress understands your order or this will happen. In general, the restaurant is quick and delicious. Everybody is friendly.     Best of luck to this growing restaurant."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and Mexican food together? Best thing ever. Great service and an awesome menu!! I highly recommend the nacho steak!! Enough to feed a family!! Great price and great food!! I am so coming back!"}
{"text":"Every time I've been here has been fantastic! The staff are extremely prompt and friendly. I love their salsa bar. The food itself is perfectly cooked, and lots of healthy options for those going that route. Perfect spot to get a quick and delicious bite"}
{"text":"It's a little hard to find if you're not looking for it, it's right behind the claim jumper. The food was amazing and surprisingly light for it to be Mexican food. The staff was great, Devin was very pleasant and explained the menu and answered our questions with ease. He also provided samples of their fountain drinks. We tried the horchata and the hibiscus green tea. The horchata tastes like any other horchata but the hibiscus green tea was top notch. I ordered the veggie bowl with salmon and without the quinoa. The salmon was perfectly good practically melted on the fork. I ordered the quesadillas for the kids and they devoured it. Which is a shocker because they're picky little humans. My husband ordered the chicken fiesta burrito and it left him speechless. Only complaint would be that the green sauce wasn't spicy enough just tasted plain. The experience overall was great, it's very clean, offers vegan and vegetarian options, and provides military discounts. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Good service, great food! A bit pricy though, $16 for a steak burrito and strawberry lemonade.. You feel obligated to tip, so it's really $20.. But it's worth it  Exciting to finally have a Sharky's in LV!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are on vacation and noticed that Sharky's was the hot new place on Yelp. Since she was craving tacos, we decided to give it a shot!   We each ordered steak tacos; I ordered the original, she ordered the fajita. We also ordered the chicken taquitos. We ordered To-Go, and even though they said it would be ready in ten minutes, we arrived between about 15-20 minutes after placing the order and still had to wait about 5-10 minutes before receiving our food. A little odd considering the place was practically empty.  We got back to the hotel and started chowing down! The tacos come in little shark-shaped holders, which is cute--each one individually labeled. The steak in these tacos is delicious! It's not a dominating flavor, but very subtle, and melds very well with the rest of the flavors. As for the chicken taquitos, they were rather dry. The chicken did have good flavor though, so that's a plus!   A minor complaint is that when we received our order at the restaurant, there's wasn't any silverware or napkins in our bag. I don't mind having to get my own silverware from beside a drink machine, but since it can be rather difficult to get utensils while in a hotel room, I wish either (A) we were informed about the absence of silverware in the bag, or (B) already had the silverware in the bag to begin with. I expect to have to get my own utensils from a place like Chipotle, not Sharky's--and that's a good thing.  Overall, if you're in the area, give Sharky's a shot! They've got some good food. Get the steak, avoid the taquitos, and have yourself a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Came to Sharky's after seeing they had some vegan options and it did not disappoint! I got the fajitas with tofu and no sour cream and it was delicious! The sangria was not bad either! The service was quick and the food was hot and freshly made! My friend got the tostada with chicken and said it was great! I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"We were looking for someplace delicious to eat that was off the Strip. Sharky's did not disappoint. Great food and outstanding service! Everyone was so friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. The free chips and the salsa bar were top notch! Wish we had a place like this back home."}
{"text":"I met up with some friends here for dinner and was impressed with most of what I tried. I guess this is a known place in California, but new to Nevada and this was my first experience at a Sharky's location and it certainly will not be my last! They have a good amount of seating inside as well on the patio outside. The patio outside is dog friendly. You place your order at the counter and they bring your order to you when it's ready. Staff was really friendly and happy to answer questions and make adjustments to some items ordered.   Nachos Grande Steak ($18.79) - 4 cheeses, organic beans, guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo and jalapenos on a huge ass pile of chips. I mean huge! Several people can easily share these nachos. I felt there could have been a scoop or 2 more of guac given the amount of chips there was and some of the cheese wasn't as melted on some areas as it was on others, but these nachos really were well liked by all in our group and the steak has good flavor.   4 Cheese Steak Quesadilla ($11.69) - Wow this tasted great! Hubby and I both loved this a lot. There was a nice amount of steak and cheese and it's a good size. The quesadilla came with a side of sour cream and guacamole.    Spicy 4 Cheese Pizza ($8.49) - Tomatillo cheese sauce, tomatoes, cilantro, red onion and sour cream on a jalapeno-cilantro tortilla crust. I had to try this because I love pizza and it just sounded so different. I did end up liking it there was a fair amount of cheese and the crispy tortilla crust was good.  They also have tacos, burritos, salads, power plates and soup on the menu."}
{"text":"It was slow on a Saturday afternoon, so I thought Id try this place out. Only one tv, and it is self-service, so that was a little disappointing since I didnt know what to expect. They only had like 5 draft beer options, and none was Budweiser or Miller Lite. Service was a little slow, which was odd because they must have had like 20 employees in there! The nachos were huge and tasty and food was fairly-priced. It's ok for what it is. It's a part of a shopping center, so don't expect a sprawling layout."}
{"text":"We sort of liked this place and it is fast food. Good salsa bar. The steak burrito was a little light on meat. The chicken  in the taquitos was minced and you couldn't really tell it was chicken. Time will tell if we come back."}
{"text":"Oh, man, I really did not like this place. It's not the decor, or ambience, or the attitude of the staff. That was amazing. But the food is deceptively  unhealthy. I know they say it is organic and natural and all that. But I have never been so bloated as I was after that meal! It could have been the extraordinarily greasy tortilla chips. Or too much salt in the salsas.  Or maybe something more insidious in the food. (Manufacturers can include a lot of additives in food and still be called \"organic.\") I don't know what it is, but I would not chance it again. It made my weight overnight balloon up 6 pounds! (I had nothing else that day that would have done that). It's just not worth it for what is ultimately pretty mediocre Mexican food. Skip this one."}
{"text":"Finally we have a Sharky's in Vegas!  Many of my Cali people talk about this place so I was excited about trying it out and especially after looking over their menu.  This is the first \"chain\" restaurant offering organic, natural, and wild caught foods. Major plus for me!  ATMOSPHERE: Located in the Boca Park area in the same plaza with Whole Foods, when I walked into Sharky's I loved the layout. Lots of seating available, along with a little bar like area although I only saw beer and wine options. Nice TV located at the bar to catch a game while you grab  a bite.   FOOD:  The best thing about this place! Went after the gym, so I got the veggie bowl with wild caught salmon added on, and a watermelon basil lemonade to wash it down. Chips are complimentary here, and truly I fell in love once I tried the salsa bar (see my profile I love me some salsa) the avocado and killer hot salsa are amazing! I had to wait maybe 7-10 mins for my food, which if you ask me is a GOOD sign, I like my food made fresh. It arrived piping hot, nice bowl and all brussel sprouts were cooked nicely, as was the quinoa, and the flavor was great not too salty and not bland. My salmon was good as well, had to pour my salsa on it to really take it up a notch. I'll definitely be going back to try the pizza and salads. Love that they have a \"low calorie menu\" and list nutrional info.   CUSTOMER SERVICE: I was greeted when I walked and staff also said goodnight when I walked out. Also was offered to sign up as a member (which, duh I did) and my food was brought to me. Very friendly and easy going staff. Salsa bar was kinda messy though, probably the only area that needed attention.   Overall I'll definitely be going back to Sharky's talk about a great first impression. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because of pricing,  but I understand going organic and natural can be pricy. Still, hands down much better than Chipotle for all my gym rats, go to Sharky's if you can."}
{"text":"Good food! A little pricey but that's to be expected with higher quality ingredients. The staff is really friendly as well. Nachos are good, and both the Sharky's Quinoa Salad and Roasted Vegetable Salad were both very good."}
{"text":"Great service, fresh food, giant nachos, customizable orders, and boxes that fit your order (box for nachos is not the same as box for taco salad)"}
{"text":"I don't do reviews but this one was unfortunate. I went in on Sunday for my lunch break and order 2 original chicken tacos with an Horchata. With the price I paid I definitely was expecting the food to be appetizing but unfortunately it was not. My corn tortilla wasn't fully warmed i know because it fell apart before i could eat it and was sticking to the wrapper and my drink well could definitely be way better. Next time I'll just stick to Roberto's lol"}
{"text":"The food here was FANTASTIC! I had the tempura mahi mahi burrito and it was amazing! There were 4 adults that ordered food and everyone loved their meal. My only complaint would be the kids mini churro they get with their meals. They were super dry and had a terrible flavor. This wouldn't deter me from eating there again, I just won't order a kids meal.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Me and the bf visited Sharky's this week for dinner since our fridge is broken and we don't want to deal with being wasteful for food. The first attempt they were working out some kitchen issues, so we went to another place. However, we came back the next day and they greeted us with \"you came back!\". That was nice they remembered us. They took a small discount off our bill for the inconvenience which was much appreciated. The food was generous portions and we both got fajita bowls that were pretty healthy. Great salsa's and hot sauces to choose from, and had great beer on tap and in cans! (21st Amendment is my fave!) It's sit down and they bring out your food, and they were super attentive to asking if we wanted more chips or to-go boxes. They have a good variety on their menu and most of it is very health conscious. We will be back for sure! Glad to have it in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We purposely waited for happy hour to go in to Sharkeys and have my favorite Sangria and happy hour priced food and when we got there they were out of the sangria; this is not the first time.  Towards the end of the night, it's often sparse in items & chaotic. This needs to be shifted to get my 5 stars."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place, but it's just more of the same. It's more of an upscale version of El Pollo Loco meets Chipotle . I loathe the fast food Mexican, and this place doesn't offer anything extra except a bar, beer and Sangria. They're as expensive as the actual dine-in Mexican spots. They have a \"salsa\" bar (nothing exciting), but, it's basically just like all the other \"fresh Mexican\" chains around. We've got at least 6 within a 1 mile radius of Boca Park: Cafe Rio, Baja Fresh, Chipotle, El Pollo Loco, Hussong's, and Viva Mercadito. This place won't make it, unfortunately. Their prices are too high, food is just mediocre, and Summerlin has too many other great spots to dine at."}
{"text":"News flash: The burrito bowl at Chipotle never was, and never will be, all that healthy. If you have come to this realization and are in search of a fast casual Mexican eatery that does deliver on the healthy factor, Sharky's is your spot. Sure, there are nachos, burritos and even pizzas to go buck wild on, but they also have a whole Naked menu and then some mix-and-matchable Power Plates. My lunch group all opted for the Wild Caught Salmon Power Plate, with me going for Organic Poblano Rice and Organic Black Beans for sides. (The Organic Yucatán Yams received RAVE reviews as well.) It was a fresh, filling and really \"clean\" meal by typical fast casual standards - not spicy, but tasty. The salsa bar is also money, with 5 or 6 housemade offerings ranging from avocado salsa to fire-roasted. And the red sangria was actually light and not overly sweet - would make a fab summer drink in my book. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Mexican food but this place makes the best fish taco I've ever tasted. This place is super clean and staff are very attentive. Manager Enrique welcomes everyone that comes through the door."}
{"text":"This place is excellent I love the ambiance and the food and staff. They gave away free food to everyone before they opened and now out of gratitude I keep going back. Great job"}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome as usual.Devin and Richard waited on us this time. There was a mistake in our order but they went out of their way to take care of the situation...Talk about amazing customer service and outstanding quality food."}
{"text":"So much to choose from on menu! Organic, GMO free! Been waiting for more restaurants like this to open in Vegas! Had salad w/chicken, nice portion, very filling, looked & tasted fresh as well. Delicious salsa variety at bar too. Great service, very friendly, will be back very soon with friends & family! Super cool decor as well, not your usual healthy food joint."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh and healthy Mexican food. Filling but all the ingredients are fresh so I feel revived, not sluggish.   The fish taco is probably one of the best I've ever had. Husband said the chicken tacos with fajita was phenomenal. Burrito was good but since the tacos were outrageous, the burrito was an after thought.   They have burritos, tacos, salads, and some favorites plus kids menu.   We will be back."}
{"text":"Good place for lunch, they have couple vegan option, lots of salsa for free and the food is tasty. You get what you paid for. I will be back to try more."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. But service could be more customer oriented. Had the enchilada stack and the pizza both were very well done. Satisfied my Mexican and pizza fix for the night."}
{"text":"Mexican food is one of my favorites and I was excited to see the Mac Shack (which I didn't care for) replaced by a potential good new place.  When my wife and I first entered and saw the walk up and order counter, my expectations took a hit towards the negative and I thought, \"Crap...  I wonder if it's the same owners just trying Mexican food now?\"   I like to sit down, have a waitress or waiter, etc. so, was a strike here.  Next, the prices were sit down and have a  waitress or waiter prices as well as far as I was concerned but we were there and going to move forward with things.  We ordered away, and found ourselves a seat  with a slight detour to the salsa bar on the way to the table (we were given a small thing of chips) and we munched while we waited and the salsas tasted pretty good.    Well, the food came out relatively quickly and I must say, we really enjoyed it. The chicken fajita style tacos I had were really tasty and my wife and I shared a large nacho which was pretty decked out and tasty as well. Further, she had some quinoa salad of some sort that she enjoyed.      Overall, the food was the real star of this place and it was tasty.  I wasn't too fond of the process previous to that."}
{"text":"I was a little bummed to learn that this place has nothing to do with the mascot of my favorite, San Jose-based hockey team. The food made up for that disappointment.  Sharky's Woodfired Mexican Grill is a rather extensive SoCal chain that has recently started to expand into the Las Vegas area. In spite of the high-priced focus on the popular \"food-conscious\" buzzwords (organic, non-GMO, local), as well as the lengthy drive from my home base of Henderson, I decided to give them a shot so that I could meet up with some Yelp friends for dinner.  The place seems inviting with a lot of relatively light-colored wood decor, and there is an outdoor patio which we utilized, with weather surprisingly appropriate for the onset of autumn. It's an order-then-sit casual spot, not a full service restaurant, and there was a decent wait in line (much of which was our group's fault).   Owing to California law, they have calories listings for each menu item and have left that bit of info intact for the Nevada menu. If I'd been awake and aware enough to do the math, I could've guessed that I was about to over-order in my zeal to taste a wide variety of proteins. I did mostly stick to tacos, rather than burritos filled with goodies or plates laden with rice and sides, but it still got pretty crazy when I tasted some of the larger portioned items which others had ordered.  Complimentary tortilla chips, with various complimentary salsas from the bar: the whole thing reminds me of Rubio's, which is a good thing in light of this restaurant being a chain. The chips are crunchy and don't taste stale. The salsas are all fresh and all taste pretty good, but they're very cautiously rated, with a \"mild\" pico de gallo not having the least hint of spiciness, and the house and tomatillo salsas, both of which are medium, tasted rather mild. And I'm not a spicy food-tolerant eater, so maybe I really should've delved into the \"hot\" salsas.  Nachos Grande with Steak ($18.79): this monster could feed a small family easily. The ingredients in my \"sample size\" portion (thanks, Christie L!) tasted fresh. The steak in particular was tender, properly seasoned, and just delicious overall. It's likely the star of the menu in general.  Spicy 4 Cheese \"Pizza\" ($8.49): I'd question crispy fried tortilla's stature as pizza, but even if you consider this a gigantic oversized nacho, the cheese blend and the supporting cast make this an excellent entree or shared portion. I might order it for myself again should I get around to a Sharky's. Thanks again to Christie for sharing a slice.  Chipotle BBQ Chicken \"Pizza\" ($10.69): the only other member of this section of the menu. I only really tried this after it got cold (thanks LJ R for waistline-watching), so I can't fully comment on the flavors, but it seems like a pretty safe bet if you like BBQ chicken pizza, albeit a bit boring. Maybe the fresh, hot version has a more easily identified mix of flavors.  I won't really delve into the tacos ($4.39-$5.19) separately because my overall opinion is that they were mostly underwhelming. The corn tortillas are disappointingly uncooked and contribute nothing, while the flour tortillas have some flavor and seem to stay more intact if left alone for more than a few minutes. The shredded cheese, present on all of my choices, wasn't impressive. The chicken and mesquite-grilled proteins (salmon and shrimp, in my case) had nothing going for them save for decent texture. I had to use complimentary salsas for flavor.  The tempura battered mahi mahi was the only interesting protein of my plate. In short, if you're desperate to get tacos, choose flour tortillas, and pick tempura battered fish or steak. Oh, and they're large 6-inch tortillas, not typical 4-inch street food tacos.  Sharky's was a disappointment in multiple regards, but they really impressed me with anything that had melted cheese and/or steak (so read this as a 3.5* rounded up kinda thing). I'd go back for those particular components, as well as the tempura-fried seafoods, but I'll steer clear of anything else."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come in and try this place for a few months since I saw they were opened. Finally give it a try today... took a bite of the salmon (super fishy... in a bad way), a bite of the rice (absolutely no flavor) and one bite of the beans (completely bland) and walked out! The decor is really cool and the employees were extremely friendly but the food was REALLY bad! I was super bummed because I really wanted to like it but I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Nachos were good.  Got the Nachos Grande and it was huge enough to feed 3 people.  Nice salsa bar also with lots of choices.  Staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Great chips! Would come back just for that. But wait, there's more. The staff was sooo friendly, which is what convinced me to write the review and give the stars. It's texmex but better than what I've had other places. The chips, did I mention they're great, are hand made and have some kind of lime/salt on them. Really good! We had to ask for a second round. They also have a salsa bar which I tried most of, but not all. Very good pico de gallo. We'll go back and suggest you give it a shot. Btw we left a tip, not needed, but loved the very friendly and respectful kids (staff). Suggest you show them some love too."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place earlier! Upon entering my wife and I wasn't sure if we seat ourselves or if a hostess seats us. First timers here! After asking a staff member, we sat at the bar. The bar wasn't very clean. As I read in other reviews, apparently everyone else noticed the tables weren't very clean.   I was trying to see the menu from the bar, but thankfully a staff member came up behind me and handed us a menu. I decided on the Santa Fe Lite Burrito and a Modelo. I guess we couldn't order from the bar so I got up to order at the register. Which was just a few feet away.   As I seated back down, another staff member brought over a basket of chips. Then, a few moments later I received my food. The food is delicious.   I took off a star, because A) it's confusing for a first timer if it's a restaurant or do I sit anywhere and someone comes up or do I go straight to the register, B) the cleanliness of the bar area wasn't great, C) the staff member bringing me the chips wasn't very nice almost seemed I burdened her for some napkins.   All in all, to me it was just a little more upscale Baja Fresh that served alcohol. The food was great, but maybe train the staff to clean up when there's downtime / be more attentive to first timers."}
{"text":"Only been here once so need to try more items before putting it in the rotation.  Food was good and I like that they have healthy options and a variety of items besides the usual Mexican/American items which we are all tired of seeing on the menu.  I like the décor and staff if very helpful and friendly.  My only concerns are that the food seemed too salty and the prices were high for stand in line to order Mexican food.  Also, 2 of my 3 items were warm (just above room temp) not hot, which was fine for the hot summer and may have been the intent for that dish.  I will try it again and so should you."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!!!! Best kept secret in Summerlin.  Excellent food and so fresh. Great prices and the staff is always happy to see you!!!"}
{"text":"If your from Los Angeles you already know about Sharky's!! This place has amazing fresh, healthy Mexican food! Several different salsas to choose from which is great! From Mexican pizza, to tacos and burritos you have a variety of healthy food choices! The staff are great, very knowledgeable of the menu! This place got me through college in LA so I'm happy to see them expanding into Las Vegas! There will be a total of 14 places in Las Vegas once they are complete with their expansion into this market! A great choice of good food! Welcome to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"We had been looking for good tacos in Las Vegas and I came across Sharkeys on Yelp. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had organic and healthy options. Today we came to Sharkeys for lunch. The atmosphere was bright, modern and welcoming. The customer service was wonderful as we explained we were new customers and they were very helpful. I ended up choosing the tempura batter mahi mahi tacos with black beans and Mexican rice and my husband got the chicken fajita tacos. Both portions were a great value. Everything was fresh and delicious! They brought us warm chips to our table and there was a choice of different salsa at the salsa bar.  Sharkey's is very healthy and delicious and we decided we have found our new place when we want Mexican food! We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The quality and flavors are by far superb to any \"fast food\" Mexican place in the area. not really sure if it is even considered fast food. Regardless it's food is of the highest quality and flavors.    I was extremely happy to see that it moved into my neighbor this year. I used to frequent the one near my home in Orange County California  and I have become a frequent visitor to this one also.   the decor is supercool but not too cool. I would highly recommend this place to anyone that loves good quality flavorful food. My personal favorite is the chicken nachos."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently dined here and really enjoyed our food. Hopefully there will be a location in my area soon.  Sharky's has some things that make it a little different and a little better than the typical quick service Mexican restaurant. They try to use organic ingredients and locally sourced ingredients. The menu is huge and features a menu with lower calorie lower fat options. The menu has calorie counts for every item to help diners make smart choices.  I had the half order of the Shrimp Power Plate with Yucatan Yams and Mexican Rice. The sides were good, but the shrimp was a little rubbery. I love the idea of the power plate so I'd get this again, but with a different meat. My husband ordered Fajita Chicken Tacos and enjoyed them. The tacos were huge and tacos alone made for a large portion of food. We also shared an order of Chicken Nachos. Even the regular order of nachos was plenty to share. The nachos were my favorite item that we tried. They had lots of yummy toppings and flavor.   We almost missed it, but there is a chips and salsa bar in the back of the restaurant. There is a nice variety of salsa flavors. Drink options are interesting as well. They offer sangrias and beers, but also fun lemonades and teas."}
{"text":"Can't say that it is authentic Mexican, but the food was very good. Before you get to your order, they will serve you flavorful crispy thin chips that are salted just right. And then of course, you have to try their salsas of different flavors and levels of spiciness-two of them we loved so much that we bought a small container to take home.   The entire staff was friendly and very willing to explain their menu...they make their salsa fresh everyday from organic ingredients!"}
{"text":"So as I am about to eat here again for the 5th time, I just realized I never updated my rating!! My rating here is based on the food and service. Although it is a sit down restaurant it not a high end \"fancy pants\" restaurant but just absolutely pure, clean, delicious food. It is a vegan and omni's Mexican food heaven! I don't wanna take up a whole page here; just try it!! You won't be sorry. I just can't wait for them to open their location at Craig/95."}
{"text":"Great place great feel like your in California great salsa bar"}
{"text":"Fresh delicious food and the absolute best service ever! We're always greeted with a warm welcoming smile and our food is prepared to perfection. The staff is well trained and extremely attentive and courteous. Thank you for providing such a pleasant atmosphere as well as superb customer service! We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Menu looked amazing so we gave it a shot. Food was good but of the the four choices nothing was amazing! We will give it another shot and choose other options."}
{"text":"This place is good! I recommend the chicken quesadilla or their chicken 4 cheese pizza. The quesadilla is honestly one of the best I've had,  seriously! I will say the nachos suck, they need more cheese.  They have some really good fusion drinks which are the bomb. The salsa bar ous really really good as well. I'll  continue to come back"}
{"text":"My bae and I recently checked this place out after seeing all the fellow Yelp reviews. The location is a little bit hidden in a strip mall next to Pier one near Whole Foods. The vibe inside is really cool, trendy yet chill. They also have an outdoor patio.  For food we shared some complementary chips and salsa. I loved all the salsa options and that it was help yourself. For an entree I had the Chicken Fajita Bowl and my boo had the Shrimp Tacos Plate with a salad. Both were very good and the portion sizes were huge. It was more than enough for a lunch and dinner. We also tried the watermelon basil lemonade. This was probably one of the best drinks I've ever had, very good!  The only reason I'd give them a 4 rather than 5 were from some of the service kinks they still need to work out. Originally they tried to deliver us the wrong order and they also forgot our drink initially so we had to remind them. Overall I'd come back again though and can't wait to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat. The roasted veggies are to die for! My second visit I ordered the veggie bowl only minus quinoa and beans. The manager comes over to me says to just order the side salad and veggies and it's cheaper and he refunded me the difference. Most places wouldn't do that! Great service! Great atmosphere and great food!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Sharkys after seeing the pictures and a 4 star overall review score!   The staff and ambience was great but the food was not even up to average. I ordered the fiesta chicken burrito bc it seemed like the one that would be packed with the most flavor. My friends got the wet tofu burrito and the power plate.   While waiting for our food, they served us fresh chips and told us they had a salsa bar which we could try as well. Went over to the bar and saw there was a \"killer hot\". With my love for spice and flavor I decided to try that, and it was not spicy, not even medium hot either.   My burrito was very bland as well. Not much seasoning or spices, I threw away my meal unfortunately. And if you're a foodie like me, you'll know I usually clear off my plate!  I was hoping for a much better, flavorful experience!"}
{"text":"Came in for a burrito, heard amazing things about the nachos (will be back), and definitely try one of their drinks - like other Yelpers, I would recommend the watermelon basil lemonade.  Walking in, the atmosphere is very casual and modern. The staff greeted us and were very helpful and friendly with questions. They kind of hit you over the head with how they are organic, locally sourced, non-GMO, hormone- and preservative-free as it is posted everywhere. But I'm a huge supporter of supporting locally sourced food, so this was appreciated.  First time here, so had to try the Fiesta Burrito with chicken and wheat tortilla. Words escape me as to how tasty this burrito was. It arrived smoking hot, cut in half, with some chips on the side. The best part? The burrito was \"wet\" inside but not dripping - which is how I think all burritos should be. Every ingredient that went into it was a star. There wasn't too much or little of anything and the taste of each ingredient shined through and complimented each other very well.  The salsa bar was lit. The salsa bar had about 5-6 options. I got the hot avocado salsa (FAVE) and killer hot red sauce. Each on their own was good, but I'm a huge fan of mixing my green and red sauces which makes magic happen in your mouth. They even dropped off some fresh tortilla chips for the table while we were waiting for our burritos. You knew they were fresh because they were still hot when they arrived.  Their high standards for food quality really shows through their product. Would definitely recommend to everyone and will be back again soon for those nachos!"}
{"text":"Just having moved to this side of town 6 months ago, my family was thrilled to have a fast, casual Mexican-ish restaurant open just around the corner from us. Now it's our go-to. We always split the large chicken nachos. Whether it is me with my boyfriend or me with the two kiddos. It's a lot of food. Their salsas are delicious and service is always excellent. To top it off, on the night before thanksgiving they closed a little early and just minutes after my boyfriend and I walked up to the door and knocked. The manager opened it and we apologized and asked if we could buy a couple containers of salsa for the holiday. She said sure and came back with two pint size containers and sent us on our way with a cheerful \"happy thanksgiving,\" no payment necessary. We will be back many more times."}
{"text":"Probably the best fast food/dine in Mexican restaurant in Vegas. The customer service is way above par. I've been here 3 times this week and they went above and beyond assisting me with special requests. The fajita chicken tacos and side salad are the best combo I've had and I eat Mexican food pretty much twice a day!"}
{"text":"5 Stars on Yelp??? Something is wrong!!!!  Awful food,steak was on grade less then Taco-bell (see photos) so chew and dry something crazy! The Mexican rice was so dry and tasted very old, we order a guacamole that came inside a cheap plastic container see my photos(we dine in not a take out), the \"grilled\" veggies were completely burn and tasted like that also they were very cold. The chips and salsa tasted like they were purchased from a 99c store. Very disappointed and can't really understand how they have 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with Sharky's! From the moment you walk in, the decor is charming and pretty. It's really well put together and the staff is so helpful! For the food.. we pretty much ordered everything under the sun and it was ALL AMAZING. Did you know they use local, organic greens? It makes a difference. A few of my favorites were the steak fajita tacos, the BBQ chicken pizza (on a tortilla so it's thin and crunchy!) and the tostada salad with steak. I also really liked their lemonade Fresca and their salsa bar  I will be back and I'm excited!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Mexican food!  Exceeded all of our expectations.  Service is wonderful as well.  Can't wait until they open the Blue Diamond/Decatur location!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at Sharkey's three times now--love it!  Quick order at the counter, lots of organic and healthful choices, free salsa bar and complimentary chips, friendly staff, nice atmosphere inside plus outdoor eating as well. My favorite is the half shrimp power plate with two sides of grilled veggies--no idea how I could eat the full sized one!  The fajita tacos my grandson had looked great!"}
{"text":"The only redeeming thing about today's lunch was free chips and salsa. The process for ordering and getting your food was confusing (go to the \"online order pickup line??\"). Rice and beans had zero flavor (no amount of cholula could save those beans), grilled veggies were raw and barely warmed through, tacos underfilled. Highly disappointed we spent $30 bucks for bland mexican. Even the \"killer hot\" salsa failed to deliver..barely a tingle. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great customer service and food. Plenty of tables and chairs. Food was delicious. Highly recommend this place. A+"}
{"text":"This place is Chipotle meets Rubios, but ideally fresher food and a more personal touch. The salsas are great. The salsa bar was my favorite part - love the fresh pico.   I ordered a chicken fajita bowl; however, the chicken wasn't exactly the fajita-style, longer pieces that you might expect. There wasn't a lot of chicken, and the pieces were small. The bowl had some decent flavor. I bought an extra bowl to take home to a friend, and she also found it lacking enough chicken. The nachos were ok, although they could use some more cheese and chicken as well."}
{"text":"I've had Sharky's in california and was so excited when I saw they were in Las Vegas now. The service was excellent and the food was just as great."}
{"text":"My mother, boyfriend and I got to sharky's on a Saturday at around 1:30pm... it was chaos! People standing everywhere, super crowded. Chaotic and confusing. We ordered a salmon power plate with broccoli and quinoa and veggies, chicken fajita bowl and steak nachos. Now it's time to seat down and wait for our food but we couldn't find a clean table! Even though no one was seating in these tables they had mountains of plates everywhere, only one busboy during rush hour?! We patiently waited by one dirty table but after a few minutes without anyone acknowledging us I when up to the cashier to ask for help. She pointed at the busboy and kept on taking orders. We took the one table he was clearing. Nachos were ok, chicken fajita and power plates were a little bland, I guess after so many good reviews I had very high expectations... I may come back and give this place another shot on a weekday."}
{"text":"This place is neatly placed in a nice shopping center next to a pier 1. The place reminds me a bit of chipotle with the decor. My boyfriend got the the tempura fish tacos which he enjoyed, his cousin got a shrimp burrito and I got a chicken burrito, the one with what seemed like everything: guac, rice, pinto beans, tomatoes. I thought it was good, but too much rice. We all shared chicken nachos, $10, pretty huge we probably could have done with just that. They put jalapeños on it, yummy. Now their sauces... I love spicy, the hottest sauce provided is like ketchup, but smokey. Really can use an upgrade. Not authentic Mexican food, but for American Mexican it's pretty delicious. 3.5 overall but service was really good."}
{"text":"Came here because I saw a photo of what looked to be amazing nachos...and I am not disappointed! I ordered their small size with chicken and it was big enough to share with at least two other people. I liked how they had real chicken pieces that tasted fresh. I also liked the hefty amount of cheese, beans, queso and guac that it had.   I also ordered their taquitos. This is the first time in LV where I have had good taquitos! The order came with three and a good portion of guacamole and pico de gallo.  I visited during happy hour and I liked their offerings. Their nachos with chicken were $8 and the taquitos $5. I also ordered their sangria and I have to admit it was pretty good! This was also $5.   The restaurant does have a healthy vibe to it. You will see a lot of organic options and healthy dishes with the calorie count. They also have a salsa bar that has some pretty good options."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time when i lived in California and im so happy its here in Vegas. I had a bbq chicken pizza which was so good. Crispy and lots of chicken. Its tased so fresh and love the salsa bar. Staff was super friendly. I love that i have a new spot to get sime great food!"}
{"text":"This is place to eat if you like your food to taste fresh. We had a big group, which is hard to please everyone.  No one had a negative thing to see about the food or the service. All great. The manager, staff care about your eating pleasure. We need to see the cute picture that was drawn for you  by Winston."}
{"text":"Im not as optimistic about the debut of Sharkys as the others.  We went for lunch and the place was so devoid of customers that we didnt originally think it was open yet.  After fumbling thru the order taking process I received the wrong drink and my lunch buddies order was incorrect and it had to be sent back twice for them to get it right.  After all of that both of our burritos were surprisingly light on meat...really light.  Now that we had our food we had no utensils so I had to go back inside to find them...once I got back to the table, then someone brought utensils out to us. At the end of lunch we found ourselves thinking it was just OK at best and for the $16+ it cost I would rather go to El Madador or better yet Los Tacos!"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to try Sharky's before they opened, and I am impressed! I had the California Tacos (2 taco plate) and my boyfriend had the half-size Sharky's Chicken Salad. The tacos were perfect, and the side salad was really yummy. I loved the dressing they used. The chicken salad looked beautiful; so colorful!  I tried the house-made sangria (I love sangria), and it tasted so fresh! Sharky's also offers fresh juices, so we tried the watermelon basil and the hibiscus ginger. Delicious.  The atmosphere was perfect, for both casual and intimate dining. The lights are dim, but not so much that you can't see. There are booths, tables, and high tables. The ceiling is industrial-like (but the pretty kind), and the walls are wood. There's a huge window in the front which lets in great natural light (but not the glaring sun). There is an outdoor patio that's very nice as well!  I recommend signing up for the Fin-Addict rewards program (earn points for pre-tax food and drink)!  All in all, I highly recommend Sharky's in Summerlin!"}
{"text":"Sharky's is a new Woodfired Mexican Grill that opened up a few months ago in west Las Vegas. This place is great for good clean food. They use all fresh ingredients including organic local greens, wild caught fish, all natural beef and chicken with no antibiotics or hormones. Non GMO corn and oil. Organic beans, rice, quinoa and tofu. Everything is good you really can taste the difference. The only problem is I don't think a lot of people know about this place. Most of the people I talk to have never heard of them and don't know that they are there. Hopefully the word gets out and they get busier soon. It would be a shame if they closed down due to lack of customers. Maybe a few months of heavy radio advertising would help spread the word. Anyway the food is good and healthy, you guys should try it!  Adios"}
{"text":"This place is great! The service was great and fast. You order first and they hand you a number before your seated. I'm not sure if they usually give tortilla chips while you wait, but they gave us some after we sat down. Our food was really good. The staff was very pleasant."}
{"text":"The best shrimp tacos were amazing!  Hands down, the best thing I ate while in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We received a coupon & decided to give this place a try for our date night dinner! The line was a little crazy, but that's because the employees spend time talking to you, not just order-taking robots. It was packed which is great to see for a healthy restaurant. We didn't get offered a punch/reward card, but that might be because we came in on an ad.   The menu is a lot, but we stuck to familiar fare. I ordered the chicken fajita bowl & hubby ordered a steak burrito. The steak is an upcharge, but no big. The salsa bar is awesome and has a nice variety, but only pico as a mild option. That's ok tho because their pico is DELISH! They brought us some complimentary chips and I fell in love with the freshness of both the chips and the pico. Our plates came out fairly quickly and they both looked great. The meat is a little skimpy. I had a crazy veggie to meat ratio with a lot more beans and rice than meat. Hubby was a little disappointed that his burrito was mostly rice and very little steak for the extra price, but he ate most of the meat and left the filler. Overall it's not bad for the price and the food is tasty but next time I guess he'll have to order double meat :)"}
{"text":"Chicken was VERY DRY. barely edible. Nothing else was very good either. The best thing about the place is the smell of the wood fired grill. This place taught me never to go to a place that advertises itself as healthy. Very disappointed. Also we had to wait way to long. The place was empty."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place after having it bookmarked for a while, especially seeing that they're vegan friendly!   We came in an hour before closing and pretty much had the entire restaurant to ourselves. The downside of coming close to closing was not getting a chance to try their red sangria (they said they just prepared a brand new batch for tomorrow and it takes about 12 hours to \"marinate\" in the fruits) - bummer! Thankfully they had a little bit of the white sangria left which was pretty good; our bf's ended up getting some beers on tap and they enjoyed theirs as well.   Service was alright. Our friends got their food right away but for some reason it took so long for mine and my bf's food to come out - almost 15-20 minutes and like I said, we were literally the only ones in the entire restaurant.   Now about the food: Roasted Veggie Vegan Bowl - 5/5 this was my favorite dish! We added tofu to the bowl which we first thought looked like salmon - it was grilled to perfection and added such a great smoked flavor! Definitely recommend this.  Veggie and Tofu Burrito - 3/5 this was average for me. I needed to add salsa and the avocado cream to make the burrito enjoyable because it was kind of dry without it.   Steak Burrito - 4/5 my friends really liked how juicy and tender the steak was! One comment they made was how it came out kinda cold but other than that, they enjoyed their burritos.  It has a nice ambiance for a casual date or just dinner with family or friends. They have a mini bar and a salsa station.   Overall, we had a pretty good experience! Definitely would love to come back for the roasted veggie bowl."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and unique healthy tasty options. Do you want salad, a bowl, Woodfired Mexican pizza? Welcome to the place to have a great meal!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken tacos and a wet steak fiesta burrito.  Tacos were good.  Burrito was barely warm....cheese on top wasn't melted.  Sent it back.  It was remade.  Plate was hot but again ingredients inside the burrito were barely warm.  The \"ranchero\" sauce on it tasted like watered down tomato sauce.  I don't think there was anything in the burrito that had any seasoning in it.    Two stars for the tacos. The service was great, but $15 for the burrito was a waste.  May try it again.  The nachos did look good."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! The service was great and fast. You order first and they hand you a number before your seated. I'm not sure if they usually give tortilla chips while you wait, but they gave us some after we sat down. Our food was really good. What got us to come here was the picture of their nachos grande posted here on Yelp. It was really good! Their ingredients are simple and don't make you feel guilty for being full."}
{"text":"FIRST OFF LETS JUST SAY--THEY HAVE THE GOOD ICE! most of you know what I mean--the pellet rock looking delicious ice!    I was slightly worried when the nachos were nearly $18 but I was already in the restaurant and starving. My daughter ordered a burrito and said she'd like to taste a few bites of nachos when they came. Her food came out first and I was slightly irritated the food didn't come out together-10 minutes later this huge thing arrived--holy cow!   I had no idea it would be this massive. I wish she would have said something when I ordered, no wonder they were pricey. But I guess if this is the only size of nachos-I would have ordered it anyway.   It was pretty good...not my favorite platter of nachos--but they were good. They have a salsa bar with various salsas which is a nice touch. I plove that all the food is organic and stuff-really speaks to my crunchy granola side. My daughter liked her burrito.  We were stuffed-didn't look like we ate much, but we did. If you have a massive group of kids that want nachos--head over this way. Friendly staff. Tasty food"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Today was our cheat day. We enjoyed everything. I ordered angus steak with 3 sides. I asked the cashier if they can make my steak cooked medium rare / medium but unfornately they cant. It turned out welldone i really done like my meat welldone especially if its non gmos or chemical free steak. Since it was a little burnt i wanted A1 sauce and they didnt have it too hehe. but i guess its okay because I was very hungry. i love their killer spicy salsa and so the medium salsa.  My boyfriend enjoyed his food as well because it doesnt have rice in it. organic  quinoa delicious too but the organic yucatan yum was bomb.com so good yummy!! We will definitely come back here 5/9/2018"}
{"text":"I can best describe my experience as a hot mess, redeemed by solid food.  Got there about 8pm (maybe part of the issue?)  Let me break it down for you...  Ordering:  pretty seamless experience.  wasn't busy, ordered my goods.  Order taker was pretty pleasant. Thought my order was a no brainer (fish tacos, guac, soda).  This is one of those places where you get a number and they bring it to your table.  Tables/cleanliness:  not so hot.  maybe because it was close to end of night, but looked a bit messy from earlier diners.  Service:  disappointing.  Fish tacos arrived reasonably fast.  Asked server about guac.  said she would check, she didn't.  had to go track down the main food runner/manager/busser??  to finally get it.  No silverware, another trip to find that.  Seemed non-plussed and unapologetic.  Food:  Fish tacos very good, gauc was ho hum.  salsa bar was a bit unkempt and thin on a couple of the options.  I would give it another shot if I happened to be in town again."}
{"text":"This place was so good! I didn't come in before, so I decided to try it. They have organic natural ingredients and you can really tell the difference in the taste. They also offer whole wheat tortillas too. My son got the Kids bean and cheese and I got the fiesta burrito. Both of our burritos were amazing. They chips are also really good. They have a hint of lime, which is different than your basic salt and chip flavor. I really enjoyed the chips. They also have a salsa bar. The salsas were ok, but my favorite were the avocado based and the spicy red sauce. I'm glad I stopped by, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. I ordered the protein plate with half wild caught salmon, brown rice, grilled veggies and chips and guacamole. The plate was small for the price. I expected a much larger portion for $10+. The salmon was decent but the grilled veggies and rice were tastiest parts of the dish. I was disappointed that the salmon was forgettable. The chips and guacamole were a good value at $4 with a good amount of guacamole. However, the guacamole was muted in its flavor. My husband had a wet chicken burrito. The burrito was huge! It took up the entire plate. He says that the burrito was a great choice and that the chicken was well seasoned and moist. Overall enjoyed the burrito and stated that all the elements worked harmoniously as an entree. All in all the experience was mediocre; not bad, not fantastic, just average. I'd probably go back and try something new if I was invited by a friend."}
{"text":"Organic + Mexican food = a very happy me!!  I am absolutely in love with this place and probably eat here 4-6 times a week.  Tortilla chips with a lime flavor and the perfect amount of salt are my weakness, then you add the delicious homemade salsa and you have perfection!  The salsa bar is my happy place!  The watermelon basil lemonade is the only thing I drink here and I happily eat the half power plate with chicken or beef (the beef is so juicy and amazing) with a side of Mexican rice and yams.  It's the perfect size meal!  This review has made me hungry - time to head back to Sharky's!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant. I love the recessed ceiling and art. There is a variety of seating, booths, tables & chairs. I am all about healthy and plant based and they have a variety of yummy foods that allows for all pallets. They have a cute little 2 seat bar and yes they serve alcohol. I have nothing negative to say about this establishment. I will definitely return and recommend."}
{"text":"this place has wonderful food and great customer service!! my only complaint is that whenever we order take out they don't get our order exactly right, but other than that the food is always fantastic!!"}
{"text":"The food was good.. I liked that it was trying to be mostly organic and sustainable.. The quality of meat was great! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 Stars is because it was quick service. That really caught me off guard as I wasn't expecting it. I'm personally not a fan of that set up. I had intentions of getting a cocktail when I originally went but didn't get the chance to being as you're in the ordering spot right when you walk in. Although the staff was all very friendly not to sure if I'll be back. It could maybe be somewhere I'd take my daughter in a pinch."}
{"text":"My veggie bowl was most delicious and LOTS of it, and my husband's salmon & veggies also very good - as was the chips & dip and beer - from local brewery... We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to hear Sharkey's came to LV as I grew up in SoCal where I first had sharkeys. I love the fact that everything is organic, fresh, and on the healthier side than most typical Mexican restaurants. I came on a Friday night and it was packed- good sign I told myself! The cashier was super friendly and courteous, as was the staff. Everyone was warm and attentive being how busy they were.... I ordered the taco plate and was a little disappointed as it lacked a little flavor. I'm not sure if maybe it was an off night but it certainly was missing some taste. I'll give it another try and I'm hoping it will be better :)."}
