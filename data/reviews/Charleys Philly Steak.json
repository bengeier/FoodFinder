{"text":"Sandwiches and fries are good and not too highly priced for a mall food court. I've been here twice and have been satisfied both trips."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it less than one start although I like their sandwiches, the staff including the manager were just rude and unprofessional. So much so I don't think I'll be back to this location for food. There are others in Charlotte so I choose one of the other options next time. Every review about this location on Google says the same thing about the staff being rude. If I find the time I'm going to look into contacting the general manager or owner, they need to know that the staff are bringing this place down!"}
{"text":"Can the owners of the mall please shut his ghetto ass place you call a family restaurant down it's not doing anything but causing a bad experience at the food court in Northlake mall. My fianc√© and I went to get a sandwich yesterday (12/20/17) around 6:52pm and after I received my food I proceeded to ask the only girl behind the counter if I can have some water and a to-go bag for my order and she pointed in the direction it was . Then she yelled out \" DAT GURL WAY TOO PURTY TO BE!!..ETC\" im not sure what else she said bc the other employee was to busy telling me \"Don't worry about her and her dusty weave\" anyways I didn't understood the rest of what she was saying anyways. Finally I get home my stomach is growling and I'm ready to eat before I pop the sandwich into the oven there was 3 hairs wrapped in my cheese .. disgusting! Filthy ghetto ass place. I called the restaurant to complain and no answer. I will be calling corporate today."}
{"text":"Started to order but no one would acknowledge that I was even there. Walked a few steps and ordered from Showmars insted."}
{"text":"I really like Charley's and I've been to a few, but this one right here ... not the best spot. The dude making the sandwiches looked like he hadn't changed his gloves since he started his shift!! His fingers had poked holes through and he just kept making sandwiches like it was all good.   Yea, I'm good on this Charley's. They're only open because it's in the mall. If it wasn't, it'd be curtains for them!!!"}
{"text":"Not a very good place , lack of communication with service provider. Had to relay my family's order three times.  Service there is well under par.  Pass this place up if you have thoughts"}
