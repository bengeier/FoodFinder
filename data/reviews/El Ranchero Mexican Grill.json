{"text":"About a mile west from the DMV on Flamingo Rd. Best tacos ever. Fresh food was cooked on order. I ate here and got my car washed next door instead of waiting at the DMV for my number to be called."}
{"text":"Really great food and have loved eating there, but their hours are inconsistent.  I called to place a to-go order 15 minutes before close and was told they were already closed due to cleaning.  I will come back because I like the food, but it's quite frustrating how limited their hours are and that you can't expect them to be open when they say they are."}
{"text":"I just moved near this restaurant and thought I would give it a try on my way to work.  I picked up a breakfast burrito and it was pretty good and very filling.  You can order it anyway you want, and they seem happy to accommodate.  The owner was friendly and welcoming, and I felt that the quantity was good for the price.  It is a little hole in the wall place in a strip mall, and very plain inside, but I will definitely give it another try.

My only real complaint is that they are only open from 7am to 2pm, making it hard to get to them while they are open, as I don't work nearby and they are closed before I get home.  Oh, and I went there at about 7:45am, and they still had not made the horchata, which was disappointing, but somehow I survived.  This is definitely a mom and pop operation, and they are closed on Sunday too.  So for me, I will more than likely only be able to go there on Saturdays, or before work in the morning once in a while, which will make it difficult to make it one of my go-to Mexican food places.  However, I do recommend you give them a try, and I hope they are successful, as they seem like very nice people."}
{"text":"I only give one star if they hurt me. This was the worst experience I've paid for since my last airplane flight, and my worst time at a restaurant in recent memory.

The prices are average for this sort of place. The food is not bad. It tends to the watery side of things. We tried a beef dish and juevos rancheros. The eggs were runny in limpid gravy, and the beef wasn't bad but had some gristle. Their homemade hot sauce is very good. The source of pain was not the food but the atmosphere. The young daughter of the guy behind the counter shrieked almost constantly the entire time we were there--a little over ten minutes waiting to get our food, and then the ten minutes it took us to wolf it down so we could escape. An acquaintance of the guy had a young boy, who also shrieked. Five people sat around a table without food and talked about upselling.

I left with a headache from the shrieking and a bellyache from eating too quickly. Maybe I'll try takeout sometime--but I'll give the other Mexican places around here a shot first.

To be fair, this place would be awesome if you have horrible children."}
{"text":"The machaca burrito is my favorite!  It is so good and filling. Thanks Guys for making great food in our community!!  My grandsons like the beAn and cheese burritos."}
{"text":"Good lunch place.  Everything I have had is better than average.  Prices are average.  Sometimes to service is slower than I would like.  All in all a good value with good food."}
{"text":"Carne asada burrito is DELICIOUS.  Non descript location in a strip mall of the 10 on chandler blvd.  Staff is really friendly."}
{"text":"My son and I were in search of a quick Mexican lunch and El Ranchero was recommended by a friend. This little store front is nothing fancy, but it was clean, the service was pleasant and the food was delicious. I had a shrimp taco and a fish taco. My son had enchiladas and a chicken taco. We asked that they hold the onions and they did. This allowed us to taste the food and not just onions as so often happens when cooking with onions.

I'm looking forward to introducing the rest of the family to El Ranchero!"}
{"text":"Average Mexican food prices ...Carne asada  is perfectly  seasoned ...beans taste like home made...rice needs some work but still tastes  good ...would definitely  recommend"}
{"text":"We found this place down the street from our hotel. Ordered the carne asada plate x4. The service wss a bit slow which was probably due to frequent clients coming in to order.  The guy at the counter was very friendly and kept everyone's attention with his conversation.  The food was actually very good. The carne asada was moist and flavorful. The Mexican rice was perfect as well as the refried beans.  The next time we visit Phoenix,  we'll definitely stop by again. Gracias se√±or counter guy from Ecuador."}
{"text":"Once again my gf and I continue to eat here and always the food is great especially considering its affordable and fresh. Great place for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try a new mexican food place close by, so i tried El Ranchero today. It was a fail. The horchata was gross, the beans were soupy, the rice very bland and boring. Not authentic.  I'll pass on this place. :)

Edit: food = barf, because that's what it made me literally do. :'("}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Fresh, great flavor. My husband and I both had a breakfast burrito with green chili, potatoes, egg and bacon. They even gave  us extra bacon. They were huge and I had no problem eating the whole thing. 

Great customer service, so friendly!"}
{"text":"Breakfast are very generous, delicious, made to order. This is definitely not your MCDonalds type of breakfast. I have been coming for the last 3 years and will continue coming."}
{"text":"I've tried several gringo favorites here, and this food tastes like home-made.  They also have non-gringo food like tongue and head meat.    Many of the recipes are from the owner's family.

Price:  Average for the volume of food ($6-10/lunch)
Service:  The order takers have always been pleasant, and so has the people who deliver the order to your table.
Taste:  Everything I've tried has been AWESOME, and their red sauce is great on everything.

It seems strange that it would be buried in a strip mall, but the food is definitely worth your time.

The Al Pastor meat is awesome!"}
{"text":"My dad and I wanted some decent, non-chain Mexican food in ahwatukee. You'd think that would be an easy feat in ahwatukee. Not so much. Lots of chains but they're not very authentic. A quick Yelp search sent us to El Ranchero. We were NOT disappointed. Cheap, delicious and fresh. A carne asada burrito was FULL of tender beef. Awesome retried beans and the best carnitas I've had in Arizona. The service was fast and friendly. Swing in!!!"}
{"text":"Great carne asada burritos.  The fish taco/burritos are also on point.  The owner is incredibly friendly and gives personal service.  The food is affordable and extremely high quality.  I enjoy coming here for consistent good tasting Mexican, best in the area.  Skip 'bertos and come here instead for an authentic taste."}
{"text":"This is one of my very favorite places in the valley. Their food is fantastic! No one in my family has had a bad meal in the place and neither have the friends I've brought.

Now, I could list all the different things I've tried but that would take a while and, well, what would be the point? Between us, we've tried just about everything. The shrimp dishes are yummy because they cook the shrimp just right, it's not overdone like so many places in the desert. The chicken is delicious and the beef and pork are really good, too. Oh, and my daughter loves the tamales. My favorite thing is the chicken chimichanga. 

While the place isn't five stars on the atmosphere, nobody goes there for that. They go for amazing food at bargain prices. It's just a pleasure to support a local guy starting a family, eat the great food and walk out with your wallet intact."}
{"text":"Pulled into a gas station to put some gas in my car when I noticed this taco place adjunct to the Sinclair store. I was kinda hungry so I decided to fill up my own tank with tacos. The place looks kinda new so it was very clean and the people working there were very attentive. 
I ordered some carne asada tacos and a shrimp cocktail for dessert. 
The tacos. Tacos were pretty good they had plenty of meat although they were a little too greasy for me when trying to maintain my six pack not looking like a keg (half ways there)
So next time I'll just ask them to use less oil a that should bring the tacos to perfect.
The shrimp. This is one dish I would consider myself an expert, I eat more than my share of shrimp and I have the cholesterol to prove it! Best deal in the house for the price. They were fresh and juice was flavorful and had the right amount of spiciness. It may be a little to spicy for some green..folks that..go there, but you can always ask for your level of spice.
 I also got a can soda, I have nothing against can sodas as a matter of fact I collect the cans ( they turn into tacos) but I prefer the fountain sodas, I always like to refill my cup as I leave a fast food establishment, there's nothing better than the feeling of getting something for free.
 So here's my free gift to you... Do yourself a favor and try this new place, the food is great, prices are good and you'll be supporting a local business...your tank and the economy will thank you."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in a strip mall but worth the visit.  Simple and great tasting mexican fare with good service.  It is one of those hole in the wall places you discover and keep  going back because they have good food.

El Ranchero is worth visiting if you want to try some good mexican food at a good price."}
{"text":"Deliciousness.  Stopped by on the way to the ice den and very happy we did.  Super nachos with asada,  super Carne asada burrito and a cheese quesadilla and all were super good. Red salsa was very good. Service was very friendly and a pleasant atmosphere. The burrito and super nachos was very good and would come back for more."}
{"text":"Why would you go to a strip mall for Mexican food when there are 2 large chain restaurants right across the parking lot? Because the food is GREAT, that's why! Is it a simple place? Sure. Maybe 40 dishes on the menu. But the food is fresh, it is tasty (my wife is practically drinking the green chile sauce from my plate), and the people who run it are nice. What more could you want from a lunch place? :)"}
{"text":"Good fast food mexican place close to the office. Attached to a Sinclair gas station so filler up, car wash and mexican dinner! 3 for 1 as I call it!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. They have awesome tortas. The service is great and always friendly. Pricing is good for the amount of food you get. Definitely worth stopping by if you're hungry and in the area."}
{"text":"The location in a convenient shopping center just off Chandler Blvd, but it was well lit and clean. The cashier, who I think may have been the owner, was happy to serve us and answer our questions.  My husband got a super burrito, my sister a taco combination plate of carne asada, and I got a carnitas torta. There meals were lacking a bit in in flavor. The lengua needed salt badly. But my torta,(hot sandwich), was yummy. Ashamed to say, I actually ate the whole thing. All and all, I recommend at least trying  El Ranchero."}
{"text":"There are few places that make a great burrito. This place is one of them. It is clear that there is pride in ownership. The food is always fresh. I will be a regular

Update 6/6/15 - As promised after my initial 5 star review of this place I became a regular. I am disappointed to have to reduce them to 2 stars. The quality has dropped off considerably since my first few visits, The last 2 visits resulted in a much different experience. The 'grilled chicken' has been off along with the shredded beef. Nothing like the first few visits. I may try again, but for now I am going to pass."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, food is great, feels authentic, and be sure to try the shrimp cocktail."}
{"text":"I arrived during lunch time  (1pm) and they were busy so it took a while to get my food. However it was definitely worth the wait. I ordered their mini Carne asada tacos. The meat was seasoned well and there was a ton of it. I loved it. My brother ordered the Carne asada super burrito. He said it was good but he still prefers someburros. I will definitely be back for the tacos."}
{"text":"El Ranchero is located in a strip mall facing Chandler Blvd.  Not very impressive but don't let that fool you.  It is a tiny place but clean and the staff was very friendly and attentive.  I had the Pastor Burrito and it was excellent.  If you are looking for a quick, reasonable Mexican food lunch this place is great."}
{"text":"So yummy! Great prices and so friendly!! It is buried in a strip mall but is sooo worth your time! The food is great, a lot to chose from and great orchata!! I love coming here for lunch on my work break and now that I love further away I still make the trip. It's sooo worth it!"}
{"text":"I ate here when visiting with my son for a hockey tournament.   The carnitas and pastor was delicious.  The red salsa was hot and flavorful.  Service was friendly. 

My only complaint was they were closed when we went back for dinner on a Saturday night.  They were also closed on Sunday."}
{"text":"Gone are the days when this restaurant was excellent. The place has raised their prices steadily for the past 3 years, and the food quality has diminished after a few ownership changes.

The place is Ok, the food is average. With many other options nearby, I can only give it 3 out of 5 stars (and this is in large part due to what the restaurant once was)."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a couple times now, breakfast and lunch. They serve great eats with a friendly attitude and it's at a great price! 
Would love for them to get a fountain drink machine as opposed to cans/bottles in the fridge but other than that, it's been a big hit in my book!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for lunch a few times each month ever since they opened.  These guys work hard, make a good super burrito, keep the place clean, keep the prices reasonable and have good hot sauce.  The meat used is 'clean' (gristle/fat/etc free), unlike the 'F-bertos' chains and other mom-n-pop Mexican restaurants around town (one of my biggest complaints at other Mexican eateries).  I've never come away ill after eating here either, something I also can't say of other similar places."}
{"text":"This is where I stop before work when I'm hungover because their Arizona burrito with carne asada and potatoes comforts like no other.   Some places are hit or miss with under-cooked breakfast potatoes but El Ranchero always nails it.  Coconut water, ibuprofen and these Arizona burritos are my hangover cures."}
{"text":"Came here during my lunch break! The owner (Elias I think) took my order with a smile and a couple of jokes. Really friendly guy who clearly enjoys what he does. He gave me a few recommendations on what to order. I ended up getting the chicken enchiladas, which were very tasty. The plate came with rice and beans on the side. I also ordered a small horchata which was really refreshing on a hot afternoon. My coworker had the bean and cheese burrito - simple but delicious. 

Behind the cash register is part of the kitchen. You can watch the \"assembly line\" and see your food getting prepared right in front of you. 

The restaurant isn't fancy but the food is great quality, authentic Mexican food. It was clean and felt welcoming. I will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Worst burrito I've ever got. Skimp you on the meat, for a $6.46 burrito you would think they would give you a little more.  I should of just went down the street to Filibertos, but I thought I'll give them a try after the reviews...

On that note work on your customer service skills as well. If you don't want to get ripped off, do yourself a favor and don't go there."}
{"text":"So I stopped here on a whim because I had a craving for some Mexican food and the Federicos I tried to go to is permanently closed. I am not in the least bit disappointed and it was probably a blessing in disguise. I only had the rolled tacos combo. You tell a lot about a place by the simple stuff and these definitely some of the best I've had. 

The salsa deserves it's own paragraph because of it's quality. I unwittingly globbed a bunch on my rolled taco expecting it to be tame to mild... Nope. Its fuego like the bottle says, and it's delicious as hell. After my sinuses cleared and my eyes stopped watering I got a chance to notice the awesome subtle smokey taste. The consistency is good too--not too runny, not too chunky like pico de gallo. Absolutely perfect.

The rolled tacos were nicely prepared. Not over fried with hard, dehydrated bits hanging out. They weren't greasy all and the garnishes including some awesome guacamole were pretty darn fresh. 

The rice was good. Not as savory as some of the other places I've been too but not under flavored either. The refried beans included were pretty awesome too, creamy but firm enough you could actually eat them with a utensil. 

Definitely will be returning! The gentleman that took my order was a hoot too. He explained to me all the options for different dishes and they were more than happy to customize orders to your liking. Maybe I can convince the office to cater from this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in here based on yelp stars, have to admit that it doesn't look like much and we almost didn't go in.  The food was surprisingly fresh, cheap and good."}
{"text":"Best Menudo you can find in AZ!! Pasole is amazing too! I've ordered many different things here and they've never disappointed! All the food is made fresh too! Only Mexican place I recommend!!"}
{"text":"Brought here by friends who knew what they were talking about. Excellent food, super service in s clean place. Gotta love restaurants like this one."}
{"text":"Very good little Authentic Mexican Restaurant, I always get the carne asada quesadilla and its got a very good flavor, plus they also have the coca cola bottle which makes the meal that much better, the service its very quick, good and friendly, 

The rice is best i ever had,"}
{"text":"I have been wanted to check out this spot forever... So this day for lunch I entered the restaurant to a really friendly and helpful staff. I ordered the 3 taco combo It comes with rice and beans. The salsa was pretty good it could have been a bit hotter...I rate the food as followed.

Lenuga (Beef Tongue)  A
Barbacoa (Beef Cheek) B+
Carne Asada B
Beans C+
Rice C+

My lunch crew ordered an Al Pastor torta.. I was able to try this too super great flavor... I gave it an A+ I will be back again just to get that torta again along with great prices a must stop for anyone looking for some great food."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness I am so glad we were able to get here before the closed. The food was simply awesome and so authentic. My boyfriend had the enchiladas and I had the beef taco. The salsa was creamy. Definitely a redo!!"}
{"text":"Chimichanga is the bomb! That and everything else is real good once you eat here you won't want to eat at any other Mexican restaurant ever again"}
{"text":"Possibly the best Mexican Restaurant. Everything I have ever tried was nothing short of amazing, but I usually got the Taco Salad. Who thought salads could be so filling?
Anyway, the food is authentic and they often have bottled Coca-Cola made with cane sugar which is also amazing. The prices are also great and the service is great. I always feel welcome when I'm there.
Definately put this place on your list if you're looking for a new Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food, very affordable. Fast friendly service. Excellent for lunch, and also have kids meals(perfect sized portions for my 6 year old!) I just wish they stayed open later most of the week. They close at 3 nearly every day, but Friday they close at 6."}
{"text":"I ordered the surf n turf plate ( Steak and shrimp fajitas with refried beans,rice and tortillas) , a special not on their regular menu . Owner was super friendly and suggestive . The meal was good , well priced and made to order . If you want a spicy sauce , ask for the \"Fuego\" , a spicy sauce with really good flavor !! Lots of interesting options , their breakfast menu looked great as well . Wish this place served alcohol or atleast beer !!"}
{"text":"The service is super friendly! The general menu items are above average, but the pozole is my favorite. My co-worker orders and loves their nachos. Their service with smiles from the guys helps bring people back."}
{"text":"Huuuge portion!! I went here for lunch and ordered the chimichanga. The portion was huuuuge! I put a dime in the picture for scale! I got it with shredded chicken and I loved it! My experience was good, but the plastic utensils were very small, so it was a bit difficult to eat such a large chimichanga with a tiny fork. Also, the guy who I placed my order with, didn't offer if I wanted to order a drink, and it didn't occur to me to order any, so I just wish he kind of upselled more. I would definitely recommend the restaurant! And don't forget to order a drink!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on Thursday lunchtime, just a fast break for just three tacos al pastor in mini size.  They were okay but I felt they were bordering on too dry.  Pastor is supposed to be slightly dry but these were more dry than I felt could be better.  They were seasoned on the spicy side.  The salsas were spicy and standard.  The place seemed clean and I may go back for Saturday special half a grilled chicken and Peruvian sides for $15 or to try out more options. The only thing that kind of grossed me out was no hand soap in the restroom.  I am hoping it had just ran out because everything else was really clean in the place.  I do not suspect cleanliness to be a problem.  At least I hope not.  I hope to edit this review after I've tried more food items on a future visit."}
{"text":"Decent tacos. The flavor is great! Although the tortillas were a little dry, and the meat a little tough (had the carne). The staff were exceptionally friendly and the owner is a passionate food lover. I must say I expected a little more after reading the reviews."}
{"text":"I've recently tried the sandwiches (tortas) and they're really good as well, fyi."}
{"text":"Genuine, real-deal. Must return! Menu is fantastic!! Good value.  Congrats!"}
{"text":"Best burritos I've ever had. I work near here and it's hard not to go here every day. 
The people that work here are ALWAYS happy to see you and they give genuine amazing customer service! :)"}
{"text":"Got lunch here, tried the green chili super burro.  Very good, especially with the red and green chili sauce they give to you on the side. Spouse tried the chicken soup,  very good as well.  Soup had veggies and big pieces of chicken.   Will definitely be visiting again soon. Very much a hole-in-the-wall Good Food place."}
{"text":"This was the best Chorizo Egg BurritoI have ever had, yummy!  I usually only eat half of a big burrito, but it was so awesome tasting that I ate the whole thing when I got home.  Now my son will compare Burritos and I am sure it will win #1 with him as well.  Going back every time I babysit in Chandler."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today.  I'm not really impressed and not at all bothered by the food.  I got a plate of steak in sauce with rice, beans and flour tortillas.  The meat was a bit tough, but fairly standard for strip mall mexican food.  I can't really complain.  It tasted good and hit the spot."}
{"text":"Been dying to try this place due to the positive Yelp reviews but have yet to be afforded the chance.  The location is closed on Sundays and is only open during breakfast/lunch hours during the week.  We busted our butts to get there last Saturday to get there before they closed at 2.  We arrived at 1:30 to a locked door and closed shop.  No sign on the door. hours posted matched Yelp.  Really disappointing."}
{"text":"I found out about this place by accident as I stopped to get gas at the next door station and noticed menus for El Ranchero so I took one. I noticed that it is a taco shop located adjacent to the gas station and after browsing the menu I made note to come back.

My sweetheart and I were in the mood for Mexican food one night so we stopped here to give it a try and we also got 10% our tab for checking in on Yelp!

The food was super good, fresh, authentic, generous with great prices!

What we ordered...

shredded beef burrito which was stuffed with tender meat, green peppers and onion!
rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese, hand stuffed and rolled!
carne asada soft street tacos, full and delicious!
California burrito, jam packed good!

The place is clean and the staff is Amazing. You can dine in, take out or use their drive thru window for on the go grub! We decided to dine in on our last visit and it was a nice and comfortable experience.

They boast about being Authentic and they are! I have to say they have the best homemade frijoles (refried beans) I have ever tasted!

We will be back again for sure, and lucky for us they are close to our home!"}
