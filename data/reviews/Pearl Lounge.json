{"text":"I've just moved into the area, and have been looking for a new local bar - and the Pearl Lounge is it!

The owner and staff are very friendly, willing to strike up a conversation or leave you in peace if you like. The beer is always cold, and there is Shisha for those who are so inclined. 

That being said, the food here is spectacular. The burgers in particular are amazing; 6oz patties made fresh and grilled to perfection - each burger is styled after a different area in the Netherlands in honour of the Dutch owner, and they do not disappoint. 

I'm starting to find myself going out of my way to visit for some great conversation and great food - I would highly recommend the Pearl Lounge if you want to enjoy a casual night out."}
{"text":"This is the worst shisha lounge I have ever been too . Over priced for low quality shisha. No food after 12, but they do serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Amazing. Staff and Ownership are fantastic. The best place for food and Sheesha. Warm environment. Very welcoming. What more do you need?  Bring your date..."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! 

The service is amazing. The kids running the place are warm and friendly. They have TV screens everywhere and a large screen with a projector where you can watch games. The shisha is perfect - herbal but tastes great and gives you a nice buzz. The volcano burger is to die for. 

Also everything is very reasonably priced, and they have free Wi-Fi.

Overall this is a great place to kick back on a lazy weekend."}
{"text":"This was a very unpleasant experience for me. I literally just came from this place.. got the worst service ever. Waiter took too long to take our drink n appetizer orders. Had to wait longer to order our main dish. The wings are PINK. The marinade gave the wings a pink colour on the inside.. we didn't even want to finish them. Table was also dirty upon arrival, waiter had the nerve to offer us a seat there. I was turned off & should've turned back. 

The music was good & up to date but poor system."}
{"text":"We came here solely for the sheeshah, therefore the review is for that.
The server said said the regular sheeshahs ($15) are not very good, but the premiums are better, which of course cost more. Why even have something that you consider \"bad\" on the menu??


We requested double apple, we advised by the server that it is very strong and very harsh.
We ordered it anyway. It was very light, no smoke. One of the worse sheeshahs I have tried.
I made the comment to the waiter. His response was \"you haven't tried the other ones\".
I can only imagine how much worse they are.

We ended up getting fried and a burger. Average at best, but we weren't here for the food either.

The service however was nice, the server was very nice.

Overall, if you're looking for good sheeshah, LOOK ELSEWHERE! 
We will not be returning here."}
{"text":"so we came here as spot 3 for a random bar hop with my coworkers and the sole reason we came was to do Hookah - that was an epic fail because 2 of the Hookah's they had were broken (aka Not Available).

There was no explanation as to why this was, and what made it worse was that we were not told until AFTER we ordered a drink.. had we known this was the case we would have just gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"Friday night, outrageously bad service; very loud and repetitive music (same song 3 times in 30 minutes); underwhelming hookah and flat drinks with limited alcohol. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Perfect local spot. Food is good. Shesha is great. Owner very nice. This is my regular."}
{"text":"I think it's a great place to meet up with friends late night if you're in the North York area.  Having Shisha service is definitely attractive for my middle eastern/Asian friends although this will be out due to the ban pretty soon.  The ambience is pleasant with good music and lighting (not too loud or silent).  

The service wasn't as great as expected as it took almost 30 minutes for 1 meal to be delivered on a not so busy night and there were no follow-ups from the waitress the entire night. We had to approach her if we needed something and to make our payment.  Overall a clean and friendly environment."}
{"text":"This place is upstairs so look for that. 
There's nothing fancy of over the top about it. It's just your usual lounge. Nothing extravagant but to be honest, you don't need it either. 

Walk in and seat yourself. Option of table and chairs or sofas. There are Tvs but if you're with company, you won't need them. 

The employee was quite nice and accommodating. We didn't feel pressure to order anything and weren't haggled with constant interruptions. For the most part, we were left alone which was great. 

If you like tea, sorry to disappoint but they only have green or black. We had already ate so we didn't mind. I did try their shrimp salad though. It's was actually quite yummy and not overly salted. Bonus! 

The shisha pull was kind of light to be honest. We got strawberry flavour but it didn't taste like strawberry. It really didn't taste like anything but in a good way. (If that even makes sense) 

But overall experience, can't complain. Most def a place in my neighbourhood I'd hang out often."}
{"text":"If I could give this 0 stars I would. The owner is rude and very very disrespectful. Overpriced. Terrible customer service. Watered down drinks. Terrible shisha. Save yourself the time and money and go somewhere else."}
