{"text":"Nothing to write home about.  Decor is nice.  Music is way too loud to enjoy your meal.  My chicken tasted bland and like cardboard.  Prices are ok.    I honestly don't understand what the hype is about."}
{"text":"Favourite spot for breakfast! Quick and super tasty.  On weekends there will be lineups but it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"For me this is the place to have a nice and quiet breakfast.the staff is great friendly and always happy to serve you."}
{"text":"Went there for a Sunday brunch. Had French toast. Unfortunately they were not for my taste. I'd rather call it a toast with egg smear than a French toast. Honestly not sure why this place is popular? Maybe other dishes are different.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Sunday 11:30 the restaurant was busy. Our server was Sangeetha professional, friendly and attentive. Food was good, vibe of the restaurant was great. There were a few families and lots of young couples.  I was reluctant to try Evviva but glad  I stayed open minded and had a good experience. Some reviews aren't favorablre but going in with no expectations paid off,. I highly recommend this breakfast joint. Just sit back and enjoy."}
{"text":"i went there yesterday (sunday). it was really busy and we have to wait around 10 minutes.i didnt mind waiting because they were busy. the food came on time and everything we asked for was perfect. i'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I were here last Saturday. We waited no more than 15 minutes. We chose to sit on the patio. It was a very humid day to be on patio but our server Sangeetha made up for it with her speedy service and warm smile. My husband ordered the chicken waffle after the recommendation made by our server and I decided to get the breakfast sandwich. Both were definitely a hit in our books. The freshly squeezed o.j. was just perfect for the weather. The service and the food here were both amazing. Will definitely be coming back when we are in town again."}
{"text":"Went last month for breakfast, was in a rush and ended up having to just take it to go as it was extremely busy.. Requested our order be put on rush and the waitress did. Although we didn't stay, she was friendly and attentive. Amazing service for my first time there.  However the chicken I got tasted like actual cardboard. So dry and so tough.   Went back today and got take out, salmon with rice and salad. Amazing.  Will return."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! Went with a group of five for brunch and the meal was delicious. We ordered a couple of breakfast sandwiches, the eggs florentine, french toast and a steak sandwich. The portions sizes were also pretty generous and there are a lot of options on the menu. Our server was great and we'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great panckakes, French toast, sausages ar best quality, they use premium coffee, great staff."}
{"text":"delicious, quick service and delicious food (the homestyle fries and poutine have my heart)"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast in the area. Yes, it does get busy so if you have a choice, come early. We work early so we're normally there right when it opens. Always solid service and good food. We also work in the area so it's very convenient as well."}
{"text":"It is at the corner of a street plaza at Vaughan Mills.  There is a patio.  We order omelettes.  It is ok but not great.  With the presentation, I think Cora is better.  Here you can sit much comfortably than McDonald across the street and with a little bit more price."}
{"text":"Decided to come here on a whim while waiting for my wife to finish some shopping. Ordered the big breakfast with a side of pancakes and a coffee. Waited for 20 mins and watched my brunch go to the guy that sat down next to me 10 mins after I came in and ordered. After I complained twice about my missing breakfast, manager came over and offered a weak apology and said my breakfast went to the next table because we ordered the same thing! That's not my problem! All-in-all, 35 mins before I got my breakfast and when it finally came, pancakes were over-done and made Cora's taste like a Michelin star restaurant in comparison. Waitress needed to be reminded twice to top off my coffee. Not that I was expecting anything, but a complimentary cup of coffee or some discount on my bill would have been the right thing to do. But nothing. I paid full fare, $22.38 for a late, poorly made, breakfast and coffee. Avoid this place if you can, there are so many other options."}
{"text":"I had the bacon and eggs breakfast and my boyfriend had the steak and eggs. The steak was cooked as he had asked. The homefries were crispy and seasoned to perfection. The bacon could have been crispier but all in all it was a pretty good breakfast.   Our waitress was friendly and joked with us throughout the meal. It's a nice restaurant for a traditional breakfast and is not too expensive."}
{"text":"Initially started with a few missteps that wouldn't have warranted a troubled meal - forgot to bring milk for the coffee , smothered the hollandaise sauce over the eggs benny rather than bringing it on the side, as requested. But when they brought it back with the sauce on the side, and gave me literally just a raw egg yolk (no even the white) on the English muffin, I had enough. Egg yolk was so raw that the transparent layer over the yolk hadn't even become translucent yet. Had really hoped for a better experience. Rest of the party enjoyed their meals. Still hope to try there again some time soon as management was apologetic."}
{"text":"Great and quality food Speed service and nice ambiance :) No wait time, has indoor and outdoor areas and nice decoration  And they service fresh orange juice"}
{"text":"The food is good usually they are pretty quick too but even if it gets a little busy it's like they get overwhelmed. we waited 40 minutes to get a table which is fine because it was mothers day but it then 15 minutes just to bring us a menu. We ordered drinks and coffee and food after 15 minutes of the waitress bringing the menus. There was nothing on the table when we arrived. no cutlery no sugar no ketchup. we had to ask every single time. we waited for our food for about 50 minutes. People were getting their food who arrived after us.  We got our food and I order pancakes and fruit. The pancakes were alright. I've had better. The fruit tasted like onion so we asked that it be sent back because they must of used a knife to cut the fruit. When we got a \"new\" bowl of fruit it looked like it had been washed and given back to us and still tasted like onion. So we sent it back a second time and we decided not to have any fruit.  After I believe a manager, woman with glasses and shirt brown hair, approached us And said she apologized we began to explain to her that it must of been cut with a knife that was used for onions and if someone was allergic to onion it would of been bad. She actually started speaking back to us so rudely she said \" No not that many people are allergic to onion, and that it's a neutral vegetable\" honestly ridiculous. the point was that fruit is NOT supposed to taste like onion and not answer back to a customer. We then we're approach by the waitress who said that some items would be taken off the bill to compensate for the fruit. The manager removed a $2 cappuccino.   I would of rather paid for it. All and All terrible experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The chicken & waffles were awesome, the home fries were prefect and the pancakes were what pancakes suppose to taste like. Crispy edges and fluffy on the inside!  The staff were quick, efficient, and the food came out hot and fast! If was just a bit pricey for breakfast and the coffee tasted watery."}
{"text":"I will never come here again. I found a dead fly in my coffee AFTER i already took a sip and they did nothing about it. They didn't even apologize. Didn't bother to comp anything. The sanitary conditions of this place is disgusting."}
{"text":"So I've wanted to try this place for ever and Im happy I finally did. We went on a Sunday and only waited 10 mins.  The food really looks like the pictures. I haven't  been this happy about Brunch since last year. Our waitress was efficient , professional and so friendly. The food portions size was generous, fresh and so delicious. Comfortable Seating and lots of parking."}
{"text":"Today I decided to visit Evviva after sometime. We went for a nice breakfast on the patio, well I was expecting a nice breakfast. Evvia is one of my favourite places to go for breakfast, especially their smoke salon eggs Benny, but unfortunately today I left with disappointment. As for one, the staff was completely new and lost. Secondly, I don't mind waiting for my meal and I understand it takes time especially when business is busy but when it comes out tasting disgusting it gets really upsetting. My smoked salmon  tasted like sand paper and the fruit salad had only melons and two slices of strawberries. Thirdly, My service was extremely poor as my server kept forgetting my simply requests. I had to ask several times and yet she still didn't get my brown sugar or butter. I had to ask another server. I am very disappointed in the quality of the food and service. Evvia today has truly given me a different view on great food and service."}
{"text":"Sometimes I forget that the Vaughan Mills area has all these different restaurants on the outside plazas, and Evviva is one of them. When there's breakfast all-day, they are bound to be a hit!  The inside of the restaurant was quite small, but they still decided to cram it full of seats. Unfortunately, this meant that your meal could get a little uncomfortable since there was someone right beside you on both sides.  The food was very good though. It did take quite a bit of time for the food to get out of the kitchen (I'm assuming because they packed in customers like sardines in a can, and the orders just kept getting backed up). Everything was quite good, with decent sized portions.  The service was quite odd though. Even though they had quite a few servers working, We didn't get much service. When we did, our server really seemed to hate her job.  A little too busy for my liking, so I would not recommend if you enjoy eating more leisurely."}
{"text":"After a crazy weekend my best friend and I decided to stop by and have some food before we went home. When we got there we had to wait about 20 minutes to get a table. The place was popping there were other families waiting as well with us. We got a seat, and the waiter was really sweet and brought over chilled water. We ordered there fresh orange juice which was so refreshing. I didn't want anything too heavy so I ordered the French toast which came with fresh fruits. The food tasted amazing. The place is a bit small for larger crowds. Even for two seats we were seated between other people and felt a like awkward listening to there conversations. But overall the restaurant is really cute, and the food was really good. I would love to go again!"}
{"text":"Nice place for breakfast. Price is fair and the quality is good. They boil the eggs however you want them. The patio is nice too."}
{"text":"Extremely average, service was good but that's about it. Pictures are not at all what they seem to be. There was a single piece of avocado on the breakfast sandwich and my omelette was something i could have made. Probably would not go back to be honest."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday. The eggs weren't cooked right! My omelette was over cooked. The service was horrible! Once I was served the waitress disappeared. I didn't finish my omelette ......I got up paid and left.  By the way the coffee was ok!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since high-school (5+ years)! This is a great local breakfast/brunch place in Vaughan. Based on my experience, the place is usually busy and sometimes I even have to wait 10mins in line for a table.   FOOD: Simply delicious and doesn't feel too heavy and oily in my opinion! I usually get the egg Benedict dishes with smoked salmon! There's also one with baby spinach if you want another alternative. There is also free-refills on coffee. Their omelettes are also pretty decent and their overall menu has a large variety of breakfast and brunch items (mid-range pricing). However, you may want to avoid ordering sides because when I asked for extra sausages once, they charged me an extra $3.   SERVICE: Consistently been getting good service over the years so far.   Picture below from my foodgram: @jules_eatingood"}
{"text":"Freshly squeezed OJ is what I live for when I come to this place. No disappointments anytime I go here. Good service every time. I always order the steak & eggs mhmmm. Also I can't wait till their relaxing patio is open so I can drink my OJ on it :P"}
{"text":"The 6 AM All-Day-Breakfast sign got me in the door.  Evviva Breakfast & Lunch takes the place of the previous Oriental Buffet.  Once inside it is not the same atmosphere as you would think of your typical Sunset Grill or Cora's.  Think in terms of wooden panel walls, cushioned booth seating, small artsy framed pictures along with a few classy light fixtures.  Think of it this way.  I was eating 3-Eggs, Sausage, Toast and Homefries($4.99) while listening to Classic Opera and some Latin Beats.  At least I was dressed for it arriving here for Lunch from work.  Cappuccino($2.49) was more suitable here than your average Cup of Joe.    The Food did come out fast as I expected.  Not much to complain about except of course for some reason the packaged Jams already on the tableside were liquidy.  Whole Grain Toast is a good option to have.  Homefries were nicely seasoned not needing the daily dose of Catsup/Ketchup.  I just wonder who will show up at 6 AM?"}
{"text":"My friend and I were pretty disappointed. We decided to come here for breakfast as she and her family are regulars, and highly recommended the place. We're pretty sure that the waitress we had was new, although that isn't an excuse for the service we received.  After we had gotten our waters, they were not refilled a single time through the entire meal, but it seemed like the people around us had mostly full water glasses.  My friend ordered the Montreal lox, and I ordered the eggs Benedict. Things were still going okay at this point, but then she asked us what toast we wanted with the lox and the eggs Benedict. My friend and I were a bit confused, but she said white and I said whole wheat, thinking that she was referring to the bagel and English muffin, respectively.  Our food came out in a timely fashion, but to our surprise, they had made her Montreal lox as a sandwich between two pieces of white toast, and my eggs Benedict on whole wheat toast. We were both extremely confused, as neither of us had ever seen this before, but we didn't make a big deal out of it, and ate them anyway.  Halfway through the meal, my friend found a white hair in her side of home fries. It was undeniably a hair. She didn't want to cause a commotion, so she decided to wait until after the meal to let our server know. When she did, the waitress barely apologized, and didn't do a single thing to rectify the situation. We saw her bring the plates directly into the kitchen, and drop them off without telling anyone.  When she brought out our bills, my friend had noticed that they had charged her 11 dollars for her meal, when the menu said 10. We had to call over another older waiter (possibly the manager?), and we had to wait for them to reprint the receipt. My friend was fairly upset at this point, as she hadn't gotten the meal she wanted, any refills on water, a hair in her food, and a bill overcharging her. We just wanted to pay and get out, but when she had gotten her change, we found that she was short 50 cents. It's not a lot of money, but it was frustrating after all of the other events. We alerted the same other man again, and he directed her to replace the change. I'm pretty sure that he made her use her tips to fix the change, and her attitude with us was very apparent. Even after all this, we thought we could just get the two quarters and move on, but she gave the wrong change again, and had handed my friend a nickel. This would have been fine, but when my friend told her, she immediately disagreed, and didn't even apologize when my friend was showing her and she had to change it again.  Evviva has a positive reputation for good food and service. It's just a shame that we didn't have that experience, especially when my friend and her family are regulars."}
{"text":"It's rare to find a breakfast joint with this much style.   They made me a perfectly cooked omelette. Fresh fruit and veggies, a little bacon and a good slice of seedy toast with butter. Don't forget that hot cup of quality dark coffee. I'm in food heaven and all before 8:00am.  Everything about this place is high quality, it's kept very clean, staff are friendly and well trained. My coffee was constantly refilled and kept hot. The kitchen does breakfast right. My veggie omelette was perfect; not burnt like some other places ive been to recently. And they had a huge selection of other breakfast fare incase you feel like something different.  The one downside is the price. It's certainly more expensive than whatabagel or sunrise grill. That said, the food is much much higher quality, so no star deductions from me for this point. While this might not be your everyday breakfast joint because of the price, it's definitely where I'd be bringing someone for a special breakfast out. Maybe if you want to impress those in-laws."}
{"text":"We came here in the afternoon, 3pm, not knowing they closed at 4pm. The waitress informed us that they were closing soon but let us sit anyways.  I ordered the Florentine Eggs Benedict and my friend got the crown burger.  My eggs benny had gross spinach water stains (I hope!) on the plate, and the Hollandaise sauce seemed like it had been sitting on the eggs for a long time before they brought it out. The homefries were pretty good, but they were really salty.   The water we got had stuff floating in it so it was a bit off-putting, making the salty homefries harder to consume.  For $35 total, we both thought our food was pretty mediocre and a bit overpriced.   Maybe we'll try sunset grill next time."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Great, prompt and friendly service. Prices have gone up over the years, but that's expected with inflation, but the quality of food has remained the same - great.  The reason for the 4 star rating is I've noticed the last few visits we've heard nothing but Adele music. Seriously, that $h!t is depressing to listen to when you're trying to enjoy all day breakfast. Cut her, and go back to the variety music you had before. This is not enjoyable and I'll have to seriously consider going somewhere else if this continues. I'd be a Shane cuz I drop at least $50 - $60 a visit.  I hope the management reads this. Your choice in music is what's giving you the less than perfect rating."}
{"text":"Good selection... good value... busy, but didn't have to wait long.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"Poor service but cheers to the food Couple improvements could be made  Check in lady could say names louder or actually walk to customers and ask for their names *had to go up to her and ask if my name was called which she claimed was a while ago* Not sure if it was either short staff today or not but received next to no service meanwhile a table of 8 got all the waiters helping"}
{"text":"Consistently good. We come at least once/week for brunch and every time it's exactly what we expect.   They should only serve maple syrup though so be sure to ask for it since most orders come with table syrup. Also their pancakes are not worth it so don't order them."}
{"text":"3.5  I love this place because it is cozy and it serves brunch.  I have been here a few times and the reason for the 3.5 stars is because the service has been slow. Like other yelpers...I agree...they are ongoing understaffed. It's just that the times I have been there, I always see a lady walking around...observing?!...and when you waive at her, she does not respond. I am thinking that she is the owner.  The food is great, consistent, just the odd time when the fries are over-salted or the chicken gets a burnt taste. The menu is has things that is for everyone. I will for sure visit again (bright and early to avoid long wait times)"}
{"text":"3.5  Came here for the first time yesterday for hangover brunch. This place was moderately busy but not full, and we were seated fairly quickly. We both ordered the bacon, sausage, ham and egg combo which comes with toast, and home fries. (One order was with a side of avocado; $3 charge). There's a lot of really good looking things on the menu. I definitely want to go back to try the smoked salmon eggs Benedict.   The ham was really greasy but we let the bread soak it up. The sausage and egg were good, and the home fries were awesome. The bacon could have been more crispy. The side avocado was about quarter of an avocado, which for $3 seemed a bit chincey.   The service was average, took a bit of time flagging our server down to refill our water but she seemed pretty friendly. Not much more to say about it.   The decor of the place was nice, open and clean. The washrooms were clean as well. All in all this place is pretty decent, and I'll probably be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"I went here for a late morning snack with a friend during the week. The place looks great & it's clean. The employees are good but unremarkable.  We shared the evivva breakfast sandwich & it was really good. As we weren't really hungry splitting was a good idea. The home fries were ok but would have needed some herbs to jazz them up. They didn't give us a hard time for sharing the meal which was nice.  Overall ok but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"I love smoked salmon eggs Benedict. So this is what I ordered here. The food is fresh and the English muffin is crispy. That said, there is not much presentation on the plate. (I'm used to having the smoked salmon eggs Benedict's from Cora's and Eggspectations in Ottawa, which cost more or less the same price, but with carved fruits on a third or half of the plate.)  Another thing is that although there are lots of high chairs for small children, there is no change table in the washroom for babies. My sister-in-law had to go back to the car to change my niece's diaper."}
{"text":"Evviva...are you supposed to elongate the \"v\" sound since there are two?  was this a typo and never got fixed?  maybe the spelling was weird, but was hoping the food would be good.    Went on a Saturday for lunch.  all-day breakfast?  I'm all over that like a fat kid on a smartie, or so I hoped.  We got seated right away, but then were left with menus and blank expressions on our faces because no one came by asking what we'd like to drink or if we were ready.  10 minutes later, someone decided to address the table of Asians and ask what we wanted.  As I was waiting for my very simple BLT with home fries, I couldn't notice that the service staff were more concerned about gossiping with each other than servicing their tables.  (FYI, don't sit near the bar.  The servers kept on kicking the legs of my chair whenever they walked by and it was incredibly annoying.  Almost as though they didn't know how to walk - I even pulled my chair is as much as I could).   Once the food came, that blank expression came over my face again for two reasons.  One, why it took so long to make my BLT and my friend's omelette.  my BLT was lackluster and they must have given me 7 home fries.  Presentation sucked and my friend's omelette was overcooked.  Once we polished our plates, we decided to go for a snack afterwards elsewhere.  We finally got to pay the bill after waiting 15 minutes for our server to remember to bring the machine over and then left as quickly as we could.  Evviva, not the greatest food, but the worst service I've ever received.  Funny enough, I went prior to with a bunch of work people for lunch and never had an issue.  Swing and a miss on Saturday.  Once is enough.  Good bye Evviva.  never wanna see you again."}
{"text":"Decided to have brunch here with my mom on a Sunday. We came in at around noon and there was a line-up. I had never been to Evviva before and the reviews on Yelp aren't the greatest, but I was nearby and super hungry. So, I decided to give this place a try.  We waited for about 20 Minutes for a 2-person table and finally got a booth. The menu is pretty brunch-standard. They have omelettes, sandwiches, salads, waffles, etc. I decided to go for the Evviva omelette, which is essentially a veggie one with tomatoes, mushrooms, peppers, spinach and onions. It came with a side of toast and potatoes. The food was alright, nothing really special to be honest. The omelette was a bit oily and so were the potatoes. Nevertheless, I did finish it (the omelette, not the potatoes), so it was fine. I also had the maple latte, which was actually very nice! They have lactose-free milk, which is awesome.  My mom wanted coffee at first, but then decided midway through my meal that she wanted to try the berry waffle. So I completely forgot to take a picture of it, but it was huge and beautiful. And the waffle was super fluffy. I really enjoyed the waffle, more than the omelette actually.   I would come back here for their waffles that's for sure. They also have chicken and waffles on their menu, so I might be adventurous and try that out one day! Overall, the place is quite packed, so people do enjoy coming here. The omelette wasn't anything to rave about, but the waffle was quite nice as well as the latte."}
{"text":"Overall a great experience.  We arrived on a busy Sunday morning.  We had a group of 4 adults and 3 kids.   We were told there would be a 15-20 minute wait, and we were seated within that timeframe.  I had the smoked salmon sandwich on rye with yam fries.  It was quite good.  The food came out quickly, even though the place was operating at capacity.  We will likely return if we are in the area and need to get lunch or breakfast."}
{"text":"Despite all the negative reviews, we decided to give Evivva a shot. The experience wasn't bad but it wasn't stellar either, it was just meh.   I felt the food was just average in terms of taste and quality. I ordered the florentine egg Benny while my husband ordered eggs with sausage. The only thing I like on my plate was the homemade hollandaise sauce. My husband's sausage wasn't the best quality or taste either.  What we did like was the fact you can customize your sides without a charge. I opted for the fresh fruits while my husband chose the home fries which was fantastic.   Overall, we thought the service was great but the food was just average, not worth the price it charges."}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast and firstly it took one hour to get our food. It consisted of a burger, wrap, and three breakfast meals. The service was horrible , no one apologized for the wait or refilled our water. The food was not so tasty. Eggs were over cooked, my bacon was chewy(never had that before). The pancakes were undercooked.  When I told our server \"this was one of the worst meals I ever had\". She said \"really? Yeah we had a large party and we have a small kitchen and sometimes they rush things out\".  This was honestly the 2nd worst restaurant I ever ate at.  Horrible. Please don't try to keep this place going."}
{"text":"Good place, been there over 5 times, the food is good, the Eggs Benedict and the Avocado sandwich are my favorites, as well, I would recommended substituting the home fries with the fruits and trying their freshly squeezed orange juice."}
{"text":"Sit yourself and lacklustre service just left me empty and not willing to give them another shot.  I arrived at 8, an hour after they opened and it was empty, which was fantastic, place to myself a dedicated staff to  a VIP, me.   But alas it didn't seem like they cared much for a new face, a potential regular. I've received more fanfare at McDonald's.   The food was bountiful and delicious, but I could grab 2 early birds at other spots for the same price.  The facility was clean and food was good,  if I had received marginal service, I'd adventure back...   Definitely several eggs short of a dozen, 2.5 stars. Food and restaurant ambiance give it the nudge to 3."}
{"text":"Evivva is probably the only great brunch place in Vaughan. Service is always good, prices are decent and their menu items are tasty!  Service and Environment It gets really busy here during the weekends, so expect to wait around 15-20 minutes for a table, especially if you're coming in at around 10am-2pm. Their restaurant is very clean with a welcoming and sunny atmosphere. During the summer they have a beautiful patio outside with turf and big beach umbrellas for you to sit and enjoy your brunch! Servers here are super friendly and treat you with great respect.   Food They serve all day breakfast here and I personally think the prices are very reasonable as the portions here are pretty big! They also have the best home fries here; very crispy and seasoned perfectly. Eggs are usually cooked to perfection depending on how you like them and the sausages and bacon are great! One of my favourite menu items are the chicken and waffles - the fried chicken is crispy and seasoned well and the waffle is really fluffy! I recently also tried the Atlantic Salmon which comes with two sides of your choice, this was a lovely healthy option and the salmon was cooked perfectly! One of my friends tried their Gyro wrap and she personally thought that the meat was a bit on the saltier side.   Overall a good and popular brunch place in Vaughan!"}
{"text":"WOW. !!!!!!!  I admit when my friends told me they're taking me here to brunch I was a little uneasy having read previous reviews, but man was I wrong.  This place was GREAT. My friends and I sat outside, it was a beautiful warm day. Our server was great. She was very attentive and brought everything we asked for.   I ordered a Vanilla Iced Coffee, a Caramel Waffle, and a side of the breakfast potatoes well done.  Everything tasted soooooooo good. That waffle really hit the spot. It was savory and sweet and just what I was in the mood for. The potatoes were cooked great and went well with some ketchup. I know if I am ever in Toronto or Vaughan again, I will be coming here for breakfast."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Food is basic fare..nothing to get too excited about. Our last visit (Saturday morning - October 20, 2012) the service was dreadful. Restaurant was not busy...we ordered and our waitress disappeared and returned only once to check on us. Asked by another server if I wanted a refill of hot water for my tea....I responded yes and off she went. Never returned with my hot water. We had to ask for everything...cutlery, syrup for pancakes, cream, etc...even the bill. Dirty dishes sat in front of us for at least 10 minutes before they were cleared. Very disappointing. This service is not typical, usually the staff are attentive and friendly. Due to this last experience, I'm more inclined to try other restaurants in the area for bkfst in the future."}
{"text":"I have been going to Evviva for over 3 years now, 1 to 2 times per month. My last visit left me wondering if I will ever go back again. The servers were abundant and quick; the kitchen was painfully slow. I ordered a Montreal Smoked Meat sandwhich on RYE. My wife ordered side pancakes and side bacon. After about 25 long minutes our simple meal arrived. The pancakes were cold and my Montreal Smoked Meat sandwhich was served on toasted white bread. When we commented on the pancakes being cold they were replaced in a few minutes which was good. When I asked whether the kitchen ran out if rye bread our server apologized and said she would get me a side of rye bread. 10 minutes later, still nothing. Our server was shocked that the rye bread hadn't arrived and checked with the kitchen. After 5 more minutes I received toasted marbled white bread (ribbons of brown colored bread in the white). Ridiculous!! I said nothing, ate the smoked meat, left the bread and concluded a very disappointing breakfast.  The manager was present and never once came by to appolagize or even adjust the bill. The manager looked different from before as did a lot of the serving staff so I can only conclude that the restaurant is under new management."}
{"text":"I love the food here. Always fresh and I've never had a problem with my orders. The staff is always super friendly even in the early morning. It's always clean and well ventilated that the place doesn't smell of food.   Get the freshly squeezed orange juice! Soooo good!"}
{"text":"The service is absolutely horrible, the server brought my breakfast out 5-10 minutes before she brought everyone else's so mine was cold by the time everyone else got there food, and we had to ask multiple times to get a glass of water which should be give to you when you sit down. The food was fine, for me a little bland. I had smoked salmon eggs Benedict. The other people said the same of their meals, fine but not great. The prices are okay, for my meal am a coffee it was $15 including tax and tip.  There are way better breakfast places in this area that are equally or less expensive. I wouldn't return here."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a group of 5 and was overall disappointed with the quality of food and service that we received.   I ordered the chicken and waffles due to the positive reviews that I saw on Yelp however I was very disappointed in the portion size that I received. 4 small nuggets of dry, fried chicken was not what I had in mind (unfortunately I do not have a picture). The chicken wasn't terrible but was overlooked and dry. My meal was accompanied with a small cup of maple syrup and sour cream. The sour cream actually worked and was absolutely necessary to compliment the dryness of the chicken. They provided a small amount of maple syrup which was barely enough to moisten the waffle. When I asked for more syrup the waitress brought over another cup which was absolutely necessary for aforementioned chicken however she neglected to mention that it costs an extra $1.50 for syrup! She comped it at the end of the meal when we complained but the fact that they don't provide more syrup for a large waffle and fried chicken is disappointing.   Others at the table ordered steak and eggs, eggs and toast and two eggs benedicts. The hash browns were very crispy and well seasoned. For the eggs benedicts the server asked how they wanted their eggs prepared and my fiancée requested 'soft' however received poached eggs that were cooked solid. Runny eggs are a rather key element for eggs benedict however it wasn't a deal-breaker so we didn't send it back.   Overall, it was a mediocre meal that did not meet expectations. Given the price point (~$9-$14) and mediocre quality, I don't expect that we will be going here again."}
