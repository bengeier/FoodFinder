{"text":"This place serves big portions of food for a low price. They specialize in Northern Chinese Cuisine which means BBQ skewers, shared hot pots and other sharing dishes that have spices like red chili peppers and cumin. Note: they don't have any dumplings on their menu.  I ordered BBQ chicken hearts (4 skewers for $3.99), BBQ lamb (4 skewers for $4.99), stir fried spicy chicken bones ($5.00), duck with noodle soup ($7.99) and a tofu dish w/ pork ($6.99).  The skewers were great! The stir fried spicy chicken bones were interesting. Admittedly, I ordered them not knowing what they were. Although messy to eat, they were still delicious. The flavour was sweet and spicy with a bit of sour. Don't get this if you get frustrated with picking meat off the bones though. The duck noodle soup was great. The broth was not oily and had a smooth white pepper flavour. You can't go wrong with the fried tofu, this dish even came with some slivers of pork in it too. All in all, everything was tasty!  Next time I'll come with more people and try the hot pot and order a bunch of different skewers!"}
{"text":"The food was fresh and tasted amazing. Try the beef and lamb skewers. The food came quick and tasted great. Awesome place."}
{"text":"This is a really good place for BBQ, the price is relatively cheaper than other BBQ places. Half price lamb skewers every Tuesday ( $3 for 4 ). The flavours are good, but the BBQ vegetables were a bit saulty. Special mention to the BBQ chicken wings ( $6.99 for 4 ), totally worth the price. The spicy fish filet with bean sprout was good as well. Compare to other BBQ restaurant, this one has bigger portion servings. Overall, the restaurant was cleaned and tidy. Service was good and we didn't have to wait a long time for the food."}
{"text":"1 star service + 5 star food.  Service&environment side: (1 star) Silver star opened at 4 pm and we got in around 4:20pm, the entire restaurants was such a mess and they were still doing their cleaning. The chairs are everywhere and we needed to help them sort the chairs in order to get to a seat. When we sat down we asked for tea and they said since they only opened 20 minutes ago they don't have boiled water yet(which doesn't make any sense). Then they started to mop the floor, the smell of the chemicals in the water was so intense it hurts our noses. It didn't really bother me until they literally came directly to us and started mopping right next to our feet.   Food side:(5 star) I am still a foodie, and to be honest their skewers are amazing. Especially the chicken gizzard and lamb skewers!!!!!!! It is absolutely delicious! I'm super impressed! Personally I would suggest not to order the beef skewers because it is not that nice comparing to the lamb ones, and be sure not to order the pork belly, all u see is the fat. But anywayz, the portion is great, the seasoning is great. The food deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"I came wanting to try out one of their Asian Food Festival set meals. I was going to do the combo for 2 ($30), which included 1 BBQ meat item, 1 BBQ vegetable item, 1 fish/pork pot, 1 pan fried dish, and 2 bowls of steamed rice. As they don't have an online menu, I was sort of taking a stab in the dark as to the prices/actual menu items. Upon looking at their actual menu, I realized that not including the rice, the maximum one can save for this deal is about $3 (their pots and their pan fried items cap out at $10.99). Had I know that earlier, I probably wouldn't have tried it out. We decided to stay anyways, because their prices looked fairly reasonable.  Had:  Coriander wrapped in dried bean curd (3 skewers/$3.99) - This was a pretty decent portion for $3.99. Each skewer had 3 rolls on it, for a total of 9 rolls. This was quite pretty. The dried bean curd is not bean curd sheet. It's textured thin slices of firm tofu. The coriander is still crisp, and the chili oil brushed on the outside of each roll definitely didn't hurt. I quite dislike coriander, but this worked for me.  Squid on iron plate (2 skewers/$3.99) - This was the most disappointing dish of the night. Firstly, it wan't on an iron plate. It was on a ceramic plate. We inquired into this, and were told that they cook it on an iron plate in the kitchen (I doubt this highly), and then transfer it to a ceramic one. Secondly, the squid was quite chewy. I would not suggest that anyone order this. There's a reason they changed the price on the menu from $4.99 to $3.99. Sigh.  Pomfret fish (3/$4.99) - The fish weren't quite the same size, but also not bad for $4.99. The fish was crispy and had a spicy/sweet/savory hot sauce on it that to me, had a hint of bean paste in it. I ate the entire fish, head and tail included, save for the spine.  Chicken soft bone (4 skewers/$4.99) - Tasty, if you enjoy eating foods that have a fatty feel. I do. However, there were still parts of the soft bone that weren't soft. They took effort to eat.   Lamb kebab (4/$5.99) - For about $1.50/skewer, this is also quite a fair portion. It was also decent in taste and texture. I didn't get any fat chunks, nor did I get any super chewy pieces. Quite tasty. They have a special (only in Chinese) that says that on Tuesdays, they have 4 lamb skewers for $3. I'm hoping that they're the same size and made of the same meat. I'm planning on coming again for these.  Beef pancake ($4.99) - I'm a sucker for this dish. I try it at most Northern restaurants that I can find it at. This one is one of the cheaper ones I've seen. They usually go for $5.99-$6.99. While this one is cheaper, it is slightly smaller. I suppose in that way, the price does balance out. This one is quite tasty. There's a decent amount of beef in it, and the beef is tender. I believe I detected a hint of ginger in this, and I'm not a ginger fan, but it went quite well with this dish. I might order this one again, if I needed just a bit more to add to my meal.  Rice noodle with clams in sesame paste ($7.99) - This was us being adventurous. The rice noodles are more like thick vermicelli? Not as thick as udon, but almost like spaghettini in thickness? Something like that. The soup base was like a less peanut-y dan dan soup base, but very tasty. There were a decent amount of clams in the bowl, and I really liked that they had pieces of bean curd sheet in the bowl instead of filler veggies. The portion was also incredibly generous. This was the dish that impressed me the most tonight. I'd definitely order this dish again.  All in all, a fairly satisfying meal. Total damage for 3 adults was $41 and change before tips. We also brought home enough leftovers to feed at least one more adult. Good stuff. I'll miss Chinese Halal Restaurant, which used to be where this restaurant now is, but this is not a bad replacement."}
{"text":"Friend suggested this place for Chinese BBQ restaurant so we decided to come here. It's a Northern Chinese cuisine. The give you a big paper menu and check off what you want to order. I ordered the braised beef noodle soup as that's usually what I like. My friends ordered a variety of food including Lamb, fish, shrimp and squid skewers, fried noodles, fried potato slices and they all look good. Noodle was good too. Only thing is not enough meat as someone mentioned in a previous review. Will come back again to try other foods they have."}
{"text":"Key takeaway/advise: ask to confirm portion size, even if you think the menu is clear  Summary: price 3/5 food 2/5 speed 1/5 service 2/5  Price 3/5   Average. Not expensive, but I won't say it's cheap. We came in group of 9, and ended up with about 28 per person (including tax and tip). Food 2/5   Since this is a BBQ place, meat quality is really important. It's not the best place I tried, but it's not that bad, so average again. For example, the BBQ lamb skewer, you will find one piece that's too fat/hard to chew per 2 skewers, on average. What I don't like is the spice use. The spice on most of the items we ordered (lamb skewer, chicken heart, chicken wing, soft bones, etc.) tasted the same (salt, chili peppers, cumin) and is very overpowering, too salty and too spicy. Btw, they do have dumplings on their menu now. Serving speed 1/5   Very slow. Food started to come about 10 mins after we ordered. We ordered 4 servings of the lamb skewer, each serving being 4 skewers (per menu). We were served 12 skewers at first, and were told the rest will come shortly after. It never came. Well... not until the very end. We were eating and chatting, so we forgot about the missing lamb skewers. Right when we were about to call for the bill, we were brought another 4 servings (16 skewers) of lamb skewer... They can't track the orders very well, no idea how much food they already served. Oh and we also ordered BBQ squid but it never came, they missed it completely as it was also not on the bill. Service 2/5   After we've made our selection, they took the ordering sheet and we were left with nothing. Usually this is not a problem, but when the food come so slow, it became a problem. Food started to come about 10 mins after ordering. After a while, they stopped bringing us anything, so we thought they've served everything. With a big group of 9, it's impossible to keep track of the orders, especially when we don't have the order sheet anymore. We ordered a second round, and it turned out we still got about one quarter of the first order in the kitchen. For example, on our first order, we ordered 4 servings of chicken wings (the menu says each serving is 2 skewers). After a while, we got the wings, 8 pieces of wings in total, served on 4 skewers (2 wings on each skewer). When we thought the first order's been completed, we sent in the second order, and ordered 4 servings of the wings again. After a while, we got another 8 pieces of wings. So everything's perfect right? WRONG. About 20 mins after we got the second serving of 8 wings, they brought us more wings... 16 pieces of wings to be precise. Apparently 1 serving is 2 skewers and 1 skewer is 2 wings. So the first 8 wings and the second 8 wings are both part of our first order. And we ordered another 16 wings on the second order... 32 wings not that much for 9 people when you go to wings night or all you can eat wings, but we ordered and ate tons of other food already... So we told them it's a bad order because the menu's not clear and they were too slow, but they refused to take the wings back, despite of the fact that the place is more than half full at the time and there will be more orders for wings from the other tables."}
{"text":"Pretty good late hours Chinese BBQ restaurant.  All around the food quality 3.5 stars and the pricing was 4 stars.  Tuesday is $3 for 4 lamb Skewers.  The lamb was not fatty enough but the price is absolutely unbeatable!!  Coors light is $3/bottle, house draft is $6/pitcher!  The Pork Belly Pan Fry was amazing!!' It's so fatty and it was perfectly cooked! Some were crispy, some were really tender. Needless to say it was super flavourful because it was half fat and half meat. The amount of cumin was perfect!  Other dishes we had were great. I would reorder the beef tendon skewer, BBQ chives, spicy black fungus salad, chicken soft bone Skewers.  The Pork Bone pot with potato noodle, dill napa, co-fu (cold-tofu) was not bad.. would want the Pork Bone to be more tender, then it would get 4 stars..  The bill for 3 ppl came up to $69 plus tip. We had 6 bottles of Coors Light and we couldn't finish the food.  Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was wonderful and I enjoyed the atmosphere. Must try their house special noodles."}
{"text":"Service is the only reason I can see to complain. Wednesday night only to servers.. but almost full house.   The food was good, kebobs not too spicy, good amount of meat on the kebobs. The cold noodle I had was not salty and missing kimchi but had spicy paste, better than Yang's bbq's cools noodle.   The stewed beef noodle is $7.99, maybe like 6-8 small pieces of beef, huge bowl. Like congee queens superbowl congee sized. Enough to fill two, with fresh tomatoes and Bok Choy. Hand pulled noodle??? Anyhow very tasty and good flavour in the broth, it's like a order of the stewed beef soup but with noodles at no additional charge. :)"}
