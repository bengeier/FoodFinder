{"text":"I have been coming to Siam for years. This place is a hit or miss. I noticed the food quality can decrease when the restaurant is at full capacity. Even with that said, this probably is one of the few good quality Chinese restaurants in \"Chinatown\".   I actually have not dined at Siam for a few months, so when a group of friends wanted to meet up for dinner, I was looking forward to the meal. We had a group of 9, so we thought it was easier and more economical to order from the already prepared family style dinner menu.    It was a good combination of pork, chicken, seafood and beef. The simple noodle dish had stir fry thin noodles and some bean sprouts. Yum. I enjoyed the seafood the most. Seafood included a soup, lobster and a seafood hot pot. Dessert was tapioca with taro, unfortunately my bowl lacked the taro. Dessert is normally free, but sometimes you have to ask for it!   My other all time favorite dishes is the snow pea pods, clams with black bean sauce, beef with wide rice noodles and the ground basil chicken.   Come with a group of friends, so you can enjoy a little of everything! :)"}
{"text":"Well worth the drive from the burbs. Best chicken satay and peanut sauce, crispest spring rolls ever, Pad Thai to die for. And very affordable!!"}
{"text":"I love this place ... it's one of the only places in metro Cleveland that is open after 10 pm on a weeknight, and the food isn't bad either.  Actually they're open til midnight every night, and allegedly, they don't close on any holiday.   You often see large tables of Asian clientele, and I think that says something.  My partner is Chinese and he's pretty picky about the cuisine of his people, and while there isn't any Chinese restaurant here in Cleveland that he thinks is excellent, this place and Wonton Gourmet are his favorites.  They have all the sticky, sweet things that the white people like to eat, and they have a whole range of stuff that caters to the Chinese palate too.  We often see people getting dishes that we can't find on the menu.  My favorites stand-bys are the crispy pan-fried noodles, the beef & tendon casserole stew, the fried tofu and the braised tofu.  I also like their General Tso's Chicken, but as any Asian knows, that not real Chinese food.  Their prices are very reasonable as well.  Four people can eat for $40 dollars and leave quite full.  Again, I really like this place and I'm giving it four stars, but  - DISCLAIMER - they are four Cleveland-ranked stars."}
{"text":"We have been loving this place for many, many years!  The food is always delicious and the owners are always supervising to assure our meal and service are top notch.  In addition to their extensive menu, they were happy to improvise a special dish for my daughter (west coast version of basil chicken) and my mother (steamed diet and plain blah) on 2 different occasions.   The most gracious service anywhere. They truly make you feel welcome and valued as a diner."}
{"text":"For Ohio, this place should be 5 stars for asian food but since I grew up out in Cali, its tough to compare this place to everything else.  I relied heavily on this place to get my asian fix when I lived there.  I usually got the squid with spicy salt, chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, beef tenderloin, and beef pan friend noodles.  The owners are super nice and the staff is generally very on top of things.  I still think this is the best place in cleveland for asian food =)"}
{"text":"The absolute best Chinese food in Cleveland.  My family and I have been frequenting Siam for 5 or so years now, every time, we receive outstanding food and service. This is the only place I ever ask to go on my birthday and I celebrated at Siam on the occasion of my high school graduation.   Don't be fooled by its shady look! The food is as authentic and delicious as it gets. Curry Vegetables, Bubble Tea, and the Pork Buns are always crowd pleasers.  Huge platters of food allow for family-style sharing. Because having a conversation and trying new things is what this is all about in the end, right?"}
{"text":"I first discovered this place about 15 years ago and the food today is just as amazing as it is today. The environment is great for geoup parties, dates with that special someone, or as a spot for downtown business meetings. I highly recommend the Chicken Cashew with an order of spring rolls on the side! I'm hungry just thinking about it! -- Also, the service is great and the staff is very attentive. Although parking can be an issue at times, the fill up because the place is very popular. It is also open every day until around 10 or 11 PM."}
{"text":"Cons:  - Expensive  - Very basic seasoning and sloppy presentation. Many dishes tasted similar even though they were named completely differently (Ie: basil beef vs. fish with tofu).   Pros: - Friendly service - Homely atmosphere  - Open on Christmas eve and day"}
{"text":"i found this restaurant from a friend and, i have to say that it was the best place i have ever been to for a Chinese restaurant,the staff was very nice and helpful and explained the menu (because so of those dishes you see them carrying look so good), and the Chinese beer is really good. if you are just a regular guy and want a restaurant that wont break your wallet this is the place for you..."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I come here about twice a month. Good food. Good portions, staff are nice. Only thing is, sometimes they don't always have everything on the menu other than that we love it here."}
{"text":"Wow, I thought Bo loongs was good (which is across the street), Siam Cafe is AMAZING.  The food there is great, I always get the same dish since I started going there  (general tso chicken).  the service is wonderful, the food is great, and the portions are always huge.  for Chinese food, I'm going here from now on...well worth the drive!!!"}
{"text":"No other Asian restaurant will do after you eat here. Meat and seafood with winter melon soup is delicious, it's like egg drop with pork, shrimp, and small pieces of melon. I've tried lamb, beef, chicken, and seafood dishes here. My favorite has to be the Seafood Curry, lots of shrimp, mussels, scallops, and squid in a delicious curry sauce. Great place to go if you can get over the location."}
{"text":"Me and my friend had been eating there regular for years. We didn't even need the menu to order and knew the bosses and servers.  Food was just average, but the quality was consistent.  One time, my friends ordered the seafood noodle soups and both them were sicked and got Gastroenteritis (vomit and diarrhea).  I will not go there again."}
{"text":"Best Authentic Chinese Food In Cleveland!  All of the Chinese students and friends I know including myself who spent 22 years in China agree that Siam cafe has the best Chinese food in Cleveland.   Recommend Basil Chicken, a little spicy but it's an unique dish that I can't find anywhere else, many of my friends make it a must-order dish at Siam cafe. Try Black pepper beef, seafood dish and Japanese toufu, or anything that's authentic Chinese dishes (no general Tsao's chicken, that's not real Chinese food!) They also have Chinese hotpotand other off-menu items.  Price is very fair, most dishes are priced at $10-15, we always have leftover cause the dish portion is so large, Siam cafe also provide free rice and dessert soup, which is also a plus.  Cons: The only dishes that disappoint me is the Singapore fried rice noodles, too oily and heavy curry flavor for me,  well it's not really Chinese dish so that doesn't change the fact that Siam cafe has the best Chinese food in Cleveland!!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Siam Cafe since I was a child.  This restaurant is (in my opinion) the best for Asian Cuisine in Cleveland.  The staff is fast and friendly.  The food is delicious.  The prices are reasonable.  I've lived in Columbus, Chicago, New York and I still crave my favorite dishes from Siam.  For large parties, I highly recommended their dinner packages.  I'm now a vegetarian but the meat dishes in those packages were truly AMAZING.  My favorite dishes in those packages were the beef, stir-fried noodle (veggie), and pork.  Since I've been a vegetarian, I've also explored their veggies options.  They have a braised tofu that is great!  Siam Cafe has provided me with some of my best family memories!  I hope this restaurant never closes."}
{"text":"This saddens me.....not sure when my palate turned the proverbial corner on this place but it was right before we watched a waiter bring a huge vat-o-soup to a neighboring table and watched him serve (ladle) scoop fulls of hot bun  bo hue to eagerly awaiting customers. He slightly nodded and wished them..in my estimation, bon appetite! Our mouths watered with anticipation for the same presentation.  Much to our surprise, the same waiter brought the same soup to our table....sat it down...placed the serving ladle in the vat-o-bun bo hue and walked away without spriceless. a ?? (enjoy).  We shared a silent \"wtf\" amongst our table guest.   I shrugged off feelings of embarrassment as I had bragged about this place to friends and family and chalked it up to \"must be an off night?  Fast forward to the dish I'd ordered each visit....crispy fried whole fish.   Our table mates entrees arrived slowly..  which is unusual, but my crispy fried fish arrived when everyone was finished. it  was the worst ever.stale, old and over cooked. I should have known by the side way glances from the wait staff that something was amiss.   Usually the owner visits each table, but we were avoided that night.   sad to say we have not returned since that night. when I do suggest Siam,I am met with this reminder: seriously?  in this economy, second chances are priceless."}
{"text":"I live in Atlanta and every time without fail I go to Siam Cafe when I am in town. It is were me and my friends go for good food and great times. First time I went I went twice in one day. I like the green tea ice cream to finish a meal. As to the food thank god for variety. From appetizers to desert you can find something you like. I really enjoy the pepper beef ribs."}
{"text":"This place was just okay, some items were great but some, like the lobster was subpar. We ate dinner here and were seated after a short wait. The owner was attentive as we looked at the menu, but it was 25 minutes before we got water and the waitress took our order.  Highlights here were the egg drop soup, the green beans and the E- fu noodles with tofu added. 2 at our table got the lobster and neither was tender or sweet. The black bean sauce was tastier then the garlic sauce. For us not worth the long drive into town."}
{"text":"I like this place. I've had really good tofu dishes here, and I always order the tom kah gai soup. it's better here than I've had at a lot of restaurants in a lot of different cities. The pad Thai is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food in Cleveland!  Great food and great service.  What a pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"Here's whatcha need to know. It's a big restaurant with lots of tables, but it's not loud. Big menu, most of which seems of fair-poor quality and loaded with sugary or over-salted sauces. The pho is terrible. BUT, the vietnamese rice dishes make the trip worth it, they are huge and cheap and always excellent.  So, uneven dish selection but the atmosphere and a few of the dishes make it worth it."}
{"text":"In reading these reviews, I feel like it's my duty to champion the Siam Café. We've had a very intimate relationship over the years. Many sit-ups were done in the name of the Siam Cafe.   When it is my birthday, when I come into town, when it's Mother's or Father's Day, after church when all the other places are closed, when I got dumped, when at the stage of a relationship and I wanted to see the unnatural limits of how much a human body could consume, I went to the Siam Café.   There are multiple waiters that I have seen come and go, but there is only one that you will ever want. He's a tall Asian man with the skinniest looking, drawn in moustache you'll ever see. The man is a matradee.  Don't order fried rice, noodles, lo mein, or anything that you have ever ordered at a Panda Express. If that's what you want, stay there, but here in the Siam Café, be bold and take chances with your diet: the clams in black bean sauce, the boiled chicken, seafood platter, the wonton soup, and the beef tenderloin.  I won't argue that the place will get busy, but like others said, they are catering to parties of ten or more. Don't be shy here. Raise your hand or yell out for a waiter. If the staff doesn't get to you, the hostess or host will find you. Rarely do I ever see anyone simply standing around here.   \"Long in the tooth?\" An expression that is such a telling statement on itself. The place was a converted family restaurant and not too much has changed but I don't go there for the atmosphere. I go there for the food. It's my hopes that anyone who goes there goes for that single purpose.  The Siam Café is the place to take your loved ones and if you have love great food. If you ever need a recommendation here, feel free to message me. I am the Siam Café's People's Champ. But if I get back into town, you might have to treat me."}
{"text":"I think Pork knuckle is the best, this dish is a huge portion , I have to take home and can eat it for several days.   pork with basil  which tasted good as well.  paradise shrimp is ok. I don't quite like the area around the restaurant. but the food is good, reasonable price and portion."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been going to this place for years. Fast service, friendly and the food is always on point! I really enjoy their Thai beef basil, beef pad Thai  and yum na (steak) salad."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The food is very authentic and the flavor is phenomenal. I love the house fried rice and the beef with ginger and chives. Best Asian restaurant in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the greater Cleveland area. The food is delicious and the staff is very kind. I ordered the pad Thai and it was a good sized portion for a very low price. My boyfriend got the sweet and sour chicken and enjoyed it very much."}
{"text":"Of the handful of Chinese restaurants in Cleveland, this one seems to be the most mediocre. It's redeemed by the large menu and wide variety of cuisines, including some Vietnamese and Thai dishes. However, much of the food could probably be fresher and the Chinese dishes are not very authentic."}
{"text":"Such a pleasant surprise! We have only been here once, but we are coming back, hopefully soon! We were invited to a \"tiny wedding\" (which I just loved how it was presented that way... an exchanging of vows by two friends outside at the Cleveland Museum of Art. We met up with them at a small gathering at Siam Cafe. The food was delicious. First, whatever you have, you must include an order of the Green Beans. They were as perfect as this dish can ever be!! Always a FAVorite for me.  I had Pad Thai and I will want that again and again. The menu is extensive, with creative dishes that brave souls other than me will be ordering. Our lovely large round table sported a spinning center, so the abundance of food was easily passed in circles if you wanted to try anothers... that is, if you could let go of your plate and share!!  Siam Cafe proves, you can grow up in Greater Cleveland, but you can never know every single place you need to try out! I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant to a couple or a large group."}
{"text":"So many options. So much food. So reasonably priced. It's also open late. Siam Cafe is one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Ordered the Tom yum soup. Seems as though the soup was concocted in the kitchen by adding ingredients as required. It was ok but the ingredients didn't have a chance to marry. I shrimp and mushrooms, Chili paste and either vegetable broth or chicken broth. Next got the pad Tai and fried fish with bean sauce. One person said the fish was flounder. Another said it was grouper. It was ok but I wouldn't order again. Pad Tai was fair. All in all our dishes were somewhat low spice to bland.  Stick with the chow dun or fried rice to be safe. Food isn't  bad but would try something else next time."}
{"text":"Fantastic lobster and Minglu roast duck! My favorite Chinese restaurant until now in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I've been twice now to Siam and had very nice meals both times.  I've become a fan of Jelly Fish!  It is so good.  Both times, my meals were consistently good.  The menu, for my taste, is too big - it makes choosing overwhelming.  I had a wonderful friend as my companion both times however and she (being a fan of the Siam) knew exactly what to order.  The wait staff and pleasant and friendly.  The overall atmosphere is comforting and family feeling."}
{"text":"We stopped on a Sunday night around 4pm. For us, it was a really late lunch. We were in the mood for Pad Thai, and Siam Cafe didn't disappoint. Great flavor, perfect noodles, and well seasoned. Restaurant was fairly busy for 4pm. You know it's good when that many people are there. Service was good, too. Overall great place to stop - be forewarned, the menu is VERY extensive. So many options to choose from, it might take you a while to sort out what to get. Every time a dish walked by on a tray, I would get FOBO! They all looked great."}
{"text":"Siam Cafe! They are open all the time. They have a liquor license. They offer the usual \"American Chinese\" fare for the Caucasians, especially at lunch (General Tso's chicken, fried rice, noodles, and so on). There is plenty of seating. But what about the really great, hidden secrets about the Siam? Well, there's the friendly greeting. Then, there is the fact that  they have round tables for larger groups. You can take over a table and make it your own. Play dice, cards, whatever. They won't mind. But what about the food? Please do yourself a favor and take a gander at the dinner menu (they will serve any dinner items at lunch, too) and wander outside the realm of familiarity. I started to do this about a year ago. Every time I go in there (about once a week) I make a point to order something I've never had before. We took a group for lunch/dinner on Sunday at 1:00 (they start serving alcohol then.) We ordered a whole fresh fish (taken out of the tank and cooked right then) with black bean sauce. WONDERFUL! We ordered the fantastic \"side pork braised with taro\" (or it comes with preserved vegetable). I can testify that if you like pork, you will die and go to heaven over this dish prepared either way. It is essentially a side of bacon that is seasoned and braised and interspersed with taro (a potato-like root vegetable that's more delicious than a potato) or preserved vegetable (crunchy who-knows-what and good!) and it was a HUGE hit with my group of unadventurous eaters. They transcended their expectations and raved like madmen about how we have to go every Sunday from now on! Then, the leftovers I used the next day by sauteeing the bacon with fresh shallots until crispy and adding a huge pile of fresh watercress and arugula. WOW! What a great leftover. I must highly recommend this dish. The server tried VERY hard to dissuade me from ordering it. She said \"Caucasians no like!\" But I persisted. I have had some other really wonderful things there. They run the gamut between Cambodian, Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese. Highly recommend most of the soups. The corn soup and the fish maw soup are Chinese style and cornstarch-based; very mild, bland flavor for unadventurous eaters. Try the other soups instead. Their salads are stellar. One features romaine, lemon grass, and seared-medium rare marinated flank steak. FANTASTIC! You can also get that one with grilled shrimp. Resist the temptation to just order the regular Chinese stuff. Go outside your normal inclinations and order the tofu dishes, the eggplant dishes, or anything soft-shell-crab. The crab with green onion and ginger is delectable. Salt-baked soft shell crab was fantastic. They also have a huge tank with Dungeness crabs and they will snag one out and cook it however you want. What a treat!  We really love Siam Cafe. Don't go to SC expecting it to be like a Chinese restaurant. It's not that. It's more than that.   Update! Feb. Super bowl Sunday. Escaping from football.This is the place! Super crowded because the New Year (Rat?) starts this week. We had 8 people. We got the last table. Here's what we had: stuffed chicken wings. GOOD. Always good. Tom yum goong soup. Emphasis on yum. Spicy, brothy, shrimp, mushrooms. Then Pad Thai, classic preparation. Vegetable lo mein. Great, with fresh  shiitakes and Chinese broccoli. A good basic. A whole large mouth bass from the tank, prepared with black bean sauce and lots of onions and ginger and peppers and fresh cilantro. If you dig the whole fish (bones, skin, etc) it is GREAT. Also, a whole braised pork hock. GrrrmmmmmmmmmGOOD STUFF. Brontosaurus bone, skin, bones, soft and yummy meat. A true caveman's paradise. Had some other stuff, too. We ate and drank ourselves silly and left a great tip for $30 a person. Then we came home, ate some more, and sent home leftovers. Three delightful meals and (copious) drinks, $10 per person averaged out per meal, friendly and sincere service, and delightful vittles. The usual. Highly recommend.  UPDATE: Did I mention the Oyster, scallion and ginger in pot? WOW!!! The salt and pepper spicy whole shrimp? Assorted meats and tofu in pot? Curry vermicelli noodles with chicken? Duck Choo Chee? Massaman curry anything?"}
{"text":"I just moved to Cleveland, and was not expecting to find any decent Asian food.  A lady at an Asian market recommended this place to my parents, and oh my god.  So delicious, probably the best Asian food I've had in the states for a good few years.  We ordered the braised pork hock, and it was bigger than my head!! They bring it out on this huge plate and cut it up in front of you.  The skin portion is so tender and juicy, and the meat literally just falls apart as you pick it up with your chopsticks.  We also got black pepper sauce spare ribs, which were cooked very nicely.  The flavor was not too salty like a lot of places do.  The fried soft shell crab was pretty tasty too.    This place was an amazing surprise.  I'll definitely be coming back to get my fix of Chinese food!"}
{"text":"The food was 5 star. We had 3 soups, 3 appetizers, 4 entrees, and 3 desserts. In terms of taste, freshness, portion size, and price--we loved everything--for days --because we brought most of it home. The service gets 3.5 stars.  There was an ick factor because of the tablecloth. They cover a starched white linen tablecloth with fresh white paper there, but the part of the cloth that was uncovered had seen better days. Ick--but we'll definitely be back there because of the great food."}
{"text":"The best. Not sure there's much else to say.  Siam Wings (if you've never had them, you owe it to yourself to ruin all other chicken wings ever by ordering these), Pork Belly with Taro, Salt Bake Squid, Half Roasted Duck, Fried Lobster (best eaten there), Curry Vegetables, and their Bubble Tea are all in constant rotation.  Their food is just as good to go as it is dining in and that's hard to come by these days. Very friendly staff and they keep late hours. When it comes to having pride in their business and enjoy serving others, there's not many that can hold a candle to Siam Cafe. Been coming here for close to 10 years and never had a bad meal...here's to another 10."}
{"text":"Siam Cafe is the best place for Chinese food. Very wide variety menu and the seafood is very fresh. I like the spicy chicken dishes.  If you go in the weekend, its tends to be very busy.  Many downtown workers go there for lunch, so it won't be alone like some other restaurants. They serve some Vietnamese and Thai dishes."}
{"text":"Been here twice on both trips to Cleveland since it is my girlfriends mothers favorite. They have really great chinese food and it is pretty affordable. They give you A LOT of food and everything that I have had is really good. If you like traditional chinese and american chinese I recommend it"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese restaurant in cleveland  My favorite dish here is golden garlic fried lobster fish fillet with thai sauce and siam wings with yang cho fried rice  They have lots of feesh stuff like crab lopster flounder fish live shrimp and claims those are pricey but worth to try once in a while  Overall their quality of service and foods are enjoyable"}
{"text":"Stopped in to Siam Cafe one lazy Friday in late June for lunch. It was a bit early (11:30) so there were only a few tables taken. I ordered the shrimp with lobster sauce with curried rice. Service was prompt and the portion was nice and big, with lots of shrimp. It wasn't the greatest meal I've ever had, but it was good, and definitely a good value for the price. I will be back to try some of the other items on the extensive menu. A little side note, a popped in to Siam Cafe a couple weeks later to grab a carry-out menu, again during lunch but this time about 1:15, and it was packed, I mean all but maybe 2 tables were taken. For me, this is a good sign."}
{"text":"there is nothing fancy about the place. very comfortable and clean. no chandeliers nor fancy artwork, no big buddhas around, a simple fish tank, a bunch of family-style round tables, a couple of tables for 4 and booths for such.  it is a very welcoming place.  what we had  seafood with tofu and vegetable soup. ($8.95).  the soup came first, served around 10 seconds after the last person arrived. perfect timing.   it had the consistency of clear soup, with the ginger and vegetable flavors coming through. shrimp and squid were in abundance, and the tofu, great texture, not overcooked, but not too soft that it would break up. it had a lightness to it that provided a good start to a chinese meal.  satisfying.  (8 / 10).  yang chow fried rice. ($8.95).  this is usually a safe dish. but some restaurants manage to butcher it. it seems the flavors automatically come through with all ingredients mixed together, but no. sometimes, in other places, the yang chow fried rice is bland and tasteless. here they do it right.  yang chow fried rice had the usual components - chopped roast pork, shrimp, egg, scallions, cooked rice, touch of soy. but the flavors came out well, which made you not just spoon it, but also slurp it as you eat, if that made sense. good yang chow fried rice seems to pair well with any chinese dish. of course that's not the case, but that's what it seems like.  the yang chow here paired well with everything.  if you have a big group, and a bunch of orders, you simply have to get this too.  (9.5 / 10).  Assorted Seafood Over Pan-Fried Noodles. ($10.95).  crispy noodles with seafood was also good. the texture of the noodles as it softened in the sauce had a good chew to it. and so it had that firm, chewy, \"stretchy\" texture that goes well with all the accompaniments. there were shrimp, broccoli, scallops, squid, carrots, just a satisfying dish all throughout.  (9 / 10)  deep fried fresh squid with spicy salt. ($9.95).  every person has that old reliable dish. that dish that one orders all that time in certain restaurants. a dish that somehow serves as one's barometer in measuring which restaurant is better, even though you can't tell a restaurant's quality just based on one dish. but you do measure it through that one dish anyway.  to me that dish is salt and pepper squid.  me and tiffany almost always order this when we are in siam cafe. and today was no exception.  the squid was soft and very tender, but cooked throughout, which meant that it was fried with precision. the surface was crisp, but light, indicating that each piece had just the right amount of flour.  could be paired with simple steamed white rice, or any noodle dish. for weekday work lunches me and tiffany would sometimes order this and chicken curry noodle, and we're good to go.  if anything i just wish they included the tentacles, as they usually serve in other chinese restaurants. but i understand they're in cleveland, and tentacles may freak out other folks.  still good nevertheless.  (9.5 / 10).  steamed tilapia with soy, ginger, and scallion. ($ market price).  this is also one of those safety dishes.  usually more expensive than other chinese dishes, but this adds some balance to most of the rich, fried dishes in a family-style meal. the tilapia was steamed perfectly, cooked throughout, yet it retained the proper firmness of the flesh, still tender. i love the fried ginger that comes with it, as well as the scallions. it was served whole, and i personally love the tilapia belly and head.  one of my favorite chinese dishes, certainly one of my favorites in siam cafe.  (9.5 / 10).  roast duck, half order. ($10.95).  roast duck is roast duck. you really can't go wrong. here it was good, doesn't wow, but not bad either. it was a special occasion, with tiffany's birthday, and i just did not want to go chicken. so we had duck.  i would've preferred fried duck, with its crispy skin, a la peking duck or even the crispy duck at charm thai, but this was fine anyway. one thing with roasted duck is that sometimes the meat can be tough, if its even a tad overcooked.  here it was spot on, the meat was very tender.  (8 / 10).  beef tenderloin with black pepper sauce. ($13.95).  i wanted to have a beef dish just to have some balance with our meal. we had squid, fish, duck, rice, noodles, veg, so it was logical to include a beef dish. and so we ordered this too.  unfortunately if i had to rank everything we ordered, this would fall right at the bottom.  sauteed spinach with garlic. ($7.95).  we always order sauteed spinach when there are a bunch of us eating. the dish acts as a stabilizer, an excuse for eating all that other greasy stuff.  e spinach was cooked perfectly. the bright green color showed that it wasn't overcooked, and the crunch showcased its freshness. the garlic was not overpowering, and provided a good balance with the vegetable. this was a great \"in-between\" \"side-dish\",  we love siam cafe."}
{"text":"I know, the menu is HUGE, right? They can't possibly specialize in so many different kinds of cuisine. Somehow they manage it all, perfectly.   To other reviewers that have talked about this location or other restaurants in the Asia Town area, this isn't the ghetto. Isn't just east of downtown with a lot of lofts, art buildings, printing/industrial buildings, and a nice racial diversity. Ok, anyways...  I live for Siam. Everything here is amazing. i don't order anything that the mall food court offers, because frankly, they are going to cater to that American suburbian palate. Pad thai, Pla Red Pik, Green Curry, Crab, Short Ribs, Beef Tenderloin, I could go on and on. I've been eating here for years and I will never eat my way through the entire menu.   I will also say that I know that Superior Pho gets all the attention for a bowl of pho in Cleveland, but I think that Siam Cafe has, what could be the best bowl of pho in the area. One sip of that wonderful broth and I think that you might be converted."}
{"text":"Siam is one of my favorite restaurants, I have been coming here for years. The service is always friendly and consistent, even during the peak lunch and dinner hours. For those who are unfamiliar with this establishment I would suggest (1) the pla red pik, which is grouper, pan fried with bell peppers and onions in basil sauce (2) stir fried shrimp in the yellow coconut curry sauce which includes eggplant (3) curry rice which has raisins and onions,  and for desert the coconut or mango shake.   Any dish at Siam's is a win so enjoy!"}
{"text":"on par with cleveland asian cuisine.  rather bland seasoning. fine place for brunch/lunch. pad thai was sweet/sour not spicy as it traditionally should be."}
{"text":"One of the greatest authentic Chinese restaurants I have been to so far in Cleveland. Nothing beats the great price and food on the menu and the amount of food you actually get. I would recommend Beef Chow Fun, Peking Duck, Fried Rice of any kind and also spring rolls.   Owner is very friendly and helpful, I go here quite a lot and most often order beef chow fun since it is my favorite dish and trust me it is a very large serving for only around $8.95 or close to that price.   I will visit over and over again when I feel like eating Chinese food, the place is much cleaner, friendlier and brighter than Bo Loong which is across the street and the owners actually care about their customers, whenever I go to Bo Loong I feel like the owners are very ill mannered and don't care about their non Asian customers."}
{"text":"I am hoping I can come back here and have a better experience next time.  My boyfriend and I visited on New Years day.  It was kind of busy but not packed or anything.  Our server was friendly, and got our drink and food order pretty quickly.  I ordered well done beef soup.  It is pho with well done meat.  I also ordered pea shoots.  My boyfriend ordered soup to start and a short ribs dish.  He thought his food was some of the best.  I was not impressed.  My pho was very greasy and salty, and the beef was really fatty.  I like lean beef in my pho.  My pea shoots didn't arrive until well after I was finished with my pho.  I consider that to be a side dish, not dessert.  I wanted to try bubble tea, but after waiting a really long time to speak to our waitress, she brought our check without asking if we wanted any dessert or anything else.  I know my boyfriend is going to drag me back here because he liked it.  Maybe I will get a more attentive server and find something I like."}
{"text":"Best place for chinese food when in Cleveland.  Friendly staff. Get the dinner deal for 4 for only $62.  It has 7 dishes and includes rice, chicken, pork, beef, vegetables, shrimp and even a dessert. What a bargain!  That would have cost over $100 in LA"}
{"text":"Excellent food and extensive menu. They have a full bar offering. The host and staff were welcoming, courteous and prompt.  From the conversations overheard, this place has a lot of regular customers.   The location is industrial, but their is ample parking in the lot. It's about 1 mile south of downtown, a couple of blocks west of lakeshore drive.  Siam Cafe was an excellent choice while we were in town."}
{"text":"I love this place. I just moved into the area and Siam cafe has become my go to!   Portions are excellent, staff is very friendly, food is really rather good!   I've gotten take out and dined in several times, each experience has been without a single issue.   Drinks selection is nothing to write home about, but the food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"I always enjoy a trip to Siam Cafe! Although I tend to typically move towards \"Americanized\" Chinese food, I am blessed enough to have an abundance of Chinese and Taiwanese friends who have recommended some great dishes at Siam. The authentic dishes and the Americanized ones are all delicious, and the waitstaff is very attentive. I recommend the cocktails as well - great blends and really affordable!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Cleveland!  I like to come here for dinner with a group of people because the serving sizes are pretty big- we normally put everything in the middle and share.   They have a huge menu so it's not hard to find something for everyone."}
{"text":"Fresh, authentic, delicious --- the best Asian food in the area. We live on the Westside and drive here because it's worth it! So many choices and amazing value --- you'll most likely take home leftovers. Do yourself a favor and try the Crispy, Salty Squid---it's crunchy calamari in the simplest form. So good! Pad Thai, Steak Kew are also tasty!"}
{"text":"MAJOR SANITATION ISSUE, BAD ATTITUDE, TERRIBLE SERVICE  Went to Siam Cafe and got their signature spicy beef pho noodle.  First the noodle came with half of the soup being heavy red oil, which the waitress had no clue what to do about.  Had to ask 2 different people to get more soup added.  The worst thing happened when upon close to finishing, we found a GIANT DEAD FLY inside the soup noodle. Completed disgusted, I notified the waitress, who just said \"well that's embarrassing\" and took it back.    Not only did no one come by to apologize but the Manager/Hostess came by only because our waiter couldn't figure out how to split our bill.  NOT ONLY DID SHE NOT APOLOGIZE, she blamed us for the bill issue and when we brought up the fly, she brushed us off with annoyance and said well we took it off the bill, okay?   The sanitation is EXTREMELY QUESTIONABLE and worse, the attitude toward customers is ABOMINABLE. Our family will not be coming back and I hope you won't either. People who run establishments like this do not deserve business. I would give no stars but that's not an option."}
{"text":"I got carryout from here last week after reading all the good reviews on Yelp. Very unimpressed. I don't know, maybe I got the wrong thing. I decided to go with something pretty simple, chicken lo mein. I thought, chicken and noodles, how could that be bad.   In short, way too greasy, very bland tasting chicken, soggy vegetables, noodles clumped together in one big mass. It was somewhat palatable, but not enough for me to finish the dish. The one upside was that it was a very generous serving.  Perhaps I will go back someday and try something different on the menu. After all, I don't claim to be an expert on Chinese and Asian cuisine. It is quite probable that I just the wrong thing here. For now, though, I will have to try out some of the other Chinese restaurants in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Completely amazing. I'm not Asian, but Siam Cafe makes me wish I was!  The Pan Fried Noodles (well-done) with Pork and Vegetables are probably best thing I have ever eaten in my life.  I am kind of obsessed.  Also, their green tea is like crack to me.  The service is really good - everyone is very friendly and the wait staff work together to ensure you have everything that you need.  They box up leftovers in appropriate sized containers and wrap them with plastic bags with smiley faces on them.  So cute.   You know it's fresh:  The live fish, crabs, and eel are on display in large aquariums in the back of the restaurant.  If you want delicious Chinese food (that consists of more than just General Tso and fried rice delivered to your door), Siam Cafe is probably your best bet. And, you'll be surrounded by a lot of Asian families and students, which makes the experience feel more authentic."}
{"text":"Yeah. Meh. Dined here over the holidays and was not impressed.  Food was ok once they reheated it after serving it to us cold. Service was bad and we only saw our waitress once. They stuck us in a booth in the corner - it was cold, dark and dirty with a bug on the table. Owner was kind of flippant about the whole thing. Sweet lady at front gave me two nice desserts on my way out. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????80???????????"}
{"text":"I love Chinese food and here is \"real\" Chinese taste not \"American\" Chinese. If you like Chinese food you definitely should try here!!"}
{"text":"Average cuisine similar to what you'd find in a strip mall restaurant. Lunch meal for both me and wife was bland. Even spring roll was bland and small. Not impressed at all. Go across the street to Bo Lang for dim sum and flavorful food. I'm not sure where the great reviews are coming from for this place? Maybe I was there on a bad day?"}
{"text":"$55 for 4 plates.  ong choi-no flavor and yucky, lots of quantity  mabo tofu-whoever made this that night really screwed up because it tasted like burnt tofu and smoked sauce wtf.  seafood double pan fried noodles- seafood had too strong of a taste and sauce flavor was lacking, so i added lots of sriracha  sea bass-this was probably the best dish there, but the sauce it came with was relatively weak.  entrees included rice and dessert. service was pretty poor, too many people too little servers. however this place was pretty crowded and they have vietnamese and thai dishes, so its not really \"chinese\" even though the servers and owner were; and if it was, it would be the absolute worst ive had in my whole life, but perhaps by poor chance we just ordered the wrong things. but those things are what i always get and i must have high expectations being from CA  order with caution."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best places to get Chinese cuisine in Cleveland. My boyfriend and I recently visited for the celebration of the Chinese New Year and we were blown away by the flavors of the food here. We ordered a pot of Green Tea, Shrimp Wonton soup, Beef Short Rib with Pepper sauce (my new favorite Asian dish) and a dish with scallops and tons of vegetable (I can't remember the name of the dish). For the most part everything is homemade here and you can tell! the menu is large and we had a hard time deciding. The only thing we regret is that we did not take part in the special Chinese New Year menu and when a neighboring table got the duck we wished we had room for more food."}
{"text":"It was a very pleasant surprise to find this place through some chinese friends I work with. They were very happy that we could not a chance to eat at  a local american buffet!  It is actually a very decent place for being so far away from downtown. And they were full at lunch time. I had ordered some vegetarian food and it was delicious. The wait staff was very delightful and attentive. It was one of the best chinese food I had in long time.   I am sure I am going to make many more trips to this place in the future looking for the delicious food."}
{"text":"The BEST place in Cleveland for authentic Cantonese food! I moved away years ago but still crave their stuffed tofu! Every time I am in town, I make a point of eating here."}
{"text":"How does this restaurant have a 4 star rating???? This food is unbelievably bland and tasteless!  This is among the worst Chinese food I have ever had.  The dumplings were doughy and tasteless.  The wonton soup was hot broth and dough.  The Gen Tso chicken was raw and tasteless.    Avoid this restaurant at all cost!"}
{"text":"I visited Cleveland for graduation today and we stopped by for graduation dinner here. The food today was just OK. The boneless wings were delicious. The sauce that comes with it is great. This soup that we got was very bland and then I added too much vinegar. We ordered so much food that I don't even know what all I ate. I do remember that the beef chow fun which is usually one of my favorite dishes was very tasteless. I really enjoyed the duck. However the lobster that we ordered you could tell that one was dead when it was cooked. The flavor and texture was just different compared to the live lobsters. The service was great and the staff was really nice. We came in at just the right time so that they did not have a dinner rush yet so our party of eight was seated quickly."}
{"text":"Went there for an early dinner on a weeknight. Stepped in and nobody to seat us, never a good sign. Poor service throughout the night. What is up with bringing appetizers and entrees in at all staggered times? They are aiming to be a bit more upscale and that does not cut it.  The food was decent, we both got short rib type dishes which were nearly identical, generous portions of meat with some vegetable, mainly onions, all well seasoned at least. Not the best, nothing to really make me go wow, just somewhat fancier short ribs. I had heard so many exciting things about this place so the experience was underwhelming."}
{"text":"I have come to Siam Cafe off and on over the last 14 years. I enjoy it. I'm not a food expert, much less an Asian food expert, but I like the food here. I also like that I see a lot of Asian people eating here. And I've seen Fred Griffith here, and Dennis Kucinich.  They have many different kinds of food, from several regions of Asia. They also have \"weird\" Asian food, like jellyfish and live frog, which I have never tried. I seriously doubt I could eat a live frog, or even a dead one that I killed. I enjoy several dishes including Bun Bo Chao (sp) and Stir-Fried Beef with Vermicelli. I also like the Stuffed Chicken Wings, Spring Rolls and Fried Rice.  The service here is almost always great, but occasionally inconsistent. I had once been away for a year and the head waiter remembered me and what I had eaten the last time I was there. He is really excellent. Also, they are open late which is a plus.  Overall, I enjoy the service and the food. That is what makes a good restaurant in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is top shelf. Nothing fancy, just great food and service."}
{"text":"Best Asian cuisine in the city! You have got to try the stuffed chicken wings.  It seems to defy the laws of physics, the way they hold together. You will feel like you are in that KFC commercial- \"I ate the bones!\" Also, the ginger tea rocks!!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food here. It is mainly Asian, limited Thai options but a very wide and interesting menu. Wonderful non vegetarian dishes and good but not as many vegetarian options. Loved their bubble tea. The location is not the best but the restraint itself is warm and inviting. The owner and the staff are very kind and welcoming. Very reasonably priced and nice for a casual dinner outside or for carry out."}
{"text":"Big Chinese restaurant with good seating for bigger parties. They have a HUGE Menu with Chinese and Vietnamese dishes. Do try their pho, as it compares to Vietnamese pho from a Vietnamese restaurant. There's also a wide selection of nice beers :) upon entering you can see, if you look at the wall, live crabs and lobsters in tanks. Many of them! Food was great here! I will definitely return to try some fresh seafood when I have time :) I ordered during their closing time, yet no one rushed me out. Even though I was enjoying my nice cold beer inside..not noticing the time that had passed by so quickly :)"}
{"text":"I ate out there a couple of times with friends and family. The dishes there are good, but not excellent in taste. I'd say that most of the dishes here are on the Americanized side because the Asian American Communities are on the small side. I guess this is what you would expect when you go to an Asian Resturant in Cleveland, Ohio."}
{"text":"Hands down the best authentic asian cuisine in Cleveland.  The food is great every time I go and it never get's tiring.  Coming from a traditional asian family I'm  not a fan of asian fusion, or \"americanized\" asian food so when I say this is some of the best authentic asian food in Ohio I mean it!  Staff is always friendly and their prices are reasonable.  Holidays and weekends they're packed so it may be a wait time to get a table but what can you expect from such a great restaurant?  Other than that there's nothing negative I can say about this place.  Hold on, actually there is...parking.  Like previously stated they're quite busy these days so parking is also somewhat difficult to find at times but they deserve every star I gave them!  Keep up the great food!"}
{"text":"Siam is paradise to me. I never bother to flip through their encyclopedia menu because I've been ordering exactly what my Chinese friends ordered during my very first visit in 2007. When I walk through Siam's doors, it's very routine: I'm greeted and promptly seated. I tell the server that I do not need a menu and would like to order the mayonnaise shrimp with candied walnuts, chicken/shrimp pad thai, and sesame chicken. In no more than 15 minutes, all three dishes are sitting piping hot before me.   Let's start with my absolute favorite dish: mayonnaise shrimp with candied walnuts (it's funny how so many people are turned off by the simple fact that there's \"mayonnaise;\" you'll be absolutely shocked at how off your judgmental assumption was). About eight or so jumbo shrimp are perfectly fried, tossed in a tangy, creamy, and exotic mayonnaise-based sauce, laid on a bed of broccoli, and then topped with walnuts that have been cooked in sugar. It comes with a complimentary bowl of steamed white rice. I tried a popular recipe for this dish at home last week and it embarrassingly paled in comparison. This is one of their more expensive offerings ($15) but it is worth every cent considering its taste and the market-price of jumbo shrimp. It's always on my mind, and yes--I've accepted the fact that I'm an addict.  The pad thai is around 10 bucks and you get a very generous portion. I've never had it better anywhere else than at Siam. With some fresh lime, peanuts, and sriracha, you're in for one hell of a tasty treat. Same goes for the sesame chicken ($10)--chunky, crispy hunks of fried boneless chicken covered in a sweet, rich sauce and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds.   This place is always busy and full, but I somehow manage to wait for only about a minute to get a table. The servers are polite, hospitable, and clean. The venue is also clean, authentically decorated, and comfortable. The massive fish and lobster tanks add on to the great ambiance. Food, service, and big portions have been consistent for the 5 years that I've been here and I'll continue to be a Siam regular for a VERY long time!"}
{"text":"Wow, what can I say about this place that hasn't already been said. I literally drive to Cleveland just to eat here. First, I love how there's a blend of authentic dishes from several aspects of Eastern Asia. The fresh fried squid is absolutely amazing. Light and not overly greasy...perfectly crispy. There are amazing tofu casseroles, as well. I've tried the spicy black pepper sauce beef short ribs, which are amazing. The noodle dishes are spectacular. I usually don't get fried rice dishes, but the Thai fried rice was light yet had great flavor. I could go on and on, but you can't go wrong with any dish on the menu."}
{"text":"Around 5 years ago when I was growing up in a nearby suburb of Cleveland, this was one of my favorite Chinese Restaurants in the area. Lots of great, authentic food for the area, and always fun to visit when your family's in town. Classic."}
{"text":"Another disappointing Chinese restaurant in Cleveland.  We ordered 3 dishes and 1 beef noodle soup.  The noodle resembles instant noodle, and my husband who usually loves the noodle soup ate less than half.  Thai basil ground chicken is the most flavorful dish, but surely salty.  The Japanese egg tofu tastes ok.  The worse dish is the eggplant pot and seafood/fish in the dish is NOT fresh and tastes gross.  The service was so slow.  All the dishes were brought in different time, and we had to wait long time between dishes."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Asian restaurants in Cleveland. A pretty aggressive menu and while not fully authentic certainly not a suburban strip mall Asian spot. Portions are large and reasonably priced. Dishes are  perfect for sharing. Decor needs to be updated but I guess that and the location keep the prices down. Just don't expect a fancy joint. I have been to Siam's countless times and have never been disappointed. My favorite dishes are the Baby Bok Choy, Cumin Lamb, duck choo Chee and ground basil chicken. Tried the Bubble Tea yesterday for the first time which was some of the best I have had! This place always has a decent crowd no matter the time or date and is worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Oh wow, I couldn't BELIEVE there was a Thai place this good in Cleveland.   They have quality food and pile on the fresh ingredients. The texture and seasonings were spot on. The House fried rice with pineapple is absolutely SUPERB. My fiance finally found a Tom Young Goong that stood up to being categorized as his favorite dish. It's a shame I only ate here three times before moving back to Seattle. I MISS IT!"}
{"text":"Had flounder not fried coz theres 2 kinds and requested w vegetables (twas pretty good!) :) will def come back."}
{"text":"This place is great if you go with a large party (5+) and want to share a bunch of tasty dishers.  Definately some of the best asian food you'll get in Cleveland.  Price is good for the portions."}
{"text":"I'll tell you why the low rating. When you go to a restaurant like this you want a complete experience, that means your food and the atmosphere as well as the service. This place has great food, no doubt about that, but man do they lack in the area of service, not only lack, they don't have a clue.  Every time I've been there they've treated me like I was invisible, and that I was  a complete inconvenience showing up there to eat. I surely hope it's not because I happen to not be Asian, but that is the feeling I'm starting to get because I don't notice this behavior and lack of service with the Asian customers I am dining with. If that's the case, then it's a very sad commentary on this restaurant. We ordered some simple lunches today, and after taking our order our waitress vanished and the only time she returned was to drop off our drinks to us after we had started our meal, and NEVER bothered to inquire if we wanted a refill, how our food was, nothing, simply vanished. Then when she returned with the check and asked us if everything was okay, I told her they weren't, that it would have been nice to see her once or twice after the food had been served and her reply to me was that she was busy with other customers. This is the main reason I feel as if we're not welcomed here because we're not Asian because about 95% of the customers were Asian, so what does that tell me, that she was busy with other customers.  Oh well, it's a shame because like I said, they do have good food, but they simply don't get the fact that dining is more than just taking an order, throwing a plate on the table and collecting money."}
{"text":"Consistently good food. Atmosphere is much to be desired - little plain, neighborhood not great, but the food is always good, large portions, flavorful, fresh/hot. Favorite is the Pad Thai. Moved away from the area about 13 years ago, and return to see family annually, so I am always comparing Pad Thai to other restaurants, and none can compare. Great noodles, right proportion of eggs, scallion, shrimp, chicken, nuts and sauce. Beijing Pork Chop is another great choice, sort of sweet and sour dish, but pork on segments of bone. Fried pork twisted and holds sauce well, better than nugget dishes.   Siam Cafe is a great choice in Cleveland, and competes well if not better w/ similar places we have tried in New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts."}
{"text":"We seated in the table waiting over 20 minits without anyone take our order even without a glass of water very bad service"}
{"text":"This place is very delicious and extremely authentic. I always get the thai eggplant everytime I'm in. There's shrimp, minced meat and eggplant. So delicious!   But my favorite thing in the place is the free dessert taro soup that they bring out at the end of the meal! Be sure to ask them for it if they don't bring it immediately. It's the perfect bit of sweetness for after dinner.  The service is very good and you can come with a lot of people even on short notice. The prices are fair and the portions are large. The waiters are always very considerate to check if you need anything. I suppose speaking Chinese may help you with your transaction, but in general, they are very good.   Definitely a go to place (but beware if you're intolerant of MSG...there's definitely some lurking in some of the dishes)."}
{"text":"Any place that serves bubble tea is alright in my book! This is one of the very few places in Cleveland that serves bubble tea (also called boba as my west coast friends remind me). If you've never had bubble tea, you don't know what your missing, unless of course your one of those people that aren't big into textured things. Essentially bubble tea is a creamy, beverage with black tapioca balls (or pearls) resting on the bottom. Think melted milkshake type flavor with flavors ranging from coconut to almond tea to taro, which is my personal favorite.  As for the food, Siam has the best pad thai in Cleveland hands down. I haven't had Pad Thai this good since my travels to Thailand several years ago. It is an absolute must to squeeze the fresh lime wedge onto the dish, which compliments the flavors perfectly. I have also tried the Chicken Summer Roll and Veggie Summer Rolls which are both flavorful and fresh and make for a tasty light appetizer and the dipping sauce is delish. The menu is quite extensive and has many different options to suit everyone from the carnivore to the vegetarian.   The service is usually excellent although if you go on a day in which they have a full house it seems as though sometimes you get lost in the mix. The ambiance is quite different from other Thai restaurants I've been to with minimal being the name of the game here. They have a fish tank and thankfully, I've yet to witness them trying to catch someone's meal!  And don't forget to try the bubble tea!"}
{"text":"Siam cafe's decor is looking a bit long in the tooth... the architecture is from an era past, and the colours are a tad weary.  On the way in to meet a friend, I did hear a pair speaking in Japanese.  I almost turned around to ask them where they were from... but decided against it.  (Yes, there are really _that_ few japanese in CLE)  Instead, I decided to sit down with my friend John and try the place out.    The menu selection is largely cantonese.  There's a tiny bit of Thai and moderate amount of Vietnamese.  My guess is that the founders are Viet-Chinese.  Who owns/runs the place now is beyond me.  We had Mapo Tofu (I\"ve been craving food from North of Guangzhou since coming back to the 'States), a Tendinous beef steam-pot thingee, and a vietnamese style pork cutlets.  The Vietnamese Pork was the highlight getting a 4 from me.  Texture could have been a bit better, and the salt factor was just a tad high... but the taste was good -- especially spruced up with a bit of Sriracha.  The Tendinous Beef and tofu skin pot was also pretty good 3-4.  Texture good, flavour deep yet mellow.    Rice was adequate, nothing stunning, but good consistency.  They served ice water, no tea.  That kindov hurt.  The Mapo tofu was not what I wanted.  I'd actually asked the waitress if the cooks were southerners (Chinese), and she said yes.  I turned to my friend and said that I didn't want Mapo tofu if they were cantonese... My experience is that Canto interpretation of Mapo tofu is typically off.  I commented also that their use of peppercorn typically left a lot to be desired.  We got it anyway because the waitress assured us that it was alright.    I'm not ever getting it again. :/ Numerous peppercorns of 0 potency do not make for numbing-tufu.  Mapo tofu needs to NUMB THE TONGUE!  The confucian concept of the Rectification of Names demands it!  Instead, the numerous emasculated peppercorns merely clutter the sauce with bits of rigidity that add nothing to flavour, and everything to inedibility.  Sigh.  Despite my intensely negative reaction to the tofu, the other fare wasn't nearly so poorly received.  In due time, perhaps I'll sample more of their work... in the mean time, I might venture elsewhere..."}
{"text":"Review update. I think that since I last reviewed siam, there are plenty of other great Chinese food options in Cleveland, or even Asiatown. It's still a decent go-to, especially for huge groups of people, but we have been frequenting it less and less.   Their banquet menu really is a steal though. Ask for the \"family dinners\" if you have a group of 8-10. We usually go with the family dinner for 6. If you have 8-10 people, it comes down to $10-12/person. In addition to the family dinner, I would order the pork hock (in the pictures) because it is so tender and flavorful. It's a dish unique to the other Chinese restaurants here (I think) and that's the one thing I would definitely come for in the future."}
{"text":"great place for authentic Chinese food! The price is good too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here sporadically over several years.  While the food here is very good, the decor is indeed \"long in the tooth\" and the service is dysfunctional, making me question whether we will ever return.  When a table of four and another table of eight are seated after you but exit  long before you do, in spite of mentioning the lack of service to the manager, something is very wrong.  If the food hadn't been brought to the table by runners it's hard to say how long it would have taken to get it.  Unfortunately, this is not our first experience with poor service here and the good food just can't make up for this bad experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food. My favorite is their spicy ground basil chicken. Their food is prepared so fast, so you don't have to wait too long even on a busy night."}
{"text":"Good lunch place.   Soup and salads.    The service is prompt, staff is very courteous and the place is immaculate."}
{"text":"My favorite Asian restaurant. It's not \"cheap Chinese\" or Americanize Asian, unless you need Americanized Asian. I love the vast menu to please everyone. I usually get take out. The asparagus and tofu is my favorite, I ask for it extra spicy and the chefs are great at adding spice to the dish. Take out is always fast and hot. The parking is a large lot."}
{"text":"Expected this place to be great based on the reviews. It is very possible that I ordered the wrong thing. The waiter I had was very aloof. He was looking over my head while I ordered.  I asked for Thai hot and what I got was fairly bland. I would of asked for some chili oil but I didn't see him again until I got the check a half hour later. I guess someone dining alone is ignored if you aren't a regular."}
{"text":"Yelp won't leave me alone until I write this review. (Back up off me, Yelp!)  First, I'll say this. The only reason we went to Siam Cafe was because Wonton BBQ was closed. Sorry, truth. BUT!!!!!.... I'm not sad about it. Siam was very good.  My family and I were the only non-Asians in the whole place. Very good sign.   The menu is overwhelming. One of the only things I didn't like, but that's to be expected at a place that offers so many different types of authentic Asian noms.   Everything was supremely fresh. They even have fish in tanks that you'll later see on your plate! Tons of fish. Lobsters and frogs, too. Oh, I'm sorry. Did that make you squeamish? Muahahaha! Too bad.   Portions are out of control huge. I went with four family members and we all ordered an entree and had boxes and boxes of leftovers to take home. Plus, we got a few appetizers and soups, too. We're all fat but that was way too much even for us chubbies.   Service was wonderful. They really catered to my bratty child and brought out his pho almost right away. And they didn't mind that he insisted on standing by the fish tanks for a big chunk of the time we were there.   I'm trying to get back soon to try more of their rotund menu."}
{"text":"This is quite a nice Thai restaurant that appears to be run by Chinese. We had chicken curry noodle, pho & stuffed chicken wings. All were very good, as was the service. Ambiance was okay."}
{"text":"It's really hard to give this place 4stars review. My friend referred me here so we decided to try it. Came at the night time which was not crowded,but the service is not really good as what I'm expected. Not only the service but also the food was little be flavorless. The string beans were little bit old. The squid was kind of hard. Would try other Chinese restaurant with the comparable price."}
{"text":"I was impressed by this place! Looks like it's in the middle of nowhere but very nice inside and seemed to be a crown of mostly non-Asian diners, which made the place less intimidating. The service was great, they have a big menu and the server took the time to answer all our questions. You're able to get things not spicy if you want. The food literally came out in 5 minutes and the portions were huge! I wish it was a little hotter though, it was just kind of warm, but it was delicious!  I got the chicken Vermicelli and added snow peas and my sister got the ginger beef over rice and added broccoli. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nothing special at all. Much better options elsewhere."}
{"text":"Siam is one of the few from scratch restaurants around anymore. Their food is always good. A little bit on the expensive side but worth the cost. I worked in the area for many years and definitely got lunch there several times a month."}
{"text":"I really wish I could figure out how this restaurant gets such good reviews.  But what completely flips my french fries is the huge number of Asians who frequent Siam Cafe!  Every time I go in there it's packed with Asians!  In any other situation, this would be a Very Good Thing.  Here, I can't figure it out, unless they get served something different from the rest of us.  Anyway, on with the review...  I've been to Siam Cafe three times over the past 3 years.  The first time my wife and I went to try it.  Didn't like it.  Vowed not to go back.  About a year later some friends of ours invited us to the \"best Asian restaurant in Cleveland\".  They raved about it.  When we arrived and realized it was Siam Cafe we were disappointed, but figured we'd give it another shot...maybe we just caught them on a bad day.  Another substandard meal.  The food is on par with what you'd get at one of those \"picture-on-the-wall places in a strip center, you know, sandwiched between the Subway and the dry cleaner.  Our friends were from Paynesville so we figured they probably didn't get out much...  Fast forward to a week ago.  A coworker asked me if I liked Asian food.  When I said yes, he offered me a gift certificate for some \"restaurant on the east side\".  It was about to expire after it sat in his desk drawer for a year, so he offered it to me.  Imagine my dismay to see \"Siam Cafe\" on it.    Driving out from the far west side, my wife and I actually discussed tossing the certificate in the trash and going to nearby Wonton Gourmet instead (where we've eaten once and which totally rocked our world), THAT'S how much we don't like Siam Cafe....we were ready to bin a FREE PAIR OF DINNERS there and PAY to eat someplace else.  However, our native frugality betrayed us and we found ourselves sitting in Siam Cafe.  The previous times we've been there we ordered some average Asian staples...Tom Ka soup (tasted like coconut-flavored water), Kung Pao chicken (no spice at all and not much in the way of flavor, either), etc.  This time my wife ordered ground basil chicken and Tom Yum soup.    Her soup and ground basil chicken arrived at the same time.  Great, so she can watch her entree get cold while she eats her appetizer?  She asked the waitress for something to cover up her entree while she ate her appetizer and after many blank looks, received a pan lid.  Since none of my stuff was on the table yet, I snuck a forkful of her ground basil chicken, which looked pretty good.  What the hell?  It didn't taste like basil OR chicken.  The closest I can approximate is that it tasted like....turkey sausage.  Poorly made turkey sausage, at that.  Hardly any flavor at all.  I asked how her Tom Yum soup was, and she said it was meh, so no change there.  My food arrived.  I ordered something based entirely on a picture in the menu.  I couldn't even tell what it was, it just LOOKED amazing.  It turned out to be flounder with green onions and lots and lots of chili peppers.  On the menu it actually had three chili's next to it (all the other hot entrees had ONE).  It was almost a soup....it had about the same ratio of stuff to liquid that pho would have, except this was supposed to be eaten over rice.  I dug in.  This is going to sound really bizarre, but bear with me....after 4-5 mouthfuls, this stuff started giving me the weirdest sensations.  My lips and tongue felt like they were....BUZZING!  I told my wife it felt like I had millions of tiny ants crawling around on my lips!  To clarify, it wasn't HOT (spicy).  I mean, there was a little heat there, but I like insanely hot food.  My lips weren't burning, they were HUMMING!  And the flavor?  My taste buds were completely overpowered...it was like I'd bitten into a giant chili-flavored boullion cube!  I'd drink some water to wash the taste out and as soon as I put the first forkful back in my mouth I'd get the same sensations.  Now, the flavor wasn't....bad.  It was just impossible to eat, in the same way chewing a handful boullion cubes would be.  I mean, I like the flavor of beef, but I couldn't chew up and swallow a jar of boullion cubes, you know?  I don't know if it was insanely salty or what, but I gave up after maybe a third of it.  (We took it home and the next day threw the leftovers in 5 cups of white rice we made, and it was STILL too salty.  I poured out all the liquid and ate what was left and it was actually not bad).  Atmosphere?  We sat next to an emergency exit, which was opened 5-6 times during our stay; it was 30F outside, which was pleasant.  I saw they had a guest wifi so I asked for the password.  \"So sorry, manager not give us the password.\"  So, never again.  Even IF someone gives us a free gift certicate."}
{"text":"Ordered emperors chicken, my wife chose the cashew chicken. Both were very good. The service was awful, waited to place the order, the spring tools arrived reasonably fast the meals not so much. We waited over a half hour for the cashew chicken and over 50 minutes for the emperor chicken. We split the cashew chicken, and we're finished by the time the emperor chicken arrived. Then we waited for the check, which we paid promptly, but the waitress decided to have a rather long conversation at the register, I had to go get the check to sign it after 15 minutes,"}
{"text":"this place is as authentic as it comes! my family is chinese and wherever they go on vacation, they look for chinese food to eat. like why even go on vacation? just move to chinatown nyc or something geez. so my parents came to visit and i took them here and they loved it. i knew they'd like it but man they loved it. we got fried noodles with bean sprouts, mapo tofu, braised tofu with snow peas, and bak choy. all delicious, light without being bland. i live here so i eat in or get take out here every week. the braised tofu is my regular. it's pretty perfect as far as tofu goes. fried outside and silky on the inside with plenty of delicious sauce. i stopped by for take out on christmas night, of course because it was one of two restaurants in the whole city that was open, the other one being boo long across the street, which is also delicious. it was packed! who knows, maybe it was all the jews, or the christians who didn't want honey baked ham, or just like me and my friends, dgaf about christmas. go here. eat well."}
{"text":"My all time favorite restaurant! My family has been coming to this restaurant for 20 years! We used to come just for the spring rolls, which are the best. I've had many different items from here and I've loved everything I've tasted.   I love the staff, they are attentive and cry friendly. They know my family and have watched my children grow up.   I would, and have recommend this place to everyone I know. People keep telling me about the restaurant across the street but every time I plan to try it I always go to Siam Cafe."}
{"text":"I'm confused why it's called Siam Cafe when the basis of their food is traditional Chinese fare. Anyway, my friends and I were on the hunt for a good late night Saturday spot and came here. We arrived at 11pm and ordered before the 11:30 kitchen cutoff time. 7 girls= 8 plates of heaping food with plenty of leftovers. We had: General Tao's chicken, sauteed water spinach, salted spicy seafood, salted spicy scallops, chicken pad thai, sizzling beef and peppers, shredded beef with basil, and shrimp with black bean sauce. It all came out pretty quickly. The service was friendly, quick, and efficient. The food was delicious. The ambiance was quiet (due to us coming in close to closing time). I would love to come here again the next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Hands down the best damn Pan-Asian food in all of Cleveland! I enjoy Asian cuisine and have tried many \"authentic\" restaurants around the country. I'd even venture to say that Siam ranks as one of the best in the nation. The place is not much for ambiance, but the food is GREAT! The variety is amazing! And everything is delicious. My family and I are frequent diners here and we know the staff well. I've tried just about everything on their menu and while I have my favorites, there is nothing that I haven't liked. The Pho is good, and if you aren't feeling too conscious about your health... try what I consider to be some Asian comfort food, which is anything fried. My favorites include the spicy salt-baked squid , shrimp or scallops."}
{"text":"Always a treat and a pleasant atmosphere.  Cuisine is amazing, and never disappoints.  Thanks for the hospitality and pleasurable experience.  Worth the drive every time!"}
{"text":"Every family has a go to dinner spot and this was mine growing up! We celebrated all birthdays, pre-wedding dinners, and sometimes even smaller holidays with dinner at Siam Cafe.   My favorite dish of all time is their Walnut Shrimp with Steamed Broccoli. Add a cup of white rice to it and voila, what a delicious meal! This dish was a staple to our extended family meals and it brings back so many memories!   It's a little further from the interstate, but definitely worth the drive! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Our family loves the extensive menu and number of healthy vegetarian options. It's casual dining and authentic Asian, a great place for families. Even more fun are the \"family dinners\" for large groups. Their Pad Thai and Bun Bo Xao are yummy!"}
{"text":"You can get Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese dishes at this Chinese run restaurant.  Pretty good for all the basic stuff."}
{"text":"One of Asia Town's best restaurants and a huge success for the neighborhood and for Cleveland. They have an eclectic mix of Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai and Cantonese Cuisine. I have had Pho soup here and it is delicious but have not seen it on the menu as of late. Menu ranges for Pad prik, Pad Thai, live lobster, seafood dishes, Thai basil to Szechuan chicken and Satay chicken or beef. All of it delicious. One of the best meals there is. Asian folks get a special menu different from the regular menu. Ask for it. Plenty of free parking, reasonable prices, clean, service is fair to good most days."}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience there with my family.   It was pretty packed on a weekend day for dinner, so we put in our order and waited 30 minutes patiently, expecting that to be a reasonable wait time. After 40 minutes, we asked them to check on our food, and our food had not arrived after almost an hour! We suspect that they forgot our order and put it in only when we asked them to check, although they did NOT admit this. What was worse was that when we confronted the waiter who had taken our order, he asked us, \"Do you know who took your order?\" WOW. No apology, no compensation, and not even an explanation was offered. After an hour, ONE out of four dishes we ordered came out with a vague promise that the others were on their way, so we just left, upset and frustrated. This is really unexcusable.   I've come here several times before, and while service is usually better than this experience, the food here is just NOT worth the wait. If you're craving Chinese, go to Wonton Gourmet or Szechuan Gourmet just down the road!!"}
{"text":"The pad Thai is a large amount for a small price, but it's not that good. It's not spicy, it has a lemon lime sweet sour taste. It's not disgusting, I just won't get it again. The Vietnamese spring rolls were awesome."}
{"text":"For fantastic authentic Chinese food in the Cleveland area, it's hard to beat Siam Cafe!  I've been enjoying the many dishes on their menu since they opened more than a dozen years ago, focusing more on the Chinese elements although they do serve some vietnamese and thai dishes also.  The restaurant has large tanks of fresh live seafood cooked to order and can prepare Asian specialty drinks like bubble tea.  Citing all the dishes I enjoy at Siam Cafe is like repeating most of their menu - but some favorites include crispy chicken, salt baked shrimp and squid,  Japanese tofu, egg plant with garlic sauce, double lobster, steamed whole fish, beef caserole, fried oysters, many delicious noodles, and lots of Chinese vegetables.  They do serve alcohol, but I usually get Thai iced tea, iced coffee with condensed milk, taro bubble tea, mango bubble tea... and the list goes on.  The restaurant is best enjoyed with large groups eating family style so multiple entres can be shared.  I have also gotten very large to-go party orders (~20 people) from Siam and they always do a great job with carry-out.  For those that are use to \"Americanized\" Chinese foods, they have that also -- but I highly recommend you try something more authentic or ask the friendly wait staff for recommendations.  Mmm... I'm ready to go there again!  :)"}
{"text":"This place is good overall. Most of the dishes are well cooked and well flavored. However, nothing here is particularly interesting or memorable. If you're looking for a decent meal, this is worth going to."}
{"text":"I was in town for Eater and my mom said she made a reservation here.  First of all I'm leery of Pan-Asian restaurants, and In Cleveland?!  But this place was fantastic.  My son and I split the chicken satay and I have to say it was the best I've ever had (even in Thailand).  It was perfect in every way.    Next I had the shrimp & scallops in black bean sauce hot plate, which comes to the table sizzling.  It said it was spicy, but it was not too spicy but was very tasty.  I also had the snow pea pod shoots with garlic which was great as well.  Everyone in my family enjoyed their dishes.  The manager/owner? dropped by our table a couple of time.  He's from Canton (China, not Ohio) and is quite funny and personable  All in all a great find!"}
{"text":"My favorite all purpose Asian restaurant to go to in the Cleveland area. It has a very large menu reasonably priced with a good of mix of Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese food. It is open 365 day a year and serving food late every night. When I bring people here for the first time it becomes one of there favorites instantly. Some of my favorites are the Siam Wings (stuffed chicken wings), Vietnamese Hot and Sour Shrimp Soup, Hot Basil Chicken, Beef Chow Fun, Lobster or Crab (Thai Style) and any of the vegetables or noodle soup dishes. Crab and fish, fresh out of the water tanks when you order them."}
{"text":"Siam Cafe? Are you kidding me??  I asked the concierge at my hotel for a good Thai restaurant in Cleveland. He said Siam Cafe. This is not a Thai restaurant, despite the name, it is a Hong Kong style restaurant with a few choices on the menu that allow them to call it Asian fusion. It is not. I saw a Pad Thai dish and Vietnamese spring rolls on the list. 95 percent of the items on this menu are basic Chinese cuisine items. No problem-I love Cantonese cuisine.   I ordered the beef brisket wonton noodle soup. Usually pretty basic fare at a place like this, even with the Thai moniker. This is what I got. The beef brisket consisted of big chunks of pure fat. Disgusting. I get that a lot of people prefer a bit of fat with their brisket, as it adds flavour. But this is what they served me. I took the 'brisket' out and put it on a separate dish so I could eat what was left. The waiter made no comment when he saw it, just handed me the bill. Awful."}
{"text":"Best Asian Restaurant in Cleveland. The wait staff is wonderful they are very polite and quick. The menu has a astonishing number of choices. The seafood is great. Everything is fresh and authentic. The bar service is equally vast. The owners are wonderful and genuinely concerned that you are having a great dining experience .Love this place"}
{"text":"I love this place.  GOOD: * Huge menu with a variety of traditional Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese-style food: the basil chicken (spicy-style) is one of my favorite dishes. * Big, raucous place with round tables, ideal for big groups * A diverse clientele, lots of families, large groups of local students * Lightning fast takeout (they prepared 4 dishes for me last night in 15 minutes) * Very reasonable prices (last night's meal of basic chicken, Singapore noodles, baby snow pea greens and Pad Thai was $37.00.  This fed four of us with plenty of leftovers.) * Friendly staff  BAD: * Well... parking is sometimes a little iffy when it gets busy on the weekends.  But there's plenty of street parking  Across the street is Bo Loong; head over there for karaoke after eating at Siam Cafe.  Just some advice - if you ask them to prepare a several course meal, be sure to specify that you'd like the food to be served over a period of time - otherwise, the food comes out all at once.  It's a little overwhelming."}
{"text":"Tom Yum was good, the jelly fish was ok, little rubbery. Pickled veggies were good. Pad Thai was very good , but wasn't impressed with the chicken cabbage salad. Would like to go back again and try something different."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed today with not only the quality of food, but the customer service that we received at this establishment. We come here very often. This used to be our favorite place in Cleveland. Unfortunately, today will be our last visit. We had INSECTS in our tea pot!!! The pot was full of them, and we noticed at the end of our meal when the bugs were swimming in our tea cups. If the INSECTS had not been swimming about we would have never known! When we opened the pot there were many! Not only is this disgusting, but the way it was handle was even more disappointing. The establishment decided to take the tea off our almost $80 bill (which we were made to pay anyway). This makes me wonder the cleanliness of their staff and the  kitchen where they store their food. I would NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"Far from tasty. I can forgive not authentic Chinese food but that's not even American Chinese food. Trust me any Chinese international student can cook better food than the chef here. We ordered two dishes and they were all over thickened with starch, it was like eating baby formula."}
{"text":"Was absolutely terrible food. I really want to love Siam Cafe as a few friends rave about it but the best meal here (4 so far) was mediocre at best.  I know it was St Pattys day and late (10-11pm) but the quality of the food was pretty much inedible. The flavoring in the pepper short ribs was pure strong pepper and paste but the \"meat\" was only rubbery, chewy fat/frizzle around a bone. The texture was beyond weird. The duck (red curry) coo chee's sauce was watered down to essentially no taste (running low late night and trying to make it last? Shame on you) and the duck tasted strong & slightly rancid (like over the expiration date poultry becomes).  I actually had to stop at BK bc I was still hungry, lol"}
{"text":"Don't go for ambiance, don't go for Thai food.  Order your typical americanized Chinese dish, enjoy the usually fast but impersonal service, and be glad that a city like the Cleve has an Asiatown in an area that is otherwise kinda ghetto. they have a big menu but this is simply not the kind of place I'm ordering seafood, despite the countless selections. And if you get bored at this place, head over to Payne Avenue's Wonton Gourmet for a change of pace and perhaps slightly more authentic fare (slightly).  My go-to \"Chinese\" restaurant."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite asian restaurant. Great variety of Chinese, asian, thai options. Always have fresh fish/seafood on hand. it pays to ask to order something not on their menu they'll always try and accommodate. Excellent service and always busy which says a lot. I've been coming here for years and 1 year on Christmas and they were packed. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, food, and quality. I've been eating here for the last 6 years and it's a great Chinese restaurant. -from a Chinese customer"}
{"text":"This is one of my Family's favorite places to go; Nestled on a corner deep within Cleveland's Asia Town. The food here is always excellent, even when ordering something unknown and new. It just always seems to be top notch.   I first knew this place was great when realizing there were more Asians here than any other ethnicity. That should tell you something about the authenticity of the food. Tables filled with families drinking, being loud and joyful.   The service is what you would expect in Asia Town, attentive and to the point. The food though, for me personally is quite exceptional. The seafood is always fresh which I appreciate, and they always keep the tea coming.  Nostalgia runs high for me personally at Siam Café, but I would never let that detour me from honesty. With that being said, this place is awesome on so many levels and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I have to drop the star level, the food has been a little off lately. The food is always good, but the last few times the service has been annoying. They forgot one of  my dishes and it seemed like an act of god to get some cilantro.  The soup we ordered was luke warm, leaving the shrimp partially cooked, it was brought back a bit warmer but not very spicy.when your nose is as stuffed as mine you need it really spicy."}
{"text":"This is a pretty popular Asian restaurant. I'm not sure what they identify as, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai?? I guess one of those all in ones that I'm not so much a fan of, because they do everything but nothing particularly well, at least in my opinion.  I hate going here but my family loves it, so I find myself here on birthdays and other special occasions. No matter how many times I come here, I can't find anything that I truly like. I mean I'll eat the food, but none of the dishes make me think when I'm at home, \"let's go to Siam, I'm craving _______\". Even when I'm there and ordering, nothing on the menu jumps out at me and I end up taking forever to make a decision. Show me a dish that is good there and I'll show you a nearby restaurant that does it better.  It's just unspectacularly average.  I guess if I had to highlight something it would be the water cress soup.  And the service. Almost always awesome and friendly. Except this one kid that gave me hard time for ordering sesame chicken. \"Come on, you're Asian, don't order the American stuff\". Like dude, I've had the other stuff and I wasn't a fan. Also, you could eat gourmet burgers every day and sometimes you still just want to throw shame aside and have a McDouble. Let me have my sesame chicken dammit."}
{"text":"Siam Cafe is where my Chinese parents always end up wanting to go to get Chinese food when they come visit me in Cleveland.  The food is tasty, albeit a little more expensive than other Chinese establishments in the area.  They also have a large variety of options to choose from, very few of which have been disappointing.  One of my favorites is their ham (Ti pang), which is large enough to serve 4-6 people and is quite delicious.  Overall, my parents and I have always gone to Siam cafe and left satisfied."}
{"text":"Authentic Cantonese restaurant.  I tried six different dishes and my favorites were the pork with wide rice noodle dish and the basil chicken. The fish soup was sort of like an adventurous version of egg drop and it was also good.  I found the ginger chicken a bit bland.  I don't think it was a faulty preparation but just not my favorite flavors. The snow pea greens were tasty.  The portions are generous and the food is very affordable.  We spent less than 15$ per person and we still had leftovers to take home.  The ambiance is casual and each table has a lazy susan and there's about 20 parking spots in their attached lot.  No issues with service on my first dining experience here, they treated our seven person group well but we did have native Cantonese speakers amongst our group."}
{"text":"With a large birthday party entourage, Siam cafe did everything they could to accommodate our larger party.  The waiter was courteous and fun, we spoke in our native tongue Cantonese but he was very helpful in general.  He made great suggestions that made our tummy's extremely happy as well as had the food out and ready in a short amount of time.  Everything was delicious and reminded me of sweet home cooking.  Prices were fair and my favorites include fried salt and pepper shrimp, watercrest, cold platter, the seafood soup was delicious and hot as well. Accommodating large parties is a huge plus for this place and great service add to this.  Would I go here every day, probably not because there does seem to be intense seasoning but I would recommend this place once in a while to asian food cravers.  I've also come here for lunch and had wide noodles with beef- not bad and I'm a huge stickler on this dish.  I wish they had put a bit more of green onions though!!"}
{"text":"Siam Cafe isn't an americanized Chinese restaurant that most people are used to. I've been so used to eating that typical greasy, heavy, & loaded with msg type of 'Chinese' fare.   What I noticed with pretty much everything I've tried from here is that the food is light & doesn't weight you down. I had the sweet & sour chicken. The chicken was crispy & sweet & sour was thin & wasn't overly sweet like your typical sweet & sour chicken. It was very good! The pan fried noodles with shrimp & veggies was tasty.   The service was great. The staff was very nice & attentive. The food came out quickly after ordering."}
{"text":"It is delicious. We order crabs and fish, and green vegetables, the price is similar with table 45. But table 45 doesn't offer so delicious crabs and fish with this price. It deserves us to come here again."}
{"text":"Dined there once and was not so impressed. Perhaps I'm just so used to spicy Chinese food already."}
{"text":"I was actually a bit dissapointed with our visit to Siams.   The service was terrible and the food was meh.   We started with the coconut soup and it was over cooked making the coconut milk be chunky and lacked any type of flavor. We actually sent it back.   Then we got a variety of different dishes to try. The shrimp low main was flavorless and boring. The paradise shrimp was actually pretty tasty. This weird red and white dish. The red was sweet n sour, it was okay. The white side was really bad. I don't even know what kind of sauce it was. But, it had the constancy of snot and had absolutely no flavor at all. The spicy shrimp, veggies and scallops weren't bad. The sad part was, they cut all of the scallops into thirds. So, for a $20 dish. I got about 2 scallops.   The black forest cake was boring. You could taste it came out of a box. All in all. Not a good experience. I don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"Bad greasy noodles for the Vietnamese soup noodles (like pho).  Thick meat that was really fatty and near impossible for me to eat.  Soup had no flavor and seemed like just MSG water...did I mention the layer of fat/grease on top?  Service is always fine though they are slow with the water refills, but that's pretty standard for Asian restaurants.  Very disappointed overall."}
{"text":"My heart is bleeding to do this but here you go, three stars down...The place definitely has a potential and good food but apparently between all the deliciousness brooding in the kitchen and your table there is an abyss of bad customer service. First, nobody notices us for good 10 minutes. By nobody I mean: not even water was offered. Then absolutely non-English speaking waiter appears and rubs his ear and smiles when we ask him about the complicated dishes on the menu. After a very long process of ordering food (which reminded me running under the water) we got wonton soup which was tepid at the most and for whatever reason not so tasty. My friends politely asked to take the soups back ( they literally tried couple of spoons), and the middle-aged waitress started shaming them for not wanting the soup as if they were preschoolers wanting dessert instead of dinner. - Did you know what you were ordering? - Yes, we did. but the taste was disappointing. - What was wrong? - Well the dumplings.. - What's wrong with the dumplings? You did know there are shrimp in them? My ears almost started to bleed listening to this conversation which should have never taken a place in a first place. Golden rule: if customer barely touched the meal and did not like it, customer has a right to return in to the kitchen. Period. Even if you happen to serve the most unbelievable Won ton with mushy dumplings. I felt thoroughly embarrassed and somewhat angry. Then main course arrived. My guests got their fried rice with shrimp first, and then I got mine pad thai..10 minutes later. 10 minutes may be not a long time in terms of waiting when it comes to anything else but two hungry men who finished their meals almost in 5 minutes. My dish was not even tepid, it was cold. I was scared to send it back to be reheated because I was sure that the waitress was already cursing us out in the kitchen. But the most unexpected happened already home: the splitting headache followed by the waves of nausea. So here you go, Siam's café: it's not me, it's you. Good bye forever, my beloved oriental star. I think I should start seeing other restaurants."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese- Vietnamese  Food in Cleveland...IF you know what to order.  DO NOT order \"American food\" IE: fried rice of any type. Beef and broccoli, Generals anything, Orange or pork fried anything. Sweet and Sour anything! LOL A really experienced and mature cook team creates very authentic seafood dishes and Chinese, Vietnamese staples in the \"high \" style  Try the goi con ( Vietnamese spring rolls, best in the city), Crab stuffed fried tofu ( oh man..w/ perfect ginger sauce), and any seafood and PHO'.  The duck is good, but not produced on site. Don't order the fried noodles; very oily.  True quality Asian food...nice casual dining..cute dining room w/ fresh fish swimming in multiple very clean tanks, waiting to be someones dinner!.   Very crowded on weekends, bad neighborhood, but private parking."}
{"text":"While there are other Chinese restuarants I would choose to go to before Siam cafe, they do have some decently good dishes.  The few times I've come here are with people who absolutely love Siam cafe and thus, know what to order. My friend wrote on the paper on the table each of the dishes we wanted and the waitress just wrote those down and put in our order. All the dishes we ordered are really good.  My favorite is probably the basil chicken (I've had it twice now and it was just as good both times). The garlic onchoy (I think, some form of greens) was also really good.  I can't remember everything else we had but it was all yums. Again, go with someone who knows what to order or take recommendations from some yelpers :)   Service was decent, although we'd have to flag down waiters to get refills on water/rice/tea but that's kind of normal for Chinese restaurants. It's usually pretty crowded but they serve pretty quickly and I've never had to wait for a long time for a table. I also love that you get dessert at the end, soo yummy."}
{"text":"I decided to forgo my usually scheduled stop at Hunan Coventry I was a bit thrown off by the wide variety and sheer number of items on the menu. I figured that this would be a jack-of-all-trades-but-master-of-none type experience. But each of the dishes we ordered was very well executed.  I would like to highlight the tamarind fish as being particularly delicious. I might decide to make this place a new tradition."}
{"text":"The hours of this place blew me away. Open until midnight?! For real? On a Monday? Well okay then! Lol. I strolled up here and had a seat. The staff is well-dressed and friendly. The decor is simple and not overwhelming. I started off with 2 appetizers, the Siam Wings, wish are like... somehow boneless, but they look like a regular wing. They were very good! I also had the stuffed crab claw. Amazing. So rich and just tasted incredible. For dinner I had the Seafood Dynasty. I LOVED the sauce that everything was draped in and the portion was huge. I'm not a fan of squid of mussels so I just took those pieces out of my dish. I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE FOR LUNCH IF YOURE ON A TIME CONSTRAINT!! Ppl who came after I ordered are eating and I'm still waiting for my meal. Then it was wrong. Offered to fix, came back wrong AGAIN!!!Last time for me! Wound up going back too work late and hungry!! Guy across from me didn't get his meal at all."}
{"text":"Variety of seafood items on menu. That allow for different tastes. Love fried salted squid, stuffed chicken wings and pepper steak. Seafood curry is heaven. Service is great and restaurant is always clean."}
{"text":"We love it! Fast, huge selection, and great service. This is one of the nicer sized locations for dining around Asia Town and they've been here for a long time. Having it down has to help, as they are consistently on point with everything we try. Great value and a go to take out place at least twice a month. We do so love Siam Cafe. Great tofu, vegetarian options, and appetizers. I need to work through some of the more exotic items soon."}
{"text":"So far, this place is closest to authentic chinese food I've found in cleveland (I'm from t.o.).  The portions are pretty generous and the prices are reasonable. There are some more americanized food, but that's fine since there's a lot of variety.  The service is usually really good (friendly and fast). The only complain is that one time the waiter recommended the fish and it was  pretty bad (and relatively expensive).  5 stars for being in cleveland."}
{"text":"It's a good Chinese restaurant. That is as far as it goes. I have heard so much about this place, I was eager to try it out, but I should say I was disappointed with the service when I got there. It was busy for a weekday night. The food was good but not extraordinary. Very less options for vegetarians. I ordered a curry and wanted cashews to be added in it (not included in the menu item). I was charged $2 for adding cashews, but they were not added! I wanted to substitute the white rice with fried rice, but apparently that had to be a whole order of fried rice as it's made to order. All in all, I was charged more than the menu price for the add-ons which I never got."}
{"text":"Certainly the best Asian food I've had in the Cleveland area, but I've mainly been frequenting the \"All You Can Eat Heart Exploder\" places. Seriously, this place has the largest and most expansive menu that I've seen outside of San Francisco.   I went there on a Sunday afternoon during the brunch rush but still had no problem getting a table quickly. Service was good, but the first sign that things were going to get wacky was when one of my friends was served a bowl of wonton soup about twice the size of her head. The serving sizes only got bigger from there. The crazy portions of garlic chicken lo mein and random fried rice we all shared were miles away from your normal sodium-soaked strip-mall fare."}
{"text":"Went to Siam last night (and many times in the past) and it was surprisingly slow, which was fine by us.  The food was on point as usual.  The service is very good.  We've never tried their thai food, but the Chinese is our favorite in the city.  The sichuan fish (flounder?) is amazing.  Eric's favorite and the pan fried noodles are also superb."}
{"text":"I'm always a bit cautious when I come across Asian restaurants that try to serve multiple Asian cuisines - more often than not, they don't end up doing any of them really well.  From the Yelp reviews - there are a number of folks that really like this place - which drew me to it. When I entered, I immediately noted a lot of folks with Asian ancestry - which to my mind is a good sign - that the food is good enough that it attracts a fan base of folks from those countries of origin. But I also noticed an odd funky, unpleasant smell - my guess is that it is the carpeting. If I was running the restaurant, I rip out the carpet and replace it with some sort of durable tile that does not adsorb or emanate odors.  I came in for dinner - in a Thai kind of mood. I was curious to see what they had in the way of Thai offerings. Turns out - not as much as I had hoped for.  I immediately spotted the Tom Yum soup - they serve it with shrimp, which was fine. I was also looking for Som Tom (Papaya Salad) and Kee Mao Gai (Kai?) - basically Drunken Noodles. They offered neither. My first waitress did not understand what I was asking about - so they sent over someone more experienced - she advised they offered neither of those dishes.  So I went with the Tom Yum soup - I ordered a large, extra spicy. I asked how large a large was - turns out, it was waaayyyyy larger than I was expecting. They brought out this massive bowl full of soup (larger than a large bowl of Pho Ga for reference) - with a ladle, and a small cup to ladle the soup into. This bowl of soup would be something a group would order - and then share.  The soup was very average and bland. It was not extra spicy. I added some Sriracha sauce to each small bowl to give it a bit of zip. The shrimp in the soup were cooked perfectly - tender and not overdone. I have to say this is some of the most mediocre Som Tum I have ever eaten.  In any case, the service was good."}
{"text":"Siam Cafe offers a wide variety of Chinese, Vietnamese, and Thai dishes. While not excelling in any particular cuisine, the variety and large menu allow for a wide array of different dishes to share with friends at a meal. The siam chicken wings are particularly tasty - rather than being just generic chicken wings, it's more that they mince the chicken up, mix it with other vegetables and fillings, then deep fry the whole thing. The che ba mau (three color dessert drink) is also very good, and hard to find in other Asian restaurants in Cleveland. I also enjoy the sizzling platters they serve here, as well as the large stews. Siam Cafe also gives you a complimentary dessert at the end of the meal. Overall, a solid restaurant with a nice ambiance, and a good place to go for dinner with a date or a group of friends."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is horrible! Our server cannot speak a lick of English and when he took our order we had to point to the menu what we wanted, we ordered the half deep fried chicken and never got it, the owner even came to the table to check on us and we told him about the chicken and never came back! We will never be back here!"}
{"text":"I've had mixed experiences at this restaurant.  I've gone with friends and thought the food was quite tasty. The place does attract a decent Asian clientele, though not as much as Wonton Gourmet.  On the other hand...  - We ordered a tofu dish and a fish dish once, and when they came out, we realized that the fish dish was prepared in a virtually identical fashion as the tofu dish (except for the few pieces of fish, of course).  Yes, they were in two different parts of the menu and had very different names.  No, they did not warn us when we ordered it.  - I went once with my parents and ordered a whole fish.  The fish came out in about 5 minutes, and the middle of the fish was cold.  When we complained, the waitstaff refused to believe that they could possibly undercook the fish, and started arguing with us.  My parents got extremely annoyed and forced them to send the dish back.  They ignored us for the rest of the time we were there and never apologized.  I guess you could be lucky, or not."}
{"text":"Food: Solid and steady Chinese fare. We landed here late (around 10p) on a Saturday night and ordered the fish maw soup and a couple wok fried dishes, which were prepared Cantonese style. The soup could have had more maw and was otherwise warm and velvety. And the other parts of the meal were well seasoned.  Service/atmosphere: Lively for late dinner on a Saturday night with a mostly full dining room, which thinned out by 1130p. It's a casual place for sure and the staff is friendly, patient and quick."}
{"text":"What to say that the other 189 reviews haven't? I'm into this place.   No complaints about the food. The dishes weren't the best I've ever had, but they were good! Peking duck. Tom yum. Beef ho fun. Massaman curry. Bun Thit. Spicy Cabbage. Pho. EVERYTHING GET IN MY BELLY!!! But really, don't be expecting some Americanized Chinese food BS. I'm sure they have some of that on their menu but really, it seems they stick to authentic recipes mostly. Also, the dish I ordered they listed as spicy but it was not spicy at all. Very delicious! But not spicy."}
{"text":"I adore Chinese food. Authentic or oily and Americanized, it's all good to me. For authentic Cantonese food, I defy you to find better in Cleveland. As some of the reviews here indicate, this is a poorly named restaurant. It should probably be called Guangzhou Café, since the owners are not Thai, and I'm guessing that the entire staff is Chinese. They would do well to focus their menu on their strengths. If you stick to the authentic dishes on the menu, you're likely to love this place. The a la carte vegetables, for example, are divine - Chinese broccoli, pea greens and garlic, etc. The tank-fresh seafood is spectacular and reasonably priced. The entire Cantonese menu, in fact, is great. Everything else is mediocre. There are many places in town that do better Thai, Vietnamese, and American-style Chinese. The poor reviews indicate that disappointment, but those reviewers missed the great stuff hiding in plain sight - the authentic dishes. This is a great place for a big group to have a massive family-style dinner that lets you sample a bit of everything for very little money. Siam Café is a pretty bad Southeast Asian restaurant and a really fabulous Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on the Chinese new year...I expected a busy restaurant with longer then normal wait times...We were seated almost instantly. And then we were abandoned for the next 15 minutes...Finally a waiter came and took our order and brought us water and our tea...About 7 minutes later came my wife's diet coke...Another 10 minutes go by and our steamed dumplings arrive...Very tasty but unfortunately they were cold...Then we had the shrimp dumplings soup..Very flavorful...And came out piping hot...Next came our beef lo mein...ive had a lot of lo mein in my life and never like this.. unusual noodle that was a flat pasta...Had good flavor but lacked a normal protion of beef...Service gets 3 stars..Should be 2 but I give them a bump due to the holiday...Food got 3 stars...We will come back because I want to know why this restaurant was rated the best in the country..."}
{"text":"Siam Cafe has an extensive array of foods, but for me it's either hit or miss.  Their hot pot is pretty good, and some of their dishes and appetizers are superb, like their stuffed chicken wings or their deep fried tofu dishes.  I had pho here once though and while it did satisfy my craving for pho, it's better at Pho Hoa.  In addition, we ordered some hot basil chicken, and while the dish itself tasted good, I didn't really taste much basil, nor was it very hot/spicy.  They serve bubble tea as well, which is a big plus for me (as a bubble tea addict).   The prices are very reasonable and the portions are fairly large, for an added bonus."}
{"text":"The best Asian restaurant in Cleveland for large groups in my opinion in Cleveland.  There are other restaurants with more big tables, but the food is not as good.  Other Asian restaurants have much better dishes, but at dinnertime rush it may be tough to seat a party of 8.  Not to say that the food is mediocre.  Siam Cafe serves a large variety of Asian dishes.  There are mostly Thai dishes and Chinese dishes.  I'm a huge fan of their basil beef/basil chicken dishes.  Other dishes that I order often are the sauteed fish filet with vegetable, the minced beef and egg drop soup, and the beef short ribs with black pepper sauce.  The hot plates and dishes served in clay pots are also very good.  I recently ordered the stir fried beef and vegetable over rice noodles and was pleased to see that the portion size was enough for two meals.  Siam Cafe tries to do a lot of dishes.  If you go to an Asian restaurant that specializes more in a particular regional Chinese cuisine (Cantonese, Szechuan), you will probably enjoy the respective dishes there more.  But if you want to enjoy a huge variety of Asian dishes with a lot of your friends, this is a great restaurant to go to."}
{"text":"I was flabbergasted by the cheap prices of the food and drinks here. Then I was blown away by the service--friendly, professional, attentive--and the food!  Quite good, fresh, humongous portions.  My only gripe is that I ordered one of the beef entrees and requested it to be very spicy. The dish already had a \"spicy\" denoter next to it and I made sure to tell them I wanted it hot, hot, hot! (I eat lots of Thai and West Indian food and have a steel palate...)  NO spice whatsoever to my beef:( Although it was very tasty:)  I would return here, especially if one of those days I'm looking to eat well on a dime!"}
{"text":"Really decent Chinese food in Cleveland. My wife and I come here whenever we come to Cleveland to get some Chinese-made seafood and bubble tea. The restaurant is usually quite crowded on weekends so you may want to go early or be prepared to wait a little bit. This time, we ordered the salt/pepper pork chops and ginger/scallion lobster. The lobster was quite fresh and was excellently prepared. As most Chinese restaurants, you get quite a lot for your money. And the food is comparable to anything that I might get in California. So its a great place to go when we get cravings for authentic Chinese food. The only issue this time was that we were in a part of the restaurant where it was difficult to get the attention of the wait staff."}
{"text":"Excellent beef ribs, excellent hot BASIL chicken , great Sunday dinners, I see sunday evening is a good time to go, wasn't crowded ( surprisingly)"}
{"text":"Nice selection on vegan options and for a self posed temporary vegan like myself you can try the tofu pot (c4) with shrimp stuffing, shitake mushroom, Chinese sausage and the sweet broth of chicken. I ate all the veg part and had my friends ate all the non-veg. Worked out great! The chicken soup can sure warm you up. My friends also mentioned the claypot #1 with beef brisket is one of the best they've had and trust me they r both picky eaters who've had meals in Chinatown everywhere."}
{"text":"This was a great place! They had a great variety of dishes! The spring rolls were amazing. The service was good and it was nice to see a lot of Asian families there. The bubble tea was great! We will be back to try some different dishes."}
{"text":"I at least visit Siam cafe once a month. There are variety of food here. Their food is quite authentic. Not only you can choose American Chinese food from the menu but also authentic Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese food. The waiter and waitress are very friendly also. Especially love their operational time. Which Asian restaurant beside Chinese take out opened this late. I personally hope they can open 24 hr. Casino is not far away from Siam cafe. They can have late night business.    I think it is the top 10 best Chinese restaurant in Cleveland. I didn't give 5 stars for a reason. I hope they can change their carpet. It's a little bit old and dark."}
{"text":"A very interesting place. They have a very very very long menu and had my expectation on the authenticity of the food. I was glad that I was wrong. The menu ranged from authentic Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese to the americanized Chinese food and they are all quite delicious. The portions are huge and the pricing was spot on. Great wait staff as well. If you can't decide between Thai or Chinese food, why have to decide when you can come here and have both."}
{"text":"The best chinese restaurant in Cleveland for me(well, basically there're only Cantonese restaurant..."}
{"text":"This is an update and upgrade for my review of Siam Cafe. In the last two years I have celebrated birthdays, welcomed family, said farewell to friends with tasty dishes at Siam Cafe. The first year I would only go if invited or if my wife insisted. By the second year I was hooked on thier consistently tasty meals and service. Each dish taste like comfort food that makes you want to come back because you know how good it will taste.   Thier take out Items are in their own containers with no sauces sloshing on the outside or spilling onto another dish.   My favorite dish is thier spicy boiled fish."}
{"text":"One of the most frustrating things a diner can experience is inconsistency. Do you think it's an accident people love going (often) to places like Players, Lolita, Fahrenheit, etc? It's because they pretty much know their meal is going to fall somewhere between damn good and holy crap.   So, how did I know not to review Siam Cafe after my first visit? Well, kind of an educated guess in that 1) the place itself is huge, and 2) the menu is hugh-er. Very often that combo guarantees things are going to be all over the board. And, so, they were.   Had I reviewed Siam after my first visit three weeks ago it would have been a five star no-brainer. Ordered the beef short ribs with \"Chef's Special Sauce\" and it was pretty much off-the-charts amazing. But I waited.   Second visit two weeks ago and ordered the same thing. It was very good but totally different than the first time. How does that happen? I imagine they have many people cooking in a place that size and they all do things a bit different. But I didn't want different, I wanted the dream dish from visit one.  Nope.   Wifey didn't join me the first two visits so we decided to go last Saturday after seeing the Rembrandt show (if you missed it, oops, it was great).  So, we ordered the beef satay which was solid, and I made the mistake of ordering a shrimp dish without asking how much it was ($25,00) and wifey ordered a chicken dish which had less flavor than, well, any chicken dish either of us ever had. And my shrimp dish was considerably below average. Hell, I would have kissed average on the lips. This sucked.   So, does that mean we won't go back? Well, my wife won't, and I may not either. I've been to Wonton Gourmet once (it was great) but holding off a review until another visit.  No, it's NOWHERE near the size of Siam but just thought I should try it once more.   Do I suggest you don't go to Siam? Of course not. My guess is with a menu that gigundous there are going to be plenty of wonderful dishes and a few clunkers. Finding the good ones could be a challenge but it could be fun, too. Maybe. Kinda of. But, please, don't be a googootz and order something without a price and NOT ASK. That dish will be worth $25.00 when I grow my hair back. Which I'm not. Ever."}
{"text":"The looks of this restaurant from the inside is quite different from the outside shady look. When you enter you just feel the authentic Thai seafood ambience across. The decoration and the servers give you the typical Thai experience that you expected.  The food is authentic, delicious and fresh. Being the typical Indians, we ordered the tom yum shrimp and mushroom soup, basil and grounded chicken(asked them to make it spicy) and a vegetable fried rice. The flavors were to the taste- I especially liked the basil and grounded chicken and would definitely order it next time I visit this place.  Overall we had a great experience here and the restaurant is open till midnight which in itself is very unique."}
{"text":"I visited Siam Cafe for the first time with a large group for Chinese New Year.   We had decided on a menu beforehand and I enjoyed everything we had! My favorite dish was something wish roasted eggplant (unfortunately I never got the name).   We had a little trouble with the waitstaff, but they were super busy that night so we expected as much.   I really enjoyed my meal there. We all left stuffed and happy."}
{"text":"This is literally the only restaurant I have ever eaten at in the Cleveland area. It wasn't in the nicest part of town. It wasn't the nicest looking restaurant. It wasn't the nicest ambiance (in fact the elevator music was downright annoying). But that which matters most, the food, was delicious and satisfying. Siam Cafe bills itself as a seafood restaurant and the menu certainly has plenty of options from fish, shrimp, and lobster to more exotic (and authentic) fare like jellyfish and frog. There is also the full range of more familiar Americanized dishes. We had a very Thom Yum soup, then a delicious peppered beef and sweet and sour chicken (nicely done without the often excessive amount of breading). The friendly and attentive staff cemented my feeling that should I ever return to Cleveland, I would gladly eat here again."}
{"text":"I have been eating at the Siam Cafe for over a decade and still go back for more.   When i have friends in from out if town I always make a point of taking them here, especially if they are vegetarians.  The food is always delicious and fresh. Its not on the menu but their chrysanthemum tea is AMAZING!!!  Their General's Chicken is some of the best I've ever had. Their Spring Rolls & Chicken Summer Rolls are also deeeee-licious. I've also never tired of ordering the Steak Qu, Hot Basil Beef (not a spicy dish), Beef w/ Pan Fried Noodles, or their Beef Fried Rice. My family raves about their Pad Thai & Seafood Dynasty.   My favorite dish/appetizer has to be their Siam Wings. They take all the bones and meat, except for the tiny end bone, out of a chicken wing. They then mix the meat with vegetables, stuff it all back into the wing, and then deep fry it. The resulting fried stuff wing is out of this world. It is served with a sweet Thai chili sauce that is so good its beyond trying to explain. Make sure you ask for extra. The tiny bone left in the wing makes a perfect means to dip it. Only three wings come to an order. If you plan to split an order and don't want a fight to break out over the last one make sure to ask nicely for a four piece order and they should be able to help you out."}
{"text":"Great food and service always!! They never disappoint. The family style servings are very plentiful. The Fried Pork Chop is one of the best dishes they serve in my view. Bubble tea offerings are slim but they are tasty!!"}
{"text":"Meh. Very....meh.  My parents really wanted to try this restaurant, after talking to the cashier at the AsiaTown store. I just nodded my head and took them over to Siam Cafe.  It was surprisingly...empty for 11am on a Saturday. Perhaps it was because there was a Moon Festival event later that day? Maybe everyone was out of town? I'm not sure.  Anyways, we ordered some singapore noodles and beef noodles to go. I...was not too impressed. It lacked flavor and it was oily. I mean, if you have a craving, definitely go, but... it's not somewhere where I would be like, \"omg, this is AMAZING.\" It was more like.... \"umm... this is okay. It's the midwest, what do you expect.\"  Perhaps I need to try more items off the menu....?"}
{"text":"this is probably the most legit Chinese restaurant in Cleveland. why? because they have freaking real seafood like lobsters and steamed flounders!  my friends and I went there right after Chinese new year and this place was packed. we waited for 45 minutes even with a reservation. the service was pretty good, albeit their busy schedule. they may not be as busy during other times tho.   food recommended: lobster with ginger and scallions - pretty good, no other comment. one small lobster is prob 24 bucks and one large one is prob 50+. hot basil chicken - this is not really a Chinese dish but it was really really good!! steamed flounder - you have to order a steamed fish dish there because there is no where else in Cleveland as far as I know that has this kind of dish, very authentic. pork shank- this baby is huge! I thought the flavor was pretty close to the ones I had in China but I think the skin could be a littleee more fried and the color could be darker. the sauteed squid or spare ribs were both pretty meh - not recommended. the sour and spicy potato slices is a pretty Chinese dish that I didn't see anywhere else in Cleveland, highly recommended! walnut shrimp - this is not a mainland dish I suppose, maybe a Taiwanese thing? but it was ok its kinda cold. beef noodle chao niu he - this is a really Chinese dish as well, pretty well done!  as you can tell, this restaurant is pretty much like a real restaurant that can survive in China. It is also not very MSG charged, unlike Szechuan and wonton, which showed their confidence in their dishes. thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This place is ehh... I suppose I'd eat here again one day.  Only because I was told I didn't order the 'right dishes'. We ordered Siam wings (so-so), coconut milk tom yum soup (blak), spicy pork chop (eww), and watercrest with garlic (bland).   We went on a Friday night, and this place is pretty happening.  People around seemed to enjoy the food.  The portions are big, prices are small.  The service was very good--very attentive and happy to serve.  Updated review..to be continued.."}
{"text":"I have been to Siam Cafe a few times now and have only sampled a small number of dishes from their giant menu. The service has always been good. I have everything that I have ordered so far. The menu is broken down by the type of meat and not cuisine. I don't know if that is helpful or not. Siam is a good place to go if you would just like to try something on a whim. I am sure some things on the menu are better than others but... I will quote Prodigy from Mobb Deep even though it barely applies:  Life is a gamble, we scramble for money.  I might crack a smile but ain't a damn thing funny."}
{"text":"Had Sliced Beef with Satay Sauce today. It was perfect. The sauce was bright and fragrant thanks to the fresh ginger. The rice was softer (and stickier) than the rice at most pan-Asian restaurants. Will definitely go back. Only 4 stars because I've only tasted one item."}
{"text":"One of the best, most consistent, longstanding \"Chinese\" restaurants in the area - it's been Siam Cafe, Bo Loong, and Li Wah, and Siam Cafe is generally our first choice. A great authentic menu, and nice portions as well. Definitely a place you should try."}
{"text":"Out of all the restaurants that serve Calamari, I would say Siam Cafe serves the best! I have been to many Thai restaurants in CA, and across the U.S.,  but nothing can compare to their crunchy-on-the-outside, tender-on-the-inside, very tasty Calamari! Of course, the rest of the menu is just as good!  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The ingredients in Chicken Spring Rolls are not fresh? the chicken tasted old and very salty. The fried cabbage tasted so bad. The Shrimp Lo Mien was so watery. The stuffed tofu pot with mushroom and sausage is really horrible too. Honestly, to make the basic Chinese dishes tasted do bad is not easy. So we asked our server has the ownership been changed? Her reply is we do have different chefs. Now, this explains why!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was concerned about working in Ohio for 3 weeks....mainly because I assumed there wasn't any good asian food here.  Haha.  My friend that lives out here told me about Siam Cafe and how great it is.    I had to make the venture out to the GHETTO of eastside cleveland and check this place out.  Holy crap, every asian person in Ohio was eating at Siam when I arrived.  The place was packed on a Sunday night.  That's always a good sign.  The food was delicious!  The menu is extensive and a bit confusing at first because they have a lot of Chinese dishes and then you see Pad Thai and Tom Yum Soup.  I've never been to a restaurant with a mix of Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai food.  But, let me tell you what I ordered:  * Seafood, Tofu and Vegetable Soup.  So comforting & delicious! * Chef's special, Live Flounder Fish Fried.   Comes out with a sweet black sauce that you pour over it.  It was perfectly cooked and had the right amount of seasoning. * Pad Thai was pretty stinking good and I've had a lot of pad thai! * Honey Walnut Shrimp.  These shrimps were a good size.  Juicy.   * Mango Bubble Tea.  Wish I got an extra order of this to go as a roadie.  I would definitely recommend Siam Cafe if you're in the Cleveland area.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place was cool, little kids run wild, as they should. My friend and I both agreed kids shouldn't be subject to sitting in one spot. Id rather have them run around then sit and scream at the top of their lungs. Asians really know how to keep a sense of family anywhere they settle, one of the many reasons I love the culture as a whole.   I had the Siam Pineapple Fried Rice, it was a lot of food. It was not amazing, but it was good enough for me to go back and try something else. The menu was huge, Vietnamese, Chinese, Thai.   They serve family style too, with a huge rotating plate placed on the table where everyone shares. You don't get that at Applebee's."}
{"text":"Siam Cafe probably has the most authentic Cantonese Chinese food that you can find in Ohio that's not required to special order. My parents will request that we go to Siam Cafe whenever they come visit me from Columbus. Most of the food is usually spot on, i've never had a bad meal here, except that sometimes when I order a dish it'll be different (meaning sweeter and too much sauce) that how it's usually prepared Cantonese style, and it's mainly vegetable dishes that i've had this problem with. Be adventurous and go with the non-americanized dishes please!"}
{"text":"Siam Cafe has become one of my dedicated food haunts, especially for late-night munchies (a girl needs more than Bier Markt pizza and burgers sometimes).  The food here will probably not razzle-dazzle you (not that any Chinese restaurant in Cleveland can really hold that distinction), but it's consistent and quite tasty. That said, a number of dishes are excellent: the Pad Thai, the Thai Basil Chicken, the Salt Baked Squid, and my new favorite, the Vietnamese Pork Chops.  Moreover, the waitstaff is extremely friendly and courteous.   Siam Cafe is definitely one of the best Chinese restaurants in town, and I certainly prefer it over Li Wah and even Wonton Gourmet (both very inconsistent, and their food doesn't taste particularly fresh or clean to me)."}
{"text":"Siam Cafe is the most authentic Asian restaurant in the Cleveland area. The food comes out hot and the service is very good. It can get busy on weekends but the wait is worth it (and usually no longer than 20 mins). They have both authentic Asian food or more americanized Asian food. Their dinner for 4, 8, or 12 is very well priced and their portions are large."}
{"text":"Siam Cafe is one of my go to downtown lunch spots. Good selection of lunch options with an even more extensive dinner menu. You can ask for the dinner menu at lunch and they will accommodate. Some healthy options available including my favorite the sautéed snow pea pod spouts with garlic (when in season). So good and so healthy!  Service is fast however you can't always expect to be served with the rest of the guests at your table. They'll bring the plates out as they finish cooking them. It's actually kind of funny to me and it gives this place even more charm. Close to downtown, easy parking. Nothing fancy just quick and quality. Wifi as well."}
{"text":"I've been going to Siam Cafe since I was little. I've been there more times than I can remember, and the great quality hasn't changed.  The servers are always kind and patient, and the dishes are packed with flavor. I'll list some of my favorite dishes below: - silken tofu on hot plate (a personal favorite) - fried pork - water spinach - eggplant in black bean sauce  - lobster (we get this every single time, and the lobster is always fresh and coated in a delicious sauce) - mussels - honey walnut chicken (plated with lots of broccoli) - beef steak on hot plate  drinks/dessert: - taro bubble tea (strawberry and coconut are also good) - mango mouse cake  I do not recommend the red bean ice cream since the portion is extremely small, and the ice cream is icy. If you aren't given a complementary taro tapioca dessert soup after your meal, just ask! It's sweet and creamy with bits of taro. Siam Cafe has been consistently amazing over the years, and their food is always fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Oohhh another spot I've been coming to for years...not as long as I remember but close enough. Almost every family dinner I have at a restaurant ends up at this place!!!  If you come here for lunch, they have pretty good specials. Well actually I haven't come here for lunch in a bit, but when I did...this is what I ordered... The pho is pretty decent here, hard to find good pho (was a pho place nearby but I believe closed now), and the bun dit nuong (vermicelli rice noodle salad) too. Sometimes I order the pad thai and other dishes, but generally I go for the 2 mentioned first.  For dinner, you should order more traditional Chinese stuff. My entire family always comes here for big meals (that's at least 10 people minumum and goes up to 17) and anytime there's something to celebrate. Not all the dishes are spectacular, but all are pretty darn good. My family is Chinese so they would know, even my grandma doesn't complain (or at least I don't hear it). They even make things without any msg too, which is sometimes quite hard for certain dishes, but they'll do it. Sometimes it needs to be requested though.  Well, I guess the ambience isn't anything special and neither is the decor. Just usual functional style. Service is always good, as expected from a place in Chinatown. If a buncha people who originated from China eat here, I'd say its a good place to eat."}
{"text":"I've really enjoyed Siam Cafe every time I've dined here.  My choices have varied from the pad thai (good but different, I don't think they specialize in Thai cuisine) to some standard Chinese dishes of combined meat and vegetables.  The service is always prompt and polite, and the prices are extremely reasonable for the portions and quality."}
{"text":"This by bar is one of Cleveland's best kept secrets........Being a long time food critic and a native of new york, my pallet for great food is keener than the average. I chose this Asian/Thai restaurant because I was impressed by the details that former patrons wrote about their dishes and their over all rave reviews.   This place has surpassed every expectation that I had. Driving through the Cleveland's china district was culturally refreshing. It is not as large as the china district in new york but it is a place that you must experience here in the city. The restaurant for one is very clean, two I have not experienced service this great accept for extremely prestigious 5 stars restaurants. Lastly, the food here is impeccable for the price$$$$$$$. I came here with an open mind willing to try different dishes. I order spring rolls and stuffed fried chicken as appetizers, both were to die for however, if you could only pick one I recommend the stuff chicken wings!!!!!!! The entree that I chose was the Hot basil with grounded chicken, you can order this dish with the option of chicken, pork, or beef. I though it was cooked to perfection with the right amount of spices. I'm all good for a nice dish with a kick of spice to it and this was the perfect balance. My friend order the fried pork chops with spicy salt, It was so impressive, crunchy seasoned and the portions could feed three people!!!!!!!!!! They cut up the pork chops in little neat pieces and deep fry them.   Again, you will not find a restaurant with this quality of food, service and the portion size for the price !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I definitely will eat here again and deem this restaurant Cleveland's best kept secret for Asian/Thai cuisines and confidently rate it 5 stars for the quality, price and service.   P.S The shrimp will be my next dish here!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going here for years for our get togethers. The have quite a diverse menu of Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese dishes.  Portions are large and the food is very consistent.  Service is always great and the place is really packed on weekends.  They have fresh, live tilapia, flounder, crab, and lobster in the tanks in the dining room.  We typically order the family style Chinese dinners which come with soup, an assortment of entrees that you can pick from, and sweet taro tapioca for dessert.  If you don't like any of the family dinner menu choices, substitutions are no problem!  My family really likes their Pad Thai, fried whole chicken, and the Beef Tenderloin with Asian Greens. The fried tofu squares and Walnut Shrimp are really good too!  The also have a nice bubble tea selection.  Stop in for some tasty and fairly authentic Asian fusion nomz!  Nomnomnom!"}
{"text":"Siam cafe is so delicious! I love the string beans in garlic black bean sauce. Delicious place! Didn't realize it was chinese new year tonight. Place was packed. Food was still great, staff was nice - portions are huge - good value!"}
{"text":"Impressed! Next time I'm in Cleveland I'll definitely be back to try more options. Their menu is EXTENSIVE. It took us over 10 minutes just To start looking through it. I went with their version of drunken noodles (not called that on the menu). Another in my party got the Pho and another individual got one of their vegetarian eggplant dishes. Everything was amazing and the portions are HUGE - and you can't beat the price! They have a full bar as well. A true fusion restaurant and each dish done well."}
{"text":"I like this place for celebrating group occasions, lots of big circle tables with a lazy susan to share a variety of dishes. Plus they have a private parking lot which is a big thing for me. So are bathrooms, and unfortunately Siam, I think you can update or clean these guys a bit better.  The food is the reason why I keep coming back though. It's one of my top 3 Asian restaurants here in CLE. They offer Chinese and Thai cuisine, with an excellent selection. The menu is laid out according to the type of food you crave: soup, poultry, noodle, seafood, vegetarian, chef specialties etc.   From my most recent visit, I ordered green curry chicken which had a red chili pepper next to it on the menu. Knowing this place cooks a lot of Thai fare, I was expecting a little more beads of sweat to form on my forehead. In fact, I barely tasted any spiciness in it at all, so for those of you who don't like spicy food, I would give this a go. It's made with coconut milk and mixed with eggplant, squash and green bean. The dish was plentiful to make leftovers my lunch the next day. The dish does come with white rice, however, in a party of four, we were given one small bowel of community rice to split  As for service, friendly as hell, and the manager on site, Henry, always strolls around to ensure everyone is enjoying their experience. I will admit the service is a little slow and they forget things at times.   Regardless, the food is excellent and that's what keeps me coming back.  PS, love their pad thai!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, our reservations were not honored despite showing up 5 minutes early with our entire party. It was a disappointing and unfortunate experience, especially since the conversation with the manager and owner didn't result in a resolution. I tried my best to politely ask how long it would be before we were seated, to which he responded he did not know nor did he have control over the diners. I overheard the hostess inform the customer in front of me that the wait would be 2 hours, so I told him that we couldn't wait 2 hours since it was our grandmother's birthday. I'm sure my frustration was apparent, especially since I do think highly of the restaurant from previous dining experiences. We ultimately decided to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I ordered a grilled pork chop and a bubble green tea when I got my pork chop it was bredded and deep fried. I specifically ordered a grilled chop because I don't like to eat alot of fried food so when it came out I immediately asked the waiter about it she said that they always fry it, on the menu it says grilled to perfection not fried to perfection and by the time we got our check my drink that I ordered when I sat down finally came would never go back"}
