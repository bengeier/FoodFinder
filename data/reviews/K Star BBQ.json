{"text":"K Star has great brisket and pulled pork sandwiches.  The side items are also really good. I especially loved the potato salad and baked beans. Both of these sides had chunks of smokey bacon mixed in. They will cater private events for you."}
{"text":"Being from Kansas, it has been hard finding Bbq like at home. This truck was the Only Reason I went to Friday Night Food Truck...clear out in Lake Pleasant.

 Every place I looked for reviews had 5 stars. When I read they made their own sauce, I had to try it. 

I got the pulled pork sandwich, with 2 sides. Chose mac and cheese and beans. Only 8 bucks..that is a deal.

(Last weekend went to a Bbq truck..got 2 pulled pork tacos for 8 bucks...was not worth it.)

You get your money with K Star BbQ 


 I can assure you, that the meat itself is delicious, tender and flavorful.  I just happen to love bbq which their is Amazing.  

In fact if they bottle it, please let me know..bc I will buy some.


Thank you for some down home stick to your ribs..bbq. We will be looking to see where you will be parked next...

Also just a FYI, they do catering too!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love getting BBQ from K Star! They do an awesome job with smoked meat that are flavorful and the portion size is great. We have never had a bad meal from them and would recommend them to anyone that like great BBQ."}
{"text":"Can't check in, too far from Peoria where they claim their location. The truck came to Chandler. I kept it simple and had pulled pork and beans. The pork had a good smoky flavor.  The pork was a tad dry, but not too bad.  They had a few sauces.  I found the \"dragon's breath\" to have the best flavor, and it really wasn't that spicy (despite their claims to the contrary).  Their regular sauce was too sweet and not very flavorful.

The beans were pretty good.  Decent flavor with bits of bacon.

Overall, a respectable offering.  Not the best BBQ in town, but pretty good.  I could see eating with them again if their truck comes back."}
{"text":"HOLY DELICIOUS!  We ordered catering for my company's Ops meeting today - I needed to feed 18 rough, tough and hungry guys from the ND and TX oil fields. We were ALL very impressed with the quality and taste of the food! We've never ordered catering from a food truck but wanted something different than the usual salad and sandwiches (boring!). I'm SO glad we took that chance with K Star! We will be back! Thank you Kathy and Kevin and Richard!"}
{"text":"With a hectic schedule we were finally able to stop in and pick up dinner tonight. First of all we are very picky about cleanliness I am super happy that they are clean and I must say a beautiful trailer. We ordered our food from very friendly people. Great choice of sauces. The brisket was amazing just the right amount of flavor. The Mac n Cheese was perfect the beans were like nothing I have ever tasted I loved them. My husband is super super picky about food and have yet to find a good pulled pork until now he loved it. I can't wait to go back. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Every Wednesday a food truck comes to my office, and today K Star BBQ was here. They had huge selections and quite a few meals that come with two sides. I ordered the brisket sandwich, coleslaw, and baked beans. The beans were amazing  and had bits of bacon. I'm a huge fan of coleslaw, but it can be hit and miss depending where you get it. This was great. My brisket had great flavor and was tender. The only downside for me is the bun was falling apart before I could even pick it up. It would've been better for me if it was toasted a little to keep it from getting g so soggy so quick."}
{"text":"Very unprofessional. I had read posts stating they have a tendency of canceling last minute but I didn't read much into it. I booked them and they begged me not to book a 2nd truck as it hurts their business... so I didn't. Then they sent me a quick message saying \"sorry,  nor gonna make it\" and won't respond back to my emails or calls. Had to cancel my event."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service! Mac is homemade and cheesy, potato salad is just as delish.  Best Brisket ever, especially with their BBQ sauce.  Smoked Sausages are juicy with the perfect bite, I can't wait until next time...definitely a customer for life!!!!"}
