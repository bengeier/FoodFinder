{"text":"While waiting for my order I witnessed one of the cooks walk in through the back door, stop to put out his cigarette, and start making a pizza without washing his hands. I will never return to this establishment and hope the health inspector is thorough when checking this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great pizza and hoagies at good prices I always stop in for a slice when I'm near by."}
{"text":"My first time stopping in I only bought some tea on a hot summer today, but noted that it smelled great if I ever stopped by if I was hungry. My second time nearby I had a pepperoni pizza and it was quite good! Greasy, but tasty! On food alone, I'd give it 4 stars, But, based on how accommodating the staff was I have to give it 5 stars! Other notes: small interior with a few outdoor tables"}
{"text":"Best delivery in Lawrenceville hands down! Ask for extra cheese!"}
{"text":"My business is very near That's Amore, and without a measure of planning (which is usually beyond the scope of my skills on any given day) I wind up sometime in the afternoon realizing I have neglected to eat anything all day, and have no idea what I'm going to do for lunch. Now, you can only eat SO MUCH pizza in any given week. Seriously- trust me. I have experience with this. So, much of the time, I'll order a sandwich from That's Amore. My particular favorite is the Italian sub (I get it without onions or dressing). I've also had the meatball sub a few times, which is great too, but messy. There's just some days when I know from the start that I do not have the organization I'll need to keep a sloppy sandwich from landing on my clothing. Still- the meatball sub is a pretty good bet anyway. The pizza is good, though I prefer it when I have someone to share with and can order a whole pie instead of slices. The slices are good too, but given a choice I'm not a fan of warmed-up pizza vs fresh out of the oven. The pies are good sized but on the greasy-gooey side, which IMO does nothing to detract from the taste but will make you think twice about skipping that workout later. 

I've found the staff to be friendly and personable, and there have been times when I was too busy or just too tired to go over to pick up my order, and they've happily brought it to me. Now, granted, I'm something of a \"regular\" and a local business owner, which may tint my experience somewhat, but I've been happy to continue to do business with them and there is nothing like a nice, hot Italian sub when you're starving. They also have a selection of soft drinks and a surprisingly full menu of salads, sides and entrees along with the pizza and sub menu."}
{"text":"By Pittsburgh pizzaria standards, this place is pretty great. The crust is thin and crispy (as pizza should be!), there is no sugary sweet taste to the sauce, and they do not automatically give you a side of ranch under the assumption that that is an acceptable way to eat pizza. It's also super cheap. Also, PIZZA BY THE SLICE! WIN!

They do tend to be inconsistent, as the single slices are never the same size from one visit to the next. One time, my slice was literally wet and soggy and inedible at the bottom.

When you want to spend under $5 on a (decent) meal, go here."}
{"text":"OK.  So when your favorite pizza place starts changing their ingredients after 15 years of being a loyal customer, it's time to go exploring.  We are on our fifth restaurant and may possibly have a winner, although I feel further trials may be in order.  Went to Than's Amore Pizza on Butler Street in Lawrenceville for the first time last night.  The shop looks great, the people were professional, but the girl behind the counter needs to get off her cell phone and come up for air every once and awhile.  The Chef was precise, fast and more than qualified to put together a pizza.  The pizza was very good.  Ordered mushroom and sausage.  The mushrooms were plentiful and very good.  It was, however, a bit difficult to see any sausage on board.  Good cheese and a nice crust.
Doesn't anyone toss dough  anymore?  My favorite part of a pizza is when the erratic edges of a tossed pizza bubble and burn a bit.  That's the best for me.  This is what keeps my quest on-going.  If you are in the area and would like a very good pizza, I would recommend That's Amore.
Now go figure out how to put bubbles in your pizza perimeters!!!"}
{"text":"I was turned on to this place by my buddy who said it was the best pizza in Lawrenceville. He was right. I was very impressed. That perfect level of grease, lots of cheese, and the sauce wasn't that awful sugary crap at most Pittsburgh pizza shops. I will be back again many times."}
{"text":"We order from here often. Their calzones and white pizza are delicious! Delivery is always very prompt."}
{"text":"Solid pizza joint with cool and friendly staff. Slices are cheap, $2:50. Also I tried a  turkey bacon 12 in. Came to $9:00...not bad deal for the size and was delicious."}
{"text":"I work close to here so we get pizza from here pretty often. It's always pretty tasty and comes at a good price. Never a complaint."}
{"text":"Ordered a large cheese pizza and it was great. Good quality cheese and sauce. The crust was good. I would order again."}
{"text":"My husband and I got some slices to go from here and were really unimpressed for the price. Having recently moved here from NYC, this seemed not even as good as a dollar slice. Bland, nothing special with the crust or the cheese or toppings. Maybe the whole pizzas are better, but the slice to go seemed like not a great move. Was happy they had cracked red pepper and cheese to top the pizza with at least. Since we tried this place we also tried Spirit, and I liked Spirit's pizza a lot more."}
{"text":"It turns out that trying to find eats on Butler street after 10pm on a Tuesday is a major challenge. We went up and down Butler street trying to find some grub, but all the kitchens of our usual spots were closed.  It was either beer for dinner or venture into unexplored late-night food territory.  We noticed Pizza Amore as we drove by but wrote it off as another \"probably only good while drunk\" pizza joint, until I decided to Yelp it.  4.5 stars?!  We had to give it a shot.

While we had beers next door at Remedy while waiting for the pizza to be made, we overheard some other beer drinkers raving about how amazing the homemade meatballs at Pizza Amore were.  A totally out-of-the-blue coincidence. Good thing we had ordered meatballs on half of our pizza!

When we finally got the pizza, we were so pleasantly surprised at how much better it was than what we had expected based on the shop front.  The crust was very tasty, just the right mixture of chewiness and crispiness, and just the right tinge of sweetness.  The meatballs were indeed delicious, and they are in fact homemade (next time I'm trying the meatball hoagie).  The pizza did not make it home.  We ate the whole thing standing on the street and have returned for takeout several times since."}
{"text":"Some lucky bugger at work who won a Super Bowl pool sprung for pizza today based on the recommendation of another co-worker who swears by this place.

Hey, who passes up free pizza during a recession?

 It's easy to see why one would pledge allegiance to a pizza parlor such as That's Amore. They offer a solid, oily, gooey, chewy, moderately thick pizza that I found no fault with. It was pretty big also and was a crowd-pleaser fer sure. I'd love to watch them throw the dough for this pie."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend live right down the street and have ordered pizza from every pizza place on butler street. This place has the best!!!!! Yummyyyy I'm hungry."}
{"text":"Average pizza and sandwiches.  Nothing great but nothing horrible either.  Overall, their pizza just lacks any defining flavor.  With that said, it's probably the best pizza place within walking distance of my home but there are several better places that are a short drive away."}
{"text":"Let's get this out of the way: you're not going to go here for the atmosphere (there is no seating), or the service (they're gruff), so the food better be good. Well, I'm sorry to report that it's just mediocre. In a city full pizza places (hell or even just on Butler Street), there are way better options. I won't go back and I can't offer a recommendation."}
{"text":"Not great pizza.  But not bad, either.  In all likelihood, I would not eat here except it's the closest pizzeria to my house.  I've had nothing but the pizza so I can't judge the sandwiches or calzones etc."}
