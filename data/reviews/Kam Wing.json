{"text":"It seems that most people's experiences dining in were great, and most deliveries not so much.. mine was the latter. \"Pad Thai\" was orange-dyed noodles with absolutely no flavour. General Tao was OK, curry chicken meh, and Sushi rolls were dry and bland. And not cheap by any standards.. Unfortunately quite disappointed."}
{"text":"Cheap eats and free delivery! Offering several different styles of Asian cuisine including sushi, thai, szechwan and more. The dinning room is a bit drab and outdated (I think it used to be a diner before...?) so I usually opt for delivery. The sushi is always fresh and they've always been able to substitute tofu in any dish for my vegetarian friends. Nothing mind blowing but a decent, inexpensive option in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We ordered the orange beef, pad thai combo, and the hunan dumplings in peanut sauce. The food was mediocre but on its own didn't deserve a 1-star rating. That comes from the long and painful session I had on the ivory throne this morning, and the nasty taste of MSG that lingers in my mouth even now, 12 or so hours after consuming the food."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY FROM HERE. We literally waited 2 hours for our food. Called after an hour, ant she said 10 minutes.... Then called again after another half hour and was told \"2 minutes... for real this time.. And complained about it being busy! Never again."}
{"text":"The prices are the best in the area. The food is great. The service is warm and welcoming. I fully enjoyed my meal. Their lunch box special is cheap and big portion. I recommend this place for any one that wants a calm welcoming place to have a decent meal at a great price."}
{"text":"Kam Wing is a local favourite a good example of Canadian-Asian cuisine, if you're looking for authentic Chinese cuisine this place will not impress you. However, if you're looking for the type of Chinese food that you see in Western movies and on TV, look no further, you will be satisfied. 

Kam Wing does offer a great variety of various types of Eastern oriental based cuisine including Thai, Japanese, and Chinese dishes all in one kitchen which I think is fantastic, and there's great family meal packages that incorporate all these different flavours together. Some of the dishes (Kung Pao Chicken, beef & broccoli) i strongly do not recommend, you will be disappointed but other dishes (vegetable/shrimp tempura) are fantastic! Personally my favourite is the crispy sesame beef, while it is covered in honey, which makes the dish very sweet, the breading on the beef manages to remain crispy whether delivery take 45 minutes or you leave it in the sauce overnight, which seems to defy science.

The only major pitfall I have to confess is that more often than not delivery will take 45 minutes to an hour, and I live 15 minutes away by foot! Sometimes the food arrives a little past its fresh point because of this, but on rare occasion the food will arrive promptly and the food is obviously freshly cooked. It for the most part, hit or miss but altogether its exactly what you would expect from your local Canadian Chinese restaurant, and I keep coming back for more so they must be doing something right!"}
{"text":"I have never been this grossed out!

I ordered for delivery the bento box and basil chili chicken. Let's start with the basil chicken: saucy and bland. Not a fan of the stuff.
Bento box: comes with tempura, beff and brocoli and teriaki chicken as the main dish. Sides are sushi, miso soup and salad.
The main dish was microwaved, saugy and undercooked. The shrips were RAW! How dare you serve raw food! If I wanted a microwaved meal, I would of gotten out and bought a f**** tv dinner. 16$ for this crap? HARD PASS.
The miso soup was full of ROTTEN seaweeds, I didn't even touch the stuff. The salad was iceberg salad and a few slices of cucumber with a splash of vinegrette. The sushi was 3 pieces of futomaki and 2 hosomaki. The only thing about the meal that was okay is the avocado hosomaki (not fresh).

In total, I paid (with tip) 42$ for stuff that would be better off in the garbage.

If I could give lower than 1 star I would. Truly revolting."}
{"text":"I ordered last week from Kam Wing. The menu contained very few vegetarian options and the only tofu plate offered used fish sauce. The tofu meal I tasted was alright - neither too bad nor too good, but for the price you will definitely find better Asian cuisine in Montr√©al. An \"okay\" mark if you are looking for something average and are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I really like Asian food and many times I passed the place. Usually it's empty so spent a lot of time till I tried and I didn't regret.
I've tried their Thai soup with chicken which wasn't exactly my taste but it was good, all the veggies were super fresh. My hubby tried the chicken with peanut butter. He loved it.
They have alcohol drinks, too. :)
Later we ordered for delivery and I could try the tom yum soup which was awesome. My husband ordered Pad Thai. It was good.
The delivery was fast.
Cash, debit.
After all 4* from me."}
{"text":"2 hour wait! Terrible service. Don't waste you're money ordering from this place. If you any restaurant in Verdun that uses Livraison Sud-Ouest, do not order unless you don't mind waiting 2.5 hours for cold soggy food."}
