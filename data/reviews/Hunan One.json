{"text":"Although they all come with your choice of soda or soup, and a side of fried rice, this Hunan One offers a very poor variety of lunch specials. However, to be a \"fast food\" take out Chinese restaurant, their food tastes pretty good. 

The Cook needs to add more ingredients to their Shrimp Fried Rice and other specialty fried rice dishes, because they are all very bland tasting. Additionally, their BBQ Ribs and Chicken Wings are small, and at times, they fry their wings too hard.

The Pepper Steak, Sesame Chicken and Lo Mien are Hunan One's tastiest dishes. The staff speaks and understands English pretty well, but they will still mess up your order--so make sure to check everything before you leave."}
{"text":"This is the best (cheap) Chinese take out place in Cleveland.  I've been searching for a decent one in the Cleveland area over the last 5 years or so.  
Their lunch specials are a great deal.  $4.50 for the majority of dishes, and it includes fried rice and a soup.  Years later and they still haven't increased the price.  The hot and sour soup, which is butchered by a lot of other take out places in the area, is actually decent, bordering on tasty (albeit a bit on the salty side).  

Another take out place near this one is Chopsticks on Case campus. I think the dishes at Chopsticks is fairly well done, and when I am already on Case campus, this is an obvious choice.  However, their hot and sour soup is absolutely horrid.  Plus, their customer service is quite rude, which just detracts from the whole experience.  So, when I am not on Case campus and have more options, I rarely go to Chopsticks.  

Of course, not every single dish at Hunan One is delicious, but the majority of them are.  Compared to the options in the area, and with the low prices, I am giving this place full stars."}
{"text":"Personally I think this is one of the best take out Chinese restaurant in city. I've been going to this restaurant since I was little late 90's since then the food tasted better and quality of food is excellent. The area is a little iffy for the nighttime but during the day a lot of employees from the hospital pick up lunch. The prices are great and the portion is plenty. Try going during the weekday for the lunch special."}
{"text":"My coworker and I ordered from Hunan One for lunch today. I ordered the Wonton soup and much to my surprise received a 3 inch long piece of plastic in it. When I called to tell them they said they would send me a new one. I said no thanks and they asked what I wanted. I asked for a refund and the lady said \"we don't do refunds\" but that she'd comp me the next time we ordered. Clearly we will NOT be ordering from them again. They seemed unconcerned and never apologized. Luckily I saw the piece of plastic before eating it... But would caution those who eat there/order from there from now on!"}
{"text":"The chicken fried rice was decent, but the wings and egg rolls were a huge disappointment. The entire lunch left a bad taste in my mouth and made my stomach feel queasy. First, and last, impression was not a good one."}
{"text":"Typical chinese fast food take out; A life saver on the days you are too exhausted to cook and your hunger pangs force you to venture out for some ready made food. I bet everyone has had one of 'those' days.
The lunch and dinner menus are what you would typically expect. Plenty of photographs around to help you choose. Prices are acceptable and the food is good; not spectacular!
The portions are very generous and they also have party packs.
The surroundings can seem a little shady and I wouldnt recommend sitting there to have a meal. I have gone here multiple time, never had an issue!"}
{"text":"Food was great , restaurant was good until they stole my card number when I made an over the phone delivery. I gave them my card number and everything and now I have hundreds of dollars charged to my account. Do not order over the phone, if anything pay with cash!"}
