{"text":"What an awesome experience. The atmosphere was perfect for our anniversary dinner. We were blown away by the care that went into everything we ordered from the drinks to the dishes. Every item was a piece of art! Well done guys, we loved it!"}
{"text":"What a great spot, speakeasy with prohibition style drinks, and tapas small plate meals. I love this place! The owner checks in on all the guests, the staff are super personable, and attentive, with great knowledge of all the drinks and menu if you aren't even sure what you're into - I have yet to be disappointed with their recommendations. Big shout out to Darren who took care of us, I wish I remembered everyone's name we've encountered because they are all great! Good food, great drinks, fantastic hangout!"}
{"text":"The only apt description is nothing short of absolutely phenomenal!  The atmosphere, the service, the food, the drinks, all 100% on point!  I had the shrimp and grits which included chorizo and a soft boiled egg, along with a classic old fashioned...it is possibly the best thing I have ever consumed, and I rarely deal in definitives.  I will definitely be returning whenever I am lucky enough to be in town.  Short story - COME HERE!"}
{"text":"Amazing dining experience!! The cellar at duckworth was just a short stroll from the Iveys hotel for us. The atmosphere is relaxed and inviting. Darren was superb suggesting we visit the beer cellar and recommendations on cocktails and food. We enjoyed each and every recommendation right down to the s'mores!!!  Can't wait to return to try more items on the menu. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I would consider giving this venue zero stars if possible. As soon as we walked into the bar, our small group was made to leave by the extremely bitter hostess only to be brought back in and sat at the bar. All of the bartenders are cold, evasive, and to be honest rude. After ordering a drink and asking to hold the simple syrup, which is a standard and simple request, I was told they would not make it for me if I was going to complain it was \"too bitter\" after trying it. I can only assume this is due to being a female ordering a straight whiskey drink. Overall, the experience of our group was subpar at best; it would be most accurate to say the staff acts pained to serve guests.  Additionally, after we left and were able to see our clothing, purses, and bags in the sunlight, they are all stained from the paint on the bar."}
{"text":"Insane dining experience in the cellar. Craft beer, tomahawk steaks, and exceptional service from my man Darren aka D-Nice."}
{"text":"Parking can be found on the street or there is a paid parking lot right across from the restaurant. You'll see the duckworth's sign, go in,'and immediately when you walk in there is a a set of stairs. Go down them and you are there!   There was a little bit of a wait and you cannot just go drink at the bar without actually being seated by a hostess.   The drink menu is listed on an iPad. I had the red rum drink which was delicious and took about 10 minutes to hand make.   As far as small plates we smaller the waffle cones which sound weird but the flavor profile is the sweet and savory of the meat is amazing. The chicken was crispy and the shrimp crusted coconut was perfectly browned and crunchy.  The Rissoto was good however the rice was a bit too crunchy for me.  Overall I would like to come here for drinks for sure more often as well as sample more food."}
{"text":"My husband and I sat at the bar and were amazed at the care that was taken with each cocktail. It was truly mesmerizing. The mixologists were very intent on making each drink to perfection. We didn't order food, but the customer next to us ordered a hamburger that looked amazing. We thought the atmosphere was perfect. Dark and romantic and not too noisy at all. We will visit again next time we are in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Love this speak easy vibe with brick walls and no windows down in the cellar. Tapas are creative and delicious. Fun place but you may need a reservation."}
{"text":"New to downtown Nc as it was my first visit.  If you like the speakeasy gel they got you covered.  The waiter was great she was very attentive but not pushy and knowledgeable about the food and beer.  About the beer.. they have one of the largest bottle collections I have seen in a while with some hard to find selections.  As for the food .. this was hit and miss. Every thing was prepared well but something was lacking."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. Tuna tartare was awesome as were the scallops with chorizo and cauliflower. Ask for Charles to help you navigate the incredible beer menu. He is super knowledgable. Beer list is so extensive they give you an iPad to navigate."}
{"text":"Loved everything about his place: ambiance, service, drinks and food.  If you are on Charlotte you must go by hear, at list for a cocktail.  The Mojito was to die for, and you should try the taco trio as well! Overall great spot"}
{"text":"First time I ever thought a place was too dark.  The interior is nice but, hidden due to lack of illumination which is too bad.  The beer menu is gargantuan (300+ i guess) and is presented on a electronic  tablet.  Favors porters, sours & stouts and many exotic, limited edition brews which prefer to be aged.  Bring a DD and shoot the pad locks off the wallet because someone of these bottles are over $50/l. Overall a good experience but over priced. This is a three star restaurant with a five star beer menu so they get four stars."}
{"text":"Exceptional. Our 3rd time here and the food and service were spot on! Prompt seating. The brussell sprouts are divine, everytime. Had a citrus \"mocktail\" tonight and it was crisp and did not have any syrupy aftertaste. One of my favorite restaurants in charlotte."}
{"text":"So we moved down from the DC area 2 years ago and we have been struggling with the food down here in Charlotte.  When I say this was the BEST meal I have had since I moved down here, I mean it.  OMG, the food was amazing.  The atmosphere is nice and cozy.  It's small, we sat at the bar and I personally think that was the best decision.  I loved talking to the bartenders and watching them make these exotic drinks.  I had the grouper, rice and artichoke with carrots.  Best grouper ever.  I had the smoked spicy peach margarita, which was delicious.  My husband had the rib eye and he said his steak was very seasoned and very tender.  All in all, we had a great time.  We will definitely be back to try other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"A spectacular restaurant (downstairs).  Don't judge the cellar by the upstairs presentation. We started with drinks at the main-floor bar. The bar on the main floor is really dreadful. The drinks were poorly made--two thumbs down.   The Cellar, however, made up for the lousy drinks. The duck pasta was heavenly. The tacos were exceptional. The cones came with mixed reviews. The polenta fries were delicious.  The service was a bit mechanical and feigned attentiveness. The server seemed inexperienced and the over-the-too concern was a bit too heavy.   Dessert, however, was a nightmare. The French toast was cold. I have no clue what happened to the bananas, but how did they get rubbery and sponge-like? How do you do poorly made French toast? Yuck. Horrible. Run away!"}
{"text":"This place changed my view of Charlotte in the best way possible! Ate bacon appetizer & tuna tartar appetizer. Dave the mixologist served the East Village drink (think Manhattan with a twist). All great! Was even serendipitously seated next to a couple beautiful people in the truest sense."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. Incredibly tasty crafted cocktails companied by the best quality and most delicious small plates I've ever had. Definitely recommend this place. Wonderful service and Ron the bar manager is so talented and welcoming."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here last week with a work group. Had many dishes and they were all tasty. Overall i was very happy with the hummus. I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"We had such a warm welcome from 2 hostesses upstairs that on my way downstairs I had to turn around and walk back up and thank them. We'd had no reception at all from the hostess at another Uptown restaurant last weekend. This place has the same name, some menu similarities, and beverage list on iPad like our favorite restaurant in Corning, NY. We had a wonderful server, Andrea, who was very nice and helpful. We started by sharing the waffle cones, which I would order again in a second. We also got the Mediterranean Flatbread, which was great, and my husband also ordered the Carmelized Brussels, which he loved. Our only disappointment had nothing to do with the restaurant. We had ordered the Campfire Almond S'mores and a woman came in wearing so much perfume that allergies flared for us both and we had to ask for it to be boxed to take home. It was still really good, but it would have been nice to have it straight from the kitchen.  While we were there, the general manager, Charles, came by to introduce himself and chat about our experience, and Andea was attentive during our time there. I like the atmosphere, which reminded me so much of a restaurant in Wilmington, NC, where I worked one summer during college.  We will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Just moved to Charlotte and this is my new fav restaurant. The baked oysters were delicious as was the beet salad. Loved the smokey mac and cheese as well. The flat iron steak was pretty good but didn't compare to my hubby's filet mignon, which was melt in your mouth delicious! Loved the smoked peach margarita and the bartenders willingness to make me a muddled raspberry martini that wasn't on the menu. The service was great. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here based upon 4 1/2 stars on Yelp. It has a nice atmosphere, but lacks the depth of menu. Lamb crops were over cook and when I asked for a carb (bread), server tried to see me an app for an extra $8."}
{"text":"Great menu and selection of beers. I like that they have 5oz and 9oz pours on draft but basically the pricing is ridiculous...about $6 on 5oz and $11 on 9 oz. You can't even get a regular sized 12 oz beer on some of the heavy stouts so you're paying big prices for small glasses. Taking off one star for that. Other than that, food is really good and the selection of beer is awesome too. Tried the tacos - pork belly, chicken and octopus, all very flavorful and the tuna tartare also very good."}
{"text":"Not sure why this is categorized as a gastropub as it seems like so much more.  First off, the atmosphere is awesome...walking down dark stairs to a hostess who then slides open a doorway to reveal what looks like a speakeasy.  Even the music and the staff's attire says speakeasy.   My group ordered several different rounds of beers from the knowledgeable server and a bunch of small plates.  Charcuterie was great (although the cheese portion was woefully inadequate and there wasn't enough jam on the board either).  Other apps we loved were the brussels sprouts, the tacos, cones and in particular the grilled oysters.  And the food came quicker than we could finish it!.    We then ordered dinner (and more drinks).  I had the filet, which was cooked to perfection and came with an arugula and shaved parmesan side.  Others enjoyed the shimp and grits (though it may have been spicier than advertised), grouper, scallops and their hamburger, which was awesome.  Will definitely be back as this place is unlike anything else in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I anticipated the opening of The Cellar immediately upon hearing about the concept in Creative Loafing. I invited a few friends to check it out and am happy I did.  Walking down a stairwell in the Uptown Duckworths leads you to this cool door that opens up to The Cellar. The food, cocktails and decor are totally different than what you get at Duckworths. On my first visit I shared Brussels sprouts and oysters as an app, chose scallops for my entree. For cocktails I had a Blackberry Julep which I felt was worth the price given how strong it was. The scallops were done with a unique garnish of chorizo and currant ...and I loved it.On my second visit I split the truffle Mac N cheese, taco trio and salmon flatbread with a friend. The truffle Mac doesn't disappoint, and the highlight of the taco trio is the braised pork belly taco which makes me wish they let you choose the taco type (the other two - chicken and octopus I thought were just ok) . The salmon flatbread was ok, but not terrible. The highlight of the second visit was the Cellar Smash. I like Moscow mules so enjoyed the ginger flavor infused in the drink.  While the place may be a bit higher than your average happy hour ( they do not do specials) I think it's a nice treat or break from the average beer/ wine and standard bar dishes you get from a typical happy hour. This would also make a nice date spot or place to meet a group of friends for something a little different.    On both visits the manager Charles came out to talk with me and my friends which was a nice personal touch."}
{"text":"My favorite, intimate restaurant in Charlotte.  Tapas style, so prepare to share your food.  The food and the drinks are phenomenal.  You HAVE to try the smoked whiskey sour and the lemon risotto.  More than anything, the ambiance is amazing."}
{"text":"Incredible!  Went with a group of colleagues.  Excellent food, great drink selection.  Server was very knowledgeable and helpful.  We were still discussing it a month later."}
{"text":"Interesting food and cocktails.  Inexpertly curated beer list - way too heavy on the sours.  When you visit here bring your child's college fund and a month-at-a-glance calendar instead of a watch.  Everything, everything.... Drinks and food, takes way too long."}
{"text":"I take a noon time walk in this area and just learned that Duckworth's is open for lunch.  I stopped in and had a delicious philly cheese steak, tater tots, and ice tea.  Served fresh and hot.  Only hesitation is that lunch cost me almost $17 with a tip for good service.  It is one of only a few good restaurants in the area which has many restaurants not as good."}
{"text":"Came to The Cellar on a Tuesday around 8 PM. Table for two please! We wanted to be seated quickly so we chose to sit at a high top table. I love the atmosphere; low lighting, it has a lounge feel to it. Our server, Darren, was knowledgable, attentive, and charismatic. We ordered our drinks: Smoked Whiskey Sour and Redrum. Both were delicious (and strong). The flavors blended perfectly and presentation was nice too. For starters, we ordered the Truffle Fries. Those were good, but what kicked them up a notch was the malt vinegar aioli. It just slapped my mouth with flavor . For our entrées, we ordered the 8 oz. filet mignon (medium) and the 14 oz. ribeye(medium) O.M.G. I wanted to cry. It was glorious, oh so glorious. Tender, juicy, melt in your mouth. For our sides, we chose the Truffle Mac & Cheese and the Caramelized Brussel Sprouts. Flavor explosions and fireworks  At this point my eyes were rolling back. I chose to eat slower than usual to be able to savor each and every bite. When we finished, we were full but we caught site of the desserts. We chose the Corn Flake Crusted French Toast. I just about fell off of that high top chair when I tried the first bite. Crunchy, sweet, decadent. The manager also passed by our table to make sure that we were enjoying our meal and that the service was good. Or it could have been that he thought I had a medical issue due to my eyes rolling after every bite. In any case, the bill came and I knew... I just knew it was going to be high. And it was, but let me tell you, it was worth it. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times before and the food and service is Extrodinary!!. Ben was our waiter and his service and attentiveness was tops. I brought family visitors here and they are still talking about it. Definitely should be a choice when in uptown.  RJ"}
{"text":"I had a great experience. From finding and walking into the small restaurant beneath a restaurant and then the decor and relaxed mood of it. Then the food came... even better! The truffle Gouda mac and cheese was heaven in my mouth, my oysters were amazing, I also tasted my friends filet mignon and it was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I sent an associate there later and he said his scallops and Asparagus were amazing. I've heard such great things about their craft cocktails it's what I'm looking forward to next time. I also love the mini history lesson we got about the previous use of the restaurant. Shows that the people care about their restaurant and always makes a great experience for me!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere, cocktails, tapas, dessert, and service were all excellent! My wife and I especially liked the tuna tartare and flat bread. Perfect seasoning and preparation and fresh ingredients. We look forward to returning on our next visit to Charlotte."}
{"text":"If you want a great show, sit at the bar downstairs. This place makes some work intensive drinks that are very entertaining to watch being concocted (smoke-filled glasses, flame-toasted lemon peels, splash of who knows what, dash of that, shaken, stirred, whirled and poured in an extravagant demonstration) . Small, but inventive menu. Maybe too inventive? Overall, cocktail and food menu seem to be trying too hard to impress. Execution on the more tame scallop with cauliflower and elderberry dish was excellent, though. My companion went for the more adventurous taco trio (1 each chicken, pork belly, shrimp) and was very pleased. All of the dishes and drinks we saw pass by looked delicious and very nicely plated. Not too much left on the plates on their way to the dishwasher either, so others must've been pleased, too. Fabulous ambiance downstairs, which is unexpected based on the sports bar vibe upstairs."}
{"text":"A hidden gem tucked below a fantastic sports bar. When you first walk into Duckworths you are greeted by your typical sports bar scene, plus a few dozen TVs. If you take the stairs down to The Cellar it is a whole different story. The space is large and has a well stocked whiskey bar with some of the most fascinating cocktails I've seen made. You can also sit at one of the many tables to dine. My favorite aspect of The Cellar is the spur beer cellar. It's unreal! Beer and whiskey lovers, enjoy!"}
{"text":"You guys rock!!!! Great food, great service, great drinks, great atmosphere!!! You guys know what you're doing, a true destination for those looking for a great time in Uptown!"}
{"text":"Word of advice- order a beer or wine first and then order cocktails. This was our 3rd time here and cocktails take a long long time so plan ahead and get beer or wine first and order cocktail at same time. Food has come out before our cocktails twice.  The best food items so far- Tuna tartare is amazing, truffle fries, charred salad, Brussels, and burger. Tacos- ok. Hanger- ok.  Service has been great"}
{"text":"After we sat down it took 15 minutes to get a waiters attention. As he greeted us, he told us it would be a 35 minute wait for cocktails. We ordered a flatbread and 20 minutes later were told they were out of flatbread.  I ordered a burger and asked them to add tomato. No tomato in the kitchen apparently.  Shrimp and grits half the portion size as last time. \" they downsized the portion\"   The portions are tiny and the service poor."}
{"text":"The best Ribeye I have ever had!!! I've eaten at \"the best steakhouses\" all over the country and this by far was the best hands down"}
{"text":"I want to give more than a one star because the food was very good. Unfortunately, all our main course food came out at very different times. As good as the drink selection is we didn't have a chance to enjoy the drinks with our food. We ordered drinks when we ordered our food and they happened to come out after we were all done with our food. With the waiter giving us a bad excuse that the bar was backed up.... 30+ minutes to make a simple drink. Our same waiter also poured our beers then took the bottle and began to sniff it uncontrollably to get a \"taste\" of the beer. It was very unprofessional. Food was very good service was horrible."}
{"text":"Went to check out The Cellar tonight for a couple of reasons. I am SO glad we did. We walked down the stairs to find a laid back place that felt like history and mystery had combined in the best of ways in this sexy speak easy. First, our server Laura took such great care of us. We had the charcuterie board with amazing cheeses, the wild boar, honeycomb, and fig preserves. From there, it just kept getting better.   Brussel sprouts, Truffle Mac & Cheese, Charred Romain Salad, Lemon Risotto...all of it--just fantastic. The star of the whole table though, hands down (or shall I say \"hooves down\") was the candied jalapeno bacon. Really. If you eat nothing else in Charlotte, you must eat this.  We sure did. All of it, without the least trace of decency or shame. It's that good.  We went on to finish off our table of sharable delectables with the french toast. Honestly, we were not in the LEAST bit hungry, but we somehow managed to devour that plate like something out of National Geographic.  So now for the reasons we came: First, a local recommended it as a \"must do\" for our stay. But second and most compelling, we read a review that spoke of an experience we just had a hard time believing could even be true. So we went to satisfy our curiosity. Without going into specifics, we pleasantly found just the opposite of the review we had read (which incidentally, cracked us up--MUCH). When you go--and hopefully you will go SOON--ask for our favorites--Amanda and Dave who make it happen with knowledge, skill, and craftsmanship behind the bar, Laura who we mentioned is an excellent, gracious, attentive server, and the manager Taylor who made sure we were enjoying ourselves and made us feel extremely welcome (even in our yoga pants)--like we had walked into his living room and were his new, close friends.  Overall, I have to say, this place was a highlight of our trip! We did not take the tour of the actual cellar which I'm sure would have been fascinating. But really, I'm glad we didn't. Because now we have a great excuse to come back the next time we're in town--as if we needed anything more than that jalapeno bacon. My only regret here--5 stars on Yelp are just not enough. Thank you, Amanda, Dave, Laura, and Taylor. You have 3 new fans."}
{"text":"This is all time favorite spot of my husband and I. The tuna tartare is some of the best I've ever had. For starters, we love the freshly made waffle cones and truffle fries, the oysters with the delicious \"lovin\" or the buttery deliciousness that soaks up perfectly with the bread. Even though I'm not a fan of brussel sprout, Chef Fred has won me over with this dish. For main dishes, I love the saffron fettuccine and my husband loves the scallops. Really...you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Tried to eat at the Wooden Vine down the street at 8:30 and they had closed the kitchen, so we wandered down to the Cellar, and boy were we glad. We picked out a draft beer from their iPad drink menu, and ordered the recommended Truffle Fries and Waffle Cones. Wow. The presentation was beautiful and the taste didn't let us down. Honey Sriracha Chicken and Coconut Shrimp in a homemade waffle cone?? yes please!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service, a great variety of food including my favorite paparedellu and appetizers including the mac & cheese, can't beat it!"}
{"text":"The Best! Hands down my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. The atmosphere, the drinks, the service, all amazing. Also, probably the best steak I've ever had."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting from out of town and came in about 30 minutes before close. We were greeted with a warm welcome and a strong recommendation for drink types we typically wouldn't order. We decided to trust the server and weren't disappointed. The staff was friendly and we were very well taken care of. If I ever find myself back I  Charlotte I'll be sure to stop here again."}
{"text":"Aaahmazing food and the atmosphere is so cool. Dark and romantic w delicious drinks, super attentive staff--the manager even comped us an appetizer for waiting on drinks from the bar."}
{"text":"I went here for drinks and late night food. There was a great beer selection and the cocktails were phenomenal. I enjoyed the smoked pack margarita. I had chargrilled oysters, scallops, and the charcuterie plate and was really impressed.  Definitely a place to return to and I would recommend."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner (my treat). Thursday night, around 7:30-8 pm. Had to wait about 30 minutes for our table, but went upstairs to the bar to get drinks. We had the cheese plate, filet, tacos and mac n cheese. For dessert the s'more! So good and the service was excellent. I've told all my friends to try!"}
{"text":"Great service!  Great beer selection. Must have a hundred tv screens here. Great place!"}
{"text":"Everything about the Cellar at Duckworth's is just outstanding: the ambiance, service, cocktails, dinner, dessert...everything! I've been to the Cellar twice and have tried a bunch of different things, including:  - Candied Jalapeno Bacon - Caramelized Brussels - Char-Grilled Oysters (YES) - Charred Artisan Romaine (I have never loved a salad more) - Pastrami Marinated Hanger Steak - Shrimp & Grits - Campfire Almond S'more (A MUST) - Corn Flake Crusted French Toast  Every single bite was delicious. The only thing stopping me from re-ordering the same meal over and over is the fact that I want to try more items from the menu.  Go to the Cellar, grab a cocktail, and enjoy."}
{"text":"Went with a friend while in town for a business meeting.  We were seated in the last booth near the beer cellar.    The service was great and we were treated like  rockstars. The choose your own cheese and charcuterie plate was delicious.   My friend got the brisket burger and I got the cheese grits with shrimp.  Both were amazing!    Extra credit for the manager giving us a fantastic tour of the beer cellar.  A beer lovers dream!"}
{"text":"Best place we've been in Charlotte!!! Bar tenders and our server were fantastic. The dude who seems to lead the bar (maybe more) was very impressive with his mixology skills. AND then there's the food! We loved the charbroiled oysters, the shrimp and grits, the brussel sprouts, and the bacon cheeseburger with fries!!! Good god!! For drinks, they had fantastic takes on classics and some creative newcomers. We started with Negronis.... LEGIT!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately we overheard the bartender making several racist remarks about our party. Food was more or less mediocre.Have had better. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try this place for months and don't know why I waited so long! Everything about this restaurant is amazing - the location (walkable from just about anywhere in Uptown), decor, ambiance, drinks and food. I went with a friend on a Sunday night without a reservation but we were seated immediately at the high bar in the middle of the restaurant. It was fine for the two of us as we had open seats next to us, but might have been a little cramped if the table had been full.   We started with the truffle Mac and cheese and the waffle cone trio. The Mac and cheese came out very quickly and was incredible; rich, decadent, filling. We were glad we split it, there's a lot of food! The waffle cones came out shortly thereafter and were just as fabulous. I liked the chicken bacon Sirracha and the coconut shrimp the best.   For our main meals, we split both the scallops and the chicken breast. Both were delicious. The chorizo on both dishes was a fun addition and everything was cooked to perfection. My only complaint is that I wanted to lay down at the table because I was so stuffed!   We also had the Lumen IPA on draft and a beer recommended to us by our server from the cellar. Both were good. My only complaint and the reason I am rating 4/5 stars is that I was hoping for out of this world drink recommendations, and our waiter seemed hung up on two beers he had already recommended. Overall it was an excellent experience and I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience. What was amazing you ask? EVERYTHING!! Service, craft cocktails, TRUFFLE MAC.... and if you want a melt in your mouth steak...here's your place. If I could give it 100 stars...still not enough. Well done, Bravo!!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night around 6:30 with a party of 6, only had to wait 45 minutes for a great table and a server quickly came and greeted us with water and a menu description. Highlights included the cocktails (we tried a ton of them) and you should too. Food highlights were the Mac and cheese, the tuna Tare Tare which had a Mexican twist to it, and the scallops which we ordered two of because we fought over them. We also over ordered by getting the steak as well and it was just really well done. The vibe of the restaurant was great. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The beer selection is incredible. Food and service was so-so. Unless you specifically go for the beer options, I would skip this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon The Cellar this past Saturday. Since then, I have been going back and forth about writing a review. I mean, I am not normally a selfish person. BUT, I don't know if I am ready just yet to share this place with the world! My love for all ya'll won out!  How to get to The Cellar?--Walk into Duckworths and go immediately downstairs. From there, you will be greeted by a hostess at a stand. She will ask if you are here for The Cellar. Once you say yes, she will slide back (yes, slide) the huge doors to this cool spot!   The Cellar is modeled after a 1920s Speak Easy. Hence the slightly hidden spot. It is dimly lit with exposed brick everywhere. Fairly small space to keep that speak easy feel intact. All the waiters/bartenders wear suspenders and bowties. It just feels so genuine.   We grabbed two spots at the bar and were immediately handled a Tablet with all the drinks. Both my husband and I got a cocktail from the menu because all of them looked fantastic. After speaking with the bartender all night, I think the cocktails here are where it's at. Strong mixologoy game going on at The Cellar!  I ordered the Blind Peach and my husband ordered The East Village (basically a spin on The Manhattan). Our bartender took alot of time and care in crafting these two drinks, including topping mine with a hand picked flower petal. Both drinks were absolutely amazing! He told us that for the cherry in my husbands East Village, that he hand pits all the cherries with this pitter he made out of a fork. Then the cherries are soaked in some spices and liquor (there was a bunch of stuff he listed). I wish I remembered our bartenders name, as we was incredible! I got the impression that he was the head bartender.....awesome stuff coming from behind the bar!  Additionally, we ordered the Truffle Mac and Cheese. Great portion and it was purely delish! Super creamy with that strong truffle taste. There was also pancetta (or it may have been bacon) in it as well. Can't speak to anything else on the menu. But, based on the mac n cheese alone, the kitchen is pumping out equal caliber to the bar!  I can't wait to go back here and check out more of what The Cellar has to offer!"}
{"text":"Excellent \"waffle cone\" trio inclusive of tuna, coconut shrimp and siracha honey chicken. The blackberry Moscow mule was very tasty with a hint of smokey flavor. Definitely strong and worth the price. Only complaint is the high tables' chairs feel unsteady and aren't the most comfortable. Would prefer to sit at a booth next time. Otherwise, it was a fun, speakeasy style experience!"}
{"text":"The food, the atmosphere and the service beyond excellent!! Hand crafted specialty drinks a real treat.  This is a great hidden surprise below Duckworths.  One of our favorites all around, can't wait to go back. The Moscow mule was fantastic, the filet mignon perfect."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Took my girlfriend here for a pre Valentine's day dinner. The Cellar is definitely an upscale place to bring a date for an intimate setting. We didn't make reservations so we had about an hour wait...which was okay because we just headed upstairs for a few beers.  When we were sat down it was immediately apparent that they were extremely understaffed. Someone mentioned that they were not expecting to be so busy (even though the hostess said that the are fully booked for the month). ?? We didn't let this bother us because Darren, our waiter was incredible. He was split between back of house and waiting but continually took his time to not make us feel rushed. He even took time to show us the beer room and take some pictures of us throughout the resteraunt. Darren is a true professional.  The food....we had one of the cheese plates with the gouda, boar meat and prosciutto. We also got the lemon risotto for an appetizer. The main course was the grouper and a steak. All of the food was outstanding and exceeded our expectations.  This place is on the expensive side but the quality is there to match. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Let me start with........I loved the speakeasy like atmosphere of this cellar restaurant.   My wife and I had booked a reservation a week In advance for a Friday night and had to settle for a 5:30 time slot.......must be a hot spot I assumed.   Our waiter was extremely helpful and suggested we try their signature Old Fashion that that prepare and then age again for 3 months in an oak barrel. We are both big Old Fashion aficionados so recommendation accepted.........lets just say, I am trying to find a location for a bourbon barrel in our house!  I had scoped out the menu and planned to try their charred octopus and a pasta, but they were out......hhhhmmmmm......Friday night at 5:30? Oh well. We shared small plates; Grilled romaine salad, Tuna tartar, Pastrami marinated hanger steak and the butter basted scallops. Enjoyed all of our selections and found them to be generally generous portions.  Oh yeah, we dined for 2 1/2 hours and when we were leaving observed several tables for 2 still unoccupied. Would return (still want to try the octopus) but would suggest booking reservations well in advance unless you are early bird diners by nature."}
{"text":"This place has really good drinks, phenomenal customer service by all the staff. That being said it is the food and the drinks are pricey so prepare your wallet."}
{"text":"5 stars, ten times over.  Was looking for a new place to go for dinner on a double date night, and a friend recommended this new place to us.  Between the four of us, we tried 11 of the dishes (practically half of the menu)! Literally, everything put in front of us was amazing. Everything tasted fresh and was full of flavor. The tapas plates that stood out were the truffle mac & cheese & fried oysters. The entrees that stood out were the 14 oz ribeye & shrimp and grits. Dessert: get the s'more.  Atmosphere and ambiance are unparalleled to any restaurant in Charlotte. Underground, speakeasy vibe, dim lighting, jazz music, knowledgable staff.  The craft cocktails match both the food and the vibe. Made to perfection.  We also got to do a quick tour of the beer cooler before it was stocked. Very cool.  Amazing first experience at The Cellar. Already recommended it to all of my friends. Can't wait to go back and try out the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Drinks were good but not much selection. It's there own creativity but not creative at all. Bar tender was rude and nodded head when she was asked to create something not on menu."}
{"text":"Unbelievably slow service. Mediocre and way overpriced food. Choice is good but having so many beers on tap that you have to scroll through an iPad for an hour to find something you want is lame.   A friend of mine from out of town was staying in a hotel downtown for a work conference and I met him at the cellar for dinner. I was embarrassed that this was his only impression of Charlotte.   We showed up at 7:45. The hostess told us we'd have a table in about 30 minutes. After waiting over an hour, I had to remind the hostess we were still waiting for a table even though more than 5 tables were open. By the time we finally sat down, the waitress had to explained somewhere around 82 cocktail specials before saying she'd take our order in a minute and disappeared for at least 15. We finally ordered food after 9pm. At 10:30 we had to ask the hostess where the food was. She brought out one side dish. We didn't get the rest of the meal until 11.   If it weren't for the good company and a decent sense of humor it would've been a miserable experience.   Never going back to the cellar. Terrible."}
{"text":"I love this spot. Dark and intimate. The food and the drinks are amazing. Great date spot or fun place to grab drinks with a friend. It's very small and usually packed so don't be surprised if you bump arms with your neighbor."}
{"text":"I first visited The Cellar at Duckworth's quite a while ago as I was frantically searching for a place to seat 18 people... the DAY OF.  Surprisingly and thankfully, I was able secure us a large table (stool seating in the middle) for a team member's farewell party.  Since then, I've frequented this joint several times, usually to meet friends/colleagues for after-dinner drinks.  The Cellar is located underneath Duckworth's Sports Bar and sports a much different vibe than it's counterpart upstairs.  It's a cozy, speak-easyish vibe with good dim lighting and old-school decor.  It's a separate restaurant from upstairs, in that it opens only at 5pm and don't forget your credit cards here because they won't be able to get it for you before they open upstairs (I learned this the hard way).  Service is usually pretty good, except for when they had 1 server for an entire table of 18 the first time around.  Their many creative drinks as well as basic liquors can be ordered on their fancy iPad menu.  With a speakeasy vibe and fancy iPad menu also comes a speakeasy price, similar to that in NYC.  Drinks here are not the cheapest on the block, but you definitely get what you pay for.  I only got food the first time around and from what I remember, everyone was pretty happy with my choice of restaurant (thanks Yelp!) and we all left with happy stomachs.  I personally enjoyed the truffle fries and the tuna tartare, which came with a bit of chili oil for a kick, guacamole, and wonton chips.  Also good were the scallops.  You can't really go wrong with any of the food here and it's definitely way better than your average bar food.  I recommended this place to an old college friend who was in Charlotte for a while and got kudos for it - he called it he best restaurant in Charlotte!  Will continue to frequent this spot until I finally get to leave my travel assignment in Charlotte :)"}
{"text":"Soooo good! Hubby and I were able to do last minute date night so we did not have a reservation. It was a Friday night and we waited about an hour to be seated; luckily we were able to have drinks upstairs while we waited. We had the tacos, steak and Mac n cheese... my mouth is still watering. It was definitely worth the wait but I suggest making a reservation ahead of time. It was completely packed, we enjoyed the ambiance and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Great dinner, our second visit to Cellar's. We travel once a year to Charlotte for the Panthers, and Cellar's is quickly becoming a tradition once a year as well.   Our server Patrick was astounding, exactly what you'd expect and want for great service. Nice recommendations, stopped by time to time to ask how the food was going, and did something no server has done before --- shook our hand at the end and said it was nice to meet us -- something that was unique and stayed with me.  Dinner highlights: The charbroiled oysters are for any oyster, garlic, butter loving person, (I'm thinking this is a new tradition too). As may be the tuna tartrare, chunky fresh tuna, not overdressed which is a huge pet peeve of mine, and good guac to go with it. The grouper with pesto rice was a little bit heavy on the salt, but otherwise very tasty. The fried peppers were a little underwhelming for me, didn't remind me of Spain as much as I wanted it to -- but that's a personal preference, my boyfriend loved them!  Also, if you like to imbibe and with the name \" Cellar's\" you should know they have tons for you. I want to say it was over 300 bottled beers, a few drafts, and about 10 or so crafted cocktails -- my smokey margarita was great.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The service was incredible, Darren was amazing! The hostess said he had just served a large party so our group of 7 offered to wait but I'm glad we didn't. He did an amazing job. Everything we ate was delicious, but the mac and cheese and smores was something I'll never forget!"}
{"text":"Because we are not noble, thou shall not pass. Apparently, it's unacceptable to stand and have a drink at the cellar at Duckworths. Douche treatment for many of the people waiting to come in. It wasn't even packed, they just don't allow standing and drinking. Well, thou shalt not return. Cheers to the king"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. We have been twice now and have experienced amazing food and service both times. We love trying new tapas and cocktails. The cocktail selection is AMAZING. They have so many to choose from. Our favorite tapas include the brussel sprouts, Mac and cheese, duck and fig flatbread, and truffle fries. The only thing we weren't a fan of is the candied bacon. It was a little too spicy for our preference but if you like jalapeños and bacon you would like it! Highly recommend for date night or special occasion. It's delicious."}
{"text":"Loves this place! The food was unique and very tasty. The drinks were well presented and the atmosphere was very inviting. I would definitely go back again and again!"}
{"text":"5 for the food, 3 for the service.  By far best Mac and cheese I've ever had. The tacos and waffle cones are also great.   The ambiance is great too, hard to read the menu with the lighting but it's still very nice.  The bartender seemed like me and my two friends were bothering her every time we ordered something. The other workers were awesome just the bartender we ended up with really seemed annoyed. I've been other times with better service and i will go back."}
{"text":"Great experience in the basement cellar with loads of collections of bottled and draft beer, delicious oysters, truffle fries and pizza.  Expansive wine selection and over all good food and drink. Small and noisy due to brick walls but it was worth it!"}
{"text":"\"Everything's better down here\", the bartender said as he greeted our party.   The entrance of Duckworth's is bright, busy, TV-riddled (and a great sports bar), but just down the dark stairs and through a large wood cellar door is a darkened space with beautiful brick walls dotted with glowing sconces, heavy, bar-height wood tables and servers who know their stuff.  There's the obvious Prohibition speakeasy reference, strengthened by the best Gastro pub and cocktail bar in the southern US."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd write a 5 star review at all, due to being very picky about food & service. I definitely didn't think a 5 star review would happen in the Duckworths building, but that was before a friend told me about what lies underneath the main floor (of good beer but mediocre food).   Same owner as upstairs, but a completely different world downstairs in The Cellar. Intimate & a little dark, but not in a bad way.  Plenty of servers checking in, and a Manager who personally walks around & makes sure everyone is more than satisfied.   That's all nice, but the big deal for me was the food itself. I made the comment on the first night (we went two nights in a row) that it was the best food I've had in Charlotte, & I've eaten at probably 30 restaurants during many business trips.   The oyster app is a must get. Oysters that are fresh, cooked just right, & with an amazing sauce that you can soak up with the included bread strips.   Two of us got the seared scallops on the first night, with chorizo & corn mixture & small portions of several different sauces. Wish I could remember all the ingredients, but all I can say is the flavor was incredible when all mixed together. Again, scallops were fresh & cooked perfectly.    The second night I got the grouper on a bed of pesto rice with seared shallots & candied carrots.  I grew up on the coast of Florida eating fish right off the boats on a daily basis. To say I'm picky about fish is like saying that it's unpleasant to have my foot run over by a car.  Same as above..... Fresh and cooked just right.  It flaked apart with very little effort & was nice and moist inside.   It's been a while since I was this enthused about a restaurant & I thought I was just getting jaded, but The Cellar reminded me that there are still great discoveries out there."}
{"text":"Had high expectations so perhaps mistake number one...is it asking too much to sit down and be greeted by bartender and have a beverage as you peruse the menu?  Kinda felt like I was an interruption as opposed to a guest.  Surprised as I asked for feedback on menu (as I leaned toward lighter fare ) that she never shared how \"heavy\" the preparation for their rendition of shrimp and grits... How about when customers inquire about scallops, fish, ahi tuna at least mention the density of other options---and can we hold back on the sodium please!  Mac and cheese was yummy but when the main course is picked through you might want to invest a tad more energy into your customers vs everything ok---yep ok but is that your aim?maqs   If you want heavy food, dark space and bartenders more focused on tomorrow's prep/glass cleaning vs the customer then this should top your list."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with friends the food was amazing and waiter was really helpful! I tried the shrimp and grits, waffle cones, scallops, tacos, and truffle fries. Each item was worth five stars, love this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were deciding between this and 131 Main for dinner. We chose this because we had never been before and heard great things.  From the second we walked in a knew we made the wrong choice. The score was 88. Not what I hope to see at nice restaurant. We got cocktails, a cheese and meat plate, the burger, the ribeye, and the Mac and cheese, and everything we had was barely okay.  The cocktails were okay, but overpriced and nothing special.   I was expecting a really great meal, and neither of us liked anything we had. I don't have very high standards for food, I like almost everything, and I haven't had a meal that bad in a long time. Really disappointed. We expected a lot more out of this place for the prices"}
{"text":"The rule at The Cellar seems to be that regardless of how many tables are open, walk in guests are seated at the bar. This was no problem for us as we arrived at 5 when they opened, but I can easily see how people could get upset at not being able to be seated even though so many tables were left empty.   There is an extensive drink list that you can browse using their iPads, though most beers are by the bottle instead of on tap. Per the bartender, all ingredients used in drinks are made in house.   Food ordered:  - Caramelized Brussels - ORDER THIS. This was the best of dishes we ordered by far.  - House made waffle cones - To be honest, I was a bit underwhelmed. It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't order again.  - Grilled shrimp & old mill cheddar oats - Similar situation here. Main reason for the disappointment? There were a total of 3 shrimp pieces in the dish and the sauce to grits ratio made the dish a bit too salty.   TLDR: I'd come for the drinks instead of the food."}
{"text":"It was our first time there. I was looking for a place to go with a group and was checking this out. When we walked in I really liked the atmosphere, its a smaller place, kind of dark but as it got crowded it got really loud. I think if we went back with a group we wouldn't be able to talk to each other. It is definitely not a cheap place, my drink, Blackberry Julep was very good but was more than any of the food we ordered. The service was great. We ordered small plates to share instead of an entree. We had the Waffle Cones (1 chicken, 1 shrimp, 1 tuna) what was in the cone was good but the cone you can really only eat the top as it gets thicker you can't even chew it. Next was the Truffle Mac n Cheese (wasn't like any mac n cheese we have had before) but was AWESOME.  I would go back just for this. Then we had the 3 Tacos (very small 1 octopus, 1 pulled chicken, 1 pork belly) We also liked all of these.  We never get dessert but I had to try the Corn Flake Crust French Toast (unlike the small plates this was HUGE. Vanilla ice cream with cinnamon, the french toast covered with Bananas Foster with a few berries and some whipped cream) Very good, I actually took the rest of the French Toast home minus the ice cream and ate it for breakfast the next day. They will explain that everything takes time but I really liked having the time in between each plate so wasn't a problem for us. Would go back and probably try an entree next time."}
{"text":"Amazing. Food was fantastic and the service was on point! Great overall experience!! I would definitely recommend this place and we will be back!"}
{"text":"In town for a Regional Meeting and Duckworth's was recommended by my son who works in downtown. Watched some BBall, had a few beers and tried 3 different flat breads with colleagues. Service was great. Nice after hour chill location.   I have a food allergy and they were very helpful with my food selection."}
{"text":"I love this place. Favorite place to eat in uptown. Fun for a date or with friends. The cellar is an awesome environment with great drinks. The food is also amazing. I'm a big fan of the Mac and cheese and Brussels sprouts and you can't go wrong with the steak. I've never had anything there that I didn't like. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Unbelievable...  1. In customer service the first answer that comes from a service mouth is NEVER no.  Don't get Shannon as your waiter.  I asked if they have avocado so I could possibly order as a side and Shannon's answer was NO.  They have guacamole but not avocado.  How about saying, I can definitely check and I will be right back, however the answer was NO. 2.  Irish mule?? Shannon's answer NO, it's not on the menu. 3.  We ordered a drink for a gentleman (it was his birthday)  who arrived with 8 guest who sat at a long high top table next to us.  We thought it was nice gesture.  Shannon then came back to my husband and asked what we ordered, my husband replied, then Shannon mimicked.   4.  Husband steak ordered NO pink, it came pink. 5.  General manager came to see how our night was going at the very end.  We explained being a business owner ourselves that customer service is #1.  As we continued into detailed he said he understood, he would have got me the avocado and the Irish mule.. But that was it.  As the last line of defense this manager did not save the game. LOST!  After more then 200.00 this guy didn't offer a thing.  No drink on us, no desert, nothing!  I was so perplexed.  Restaurant business is hard enough to service.  If you ever want to go here, ask for Taylor.  Hopefully he is the manager by the time you get there.  This guy is educated, well mannered and I know he would of handled this situating like a charm.  If there is one reason we would ever think of returning it would be because of Taylor on staff and a different manger working.  This was our  first visit.  We came here after visiting from Lake Norman, wanted to experience something different and followed reviews.   First impression, the cellar was a very cool atmosphere.  We would have loved to experience this place as a date night but it was a random stop by.  They have to fix this!"}
{"text":"Great service! Amazing food and drinks. Everything was spot on. Perfect place for a romantic date or intimate gathering with friends. Prices fit the quality of the food. Highly recommend the duck ragu, char-grilled oysters and scallops. Also, the cellar margarita was refreshing and delicious."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to have a date. The mood, the lighting and deco are perfect atmosphere for a date. We will definitely come back, the food and atmosphere and service all made our night."}
{"text":"First the negatives: Parking not great. Waited for hostess for too long and not very friendly. Tapas style with some mains. Food delivery was not timed well at all.   The good: Great beer selection. Candied jalapenos bacon:wow! Tomahawk steak wow! Mixed drinks perfect! Friend had duck pasta of some sort:also great.  Responded to allergy concern in less than 24 hours prior to dining.   A must on my next visit to the area."}
{"text":"Visited August 22nd  We were considerably excited to visit the Cellar at Duckworth's -- probably the most anticipated opening of the past year for us. Perhaps it was because we were pining for it for so long, but the experience did not live up to expectations.  We arrived soon after they opened and asked to be seated at the bar, which is common for us. The air was not yet circulating, and a distinctive whiff of 'bathroom' was evident. Not many smiles as we arrived either.  We usually enjoy sitting at the bar, conversing with the bartender and receiving attentive service. In this case, the bartender was overly bragadocious, consistently talking up the chef, the beer selection and the restaurant in general. In fact, it was his own boasting about the Yelp score and the backstory of the one bad review that caused me to write this review. As a tip, don't denigrate the people who leave bad reviews - it comes off as defensive. For whatever reason, he insisted on shaking his cocktail creations right in front of us each time, even though there were areas where he could have stood that wouldn't have been in front of anyone. Plus, the bar back was loudly chopping ice at the end of the bar for a long time. For us, the service was just too much and cloying... made for an uncomfortable experience.   One of the biggest reasons we were excited to go the Cellar was the beer. We heard it was to be an elevated beer experience, with access to rare beers and a higher quality selection. We found the evening's draft list to be fairly \"meh.\" While it was true that the selections were lesser known and less often seen in Charlotte, that doesn't mean it was necessarily a great list. Add to that the fact that their beer cooler is not yet available and they had no bottles on-hand. The biggest reason we visited was for the beer and it was not what we expected.  How about the food? The best dish by far was the tuna tartar, which was truly awesome. Almost worth coming back for by itself, served with guacamole and a generous portion for the price. However, the other two small plates we got were below average. The cheese plate was laughably small for the price, with very modest portions of cheese and the typical accoutrements. The smoked salmon flatbread was wafer-thin and somewhat tasteless ('the chef smokes it in-house' the bartender bragged). After such a strong start with the tuna, we found the rest to be fairly pedestrian. We decided to forgo additional small plates and asked for the check.  Will we be back? Probably, but not until they get their act together. And we won't be sitting at the bar. Oh, and like another who left a review, my wife's bag was stained by whatever was near the floor at the bar. She had to throw it away - the stain is still wet?  Atmosphere - 2.5 out of 5 Beer- 2,5 out of 5 Food - 2 out of 5 Overall - 2 out of 5"}
{"text":"This place is a 4-5 star if you are a person who enjoy pork. We (hubby and I) personally don't so it's pretty hard to enjoy and trust food preparation at most places. I discovered this place via a rare Sunday Gold Yelp Elite badge event. I was not able to really try everything offered due to pork being in 90% of the offerings. I was told about the ability to leave off the pork on several dishes that were signature dishes which lead us back here while in the area for DateNight out. We had this Trio dish where you get 3 waffle cones one with different fillings. The chicken and shrimp were amazing the tuna was so so. Our server also suggested the tuna app which wasn't that memorable.  The Mac and cheese minus the pork was yummy  I mean the smoke flavor of the smoked cheese as well as the creamy texture full of flavor. My husband ordered a pasta dish with duck and I'm a big Donald Duck, Daffy Duck and Duck Tale fan so I don't eat my buddies but when I tell you I took a piece of this pasta and all the other inclusions and the flavor was undeniable. My husband really enjoyed that dish with the duck I enjoyed it minus the duck .  The dessert menu wasn't appetizing so we opted out of dessert and headed out to another venue for dessert. Not sure I'll be rushing back here but if you like pork definitely check this place out. It's also very cute and intimate for DateNight even if it's only for some cocktails  at the bar. The lighting is low and the staff are suspendered down with Big smiles."}
{"text":"Fantastic cocktails, delectable small plates and romantic ambience make The Cellar a marvelous date night!  We tried a bunch of small plates and shared everything--1. Tacos--chicken, octopus, pork belly--w/ pork belly as my fave w/ smoky sweet meat. (We probably should have had 2 orders for 4 people.)  2. Waffle cones with chicken, tuna and shrimp--definitely my fave appetizer! Think sweet, umami flavors & presented in a little waffle cone rack. 3. Truffle fries because you can't go wrong, their dipping sauce is a balsamic aioli that's worth seconds. 4. Flatbread with salmon and capers, pear, marscapone flat bread-lite and savory. 5. Tuna tartare that melts in your mouth-- like sashimi cut tuna with the full fatty goodness making your tastebuds dance! Another favorite! The cocktails were impressive--tried the Blackberry Mezcal mule--intrigued by the smoky tequila & sweet berries. The dessert we all 4 shared was the CAMPFIRE ALMOND S'MORE-dragon's milk ganache, marshmallow puff, graham cracker. Definitely worth the calories & you need 4 people to demolish the rich ganache, made in house! I think they had good service especially considering how crowded the place was on a weekend. I feel like this is a much needed addition to the foodie scene. I will return to try the other plates!"}
{"text":"It was good, but not sure it's worth the money.  We ordered several things, and I think most of it was just average for a place like that.  My personal favorite were the truffle fries, maybe just because I love fries, but nothing else really stood out that much.  I will say the waffle cones were different and interesting, but again, just ok for us.  Loved the ambiance.  Ordered a few different cocktails, which were good, but for the price, should of either been bigger....or packed more of a punch."}
{"text":"A hidden gem within the city. The selection of Whiskeys and spirits is exemplary. They serve absinthe using near traditional techniques. I say \"near traditional\" since they don't use cubes but instead use a slow drip of cold water over an ice earthy brown sugar. A nice glass of Brothers Vilgalys on artisan ice is a great way to wind down from a long week. Many other excellent Rye selections such as Templeton's. The bartenders such as Amanda are proud of their craft and will be happy to explain more on the drinks. The GM Charles is a great guy who is quite knowledgeable himself of all the spirits in stock and makes neat recommendations. The cellar has a nice rustic decor with the whole Tesla era long filament bulb decor combined with an old wine cellar wood and bridge metal stools. Definitely looking forward to future visits at this place!"}
{"text":"Ambiance/Drinks/Food all very good. The beer selection is also amazing. Ask for a tour of the place."}
{"text":"Loved all the tapas esp the waffle cone app and Mac n cheese. All fish was fresh n tasty! Great atmosphere, shared all apps & entrees with a large group to try everything. Drinks on point !"}
{"text":"The Cellar has an elegant speakeasy style and what a great find in downtown Charlotte. I believe they've only been open for less than a year so they may be still flying under the radar a bit. Food prices are very reasonable for the classy environment. The caramelized brussel sprouts and truffle fries were both under $10 and their 32 oz tomahawk bone in ribeye was big enough for two people and a solid price at $68. All the food was amazing and would have liked to try the house made waffle cones but the brussels paired better with the bone in ribeye. Everybody from the guys behind the bar to the restaurant manager were very warm and welcoming. I wasn't dressed formally enough compared to the other patrons in the restaurant, but it didn't feel uncomfortable at all. The burgers and black grouper entree looked really good and gives me a reason to come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"They do take their cocktails very seriously here, I will give them that.  But, the fact that it's below/affiliated with the Applebee's of Charlotte (Duckworth's) just takes something away for me."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Uptown Charlotte. Being from New Orleans, this place would be fantastic if it was in New Orleans, which is saying a lot."}
{"text":"After our great initial impression on Tuesday, we were back in last night for dinner this time. The food was very good, adding to my high opinion of this place all around.  We started with the three tacos - you get one pork belly, one braised chicken and one poached octopus. The waitress recommended to start light to dark, starting with the octopus and ending with the pork belly. The octopus was really good, a lighter/white meat. And the pork belly was so flavorful. Those were a good choice.  For my meal, I went with the scallops, which come with currants, cauliflower, turmeric and chorizo. I really liked the chunks of chorizo thrown in, and there was both a cauliflower puree and mini cauliflower. There were 3-4 medium sized scallops and they weren't too buttery or oily, which is usually my complaint. My husband got the cellar burger, which was another win. To differentiate a burger, you've gotta use a good cheese or throw on some great toppings; this was a little of both. The gruyere cheese was amazing, combined with the onion jam and japaleno bacon. Great combination of tastes.  We also split the caramelized brussels. I wasn't as crazy about this small plate because there was too much liquid oozing out. The smoked pancetta was a good addition but these were almost too heavy overall."}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks.  I love a good speakeasy!  I couldn't decide on a drink so I just told my waiter to let the bartender make whatever he felt, bartender's choice.  What a great decision!  They made me a drink that was both aesthetically beautiful and tasty!  I was very happy with the service.  The server knew his scotch which made the men at my table very happy!   They have an extensive beer selection but the cocktails are the star of the show.  The food is amazing, I highly recommend the lamb.  It was seasoned perfectly.  I ordered my lamb medium and it was more medium rare but the flavor was so good, I didn't mind.  Would definitely recommend for a good date night or even a good double date option.  The setting is very intimate."}
{"text":"Had some drinks at the bar while we waited for a table.  The bartender mixed me up a drink with bitters to calm my upset stomach and hubby enjoyed an East Village.  Food was amazing!  Shared some small plates of truffle fries and Brussels.  Ordered the grouper that came with pesto rice and maple glazed carrots and artichoke hearts.  The fish was so well seasoned and cooked and everything was delicious.  We weren't too hungry so the portions were perfect to share.    Atmosphere dim and lively."}
{"text":"This is must try pkace. We had grilles salad scallops grouper meat and cheese tray and bananas foster all to die for our waitress was Fabulous the manager greeted us  We came early good time to get a seat by 730 this place was packed. I recommend a must see."}
{"text":"I think this might be my new favorite restaurant in Charlotte! We went here for a friend's birthday celebration and there were 7 of us on a Thursday from 5pm - 8pm. Our server Darren was wonderful - knowledgeable, fun, helpful, and with a great memory (he got all of our names right after just telling him one time!).  Charles, the GM, gave us a tour of the beer cellar and it was impressive! He was also fantastically knowledgeable and we really enjoyed talking with him about beer.  The food was amazing as well!! We ordered several apps - my favorite was the Brussels sprouts! I had the hangar steak for my entree and O.M.G. it was delicious!!! I can't wait to return here to try more of the wonderful dishes and I know this restaurant is going to be successful!  Thanks, Duckworth's for making this such a special outing!"}
{"text":"Came here and fell in love! The ambiance of this place is amazing, with a true cellar feel in a modern style. The waiter was extremely attentive and friendly, suggesting some kick ass drinks for both men and women and great food options! I got the lemon ginger drink which was excellent and not too strong for my taste. My date and I had truffle mac and cheese and the steak flatbread, both which were out of this world!! Usually I am used to going to a tapas place and each getting 2-3 tapas per person but 2 tapas between the 2 of us was plenty! I hope to visit this place again soon!"}
{"text":"Met friends for a week night dinner. The restaurant wasn't packed but it was busy.  It's tapas style yet you can order an entree. I selected the truffle mac and cheese and the scallops.  The truffle mac was creamy and flavorful. The pancetta pieces added a nice smokey flavor and the gouda was a delightful addition to the dish. I would definitely order this again!  The scallops were seasoned & cooked perfectly. The dish was accompanied with currents, cauliflower and chorizo. The chorizo disturbed the flavor of the dish, in my opinion. I felt like it took away from the the scallops. By itself, the chorizo was tasty...just not together.  I paired it with a Queen Charlotte mojito, which wasn't light on the rum (Amen)."}
{"text":"Big fan of Duckworths. They have a great location in uptown, and it's our go-to lunch spot on fridays. Buffalo chicken pizza is amazing, and make sure you get a side of the tots. Their beer selection is just as amazing. Too many to choose from - great problem to have."}
{"text":"Okay, so the ambiance of this place is wonderful; lighting, seating, and decor. Now as for this being an \"average\" noise level establishment.....no it was loud. If you sat at a table with someone, you literally had to yell for them to hear. Maybe it was just a loud night, but not a first date type of place. However, it was would be a good place with a group of friends.   The food was okay. The truffle fries were too salty, the waffle cones were okay...nothing spectacular. Now the glazed bacon was yummy! It was sweet, salty, and spicy...perfect balance for the bacon. The drinks are smaller in person. The pictures from some Yelp reviews made the drinks look larger and the food more bountiful. Remember this is a tapas like place.   Overall it was an good place."}
{"text":"Speakeasy meets tapas, can life get any better than this?  I've been meaning to try The Cellar for the longest time, but never had the opportunity. I was in the mood to try something new and decided on Cellar, best decision I've made all week!   I went with a friend and we decided on a couple of tapas to share. We landed on the tacos, waffle cones and risotto. Everything was amazing! I would suggest that there be more servings with the tacos. Since it's a tapas place, people are usually sharing. Also, the waffle cones (filled with octopus, shrimp and chicken - 3 diff kinds) were incredibly difficult to share. We ended up complete destroying the waffles and didn't think the waffle cones complemented the flavors of the entire dish. I do highly recommend the risotto. It was probably the best risotto I've ever tasted!   As far as drinks, I decide on their twist of a Mai tai that had hints coconut essence - absolutely amazing! My friend also loved their drink, and the perfect setting for drinks!  Despite a couple of technical items, I truly enjoyed The Cellar and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I had heard great things from friends but the wife and I needed to check it out for ourselves. So we headed down to the cellar. I will say that you really feel like you're in another world when you first enter the cellar through the sliding door. The wife even exclaimed \"it's like we're not even in Charlotte anymore\". Promptly we were seated and our server was quick to introduce himself and explain the menu and the concept. There was a lot of info to consider, and we perused the extensive beer (both draft and bottle), cocktails, wine and spirit lists. There were definitely some rare beers on draft, but the real rare ones are on the bottle list. Prices for the bottles are overall reasonable, while others are definitely wallet busters. The drafts that we chose were alright but not spectacular. My favorite beer of the night was a peach sour beer from Allagash. It was from a bottle and definitely pricey. The wife switched to a cocktail on the second round, and if her Vieux Carré is any indication of the quality of the cocktails at the cellar, we will become regulars here. I will say that the bar crew seemed to know what they were doing.   On to the food, the smoked salmon flatbread was split between us and it was delicious. The flavors of the salmon were perfectly paired with the basil mascarpone spread and fried capers. The flatbread itself is very thin and crispy, not doughy like other flatbreads. The wife got the black grouper entree as her main and the burger sounded too good to pass up for me. First of all, the portion on both entrees and the flatbread were very generous, especially for the price point. My burger was cooked medium or maybe a little under which was perfect. The result was a juicy tasty burger that I will order again and again, along with recommending to others. The wife's grouper was cooked perfectly and the accompanying candied carrots, pesto rice and grilled artichokes complimented well the fish. No room really for a real dessert, but room for a liquid one in the form of a Greenman brewing chocolate stout to spilt between the 2 of us.  The service was on point, friendly, informative and engaging in conversation with us about beer, food, etc. I will say that the only drawback was the wooden vintage like high top chairs which are a little clunky and definitely not comfortable for the majority of people. Maybe I felt it more sitting on that chair since others in the booth or the low top tables had really cushy leather chairs. The haves versus the have nots I guess? We shall return often, but may skip if only high tops tables with vintage chairs are available. I would be worth the wait for me to get a cushy leather chair on my next visit."}
{"text":"We went in for some cocktails and had the charbroiled oysters! Superb!!!! We are on vacation but we are going to try and stop in again."}
{"text":"Great bar, Great service, great drinks, great tapas/food, great ambiance. Need I say more? I was looking for a speakeasy type place in Charlotte, and this hit the nail on the head - though it doesn't have the complete feel (reservations, go thru phone booth into bar, etc). My dad and I both got some drinks and an app. All was very good.   It's great to watch the bartenders craft the cocktails. They're also pretty knowledgeable on whisky and spirits.  Great craft beer selection as well.  definitely something worth trying (and trying, and trying)."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! The place is very beautiful and servers are nice. But the food is subpar. They don't cook burgers properly , no mater how you ask it cooked they all come well done. The truffled dishes are just to add a fancy name. The shrimp is so small and breaded so much it tastes like the ones you buy at Walmart in box. It was so bad my guests wanted to eat something outside. Never again!"}
{"text":"This place is really cool!! I've had dinner and just drinks here with friends. Super cool speakeasy vibe and their graham cracker s'mores dessert thang is amaze inggggg! The price is a bit high and it's hidden away under a sports bar but it's still a spot to check out!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Great atmosphere and the cocktails they make are the best I've had. It's a small place, so be sure to get reservations far in advance."}
{"text":"Well... would be a 5 except for the girl who worked the door Saturday night ... she was rude lazy and unhelpful.. about made me and my friend walk away in disgust without entering ...     Well.. we did finally manage to get in... spent over $100 each and was more than worth it....  staff were great inside the bar... food was terrific and good value... will go now often  ( as long as we get passed the door) that bit was ridiculous...  Also... staff are well trained and very kind and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"We have been combing the city and surrounding areas for the Perfect restaurant. Found it here. Best food, impeccable service, creative craft cocktails and impressive beer collection combined with an amazing atmosphere where you can actually hear each other speak at the dinner table. Great job!"}
{"text":"Charlotte, you've outdone yourself.  This. This is a cocktail bar. This is a cocktail bar with a small but mighty menu. It's a restaurant, too, sure, but it feels more like a cocktail bar. The menu here though is not to be dismissed. We simply loved their food. We loved their food so much, we found ourselves eating Brussells sprouts -- which we both hate. Or used to? Yes, The Cellar is your cool aunt working in cahoots with your mom because they will make you WANT to eat your Brussells sprouts and they will give you these strong and delicious cocktails as your intoxicating reward.  The ambiance: totally chill, but don't come here in sweatpants please. I mean, you technically could I'm sure, but out of respect for the cocktails....please dress for your cocktails. Perfect for a date, a girls night, 1:2 dinners with your parents, drinks with coworkers, casual drink \"things\" with that guy or girl that you aren't sure if they're on the same page as you???  The cocktail menu is quite extensive and we had a blast being creative there.  TIPS:  1) It's kind of dark....nothing to say about that really, but try not to get too schwasty because I can attest that the walk to the bathroom feels weird when your vision is blurry and the lights are dim. But I guess that's anywhere? 2) Make a reservation. People like to come here. Make a rez. My boyfriend made one and we still had to wait, BUT the hostess reserved two seats for us at the bar so that we could have a few drinks while we waited.  3) Get a flatbread. Get the balsamic Brussels sprouts. Put the balsamic Brussels sprouts on your flatbread. Eat like a pizza. Enjoy your life. 4) Get the burger maybe? My bf heard these great things about the burger and ordered it and loved it. I didn't try it. He didn't offer to share actually...???  So either he was being selfish or just genuinely loved that burger. Or loved the burger so much and selfishly decided NOT to share. *eyeroll* But don't feel too bad for me -- that flatbread was lit. And again please refer to tip #3 -- you wont regret it.  All in all....an excellent meal and wonderful drinks. Will 500% be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Dark but very cool interior. Great date spot. Fabulous drinks. Definitely a craft cocktail spot. Has every beer imaginable."}
{"text":"This place hands down has the best cheese sticks ever. Like I would literally come here just to order the cheese sticks and nothing else. Well maybe a drink, but only cheese sticks.  The Wednesday night pepperoni pizza special ($9) wasn't that great - it was a little burnt on the crust and the top. We ordered the blue cheese chips and they weren't that great either. I expect a chunkier blue cheese when the dish specifically calls out \"blue cheese\", not a runny sauce.  But nonetheless, the cheese sticks redeemed all the stars back. I don't even know what it was about them, but I could not stop thinking about how delicious they were. Get you some!"}
{"text":"We visited from out of town and this place was bomb! Our party of four ordered numerous items from the menu and everyone enjoyed their dishes. The standouts for me were the mac n cheese and the cocktails. If we find ourselves in Charlotte again we would stop in and try some other items from their menu. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food was Fabulous.  Atmosphere Terrific.  Drinks and beer Devine.  Best of all was the service, thank you Rachel!!!"}
{"text":"still five stars obviously but i have been here multiple times since my original review and service is still 5 stars and the food is still 6 stars.   I have probably tried 1/3 of the menu at this point and have yet to find something i do not love. The actual beer cellar which i believe was complete a few months ago is amazing and they will take you in there and help you pick out something unique!  seems like their cocktail menu has grown as well"}
{"text":"The server was pleasant and knowledgeable about the beers and food. The brussel sprouts and mac & cheese we're wonderful (both contained prosciutto). The burger was nothing spectacular and the mini tacos we're legit mini. My main complaint is the $17 martini I was served. I inquired about their drink menu, asking if they had other martinis. The server informed me that the bartender could make a chocolate cherry martini and asked what kind of vodka I liked. I told her nothing crazy, but not Wells either. While I was drinking the martini I had others at the table taste it, as it tasted off. Not bad, just a little weird. When we relieved the bill, I figured out why. I was charged $12 for Jameson Reserve and $5 for other liquors. When I inquired about the Jameson, as I thought I was getting vodka, I was told they had to make it that way. No one told me this, what if brown liquor made me angry!?  It left a poor impression that there was no communication and I was charged $17 for something I really didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"Met some business colleagues for late dinner and drinks and they have every kind of beer you can imagine. Knowledgeable staff guide you through the choices. I had a wine (don't hate!) and it wa so good I had 2. Just try. It's worth it."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are top notch, it's at the edge of the downtown but an easy walk from most hotels and businesses.  I love the smoked drinks, bacon appetizer, and shrimp and grits. The reason it's 4 stars and not 5 is that the last two times I was there I was quoted a 30 minute wait.  On both occasions the restaurant was nearly empty and remained nearly empty not just for the 30 minutes but for the duration of my meal. This gives the distinct impression that they are not interested in my business as a lone business traveler.  I wish the food wasn't so good because i'd loved to write this restaurant off."}
{"text":"I will start of by saying the food and the atmosphere was amazing. But I had the absolute worst, horrific, taunting, harassing service. For some reason my business associate and I were treated so poorly from the moment we walked in to have dinner at the bar by all three bartenders, one female with brown hair and a pony tail, Dave and mostly by one named Amanda who represented herself as a manager.  Amanda showed the worst, absolutely appalling, disrespectful behavior towards us. When I asked why she is treating us so rudely, she said   \"if we don't like the service that we are welcome to go post it all over Yelp and tell our friends\". I said, excuse me, I am trying to finish my dinner that I am paying for and that we did not need to be treated like that. She then told me if I didn't like the service I didn't have to be there. I told her great, I will make sure that I find the owners of this restaurant and let them know this is her attitude. She said good, go ahead.   The 3 bartenders mentioned above kept on with the harassment and started laughing at us and started imitating my conversation I had about being from California. I heard Dave the bartender repeating my conversations to them. They just sat there laughing and starring at us. At this point I was completely shaking, embarrassed and humiliated. I asked them to stop being so rude and let us at least finish our meals in peace. Amanda laughed in our face and walked off. I asked for our bill and let them know I was done being treated like that. I paid the bill and a couple minutes later Taylor, who seemed to be a manger came over and apologized for the issue with the brussel sprouts coming out late and that he would take them off of the bill. I told him I had already paid the bill and that I was leaving because we were being treated so poorly. Just then as he was apologizing to us Amanda walks over, patted him on the back and said again, \"Feel free to tell Yelp and your friends all about it, I don't care\". Taylor tried apologizing profusely and said that he couldn't believe she just did that in front of him and would have a conversation with her. I told Taylor that I have never been treated so poorly and that the business associate I was with had the same experience recently. He said that he would let the head manager know about the issue. At that point Dave, the bartender then tried to apologize because he saw what Amanda did. He then gave me her name. I told him he really should be careful how he and the others treat people. On the way out,  Amanda laughed at us, waved and said good-bye and good luck.   I saw Taylor at the front door and said to him that she was still continuing to harass us. Just then another couple was walking out of the restaurant and overheard us and said we just had the same experience. Such rude service.  This experience was absolutely horrific. It's such a shame because the food and the atmosphere were great!"}
{"text":"Extensive beer list and cozy underground feel make this place a good choice. Food is consistently good but nothing truly standout. Our group of 8 or so sampled across the menu and enjoyed everything. Also big props to the friendly maitre d' and service staff who made us feel welcome and accommodated some last minute additions."}
{"text":"My second time around and this time I brought a few friends and got to try more dishes. Hands down my favorite dish is the char grilled oysters. They're very comparable to Dragos char grilled oysters in New Orleans. So delicious. One of my friends got the salmon flat bread and it was pretty good. The hummus was typical hummus but they served it with a fresh tomato, cucumber and feta cheese salad tossed in mustard seeds which was really delicious! Another friend got the waaffle cones and she siad they were delicious. My other friend who was oretty hangry when we arrived, ordered the burger and fries and she was a very happy lady.  The Cellar has become my new favorite place for small plates. It's running neck and neck with Soul. But this is THE BEST place to get char grilled oysters in Charlotte! I want to shout about this place from the rooftop but I also want to keep it our little secret. It's definitely a hidden gem in the heart of crown town!!!"}
{"text":"By far, the best food in Charlotte since moving from Los Angeles. Sit at the bar and ask for Ron, you're in good hands."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 6 people for work. We went for an early dinner at 6:15pm when the restaurant was still quiet. I called ahead and they had a table ready for us. Our server was amazing. She was patient even though we had 6 separate checks and orders. Her recommendations were spot on. We ordered the waffles, brussel sprouts, tuna, tacos, mac and cheese, and many more that were all just delicious. Thank you for a great night. I very highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was delicious. At the table we had scallops, jalapeño bacon, fries, steak etc. Everything tasted delicious. Only snag was a friend has a sever nut allergy. The server and kitchen were well aware. There must have been cross contamination because she had a reaction to her dish as we were leaving."}
{"text":"Went in around 2pm on a Saturday, pretty dead yet took 10 mins to get a 3 page beer list when all I wanted was a screwdriver. So then I had to wait another 10 mins for her to come back. Heard them apologize to man next to me for losing his food order after he waited 30 mins for a sub. Drank my one and asked for to pay, from that time when I asked it took 18 mins to get my tab for one drink! Def won't be back"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food, drinks, and beer. Craft cocktails that stand up to the best NYC has to offer. Steaks to rival Peter Luger. Desserts unbeatable."}
{"text":"A very cozy place nestled in the heart of Charlotte. It's built in a cellar and has a pretty cool history to it. Gets a little too noisy to even communicate with the server. Their selection of cocktails is brilliant. I got the cellar smash - one of the best cocktails I've had! The food was decent but not great - brussel sprouts and Korean BBQ flat bread. I would go back to try their meat dishes and hopefully those will be more impressive. $56 for 2 drinks and 2 small plates."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of state and had the best time! We were able to take a tour of their beer cellar and enjoy some great steak and shrimp and grits! Great service and cocktails!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite date spots. Awesome ambiance, great food and amazing cocktails. Be prepared to spend some $ but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"The speakeasy bar that Charlotte needed. I love that the Cellar is a hidden gem beneath the TV-laden sports bar Duckworth's. You'll feel like you stepped into another era as soon as you walk downstairs. An air of mystery with the hostess outside the sliding door. Once inside, The Cellar is the perfect size to feel exclusive with a fun 1920s vibe. We tried a few small plates which were good, but the star of the show is definitely their drink list. All of the cocktails sounded delicious, but I went with the Avery Raspberry Sour Ale. They have unique beers that you can't find anywhere else in Charlotte and I love the way everything was presented. Definitely recommend checking out this unique addition to the Uptown scene."}
{"text":"I hate to review this place poorly, but it is a place that seems to get super busy and crowded very fast. We waited a while, but there is no waiting area and people bump into each other constantly. So this is not a review of the food, just the getting in experience."}
{"text":"The ambiance is outstanding. Craft cocktails, wines and beer list are solid. The food is on point. Just be prepared to wait......for everything...  the service was excruciatingly sllloooowwww...  I get being busy, but if I'm a patron at a bar, especially on a night where the bar and restaurant are at 50% capacity, I feel I should at the very least be acknowledged and made to feel welcome.  As well, I would suggest to management to encourage staff NOT to walk between tables and the patrons at bar because there's a constant bumping of the bar chairs. Annoying to say the least.   Started with their smoked whisky sour. The art of the cocktail making for this drink is a sight to see.  If you're at the bar, order one...  you won't be disappointed. Try to sit by the short end of the bar by the pick up station. I wish they'd prepare this cocktail right in front of you but.....they don't.   Also had the charcuterie board, tacos and ribeye...  the charcuterie was great and the tacos solid except for the chicken which had little flavor and was mushy.  The ribeye had an excellent seasoned char and cooked to perfect temperature...  Overall the place was solid and I'd go back. Great place to take a date."}
{"text":"Speakeasy vibe that falls short in some areas.  Walking through an American Pub type restaurant and down some stairs into its basement feels like you might stumble across an underground poker game. It makes for an interesting vibe; arguably something that is largely missing from Uptown. The decor and setting make for a pretty cool experience. Something about it feels very private and intimate even though it will most likely be packed.  If you are labeling yourself as a speakeasy-style restaurant you better have outstanding cocktails and The Cellar holds up pretty well in this area. The beer selection is pretty good as well. Food-wise they could certainly do some things better. The grilled octopus was not done very well and tasted a bit off. The waffle cone trio while an interesting idea, failed to really impress. The duck ragu felt like it was just trying a little too hard. The Brussels sprouts are excellent, but those are hard to mess up.   After a handful of visits here, I've realized the service can be hit or miss. Some wait staff are fully capable of providing excellent service even though they are clearly slammed, while others only check in every 15-30 minutes. I wish it were more consistent. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND making a reservation well in advance. This isn't the place to roll up to at 7PM asking for a table.  All in all, this is a very interesting spot that I would recommend checking out, but after a 3 year span, other restaurants on the surface have surpassed it...3.5/5."}
{"text":"Great reviews but my actual take not quite so good.  Had the truffle fries... Yummy. The waffle cone offerings, the chicken was over cooked, breading dark, too tough. The shrimp was the same.  Overly fried, tough.  Not sure if dirty, old grease or just left in it took long. The tuna was the better if the three. My friends enjoyed the shrimp and grits and the charred brussel sprouts.  Both were delish, according to them.  Their signature cocktails, prohibition style were smooth and flavorful.  I had the margarita and my friends the sazarac."}
{"text":"This was our second time dining at The Cellar and it was even better than the first. From the service, presentation, to the timing, and of course, the food - everything was spot on. Our server was very informative of everything on the menu (I like to ask questions to see how much they pay attention to the chef before service starts) - he was awesome.   I even noticed the server at the table next to us, inform the table they were out of tilefish, but were offering grouper as a sub - that was very impressive! Most restaurants would try and pass off the sub without telling the guest - that was a big point for me! We started with the charcuterie and cheese plate - phenomenal! The house made beer mustard - THAT needs to be bottled! We split the tuna tartare - great portion size for the price and flavor was spot on. By the time we got our entrees, I was already getting full, I managed to save a few bites for my awesome shrimp and grits. He had the burger (rare) and loved every bite!  This is not a place to go for \"happy hour\" beers - this is a intimate place for a great date night, bringing clients from work, or just to come after a long day for a fantastic cocktail that is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Love the cellar! It's such a great atmosphere whether it's for a date or just meeting with friends. Medium sized plates allow you to  try more of the amazing menu.... I recommend the waffle cones and the Brussel sprouts"}
{"text":"The ambiance was remarkable. Our waiter Bobby was very passionate about serving and made great recommendations. The drink cockations were so fresh and the food was exquisite. Great venue for a first date and special occasions."}
{"text":"Updating! Another amazing tour of the menu, this time we brought family to sample more of the deliciousness! This time we enjoyed the burger, scallops (OMG!!!), Duck ragou, and shrimp and grits! Add to that the amazing shareable small plates, including the duck flatbread, candied bacon, truffle Mac and cheese. We have no complaints whatsoever and will be making another reservation very soon!"}
{"text":"The Cellar at Duckworths is a culinary experience that will leave with a warm fuzzy feeling (not just from the cocktails). When you head downstairs from the sports bar and tap house that is Duckworths you pass through a time warp that takes you back to a time when a secret password allowed you to enter into a place of soft jazz, great food and expertly crafted cocktails. The cellar offers everything you could want and more. I have found myself returning time and again and have tried almost the entire menu without dissapointment. The morning flip is my cocktail of choice, a creamy finish that pairs perfectly with the indulgent layered chocolate tort. If you're unlike me and would prefer to start the night with a meal and not desert, I highly recommend the lamb carpaccio or the succulent butter basted scallops. To be honest just enter The Cellar and be prepared to try it all, it's an experience you will not forget."}
{"text":"Aside from the regular Duckworth's the Cellar is awesome!  After you make it down the stairs you get transformed into the 1920's speak easy feel. Here you get to try some bomb as rarer beers, great draft list, and awesome low Distro'd bottles.  I have had the chance to drink BC Vanilla Rye and Founder's CBS here. The food list is decent and is way different.  They have their own kitchen separate from the upstairs.  If you are a beer nerd like me, this is the spot to go.  Don't forget your wallet though!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I have ever had at an establishment and I didn't even make it in the door.  My friends and I wanted to check out the Cellar, as I heard it was a cool experience.  We walked downstairs and the young lady sitting at the reception desk was chatting up a guy.  She never gave us eye content or asked if we needed help.  After standing there for a minute I thought I would poke my head in to see if there was a bar where we could stand and have a drink.  Before I could put a step in the breezeway the young lady, and I use that term loosely, stuck her finger in my face and said \"Uhh.....wait\" and then turned back to her conversation.  Luckily for her my friends pulled me out, as it was not going to end well for her.  We walked outside and then decided to head back to communicate our displeasure to the manager.  He listened to our feedback and said he was going to speak to her that evening.  I don't think that he had enough urgency for the situation, as she should have been addressed immediately.  Don't waste your time hear.  I heard that they have a low health rating anyway.  Walk on by!"}
{"text":"As out of town visitors I rely on yelp quite a bit for dining. We were in Charlotte for my brother's graduation and wanted a splurge dinner. We are foodies and wanted a nice atmosphere and great food. We were very pleased when we walked into the Cellar. It was dark, intimate, with exposed brick and beams. It literally felt like you were in this cozy hide away gem that not everyone knows about yet. The waiter explained to us that they were going for a speakeasy type theme, and well it works!!! Our service was impeccable and the waiter was very knowledgeable about EVERYTHING on the menu. I went with his drink suggestions and his wine suggestions with the food and it was spot on. The Cellar has an actual beer cellar so it has more beer selections than you can imagine. The cocktails are all handcrafted. Everything is muddled with fresh fruit, fresh ginger etc. There are no mixes used. We even saw a bartender light a piece of wood on fire and fill a pint glass up with smoke to infuse in a drink!       Now for the food...we did a lot of tasting dishes. We started with the waffle cone small plates. It sounded interesting, but the mix of spices with the sweet waffle cones were very complimentary of each other. Next we moved onto the trio of tacos and found that the pork belly taco was to die for! My brother was craving steak so he went with the filet. The filet was cooked with just simple spices in a double broiler that is 1600 degrees, so the steak has a nice char while being perfectly cooked on the inside. We split the shrimp and grits. They were old mill cheddar grits with a sort of shrimp etouffee, topped with a 6 minuted cooked egg. I literally would have licked the bowl if I had not been in public. We of course had to try two desserts, the campfire smores and the cornflake crusted french toast. The French toast was good dessert, it had a lot of bread and after all of that food...it was too much for me. The smore however, was out of this world.      We only encountered one snafu and a burger was brought to our table instead of the steak we ordered....no big deal...it looked amazing! They discounted our steak..... which was crazy...b/c we did not complain or even care really!  All and all this place focuses on amazing food, outstanding service, and unique drinks. I loved every last morsel and the whole experience! I will definitely go back when I am back in Charlotte...and when I do I will get the divine looking burger and the truffle mac and cheese!  Food for thought: If you are going here for a quick drink and a quick bite, maybe stay upstairs in the taproom. While our food was perfectly coursed out...this is somewhere you should go to enjoy yourself. The price point is perfect, you can go and spend as little or as much as you desire!"}
{"text":"Neat space. Strange Pee-wee Herman-like waiter. Our second entree was delivered 20 minutes after the first. Nobody ever came to our table to explain the problem (a waiter had mistakenly taken our entree to another table). They comp'd the dish but it ruined our night, Total bummer."}
{"text":"First Sticky table, hot, slow service, and a bit over priced.  This place looks like it would be cool. There were some issues though and we ultimately walked out before we ever ordered a drink. First we had to wait for the hostess to show up. Then when we sat down we were greeted and given dirty silverware. After meeting our waiter and being given time to look the drink menu over my fiancé went to the bathroom. When she got back the waiter still hadn't come back by so we left. Never had a good experience at a Duckworths. Something is always off."}
{"text":"We lucked out with a table for two on a late Friday night and we are convinced it was one of the best culinary decisions we have ever made.  The cocktails and drinks are provided for you on an iPad with pictures and a description of the drinks and their ingredients. Very helpful for a cocktail neophyte like myself.  The cocktails did take a few minutes longer than any other bar but they were worth every second-just incredible. All of the food we had was out of this world and delicious.  We're trying to get back to Charlotte just for some more of the bacon glazed with jalapeño"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and delicious food. Just plan to spend some money, but worth it. Cool speakeasy style place."}
{"text":"First off,  I absolutely love the ambiance! I started with the Cellar Mai Tai...my new favorite cocktail! I will be back just for the excellent drink menu! Next, I had the glazed Brussel sprouts, delicious! For my final course I thoroughly enjoyed the blackened grouper with pesto rice and carrots and artichokes! The Cellar is a very nice, private, sexy spot to go and have a great meal and a fabulous cocktail!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot to bring a date. Delicious drinks and food with the right ambiance to make it romantic without overdoing it.  Location: 4/5 Close to the edge of the Tryon Street nightlight in Uptown. There's a parking lot immediately across the street so that's convenient if you're not trying to spend the time to find street parking. You can also park at the 7th Street Market garage as well and hoof it a block and a half.    Atmosphere / Ambiance: 5/5 \"Romantical + Trendy-ish\". Dimly lit but you won't run into tables or have to use the wall to guide yourself out. You don't need to wear a bow-tie, unless that's your think but keep it classy like you would if you lived in San Diego.  Cleanliness: 5/5 Well kept up and clean.  Service: 5/5 The staff was very engaging. Just the appropriate amount of engaging. Not the check on you every 30 seconds which can be annoying but they'll make sure you're enjoying your meal and drinks. If you can't make up your mind, they will gladly point you in the right direction with genuine recommendations or feedback.   Food / Drinks: 5/5 All the food was amazing. Very delicious. The portions  aren't huge so no need for your pants with the stretchy waist bands. The drinks were on point too. There's a good selection of craft beer. I can't remember for sure, but I don't think they share the same massive list of beer as Duckworths upstairs."}
{"text":"This spot is amazing!! Big things are going to happen here!! Tapas style with a big heart. Service was outstanding and the food was nothing short of AMAZING. The oysters, oh the oysters!! Craft cocktails you say? Ummm, yes! Craft beer? Even better!! This concept will blow you away as will the people that work within! I cannot wait to go back and continue the journey here. Charlotte has a real gem here!"}
{"text":"An easy 10 out of 10.  We've been hoping a place like this would open in Charlotte and little did we know here it is right down the street in the cellar of Duckworth's.  The ambiance is dark and broody, but it's what you would expect (and want) for a pseudo prohibition style cocktail bar.  The attention to detail was impeccable.  Heavy wood, exposed brick walls, a full cocktail bar laden with blow torches and fresh plants for drinks.  Speaking of drinks...the drinks were incredible.  Handcrafted, spiced in house, blocked ice.... mmmm.  We both got the Eastfield or East Village (can't remember) cocktail.  It's their take on an Old Fashion with homemade spiced cherries and orange oils.  We got two each and didn't even bother to try anything else.  The food (I am smiling as I write this because I am so happy) is mouthwatering.  I can like a place just fine, but if their food is average I will probably not be back often.  Thankfully the Cellar's food is artistic cuisine.  It's tapas style and every single bite we had was fresh and bright, full of flavor.   We started with the truffle mac and cheese (don't even.... oh my... stop) and the caramelized Brussels sprouts.  Then we had the charred romaine and the tacos.  Seriously, every bite was better than the last.  Even the things we weren't expecting much out of were bursting with flavor.  But the climax was the dessert.  The homemade, handcrafted almond s'mores.  Oh.  My.  God.  I'm not even sure I can try to describe this dessert in words that are not worthy of it's confectionary godliness.  You just really have to try it.    I think I'll make it my goal to try everything on the menu before Christmas."}
{"text":"Our first night in Charlotte and we were not disappointed! The Cellar is beautiful, romantic, and the jazz music just tops it off. The drinks were delicious. The bartender knows what he's doing! We were fortunate enough to have Will as our server. He was fantastic! Really knows his stuff and was extremely attentive without being overbearing. This guy is a pro! We had the tuna tartar, the lemon risotto, Brussel sprouts, truffle fries and the filet... Which was probably the best filet I've ever had. The char on this steak was perfection... The steak melted in your mouth. I highly recommend this place! It was delicious!!!!! Oh... And their craft beer selection is insane. Check out the beer cellar if you get a chance."}
{"text":"Made the trek from Indian Land to Uptown for an Elite event which turned out to be a great Duckworth's familiarization occasion.  Just about smack in the middle of Charlotte, this is the original location of Duckworth's and we learned a lot about their founding as well as what they offer.  And we ate and drank a few of those offerings.  And this was my first Duckworth's experience.  I can assure you that it will not be my last and here is why.   Cocktails are something they are innovating with.  Popular in the 1920s up until the 1970s and then a resurgence of popularity in the 1990s, another lull and now it appears that Duckworth's is ahead of the resurgence of cocktails in the early 2000s.  Why do I say that?  Three that we sampled:  The French Buck:  Fresh ginger and lemon with gin, vermouth and Prosecco (!) is Duckworth's take on the classic French 75.  Light and flavorful, not alcoholically tasting, what some might refer to as a ladies drink.  My wife would love it as a ginger and lemon lover.  East Village:  As a Manhattan drinker I liked their twist here.  Bourbon and three Amaros (digestives taken mostly as after dinner stomach-settlers...lots of different varieties), topped with a caramelized orange oil.  Wow!  Very smooth and flavorful...best Manhattan I have had.  And the talk of the table was the ice cube.  It was a two inch square of ice that floated in the old fashioned glass, melting slowly and not diluting the drink.  Very cleaver and classy.  Covington's Asian Pear:  Velvety spiced pear and citrus with a smooth foamy top.   Easy to say, but no details.  It was wonderful...like a dessert.  The foam was like whipped egg whites with a couple of dots of bitters.  We all objected that the serving was way too small for the amount of deliciousness it carried.  Another ladies drink.  Classy and good looking as well as complex.  The brief history of Duckworth's was interrupted by so many people rudely talking among themselves, but it was a good talk to hear.  Ask if you have a group here of a full table as you appreciate the history and some facts about Charlotte as well as Duckworth's.  In brief, and probably lacking accuracy, two guys were a bit frustrated in drinking beer served at the wrong serving temperatures.  Different beers are ideally served at one of three general temperatures.  Duckworth's started as a beer place and they now have 110 beers on tap, from three rooms kept at recommended temperatures, and hundreds of other beers in bottles.  Yes, there is a beer cellar which we toured.  Fascinating.  So this is a place to try beers that you have never heard about before.  Of course, Duckworth's expanded in drink and food, the result being where you sit today.  And it will change and innovate as time goes on, I am certain.  When they bought the current uptown location they discovered that the building's concrete foundation was over three feet thick.  Ummmm...turns out that that location was a speakeasy well before national Prohibition went into effect.  That thick waist of concrete was an effective sound barrier.  Further, we learned that Charlotte outlawed alcohol in the early 1900s, two decades or more before Prohibition became national law.  And...although national Prohibition ended in the late 1930s, Charlotte continued to outlaw alcohol until 1953 or so.    We were served five small plates of food to try.  A great opportunity. And this was a drink and snack occasion, not dinner.  Cheese and Charcuterie:  Basically a cheese and little bits assortment.  A warm-up or just something to munch on before dinner...or more small plates, like tapas.  Candied Jalapeno Bacon:  Lardo, pork belly, bacon...just wonderful flavor and crunchiness.  This version was a bit sweet for me, but the jalapeno gave it a nice kick.  Very sugary and, to me, more of a dessert than appetizer.  Soooo good, but not if you are on a health or diet kick.  Caramelized Brussels:  Just what it says but was mixed with smoked pancetta, red onion and LOTS of balsamic.  Just way too much balsamic for me, but did have a rich taste and most liked it.  Truffle Mac & Cheese:  Oh boy!  Rich, thick, small shells of cheesy pasta and LOADED with truffles.  So much so that it was, to me, rather overwhelming.  But, if you like truffles, this is your taste heaven.  The cheese blend was Grafton cheddar, smoked Gouda and, as if you would need more, toasted pancetta.  Finally, Tuna Tartare, complete with the warning about consuming under-cooked seafood.  But the blend of high sushi grade tuna mixed with sesame seeds & chili oil was served with fresh chunky guacamole and fried won ton crisps.  Will have to return to this location or the Ballantyne location which is closer to where I live to have an actual dinner and get into beer samples.   Duckworth's is worth your time, attention and patronage."}
{"text":"Delicious food, wonderful cocktails, and incredibly attentive service. Try The Cellar Smash, the Mac and cheese, and the scallops! Try ANYTHING actually and you'll be satisfied!"}
{"text":"What a spot. A speak easy theme with crafted cocktails. I only give 5 stars when I'm blown away by food. I had the charred oysters .... twice. And the candied bacon. I never made it to the entrees. Food and liquor were great. Service was great. Lighting and ambience great. Can't wait to get back.   Ps no tv's it's not a \"Can you put the game On\" kind of place."}
{"text":"This might be a one off,  but my experience wasn't as spectacular as some of the other reviews about this place. Service was extremely slow.  It took our server 10 minutes to approach our table after we sat. And even longer to bring our appetizers to our table.  We ordered a drink from the bar, and that took 15 minutes to deliver.  The food was okay but I'm sure that's been distorted for me by the mediocre service. I will say everyone was nice and the manager visited our table to resolve some of the issues.  The aesthetics were nice and low key and had a very chilled vibe.  But for what your paying for food as this place, I expect more. As I said in the beginning,  this might be a one off and I'm willing to try this place again."}
{"text":"Great new place in Charlotte! I had dinner and drinks with my friend last Friday night, we sat at the bar and had both dinner and drinks.  The bartenders are terrific, they really know how to make great craft cocktails, the bar has a speakeasy kind of feel, which I like. We had the tuna tartare appetizer it was delicious. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"On a weekender in Charlotte, we made reservations here.   It was a small speakeasy themed restaurant, a theme popular in the area, you have to walk into another restaurant (Duckworth's) and down the stairs to get to it.   We ordered a charcuterie board, the waffle cones, and a ribeye to share. I usually don't go for red meats, but our waiter raved about how their head chef was making sure each piece came out perfect of their 1800 degree oven. I have to admit the waiter really sold me on it.   Our food came out all at once, which was so strange to me. Although we didn't specify when we ordered, I would've expected it to be staged.  The charcuterie board was good, not the best, but it's really hard to mess this one up. The waffle cones were supposed to be: 1, 2, 3, but they all had very similar flavors - the fillings were all too sweet. Finally, the ribeye was definitely rare, average, and not worth the money."}
{"text":"My first time in Charlotte this place was a gem of a find. Crab cocktail beverages. They do seem a bit pricey but they were complex and delicious. Food is slightly more reasonably priced and very well done. The shrimp and grits was slightly atypical and wonderful."}
{"text":"Service at the bar wasn't the best, but there was only one bartender on and a constant stream of orders.  I got the steak and cheese supreme and it was really delicious.  I'd definitely eat here again.  Drinks were poured well."}
{"text":"Took my husband last week for his bday dinner. Love the atmosphere, staff and food! We shared many of the tapas since they are pretty small. My favorite was the scallops! Can't beat the drink menu on the ipad either!  Love there's no tvs!"}
{"text":"My partner and I celebrated our birthdays (just a couple days apart) this year at The Cellar. This was our second visit to the restaurant and we look forward to going back again. We shared 5 items off the menu - while our 2 favorites were the saffron fettucine with grilled octopus and black grouper, everything was amazing. The ever-popular waffle cones were quite tasty, but a little sweeter than I would have liked.  We began with a charcuterie board that included wild boar sausage and lab cheddar - both were outstanding.    We also each had 2 craft cocktails - the blackberry mezcal mule was deliciously smoky (it was very fun to watch the bartender burning something and capturing the smoke in a pint glass at the bar) and the Cellar Crush was full of fresh, spicy ginger and crushed ice - a sweet and spicy treat!  While the costs prohibit this from being an everyday restaurant, it's certainly one of my favorites for special occasions or splurge nights.  We did make reservations for a Saturday night.  It appears that a couple could probably get a seat at the bar fairly easily until about 6:30 - after that, the room was packed!"}
{"text":"CAN I SAY THIS WORTH THE MONEY!!    The Cellar is downstairs inside Duckworth's bar. The Cellar is in the basement with very dim lighting. VERY romantic! It's a small restaurant, I like it, small so it was perfect for me. The tables are a tab bit close it each other, but it's ok. The food is AMAZING good with a mouth full of flavor!!!! OUR WAITER WAS DARREN AND HE WAS AMAZING, GREAT AND KNOWLEDGEABLE OF THE MENU AND DRINKS!! They have beer you have never heard of, they will also give you a tour of the restaurant. I mean we REALLY ENJOYED OURSELVES!!!"}
{"text":"Finally made it back. I was super excited to come back and have another great experience. This time I dined with a group of four to celebrate several birthdays. From the moment I walked in something wasn't  right. The main dining area seemed half full, extra loud and people/tables were jammed up by the only entrance to the dining room.   When we were seated, a server was setting up the table behind ours. I said excuse me to the server that was standing over my seat (after the rest of my party was seated) and he turned around and sneered at me. That set the tone for the rest of the evening.     When I finally sat down we all didn't have menus and only one iPad with the drink menu. The server proceeded to rush us to order drinks. No, is this your first time here or can I explain the drink menu to you. I could go on ... To sum it up, the service was terrible and not knowledgeable enough to explain the concept to us, as two of the folks dining with us we're first timers. She didn't have any craft beer knowledge as a brown ale does not equal a Stella and we were continuously rushed thorough the meal.   The food was great as usual. However, the service far overshadowed the great food. For that reason I have to give the experience only 3 stars.  12/25 Thanks for the reply Duckworth's responding to you directly as suggested and received no response. Once again great service. Minus one star for the additional great service."}
{"text":"Great beers , what a amazing sleelction   Mediocre food , had Caesar salad with chicken .  Good parking lot for like 7 bucks across the street after 5 pm ."}
{"text":"Awesome appetizers, good craft cocktails, and a great environment. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The Cellar is one of my favorite, higher end restaurants I've been to. The restaurant is below Duckworths, but once you enter the restaurant, you don't feel like you're below a sports bar in the slightest. The lighting, decor and ambiance is so romantic and rustic.   The drink menu is listed on the iPad with a description and ingredient list. The drinks were delicious. The regular menu isn't overwhelming and has a nice variety of appetizers, sharing plates and main courses. We went with another couple and split 3 items and a dessert and were full.   The service was spectacular and our waitress was very knowledgeable and attentive. You will definitely spend some cash here, so be prepared, but so worth it. Great date spot and will be returning!"}
{"text":"Hi, The food here is good, some nice choices.   HOWEVER!!! The management has a decidedly \"we are to cool for you\" attitude that unfortunately conveys to the wait staff.    We loved the guacamole and asked if we could get a side and chips. We were told that \"I'm sorry. The chef only accounts for the exact number of portions that are needed for  the entrées \"    Waited 30 min for our \"craft cocktails\".  Tried to move our party  to the bar.  Manager type said they saved bar stools for walk-ins. Really!!!??  We are at a table that we are not happy with. And we can't move to the bar?  Beyond comprehension!!   Move on. Don't even think about this place. Their customer service.  SUCKS  There are many other good places to go...food as good... service better."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I will admit to becoming very stuck up on food after living in the SF Bay Area. This place was great! Wonderful beer selection & cocktails. We had the tacos & 14 oz ribeye and they were amazing! Wish we had more time (and stomach space) to try more! If we find ourselves back in Charlotte we will be back here."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a speak easy feel to it. You walk downstairs and it has a great mood. It is a little loud during he peak hour, but that doesn't take away from the experience. The server was quick to greet and was beyond helpful! We share a few dishes. The Brussels sprouts, tuna tartar, truffle oil Mac and cheese and the ribeye steak. All were great! The Mac and cheese was so rich and tasty."}
{"text":"Swanky place- dimly lit, wood hewn atmosphere, steel bar stools, leather accents... The food options were creative and top quality. We ordered truffle fries, salmon flatbread, black grouper, scallops, and almond s'mores. Everything was fantastic as was the service."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to check this place out since moving here. We decided to go for his birthday along with my friend visiting from out of town.   We had reservations and were immediately seated at a high top. It has a nice vibe but it's a tight space and a bit loud for my personal liking.   We ordered several small plates: charcuterie, Brussels with balsamic and pancetta, truffle mac and cheese, steamed bun pork sliders, and a steak to share. Everything was delicious! It was nice to have foods we like but with a twist...something different. My only complaint was that everything came out so close together not leaving much room at the table and somewhat rushed our experience.   Our server Darren was awesome and made the night! Being our first time, he took the time to tell us about the restaurant, drinks and food. He even brought out a surprise dessert and candle to celebrate my husband's birthday. It was a great way to end the evening!   Am I glad we went? Absolutely! Would we go back? Maybe...for a special occasion. Cocktails average $13-$15 and some of the small plates average about the same which quickly adds up. If you haven't been, it's worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This was a great place. Atmosphere was stellar, drinks were awesome, apps were tasty. Try a Manhattan #2 if you're in to those"}
{"text":"Great food but slow service. The drink list is on an iPad which is hard for more than one person at a time to look at. Space is quite claustrophobic and I think it's the excessively dim lighting. The beers are all IPAs and high gravity. Not horrible if that's what you're in the mood for. I ended up going upstairs."}
{"text":"Orders 4 tapas here. Fries, the triple cones, black grouper, and strawberry parfait. All of them were decent. If need to rank them, the desert was the best and the triple cones was the worst.   Prob different than a lot of reviewers. While checking the reviews to order food, truffle fries were one of the top. However since we Came to visit charlottes from Chicago, food in Chicago was much better.  Truffle fries you can find in most dt restaurants in Chicago. This one here was just normal level.   The three cones were one the the top as well. However feel just so so. The tuna was the worst. You can't feel the tuna taste when eating with sweet cone.   Parfait was really nice. Yogurt and goat cheese with some nuts in side made it fresh and thick creamy. Nice home made dish.   Overall, you can't compare Charlottes food level with other big cities'. However this restaurant still serves the nice food in the city."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out! Dinner was amazing! We share a ribeye and mac and cheese. Our cocktails were too strong, but overall we loved it!"}
{"text":"If you are in town, you absolutely have to go to this place!  It's probably one of the most romantic spots I've ever been to in Charlotte.  They have an extensive beer menu (500 in the cellar, 20 on tap) and make everything for their cocktails from scratch!  As soon as the chefs are done cooking your food, it goes straight to your table!  They don't let food sit under heat lamps- and I can really appreciate it!  Speaking of the food, they have eclectic, traditional, exquisite, and delicious things on the menu!  I wish I could have tried it all!  Seriously a Charlotte gem.  You have to check it out!"}
{"text":"Food is so delicious. Tapas style dining but make sure you make a reservation. It is very small down there and reservations fill up quick. It's pretty pricey but you get what you pay for. It's a cute spot for late night dining with your significant other."}
{"text":"An ABSOLUTELY incredible experience! If you're looking for place the perfect date night or somewhere to catch up with good friends, you have found the spot! The Cellar at Duckworth's hands down has impeccable service paired with even better food and drink selections. I will certainly return to this place in the near future!"}
{"text":"Liked this place, but wish I could give it about 3.5 stars  Pros: Great bartenders.  My cocktail (blackberry mezcal mule) was amazing. My boyfriend's sazerac was the best he can remember having The smores dessert (messy, but awesome) The atmosphere: dark, noisy, busy (if you like that sort of thing)  Cons: Seems like there's frequently a wait, but I think they take reservations A bit pricey Entrees were good, but both seemed to be missing something.  I got the saffron fettuccine and he got the hangar steak.  Mine seemed to be missing something to make it pop, my first thought would be pancetta, but another strong flavor might do.  The biggest negative for hangar steak was the polenta \"fries\" were tasty, but needed a saucy to dip in since they were a tad bland and dry.    We would go back, and at the very least have drinks and dessert.  Maybe try small plates or the burger, which looked awesome."}
{"text":"Incredible Shrimp and Grits and truffle mac! If you are a beer enthusiast make sure you ask for a tour of the beer cellar!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a restaurant that has a prohibition feel, amazing craft cocktails, and a diverse yet vibrant menu, low and behold the cellar at duckworths. They have an actual cellar with a myriad of beers - many from wicked weed too. The overall experience was fantastic, the drinks were artisan and well crafted and the food exceeded all reasonable recommendation. 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"So I was searching for a speakeasy in Charlotte and came across The Cellar in the Duckworth. If you go downstairs you'll be greeted my hostess and taken to your seat where you'll be handed an old style book. To my surprise this old fashioned bounded leather book is an ipad with the menu; classy and new. I loved that this place took the guess work out for me on what to decide on a cocktail. It had the pictures, ingredients, and even the notes of the drinks. You could mark favorites so you can know exactly what you're going to get. The drinks are absolutely amazing and crafted beautifully. But let's not forget about the food. The food is delicious and the presentation is flawless. The shrimp and grits are out of this world and a must try. I highly recommend this place and the staff is knowledgeable and fantastic."}
{"text":"Love the food and the atmosphere.  The waffle cones were delicious( shrimp, tuna and chicken). Loved the tuna poke and the duck flatbread. And my oh my, the truffle fries! Great craft cocktails and an excellent bourbon selection. Over 300 beers!  That being said, the noise level was very loud, even by Charlotte standards."}
{"text":"With all the recent \"craft cocktails/lounge\" additions in Charlotte, The Cellar is still my favorite. Yes, it takes 15 min to get a drink... and if you would rather have it in 5, you probably should go upstairs, where they serve house liquor with a splash of \"random\" from the soda hoes))))  The space is small, on the darker side, and reminds me of old European bars. There is only a limited number is seats available at the bar-meaning it will never get overly crowded. Watching bartenders make the drinks is an experience in itself-they take the art of mixology to the next level. And once you have the Moscow Mule or Asian Pear at the Cellar.... you will find, that other places can only serve you the \"second best\".  I have had a few dinners there as well. Enjoyable food, interesting flavor combinations, but I will not make it my \"destination\" restaurant for dinner.  It is all about the atmosphere and the drinks there."}
{"text":"Update. Still amazing. Still 5 stars. Still in love with every food item on the menu. So let's talk about the beer, baby...  I'm relatively new to the craft beer world, I hid out for a long time in the cider section. (Thank you, thank you, I'm happy to be here...) the Cellar has an INCREDIBLE selection of beers. Charles, the general manager, is super friendly, passionate about craft beer and happy to point you in the right direction. He even gave us a little tour of the Cellar - it wasn't open yet when I was here for the soft opening. I was SO nerdy excited to go into the cellar, where beautiful, unique craft beers live and are kept at 55 degrees, ready to be enjoyed. The whole layout of this dining experience is beautiful. From the exposed brick to the wood and metal accents. I love the feel of this place.  My date and I started our meal with the 2013 Sierra Nevada Narwhal. We ordered the truffle mac and cheese right off the bat while we looked at the other beers and tried to decide on food - so freaking delicious. Towards the end of our meal, Charles told us about a Limited Edition Allagash beer that Duckworth's was only allotted 30 bottles, 6 for each location. They had all 30 shipped to the Cellar. It's called Farm to Face, it's a peach sour - and it's AMAZING. I highly suggest you hunt this beer down before it's gone! Huge props to Charles for recommending it. I also highly suggest chatting up Charles, he's an awesome guy.   Cheers to the Cellar! I'll be seeing you soon!"}
{"text":"Nice dark atmosphere. Food was very good. Wanted to give them a 5 but they are one of those restaurant where \" the food comes out when it is ready\". Therefore I got my food 5 minutes before my wife and about 3 minutes before my son. I had a duck pasta while my son had a steak and my wife had a meat and cheese board. It is just strange and uncomfortable to have to eat while nobody else has food at your table."}
{"text":"Like no other place in Charlotte, The Cellar has blended a speakeasy atmosphere serving phenomenal cocktails with a delicious gastropub. Small plates to the ginormous  Tomahawk steak, all the food is nearly flawlessly executed. I was skeptical when a waiter said their steaks, cooked at 1600 degrees were the best in town. Then I tried one and I consider The Cellar the best steakhouse around now."}
{"text":"We decided to let the excitement die down a little before we checked out The Cellar, but the fella was seriously stoked to finally get there. He's a beer nerd who has traveled thousands of miles for rare beers and has a special love for Duckworth's.  The atmosphere is so cool and laid-back, definitely a dark, speakeasy vibe. Our waiter was really nice and patient - we went with another couple and hung out for about 3 hours! However, we spent those hours doing A LOT of eating and drinking.  We started with the meat and cheese board - 3 meats and 2 cheeses. Everything was good, but the \"wild boar\" tasted a lot like pepperoni. From there, we moved onto the waffle cones. They were an interesting gimmick, but I don't think the sweetness of the cone added anything to the tuna or shrimp cones; however, it did nicely balance out the heat of the sriracha chicken. After that, we tried the brussels sprouts (delicious) and truffle mac & cheese (decadent). For our main, we split two burgers, which were fine, but nothing to write home about. For dessert, we got the S'more and the chocolate torte... when in doubt, go for the S'more all day.  Onto the beer! So, my review is a VERY hopeful 4 stars because their beer selection was just okay. There were one or two semi-rare options, but for the most part, there just wasn't anything crazy unique on tap or in the cellar. However, I'm sure they're building their inventory, so I'll stick with being hopeful. Our waiter also wasn't very smart about beer. When one of us said, \"I like Belgian strong, dark ales - what do you have like that?,\" our waiter had to scan the iPad list and didn't seem to have a great handle on what they had or what would fit that bill.  We'll definitely be back, but we'll hope it just keeps getting better."}
{"text":"I can not tell you how happy I was to visit today! Clean, delicious scratch made food that was full of flavor.  Excellent service! I was waited on like an old friend. I will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"So it looks like I will be in Charlotte for a bit and wanted to start the trip off with some good food and drinks. Was able to meet up with a friend and we decided to hit up the Cellar based on all the rave reviews. Wrapped up work and made the walk over to this joint which you will see by the signs. You do in fact have to walk down the stairs and when I did, I knew it was already going to be good. The greeters are extremely friendly and were happy to accommodate our seating at the bar.   The interior of this joint is pretty slick and definitely has that speakeasy vibe. There are plenty of tables across the sides of the wall, higher tables in the middle, and the seats at the bar itself. The bartenders were super friendly and was very knowledgeable about their drinks. They had a solid selection of whiskeys and I was happy to continue drinking a variety of different whiskeys. The drink menus are provided on an IPAD so it is quick to scroll through your potential options. My friend had a cocktail which he said was spot on and he tried a few other ones saying they were all solid. We decided to order food as well which ended up being the tuna tartare and the burger. The tuna was pretty solid and came with wonton chips which I could not help but sneak a bite even though it was against my diet. It came with guacamole was a good compliment making this an all around solid starter. The burger was solid and the gruyere cheese was the right choice for it. It was cooked right to my liking and was definitely chowed down in no time.  All in all, a good spot with great drink choices, good ambiance, friendly servers, and good food. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I got the scallops dish but they were overlooked. Regardless, all of the other food was so incredible that I'm still giving them 5 stars. My friend got a Mediterranean flatbread that I'm still thinking about. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had an early dinner here on Saturday after an afternoon at Discovery Place.  Since it was too early for us for dinner, we had some craft cocktails at the bar.  I have to say upon our initially seating at the bar, the staff didn't greet us and just passed over our glasses of water without speaking.  However, once we asked about cocktails, the waitress opened up a bit more.  I loved the Cellar Smash!  After our cocktails we sat for dinner in a cozy corner of the dark restaurant.  Ben was our waiter and was absolutely friendly and professional!  He offered suggestions from the menu in which we ordered!  Started with the oysters in creole butter sauce!  AMAZING!  I could have drank a bowl of the creole sauce by itself!  And the grilled baguette was soft and chewy, not hard and difficult to eat like baguettes can often be!  I chose the tuna tartare for my entrée (another suggestion from Ben) which was delicious!  I couldn't figure out the crunchy ingredient on the bottom and guessed it was jicama.  However, Ben said it was green apple!  Never would have put that with tuna but it was a great crunchy texture to the soft tuna!  My husband ordered the hamburger which got a thumbs up and we shared the brussels sprouts.  The brussels sprouts were on the sweet side due to the glaze.  Delicious but we prefer savory over sweet.  My husband was undecided upon a beer with dinner, so Ben organized a beer cellar tour with Charles while our meal was prepared!  He suggested the ideal beer to accompany his hamburger!  How neat is that!  Overall it was a wonderful evening full of yummy cocktails, delicious food and excellent service!  Although we don't eat out much (I love to cook!!), we will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"The tuna tartare was the highlight.  Was a little concerned about shaved apple in the tartare but it was the bomb!    Who knew.  The shrimp and grits was a good spicy version with a liberal use of chili oil.    A cool speakeasy feel adds to the experience.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Outstanding service, great wine selection, 400 wide beer selection, handmade craft cocktails, extensive taps selection -- what more could you ask for?   The Cellar is small so they only take reservations until 6, then first come first serve starts at 7pm. If you play your cards right it's pretty easy to walk in. The ambiance is really romantic, with exposed brick and dim lighting. There's not a bad seat in the house.   The service is outstanding -- the waiters are very helpful and knowledgeable. You never feel rushed out and are encouraged to relax and have a good time! The staff and kitchen are also very accommodating (have an allergy or food intolerance? They're really good at taking care of you and making sure you're experience is great despite the limits).   Pro tip: ask for a tour of the Cellar while you wait on your drinks or food. Since it's tapas style and made fresh to order, everything comes out a different times.   I recommend the duck flatbread, cones, and truffle Mac n cheese!"}
{"text":"Small plates and extensive cocktails are all very tasty. Service staff is fun and friendly. Great experience!"}
{"text":"YUM! If you have not tried The Cellar you really need to! Besides the delish handcrafted cocktails! We loved everything we tried! Drinks are nice and strong as well (so be warned we were feeling it after 2).  Tuna tartar was fabulous and the scallops were SO good! My hubby LOVED his burger. Drink standouts were the Old Acquaintance,  the Queen City Mojito, Smoked Whiskey Sour, Blackberry Julep ALL yummy! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Can't wait to come back to Charlotte just so we can come back here. Was not at all what I expected but was so much better. The music and general vibe were great and everything we ordered was delicious. Service was top notch. Honestly have nothing but good things to say. Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal bartenders, food and service!! In town for work, but I will definitely be back! I had the East Village cocktail, awesome! The seared oysters, awesome! And Filet to top it off. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome drinks, great experience. The truffle mac n cheese was amazing. I had the lamb which was perfect, as well as the truffle fries"}
{"text":"Likes: Their macaroni and cheese was literally the best plate of food I've ever had in my life! I'm not exaggerating. I would like to give this review a 4 instead of a 5 but that Mac 'N Cheese takes it to the next level. It's worth every carb; every intolerance. They have a smoked peach margarita which was incredible but ask for it without the artificial smoke (it's smokey enough without it). The decor and ambiance is excellent. Our server really knew her stuff. The  tacos and candied bacon were tasty. I also liked the brussel sprouts. Dislikes: They lie about their availability. The hostesses intentionally hide the dining room and tell people it's a 45 minute wait with 10+ tables being open. The burger lacked flavor and I  found the s'mores underwhelming."}
{"text":"We were in Charlotte for a girls weekend celebrating two of the girls' birthdays. Darren was our server and he was beyond amazing! He greeted all of us with the biggest smile and had the best personality! He made the birthday girls flowers out of napkins, so cute! The cocktails and food were incredible! Everything is tapas style so it comes out in courses, which was perfect for our group! (We pretty much ordered one of everything.) The staff was so accommodating to all of our needs and requests and we really enjoyed everything so much. I highly recommend, the service, the atmosphere, the food and the amazing craft cocktails, really I can't say enough good things about this place. Ask for Darren, he took our experience to a whole new level"}
{"text":"Dropped in here as a tourist on a busy Saturday night--hoping beyond hope--and guess what?!  The very friendly women said in just 10-15 minutes they could have a table for us.  Yay!   We got our table, waited a bit to be served, but Ben noticed us and chatted with us and got us our server.  The food was brilliant, the tuna tartare definitely was the star of the show,.  My partner was thrilled with the beer list, and every time someone passed by us they stopped to chat about our town--or what beer he likes.  This little place is an outlier for Charlotte city center.  Go here, be weird.  Have fun, and eat great food."}
{"text":"One of my favorites, especially when guests are in town. You will know you made a great choice once you walk down the stairs into the basement. The décor and vibe is true to the speakeasy origin. I first visited on a quiet night and Charles invited us to check out the beer cellar. He went on to describe the exhaustive variety of rare brews. They even have personal lockers for $250 per year - a few were still left.   As with Duckworth's upstairs, the drink menu is on an iPad, making it easy to search and filter results. The cocktails are great and the bartenders are top notch. Cocktails are in the $14 range and the beer varies widely, up to $60.   According to the staff, there is plenty of fascinating history to the location. Apparently some big names have played there, including Prince."}
{"text":"Went here with my guy for our last date night and I have to say it was one of the best yet! We had been talking about going to try this place out for months but never made it in for one reason or another. We actually walked in and totally missed the sign to go downstairs ( I know its called \"the cellar\" AT duckworths but it had been a long day ok) and went straight to the bar that we saw to the right and ordered drinks without questioning our surroundings... like I said it had been a long day... once we realized our surroundings about 3 sips in we made our way downstairs and found a totally different atmosphere from the one above us. It was dimly lit and a small area with tables and a bar. It reminded me of something out of a movie it seemed like such a secret. We sat at the bar like normal and ordered a glass of wine and a beer and the bartender who was also named Lydia showed us a late night menu with options like charcuterie, hummus, tuna tartar and truffle fries. It was outstanding. Yes I was hungry but everything was amazing. I know this because my guy ordered the truffle fries and I. Hate. Truffle. Anything. With a passion. But not these I loved it all. The tuna tartar came with these light and crispy wonton chips and a side of house made guacamole. The hummus which I think was my favorite came with cucumber tomato and feta salad tossed in a vinaigrette and the charcuterie board had options for the normal cheeses and meats we went with a cheddar and gouda and a prosciutto and beef combo.  Now by the time we were done I think our final tab came to about $125 with tip for 4 small plates 2 glasses of wine and 1 beer which I suppose is a little higher than the average place but totally worth every penny. The food the service and the experience was amazing and I cannot wait to go back. Definitely a great spot for a late night date night."}
{"text":"Great meal, cool place. Make reservations if you want a table-but bar is fine. Lots of TVs to watch games. Casual or upscale if you feel like it."}
{"text":"What a great spot to hang out with friends. The ambiance is great, and I don't typically care about that. It has the feel of an old medieval tavern cellar, dark and relaxing. The tapas are unique and tasty. The cocktail selection is excellent, well balanced, and delicious. If you want an relaxing time with friends, laughing, eating, and drinking, this is the spot"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! It's one of my go-to's whenever I am bouncing around town afterwards. Such a fun, lively environment with small plates and tapas (which are my favorite way to dine -- especially before a night out on the town). Highly recommend for a small group or even date night. It can get extremely crowded, but you can easily walk upstairs and grab a cocktail while you wait. The craft cocktails are a superb at The Cellar and there is a huge beer selection on tap for the beer drinkers."}
{"text":"I keep forgetting to try this place and finally got to go last night for after work drinks. We arrived right when they opened and sat at the bar. Our bartender Justin let us ask him obnoxious questions and was super friendly and made great drinks. I even asked for a vodka soda plus something that made it not taste like vodka and he made me a delicious and beautiful drink. He is very talented and really took our visit to the next level. I can't wait to come back and try the food, I've heard great things about the truffle fries. The vibes in here are fun and intimate, and they have the only beer cellar in Charlotte! Great for a date or just if you're feeling a fancy cocktail."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place and finally was able to last Thursday evening.  The atmosphere was speakeasy and upscale yet still laid back.  While waiting for my friends to arrive, I ordered the Mezcul Mule.  Very tasty!  They had a huge selection of cocktails and I was torn because I didn't know which to choose.  What made me really excited though was how hot the bartenders were. Good God! And the suspenders made them even sexier ;)  My friends finally arrive and we are sat immediately at our table.  We decide to just order a bunch of small plates.  We chose the burger, truffle fries, houmus plate, cheese plate, the waffle cones and the lamb chops.  Everything was extremely delicious!  The waffle cones were presented in a board that had 3 holes.  One was tuna, one chicken, and one beef.  The burger was succulent.  The cheeses and meats on the cheese plate were very tasty and the houmus was great as well.  The service also was excellent.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very cool environment, great for date night! Really delicious craft cocktails and a great wine list."}
{"text":"This is in my top 2 favorite restaurants in Charlotte and definitely my favorite \"nice\" restaurant. It's in an old speakeasy and still  has a Prohibition vibe which I loved. I went here for a date night and the food was INCREDIBLE. It absolutely blew me away and was honestly one of the best meals I've ever had in my life. We shared three starters: hand cut truffle fries, truffle mac n' cheese, and the home made waffle cones. Clearly, I love anything truffle flavored but the truffle mac n' cheese was to die for. The waffle cones also had such unique combinations of flavors and I had never had anything like it before (or again). SO SO GOOD. The starters are the real show stopper here. For dinner, I had the filet which was also delicious. In addition to the food, this place is well known for their drinks. They take pride in their cocktails and they live up to the hype. I would reccomend the sazerac."}
{"text":"Came upon this place visiting from Washington, D.C. So glad we did.  Incredible ambience--low lights, natural brick, excellent jazz and bartenders wearing suspenders and ties.  We ordered small plates...they were fantastic. Get the waffle cones! Also, the truffle macaroni and cheese, it is both creamy and deep in its truffle pungent ness.  On to drinks--our bartender was extremely knowledgable and serious about his craft. He shared his knowledge and crafted some perfect cocktails.  All in all, this place is incredible. Up there with the Gibson or the dram in DC if not better.  Tldr: Highly recommend this hip and relaxing speakeasy in the basement of the duck worth. Cheers."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere- Smokey air, dark, chatter, hammering from ice being broken up like back in the day. Fresh juices, unique cocktails, huge beer selection, and impressive wines.  Had the oysters & duck flatbread based off other yelper recommendations. It did not disappoint. Butter scallops and burger were superb. Ended with the French toast- simply amazing. Definitely a not miss for Charlotte diners- amazing culinary experience all around."}
{"text":"Go downstairs, open the sliding door to this underground speakeasy style bar and restaurant. Brick walls, dark wood and darker metal furnishings sit around a lowly lit room. That is the only downside to this place, it's hard to see all the wonderful things they are doing with the food and craft cocktails. Their beer cellar boasts over 500 different brews. We sat at the bar and ordered from tablets that allowed us to star and compare different cocktails, their ingredients, and preparations. Bartenders, with care and flair, pounded ice, lit things on fire, poured flasks, and made phenomenally balanced concoctions. The food was just as good with seared scallops, duck flatbread, and spicy candied bacon. Whether it's just for a drink or a whole meal, just visiting or a regular, you gotta try this place."}
{"text":"What a unique experience!   1) Service was phenomenal. Our waiter knew his stuff! We can tell he loves what he does because he thoroughly explained everything on the menu. No questions needed to be asked.   2) The manager Sean took us to the beer cellar and educated us on the craft beer. We learned a lot. It was an interesting experience.   3) Unique Food menu. Tapas.   4) Restaurant decor was neat.   5) Great place to experience on a date or with friends.   6) Overall experience was amazing- well trained staff!   *highly recommend"}
{"text":"All of the drinks are made from scratch so it takes a long time. And when I say scratch, they are making it with fresh squeezed fruit! They are delicious though. I went there once and got the risotto, it was really good. Also, another tip is to be prepared that this \"cellar\" is basically a basement lol. So it is very warm and dark. May be an issue if you are claustrophobic."}
{"text":"Our airport friend suggested that we come here and based on his previous suggestions we had high expectations. We came in for dinner on a Sunday night, this is a very popular spot so we were happy that we got a table as I don't think they take reservations. The vibe is very different down in the celler than the huge sports bar upstairs. The space is a bit narrow with booths and tables alongside the bar.  They also have a nice wine, vintage beer cellar. Our server Bobby was extremely gracious and helpful! He explained that the cocktails here are all made with natural ingredients that are carefully prepared for each specialty drink and that it might take a while. I got the drink with elderflower and ginger, it took the longest but was definitely worth the wait. We ordered the rabbit parpadelle, scallops, bacon and Brussels sprouts and truffle fries. Overall the food was great, portions were not huge but everything was very tasty. I would definitely recommend coming if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Friday night, not that busy, got my order wrong, took forever getting served. Entire experience was so annoying"}
{"text":"hand down my favorite restaurant/bar in Charlotte.  great service, beer selection, cocktails and food.  they have it all including a dark speakeasy feel.  if you're into craft beer like am, definitely check out the actual beer cellar.  They have an impressive collection for sale, and at reasonable prices.  I go here as often as possible.  make reservations though as this place is small and has gotten very popular.   FYI..they also update their draft beer list (always solid) on Untapped and other apps"}
{"text":"Echoing the reviews....stopped in and when you require a prefect drink, perfect meal this is the place....forget about the money and enjoy living! Fled the state of Florida during Irma and found my way here one evening...the hostess  was quick on the uptalk regarding my status as to a reservation- I smirked a bit and opted for the Bar....in the future offer me options other than a 1 hr wait....  Bartenders (my waiter) was excellent..experimented with a few drinks...ran up an excessive tab of drinks and assorted entrees and couldn't be happier....  I'll be visiting again very soon....excellent job meal and authentic cocktails....."}
{"text":"When you walk in Duckworths, make sure to head downstairs.  I almost thought this restaurant was the Sports Bar.  I'd visit again- decent food and fun place!  Cool atmosphere. A bit loud, and pretty busy for a Thursday night. The hostess could have been more friendly and inviting.  Loved my Pecan bourbon drink!  Got the charred romaine. It was fine.  I liked the dressing a lot.  I wasn't crazy about the toppings.  Also had the burger. It was pretty tasty. Could have done without the caramelized onions- too sweet and didn't pair well with the cheese and bacon flavors of the burger topping."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance of this place.  The food and the cocktails are to die for, and they have a great beer selection.  If you have a big group, I would suggest to call ahead as it can get very busy."}
{"text":"This is a MUST - so much so I went twice! Excellent, Excellent and excellent!!! Candied bacon- spicy sweet and delicious. Ground duck flat bread- it was phenomenal! Tuna tartare was to die for. The drinks are excellent- fresh made no pre made juice! Tons and tons and tons of beer- very rare beers as well!"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday dinner last night and I do not regret it for one second! The waiter (Daren I believe) was VERY knowledgeable. He was super nice and available whenever we needed him. I think we may have ordered almost the entire menu. Lol. We got the charred oysters GET THE CHARRED OYSTERS PLEASE! They were great! The 3 tacos were amazing! The truffle Mac and cheese was okay. The waffle cone thing was GREAT. I didn't really like the tuna cone though. I'm not sure if you can substitute but if you can I'll be getting that again next time! The drinks were amazing l! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've eaten at in Charlotte. The service was excellent, the food was sublime, and the drinks were delicious. The grouper and the scallops were perfect."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and chatted with Robert, who clearly loves his job and the world of drinks. I tried his smoked Old Fashioned (very good and unusual) and a really great Belgian sour beer on tap, which was very good indeed.  Charred oysters were a bit \"ho hum\" with garlic overload. Seared scollops with cauliflower and chorizo were a real stand-out. Great flavor combinations, perfectly cooked scollops.  If you like drinking, then this is a place to go. Whatever you want, they're going to make it for you, and as many beers as anyone could want in one place. I'd happily go back next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We came for dinner as well and would recommend getting 4-5 shareable plates instead of the main dishes. The risotto and tuna tartare were great!"}
{"text":"Decent atmosphere but the food & drinks are average, over priced, and nothing special. I was nice giving 3 stars. Enjoyed my time with friends but probably wouldn't go back. Don't believe the hype."}
{"text":"Delicious food and drinks. Very helpful and friendly staff go above and beyond. And they know stuff too. Really special atmosphere."}
{"text":"Phenomenal and we haven't even eaten there yet!! The atmosphere is phenomenal. I feel like I'm in the movie Goodfellas... Lol! The music is great too. Amanda and Nate are amazing to watch. They truly do put on a show and are so knowledgeable! The drinks are a little pricey but the wine is very reasonably priced (you get what you pay for so stop being cheap) . To me customer service in the past couple years has been dead in restaurants. I know it's impossible to remember everybody's name but whenever we walk in we always get recognized. I'm super picky about wine and cocktails and Nate and Amanda both make a mean FERN BUCK! It is officially now my favorite cocktail and I've had my fair share. Me and my boyfriend can't wait to eat there; I'm sure the rest of our experience will be just as great! Keep it up !!"}
{"text":"Since it was my husband's first trip to Charlotte I thought let me find a spot that is unique for dinner. I made reservations via open table when we got there it was busy but there were open tables in booths and high bar tables. We were seated at a high bar table. I asked if we could be moved and it was explained that the tables were reserved already. An hour later still empty asked for an explanation.. told it was still reserved ... Complained to manager... Btw not just one empty booth table ... There were many ...after we were done eating they asked if we still wanted to move... REALLY.. Maybe we were just too diverse for this restaurant since all three of us were off some color and not Caucasian... Never again.. have never been treated that way but I guess it is the south!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. While we only sat at the bar and had a few cocktails and didn't sample any of the menu, the drinks themselves were incredible. The fresh ingredients and artistry that goes into every single cocktail they make is like nothing I've seen or heard about before. If you want a different bar feel, come to this speakeasy  type bar, discreetly located under the Duckworth restaurant and be blown away by their incredible service and menu."}
{"text":"A superb dining experience! Everything from the ambiance, to the service, to the food was top notch. The cocktails and dishes (oh which we had five, three appetizers and two entrees) were all excellent. One of the best meals I've ever had in Charlotte. I've already told numerous people that it should go to the top of their must-go list. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I loved everything about it!! The atmosphere was wonderful and the food far exceeded my expectations!!! Garett was an amazing server. I will visit again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure if the bartender's name, but he displayed great service all around. Guys next to me were grade A douchebags. And bartender made up for the entire experience. Be sure to try the candied bacon!!"}
{"text":"Awesome low key vibe, exactly what they are going for...20's era speakeasy.  Great food, huge beer selection in bottle, great drink selection, and great service."}
{"text":"We came to Charlotte somewhat unexpectedly (thank you Hurricane Irma) and turned to Yelp for recommendations. I trust Yelp in general, but you never really know until you visit the establishment. The Cellar lived up to its 4+ stars recommendations. The drinks were delicious. I totally recommend the Cellar Smash if you like ginger, but it also has hints of herbal flavors paired with Citrus and Elderflower in the ice that's used to make it! Genius. The food was crazy good also. I completely recommend this place and will definitely return next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place. Ate at the bar, and the servers, Sam and Chloe, were terrific. They took great care of me, including finding me a pair of cheaters when I discovered I'd left my glasses at home. I had the roasted brussel sprouts and the scallops with roasted corn and cauliflower. Both were very tasty. I love the bar and the prohibition vibe. I will most definitely come back the next time I'm in Charlotte. TIP: The Cellar is quite dark. The drink list is on an ipad, so that's easy to read. The menu is another story. For now, until they upload the menu onto an ipad  (which would be a serioulsy great idea), you'll need the flashlight feature on your phone."}
{"text":"What a nice addition to the uptown dining scene, and quite unexpected just below a Sports bar literally glowing from the TVs mounted everywhere!  Take a walk down the stairs at the front door and see what I mean.  Talk about a contrast: The ambiance from the moment the hostess slides open the wooden door is dark and moody, highlighted with tiny candle lights. It definitely has the feel of a hidden Speakeasy the requires a secret knock to find.  Bare brick walls, exposed metal and lots of dark wood set the scene before a large and serious cocktail bar for specialty drinks.  And, yep, craft cocktails are their jam here.  Handcrafted everything, blow torches and glasses filled with smoke, fresh herbs for muddling, square blocks of ice.... you get the scene.  But that's not all, they also have a dozen or so beer taps for your \"harder to find\" craft beer scene.  Highland's Cold Mountain Winter Ale, for example, both from the keg AND from the cask.  They also have a beer vault for the serious collector you can request to peruse as well.  In short, this is not a place to skip the drinks, this is half of what the space is all about.  The other half of this concept is about the food, where the trend of small plates to be shared continues throughout the majority of the menu, though a small entree selection is available as well.  Meats and cheeses, salads, and a number of inventive hot and cold tapas type foods dominate here.  Just be aware- food comes out as it is ready, so pacing can be hot or miss here if you are trying to work thru a number of different plates.  Highlights include the truffle mac and cheese and house made waffle cones served in a 3-pack with a range of different fillings- from cole poke style tuna to a sweet & spicy Sriracha chicken.  Though I haven't tried them, they also have a s'mores dessert and a chocolate torte that would make this place a fine stop just for an after-dinner or show drink and sweet bite.    Great for a date, or even an after-work gathering of friends or co-workers.  Just be aware no reservations after 7- it's first come first-served."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Make reservations; I had to book about 3 weeks in advance for a party of 2 at 6 pm. Darren is a spectacular server, gave us a tour of the beer \"vault\", and took excellent care of us. The drinks are amazing, and every bite of food was perfection.  Our orders for the night (abbrev. names): oysters, truffle fries, scallops, duck ragu, tomahawk ribeye, s'more, and french toast.  Darren warned us that drinks would take a bit longer due to complexity, but were always completely worth the wait. Prices were very reasonable for high quality of both food and drinks."}
{"text":"The Cellar is a wonderful place for both food and drink. They have a small, but delightful Scotch selection, with Monkey Shoulder being one that I had never tried before and was a great surprise. The food was unique. The waffle cones were interesting and the octopus was grilled very well.   The only complaint is the wait. We were told it was a 40 minute wait, but ended up waiting over an hour for a table. Other than that, the Cellar was fantastic and I'll be back."}
{"text":"After searching for a good cocktail, I finally found one, or two, or three here at The Cellar at Duckworths. Seriously best cocktails in town. Also, delightful staff. I will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"My gf and I went there for the first time last night. Everything was wonderful. Our server was Patrick and he was very knowledgeable about all aspects of the menu and the history of the building. We had no idea The it was the anniversary of the repeal of prohibition so it was definitely alive and bustling crowd. We started with some charcuterie and some tapas. Everything was amazing. Now I know that this place is founded on their wonderful mixology but this food is amazing. My gf wasn't loving the mojito so we stuck with some wine. By the way, that's just her I'm sure mojito drinkers would have enjoyed it, opinions vary Anyway, we moved onto our entrees and I went with the grouper while she went with the scallops. My grouper was just what I wanted. Not a lot of buttery sauce like most places. Just some delicious grilled fish. But her scallops, insane good. That touch of turmeric was amazing. Hands down, the best scallops I've had in quite a while. I can't suggest this place enough. They also have a beer cooler that will amaze. I didn't have an opportunity to go inside but there are tours and it gives us another surprise when we go back."}
{"text":"Awesome experience! Great find under a sports bar in Uptown. It felt like we stepped back in time to the 1920's before and even during Prohibition, from the decor to the music. We sat at the bar and ordered a couple cocktails. The bartenders were super friendly and all the drinks were made with high quality ingredients. The food is tapas style and tasted fresh. We got the smoked salmon flatbread and balsamic brussels. Both were excellent. We will be back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. The vibe is awesome and the service is really great and attentive. But the food underwhelmed me. I sat at the bar and started off with a mule that was made perfectly. Super fresh taste. I ordered something else that I didn't love and they promptly replaced it. I ordered everything at once, but since it's tapas, it came out when it was ready. First the char-grilled oysters came out. They were delicious! There was only 5, but they serve you like 8 pieces of bread. Seems a bit wasteful. Next came the duck ragu. It was not what I was expecting at all. I've realized I do not prefer ground duck, you really lose the taste in my opinion. The overall dish was just a bland creamy pile of noodles on my plate. It was ok, but it needed seasoning. Lastly came the roasted Brussels sprouts. And again, they were just ok. I felt like there was too much balsamic and it really overpowered the taste of the sprouts, which I love on their own. And I didn't love the red onion, they just felt like an afterthought. Overall, they get 4 stars for ambiance, drinks, service, and oysters. The ragu and Brussels left a lot to be desired. If I could do 3.5 Stars, I would..."}
{"text":"Incredibly loud. Do not go for a quiet romantic evening but more for bar scene. Food and even drinks arrive at table at different times which is a bit disconcerting. Service is friendly otherwise. Tapas menu a bit limiting, but everything we ordered was delicious including the cocktails."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go in Charlotte for a special occasion. To celebrate our recent engagement, our friends took us here for dinner and cocktails. When you arrive, they give you an ipad to browse through their drink menu and you can mark things you are interested in. It was hard to pick just one but the waitress was very helpful in describing the drinks and making recommendations. I wound up ordering the French Buck to drink which included gin, prosecco, and a nice citrusy flavor. Their beer list is also killer!  For food, we ordered tapas for the table: the lamb, the truffle mac and cheese, the tuna tartare (a favorite we get every time), and the ground duck flatbread. Everything was amazing! The lamb in particular was really good... even our Irish friend who is super picky about his lamb said \"it's not bad for lamb in America\" and his fiance said he's never said that before, so I consider that a major win.  Since we were celebrating, our waitress surprised us with a smore's dessert on the house! This included a dragon's milk ganache, marshmallow puff, and graham cracker. SOOO yummy.   This is an amazing experience every time we go and is worth every penny."}
{"text":"Came to town for business and had big group.  Saw the nice reviews on Yelp so I booked it for all of us. The place did not disappoint.  Very cool vibe downstairs with great food and drinks.   Had a very tasty grouper and the candied bacon app was truly special.   Tried my friend's ribeye which was well seasoned and the truffle fries, Mac and cheese and sprouts were all very good.  Everyone really enjoyed all aspects of the Cellar...it even made it to my bookmark list for next time in town."}
{"text":"This was my best experience ever at a restaurant. I can't speak highly enough of my dining experience at The Cellar at Duckworth's. For starters it is in the basement, beneath a bar. As spooky as that sounds, it's equally exciting, and cool. You are lead downstairs where you enter an actual cellar. The ambiance is as romantic an environment as I've ever encountered, from the dim lighting, to the small, intimate setting... I only wish that my GF could've been there with me. I won't lie, the tables are a little closer than I would've liked, but that doesn't take away from the incredible experience, service, and food.   I promise you this, I will dine at The Cellar every single time I visit Charlotte, NC.   It was that good."}
{"text":"All the reviews were right! Fantastic experience thanks to Darrin our awesome waiter and Nate, the fantastic manager. Food choices were perfect. Signature cocktails were impressively made and quite tasteful! A must go! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"One of the most impressive beer selections I've ever encountered! You can get 5 or 12 oz pours of anything on draft (I love having the option of smaller pours so I can try more). They also had a large beer cellar and some of the bottles were available to take home! The waiter and bartender were not only knowledgeable about beer but clearly paying attention to my preferences and making very appropriate recommendations. We also really enjoyed their s'mores dessert!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in CLT. Great food, ambiance and drinks. The only downside is that they have minimal seating and fill up quickly."}
{"text":"Great menu and service.  Possibly the most underrated in the city.  Cocktails are on another level, with southern comfort foods all over the menu.  Service was top notch.  Ask for Bobby!"}
{"text":"\"Our bartender can make you anything you want\" ... \"Okay, I'll have a chocolate cherry martini\" What kind of vodka do you like?, Tito's? ... \"Yeah, sure... Great\"  The bill comes and there's a $12 Jameson charge and a $3 cherry charge and a $2 chocolate charge.  Hooray, A $17 whiskey drink my wife didn't order.  Brown liquor makes her angry.  $17 drinks makes me angry."}
{"text":"The ambiance was realllly nice. They had some really crafty cocktails which were made well. Server was super knowledgeable and spot on with his recommendations."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday last night and had the BEST service from Darren. We got a tour of the cellar, talked about beer and the restaurant, and really enjoyed his company.   Truffle fries are to die for. Charcuterie is heavenly - love the chocolate lab and the presentation. Anything we've gotten on the menu has been great - highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We Got into Charlotte 2 days ago, Ate at a couple of places and nothing was remarkable. Till last night.   We caught a late concert and walked in at about 11pm. The place has a nice dark atmosphere and the patrons seemed to be having a good time.   Our Waiter was Marshal. Although clearly he was busy, he made it a point to make us feel comfortable as soon as we were seated.  Great server! Ask for him. He knows his stuff!  To start we had the pan seared oysters. Omg, get them!  I had the Pastrami fried Hangar Steak. The polenta was the best I've ever had and the steak was perfectly cooked (med rare).   She had the Tuna tartar as an entree. It was the best we've ever tasted. Melt in your mouth, sushi grade tuna. Mouth watering.   They have a funky cocktail menu and the drinks were strong yet delicious.   All in all, we HIGHLY recommend The Cellar"}
{"text":"I don't have a bad thing to say about this place. They have awesome attentive service, the cocktails can sometimes take a little bit longer but that's because of what they all entail... the atmosphere is adorable, very industrial, perfect lighting, really reminds you of a speakeasy. It's a small place, so if you're doing dinner you may want a reservation. The bar tender who was there both times I have been was definitely on point- he took note of a certain way I ordered my Manhattan and then took some creative liberties to make it an even better one- I love this. We went on new years and had an awesome waiter, the food is really great. This is a great date spot... Yup, just go."}
{"text":"Loved it. Food was awesome. I really enjoy a place that is different from the rest. Wasn't sure what to expect walking down into a basement but the food was amazing. Craft cocktails were awesome too. They take the time out to fresh squeeze and grind ingredients right at the bar. Good service. Got my food in record time."}
{"text":"Duckworths was very good!  I came on St Patrick Day and it was pack! The  customer service was great! Justin my server was very good!  I really enjoy myself! I will come back again!!"}
{"text":"Late review, but went here with a friend. First time! But it was amazing! Not only is the atmosphere neat, but our bartender was fantastic!! He was super friendly and made killer drinks! Had the waffle cone app which was out of this world. I would definitely recommend this place and will positively come back! Would suggest to get there early to be seated at the bar. We were one of the first ones there, so we were seated right away. But overall experience was great."}
{"text":"The cellar at duckworth's used to be one of my favorite stops in uptown. That was until the bartenders and management became more hipster than the regular crowd. They announce last call at 1:15am on a Saturday night when they are supposed to close at 2am. Sounds to me like a place that is too lazy to want good tips from a loyal crowd. I would definitely not recommend wasting your time with this particular location, coming from a previous loyal regular. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"OMG, where has this place been all my life? It's in uptown Charlotte and I cannot express to you all how awesome this place is. This is a mysterious gastropub beneath the sporty Duckworth taproom.  Go down the staircase and ask for Nickie, the best mixologist in all the land.  All of the drinks are hand crafted, shaken, and poured to perfection.  This speakeasy features premium beers in a cold cellar with options to buy a locker to hold these exclusive brews.  Some of them are even aged like fine wines and pack a punch and cost a pretty penny.    The smoked whisky sour, mezcal mule and the old fashioned were so delicious.  It takes about seven to ten minutes to craft all the drinks but each one has fresh ingredients and love infused.  You won't be disappointed!  The truffle Mac and cheese is LITERALLY THE BEST I've ever had in a restaurant.  It's so rich and hearty and may be shared.  The ribeye steak was yummy too.     Don't hesitate to try this sexy, smooth bar the next time you are out on the town!"}
{"text":"Had dinner and drinks at The Cellar At Duckworth's on Sunday night. For drinks we had Where There's Smoke, Smoked Buttered Pecan Old Fashioned, and a Classic NY Gin Sour. To eat we shared the Ground Duck Flatbread, Tuna Tartare, and Butter Basted Scallops.  Quality The Cellar At Duckworth's turned out to be one of the highlights of my short trip to Charlotte. Excellent drinks and outstanding food in a very stylish environment. We started the evening my each selecting a cocktail, I went with the Smoked Buttered Pecan Old Fashioned. It was probably my least favorite of the cocktails I tried, but still very fun. I would recommend saving it for after dinner, as it is quite sweet. My girlfriend started with Where There's Smoke, a spicy smoked peach margarita. It was delicious and came with a real kick. Before the evening was over we also had a Classic NY Gin Sour, which combined gin, rhone wine, lime, simple syrup and egg whites in a fun and flavorful concoction. And while I came in expecting some tasty drinks, it was the food that really impressed. First, I had some of the delicious Ground Duck Flatbread, which came with duck, sun-dried tomato, pear, mushroom, and a balsamic fig reduction. Next was the Tuna Tartare, which came with a generous portion of fresh tuna, topped with sesame seeds and chili oil. On the side came chunky guacamole and wonton crisps. Mixed together was a fresh, rich, sweet, and spicy bite. Then there was the Butter Basted Scallops, which I believe are a must order. Served with this mix of currants, cauliflower, turmeric, and chorizo, the accompaniments were nearly as good as the main attraction.  Quantity The drinks were a good size and contained a fair amount of alcohol. For food I came in expecting more snacks than meals, but each dish was large and hearty.  Value Expect to pay around $15 for the signature cocktails, which was high, but not unreasonably so. The food meanwhile varies greatly as they have plenty of appetizers and snacks in the under $15 range, but also large plates from $30 to $60.  Ambiance The Cellar At Duckworth's is located in the Uptown area of Charlotte. This speakeasy-style bar and restaurant is nestled beneath a more casual restaurant in Duckworth's. To enter you first walk down a set of stairs to meet a host in the dimly lit waiting area. The walls are brick and a large sliding door blocks the restaurant itself. When it is your turn to enter they slide the door open and you enter the tightly packed dining area with a long bar on the far wall. Everything about the space has been carefully constructed to make it look and feel like a prohibition era secret space. Wood and bricks give the basement an unfinished look, but also stylistic charm. Dim lights hang from the wall, but allow strategically placed candles to do the work. Towards the back they have a storage room full of their large beer collection. The music is a mix of jazz and R&B and the the staff are dressed very dapper. It is a fun spot and one that fully embraces the spirit of the 20s.  Crowd It is a small space and on weekend evenings it fills up fast. Since we did not have reservations we were relegated to the last seats in the bar area. I highly recommend making advance reservations, because if we had showed up even a few minutes later we likely would have had a long wait. Also, do not be fooled by the casual sports bar on the ground floor, the cellar is much more sophisticated and intimate. It makes for a nice date spot or a location when trying to impress.   Service The host did not make the best impression, but everyone else in the place was incredible. The girls behind the bar were delightful and very enthusiastic about the drinks they were creating. It was also clear that everyone from the bartenders to the waiters, believed in what the restaurant was doing. They beamed as they described the selection of high quality beer, great unique cocktails, and awesome food.  Parking Located in the Uptown area of Charlotte, we made the walk over from our hotel. However, I saw a paid lot across the street and a few garages in the area.  Extra The Cellar At Duckworth's is simply great. Drinks, food, service, and style all make it a wonderful place for dinner and cocktails. Just make sure you grab reservations because the magic of this secret bar is definitely not a secret around town."}
{"text":"Oh gosh I have been waiting to write this review since my first bite! Be prepared for lots of gushing about this place. We visited Charlotte for the weekend and let me tell you this place ruins all other places. Wish we'd skipped 5church the night before and ate here all weekend! We were promptly seated with a reservation on a calm Sunday evening.  Atmosphere-small, perfectly dim with nice lighting, calm but a good vibe. We felt free to talk and laugh but we could still hear each other!  Service-Our server, Bobby, was both incredibly kind, and informed. He was ready with suggestions, full descriptions of all drinks and food, and checked in just enough. We were never waiting for a refill, and his suggestions were great. The GM also checked in and gave us a tour of the beer collection, a must see. Ask about the private lockers! Drinks- We were beginning to think no one in Charlotte knew how to make a bourbon drink. So happy to be proved wrong here! We bonded with the GM over visiting bourbon distilleries in Kentucky. I had the Smoked Whiskey Sour, my boyfriend had the Old Fashioned. Both were incredible and perfectly prepared. We finished our meal with the Vieux Carré...the best bourbon drink I've had.  Food-We started the evening with the truffle mac n cheese. The couple next to us suggested this was life changing. They weren't wrong, the perfect blend of truffles, Gouda, and smokiness. We finished the whole rich dish, and it's plenty to share between two. I ordered the Duck Ragu, and my boyfriend the filet mignon. The Duck Ragu had thin wide noodles, perfect ground Duck, sun dried tomatoes all in a garlic cream sauce. Rich and delicious. The real star here though is the filet...perfect medium cook but this amazing crispy char on the outside. It was served with a light salad and a peppercorn sauce. Every bite was perfect. We decided to drink our dessert so I can't speak to that, but I'm sure it matches the level of the food. The price is also right, for this level of food quality we were very impressed with the pricing. We would return to Charlotte just to dine here again. Bravo!"}
{"text":"The food is good bar food, but on the pricey side.  Their wings with the house made sauce is by far my favorite item on the menu.    Beer selection is top notch.  Not only do they have the best of all the locals they have a huge list of other domestic breweries including Wicked Weed.  I have had great luck with the servers as well having decent knowledge of what to try.  Pricing is also a bit high, but their specials are usually decent.    On football Sundays they have $4 mimosas and bloody marys.  They also usually have a $3.50 beer special.  There are tons of Tvs and a good crowd as well.  The bad is the management isn't very accommodating on seating - your whole party needs to be there before you can sit .  Yea that protects them from no shows but it makes it hard for people to plan ahead.  They also don't give any leeway to repeat customers - so loyalty seems to mean little.  And don't ask for tvs to be changed downstairs - not going to happen."}
{"text":"The Cellar at Duckworth's is a hidden gem! This was my second visit to the Cellar and my friends and I couldn't be more pleased. From the hostess welcome to the service provided at the bar everything was outstanding. This restaurant has very dim lighting, be prepared to whip out your phone to view the menu. The drink menu is featured on a well-lit iPad.    I would highly recommend dining at the bar. You'll enjoy watching the mixologist craft together the perfect cocktails. The food and drinks are amazing! We ordered the Hand Cut Truffle Fries, Truffle Mac & Cheese, and the Shrimp & Grits. The Shrimp and Grits."}
{"text":"Was very impressed! I love the feel and atmosphere. I got the cellar smash to start with and my sister got a mule. Both were fantastic. Sitting at the bar gives you the opportunity to watch these bar tenders take their craft very seriously.   We got the truffle fries, tuna tartar and shrimp and grits. All were great. My only recommendation is to have more gluten free options on your menu, but they were very accommodating about finding some choices. Will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"Don't be turned away by the sport bar, go down the stairs to find inspired drinks and amazing food. We had the ground duck pizza and oysters for starters, both awesome. Followed with risotto, pasta and the ribeye. The ribeye was cooked exactly like we asked and with very little marinade, showing the great quality of the beef. Great beer and wine selection."}
{"text":"Drinks are amazing! Take a while but worth it. The ambience is great for dates/groups, can actually hear conversations. Great speak easy feel. Food was okay and took a very long time to come out and was cold so I don't think it was worth the prices. The cornflake dessert was yummy though. I'd return for the drinks only."}
{"text":"If you're trying to eat at Cellar make sure you go downstairs as this is below Duckworth's in Uptown. You'll know you're in the right spot if it's a speakeasy vibe and not a regular bar. Some of the things we ordered were the brussel sprouts, truffle mac and cheese, tuna tartare, and scallops. My favorite thing that I go was the tuna tartare. It came out like a block and you chipped away at it with the chips. It is a bit pricey though, but it's worth it for the ambiance."}
{"text":"I don't think there's a single restaurant in Charlotte I've frequented more often and it never disappoints.  Great service, amazing food (extra love for the risotto and waffle cones), love the ambience, but I always say I come back for the Cellar Smash-- a must have for St. Germain lovers."}
{"text":"Awesome, attentive service, not a huge menu, but executed flawlessly.  I will be back (went two times in my 5 day trip).  Don't confuse this with the restaurant upstairs, which in it self it very good, but has a more basic pub menu and 50+ beers on tap."}
{"text":"A few friends and I stopped in here after hearing they have a great selection of limited release bottled beers.  Wow, this is not your normal Duckworth's!  It's actually in the cellar of the Uptown Duckworth's but the atmosphere is so different than upstairs. It's like a speakeasy. They even have the door closed to make it seem all hush hush.  Inside this part of the restaurant, it's quite dark. It looks fancy but most of their customers were in shorts when I was here so don't think you have to come here in a suit and tie.   Just like upstairs, the beer menu is on an Ipad which make it easier to read. They also have a cellar of the limited release bottles and you have to ask permission to go in as there needs to be a staff member with you. There are first release Wicked Weed beers, Allagash, Dragon's Milk and so many more.  The only problem is that many of these beers you have to drink onsite.   Food is quite different here than upstairs with a more upscale menu. I had the Tilefish which was delicious and also ordered a salmon flatbread which arrived cold. The manager explained this is how it is supposed to be served but it would have been nice to see that mentioned on the menu. If I had read that, it would not have been ordered.  The staff was great here. So much different than some of my experiences at another Duckworth's.   Overall a very good experience. My only complaints were the lighting which was a little too dark and the menu item not listed as cold. But those aren't enough to stop me from coming for the beer!"}
{"text":"I'm knocking a star off due to the hostess asking me if I wanted to sit at the bar even though I had made a reservation for #tableforone. The food and service was very good though. I enjoyed the lamb pappardelle and the tuna tartare. Both very good."}
{"text":"Came for a few drinks and appetizers. The appetizers were good, Not great the drinks were VERY GOOD. I had the ny gin sour and it was fantastic. Even the non-gin drinkers ended up ordering it. Cool vibe, sports bar up stairs, mixology bar downstairs. Would go again"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was dark and truly cellar like, but comfortable and cute. The food was absolutely outstanding. I had the lamb and my friends had the scallops and we all three ordered different desserts to share. I highly recommend the French toast! The service was great, they were attentive without being too overbearing. My only complaint was the noise level, I had to almost scream at my friends across the table. I would recommend getting a reservation and going earlier in the evening to avoid the noise."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a late dinner on Tuesday night; the atmosphere in the Cellar is in stark contrast to the sportsbar upstairs - dark wood, brick walls, a cozy, speakeasy feel.  Definitely my speed.  Food was spectacular; I was looking on the light side and went with the taco trio and an asparagus salad.  Just a bit too much food for one person, but a single plate alone wouldn't have done it.  Service was great - good conversation about beer and local whiskey, and an all around good staff.  But the beer list...  oh, the beer list.  Best bottle list I've ever seen, and that's actually saying a lot.  It's not IPA-heavy, which is not a bad thing - ~450 bottles, some of which are vintage, and a great selection of local vintage stouts and barleywines.  It's pricey, but if you're a beer geek you must stop here."}
{"text":"Classic Speakeasy bar with fantastic food. Cocktails are fantastic also!  Ambiance provides for a great a vibe and the bartenders are skilled in making any cocktails.  Love their Old Fashioned And Whiskey Sour, would also recommend their Bread Pudding."}
{"text":"Wow! Speechless! A hidden gem below Duckworth's Sports Bar. Was apparently an old speakeasy so be sure to inquire about the history and also take a tour of the beer cellar. Very sexy and swanky vibe. Our entire experience was fantastic. The service was excellent! Patrick our server was AMAZING and the manager Shawn even stopped by our table. Tapas style appetizers the brussel sprouts, mac & cheese and hand cut fries were delicious and very rich. Excellent choices for the wine we ordered- impressive wine list in addition to their massive beer selection and craft cocktails. Apparently their stand out entree is their burger and it's no secret as every table had someone who ordered it. I also couldn't help notice the desserts! We didn't get one but from the looks of it the frosted flake French toast was a customer favorite and it smelled delicious!"}
{"text":"I wrote previously how this place was closed and I got feedback that they don't close or rent out for private events.  They did but they don't do it anymore.  They closed the entire place for the CIAA tournament two years in a row, I happened to be headed there during the time of both of these tournaments.  What are the odds?  I had friends in town for the tournament one year so I wanted to take them here.  Someone from the establishment commented they don't close for private events, that turned out to be a false statement.  They had closed for private events and they closed down the entire building not just the cellar, but closing all of the building necessarily means you also closes the individual parts.  I am going to give the cellar another chance.  If they are closed or unavailable due to being overcrowded, or something like that I am reverting to my previous stance that this place has availability problems."}
{"text":"This is always in our pocket as a \"go to\". The service at the bar is friendly and the food at this Duckworth's far surpasses any of the others in the area. And,  we have tried nearly all of them! The nachos - if you ask for extra chili and extra cheese, that is what you will get. Piping hot. And the wings are always cooked to perfection. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because they don't always have a cider other than Angry Orchard available. For a tap house, they should."}
{"text":"Everyone at the table agreed this was their new favorite spot in Charlotte. The food, the drinks, the service (ask for Darren), all were outstanding."}
{"text":"Very surprised and equally disappointed.  First and last visit.  You know something is wrong when you sit at the bar and don't get greeted by your bartenders.  We were 2 out of a total of 6 people at the bar and there were 2 bartenders.  Wow."}
{"text":"This place is so great! It's extremely unique with delicious entrees, and very interesting drinks. Would definitely come again to try more! The atmosphere is very nice, but a little dark. The staff was very attentive and quick. Was an awesome experience!"}
{"text":"This place is what you would expect from Uprown Charlotte! Everything is cooked to order, libations are fantastic and the staff, wow they are great. The sound system went down and our waiter Sean gave us his iPhone to play Rat Pack music at the table which we shared with the neighboring table. The beer cellar isn't something you see everywhere. I'd guess there are only 3-4 in the country like this one! If you are in to good service, fantastic atmosphere and exceptional food this must be a stop in Uptown Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This is an intimate spot - it is dimly lit and cozy, but all it a very positive way. We had about 10-12 people for a dinner party and the service was still amazing even with our large party. All of the drinks were sublime and the food was fantastic. Absolutely recommend, and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Hand crafted cocktails were amazing as well as the customer service and the food. Highly recommend and am looking forward to the next time I am in town so I can come back."}
{"text":"Had a great time here.  The only reason I withhold a star was that it was a new place for me, in a new town.  I WILL be back in May with bells on.    The drink menu looked amazing (and pricey, but you get what you pay for).  I highly recommend the brussels and duck flatbreads to share, as well as a Cellar tour.  Don't come in a rush please.  This is more of an experience than filling your belly.  The oysters got rave reviews, but since I live where oysters practically beat down the door to be eaten they were not on my to-do list.  It is a cool vibe and if I were a local it would be part of my regular scene (and possibly a 5-star).  Never noticed any desserts on the menu, but it could be because who needs desserts when a bite of sprouts is better than the best bananas foster?"}
{"text":"I love coming here.  We went on Friday night and it was packed.  We put our name on the waiting list and went upstairs to the bar.  Great beer selection upstairs, over 140 beers on tap.  After a few, they called us downstairs and we waited at the bar until our table was ready. Nate, the bartender  (it was his last night) was so helpful with suggestions.  I had a gin mojito with Uncle Vals gin, it was so good.  Everyone behind the bar was so friendly.  Then a table opened up in Darren's section.  We had had him before as our waiter.  He is good!  Knows the menu, makes great food and wine suggestions.  We had the charred oysters, delicious!! a salad, then their steak.  Great way to celebrate our 38th anniversary.  I can't wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick, fast dinner. Was hoping to dig into some delicious food and unique drinks but was sorely disappointed.  House Made Waffle Cone: 2/5 Despite being advertised as Ponzu Poke, it was probably soy sauce instead, and as a result was salty AF. The chicken sriracha was again, way too salty. The only decent cone was the coconut shrimp. Disappointing.  Roasted vegetables: 3/5 Nothing special. I should have ordered a salad instead because it was drowning in oil.  Duck flatbread: 3/5 Basically duck dust sprinkled onto some flatbread. This was probably the best out of the 3 dishes, but not something I'd recommend.  Our server recommended me a drink that he promised he's \"never had a lady say they didn't like.\" Unfortunately it tasted like Fanta + champagne. Meh. Guess I'll be the first to say it, but I'm sorry, I just didn't like it...or maybe I'm just not a lady :(  Perhaps we just came on an off night? Hope so..."}
{"text":"This is the place to go. The cocktails are spot on and their charred oysters were the most delicious thing I ate in all of NC. I can't wait to take my NY friends to this place when they visit. The best service we had in Charlotte by far. Two of the waiters are from NY. Patrick was from Brooklyn and has an uncle that worked with my wife's uncle in the NYPD almost 35 years ago. Another waiter grew up in Middle Village around the corner from father!  It was meant to be."}
{"text":"If you're going to splurge, this is the place to do it. Make a reservation or get there EARLY; this place fills up on weekdays. The experience is truly one of a kind. Take the tour of the beer cellar - it's the only one (or 1 of 2) in the country. All of their drinks are made with fresh ingredients and worth the wait to watch them prepare each piece of the delicious cocktail. It's a tapas style restaurant too, so sharing is caring. My group had the truffle fries (a MUST have), truffle mac and cheese, and we each had a filet. The BEST filet I've ever had. We finished with the s'mores dessert - soooo good. Daron was the server and was truly a master of his craft. He was so personable and knowledgeable, I almost wished he joined our party at the table. If you go, ask for him, he will take great care of you, recommend drinks and dishes, and keep your water glass filled (a must for me)."}
{"text":"The Cellar at Duckworth's is the bees knees! The cats pajamas! The bomb diggity and all that jazz. The dimly lit underground space makes you feel like you're part of some kind of exclusive dinner club in the 1920's. Except there are iPad menus, so you know it's modern day.   My husband and I started off with a flight of Founder's Kentucky Breakfast Stout ranging from years 2013 to 2016. It's amazing how different each stout tasted from year to year. All delicious! All distinct! And such a fun concept.   I also got a blackberry mescal which was a play on a Moscow Mule. There was some lovely smokiness to this drink (this place is known for their smoked cocktails- try one!)  Honestly, we were pretty tipsy by the time we decided on food. So we ordered SO MUCH FOOD. Too much food, almost...  HOUSE MADE WAFFLE CONES: 3 cones stuffed with 1. ponzu poke tuna, 2. coconut shrimp, and 3. sriracha honey chicken ($15). These handheld treats were so fun and so good. My favorite was the coconut shrimp, but they were all yummy.   HAND CUT TRUFFLE FRIES: made with parsley, parmesan and with a side malt vinegar aioli ($9). The malt vinegar aioli was out of this world. Why isn't this more of a \"thing\"?! It's genius!   SAFFRON FETTUCCINE: with charred octopus, bbq fig sauce, arugula, and a country olive reduction. ($15). I was a little taken aback when I saw an in-tact octopus tentacle on my plate, but alcohol makes me brave. This was an absolutely delicious dish. The octopus was cooked perfectly and the hand-made fettuccine was some of the best I ever tasted. The BBQ fig sauce added the perfect touch of sweetness. The olive flavor was fairly prominent, so maybe skip this if you don't like olives.   PASTRAMI MARINATED HANGER STEAK: with  chimichurri and polenta frites. ($19). My husband really enjoyed this. I snuck a couple bites and the meat was flavorful and tender.  I have to gush about the attentive, knowledgeable and kind service we received all night. Our waiter was more than willing to hear our preferences and offer suggestions. He even suggested some places to check out in Charleston once he found out that's where we were heading. We also got to meet and chat with the GM. He brought us on a tour of the beer cellar where we were able to marvel at the extensive beer selection. What a great guy!   Next time we're in Charlotte, we'll be back to visit."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place. I love the speakeasy feel and would love to see more in Charlotte. I had the Cellar Smash and I loved it. It's a great place to chill with friends with a low key atmosphere.   It's a low lighting, high end cocktail bar. We didn't try the food but I can only imagine it is as good as the cocktails.   Looking for something different? Come here. Get that laid back locale with great drinks!"}
{"text":"My friend and I shared several apps and one entree. The bar staff was great! We had the truffle Mac and cheese, Brussels sprouts and the waffle cones from the starter menu. The Brussels sprouts were amazing!! We also split the scallops which were very good."}
{"text":"Drinks - good Food - good and bad Price - expensive Decor - good Service - non-existent All in all - meh  Had to sit at bar because restaurant was full with reservations. There were about a dozen open tables when we entered and about ten open tables when we left.   Service was non-existent. Not bad, just non-existent. Had to initiate talking with bartender for everything during our meal, why are we tipping?  Mac and cheese was delicious. Steak was good. Burger was burnt and no good. Could only stomach half.   Based on what we got, definitely expensive. If I pay a lot I expect immaculate service and amazing food.    All in all, I'm sure this place is better than what we got. Wouldn't return for a while."}
{"text":"A unique place with a nice selection of beers, good cocktails, wine and food. A nice place to chill!"}
{"text":"Handcrafted cocktails, rare beers, amazing food. If you're trying to go out for vodka waters and Bud Light, this isn't your place.   When you walk downstairs and through the sliding door, it doesn't feel like you're in Charlotte anymore. You're transported into a speakeasy-Gatsby type world.   The bar program is outstanding. From the carefully crafted drinks (be patient when you order) to their impressive beer cellar (seriously, they have more than 500 options), Bar Manager/Mixologist Ron does such an amazing job. Two of my favorites are the Blackberry Mescal and Where There's Smoke. My last visit here, Ron made me a Smoked Buttered Pecan Old Fashioned. Not only was it delicious, the presentation was incredible (IG-worthy AF).   It's important here to trust your server and ask questions. The staff does a great job walking you through menus and offering recommendations. Food-wise I really love the fire roasted shishito peppers (I seriously could eat the entire bowl by myself), candied jalapeno bacon (guys, it's BACON in a brown sugar GLAZE), and ground duck flatbread (delicious flavor combo of house ground duck, sundried tomato, pear, mushroom, balsamic fig reduction). I honestly have never had a bad dish here. Note: some dishes make more sense for sharing than others.   The place is not huge, so they only do reservations until 9pm. Otherwise, it's first come, first serve. I'm a big fan of sitting at the bar. Parking, there is a paid lot on the other side of 7th. You also have the parking deck next to Rock Bottom (diagonally across Tryon). Try to look for a spot on the street, it's free after 6pm. Just make sure to pay attention to the metered spots and signage."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: this review only covers the drinks!  After a couple of failed attempts at getting a seat in this cozy cellar, I got a table with a few friends this past Saturday night for a round of drinks. The atmosphere is very dark and romantic, and we saw more than one couple getting up close and personal in the space.  The cocktail list is extensive and unique, and we were all able to find something to match our tastes, from mezcal to a smoky peach margarita. Be forewarned - the mojito is quite strong! I thought the cocktails were well crafted, but was also disappointed when my Tiki Punch came in a 2 oz shooter rather than being a full cocktail.  If cocktails aren't your thing, then I would just head upstairs for a beer at one of Duckworth's many, many taps. The food looked and smelled good, so I'll have to visit the cellar another time when I have an appetite!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorites to bring family and friends to, or just grab wine and dinner with old friends in Uptown Charlotte. Reservations are advised, naturally because I am not the only one who favors The Cellar. The atmosphere and ambiance is darker, modern, and gives off the perfect weekend vibe for a night out (however, I did have to sneak my phone out to read the vast cocktail list!). All of the dishes are hand crafted and served in really nice displays. Bar tenders and the wait staff are always friendly and they had great wine recommendations. I love going here on dates or with someone special as well because of the intimate feel."}
{"text":"This is how you go from 2 stars to 1, management sending out cowardly insults from a fake account.  I will never set foot in a Duckworths again, be it upstairs, downstairs, or another location.  Who's a dumbass now?"}
{"text":"Worth  It  so there's no getting around that this is a more expensive restaurant. Coming from D.C. I was expecting that level of prices but, still be prepared for the number at the end of the night. Justin and Dave where my bartenders and were great to chat with as I was dining alone. I got a custom cocktail based on what I like which was AMAZING! If you're adventurous you should ask for the bartender to surprise you. For food I got the preserved lemon risotto. Oh. My. God. Delicious. So much flavor. Even if I was with others I wouldn't want to share. I will be making this a stop on my next time through town!"}
{"text":"Great food, superb service.  I was on a special diet and they modified my food so it adhered to my dietary needs."}
{"text":"Outstanding in every way. Darren our server was polite professional and funny. There were three of us so we tried a bunch of things family style. The tomahawk ribeye is the steak I have ever had."}
{"text":"Very cool bar in downtown Charlotte. Unique atmosphere and a great spot to bring a few friends. Very different drink choices and somewhere where everyone can find something that they like."}
{"text":"The service is incredible!! Darren is hands down one of the best servers in the city! He was informative, friendly, funny, and made the best suggestions. The Cellar is super lucky to have such a great personality as the face of the fantastic food and cocktails! He made our experience here one to remember. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the ambiance. So cool and a speak-easy feel! The tuna tartar is bangin as was the risotto. Wasn't a fan of the s'mores dessert tho. Come with an expectation to drop some cash and if you don't have a reservation--on Saturday night we waited for 45 min on the waitlist to get first available which was at the bar."}
{"text":"The food is incredible.  We tried the tuna tartare, scallops, octopus fettucine, shrimp and grits, among a few others and everything was delicious and cooked very well."}
{"text":"While the food and cocktails were outstanding, the real reason you go to The Cellar at Duckworth's is for the ambience, which is truly extraordinary. My only gripe with the restaurant is that it doesn't have many vegan entrees readily available. The restaurant was able to accommodate with a few substitutions and exclusions, but it'd make The Cellar even better if it had more vegan options.   The Old Acquaintance cocktail is, to this date, the most unique and wonderful cocktail I've ever had."}
{"text":"Ah-Maz-Ing! By far one of my most favorite places in Charlotte.  The atmosphere is great and I loved sitting at the bar and chatting with the bar tender on all the different types of drinks he was making, he was truly an artist.  The only down fall was the night I went they seemed to be out of a lot of the different types of food I wanted to order.  But besides that, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"The vibe of this place is awesome, if I were local I'd come here often and would hang at the bar. Craft cocktails are on point. For those complaining about wait time, it's a CRAFT cocktail which means it has multiple ingredients and a process.   Our waiter Darren was absolutely fantastic. Probably one of the best waiters I've ever had and really made our experience memorable. He had great recommendations and was very down to earth.   The food out of a 5 point scale was a 4. We tried a bunch of small plates but weren't overly \"wow'd\" except for a few dishes. Incredible charcuterie, brussels, tuna tartare and truffle fries. Could so without the oysters (too much garlic) and the flatbread (too little meat and very little flavor).   The service was incredible and really made our experience. I'd be back to see Darren, grab some bites and a cocktail for sure."}
{"text":"Everything was really tasty.  Be warned though with larger groups food comes out at different times.  But we were warned.    Also a nice bourbon menu."}
{"text":"The meal was EXCELLENT. Server guided us through the menu and we ended up with a tapas menu that was absolutely delicious! We tried SEVEN of the NINE small plates and were impressed with each more than that last. If you are looking for delicious food, a unique environment and a memorable dining experience this is for you."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The beer selection is the most unique in town and the food was fabulous."}
{"text":"The drinks, food, and atmosphere were fantastic.  Really great addition, great place in uptown charlotte to go.  I highly recommend it.  The owners of Duckworths really know how to run a business."}
{"text":"My mister and I have a yearly tradition of grabbing a bite to eat off Tryon before Bachtoberfest at the Symphony, and this year the Cellar was our choice. I vacillated with giving either a 3-star or or 4-star review based on some highs and lows of our experience, but decided to round up because I definitely want to go back.   We managed to snag seats at the bar, which we were excited about watching the bartenders work their magic.There are certainly some inventive cocktails on the menu, but it was tough to share the iPad between two people when we both wanted to oogle the drink list. It would be helpful to maybe stick to a traditional paper menu for the cocktails since those are more limited in choice compared to the beer list.The bartenders were super friendly with us, but we definitely heard them kvetching about co-workers and other patrons. This was amusing for us to listen to, but probably not the most appropriate behavior on their part.    Everything on the food menu sounded great, so we had some tough choices to make. We settled on the shrimp and grits, truffle fries, scallops, and brussel sprouts.We enjoyed everything that we ordered, but, the pacing was a bit off. The fries came out like almost immediately, the scallops and shrimp and grits came out maybe 15 minutes later, but the brussel sprouts didn't arrive for maybe another 20 minutes after that. We honestly had debated about canceling them because it had taken so long in comparison to everything else that we had ordered."}
{"text":"Went to Cellar for drinks on Saturday night. Bartender Ron was friendly and his cocktails were all on point. Loved the expertly mixed old fashioned, boulevardier and the selection of whiskeys is excellent. I requested bourbon old fashioned instead of rye, and Ron steered me towards four roses. Flavor was perfect. Drinks are handcrafted right in front of you with high quality ingredients. Everything is fresh. Also tried the oyster appetizer which was great. Will definitely be back to get drinks and try the ribeye steak."}
{"text":"Awesome. Absolute must go to in Charlotte. The homemade cocktails and insane beer list had us from the start. All are on a convenient iPad with small descriptions to help you navigate the entirety. We had a nice variety of drinks, all of them were spot on. The food was amazing. Served as it is ready from the kitchen. Which makes the Cellar the ideal spot for sharing foods and spending time. Servers and food runners were spectacular and had great suggestions. Decor and speakeasy feel makes me love it more. Pricing is not insane for the quality of the experience. Love this place. We will definitely come here every time we are in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Man, I like this place. I would have given it all five stars if one of them wasn't good at math. Now, I'm not being a cynical math genius that all of us Asian naturally are. I mean we can like compete with computers, right?  Anyway, they had one of the best beers in the world. It's subjective, and my favorite is still Highland Gaelic Ale, but Mikkeller Monk's brew is seriously one of the best ever. Charlotte isn't all that international yet but having this Danish beer just makes me feel so connected!  And that's not all they have. They have the best charbroiled oysters, tuna tartar, and something that's like macaroni and cheese but really good. Oh, you know it's old school, and classy as heck, right? You'll like it. Trust me.  This place is full of folks grabbing a drink and small plates after work, as well as couples out on dates. It's good for both. I went with my wife the first time, and a bunch of guys the second time. Good for both occasions. Charlotte doesn't have many places like this. So let's take advantage of it."}
{"text":"Casual but intimate.  Great atmosphere and awesome food.  Darren our server was great !!!"}
{"text":"First night in Charlotte for a NYE celebration with my hubby and, after all the restaurant research I did, I was set on eating dinner here but had somehow misunderstood that they don't take reservations; turns out, for Fri/Sat dining, they recommend two week's notice. My disappointment was short lived, however, when they were able to identify a couple of spots at the bar (which is first come, first serve) within about 20 minutes.   It is worth mentioning that during that 20 minutes, we stepped upstairs to Duckworth's sports bar for a drink; that establishment's beer menu could not be more poorly laid out and the food menu looked average at best - a quick peruse of Yelp confirmed that. How this place and the Cellar are so aligned by proximity is unfortunate because they couldn't be more different.   I read other reviews re: the atmosphere of the Cellar to be a \"speak easy\" vibe and that is totally spot on. The dim lighting and exposed brick along with the sense that you are tucked away in the depths of a building feel a bit forbidden (AKA prohibition) and romantic.   Our place at the bar turned out to be ideal because of how fun and interesting it is to watch the skilled bartenders work; these are professionals who have mastered their craft and if you want an outstanding cocktail made to perfection, you've come to the right place. If cocktails aren't your thing, you can still expect them to be incredibly knowledgeable about the excellent wine and beer choices available.   Just one example - my hubby ordered a traditional whiskey sour that he declared \"tremendous\" and then asked for another cocktail BASED on a whiskey sour...essentially, the same but different. The bartender (Amanda - so great!) asked if it had to be bourbon or if she could experiment with a blended scotch - my husband was game and so glad for it as her \"invention\" was even better than the original.   For food, we couldn't leave without trying the truffle fries and they are everything you would hope for and expect - get them. My hubby did the waffle cone trio and while he enjoyed the contents of each very much, he determined the cones were not necessary nor did they add to the flavor profile...they were just a novel way to present the food. He also did the trio of tacos and said each was \"outstanding\" and he would absolutely order those again. For me, I had the lemon risotto with tomatoes,  asparagus, goat cheese, shaved Parmesan and almonds (for crunch and flavor) - - it was hands down the best risotto I've ever eaten and I'm still fantasizing about it as if it were a tawdry love affair! The creamy goodness of it was comforting but balanced with the refreshing zing of citrus all prepared to perfection.   I cannot say enough good things about this place; when in Charlotte, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am teetering between 3 and 4 stars on this one, but I will tell you why! Drinks? FANTASTIC!! Dave is a helpful, kind and efficient bartender and the drinks were phenomenal.  I ordered the \"where is the smoke\" and I have been dreaming of it since we left.  The cocktails are handcrafted and they satisfy everything you would desire from a \"mixologist! Food? Nah!  My husband and I ordered the Brussels sprouts (they were yummy and roasted, but the balsamic glaze was quite literally a raw balsamic vinegar on the plate), the cone trip ( not even a little worth it as they are all filled with fairly dried out meat and the cone is the dominant flavor- Dave did warn us!), and the Mac & Cheese ( now THIS was delicious! the truffle flavor was on point, the portion size was fulfilling and the cheese was super creamy and savory).  I would definitely return and try again, just would be super weary about spending a ton of money here knowing what I may not be satisfied with. PS- the atmosphere is perfect for a date night!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, and drinks. I was visiting Charlotte for business and was there for about a week. I literally could not stop thinking about this place, had to go a 2nd time in the same week!  When I walked in I was sure I went to the wrong place or wrong address. But the restaurant is downstairs. It feels significantly different down there being a speakeasy, think Prohibition era meets modern cigar lounge feel. I can see this place being a really nice date spot or great for catching up with friends.   The menu had many options But some of my favorites were the duck flatbread, tuna tartar and the scallops entrée. I was most impressed with the drink options. I had the smoked butter pecan old fashioned, it was amazing! I also had the bourbon barrel aged quadrupel ale from Three Philosophers and I was dreaming about it the next day, if you like dark beers with bourbon kick this is for you.  So onto the service. If the beer or food options mentioned above don't peak your interest I promise you that if you give your server any inkling that you're looking for some guidance they will be more than happy to help you. We actually had the opportunity to go into the Cellar and what I mean by that is their beer fridge that looks not unlike a humidor. Fun fact: that's where their name The Cellar comes from. It houses many beers they have on site.  It's not every time that you go to a restaurant and feel like you got the city experience. When in Charlotte visit The Cellar."}
{"text":"We stopped in right after 5 when they opened.  We had the Truffle Mac & Cheese, 3 Taco Plate & the Tuna Tartare between us two.  All were phenomenal, and the perfect amount of food to share & fill us up.  The cocktails are especially what will make me come back, and if you order, sit at the bar.  Half the enjoyment of the cocktail was watching Ron & John make them.  They light $hit on fire! The only thing I didn't like was the initial \"exclusivity\" that they are seeming to promote... one earlier Yelper hit it right on the head when she said \"the hostess who makes it seem like you're breaking in to a bank if you walk in without talking to her\".  Nobody was in the restaurant yet, & she huffed & puffed at others in front of us that walked past her to the empty bar.  Do a better job of greeting them when they walk down the stairs if you don't want them to walk past you."}
{"text":"This was the best place we ate while we were in Charlotte. There were no kids!! That was amazing....it's the little things!"}
{"text":"Great time, awesome food, fantastic decor. Had a amazing time with my co-workers. Loved the selections of beers."}
{"text":"What a neat place The Cellar is. As you descend down the steps in Duckworth's, you're transported from a deliberately raucous sports bar to a 1920s speakeasy with dim lights, exposed brick walls, and servers donning bow ties and suspenders. The staff greeted me with warm smiles and the service continued to exceed expectations with our waiter, Taylor (?), providing us with recommendations, educating our party about ingredients, and making sure our every need was met.  We ordered drinks first. My drink was a pear/peach (?) jalapeño number. It was small and underwhelming as it seemed they held back on the jalapeño. My friend ordered one with raisin vodka(?) because she likes raisins and while she thought the drink was fine, she was disappointed that she couldn't taste any raisin reference in the cocktail.   I was with a group of four and we shared Carmelized Brussels and Grilled oysters for our starters. The basalmic reduction drowned any carmelized flavor of the Brussels. What was good were the onions and prosciutto on the Brussels plate. I couldn't stop eating them.  The grilled oysters came out piping hot fresh off the grill. The starter came with 5 oysters, so you shouldn't order this if you plan on sharing OR just order two servings. The pecorino cheese, which is hard and has a salty element to it was a nice compliment. What I enjoyed most was dipping the bread in the oyster broth, in which was nestled a robust smokey flavor.  My main course, the shrimp and grits, while edible were a let down. The stone ground grits were acceptable, but lacked any cheddar flavor. The shrimp, individually, were well smoked. However, they missed the mark with the étouffée. There was too little of it, rendering the grits dry and was was there had a shallow taste at best and was disappointing. What makes shrimp and grits are the ingredients that collaborate with the shrimp and the grits. Here, they didn't work. After sampling my friend's scallops, I was terribly regretful that I didn't get those instead.  Post dinner, Charles - the manager, came out and greeted us personally, telling us about the concept development behind the  restaurant and a bit of a history lesson regarding prohibition and Charlotte. That was nice.  The price points here are reasonable, Shrimp & grits $15. Scallops $19. Drinks $10. See pictures for full menu.  Ambiance 5 stars, Service - 5 stars, Food 3 stars. Not taking averages because I'm here for the food. I'll give it another shot, but will be ordering either the scallops or trying a steak, as the waiter was enthusiastic about the state of the art broiler."}
{"text":"Pros: Amazing ambiance. It is in the basement of Duckworth's and is very darkly lit. Perfect for a special occasion or date night.  Service is some of the best I've ever had. If you take a sip of water they refill it almost immediately.  Great bar list. Handcrafted cocktails galore.  Food was great.   Cons: The menu is a bit small and would like to see some more choices. The plates are also small.   Takeaway: I would definitely go back! I would not recommend this place to kids. The dress is more business casual.   Would I go back? Yes!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start. The bartender was friendly, informative, knowledgeable and carried on great conversation. The drinks were incredible and this is coming from my wife and I who absolutely love cocktail bars and the mixology scene. They nailed the drinks at every step.  We tried the smoked whiskey sour and my wife tried a few drinks (names are slipping us at the moment) and everything was very well balanced and flavorful.   We also had the cheese and charcuterie board which was incredible to say the least.  If you're in town and enjoy a good upscale mixed drink you have to stop by."}
{"text":"Duck flatbread and Mac and Cheese were ridiculously good and the beer cellar was a cool way to try a huge variety of beers."}
{"text":"Culinary delights and a world class mixologist! A must visit dinner and drinks location! An excellent cheese spread: get the chocolate lab and wild boar! By far the best filet in Charlotte and chargrilled oysters to die for!  10 stars!!"}
{"text":"It's like you go into a different world when you go downstairs from the Duckworth Grill to the Cellar. They are very serious about their food down there. We had steak, mussels, oysters. Each dish was handcrafted with real attention to flavor. Great ambience. Excellent service. Only retarded thing was they checked I.D. when we bought drinks (and we are all pushing 60 and value common sense).  Overall, a great spot - Go eat there before the wait gets too long!"}
{"text":"Thank you so much for a great birthday party!!! The cocktails are fantastic.  The beer list is extensive and the food is superb!   The only thing better than the food is the service.   The mac n cheese is amazing. The fries are amazing.  The deserts are amazing"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! A very talented bartending staff with a unique drink menu. The food menu is also unique and delicious. Top of the list is the tuna tartare. Once you try this dish, you will crave it until you come back again!!"}
{"text":"Food is great. However, the service sucks. The bartender upstairs was super rude and short when we asked about the cellar down stairs. The hostess downstairs was also rude and was turning people away saying there was a 40+ wait when there were at least 4 open tables. I don't live here but if I did I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"The Cellar was an amazing place to eat. It's hidden, private and exclusive. The service was amazing. Every dish was explained and put together so nicely. Ben was a perfect waiter and had the best suggestions. The duck dish was exquisite as well as their Truffle Mac and Cheese. I had a handcrafted smoked whiskey sour and it was by far the best I have ever had. All their cocktails are mixed with all natural ingredients. I would highly recommend this place for a date night."}
{"text":"I have dined at the Cellar many times, and it has continuously left me somewhat underwhelmed. They have a cool space - low lighting, booth seating, swanky feel.   I recently did a girl's dinner here on a weeknight. When we arrived at 6 pm, we were some of the first guests of the evening.  We ordered apps and drinks. The apps came out quickly - I'd recommend the charcuterie board. The drinks took FOREVER to arrive - greater than 20 minutes. We ordered entrees and these also took a really long time to come out, which we found odd as the restaurant was empty. I ordered a burger and it was good, but not great.   I feel this place is on the expensive side for what you get. With their prices I'd expect great service and food, but both have not met my expectations on my visits here."}
{"text":"This is a really neat place. The wine/drink list is on an iPad so it gives a lot of detailed information. We arrived when the Cellar opened so it was pretty quiet down there but a game going on up stairs, which we could hear fans yelling. By the time we left, the restaurant noise was getting pretty loud. I recommend sitting at a high top at the bar because the tables are super close together. Overall, great place! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The burger is delicious... that's it.  Don't get the white Russian, it's really just ice with a shot of liquor. For appetizers, the cones are cute,  but not anything that impressive beyond the cleaver packaging they are presented in."}
{"text":"It's a cool atmosphere down there and the food is excellent. Not much seating for large groups, remember it. Slow service sometimes but no problem, food worth the wait. I love their craft cocktails also!"}
{"text":"My one and only gripe here is that they have some of the most uncomfortable bar stools in town. My ass goes numb after about an hour every time. Otherwise I'd start getting my mail sent here. Just something with a padded seat and small arm rest I can sink into after work would be perfect."}
{"text":"One of the best culinary experiences we have had in quite some time!  There were three of us that went for dinner and drinks. We started with a Cellar Smash, Asian Pear, and Old Fashioned. All of the drinks were phenomenal.   For food we all split the truffle fries, Brussels, tuna tartare, and truffle Mac. They were all so delicious that none of us could pick a favorite! The malt vinegar aioli with the fries, the balsamic reduction on the Brussels, and the smokiness of the Gouda in the mac were flavors that simply can't be beat.   No complaints here. Well worth the time and money."}
{"text":"This place is what Duckworth's should be.   Tip:  don't even visit the greeters, just go straight down the stairs. We made the mistake of hanging out upstairs before realizing we were in the wrong Duckworth's restaurant.   Ambience - darker, chill place that feels like a fancy pub. You come down into the cellar and make yourself home.   Service - was very good, much different than the service upstairs.   Apps. -  Brussel sprouts were good - a little less crisp bc of the maple glaze, but added a good flavor Mac/cheese - if you like Gouda, this is the Mac for you - it's pretty strong aftertaste.  Burger - Top 3 I've had anywhere. The Bacon is spicy, bun is soft, the meat (brisket/ground beef mix) was juicy wo being greasy, and the aoili is worth trying. But like a good steak, didn't want to add anything to it.   They have a Beer cellar, simulating a wine cellar. Nice touch.   I'd come back for sure. Great food, great feel, great staff. High five!"}
{"text":"They have a very impressive selection of beer and cider. Our waiter was great and provided good suggestions as well as giving us a tour of the beer cellar which was really awesome. We shared a lot of tapas that ranged from mediocre to delicious. My favorite was the risotto. The waffle cones were really unique but some were better than others."}
{"text":"Friday with zero reservations and the place was packed, no problem I'll grab a drink upstairs whilst waiting. I understand that Duckworth's upstairs is 'different' than the Cellar, but the service whilst waiting upstairs was awful. Literally had to flag down a waiter at the bar to get a drink menu, then again it was a struggle to get a waiter to bring the bill once the Cellar texted us. Kind of unacceptable when you have 5-6 staff members chatting at one end of the bar for almost 5 minutes, instead of checking in with customers. My friend physically had to wave them down, not cool.   Due to the lackadaisical service upstairs, it took us a few minutes to get downstairs and the hostess didn't seem pleased that we were 'tardy'. Not exactly how I want to start a dining experience in terms of negative body language and clear nonverbal cues she is perturbed. Lucky the bartender Dave was amazingly friendly and provided excellent service a welcome reprieve from the lackluster experience upstairs. The atmosphere as others has mentioned is cozy and perfect for a date night or work function. I wouldn't say it is a speak easy-esque establishment as others have stated, the vibe isn't intimate enough to describe it in that way. But it is definitely an upscale dining/drinking atmosphere which is a nice change of pace compared to many places in CLT.   Ordered the tuna tartare to start which was a tad bit on the salty side. The guacamole was teeming with too much salt, but the fish was fresh so overall it wasn't too bad. My friend ordered the Duck pasta dish which he seemed to enjoy, but I didn't particularly care of the heavy cream. My scallops were sweet and well cooked, but again the chorizo/corn mix was just way too salty.   After reading so many great reviews on Yelp for this place, I had high expectations for this establishment. Maybe we just got them on a bad night, but for the price point definitely expect food that is seasoned a bit more evenly and more welcoming service from the FOH."}
{"text":"Might want to make a reservation. We showed up and got bar seats by the skin of our teeth. The smoked whiskey sour was just divine. Probably one of the best cocktails I've ever had. Seeing them make it was such a treat. We only had the truffle fries, but they were excellent. You could definitely taste the truffle which is obviously what we wanted. The bartender was attentive and loved what he did. We wanna come back and try more!!!"}
{"text":"I have mixed emotions about this joint... Love the vibe! Love the bartenders, the drinks, the cellar itself and the bar in general.. I dislike the \"we don't do reservations\" (we do, but before 7pm)... And it's first come first serve, but there's a 45 minute wait...and today the bar seats are reserved because we're busy - I can't keep up. I can never just crave an evenings at the cellar and actually satisfy that craving. Not to mention the hostess who makes it seem like you're breaking in to a bank if you walk in without talking to her...   I understand the desire to maintain some sort of exclusivity, but at this rate.. I don't think I will go back. That makes me sad, but with the growing number of bars in the city, I'll get over it :)   If you are lucky and get there early enough and score a seat at the bar or even a table, it'll be a great experience; their food is good and drinks are great! I'd recommend you give it a try at least once because it is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I just landed a new job (thank you, thank you!) and the lady wanted to take me out for a nice celebratory dinner. I'll preface this review with a tl;dr at the beginning: It's gonna be hard for me to top this place as far as dining experiences go.  You walk down the staircase, and suddenly, everything changes from sports bar to swanky '20s speakeasy, complete with bowtie'd hosts and hostesses, jazz noir music (provided by their very own pandora station), dim lights, and mason jar lined tables with dark tones. This is legit, man. The only thing that The Cellar shares in common with upstairs? The owner and the use of Ipads for drinks. Even the general manager is separate.  The Drinks: The Cellar prides themselves on providing rare beers, and they sure do excel. In fact, I hadn't heard of a single one of them on their menu. They have a good variety of aged stouts, porters, belgians, farmhouse ales, even some wine type drinks. We didn't even delve into the cocktail menu. The staff is super knowledgeable about the beers as well, citing their flavor profiles and prominent flavors. FYI, since these are so rare, you're only gonna get 5 to 9 ounce pours on most. Sip and enjoy, this is NOT the place to be slamming nattys with the guys.  The food: Food is served tapas style with dishes coming right to your table when they're done cooking. I could honestly write paragraphs describing the handcrafted details and complexity and deliciousness of this food, but I'll keep it short:  3 Cheese/Meat Plate ($15) : We chose the Sopraseta, Aged Gouda, and a cheese I had never heard of called a Challerhocker (literally translates to 'sitting in the cellar'), all paired with different dips and preserves, as well as spent-grain bread from Birdsong. Amazing.  Tuna Tartare ($12) : Beautifully prepared with crispy noodles, an awesome guac, and crispy wontons to eat it all up with. Incredibly well seasoned and tasty.  Truffle Mac N Cheese ($12) : Both the Lady and I tasted it and said \"...wut.\" It's not food, it's just bliss. Heavy on the truffle, but little bits of prosciutto add the needed saltiness throughout the dish. Perfectly cooked and fantastically flavored.  Scallops ($19) : Jesus. How can they make food that good? Paired with a cauliflower puree and a salsa of roasted corn and currants for sweetness, this dish was out of this world!   Service:  Our server, Gabby, was absolutely delightful. She stayed with us to talk us through the intricacies of each dish, and was very attentive the entire night. Made us feel very welcome. Thanks, Gabby.  The manager came up and introduced himself to make sure everything was going alright. At the end of the night, I spotted the actual beer bottle cellar and he took the Lady and I in and explained their long term plans, interesting things about the building (it very well may have been a real speakeasy!), and talked to us about the chef. He took about 15 minutes out of his time there to show us around, it was really cool!  Overall, I can't recommend this place enough. Go and try it for yourself, I know we'll be back for the smores and cocktails which we were just too stuffed to fit in our stomachs!"}
{"text":"After a long and arduous trek to Charlotte involving multiple delayed flights and other crap, I was absolutely starving. Most of the restaurants I looked into closed at 10pm on Thursday, so I was kind of screwed until I magically stumbled upon this place.   It literally is in a basement, there is a sports bar upstairs, so it was kind of odd at first. This place has a very intimate charm to it, there is a speakeasy feel to it. There is a rather large bar along the side with low lighting and a bunch of high tops. Our waitress, Andrea, was absolutely wonderful. She was bubbly and pleasant, offering good suggestions on the menu and wine.   The wine list was actually on an iPad which I found cool since it allowed me to see the bottle of what I would be ordering. We ended up getting a bottle of French Bourgogne (Chardonnay essentially) and it was wonderful. Food wise we ordered some grouper, a tuna tartare and a truffle Mac and cheese to split between the two of us, and the food came out all as it was finished rather than as a table order. I was glad to see this as I was starving. More places seem to be doing this to avoid cold food.   Everything was completely and utterly decadent, and the atmosphere and service were top-notch. I wasn't expecting a place called \"the cellar\" to have such awesome food but this is really a well kept secret it seems (although the time we went was also odd). I'm not a local to Charlotte, but if I get back into town for whatever reason, I'll keep this place on my list. Very impressed."}
{"text":"First off. Fantastic atmosphere. Walking down into the restaurant, plus the low light, and how the staff is dressed up in old school attire, it's defintely a unique atmosphere. The beer list was fantastic, and everything was made to order. I pesonally had the smoked salmon flatbread for the small plate, and the saffron fettucine. They didn't have the Cellar Burger that night, which was sort of disappointing, but I was very happy with what I had. My dinner date had the grilled shrimp & ld kill cheddar grits. Her plate was great, even though the shrimp was a bit overcooked. Overall, I highly reccomend this spot for a date, or even a night out with the buds. Will defintely return."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! Would give them 6/5 if I could.   I am in Charlotte for work this week. My first time here. When you are alone, you don't want to end up in a wild dive bar. Thanks to Yelp I found the perfect place with the speakeasy vibe, jazzz (my favorite genre in music), bartender(Justin) who knows how to mix a good drink just based on my mood and the chef who is super creative with his food.   For cocktail my bartender made me something not in the menu. (something smoky with bourbon, honey and a kick of ginger). It was just perfect. For food I had the chat- grilled style oysters and tuna tartar. Both very delicious and highly recommend.   :):)"}
{"text":"I do not want to give this place a 5 star, because I don't want other people to figure out how awesome this place is and then I can never get a table.  This is our second time here, and I tried very hard to find something that I didn't care for.  It is rare I give a 5 star, but this place... this place... 5 stars!!    The bartender who served us was from New Jersey and surprisingly very friendly.  We chatted a bit about New York and New Jersey and some of the cool places we have experienced.  We live in New Jersey, so we had lost things to chat about.    She recommended a few items to which we decided they were great suggestions.  When the food arrived, we were floored again by the taste explosion on each of our plates.  The specialty drinks that the bartender made complemented our food very well.  So well, as a matter of fact, we had multiple craft cocktails.  I was amazed each time that as she mixed each beverage, she didn't need a recipe book or someone to remind her what went in each drink.  She was certainly on point!    Aside from the food and beverages, the restaurant is dark and cozy.  It simulates what prohibition days must have felt like when people would sneak around in secret places to enjoy alcoholic beverages.    Our first visit, we had a waiter who was very personable and shared some cool stories with us about his love for men's jewelry.  He said he made his own bracelet at a bead shop in Charlotte to mimic a David Yurman bracelet... and he did a fantastic job!!    Guys, I cannot tell you enough about how awesome this place is.  You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This was an impromptu ending to a wonderful ladies night. We spent most our time at the upstairs bar as the downstairs dining had a 45 min wait which I understand is typical for this spot. Our bartender was amazing and incredibly knowledgeable. We sampled dozens of IPA's. We enjoyed the bar so much that we nearly forgot we were waiting. Downstairs is very elegant with a speak easy vibe. Ambiance is very dark which typically turns me off but I found the environment very comfortable. Food was amazing! I had the taco trio. As our plates arrived we were given little lessons about the ingredients and preparation. After dinner we toured the cellar and learned even more. At no point did I feel I was just out to eat. From the moment we sat down, the night became a complete experience. I'm proud that such a spot exist in my city."}
{"text":"The Cellar definitely offers something that you don't find in Charlotte.  A restaurant/bar located down a flight of stairs of the uptown Duckworth's location.  As others have mentioned it is dark with a speak easy feel.  They offer craft cocktails, beer and wine with a full menu of appetizers, shared items, entrees and desserts.  The craft cocktails are all unique and allow anyone sitting at the bar to get a view of the skills of some of the mixologists, for example the burning of orange peels to give orange smoke flavor to one of their signature drinks.  I have been to The Cellar three times now and have enjoyed every visit.  The Manager is on point, walking the floor, checking in on customers and opening up about the story of The Cellar, the drinks, etc. As for the food, OMG. I can say the tuna tartare, one of the cold appetizers, is probably some of the best tartare I have ever had. And, the oysters, char grilled, were spot on. The first time I had them they were so hot, straight off the grill, with melted butter and bread served to sop of the butter and oyster juice...amazing.  This most recent visit I went to celebrate and early birthday dinner. We had 6:30 reservations and received a seat along the wall so we were able to enjoy a view of the bar and the entire restaurant, which ever table was booked/full by 7:30.  Make reservations if you can.  We ordered the tuna to start, amazing again, and decided to order the Tomahawk Steak (32 oz.) with Brussels Sprouts and their Truffle Mac and Cheese. The steak was unreal, a large rib eye on the bone, check out my picture.  The sprouts were chargrilled with a balsamic glaze, so good and the mac & cheese was good. Just a little too much truffle flavor for me, but good. Cocktails were great and although the service was a little hit or miss this night we enjoyed dinner very much.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There's not much I could say that hasn't already been said. Every bit of my experience here was excellent. Service was attentive, informative, and friendly. We got drinks and appetizers to split - Charcuterie board, lemon risotto, French Buck, and the Smoked Peach Margarita. All four of them were delicious."}
{"text":"Great service and great food!  Truffle fries were great.  I didn't think they were too salty like another review said.  Mac and cheese was very well done and we enjoyed it.  We ordered the tomahawk steak and shared it with the table.  Was perfectly cooked.  Beer list is great.  This place is a gem in Charlotte."}
{"text":"On our one night stay in Charlotte, we luckily chose to eat at The Cellar at Duckworth's. It was easily one of the best meals we have ever had! We had the mac and cheese, truffle frites, and the waffle cone plates for dinner and then the French toast for dessert. I'm pretty sure I will be dreaming about that French toast for the rest of my life! The cocktails were amazing (I highly recommend the Moscow mule- made with fresh ginger instead of ginger beer!) Thanks for the great experience- if we ever find ourselves in Charlotte again, we will be back!"}
{"text":"My friends were meeting up at The Cellar, and I am glad I was able to meet up with them. I didn't know about this spot (OK - I may need to resurface into the social world so I don't feel so out-of-the-loop). I like what they have done here - a nice intimate spot with good food and beverage options.   I was a little sticker shocked by the beer (over $10 for a 12 oz pour!) - and that they're served in a wine glass. BUT they do have more economical beer by the can options. I was happy with my NoDa Cavu ($5.50 seems to be a bargain by comparison).  I was impressed by the menu. I went with the Tacos Trio ($12) - they had me at pork belly and octopus! The braised chicken was my least favorite, but the pork belly & octopus tacos were both excellent.    Service was good - the waiter was attentive and showed a sense of humor and personality.   Thumbs up! Keep up the good work and I look forward for another visit."}
{"text":"Amazing! This restaurant stands out as one of my favorite experiences in Charlotte! I love the whole speakeasy feel. I felt like I was dining with Don Draper (it was my husband, even better!) Definitely get one of the signature cocktails and feel free to ask the waiter for suggestions. The smoked whiskey (might be remembering which liquor incorrectly?) was amazing. The tacos and waffle cones were good, definitely interesting, but my husband and I both loved the Mac and cheese and French fries. I could eat a whole serving of each on my own!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food.  Cocktails are all done perfectly.  I had a Sazerac which was amazing.  Brussel sprouts and scallops were incredible.  You feel like you are in the 20s listening to jazz and illegally drinking moonshine.  The walls are 3' of concrete from when it was a speakeasy to keep the music and noise from getting outside.  Be sure to check out the beer cellar.  They have everything you could imagine."}
{"text":"So I wanted to give 4.5 stars because I was highly disappointed in the char-grilled oysters. Nothing about them were good at all & if it wasn't for my friend eating them because she didn't want to take them back I would have, because they were a complete waste of $16 for 5 oysters at that. But I digress because other then that I had a wonderful evening here. The atmosphere here is very intimate and is perfect for a date night or even a nice ladies night. It's dimly lit and the music is low.  I started with the East Village as my drink of choice, if you're a bourbon drinker I would highly suggest it. For food we ordered the caramelized brussels that were cooked to perfection, the ground duck flatbread that was delicious, and the not too pleased with chargrilled oysters. The service was great, the bartender was friendly, offered suggestions, and was very attentive. I will definitely be back to get the Brussels again & to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"Sister restaurant to Duckworths, but can't accommodate children by allowing cheese pizza in from upstairs.  Wouldn't substitute Chedder for Gruyere on a burger even though they serve it on other dishes. Won't serve pork belly tacos unless you will also eat an octopus taco.  Bartender spent the whole time loudly crushing ice in the small room with a Mallot.  They are trying so hard to be something exclusive that they have missed the mark on customer service."}
{"text":"Wide selection of cocktails and beers. Good food selection. Can be a bit pricey, but worth it. Sometimes there's a wait for a table, but the bar is usually free. Quickly becoming a go-to spot when I want a good cocktail. Can't compare to Duckworth's because I never actually stay upstairs..."}
{"text":"$15 cup packed with ice served as a Moscow Mule.  Pass.   The flavor was fantastic. But literally 2 sips and gone.   Hard to be a return customer in that market."}
{"text":"5 stars for Sunday football. Tons of TVs and not over crowded in the bar area. Food was also pretty good. We got the fried chicken sandwich with roasted veggies, and the supreme philly cheese steak with \"exotic rice\". The service was also great for Sunday football - we didn't feel like we were being rushed out. I know I shouldn't take a star off for this but it really is still bothering me -- the reason this place doesn't get 5 stars from me is because the male bartender on Monday night was extremely rude and downright pretentious. Next time we'll sit back at a table for a better experience. Really upsetting but worth a visit back as long as we don't sit at the bar, he doesn't deserve our tips!"}
{"text":"I don't often leave reviews, but felt like I had to after last night. The Cellar is AWESOME! Great food and truly amazing and inspiring cocktails. The mixologist Ron was knowledgeable and fun. All his suggestions were great. The East Village may be the best, most complex whiskey cocktail I've ever had! Ron recommended the Tuna Tartare and it was simply amazing. If you're in or near Charlotte and don't try this place you're missing out. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The filet mignon, shishito peppers, tuna tartare and oysters were amazing. The beer was amazing. The beer cellar was even more amazing. Our server, Bobby, was phenomenal! He made the beer cellar tour so memorable by telling us stories about the prohibition-era use of the building. He made perfect recommendations for cocktails and beer but more impactfully, really showed a passion for sharing his love of the history with his clients.  To add an additional comment, we forgot to get our receipt last night and we are on a business trip. We came back this afternoon and even though they aren't open til 5, they have another restaurant upstairs. We asked if there was any way they could get us a receipt when they opened and they said they could take care of it, so we left our phone number. While we were sitting there, our server Bobby had showed up to get his phone that he forgot. When we told him our dilemma, he told us he saved the receipt and brought it to us. Bobby is one of the best parts about this place and my experience was so awesome that I came back again tonight."}
{"text":"LOVE this spot! This is my boyfriend and I's go-to spot for good wine and food. I love how the atmosphere is completely different from Duckworth's right upstairs. As you walk down the stairs you're greeted by a hostess who leads you through a sliding wooden door into a dark quaint room. There are plenty of booths and tables and also a small bar that offers delicious cocktails. They have an ipad that lists the wines and champagnes that are available. The servers are amazing and super helpful. We always get the truffle fries that are sprinkled with parsley, parmesan and come with an amazing side of a aioli vinegar sauce. It's so good we normally get two orders of it! The charcuterie board has plenty to choose from and pairs great with the wines they offer. If you go on Sundays they have half off wine bottles, it's such a great deal. Make sure to check out their burgers and order a cocktail. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Husband and I came here for New Year's Eve dinner. Cool vibe with prohibition theme, focusing mainly on a cellar full of delicious beer and whiskey, bourbon and gin (among others) cocktails. Tapas style service, however entree options are available. We got truffle fries, hummus, charcuterie plate and the Mediterranean flat bread. We finished all of the food and each got ~3 partial beer pours each. Service was fantastic, the wait staff worked as a great team and we were not left wanting for anything during this meal. Food was delicious and there were many more options on the menu that looked good. Overall wonderful experience and plan to return...who knows, maybe we'll be back this evening to ring in the new year with a cocktail!"}
{"text":"The Cellar was a cool place to go for drinks. The drinks were fantastic and unique. Other reviews said prepare to wait for drinks because they are handcrafted and could take time when the place is crowded. We decided to just go before the dinner rush, around 530. We did not have any wait longer than normal. The service was great and the food was good. It is a Tapas style spot and all the food was very unique. You can tell that the focus here is drinks as the food lacks in the flavor department but makes up in creativity."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed. Food marginal. Suppose the atmosphere is cool but tries too hard. Wouldn't spend time or money here."}
{"text":"What a great experience! After a delayed trip on Amtrak, I arrived in Charlotte at 9pm tired, thirsty, and needing food right then. The Cellar at Duckworth's sounded like a great place, but it was even better than I expected.   My partner and I shared a charcuterie plate, the tuna tartare, and a delicious chocolate torte for dessert--all were delicious and very filling. But, the best part of the evening was the beer. The cellar is a beer lover's dream come true--I've said this about a lot of places, but really! This is the one! As we looked over the ipad for a drink (10+ beers on tap in a small room, and even more in bottles) our bartender offered us a tour of their beer cellar, a 55 degree room cooled perfectly to meet the needs of 200+ bottles, many of them rare and vintage.  Charles, their \"beer collector\", was knowledgeable and excited about our questions, and helped us pick out several bottles that we hadn't tried before.   The cocktails looked fantastic, and I can't wait to go back and try more things (but only during the week...we tried going again on Saturday and the wait was 2 hours)."}
{"text":"When are you bringing back your Sunday half priced bottles?  And when will you change up the menu?  Come on now, don't get stale like your generic Duckworth locales!!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out. Great drink and the food is amazing. Love it. Definitely recommend to my frienda."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to the Cellar a couple of times and we still struggle with this place.  We both agree the food is really good (Waffle Cone, Tuna Tartare, Shrimp & Grits, Grouper (recently), Brussels Sprouts, Scallops and Filet Mignon but the order the food comes out of the kitchen is annoying.  I can understand the idea behind the Tapas (family style) but having the two main dishes come out 5 mins after each other and finally the side dish arriving 10 mins later is really not appealing.  The craft made drinks are good but overpriced but they do have a good selection of beers.   The other problem once you receive your first drink, you had better order the next one because it's going to be a long wait in-between.  Service has always been good since not the fault of the server in how the kitchen operates.  In addition, expect to spend 2 hours here because if you have a show to attend at the Blumenthal most likely you will be late getting there.  Noise level is really loud so not sure, how anyone could consider it romantic if you have to shout to be heard.    I saw in some of the reviews in Yelp the manager came over but in the 6 times this past year when we have gone never saw a manager or heard of one!"}
{"text":"The Cellar is worth every penny.  Don't get me wrong, dinner and drinks here will not come cheap.  But for what you get (food product, cocktail, service, portions, ambiance) it is well worth it.  Over the last few years I developed a seafood allergy.  The Cellar is one of those places where wifey can still enjoy grub de la mer, while I stick with all sorts of woodland creatures.  Everything we had was delicious, service was quicker than expected, cocktails were better than advertised, portions were larger than anticipated, and the check was smaller than planned.  You will want to plan ahead.  Book a table and get a reso or you'll be forced to wait or eat the bar. Don't come in a rush, enjoy yourself.  This is easily one of the best places to dine in Charlotte if you like to try a number of different dishes."}
{"text":"If you're around downtown Charlotte, I definitely recommend going to this place at least once. It has a classy speakeasy vibe, with awesome food and drinks. I got the Moscow mule with blackberries and it was delicious. For dinner, a friend and I got the fried oysters, hanger steak, and shrimp and grits - by far the best meal I've had on this trip."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and food.  Ribeye was perfectly cooked and a nice but not overwhelming size. Only quibble would be that the oysters were a bit overdone but overall excellent."}
{"text":"Traveling for business and went on a monday night.  It wasnt crowded so i was able to walk in.  Vibe is cool since its an old speakeasy. Food was excellent and service was top notch.  I had the duck pappardelle and brussel sprouts."}
{"text":"Oh boy was this such a great evening out! I had lamb delicious lamb!!! It was a lil dark but actually made for a nice change. It is called the cellar! Service the best and of course I enjoyed the cocktails! Each time I have co workers visiting Charlotte I tell them to go here. No one has been disappointed. The steak lovers love it. The cocktail folks are just as happy. You can't loose here."}
