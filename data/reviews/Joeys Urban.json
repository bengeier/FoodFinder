{"text":"Had the haddock and halibut fish and chips. It was very quick and fresh. The service was great as well. Will be back to try other menu items like the tacos and poutine. Was not busy and has a liquor license."}
{"text":"I ordered a Mexican poutine yesterday which includes sour cream, pulled beef, and pico de gallo. The poutine that I received only had a little but of pulled beef. Service was quick, probably because the food was well below average."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday.  I had the original fish taco with chips.  it was very tasty but very messy.  I have not tried many other fish tacos but now I want to eat them all.  go here and eat."}

{"text":"I get the strangest cravings out of no where... Today's craving was deep fried shrimp. Since I didn't know any other fast food places around the area that had such, I decided to come here.  I've been here numerous times before, but it has never been anything memorable. This visit was no different. The menu is easy to read, with lots of emphasis placed on their tacos. I've tried their urban poutines many times over, but have never found a true love for them. I have always found them to be overly dressed and messy. For today's order I got two pieces of fish and a shrimp \"kids meal\"; as I was not overly hungry.  The order was quickly made, I was able to quickly load up on condiments to go. They have a good selection of Franks' hot sauces that you can load up in to go containers as well. The two minute drive home was not bumpy at all, yet when I got home, I had found that the fish had already broken in half, and when I went to pick it up... the fish slipped right out of the batter. woot. It was easy enough to \"reassemble\" said fish though. For the first time in a long time... the fish hadn't come out tasting like old oil. I enjoyed it... enough.  I found the deep fried shrimp to be over battered and over done as well. I'm glad I only got a kids portion of it as I could only stomach a few pieces of it. The kids meal came with a side of fries; they actually survived the trip and weren't soggy at all.   Sadly enough, I trust that I'll keep coming back here when ever I'm wanting \"fish and chips\" as I'm too lazy to drive any where further..."}
