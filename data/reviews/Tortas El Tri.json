{"text":"Dropped in for lunch with skeptical feelings I get with new places I have not tried yet. Came out with plans to eat here when ever I have a craving for Mexican style food. Staff is great food is amazing, even kids loved it and they hate everything."}
{"text":"Meat Is mediocre, nothing home made about this place, Tortas are small and why put egg in a torta? The tortas are SMALL for 7 dollars average, if you know good mexican food this place is generic food nothing special, it was also dirty I did not like it at all,,, Sorry maybe am too picky but spending 30 dollars on 2 tortas drinks and tip, is not worth it."}
{"text":"Came here looking for a random place to eat. I kind of suck at Spanish (everything  is in Spanish)  so I didn't really know what the hell I was ordering but it worked!  I got the El tri and the asada to split and they were so good!  The El tri threw me off a little with the hot dogs ( I had no idea what was inside this sandwich)  but then I was like hey what the heck just try it and it was super delicious. The only complaint  was service was slow and I had to ask more than once for our drinks and it took forever to get an order in even though it wasn't busy,  however she was nice so I'll let it go and definitely come back."}
{"text":"Was craving a torta very badly and the only other place nearby I know that served them was Tortas Paquime, but was never really impressed with that place. So, I decided to give this place a try. El Tri definitely knows how to pack them! I ordered 2 Arizona's to go and a quesadilla with the words. Quesadilla was so large they had to put it in a pizza size box! Tortilla was handmade and warm. Pretty tasty! Tortas were huge, I only ate half of mine, but my husband was able to finish his entirely...although, he dropped into a food coma just seconds after polishing off the whole thing! Will definitely come back and try another one of their sure to be delicious tortas."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch during break and fell in love with the asada quesadilla (corn). Friendly service and affordable meals. Don't forget they're tortas, they are amazing too."}
{"text":"Came here about 6:30 and had horrible service. There wasn't a lot of people in there and only had 1 waitress. We got our food before we even got chips and salsa. The salsa tasted old. We also ordered 2 micheladas which never even got to the table. We asked 2 for them and she never brought them. The food was good, but not the service."}
{"text":"I've been going to lunch at Tortas el Tri for over a year and the food is always good. The prices are affordable and the service is top notch. I recommend Tortas El Tri to anyone looking to have good affordable Mexican food."}
{"text":"I tried to stop in here for lunch and was never greeted,  They didn't seem too busy with a light lunchtime crowd of three or four tables; but even after making eye contact with the young woman working the register the best I got was the feeling these folks would be happier if I just left.  So I did.  I walked around the corner to the Chipolte's in the same building where I had an adequate if uninspired meal.  The good news is there's plenty of parking in front of this place."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Was in AZ for a weekend and some family took us here. Definitely recommend the tinga huarache, which was bomba. I'll be getting the Asada quesadilla next time I go (which I hope is soon)."}
