{"text":"Where do I start.

Juan Gonzalez Taqueria is an affront to taco joints in the city. I haven't been to a Taco bell in about 20 years but I am fairly sure there would be more flavour in their horrid attempt at an Al Pastor taco than the pathetic plate that was served up to me at this place.

At 3.99 per taco you might think it would be a damn fine taco. My Al Pastor taco was a pathetic mess of 60% overcooked pork that was seasoned with something that added no flavour, 10% pineapple that wasn't very ripe, 20% diced onion, and 10% cilantro.

The ONLY redeeming feature was the bottled Horchata, which has a cinnamon stick inside the bottle to really bring out that flavour.

If you want decent tacos, consider a walk to Kensington Market or further east along Queen. Definitely not recommended."}
{"text":"Disappointing. No \"burrito bowl\" type option either. If you get one of their sodas to go, be sure to have your own bottle opener as they're not twist offs. I doubt it will be open after the summer ends."}
{"text":"avoid this place at at all cost!!! all cost i tell you!!!
even juan avoids this place!!

i'm going to keep it pretty simple, walked in with my gf waited 40 minutes after they messed up our order only to find out when we got home i bit in to my burrito it had a large piece of plastic in it!!

look just avoid this place not worth the headache.

don't be the unlucky juan eating from here!!!
plastic!! she rolled the burrito with plastic in it!!

I made this yelp account only to make this review, not a picky dude but this is ridiculous."}
{"text":"The eggplant taco was very good. The plating was very good too. Appreciated the complimentary nachos and salsa morita. Good selection of hot sauces on the table. However, the portion of breaded fish was sincerely pathetic (about the size of a chicken nugget). Good if you're vegetarian, need a paleta fix (Fresh fruit popsicle), want one of their extensive selection of Mexican sodas and cold coffee but otherwise it seems this is only if you're in immediate need of Mexican food and can't make your way to Julie's up Dovercourt or even venture Fonda Lola's dicey customer service down the street.

They should emphasize their veggie items. I think that will be the key to their successs."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon, as my husband needed a small snack.  He ordered a single taco, priced at $3.99 on the menu.  Was charged 13% tax, despite that the food was priced below the $4 threshold.  (Should not have been charged the provincial portion.)  When I asked the cashier, he tried to rationalize why this was the case and then said he was \"really bad with taxes\".

Taco was good, according to my husband.  Chips and salsa were also good; I sampled some.  Just annoyed by the fact that they are overcharging their customers."}
{"text":"It's okay.

Got the bean tacos, as it turned out they were out of the soy after I paid (always drives me crazy when places are out of stuff and don't post it anywhere). They were okay, although not much flavour and impossible to eat without making a watery mess.

The biggest thing for me is that the meal option was over $14 and you can get a lot more for a lot less in this hood. I get rent in Queen West is crazy, but I don't think tacos are wildly costly on ingredients.

Plus, the staff were on their phones while serving people, and that's just a bit douchey. 

Maybe the meat options are better? The bottled drinks are great (but you'll need a bottle opener), and chips are normal/tasty... I will say they were generous with the guac :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the burrito and it was very tasty. Super straightforward, street style burrito. Nice spice level and chips are included. More salsa options would be a big win.

They're new, so you have to forgive them a bit for the delay, but the order took longer than you'd expect. I'll see how hey fare next time back.

Overall, very welcome to have a burrito place in queen west. We've needed one!

All the potential to be 4 star, so I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My biggest pet peeve when it comes to burritos, especially those that are pressed down on a grill, is an interior that's both hot and cold. It's a jarring and completely avoidable scenario that thankfully has become fairly rare in this post-Burrito Boyz landscape.

Enter Juan Gonzalez Taqueria.

I arrived on a Tuesday at around lunchtime and the place was mostly empty. I decided to go with the carnitas burrito and asked for everything included and requested extra spice. (The latter provoked the cashier to tell me they don't include any hot sauce in their burritos but that I can add my own. A weird choice on their part but whatever, I guess.)

I received the burrito a few minutes later and was pleasantly surprised to discover it comes with a handful of nachos and an impressively spicy salsa verde for dipping. I took one bite of the burrito, though, and felt an instant case of buyer's remorse.

It's bad. As you may have guessed from my opening sentence, the meat-and-beans half of the burrito was hot and the other half, consisting of lettuce, tomatoes, mozzarella, and crema, was fresh-out-of-the-fridge cold. It was a completely distracting dichotomy that made me angrier and angrier as I kept eating. Of course, I could've forgiven this had the burrito been bursting with exotic flavors and spices, but nope, this dud was as bland as a piece of toast.

I mean, why bother opening a restaurant if this is the kind of phoned-in, flavor-free fare you're going to serve? I just don't understand it. And for the pleasure of eating this sad, pathetic burrito, I paid over $11.

At least the nachos were good."}
