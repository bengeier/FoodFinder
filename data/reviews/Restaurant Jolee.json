{"text":"The staff were friendly and the restaurant was clean, but unfortunately the food was not fresh.  The appetizers had been refried a couple times. You can tell because it was dry, dowy and lost most of its flavors.   The Lassi was more like a juice.  I ordered the butter chicken thali.  I received lamb instead which was not a big deal but I was really there for the butter chicken. They brought back something I have never seen before, a dark red paste butter chicken. Maybe they added extra seasoning to mask the fact that the chicken was just shavings off of a chicken drumstick. The skin was even on the chicken. It was dry and hard to chew because the chicken had been cooked long ago and left in the fridge. They probably ran out of the butter chicken to begin with and thought this would suffice. We will stick with Devs from now on."}
{"text":"Definitely the best food . Don't waste your time lining up at Thanjai restaurant . We quickly found this place and went here . If you like mutton you definitely have to try their mutton curry ."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute gem.  Great deal and authentic, delicious food."}
{"text":"Amazing south Indian/Sri Lankan food. I've been going here for 10+ years, and quality has been consistently good. Ambience is not much, but much more relaxed and spaced out than a typical hole in the wall. Place is equally busy with take-out and dine-in crowd, take out crowd is primarily local Sri Lankan, which speaks to the authenticity of the place.  Food is super cheap, and volume is so much that no one leaves hungry. For less than 10$ one could have a 3 course meal (app, main and tea). All the typical curries are on the menu, but go for Dosas( various kinds), ildli, kuttu roti( beware the heat factor, not for ones with fragile stomachs), string hoppers( crushed rice noodle lumps), poori masala( ask for substituting masala with Chana) and Medu wadas are to die for.  If you crave for heat in blistery Montreal winter, Jolee definitely makes the cut."}
{"text":"We got a lot more food than we were expecting based on the prices; be prepared for super sized portions for surprisingly few dollars!  That said, service was very friendly and quick (although I would have appreciated a heads up on the quantity of food that we unwittingly ordered instead of a good humored laugh when we asked for a to-go box).   The food was solidly good & appreciated that they have a variety of Indian desserts."}
{"text":"Best South Indian Restaurant I experienced in Montreal !! Jay took our order and he was very friendly and polite !! We enjoyed ordering with him !!  Curd Vada was the best   Uthappam was good as main course and chutney"}
{"text":"Looked and tasted like dog food. The lamb chunks in the curry were uneatable (square, processed chucks of nondescript meat you normally would buy for your dog or cat) as was the eggplant curry, which was way too salty and tasted like it came out of a jar or pre-made curry paste. I am baffled by the positive reviews here. I'm a huge fan of Indian food, but this was awful, just awful! The service was slow and inattentive too."}
{"text":"Joleen served typical Indian dosages with authentic taste. Twice I have been there and twice I was happy with my meal. I recommend the dosas and thali plates."}
{"text":"When we first moved to the neighborhood a few months ago, it took a minute to figure out our go-to spots. Especially late at night. Thankfully, Jolee is right around the corner, and when it's 9:30 at night, and there's nothing in the fridge and/or I'm too lazy too cook, we can count on this spot.   While it is a sit-down restaurant, we've mostly gotten our food to go, which seems to be what Jolee is popular for. The clientele, most of whom appear to be of the South Asian variety, are a clear indication that this place is legit.   We've mostly gotten three dishes: The daal, which is tasty but can be a little on the salty side, the veggie samosas, which with the dipping sauce are pretty amazing, and the star of the show, their chili chicken, which is spicy in that \"I'm sweating but I've gotta have more\" kinda way. I've also tried their tandoori chicken, which was good, but didn't quite stand out like the other dishes."}
{"text":"I got the worst food poisoning of my life from eating here, and that's saying a lot as I have backpacked through southeast Asia. Gut-wrenching, child-birth-like, almost went to the hospital, kind of food poisoning.   To be fair, had I not gotten food poisoning, I would have given this place 2 stars. The food was stale, and the bathrooms seemed as though they are cleaned once a month. The place is pretty cheap though, and they do give you big portions. Yet, I have had just as big portioned, cheap, and yummier Indian food elsewhere in cleaner establishments in Montreal that didn't make me feel like my insides were self-destructing. Proceed with caution!"}
{"text":"Excellent Sri Lankan Tamil and South Indian cuisine. Have a masala dosa or a vegetarian thali or some vegetarian string hoppers."}
{"text":"I discovered this restaurant when I was living in Montreal.  It serves South Indian and Sri Lankan food.  It remains my favourite restaurant ever.  I'm living in Ottawa now, but every time I visit Montreal, I have to go to Jolee.    The decor is nothing fancy, but the food is so delicious.  There is a take out counter at the back of the restaurant and people are constantly coming in for take out.      The Beef Rolls are amazing.  Spicy beef and potato, rolled up and then deep fried.  Yummy goodness!  The Fish Cutlets are good too (fish and potato).  My favourite dish is the Chicken Kottu Roti.  The portion is huge and has lots of chicken, egg, onions and roti pieces.  The Beef Biriyani is excellent too (lots of beef, cashews, and a boiled egg).  I find that the dishes here are spicy.  I like spicy, but I can only take a \"medium spicy\" here.  I usually just order mild, which has plenty of bite.    The prices are so awesome.  The huge Chicken Kottu Roti is like only $7 and can easily feed two people.  The Beef Rolls are less than $2 a piece (and they are bigger than usual egg rolls).      Their desserts are by the weight and very reasonable in cost.  I usually don't like Indian desserts because I find them too sweet, but I love the desserts at Jolee.  I usually order a box to go and get a piece of everything.  I have to admit that I don't know the names of any of the desserts or what is actually in them, but I know that they are colourful, pretty and delicious :)   Writing about this place is making me miss it so much.  If you haven't tried it yet, you should go, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Tasty food, well worth for the price. We were visiting Montreal 4 two days from Washington DC. Both nights eat here. No regrets."}
{"text":"Giant portions- very fairly priced.  Communication was the key issue- I asked for an extra plate to share the chicken biryani. Instead the guy brought an extra order. We were hungry; so we took it.   Someone ordered kothu and asked for extra gravy. An extra side of gravy was brought to the side waaay after the chap had already eaten the meal. He asked for extra gracy ON the meal.  Other than that; the food was pretty delicious!"}
{"text":"Nestled in between a bank and other commercial properties, there it is. Jolee restaurant, the one flouted by (too) many abstracted foodies. Please do not care for the broad-brush flare denomination that constitutes the essential decor. Yes, partial portion of the wall is missing paint. Yes, that dining table dates back from the 1980's, patched up with disparate parts. As it is only cosmetic, the oxymoron belongs as rightful attribute in the quality of their food. I ordered the lamb thalee (around 8$). The dish was plated with all the ostentation that it could, honestly simple. The protein had sufficient curry spices that enable me to distinctively taste the side dishes (pickled veggies, lentils and basmati rice). The naan bread is purposeful to clean off the plate. Because licking it would be harshfully objurgated.   Don't foget to tip."}
{"text":"The food here is stale and not very flavorful. I went for lunch and dinner and both times found the food to be unfresh. The dosas and the South Indian dishes like Idli are oily and bland in taste. Try Thanjai located a few blocks over instead for a dosa craving."}
{"text":"Well, this was a bit of a let down for me, shouldn't have read the reviews or listened to people I know tout the place. I did not read the menu attentively, consequently, I did not notice that none of the mains come with anything. This is, I find,is  rather annoying and does put the price up of \"cheap\" meal. Add enough and it's no longer all that cheap. I had the chicken in a thick, milky sauce, but had to order the bread, which was extra. One of my codiners ordered a lassie, and he said there was enough salt in it to de- ice our wonderful Montreal roads in winter. My other codiner was not very impressed with her hoppers. The one across from me ordered vegetarian, and never bothered  eat all of it, saying she didn't find it to be any good. Will give the place another shot sometime, will pay attention to the menu  next time, and see if it really is worth the hype."}
{"text":"Délicieux, frais, rapide. Ce petit resto cache est bien authentique et familial. Mangez leur kottu roti!!"}
{"text":"The decor is a bit old fashion but the food speaks for itself.The kottu roti is very filling, the the portions are huge and the customer service is on point.The butter chicken is even very good.Not a big fan of string hopper but I don't have experience with this dish ,so I can't rate it."}
{"text":"I went there with the family. Nice decent place. Lot of food for little money.  Got good service we were the only ppl in during lunch time. We ordered thali , naan & chicken 65. Thali was good. Chicken 65 was plain & bland. Was disappointing.  Might not go there again. I have had much better South Indian / Sri Lankan food in Montreal."}
{"text":"Ambiance: As basic as it gets. Two flat screens play Sri Lankan music videos.  Service: Attentive, friendly.   Price: $6 and up   Food: Best assortment of authentic Sri Lankan food in Montreal, including idlis, vadaas, string hoppers, pittu, and Indian standards such as thalis and curries. The dosas are to be highly recommended. The onion bhaji is fantastic. The portions are tremendous.  Summary: The food is as home cooked as it gets. It is not restaurant fare prepared for a western palate, but rather hearty food for the ex-pat Sri Lankan community. One of Montreal's hidden treasures."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place regularly like 7 years ago when I lived nearby. I went back recently and was a bit disappointed with the quality of the fold. I got a meat Thali tray and at least 2 of the various dishes you get were inedible. The legumes used were chewy like tree branch, and lackluster as far as taste goes. They still have affordable dishes, but after hearing about vermin and insect issues, I'll pass..."}
{"text":"I have been to Jolee on a few occasions and left satisfied each time. I am not that big into Sri Lankan cuisine so will not have any ideas on the authenticity of this place, but the food tastes great and leaves your apetite happy. I always order the regular lamb biryani from here. Its a bit spicy for my taste but the staff is more than happy to add extra sugar in my mango lassi which comes sweet and yummy anyway :)  Theres not much to comment on the ambiance as the area was nice and clean with tvs on both ends of the hall providing great tamil entertainment dances. Staff was courteous and knowledgebale if youre uncertain about a certain dish or need more info. Definitely recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Far away from Sri Lanka, this abode is a true life saver, the taste of home. I couldn't have had more of their cutlets, patties, and chinese rolls filled with stuffings, we call \"short eats\" back home. By the way thank you Canada for giving us a home."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre Sri Lankan food. Spicy without the spice. Everything just kind of tastes like watery mush. If you like mush though, then 5/5."}
{"text":"I had lunch there a few more times since my last review. Thali options are consistent in taste and competitively priced, though I would suggest avoiding the lamb option (chicken is much better). Quiet and large dining area. Take-out counter available. Quick and courteous service. My go-to place for Indian."}
{"text":"Excellents plats qu'on ne retrouve pas ailleurs. Je viens à ce resto depuis ses débuts et les recettes n'ont pas beaucoup changées et c'est tant mieux. Les plats sont faits avant tout pour les gens du coin, ça fait du bien de voir un peu d'authenticité!"}
{"text":"This place is an amazing bang for your buck. Tasty Sri Lankan food, $2 and under for many appetizers, most entrees (traditional, authentic Sri Lankan and south Indian fare) are under $7. It's not going to win any awards for decor or ambiance, but for quality on a budget, it cannot be beat.  We once catered a work party from this place; we were expecting about 40-50 people and we had a $300 budget. The fellow behind the counter took it as a challenge and gave us all a meal to remember, and even with everyone well-fed, we were taking home leftovers literally by the bucket load."}
{"text":"Tonight we went there. We ordered lentils soup, chicken tikka masala and chilli chicken with rice. The soup was nice, with lots of vegetables. The tikka masala actually wasn't my taste.  The chilli chicken was the best! Really hot!!! Specially I liked the souce and the vegetables under it.  We tried their special bread, it was tasty, too. I have to say, I've never tried any authentic Indian restaurant, I was afraid of a bit about the spicy meals, but I liked it. :) The guys were nice, helpful and we got our dishes quickly.  The place is recently renovated and it's clean, too. We can pay by card, but it has fee. I'm pretty sure we will go back in the future."}
