{"text":"We stopped by Billy Bobs a couple of times this past summer (2014). Everyone was so friendly. The food was great. Good enough that we came back on our way home to Indianapolis. We will be back anytime we venture west on I74 from Indy. The Regulators"}
{"text":"What has happened to this establishment??  It use to be so good.  I keep trying and they keep failing me!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is great. Bartenders are attentive and always very nice. The burgers are great. Tried the mushroom appetizer this time - very good. Beer is always ice cold. Defiantly recommend. Clean establishment. Bathrooms are clean. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you don't know where Ogden is, you aren't alone. Just go towards Danville from CU, it's the exit after St. Joe. Go into town, turn left at the road before the stop sign on 150. Go down until you are at the water tower, that is Billy Bob's.  I had been here once or twice before when there was a pool team here, back when I played on Tuesday nights. I had never eaten here before. I decided I should change that. We didn't know where to go to for dinner last Friday, so I suggested here (I wanted steak!) We started with appetizers. Kridz got the Mozzarella Sticks, I went with the Crab Stuffed Mushrooms. The mushrooms were awesome. Go there, get them. Seriously, that stuff was amazing. The waitress said it was house made stuffing, and it was great. Kridz really liked the sticks, they were battered, and not breaded. The breaded ones wind up looking like fish sticks, while battered is just so much better.  For main course, Kridz got the hot ham and cheese, with a side of the macaroni salad. She really REALLY like the macaroni salad. Sandwich was very buttery and good too. We inquired about the macaroni salad, if it was made in house, and the waitress said it wasn't.  I got the ribeye steak. It was prepared correctly. Was a really nice looking piece of meat. Good grill lines, good marbling, good flavor, and really tender. My side was the coleslaw. (also, I believe, made in house). It was a creamy coleslaw. Very creamy.  The wait staff was very friendly and treated us great.  It's only like 15 miles from CU, so it's a quick trip. The prices are very reasonable. The food was great. It's more of a NASCAR bar, as there was pickup truck racing on the TV instead of, you know, game 4 of the NBA basketball championship. I'm sure they would have changed to the game on one of the TV's were we to ask, but we didn't really want to impose.  They don't have an extensive beer list, but with demand, I'm sure that would change. The beers they had were very reasonably priced. Liquor was also inexpensive."}
