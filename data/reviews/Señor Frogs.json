{"text":"Pros : nice atmosphere   Cons: slow service, bad server attitude, bad food   I'm my opinion your better off heading to Carson and going to one of the many bars there that can provide quality food with quality service."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Top notch wings and cheap drinks! The atmosphere itself was on the verge of disgusting. We walked in and the place smelled damp and moldy. The bartender was great, but she was the only one there, serving more than 30 people. Slow service. It was a little scary with no bouncer upfront to help her out. The place was full and she was alone. The owner/manager should really reconsider that. If you have PLENTY of time to sit and drink and don't mind the look of the place, go for the food. Everything I tried was good, especially the cheesesteak and wings."}
{"text":"Ghetto crowd.. bad service try not to get mugged in their parking lot. Way to bring trash to dormont"}
{"text":"good cheap wings on certain nights but turns into hip hop ghetto weirdness at night/weekends.   this is one of those places where white females go to hook up with black males .  you get my drift ."}
{"text":"Inconsiderate patrons, I've witnessed them harassing people who live nearby. Have seen customers walk out with drinks no employees stop them then proceed to throw them in homeowner' yard's. Very surprised this place hasn't been shut down yet."}
{"text":"Cool place good music good vibes wish we could have tried the food but the kitchen closed at 11pm"}
{"text":"Their frog sauce and jalape√±o honey wings are my favorite in Pittsburgh, but go before 8pm as it gets really busy and sometimes a little shady"}
{"text":"The black and gold wings are my favorite.  They have good tacos too. They have one barmaid with a stink attitude so I dont deal with her (long dark strait hair...thin frame) the other lady is very nice. They need to do better with the bathroom otherwise the place is a good time."}
{"text":"Actually NO stars but....Sat here 15 minutes,  waitress \"checks\" in kitchen and says we can order. She takes our order  (8 of us), goes to kitchen and comes back at 12:03am and says the cook says NO....its after 12am and he ain't cooking. So we hungry. Where can i get some food. This place smokes stank anyways"}
{"text":"This place has awesome wings, plus they are super cheap. They have tons of sauces to choose from. Not the best atmosphere but if you are looking for a good wing night I'd try this place...almost every night is wing night there."}
{"text":"Service?  What service?  From the moment you enter this place you begin to wonder about your personal health and safety.  After hundreds of times driving by this place, some friends and I decided to stop in for the Tuesday wing night, and we left with the opinion that none of us would ever be making a return visit.  I'm not sick YET, but I guess we'll have to find out what the morning brings.  YOU CAN DO BETTER in this neighborhood, so don't expect much more than a crappy beer poured out of a questionable tap system into a partially-cleaned glass.  And if you're getting something to eat, say a few Hail Marys first.  (Actually, you'd be better off going half a mile down the street and getting a Fiori's pizza to go!)"}
{"text":"Best chicken in Pittsburgh.  Better than wings over Pittsburgh and ugly dog.  Great service!!!"}
{"text":"I heard this place had a wing special. I called to confirm that it was 5-10pm. Once I walked inside there was a good vibe. Only a few people but they seemed very nice. Meredith was the bartender. She is great at her job. She's very friendly and attentive, & really cute too.  After some minor keg issues I got a nice cold beer & ordered some wings. Their wing special requires orders of 10 wings. I tried 10 of the Diablo & 10 of the Voodoo. Both sauces had a lot of flavor. The Diablo is a hotter type of Buffalo, & the Voodoo is a hot BBQ sauce. Very good wings.  Overall it was an enjoyable experience. Everyone was cool & mellow, & the wings were good. I'll probably bring some friends & go back."}
