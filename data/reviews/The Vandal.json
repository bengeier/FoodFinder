{"text":"Amazing service and fabulous food! Everything was perfect. The place is cozy and welcoming. We loved!"}
{"text":"I just can't say enough good things about our dining experience at the Vandal. Attentive, courteous and informative servers. Creative, tasty starters (chilled nettle soup, pickled vegetables tempura, Austrian cheese spread with red cabbage and rye toast points), delicious entrees (salmon with rutabaga risotto and parsnip puree with a delicate lemon-fish sauce; fall-from-the-bone chicken paprikash with just the right amount of seasonings) and an unusual but incredibly satisfying dessert (rice pudding with sea salt, apple jam and hazelnut brittle) in a clean, no-frills, open kitchen space. Our party of four couldn't have felt more welcomed or pleased with dinner at the Vandal. Kudos to the restaurant for serving such fresh, well-prepared and thoughtful dishes and for having such a great, unpretentious staff and setting. Not only will I eat here again but also will I recommend to other originally-from-the-burgh friends. Such a treat!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that the food was excellent. I have to knock off two stars because of service. My husband and I tried this place for lunch over the summer and we both had the fried chicken sandwich, which came with the greens. It was delicious and would definitely go back and try the Vandal burger. However, I found mottled leaves in my salad covered with thorns including the stems. Photo is attached. Upon inspection the thorns seemed pretty rigid and sharp, so there's no doubt in my mind that biting and chewing on them would've caused injury and pain. We told the waitress and she looked instantly alarmed. She removed it from our table and walked away without apologizing. We thought she left to inform the manager/owner but she returned with the check with no mention/explanation of the mishap. I, otherwise, would've given them 5 stars if it wasn't for this incident but this really bothered me and now I have to thoroughly check the food before consuming anything from this restaurant, and so should other customers."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere, and service. The wife and I have been going here since it opened, and it just keeps getting better."}
{"text":"The bone marrow burger was all juicy/savory/umami goodness.  Perfect balance between a caramelized exterior, perfectly seasoned and savory patty, and some nice pickled ramps that were a great foil to the richness of the burger.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst restaurants I've ever had the displeasure of visiting. It seemed that the emphasis was on an artsy use of unique ingredients over taste. It is the only time that my party of five had to immediately go to the Iraqi restaurant next door to get another meal. The only exception was the lemonade we all enjoyed. Definitely not worth the money."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming back here; first time for brunch today.  I enjoy the limited but dynamic menu and different selections each visit.   This model to me adds value over routine establishments.   I tried the sausage dish today with tea cake and biscuits and jam.  Great flavors.  Space is limited here but cozy feel, can see kitchen and as noted great coffee here.  Like the freshly prepared food and actually like and respect there no substitution policy to get the genuine flavor and presentation of each crafted dish."}
{"text":"The star I gave is for the cute building, which was the only good thing about my experience.  We were given lukewarm water to start. The menu doesn't offer many choices so don't bring anyone who isn't ready to try different things. I had the salad, and for ten dollars thought it would be enough for a light lunch.  It was tiny and full of inedible greens.  I enjoy different lettuces, but these were greens that needed to be saut√©ed. They were rough and bitter.  There were about three green beans and one or two potatoes. The dressing was straight up vinegar. My mother had the polenta which contained one egg, a blossom of some sort and two sprigs of basil. For $13.  There was no bread, and once the plates were dropped off, no one came back to our table.  Because of the bitterness, I only ate the beans and potatoes out of my salad and my mother also only ate half, yet no one bothered to see if we liked our meal.  In fact, we had to flag down our waitress for the check only to be told to pay at the counter.  I would recommend many of the other places in Lawrenceville, which is what I wish I would have done."}
{"text":"Vandal is delicious! I've come here dozens of times since the restaurant's opening. The place has a very refreshing ambiance. My personal favorite is sitting by the window, where I get to a great view of Butler Street in Lawrenceville. I have not tried their coffee yet, but their lavender and rose tea are incredible. My only complaint is that the prices are a bit steep considering the portions."}
{"text":"This place is really overrated.  I rarely write reviews, but I felt so disappointed after going here that I was compelled to do so.  I got a eggplant wrap or sandwich or something for 10 or 11 bucks.  My wife and compatriots all got burgers.  

Burger patties were dry, small, 4th of July dad burgers.  In other words, not very flavorful.  And at 10 bucks or whatever, RIDICULOUSLY overpriced.  For another 5 bucks you could get a burger at Salt, which was literally the best burger you could ever put in your mouth.  But, alas, they are closed.  Even burgatory/brgr/tessoros have way better burgers than this place if you are into shelling out over 10 bucks for a burger.

The Eggplant wrap was the worst though.  It wasn't even a wrap!  It was a freaking piece of pita bread with a pool of hummus and like 10 chunks of eggplant that were so-so.  Total ripoff.

The fries were good.  The staff was really nice and attentive.  And the decor was, of course, kewl.

Hopefully the food catches up to the hype at some point."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 2 stars because I believe that the chefs here really do mean well. However, this kind of place just is not my thing. Your mileage may vary. I went with a lady friend to check this place out.

I laughed really hard when the one reviewer said that you need to go somewhere else after leaving the Vandal to actually get filled up, because its true! I mean, I can eat a snack at home. Is that their niche? Snack food? I don't know..

As others have mentioned, it is \"very hipster\" and I suppose is going for the \"less is more\" approach. To me, going out for a meal should be enjoyable and filling. This place really doesn't provide that, but instead makes these cute little dishes. The taste of the food was not horrible and wasn't something that I regretted, but I would not recommend this place like
I would many others who, for example, offer great food, a decent portion, good service and atmosphere.

I think this place could be an awesome spot. If they serve great coffee and breakfasts and maybe some sandwiches. They serve beer and coffee already, so they should take advantage of that and build from there. I like small town places like this and would love to support them more if they served quality stuff.

In addition, they could do awesome dinners for Valentine's Day and other holidays that would be awesome for couples due to the environment. Maybe sell tickets to those type of things? 

Overall, 2/5. It is a nice, intimate environment, the staff was cool, chefs seem to really care, but the offerings just aren't really my thing. They could do a lot more and be better."}
{"text":"We went for dinner and it was special!

We went after an event and ordered multiple small plates as our meal.  The meal was fantastic, the vibe was great, and the service excellent.  The only thing we didn't do was to B our own B which would have made it all the better.  We saw lots of small groups doing that, and if we lived anywhere within walking distance, this would be a favorite for ours.  Grab a bottle of wine and head over to the Vandal.

What we ate:  My partner is a pescatarian, so we really like it when there are great straight veggy options, and not just every form of short-rib imaginable, as others do.  The menu is great for that.

OK, I was going to look at their menu online to jog my memory of what we had, but that's not going to work because it was about 8 weeks ago, and the menu changes all the time.  The new menu looks every bit as fun as the one we ordered from, and if a changing menu is going to bother you then definitely feel free to steer clear.

However, on the current menu I see dishes that show the exact same approach to combining flavors and ingredients.  The Sardine/Gremolata dish was on when we were there and it was terrific.  The Potato Croquettes with goat cheese are a standard as well, and they were also worthy of a fork-fight for the last one.  We had a salmon dish, and the current one with celeriac risotto, while not identical sounds similar in concept, including the turnip puree and rutabaga. They also had a great crusty bread-dish that I don't see on the current menu.  But in place off that they have a buckwheat polenta/root vegetable/soft egg/ pepper jam dish that we MUST try.

Inventive, beautifully balanced, fresh, clean, great atmosphere, very thoughtful service.  We need to go back, and so do you.

I've picked up breakfast there and it's also great (as others have said here)."}
{"text":"The Vandal, one of the many restaurants that opened up in Pittsburgh this summer. I am happy that Pittsburgh's food scene is growing quickly. Each restaurant seems to have their own unique place, increasing the diversity of food choices. The Vandal provides interesting hamburgers and sandwiches. Overall, I thought the food was pretty good, but I wasn't completely blown away.

The service was fantastic. Everyone was sweet and helpful. I also enjoyed the atmosphere of the place.

We got the pork sandwich, chicken sandwich, fries, and hibiscus lemonade.

The pork sandwich was okay. The bread was a little chewy, but the flavors were great. The chicken was good. I liked the sweetness of the slaw, which complimented with the spiced chicken. The chicken itself was flavorful and crispy, although some parts of it were a little dry. Overall, the chicken sandwich was definitely the better of the two and the flavors were fantastic, I can see myself coming back for just that.

My only big issue with the place was the hibiscus lemonade. The ice in the drink had that weird savory flavor you get when you have ice in the freezer for too long. As the ice started to melt, it completely ruined our drink.

For the price, I thought it was pretty reasonable for the sandwiches. However, the side salads are pretty small for $5. While not the best chicken sandwich in Pittsburgh, it is a unique one and I see myself coming back sometimes."}
{"text":"We tried Vandal today for the first time. I had the chicken sandwich and hubby had the polenta and an apricot shrub. All the food was flavorful and filling. It did not blow me out of the water as far as creativity but it was good. I think the chicken sandwich could have been more juicy (maybe some dark meat?) and the slaw could have been more interesting to compliment the sweetness of the honey. But it was still a solid sandwich and I left feeling satisfied. The staff were berry welcoming and made me feel like a regular."}
{"text":"Food: very high quality dishes we ordered. Offerings rotate and lots of thought is put into them. 

Prices are high for the portion sizes, in the teens for entrees.

Atmosphere: excellent location on Butler in central Lawrenceville, went on a summer evening, would have liked to sit outside but there are only two small tables on the sidewalk, so sat in the cute window front thought it got slightly warm without being in path of air circulation. Really like the modern and minimal feel of the inside.

Can also come for coffee during the day."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Vandal for breakfast over the holidays. We both got the egg and bacon biscuit and the food was great - you can tell that it's all quality ingredients. The restaurant is also beautiful and full of light. I just got takeout this morning and it was a similar, great experience. The staff is also extremely hospitable. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I will be back! Now for review: 
First off-they don't serve coffee in real mugs - only to go cups. At that moment I knew I wasn't going to be overjoyed at breakfast here. Number two-I asked for a biscuit on the side and was told they wouldn't sell me one because they only had enough for the expected number of biscuit dishes they would sell that day. I should now mention I was the only person in the place. For the important part - the coffee is good. I had the soft scramble and the eggs were cooked PERFECTLY! They were a bit salty but the ricotta toned it down. The toast was made with brown bread which makes my heart happy. I believe the owner was out and about and couldn't have been nicer. So really the only downside is the ordering and coffee cups - but I think that is more indicative of the brunch culture in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Each dish was incredible with an interesting balance of tastes, textures and color combinations. 

We had a starter plate of garlic custard -- sounds strange but was wonderful -- more like the texture of a spread. 

We then shared the polenta dish, a burger and an order of pork sausage & potatoes with fiddle ferns. Each dish was a mouthful of sumptuous flavors. 

Finally, we got seated quickly and had attentive service. 

I'll be back as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to Lawrenceville! Amazing food. Great aesthetic! I had \"The Plate\" for breakfast which includes bacon, toast, eggs and greens. See photo for why those ordinary items are extraordinary at the Vandal. Also, I'm a coffee snob and their coffee is top notch. I might go back just for the beans! My entire experience was great. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We came to the restaurant exclusively for the burger, only to learn they were not serving it at dinner. The website lists the burger as an option for dinner, but it is a month out of date. We were served our beer in the bottles, they did not provide glasses. \"Prawn\" came with 4 pieces of shrimp, and over 20 peppers. We expected more shrimp, this dish should definitely be called \"Peppers\" When the main dishes came out, the NY Strip was cold. We had $10 corking fees which was not listed anywhere. Additionally,  there was no soap in the women's bathroom. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Delicious burger and fries with a nice, easygoing vibe. Service was awesome...took time to explain interesting menu options."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on a Saturday. I had the burger, which was tasty but not superb. The portion was good. Other dishes look good too, so I probably will come back to try something new next time."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday. The lemonade of the day was marigold, which tasted just like plain old lemonade to me. The beignets were not the best. Not close to New Orleans style beignets at all.  A bit too chewy and the blueberry sauce was bland. The fried chicken sandwich was pretty much all bread. I didn't even eat the bun because that's what most of the \"sandwich\" consisted of. The two pieces of chicken were decently seasoned, although I could barely taste the chili sauce that was promised per the menu. My partner ordered the deli plate which was insanely priced at $16 for deviled eggs, potato pancakes and braised cabbage! $45 later for two drinks, beignets and two entrees were a bit steep considering there are many other brunch locations to go to in this city where your money will take you further and you will be more satisfied."}
{"text":"The trout dish was delicious. I highly recommend it. Staff were very friendly and pleasant."}
{"text":"I had lunch at the Vandal in May and had a good experience. I wanted to try the breakfast menu on a Sunday morning. My son gave his name and number and was told 30-35 min. We walked around for 45min and I stopped by to ask how much longer. I was told we are next but at least 20 more min. After 2.5 hours I called to ask if it's still a reasonable wait time. The lady that answered gave the phone to a gentleman that said he tried to call and wanted to talk to my son because I sounded combative when I was talking to him. To my son he said he put his number in the garbage so he can't confirm the number he called, and gave him a number to call next time to make reservation. There are many good restaurants in the area with excellent customer service, no one needs to wait a whole morning for a meal reservation only to find out his number ended up in the garbage and being told they are combative when they ask why they were not called. Spend your money at a place that cares about customers."}
{"text":"Stop. Being. So. Amazing. 

Holy crap, the Vandal is the stuff. Honestly, if I could pick one restaurant to eat at for the rest of my life, it would be here. Extraordinary food, beautiful space, amazing staff. What I particularly love is how carefully everything is done here - the flavors just sing with freshness and nothing is overdone. LOVE."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food, service and experience are just as wonderful as Yelp is awful. Try the lemonade, fried chicken sandwich, lemonade and beets. Their lemonade is fabulous."}
{"text":"Came for Sunday brunch and enjoyed the food, atmosphere and service. The owner, Joey, was super nice and made it a point to stop by the table a bunch to see how everything was going and went above and beyond with the hospitality, by giving my family and I helpful tips on what to do in Pittsburgh during our stay. Maybe we are just jaded Brooklynites, but I would recommend, based on the welcoming feel and stellar service alone!"}
{"text":"After lusting over the impeccable interior design on Instagram for weeks (seriously, I want to move in), my boyfriend and I decided to stop by for brunch on a Saturday around noon. The entire time we were there, almost every table was full but due to fairly quick turnovers, there was never a wait for a table. 

We started with coffees and an order of beignets. The Vandal gets their coffee from nearby Constellation Coffee and I highly recommend it--so smooth and delicious! Our order of beignets came with two large beignets in a creamy pear sauce. Totally worth it!

I got the butternut squash toast for my entree, which is a spongy yet crisp bread from Five Points Bakery topped with butternut squash pur√©e, caramelized onions, and crispy kale. Light yet filling, I wish I could eat this everyday! My boyfriend went with the burger, which he didn't have any complaints about other than the lack of side dish. At $11, it seemed deserving of a small side with it. Adding a $3 side of fries would have pushed the price point a little too high for the casual vibe of the place. 

The staff was friendly and attentive throughout our meal. The Vandal definitely fills the void of a quick, high quality meal in Central Lawrenceville (other nearby restaurants that I consider comparable are not known for short waits and speed), however be prepared to pay for the quality. I'm looking forward to future visits!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I visited here on a recent Saturday for dinner and we both enjoyed our food and our experience.

Upon entry, we were greeted by a friendly employee (probably the owner) who enthusiastically told us about the menu.  We ordered a rose lemonade, a burger with fries, and a pork sandwich.  All of the food was cooked and seasoned well, and the prices were reasonable.

The inside of the restaurant was well kept, the decor and atmosphere was casual, and the music selection was distinctively retro.

We will definitely be returning to this neat Lawrenceville spot sometime soon for a relaxing dinner."}
{"text":"This is a Pittsburgh must-brunch spot. With brunch offerings like smoked trout on latkes, soft scrambled eggs with rye toast, quiche with peppers and leeks, beignets, and scones, there is something for everyone. Not to mention delicious teas and espresso drinks (rose latte???). Beware that there is no decaf espresso available though (no rose latte for me-- sad). Their turmeric ginger tea is a spicy and delicious caffeine-free alternative.

We ordered a few dishes: 

1) Soft scrambled eggs with ricotta. The eggs were so delicious and fluffy, and were perfectly complimented by the rye toast and side salad with lemony dressing.

2) Smoked trout with latkes, a pickled egg, carrot relish, and greens. All delicious and made for a unique dish. 

3) Apricot scone served with hazelnut butter and jam. Well baked and soft, although not very flavorful. The hazelnut butter and jam helped with that.

I really enjoyed my meal and the ambiance (modern, clean, and trendy), but gawked a bit at the prices. Brunch for two easily was $50 and we didn't even order alcohol!"}
{"text":"Finally made it down here for brunch, although admittedly I was hoping for lunch. Initial impressions were just what I expected but the restaurant was incredibly cold. No HVAC ductwork in the actual seating area, so not overly surprising with exposed bricks.

Wasn't overly crowded, but it still took about 25 minutes to get our meals.

My wife and I split some beignets with an orange curd sauce which I thought was very clever. For the price, I would've expected more than 2, but they were good.

My wife had the scrambled special and I had the AM burger. The burger didn't come with anything which was a shock to me as I'd seen plenty of photos posted on here with fries, so presumably that's only with lunch/dinner.

Both dishes were OK, we left hungry after a $40 meal which was disappointing. I'll definitely be back to try again, but this wasn't a great first impression for me. Entire waitstaff was pleasant."}
{"text":"Went there solely because they are rated for their best scrapple which they don't even offer.  Very limited brunch menu. Very dry tasteless scones. Not a winner.  Could barely cut thru crust of quiche. Please expand your menu and watch what you're rated for. Prices are good."}
{"text":"Hip done right. The Vandal could not be cooler. Coffee here is on point. Food is all about the basics being well constructed and elevated by thoughtful  presentation. I was here for brunch and the place was hopping. Great vibe, crowd and music. The design of the space is clean and modern. The Vandal is a solid choice for an excellent early day meal experience."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT INVENTIVE MENU AND REALLY ROMANTIC COZY SETTING!

Hello Loves!

I had the pleasure of attending a surprise birthday party here and then a date night dinner a few months later. Such a lovely little place in the heart of Lawrenceville! 

It is a vegetarian friendly place with very inventive recipes. I enjoyed sampling several small plates to get an idea of what the menu was like and was pleasantly surprised how sophisticated the food was. Homemade bread, homemade rice pudding, grilled ramps and pickled daikons stood out in my memory!

I HIGHLY recommend booking a table and trying new things!"}
{"text":"Today was my second time at Vandal and I had to finally get on here to rave about it. Me and my fianc√© stopped in for a late birthday lunch. It was the bday boys choice and he has been craving a burger after reading a review on the Vandal's burger. He said it was cooked perfectly and has not stopped talking about it since. He's a food snob so it's rare that he talks like this. I had the chicken sandwich and it was awesome.. reminded me of shake shack but better. Only complaint is the mixed greens with it were salted to hell. Still ate them though. Also had a cup of their coffee made by Parlor.. very good coffee. Will probably go back to grab a bag when we run out of coffee. Anyway, Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I would HIGHLY recommend this place to anybody looking for a welcoming atmosphere and wonderful food. I saw many people order the fried chicken sandwich, and the biscuit sandwich, both looked amazing. I had the Egg in the Hole, and my mother got the Smoked Trout. Both dishes were delicious and very filling. 

If you're a coffee lover, the Vandal has AMAZING coffee. It's strong, and the latte's have latte art on them as well. 

The restaurant itself is very aesthetically pleasing, and although it's small, everything is clean and white. The servers are very kind, and honestly this place is incredible."}
{"text":"Great food and super staff.  Really excited to get back here and explore more food options"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here this morning. I had the ham biscuit and my husband had the yogurt. Both were presenting amazingly and tasted soooo good. We cannot wait to come back to see what they have for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable. Look no further for brunch. Started with the ricotta toast. Off the charts. A perfect egg followed and the bacon is on the list of best ever.

I eat a lot of breakfast around the world and this place more than holds its own."}
{"text":"Vandal is a pretty good place. Came here for breakfast. They have a very unusual breakfast menu. But really good. I'm taking one star off for the chai latte which was very light and not hot at all. The food- we had the red potatoes mash (as it was the only vegetarian option). Pretty good! very spicy for american standards ! Nice place!"}
{"text":"Quickly becoming one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh to grab lunch or dinner.  The menu is small, but everything they make is really, really good.  This is one of the few places in town where I let my guard down when it comes to my tastes - and order things that I normally wouldn't eat.  So far, everything has been delicious.  My favorite item and the burger and the chicken sandwich.  

I also like that their menu has a few surprises once in a while.

Also: if you miss the fries from Station Street, I think these not only fix that craving, but may even be a little bit better.

The staff is also a bunch of nice folks!  Hope this place keeps thriving.

When they first opened, they used to have fried chicken for dinner.  I sure hope this makes a return someday.  Even if it's one day a week."}
{"text":"Great small resto, food is excellent.  May be a smaller menu than some are used too, but let me assure you, the flavors and from-scratch methods do not go unnoticed, along with the local sourcing of product.  I noticed because we are chefs in the industry.  If you are used to chain trailer restaurants like macaroni Grill, this is not the resto for you, they do not have 200 menu items, they have like 16, but all done to perfection.  Don't forget though, they are BYOB, which is not a bad thing, especially for those tight in the wallet.  Cheers and enjoy this place, owner Joey is doing a nice job and makes sure to greet almost every table."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time on a Saturday morning around 11AM. I should've known that the restaurant would be packed and that there would've been lines to wait in because I knew how popular of a place this was. We waited about 30-45 min to be seated. The inside is not too spacious so it was difficult to stand and wait (especially because it was kind of chilly the day we went so we didn't want to wait outside). But the great part was that they offered us drinks on the house for waiting so patiently. Their vanilla lattes is one of my favorites. 

We ordered the beignets to start off and they were pretty good. The sauce for it changes every so often so it would depend when you go to get them. I ordered the egg in the hole dish with tomato sauce and sides of crispy potatoes and greens. The bread was hard to cut so it made the dish a bit difficult to eat but it was a hearty meal overall. My friend got the soft scrambled egg with ricotta and rye toast. 

The interior is very clean and welcoming. The servers and staff were friendly also. The food is kind of on the pricey side but I think it's worth for the quality that they serve. I didn't know that the menu changes pretty frequently so I'd like to come back a couple more times to try out new dishes."}
{"text":"Picture this - Black Friday, a buddy and I have a bottle of the famed Bourbon County barleywine and a bottle of Dogfish 120 Minute.  Now add to this situation that it's 11AM and that most places have funky hours because apparently Black Friday is a national holiday now.  We NEED  a spot to rip into these beers AND eat some great food.  We stumbled into The Vandal after unsuccessful adventures to other establishments and were instantly greeted with menus and glasses for our sumptuous beers.  While we savored our first sips, we both selected the fried chicken sandwich (how can you not? my God it was big and just looks like it belongs in the Guggenheim) - I got a side of the mac and cheese and my friend got the (very large) side of fries.  The sandwiches come on a bed of greens and a small drizzle of dressing - everything was so fresh.  I didn't feel gross about eating a fried chicken sandwich and left with a happy stomach and empty beer bottles.  This is an amazing BYO place that is simple yet refined.  It does have a hipster vibe since it's set in the hipster capital of Pittsburgh, but that is NOT a bad thing.  I will definitely go back to try some of their other menu items because they have much more refined options that would be better served with a bottle of wine.  Well done, Vandals!"}
{"text":"I've been here 5 times or so twice for breakfast/brunch (sidenote: brunch is the most overrated of meals, as Bill Burr said, you're basically paying $50 for eggs), and thrice for dinner.  It's pretty great.  The food is inventive, even if it sounds like you're ordering an ordinary dish (good example: chicken and biscuits, which is more than what you'd get from Cracker Barrel).  The owner is probably the nicest restaurant owner I've met in Pgh. He really cares about his customers satisfaction.  All of the dishes are great that I've had.  Beignets are definitely worth going for, as a brunch item.  

I've debated whether or not to give it five stars (what a pompous a-hole I sound like, huh?), but dinner is just a little too overpriced for what you get.  A dinner entree is about the same price as most of Cure's entrees, but not quite filling.  I ordered the lamb last time and was still pretty hungry afterwards.  A similar Cure dish would leave me satisfied.  I've mentioned in other reviews that I am not all about massive quantities, but I don't think a person should leave empty stomached and empty walleted (and by making up words, I've now sounded pompous twice in a paragraph).  If I ever get laid off from my awesome and super important job, I want to come up with a quantitative/qualitative number which measures exactly what you get per dollar spent (such factors would include, quantity, quality, variety, uniqueness etc...).  For example, an average foot long at Subway would have a decent \"quantity per dollar\" rating, but would lack on \"quality per dollar\" and \"uniqueness per dollar\" ratings.  I think we could eventually come up with an overall new way to rate places, but in the end, food is pretty subjective typically (except you are an animal who needs to be put down if you think Kraft Mac n Cheese is a good meal).  But yeah, a place like Cure, while on the upper end of the price scale, would rate pretty high on this RQA (Restaurant quality assessment, welcome to pompous a-hole statement #3).  Vandal would rate pretty highly on everything, except their quantity per dollar spent is a little too low, which also affects the quality per dollar amount.  SHUT UP NERD, GET ON WITH IT...(I would love to hear any thoughts regarding this way to rate a place, and then 'forget' to give you credit when I license the terminology to Zagat's).  

Anyways, I apologize for the rambling.  But yeah, Vandal is very good, and a few months ago, I would've put it in my top 3 favorite places, but the dinner options are just a little too pricey for what you get, so I'll probably just go for lunch.  I do like that their menu is constantly changing, but that they are keeping the beignets.  Will be going back to  New Orleans soon, so I'll be doing some more beignet research.

IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND: Bruce Springsteen, in a post-2010 vacuum.  Worthy of praise, but high ticket prices may prevent him from acquiring new fans.  (This is probably my weakest musician metaphor yet, but not every restaurant parallels a music career.  Yet, I made this bed with my reviews, and now I must lie in it)"}
{"text":"Great service!! We had a thirty minute wait and they offered us drinks on the house for being so patient. The coffee here might even be better than the food. A little on the pricier side but believed that for the quality of food it was worth it. 

Ordered the beignets and was slightly disappointed because they just seemed like balls of fried dough without any flavor but the main dish I got (scrambled eggs) was hearty and delicious. Loved the clean, friendly environment. One of my favorite places in Pittsburgh. Will definitively be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Such a beautiful little restaurant! My mom and brother got the borscht and they had a fit over it! So delicious and complex. I had the European breakfast and my husband had the root vegetable tart... both fab. I also recommend the saffron latte!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars.
The food was pretty good, but the attitude knocked it down. 
-Can you order a stand-alone pastry vs. the whole $13 platter (and there was really no sides or anything for someone who didn't want a whole entree)? No.
-Can I get some morel mushrooms added as a side? Begrudgingly, yes, and $4 for like 4 tiny mushrooms
-I really don't mind the corkage fee for BYOB, but when I explicitly asked a server to confirm it was, in fact, BYOB, that would have been a courteous thing to mention.
Food was pretty good, but small portions and nothing I haven't seen a million times before out of the cliched hipster playbook."}
{"text":"So delighted this place is here! Easily one of my favorite places to grab a quick meal in Pittsburgh. Speaking only for vegetarian items, everything was delicious. The decor is perfect, in my opinion - light, minimal, airy, and modern - and the staff is friendly and acts as if you're a good friend they haven't seen in years. My one complaint is that it would be nice if there were a vegan option on the menu, or at least something that could be easily edited to be vegan."}
{"text":"Had a dinner meet-up with a group of friends that suddenly expanded from 7 to 11 attendees, and Vandal did a fabulous job accommodating us. And everyone was very satisfied with their dinners... incredibly savory concoctions of taste and flavors. Plus a couple vegetarian selections to accommodate us herbivores. I had a creamy pasta dish with mushrooms, and was so happy with the choice.
Also Vandal is BYOB...but there was a $3 per person corkage fee, which did seem excessive to me...but otherwise a very satisfying experience."}
{"text":"Fresh and local for sure the bacon was awesome and the egg was perfectly cooked. This place has great potential. My only gripe is price. I got iced coffee and a bacon egg biscuit and it cost 12 with tip. With that being said the whole biscuit sandwich was smaller than a baseball and it was $6. Haven't had lunch there but willing to try it!"}
{"text":"So everyone kept talking this place up. We popped in around halloween when they were doing to Bob's Burgers thing. It was a great idea, they all looked great, and the food was pretty good. However... it took about 45 minutes to get our to go order. They were understaffed and over packed.I was crushed into a corner waiting for our food. I wanted to go outside but there were 15 people on the sidewalk also waiting for food. While there I heard the staff say \"oh no we ran out of hamburger\" they placed a call to the butcher and ordered more. I don't think they were quite prepared for the turn out. After we left and ate our food, it was cold (not their fault but just a side note). I live very close to this location so I figured... why not give it another try. 

The space is small and cramped. The menu is small. The food is expensive. I don't need old country buffet sized portions of food, but I'd like to feel based on quality and quantity that my money was spent well. My food came. I ate in. It was... sub par. This is not the typeof place when I have out of town visitors that I would exclaim \"OH YOU HAVE TO TRY VANDAL\". It's that place that someone passes in the car with me and goes \"Have you ever eaten there? What's the food like? Is it cool?\" And I sigh and look out the window and say \"I wanted it to be. But it's not.\" 

This restaurant is like the hot guy/girl in high school that every one talks about how great they are and how fun they are and how interesting they are. One day at a party you end up sat next to them and you converse and you walk away from them and you go \"am I just not cool enough to get it? Theyre totally boring. They're a complete moron.\" and you feel sad a little as you slowly walk away knowing you'll never understand the appeal that everyone else seems to see. You can dress it up in the finest and hippest clothes, but it doesn't change the lack of substance."}
{"text":"My experience of brunch at The Vandal can best be described as rich comfort food served in a delicate and bright cafe. Decor and color scheme were bright and inviting with cute little fresh flowers at each table; reminded me of a cute coffee shop. The menu was small, but there were enough items for an indecisive individual like myself to spend extra time deciding on what to order. 

After some time spent deciding, we ultimately went with the beignets, biscuits and gravy, and polenta. Just from these three choices, you can tell they focus on comfort food right off the bat, right? I've never had beignets so I'm not entirely sure of what they're supposed to be like, but The Vandal's version seemed like they used a batter similar to funnel cake. The plate came with four balls of fried dough, set atop a strawberry yogurt-type sauce? I did like the sauce because it added an element of freshness that cut the greasiness and heaviness of the dough. The beignets are definitely a dish suited for sharing. The biscuits and gravy weren't the best we've had. The gravy was spiced quite heavily with what I thought was clove. Lastly, the polenta was delicious, but it was also incredibly rich and dense. Before I could get through half the plate, I just simply could not eat anymore. 

Overall, the brunch food was decent but I felt like the food was just too rich and comforting to enjoy in the month of June."}
{"text":"I came here for a mid-week brunch and thoroughly enjoyed it. The menu was quite selective, but I appreciate when restaurants have a small, thought-fully curated menu. I ordered the Biscuit Sandwich and my dad chose the Classic Plate. I loved the presentation. It was beautiful and simple. I, also, loved that they list where they get their locally sourced meats and poultry. The bacon was scrumptious, but I would say the bun was not to die for and that was slightly disappointing. I did, however, try the sourdough from the Classic Plate and that was amazing. I was still fairly hungry after I was done and ate a good amount of the bacon from the Classic Plate as it was a healthy proportion for my dad and I to split. The lattes were pretty bomb too. 

As far as the vibe goes, I loved it. Loved the exposed brick, loved the marble tables, loved the cleanliness of it and the natural lighting. The music wasn't exactly my father's preference, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The staff were super warm and pleasant. The only bone I would pick is that they seem to have a set way of seating people and I'm not sure if it was just a rare occasion but we were seated in the back left corner close to the kitchen and I think I would have preferred any other table. It was fairly empty, but someone else came in and they were seated right next to us in this empty place and it totally killed the ambiance and was a distraction, mostly because there was a squirmy child. They also will not let you pay at your table, must pay at the counter. 

Overall, it's a very Lawrenceville, \"hipster\" place and my 20/30 something friends would eat it up. There's also street parking all along Butler Street, but we parked at a little parking lot literally right next to it which was so much less stressful than finding a place to parallel park."}
{"text":"We love the vandal and I chose it for my birthday today but it was a bit of a letdown.  The chicken sandwich is a classic that no one does better, but the squash soup, while tasty, was unpredictably thin and made up almost entirely of cream.  

The fried pickles were inedible.  My resident vinegar lover, who will sprinkle vinegar on things happily, actually gagged at the table.  The pickles are radishes and carrots which I assume are meant to be a pleasant surprise but it was an unwelcome one in our case,especially since they were so hard to bite through it hurt a little.

The server didn't seem to notice that they remained 90% uneaten and didn't ask how the meal was so I let it go.  (He stopped in to check on us right when he delivered them but we hadn't tasted them yet at that point.)

So Vandal, keep up the generally great work but please annex the pickles or serve with a warning."}
{"text":"The girl at the register could not have made three people getting coffee feel more unwelcome. It was as though it was her job to make people feel like they should leave. This is a bummer because I have been wanting to go so badly and get very out of place once I finally stopped in. Also, no decaf anything. Oh well."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Went with my girlfriend for dinner and had no regrets. Fast turnover when ordering and really friendly staff."}
{"text":"Breakfast: very good, could've been seasoned more, but hey, I can S&P my own meal. 

Atmosphere is hip and clean, but a little to Psych Ward for me...personal issue.

Looking forward to a dinner encounter and more therapy."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dessert last night! The space was packed, but we were seated right away. The bartender/host/server (he literally did it all!) accommodated our every need. He suggested the blood orange marmalade cake and we each had a warm beverage. It was the perfect place to eat and chat. We did not feel rushed or pressured at all. 

I hope to be back in the coming weeks for dinner or brunch!"}
{"text":"The Vandal menu is so simple yet the food is very complex. Tons of flavors going on with the Pork Sandwich on wonderful rye bread. The Chicken Sandwich is hearty, slaw-y, and yummy, but you'll need your napkin. Today I had the Burger, which was tastes and filling, but those fries man. Super hot and fresh, with just a dash of salt, oh so crispy. Heinz ketchup of course. Get to The Vandal, ya filthy vanimals!"}
{"text":"Brunch. 

Get: Fried chicken sandwich with a fried egg. 
The brioche bun is toasted and very good quality - soft and buttery. (I feel lk buns can either make it or break it for burgers/sandwiches. Good meat but dry/stale as hell untoasted buns = automatic \"this burger sucks.\")

Star player fried chicken was  Juicy and plumpy inside, crispy skin outside with bit of maple syrup or honey drizzled - made a perfect savory/sweet combo! 
The egg is also cooked to perfection with bit of runniness when you pop the yolk. 

The potato hash also has very hearty flavor profile, with potatoes crisp-ed on their sides. Better with an egg. I would opt for potato hash if I wasn't feeling greasy food but was hung over. 

Other things: bring a bottle of sparkling wine and make yo own mimosas. I feel lk that should be a rule to every byob brunch spots. And pay at the counter. They won't bring the check to you even you glare at them. 

The only downfall was staff being little inflexible with sitting arrangement but I assume they have some protocol? Idk there was an obvious simple logical solution to a sitting arrangement yet they just ignored it. Then they ended up doing what we suggested about 30 mins after."}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday brunch. The place was not completely full, but part of our party got there early and the other part was late (thanks to a slacker uber driver, not their fault). We told the waitress what was going on, and she was totally chill about it. She served us our drinks and let us wait for the rest of the people to show up. Great service, even though we were a little disorganized.

The food was really good. I had a chicken breakfast sandwich that was sweet and spicy, but I wish I would have gotten it on a biscuit instead of bread. I also wish that the chicken wasn't as thick, because some parts in the middle were a little bland. 

Overall good food, good drinks, and good staff."}
{"text":"The vandal is my favorite restaurant in Lawrenceville. Whether it's brunch or dinner, it's always amazing. Classical cooking techniques presented in a modern way. Go here but byob!"}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch - the food is very good, and there is a great vibe here. Definitely worth checking out. I had beets (great!) and the quiche with peas and a side of greens (awesome!) I see myself back here again in the near future."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch today. So so soooo good. 
I had the biscuit with ham and egg. 
This place is BYOB so I also had some pink champagne on the side. 
My sandwich was SO good. The service was quick and the place is really clean. 
It is very small but we came at 10:30am and had no problem getting a table. 
Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Cool establishment. Small menu with local ingredients that change frequently. The pastry board is great. Service could be a little more attentive- we asked for coffee refills and they never came. Otherwise very friendly. Get there early for brunch & try to get a window seat, our favorite."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come in here for a while. Finally got the chance tonight.  I wasn't disappointed. I got the pork sandwich and it was very good.  I was skeptical at first based on the ingredients, but they all worked very well together.  My only complaint was that the toasted bread it came on was a little greasy.  But that mDe it taste better. I will be back to try other things!"}
{"text":"With out a doubt, The Vandal is the crown jewel of Lawrenceville. I experience impeccable service every time and the food is perfect, no matter what I order. I always try to take friends who haven't been before and out of town friends to this restaurant. They have all been delighted."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for brunch in Pittsburgh.  Thats thanks to my wonderful Aunt Sue.  She sent me an article out of travel and leisure magazine that highlighted this restaurant and some others in East liberty and Lawrenceville area. If I hadn't read that article I probably would never have tried this place. The menu is small, but that doesn't mean small on taste. Everything they make is sheer perfection. My favorites are the ricotta scrambled eggs with a side green salad and the chicken sandwich with carrot slaw.  In addition to the great food they have a delicious coffee bar with wonderful cold brews, lattes,  and freshly squeezed juice.  This is definitely a bit on the expensive and for breakfast entr√©es usually range between 10 and $15, but it's totally worth it. All of my out-of-town gas I have been taking here or to my two other favorite places for brunch in town.  Everyone that I take care of just loves it!  Just to know it's small and there are not a lot of tables and they don't take reservations for breakfast."}
{"text":"Love this place for brunch on Sunday. I usually order the soft scrambled eggs (with ricotta). The atmosphere is fresh but small enough that it is never too noisy to catch up with your dining companion. The menu is small but each item is done well and the service is attentive but not overbearing. This is a great restaurant to enjoy with a friend for brunch. The food goes well beyond the traditional brunch or diner experience. The surrounding area is great to walk around if you are waiting for a table or have time after your brunch."}
{"text":"Expectations were high, maybe it could be because it was a Saturday brunch but my schnitzel was one of the worse I've ever had, and that's a difficult tasks.  The schnitzel was over cooked, that is fried, the oil must have been old, and part the crust was missing! It looked more like the fried chicken sandwich that someone on the next table ordered. It was way too thick for a schnitzel. Sorry guys, something went wrong."}
{"text":"Meh. I had the chicken sandwich ($10 with no side)  and beet salad ($4 for 2.5 beets). For the money, I was unimpressed. The fried chicken was dry, cut into four little pieces that kept falling off the bun. It had this sticky honey sauce that ended up all over my hands, and the slaw was just mostly raw carrots. The beets were good, just felt like a small portion. The space was really great, and it's BYOB. Probably won't be back though."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. Delicious food. My husband and I tried the burger and the eggplant. We got our food within 10 minutes.Both were tasty and cooked as we requested. I like that the portion sizes are not huge so you leave feeling satisfied and not stuffed. 

I hope that they continue to expand their menu, especially their coffee options, because this would be a great place to spend time reading a book or doing some work. The decor is clean, simple, tranquil and the seats are comfortable. It is somewhere I might like to linger for a while."}
{"text":"On a chilly Thursday morning after a night shift, I found myself in Lawrenceville wanting to treat myself to a nice breakfast (or would that be dinner?). In any case, I had heard the good vibes coming from the Vandal, so I traipsed down to Butler from Penn to check it out for myself. With only one other patron who eventually came in during my meal, it was a quiet yet very much welcoming atmosphere that I encountered, mostly due to the friendly staff who greeted immediately upon entering. After hearing about the breakfast menu options, I selected one of the toasts and a vanilla lemonade to accompany it. I was quickly served a thick slice of perfectly toasted bread (think chewy-to-the-point-of-cloud texture in the middle with a perfect char on the outside, with just a hint of smoky campfire flavor here and there) slathered with the lightest, creamiest ricotta I've ever tasted. On top of that came several generous pats of apple jam and a few thinly sliced pieces of an Italian cured meat (whose name is unfortunately escaping me).

Sometimes I find that I enjoy food most when the contrasts between flavors play themselves out on the plate, but not so at the Vandal. The individual components of my toast melded so beautifully that the sum of the parts was far greater than any contrast each individual ingredient might have provided. (But, okay, real talk--I knew I was a goner when I found myself wanting to lick my plate... only two bites into my toast.) The toast itself was generously cut, so I found myself perfectly satisfied at the end of my meal. And then to wash it down with that lovely vanilla lemonade... I don't care if it's 15 degrees and snowing or more lemonade-drinking appropo weather, all lemonade in all seasons should be so sweetly accented with vanilla. Who knew?

At the end of the meal, one of the staff members reminded me that the Vandal also serves lunch and dinner. If my breakfast was any indication, I am sure I'll be back soon for more delicious adventures at the Vandal."}
{"text":"Hands down best espresso based drinks in the world. Best straight espresso in the world. Joey is the man. Food is out of control. Love this place. and no, I don't know the owners or chefs. Wonderful place."}
{"text":"I love coming here for brunch. The coffee is really great. And their food is amazing and they change their menu all the time. I like the ambience of this location and it is really cutely decorated inside"}
{"text":"Quaint, polished and lovely but food was just ok.

Walk in and you can seat yourself. The drink menu is on the right wall and it seems as if that counter also works as a coffee bar (interesting hybrid). 

As a veggie, there were a lot of starters that looked very good and meatless. However I only ordered a main- the polenta dish with duck egg. I was pleasantly surprised by the giant dish of creamy smooth polenta that came out, I enjoyed it with the cabbage, radishes, and duck egg that adorned it. Serving size was massive and odd. Duck egg was luke warm in contrast to the hot polenta- not ideal.

My husband said his burger was just ok. Fries were heavily salted but very tasty (I love salt). I saw a starter portion of fries come out at the volume is generous!

A lovely evening if you want to try something new. Interested in trying different dishes there but not in a hurry to come back. A+ for effort tho, everyone was trying hard to please there."}
{"text":"Loved the location, on Butler Street in Lawrenceville.  The menu is small but that usually means better food as the focus is in a few quality items.  Waiter was very attentive,
Made good recommendations and proved to be very friendly.  My Star rating is because the servings are really good as art, if you would.  While presentation was beautiful, portions were very small.  We paid a corking fee for the wine we brought.  My guest asked for the details behind the corking fee.  It was explained that people who bring wine linger longer and that the fee covers the extra table time.  We ordered, we ate and almost immediately following we were presented with the bill and pretty much coaxed to pay immediately so they could turn the table.  So much for the corking fee covering a customer who might want to linger......"}
{"text":"There's \"toast,\" and then there's TOAST.  Vandal's \"Toasts\" fall into the latter category. I arrived at The Vandal one sunny Sunday Lville morning with a crew of 6. We were seated right away and ordered from the counter after perusing the [small] menu. I chose the Huckleberry Toast while Aimee D. chose the Squash Toast so we could share.  Among the groups' other choices were the Morning Burger, a Bacon Plate and Celery Soup.  We all left pleased, but maybe just a tad bit hungry. The Toasts are INCREDIBLE, but at the end of the day, it's one [big] piece of toast. So, if you're looking for more, I'd recommend adding the yogurt/granola for some delicious protein. We were each given a sample of this concoction and DAMN, was it good.  But back to the toasts - the ingredients on top were clearly top notch. At $6, each Toast isn't going to break the bank, but $12 for two, which I definitely could've housed, is a bit too much for me for...toast. Something to think about. I recommend going with a bunch of friends and completely \"vandalizing\" the menu - meaning, order one of everything and have at it. Welcome to Lawrenceville, Vandal!"}
{"text":"Overpriced. The food is good, but not good enough to justify a $16 and $13 price tags for very small portions. Minimalistic plates may look nice on instagram but they are neither creative nor big enough to cost more than ten bucks. Especially with the name like this, come on, put more food on the plates. 

Water is warm tap and doesn't taste good. No air conditioning. 

Good coffee."}
{"text":"Absolutely.  Do this.  Go there.  Make it happen. There need to be more places like it.  I can still taste the carrots.... (drool)

I was home for the holidays and my family has been dying to try the Vandal for months.  I made them wait for me (thank god).

Where to even begin?  The restaurant is in the heart of Lawrenceville.  Immediately when you walk in you get a very calm peaceful vibe.  This is not a fast food place, although you can get great food fast.  This is the kind of place where people come to savor incredible food and have conversation.  It's the kind of place you want to spend time in.

The menu is small - which I actually prefer.  They do a select list of items, sourced locally, and they do them with absolute finesse. There are approximately five sandwich options (as it stands today) - offering everything from Pork, Burger, Carrot, Confit to Catfish.  There were also \"snacks\" in the form of soup, salad, farro and beats.  

The catfish was unfortunately sold out on the evening that we went, but we got two burgers and two carrot sandwiches and all of the sides (yes, all of them).  Also it's important to note we brought our own wine (bonus!).

I'm going to start backwards because I can and because I can't stop thinking about it... THE CARROT SANDWICH.  It sounds weird, right?  Carrots, a sandwich... why?  How?  But shut your mouth and stop asking questions.  Why does the sun shine and the rain fall - it just does.  It's what is supposed to happen.  Just like you, and everyone else, are supposed to eat this carrot sandwich.  I ALMOST don't even want to try to describe it to you for fear of not doing it justice.  I'm also just sitting here wondering why I've never had a carrot sandwich before?  Did my parents not love me?  Mouth watering fresh bread, Apple cider glazed carrots, chicabiddy cheese and parsley sauce.  I cannot even.  I can't.

Let's move on before I self-combust and have to drive back to Pennsylvania and mug someone for a carrot sandwich.  My parents got the burgers - I had a bite of my moms and WOW.  It was one of those bites that you want to scarf down because it's so good, but also savor so you remember what great tastes like.  The fries might have stolen the show though... I'm sorry to say.  Imagine kennywood fries but 1000x better.  Yea, I said it.

Digressing to the starters - Watermelon soup.  Hot, flavorful, savory.  We licked the bowls.  Farro/Potato - YES.  Fun, different, a little taste punch in your mouth.  Beats - we were fighting over them.  

If I could give The Vandal 10 stars, I would.  My parents have already invited their entire friend group to go back - and I'm jealous.  See you when I get home Vandal!"}
{"text":"Came here after I saw that a couple of my friends have been here as of late. The decor of the place is quite interesting ... very trendy, very hip ... and has both window seating and small sit-in tables. 
Unfortunately, the food ... probably not as up to par. No, I'm not necessarily or merely talking about how the food tasted, because the burger with the tomato mayo was quite delicious (that tomato mayo was especially quite tasty), the mac & cheese was alright (amount of cheese used was sufficient, but I found it to taste overly milky for some strange reason), and the fries were alright, but the price is a bit hard to swallow. Portion size for the mac & cheese appetizer ($4) came in a weeny small tray and that's not even referring to the burger ($11), that of which I could have gotten a bigger one almost anywhere else and most likely for cheaper. The iced coffee was alright ... they also give you squeeze bottles to use before you take it so that you can adjust the levels of milk and sugar to your liking. 
So overall impression ... overhyped & underwhelming. Definitely see the potential though. Might give it a try again later down the road after it's had some time to acclimate and grow."}
{"text":"Locally sourced, creative, delicious dining.  Executive Chef, Csilla Thackray, certainly got the job done with her all woman crew. We ordered everything vegetarian from the menu and we were delighted with all of our choices. 

If you are a foodie, get here quick, there's lots to appreciate and enjoy. 

Our service was excellent and the arrival of the courses was perfectly paced.

A $5 corkage for the wine seemed reasonable, it's a little less for beer. 

Overall, an excellent meal and we will be back again soon."}
{"text":"I tried a bite of my friends burger and fries ($11). The burger was excellent, the spread was rich but not overwhelming and the meat was very tasty. Fries were excellent. 

I had the shiitake sandwich ($11), which was grilled mushrooms, cheese, and shavings of a cured pork. Good blend of flavors and overall tasty sandwich, but I thought the baguette was too chewy and wish it came with a small side or some fries like the burger does. Lastly, the Mac n cheese was really disappointing. It was $4 for a small, really flavorless portion. I ended up adding salt and pepper, but didn't finish it anyways. Unfortunately the other sides were pretty pricy ($7), so it's hard to sample the menu without spending a good amount. I feel like when your menu is composed of 5 sandwiches and 5 sides, it's worthwhile to make sure each dish is up to par, and was surprised that they haven't improved the Mac n cheese! 

Overall the burger certainly lived up to the hype! I will definitely be back for that."}
{"text":"I just ate here after reading about it online and I'm disappointed... with how much money I spent. The food is good, and the atmosphere is hip, but holy ****, I just spent $35 on 4 meager pieces of chicken, A scoop of gourmet Mac n cheese, some pickled green beans that I didn't eat, and some delicious okra. I was so shocked by how little food we got, that I practically interrogated the server when she dropped off the food. \"THIS is a meal for two?\" I asked. \"Yes.\" she replied. \"This is the whole order? Like... everything?\" I responded. She clearly saw the sincere disappointment in my eyes and brought me additional food (without me asking) which was nice of her. Anyway, I think you're paying an unnecessary \"trend tax\" by eating here; it's a cool place in Lawrenceville with subway tile walls and an exposed support beam ceiling, but damn... the chicken wasn't even THAT good. I could've gotten just as much food at Union for half the price."}
{"text":"Food is solid guys. It's local, it's thoughtful, it's nicely prepared, you'll enjoy it. But onto a more important matter. You spend your money on frivolous things; your cars, your distressed jeans, your $6 cup of coffee. That's cool, get what makes you happy. Dining out is a routine occurrence for some, an indulgence for others. Did you know that Joey donates a portion of his profits every Wednesday to a local cause? My friends and I have been going for months to support this endeavor. We are lucky to be able to enjoy each other's company in a cozy cafe with high quality food among like-minded patrons. If you are feeling hopeless, stressed, and questioning humanity...volunteer, be kind, be generous....and grab some friends and hit The Vandal on a Wednesday. It's cheaper than therapy."}
{"text":"Nicest guy ever behind the counter (one of the owners?). These were the BEST french fries I have ever had. No lie. Small menu that packs a huge amount of flavor. Yummy burger. But those fries! Burger, burger, meat, meat. Go here."}
{"text":"I love the ambience and interior design of this cafe: modern, bright, and relaxing. I have been to many cafes that have a similar vibe, but they often serve mediocre food. The Vandal, however, excels with both the decor and food. I had the smoked trout--great flavor and interesting combinations of ingredients. The server was really friendly and welcoming. I cannot wait to come back to try their breakfast and brunch menu."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Wednesday. We didn't have any trouble getting a table. You order at the front and then take a seat and your food is brought out to you. My
Mom and I split the beets and ricotta, the ricotta and leek tart, and the polenta. It was all delicious and actually more than enough food for a lunch once we had finished the hearty polenta. The tart was simple but tasty. The beets were unexpectedly warm and also really nice. The polenta was very filling. Made with buckwheat and a duck egg. There were some kind of unidentifiable flavors in it, something cheesey, something spicy. Only criticism of this dish is that it could have had some more texture and we would have preferred the duck egg to be warm instead of cold. Great coffee too! And friendly staff"}
{"text":"I don't think it gets any more delicious in Lawrenceville than The Vandal! I had the pork sandwich (pork, kale chips, apple topping, dijon mustard on italian-style bread), macaroni and cheese and lavender vanilla lemonade. I can't say a single bad thing about my meal. It was beyond amazing and I immediately starting thinking about when I can come back to eat there again. The only downside is that it is a little expensive to enjoy as a regular lunch spot. I spent $20+ when it was all said and done, but don't regret it at all obviously. The food is served on pastel-colored trays reminiscent of the kind of trays you'd get in the grade school cafeteria, but more stylish."}
{"text":"Went to vandal because we needed something quick to eat after Christmas shopping in lawrenceville and glad we did. 
Food was top notch and it's clear the chef is classically trained. Chic food on paper plates is the best way to describe it. 
They also had the best lavender tea I've ever had. It's byob and order at the counter but it's definitely worth a stop in. I hope they keep the food as the star and stay away from the trap of becoming a bar. 
The only reason I give it a four is we went late and they ran out of a couple menu items."}
{"text":"This place is unique and innovative from any of the places I've been to in Pittsburgh.. they have this creativity in their dishes from the presentation to the flavor to the making of a dish. Everything seems very thoughtfully put together with love and passion... the effort shows in each plate! If you're open to trying something new and different definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"I've waited a long time to go here, let me just say it was well worth the wait.
 I came for lunch on rainy Friday afternoon it was getting close to closing and there were only a few other diners there. The look is very clean and cool and unpretentious. The waiter was very friendly and helpful and waited one me right away.
The menu was small with about six or eight items, that ranged from soup and salad to burgers and fish.
I ordered the rose ice tea to start, it was fresh made and really tasted and didn't need any sweetener. I decided to try the burger which came with fresh cut fries. 
The kitchen is open to the dining area which I always love, it's fun to watch talented folks do what they love.
The burger, which I ordered medium, was cooked perfectly! It came with a great mix of peppery greens and a tomato.
It was so fresh and delicious I could see why all the attention.
It's a great stop and I will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for a casual brunch for 2-4 people. The interior is modern and clean with white marble tables and indie music playing in the background. My fianc√© and I came here for brunch on Saturday around 11am. We only waited 5 minutes for an indoor table. They have a couple tables outside that seat 2-3 people. We got the beignets, which were SO DELICIOUS with the lemon curd! I loved my quiche with goat cheese and a salad. He got the fried chicken sandwich with the egg, and it was the bomb. Highly recommend checking out this place!"}
{"text":"Inexcusably bad service. Food came out at different times, food that should have been hot was cold, food that should have been edible was not, no one came back to check after food was delivered (which was inedible), no one refilled brew coffee, no one cleared table or asked if we needed anything more. I had to leave my seat to discuss my concerns with an employee, who conveyed that no one was in charge. ZERO understanding of hospitality from the top down. Will not recommended or return."}
{"text":"We came in early on a Sunday morning (just a wee bit past 9) for bunch. There were four other groups seated, so several spots still open. We were seated right by the door, not optimal when there were other tables against the wall and further away from the door. (This morning it was barely 10 degrees out.) They seated the next two pairs in the open spot, near the wall. Strange we didn't get that offer.

We placed an order for a chicken sandwich and duck hash. It arrives in a timely fashion. The chicken sandwich is tasty, with a nice balance of sweetness from the honey. The duck hash was okay and liked the sweet potatoes in lieu of regular potatoes. The portions was were rather small and the hash needed some salt and pepper.

Here is where I knock of stars. We wanted ketchup and salt and pepper, but couldn't seem to flag a waitress. I tried multiple attempts, even saying \"excuse me\" twice and didn't get so much as a blink in my direction. We had given up when I caught the eye of the barista and mouthed the condiments request. He promptly brought it over. 

We were heading out and the waitress ask if we needed a physical receipt. Strange question. No, we responded. We were told it's okay to pay up front. We did and now I see what she meant. You don't even see an itemized receipt at all, just the total. From a customer perspective, not great as you might want to review before paying should there be a mistake or question.

Anyhoos, food is good (though relatively pricey) that we'll come back, but only in warmer weather. The number of people opening the door in/out left our food cold fast."}
{"text":"GREAT food, fun ambience. No frills. Beets were done just right, burger really tasty and juicy, butternut squash soup delicious as was the lamb stew. Fries were fried just right - fresh and not underdone or overlooked. Very impressive!"}
{"text":"You really can't underestimate the difference a personal touch makes and the Vandal knows that.  I selected this place as the \"V\" in my A-Z Dining list and made a reservation for 6 since it's a tiny place.   My A-Z list is published online and the owner, Joey, ran across our event.  He took the time to reach out a couple days ahead and insisted on making our evening special.   Fantastic!

Fast forward to the evening of our dinner.  We had a couple last minute cancels, so we were a party of four instead of six.  They weren't super busy and didn't give us any grief.  Everyone was friendly and knowledgeable.   We started with two appetizers - the salt roasted beets and the kohlrabi, duck confit, apple cider, sweet potato escabeche.  The beets were done just right and exactly what I expected.  The kohlrabi dish was hands down the best dish of the night.  A great mix of textures and flavors and I could have ordered three of them.   

The appetizers were followed by a commentary cup of the borscht - a gift from the owner.  Now, this is not a dish I would have ever ordered because I'm not fond of dill; however, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The dill is well balanced by the other ingredients and the soup has a nice earthy quality that was really pleasing.  Joey came around to greet us and make sure we had everything we needed.   

We got three different entrees - the pork, the roulade, and the tortellini.  The tortellini was mine - not the best dish of the night, but a very solid offering.   After that, we ordered a dessert for the table.  We weren't really hungry, but couldn't pass up the combo of chocolate cake and goat cheese.   It was not too sweet and had a nice texture - a winner overall.   While we were eating it, Joey stopped by to say goodbye and make sure we enjoyed our meal.   

At the end of the day, I loved the visit...and even more so because of the personal touch.   I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had an excellent breakfast today! Soft ricotta scramble and biscuit sandwich were outstanding. We contemplated the beignets, but didn't go that route; however, we may have missed out because they looked awesome!!!! Portions were great and the house brew coffee was really great too. We loved the atmosphere and the staff was pleasant. Had to grab 2 lattes on the way out. Will definitely be back - make the trip to Lawrenceville to Vandel. Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this addition to Lawrenceville!  

The restaurant is kind of unique and bears description - you order your food and pick it up at the counter, though the food is the same quality that you'd eat at any of Pittsburgh's fine dining restaurants.  That said, The Vandal is fabulous for breakfast and lunch, but not necessarily the place you'd take a date or go for a special occasion.  

The staff is always wonderfully friendly, and I love that the Vandal has fun with themselves (no, not in that way) by doing things like theme nights."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh is known for its hole in the wall food joints, this is definitely not one to get lyrical about. The concept is brilliant, but the execution lacking at best. I loved the camomile iced tea and hated the runny egg floating in beans thing (with some fancy sounding hipster name). The staff don't know how to smile either - which probably made the experience worse than it actually was. Three things need to change if the Vandal wants to survive:
1. Unfriendly employees.
2. Waiting forever for an order.
3. Lack of value / expensive (i.e. very small portions for the money spent)."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. Small portions, high prices, some dishes more successful than others. We ordered bread and butter ($6) but the dinner roll was so doughy and undercooked that it was pretty inedible. My mesclun salad was good, with a few flavorful mushrooms in the mix. The scallops were also very tasty but, again, a scant portion. My sister ordered a pasta dish that had an unusual taste, not in a good way. The pistachio custard also had a different taste, this time a success. I would not come here for dinner again, however, judging from the reviews, I would definitely give breakfast a try. The pictures are tempting!"}
{"text":"This place represents the transformation of the Pittsburgh food scene.  To state the food is delicious would be an understatement. I got the homemade biscuit sandwich with bacon, egg, and white cheddar.  What seems like a simple breakfast staple, is anything but.  

The restaurant is clean!  Unlike Pamela's and other local brunch/lunch places, The Vandal is clean.  The kitchen can be viewed from any seat in the restaurant, which allows you to watch the chefs cook up everyone's meals.  It holds everyone accountable and provides some entertainment. 

It is also affordable.  For the quality and cleanliness, The Vandal is worth the price.  

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Home for Christmas and was walking down the street and this new place caught my eye. Walked in bc I loved the decor and it reminded me of a little NYC spot. 

Staff helped me make up my mind as I wanted to try everything. I've been in the restaurant industry for close to 10 years and have been in every position from bus boy, manager and chef. I always wanna eat everything lol. 

Anyways got the pork sandwich and it was fabulous. Great flavor and combination of ingredients. Would def make a stop back here for sure next time I'm home. 

As mentioned it's not really a 1st date place but great for couples to come in and hang for a little. Order a few things and have them come out at different times. 

For those n00bs out there. This isn't a fast food joint. It's pretty apparent you order and then take your number and sit down and the food is brought to you. It's also a BYPB place so yeah hence why no drink list. 

I feel like on any review people are so worried on focusing on he bad things or small bits that the good is lost. 

Sure it also may be on the pricy side but all ingredients are sourced locally and are premium. These so called foodies on Yelp just crack me up sometimes. They think they know it all yet thy never even spend a minute on the other side of the counter or in a kitchen."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for brunch in Pittsburgh. Its small, but it's worth the wait. The food was perfect, the coffee was the best I've had in town (I ordered a cortado) and it is so charming inside. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here! The food was great and I loved the tile/exposed brick decor. Plus, it is right next to Kickback, so grab a sandwich and then go play some pinball! You order at the counter, find a seat and they will give you a number and bring you the food. I personally liked the counter at the window, but there were plenty of table tops available too.

My boyfriend and I split the Burger, the Chicken sandwich and a side of Mac & Cheese and they were all delicious! The burger was cooked well, the chicken was crispy and both types of meat were super juicy.   Sometimes mac and cheese noodles are overdone and too mushy, but this was perfect...I am a macaroni and cheese maniac and theirs was very creamy and delicious!

A little pricey for sandwiches, but if you are more concerned with the quality/preparation of your food than getting the cheapest deal, you will be very satisfied like I was! The sandwiches were not huge, but definitely worth it for a good quality meal."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and staff all deserve high compliments. The burgers we ordered however do not. The first set were under done. So were the second.  We were given a refund and all is forgiven."}
{"text":"Great, great place. Super low-key but everything tastes (and looks) great. Their chef team is awesome."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to the Vandal last Sat. at 11am for brunch.  I'd been wanting to visit the Vandal since it opened, but this was my first visit given that I don't often do sit-down meals in Lawrenceville.  However, we're fans of the dining scene there, so we decided to go a bit out of our way to try something new and different (to us, at least!).

For our orders, both of my friends had the soft scramble with ricotta cheese ($11), and I had the brunch special ($10), which consisted of chicken confit, pickled veggies, and rye toast.  Additionally, we ordered vanilla lemonades ($3 each) to accompany our entrees.  All of the components of the brunch special were flavorful, and yet they melded together really nicely, creating a unique marriage of flavors.  Given that I didn't try my friends' entree, I can only speak for my own, but they seemed to enjoy theirs.  As for the vanilla lemonades, they were refreshing and delicious like a typical lemonade, but tasted quite different due to the vanilla infusion.  As my friends pointed out, the vanilla was unsweetened, so its flavor was more akin to that of vanilla extract than it was to that of vanilla ice cream.

Overall, we enjoyed our visit to the Vandal.  The restaurant's description of their fare as \"fine casual\" sums up the experience quite nicely--the ordering/serving format is fast casual but the food is fine dining-esque in ingredients and composition.  In light of this, it shouldn't come as a surprise that the pricing is closer to Big Burrito than it is to Pamela's."}
{"text":"It was ok, a little underwhelming. I did not enjoy watching the chefs cook in an open view kitchen.. 
without a hair net or using gloves. I ended up just getting a latte, it was ok."}
{"text":"Cute place with great coffee! I ordered the chicken sandwich which was amazing. I'm not sure I'll be able to order anything else because it was so tasty. 

My only complaint is that it was a bit warm and muggy inside."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" is exactly how I would describe this - I wanted to like it so much! Was pretty pumped looking at other Yelp reviews. Vegan options pretty limited, even though a pre-brunch phone call to an enthusiastic member of staff suggested all kinds of vegan excitement was available.
Potato hash - while not bad, was probably the most boring thing imaginable. Think college apartment cupboards the day before a much-needed trip to the grocery store. Probably four red-skinned potatoes quartered and drowned in oil, a handful of shriveled corn kernels, a few thin pepper slices, and an entire half an onion, for good measure. Seasoning - none, apart from salt, which was spot-on. Culinary genius for my broke and disorganized college self, not quite what I expected for $10 from a professional. Drip coffee was just okay.
On the plus side, staff very pleasant and just the right amount of attentive, no issues there at all. And we were seated right away, unlike some of the other reviews.
Probably wouldn't come back, though I'd be willing to try a special brunch menu or something like that. Too many other stellar breakfasts in Pittsburgh to spend time on the blah!"}
{"text":"I was really happy with my dinner here last night. We were originally planning on going somewhere on Penn Ave, but we hadn't realized it was First Fridays. So, we headed down to Butler, parked and walked around deciding where to go. I checked in with the Vandal to see if there were vegetarian options and the waiter who spoke to me was unbelievably nice! The dish I wanted could be made vegetarian so we went and got a window seat. It had a very old school cafe vibe mixed with the \"hip\" as they were playing Tupac the whole time, which I enjoyed. It was a smaller place with a handful of tables and a direct view of the kitchen, which was cool. There was a small delay because of a brief loss of power in the kitchen, so they sent us out a complimentary appetizer while we waited for the one we had ordered. Really unique stuff! They used somewhat bizarre vegetables that I honestly never heard lf before in their appetizers, and it was awesome. The first one seemed like a cousin to brocccoli but far more tasty, fried in tempura with a spicy curry sauce. The second was a garden salad type of dish with beets and pickled root vegetables with a  buttermilk sauce underneath. Very unusual and also good. My main dish was a fettuccine with some grated parm, edamame, mushrooms and a quail egg. I enjoyed it. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Favorite pgh restaurant. Small, inventive menu done perfectly. Wonderful fresh salads, creative pastas, delicious mains. Also, byob, which makes it the cheapest excellent meal around."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The pasta is always on point and Joey, the owner/manage is awesome.  Check this place out, byob btw."}
{"text":"This is a nice small restaurant typical of the newbies here in the Burgh. The food great!!! Super plus I will go back. Price reasonable. The service was not great the waiter was not in great service mood or she just don't like to wait tables. But the good ambiance and great food are notable."}
{"text":"We had dinner at The Vandal back in January on a Tuesday night. Joey greeted us at the door and was very welcoming. He opened our BYOB (Pizza Boy beer, there is a small corkage fee) and gave us some great recommendations for food. We ordered 'all the radishes', Hungarian crepes (w/smoked trout), green custard & quail egg, and corzetti pasta w/hazelnut & orange. The dishes were delicious. Each plate used the ingredients in very creative and unexpected ways. We got the chocolate cake on the house and that was delightful as well. The service was extremely personable and made for a memorable experience. Can't wait to see what else they come up with for dinner; we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The Vandal is the best in Lawrenceville - a must-go. 

The team behind the Vandal has done an excellent job executing a refined and delicious menu with the space to match.  What i call a \"new-school\" restaurant which, unfortunately Pittsburgh has been too slow to adapt to: The food is seasonal, menu very short (preferred), thoughtfully prepared with unique touches and execution outstanding.  

The space is fresh, bright, airy, quaint and understated. Two outdoor tables and a bench to accommodate the lines that will become a common occurrence.  The open kitchen lets us know this place is all about the food - not some coffee shop that serves sammies. There is a separate beverage bar which had lots of interesting options. We had the birch beer (bottled) in Natrona, PA.  

The chicken sandwich was incredible - will quickly become a signature item. Crispy fried chicken, butter toasted brioche, slaw, and spicy honey sweetness - excellent.  Hands down, the best chicken sandwich in Pittsburgh. 

The fries were also incredible. Fresh potatoes, not frozen, perfectly seasoned, piping hot out of the fryer, we enjoyed as an appetizer. May rival some of the best fries in Pittsburgh. Served with an aioli and ketchup. 

The pesto with ricotta, grilled bread and pickled chanterelles was also exceptional - the pesto only lacking salt.  The bread is browned, oily and chewy, a welcome vehicle for the ricotta/pesto combo. The pickled chanterelles were the perfect pop of tart to the ensemble only made me want to ask for more - only 2 on the plate - i know, they're expensive! That said, i've never been served a chanterelle in Pittsburgh ever - points for that. 

Service was fine, nice, but not overly so.  A few small mis-steps were quickly corrected.  Attention should be paid so as to not give a guest a menu with food stains on it. 

The Vandal is one place that is doing everything right - i would enjoy coming to on a regular basis, knowing that the menu will be constantly changing and i wouldn't want to miss it. As long as they don't change a thing about the chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian, I was so excited to find out they had options on their menu. The eggplant sandwich was amazing! The fries and Mac and Cheese were also delicious. It was a relaxed atmosphere with perfectly sized portions. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Today I ate probably the best quiche I've ever eaten. It was so light and airy and the flavor was amazing. The crust was flaky and light and cooked wonderfully. The coffee was also really good!

I'll definitely be back to try their lunch or dinner menus."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here for brunch on a Sunday morning. I didn't know but they change their menu up weekly so I was surprised to see they didn't have any vegan options on the menu. I asked the girl and he checked with the kitchen and they were able to make me something they used to offer (red potatoes and veggies). It was really good! The vibe in the place is really cool too. Would def come back! I hope they will always keep at least one item on the menu vegan though."}
{"text":"Excellent place! We had a terrific dinner and that night the restaurant was donating a share of the proceeds to charity. Eating good and doing good, an excellent combination."}
{"text":"This restaurant seems to have matured some since its opening and I must say, I am very impressed. This time we went for dinner, expecting the same casual atmosphere as lunch, and we were surprised to find a high-end candle lit atmosphere. Immediately after ordering, a series of delightful hors d'oeuvre are brought out from the kitchen at rapid fire. Delicious and unique flavor combinations indicative of a very intelligent and creative chef. We are already in heaven by the time our meal comes out and suddenly it gets even better. The ravioli with mushrooms was divine! Beautiful complex flavors with wine, cream, fish eggs. Unbelievably good! We finished off with an order of the pickle tray because we were so impressed with one of the pickled hors d'oeuvres that we had to try a larger sampling. Devine again. The BYOB status puts it over the edge! You can bring your own wine! Next time we will bring a bottle. And our meal was somehow under $50! Plus our waiter was the actual owner and was very pleasant and patient to talk to. You can tell he cares a lot about his restaurant. So yeah, that's as good as it gets. I am bringing my parents here next time they are in town."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for breakfast, and it was not what we were expecting. When we drove past it in the past we thought it was a cafe with a large variety of American breakfast and lunch items, but the food options were unconventional for American breakfast and lunch. Also, they were pricier and fancier. 

I liked what we ordered, but it's not what I expected. My girlfriend is a picky eater so she was not there biggest fan. We both did not like the atmosphere. The decor was saying the cafe was fancy, but they blasted rap music over speakers at 7am.

The food was okay, the coffee and lattes were great, and the atmosphere was confusing. This is not my type of cafe."}
{"text":"Nice place with a menu you just have to try. The bacon, egg, cheese busicts are to die for, they are meal by themselves alone. Music is pretty decent too."}
{"text":"I love the Vandal's vibe! You order and pay at the counter, which automatically sets it apart from other \"fine casual\" places. My friend and I grabbed menus and sat at a table for a moment to browse. First we ordered coffee and beignets, and thirty minutes later we returned to the counter to put in an order for breakfast biscuits and beets. The food was familiar, yet totally out of the ordinary. All the staff are extremely welcoming, especially the owner who checked on us a few times. The delicious food, friendly staff, and cool setup make the Vandal a great place to \"hang out,\" just like their motto says."}
{"text":"A modern-hip eatery located in the heart of lawerenceville. The staff are very welcoming and chipper. The daily menu with different selections allows the consumer to try something new each time. Great vibes inside. Enough about the place more about the food. WOW. Perfectly cooked chicken. The pairings for the chicken with the ginger and slaw was to die for! Can't wait to return to try something new!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Saturday afternoon with my wife for brunch.  I had been wanting to come to the Vandal for quite a long time due to the awards and press that it was getting.  We arrived to the restaurant shortly before 12 to find the only open table being the one out on the sidewalk.  Due to this I didn't really get to see much of the inside of the restaurant.  Our table location was actually quite nice since it was in the shade but my wife had to deal with a plant almost draped over her and I dealt with a quite uneven sidewalk such that my chair wobbled.  In any case neither of those ended up affecting our lunch at all.

My wife and I both decided to start off our brunch by ordering a cup of coffee.  Then for my entree I decided to go with the fried chicken sandwich with an egg while my wife went with the biscuits and gravy.  Our coffee came out first and upon our first sip both my wife and I caught some bitterness at the finish.  The beans were definitely freshly roasted though and I am wondering if they didn't have enough time to rest as the longer my cup sat there the more that bitterness turned into a nice sweetness.  So by the end of our cups both my wife and I were really enjoying it.  I was sort of disappointed by the size of the fried chicken sandwich whenever it came out as it looked to be about the same size as a spicy chicken from Wendy's and at $10 that seemed a bit small.  Thankfully the chicken in it was pretty good as it had a nice breading to it and was juicy inside.  Similarly the aioli had a good flavor to it.  Where I think that it missed was with the chili honey and the eggs.  I could certainly taste the sweetness of the honey throughout the whole sandwich but never did get that spiciest that I was craving until after it was gone and I took a pepper flake from plate.  Then the egg was sort of bizarre.  Normally whenever you order an egg on the sandwich it is over easy but this one was unevenly cooked but mostly over hard.  So whenever I cut into it I got a little yolk from one side but the rest didn't go anywhere.

The bottom line for me is that I might head back here again in the future.  Honestly the meal was decent but ended up being a letdown compared to the hopes that I had for The Vandal.  Maybe next time I will try dinner and hope that comes out a little better."}
{"text":"I hate when I feel like I'm alone in the Yelp community in my reviews. But this was a miss for me. Came in for brunch on a Sunday with my brother and cousin. When we first walked in, let me tell you I did not feel welcome. The girls working the cafe area that seat you just really weren't welcoming. 

Whatever so we sit down and order drinks. My chai was literally just a step above cold. But not warm. Tasted fine though. 

Food: My cousin just wanted a couple eggs, no toast, no \"salad\" (as they call it) just 2 scrambled eggs. Waitress said they can't do that because the chef likes to stick to the menu. Lady, this is a $13 brunch restaurant not a 5 Michelin Star spot. She then said that could take a me y item and completely deconstruct it though and completely change a menu item, but not just give 2 eggs. Again, COME ON. 

Ok so let's review the actual food. My fried chicken sandwich was super dry. I will say that since my cousin had to get a meal and got the ricotta scramble, those were really delightful. My brother got the duck and said he liked that also. Back to this salad though, salad is $2 and it's literally 5 pieces of greens. Mmmmmkkkkkk. 



Anyways, I have been trying to make it to Vandal for about a year, so I was pretty disappointed and don't need to be back."}
{"text":"Cute little hipster joint where you can get some pretty amazing and very well prepared food. Came here for brunch over the weekend and we were really surprised by this hidden gem. It's a small little joint, so when it gets busy, you'll have to wait outside to be seated because there's really no place to wait. Anyhow, food was amazing and coffee was great too. Service was on-point. Would definite recommend this place and will definitely be back next time we're in time."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and was in Pittsburgh on business trip when someone suggested this place, first let me tell you that the enthusiasm of the staff is contagious, it's a low key place with high tailored food, without a doubt one of the best burgers I've ever had moist and flavorful. The chicken dish , outstanding, takes 6 hours to make it and it's worth every minute. Farm to table has never tasted this good . With the uber ride
It's byob but there's a packy(Boston term) 2 blocks down"}
{"text":"I was in the other week. My food was cold and the staff seemed overworked. The chefs  could Audibly be heard discussing customers. Overrated and expensive"}
{"text":"I loved The Vandal! I was waiting for this place to open and it did not disappoint!. I had the bone marrow burger with fries and an order of mac n' cheese. The burger was great! I'm not sure where the marrow was but I assumed it was mixed in with the meat. It was incredibly juicy and the tomato mayo was awesome! I was a little sad that the fries came plain but I will say that they were perfectly crispy. Lastly, I have grown quite picky of mac n' cheese but this was creamy and somewhat sweet in a really good way. I can't wait to see how this rotating menu develops. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dessert with a friend. Despite being busy we were able to sit at the high top area. The server was friendly and helpful! We got the pink chiffon cake and both had a drink (latte and tea). Everything was great and only made me more excited to come back to try it for dinner!"}
{"text":"The vandal has fresh, innovative food, a friendly staff and a great atmosphere. It's consistently good and they always have something new or different on the menu. I especially recommend the ham biscuit for brunch. It's breakfast sandwich nirvana!"}
{"text":"This is a neat little spot right on Butler Street in Lawrenceville. The guy at the front desk who was also our waiter was super friendly. Coffee and Food here was excellent. We we're here around Lunch time on a Friday and it wasn't crowded and food didn't take long at all. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I definitely ordered the wrong thing (hostel breakfast).  It consisted of two pieces of toast, a scoop of yogurt and preserves, a soft boiled egg, and some arugula with vinegar on it.  Very disappointing and weird, I definitely expected something different based on what it said on the menu but it was hard to eat and bland and 12 dollars!! Not good service either and average, overpriced coffee.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"\"When I think of some of the things that have been done in the name of science, I have to cringe. No, wait, not science, vandalism. And not cringe, laugh.\"       -Jack Handey 

And not vandalism, The Vandal! And not laugh, cheer! 

This place has got it goin on. The beautiful white storefront sporting the ironically threatening words, \"The Vandal\", is the initial greeting. I lurked inside and with a quick assessment of my surroundings, Yelp's \"Is this place hipster?\" question was answered with a resounding \"Yes\". The interior designer in me was quite impressed. All components blended and set the other off with a clean, informal class. The white subway tile bar with wood countertops; marble tabletops surrounded by walls of brick, rugged white plaster and artsy wallpapers, finishing with a herringbone wood floor and exposed wood rafters. Hanging from the ceiling was a chalkboard menu with words of happiness and bodily fulfillment written thereupon. 

Schnitzel, it said in the top right hand corner. How could I Not order a food such a beautiful name? It was prepared, brought out to me and, Phew boy, did I have some room in my stomach for that Schnitzel! It was pork loin (breaded of course) with potato salad, a fried egg and pickled fennel. Perfection. Plenty of food without overstuffment and plenty  of taste with a wonderful palate cleansing pile of pickled fennel. And I'm tellin you now, that there Schnitzel was goin down, and we were out of there on the run (I'm not actually joking) to get to La Gourmandine before it closed. 

It should be noted that my henchfriend wouldn't quit saying that his AM burger was one of the nicest things he'd ever eaten, and I'd join him with some of my own similar praise. \"Better'n McDonalds?\" I asked. He snorted, then said with no trivial amount of sarcasm, \"No, definitely not better than McDonalds.\" Then later, \"Man, I'd give The Vandal Six stars if I could.\" Truth. I think now, as I make my failed attempt at attaching that sixth star."}
{"text":"I'm glad I finally got to check this place out. I came in around 7pm on a Saturday, and surprisingly did not have a problem finding a place to sit, given it's a fairly small space. 

I expected more of a caf√© style environment, but it was dimly lit with nice candles for mood lighting. You have to go up front to order which I was a bit confused about at first, given all the ambiance. I felt like I needed to be seated to get served. But I quickly realized, and fell in line. It's quite an interesting and refreshing mix of casual and intimate all at the same time.

I ended up ordering the salad, the soup, and the chicken mousse sandwich. I was kind of bummed I couldn't get the fries as an addition to the sandwich, but I understand it takes them a long time to make, so they only serve them with the burger. 

The salad was different. I was kind of on the edge of whether I liked it or not. It was literally like I went outside and picked leaves from a bush, with all the stems. I think that's what threw me off. But it had a nice light dressing, delicious shaves of cheese, and a pile of savory mushrooms on the side. Not bad.

The soup was a parsnip and carrot soup with paprika and a dollop of sour cream. All of those ingredients had very distinct flavors, and when swirled together were really great.

My main dish, the chicken mousse sandwich was awesome. I don't remember everything that was on it, but it had crispy fried onions, and what I think was a mustard seed paste that packed a punch, on some nice crusty toasted bread. It was perfect. 

My friend got the burger, which I had a bite of, and holy crap... I'm getting that next time. It was cooked perfectly, and the tomato mayo was to die for (and it comes with fries)!

Other than that, the service was great; they complimented us on our food decisions, which gave me confidence it'd be great. And I like that its BYOB because I have way too much wine at home that needs drinking. lol."}
{"text":"We went here around noon on a Sunday and were immediately seated. It was more casual than expected, but the environment itself is super nice. The server gave me a lot of information on the food when I asked her for recommendations, which was appreciated. I got the quiche, which was absolutely spectacular. I thought everything seemed a little expensive at first, but it was without a doubt worth it. The quiche was almost too pretty to eat, and it was both creamy and light at the same time. The mushrooms really stood out and all of the flavors were incredible. All in all, great place for brunch."}
{"text":"Just popped in here for brunch, after having driven past hundreds of time. Had the soft scramble, which was pretty much perfect in every way. Great atmosphere, very friendly staff; this place is a winner in every respect!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Fresh, simple menu is absolutely delightful. Current favorite on the menu is the eggplant dish but the guacamole toast and the biscuit--available for breakfast--are both phenomenal. Staff is friendly and helpful and the space is a big ol' breathe of fresh air. Great spot to grab yummy food with good friends. Done deal."}
{"text":"\"hi, we're The Vandal, and we're waaaaaaaay too hipster to give our food any flavor\"
5 real tho, this place straight nassstttyy.
overpriced and full of itself, the vandal is a hell i wouldn't wish on my worst enemy."}
{"text":"Today I learned a valuable lesson, if a fancy place with a limited menu has a burger as one of their options, GET THE BURGER!!! My husband taught me this when he shared a bite of what I thought was going to be a regular burger when it instead was probably the best burger of my life. Ron Swanson would approve of this burger despite him hating the hipster chic vibe of the decor. 

In other news, our other choices were very well made and the service very personable but that burger will now haunt my dreams for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"Stopped in around 840 on a Saturday night and was lucky to get a seat.  Had the cured trout crepes for an appetizer, they were excellent and got the burger and fries for dinner, excellent as well.  The atmosphere was great and I cannot say enough about the service.  They were friendly and genuine but not over bearing or too much in your face.   I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for consistently delicious, creative, locally-sourced food in a fun/funky/upscale BYOB environment, then this should be your jam. Everything is presented beautifully, too; plating is on point. Recent favorites: orange blossom beignets at breakfast and chilled sorrel soup at dinner. 

It was a little hot the last time I went in because of the open kitchen on a hot day, but they told me that they are about to insulate the ceiling and change that up a bit. Other than that bit of heat, this would be an incredibly awesome spot for a date--not too formal, good people-watching on Butler, stellar food and drink.

Pro tips: 

1) Snag a patio table for two if you can get one! 
2) Grab a cold one at Bierport a couple of blocks down the street - excellent craft beer and cider selection"}
{"text":"Love the scrapple. Chicken biscuits and gravy. It was delicious definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Well I heard this place was good and I must have heard wrong- It was great. 
Put that in your cliche pipe and smoke it. 

Really though, this place is fantastic. Clearly a french inspired chef, a restaurant with a rotating menu. Incredibly well thought and layered flavor profiles on rather simply built dishes. Smaller portions, higher prices, better food. I had the chicken and it was great. The owner was walking around greeting his guests and that makes all the difference. Mr. Sliver never comes to my table when I'm at the local long-john-silver's(Probably why they went out of business).

These two places aren't comparable in the same universe. So don't mind my sense of humor.

Wildly delicious food here. Negatives;The price is gouging for certain dishes. For $24...$30 after tip I usually expect to be filled at very least, but I was just satisfied with how delicious the food was. I was also there on a hot day and it was 1 trillion degrees inside. Not often a problem in Pittsburgh, but highly uncomfortable. But it's BYOB which kinda counters that."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch and it was a pleasant experience. It is byob but the wine and spirits store is about a block away so it's not an inconvenience at all. The staff are extremely nice, I wish that the brunch menu had an a la carte menu or larger selection with smaller meals on it. I ordered the egg scramble with ricotta cheese and it was amazing."}
{"text":"I ate here during a very adrenaline filled day before I was heading to the Kentucky derby. So this was a highly glorified mealtime for me. I met with close friend who works in Larryville on her lunch break. We walked in, sat at a high top window seat, checked the menu, and ordered appropriately. We both got burgers and fries. Nothing totally memorable. I need to give it a second chance. The best was the aioli they served with the fries. 

I would describe it as very inspired. A lot of heart goes into the food."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and delicious. The staff is courteous and organized. Very positive experience!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my breakfast here. The food was very fresh, and I enjoy the lightly dressed greens that I had with my meal. The wait for our table was a bit longer than expected, but it was warm outside so we didn't really mind. I thought the prices were a bit outrageous. $14 for scrambled eggs, toast, & greens... but it was really delicious, and if the service and quality is there, I don't mind spending the extra cash for a local business."}
{"text":"This place is done right. Cool vibe.. Lunch menu is expensive but very worth it.  I mean I could just compliment this place al day. Menu is clean and easy to understand, great coffee options. Portion size is spot on .. very happy with this place. They might have the best food in Pittsburgh. This is my little alone lunch spot that I love to take a break from work."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Farm to table in the description or something like that!! 
Veredicto and constructive criticism. 
If you make a quiche make it exciting. It had turnip in the description. But I only tasted like egg and a bit of goat cheese I could not find any turnip piece or flavor in it. Frisee salad? Had a few meager findings in it. Really? One slice of radish ? One piece of some kind of bacon? That was part of the quiche. We had the main salad... Same salad as the quiches' with something similar to 1/8 of a potato and 3 hydrated morels . Not fun a bit too salty. . My palate needs a bit of a contrast . 
The chicken sandwich was good a tiny bit hard to eat since chicken piece is smaller and thicker than bun so it felbut tasty.
Price.. I find a 14 dollar quiche triangle a bit steep. 
Total 44. For 3 things 1/3 was mostly salad.... 
So recommendation. Get the farm or market ingredients more mixed in.  For now I only think it's just ok.

{"text":"I guess it's about time I wrote a review, because I have literally eaten here or gotten takeout at least once or twice a week since they opened!  I mean, I like this place so much that they are on speed dial on my phone.  The ingredients are always fresh, and locally sourced when possible, the food is delicious -- although sometimes inconsistent, usually when they are super busy -- and the staff is super friendly and accommodating.

The atmosphere is great: minimalist, clean, but welcoming, with tons of natural light.  The staff is super laid back, and the manager Joey always makes a point to engage with visitors and to check that they are enjoying their food.

The chicken sandwich is absolutely killer, and the burger is very solid as well.  I am glad they changed it to include fries!  Also, I have enjoyed the pork sandwich (which changes regularly, but usually involves crispy kale) most of the times I have had it here.  I had the catfish sandwich once and did not like that as much.

This is a must-try place if you haven't been already!"}
{"text":"This tiny, hip restaurant was an ideal brunch spot. 

They've got an open kitchen concept, but instead of just seeing the tops of the heads of the line cooks, you can truly see the entire kitchen. 

The whole place had a clean, fresh vibe from the food, to the decor, to our very hip servers. 

I just had a drip coffee and the smoked Trout over latkes. My coffee was bold and earthy, but I personally wasn't crazy about my latkes - and I'm a potato fan from way back. 

But I did steal some of my dining partner's fried chicken sandwich that was perfectly tender. 

It seems like you can bring your own bubbly for mimosas too!"}
{"text":"We went to the Vandal to celebrate my birthday and the food was wonderful. We ordered the red snapper ceviche and it looked too pretty to eat. It was pretty tasty. I ordered the sunflower custard spelt thing that was just as pretty! It had a very unique flavor. I don't think I would order it again , but it was good.My friends ordered the duck terrine and it was delicious even though I'm usually not a fan of pate type food. The bread and butter were both amazing. 

The staff was welcoming and very nice. The atmosphere is very chill. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. It's a BYOB so don't forget your booze!"}
{"text":"I returned to The Vandal to give it another try. There have definitely been changes made, to both the layout of the restaurant and the quality of the service. I ordered the Strawberry Beignets and they were delicious. (One order comes with 4 beignets, so be prepared to share!) That and a cup of coffee was a satisfying brunch."}
{"text":"We had my brothers rehearsal dinner at Vandal. Wow!!! I am mostly vegetarian and vandal catered to all of my dietary needs. I even got a special salad made with no goat cheese! Joe was so helpful and friendly he told me exactly what was and wasn't vegetarian. He made a special pesto pasta for us and tasty Brussel sprouts! Everyone was so happy with the food and the service. They had pork loin and potatoes with onions. Everything was amazing (so I hear) but i loved the Pesto!!!"}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich with chile honey & rutabaga slaw was tasty with some sweetness. Chicken was very good..Chef said it was free range & came from a local farm..forget the name."}
{"text":"It was an overcast and rainy day as we walked through Lawrencevill to The Vandal. We wiped the raindrops as we walked through the threshold, revealing exposed beams, brick walls and hipsters. After a short wait, we were seated. We noted the limited seating. After skimming the menu, we ordered a fried chicken sandwich and a forgettable salad. He ordered a chocolate cold brew which he found to be enjoyable with a rich, full bodied flavor from the chocolate. The fried chicken sandwich was disappointing. Presentation was great, but it was flavorless and bland. I would go again for the coffee but I would pass and walk elsewhere for food."}
{"text":"Breakfast if in Lawrenceville at this place is a must!!! We wanted to eat everything on the menu. If you have 4 people you can get close. 

First the decor, lovely white wash brick and minimalist styling on the tables was quite inviting. Service was quick and ultimately friendly. 
We started wth a rhubarb muffin with wonderful jam and pecan roll for the table. Omg delicious buttery goodness. Had the smoked trout with potato latkes that were presented in a surprising format and so sooo good. Pierogies stuffed purple potatoes accompanied  pork sausage. I only tried the pierogies and DAMN! There's the requisite BEC on a biscuit. That biscuit; heavenly. Last but not least the short stack of blue corn pancakes. Oh were those good too! Yes. Really liked the space, food and company."}
{"text":"Never again. The owner, Joey, is very rude. I Wasn't feeling good (and it was cold out) and I knew my peppermint tea in my bag would make me feel better with my brunch... so I asked for hot water and I used my own tea bag (normally not something I do, actually never done before, but I ordered brunch too)... he flat out schooled me for bringing my tea. It was beyond shitty of him to do... he actually said to me \"I'm trying to make a living here... it's common courtesy not to bring in your own food... you actually brought that? \" I haven't had a guy talk to me like that... in the worst shitty tone in a very very long time... all he had to say was \"hey next time I have tea here, hope u feel better\" or say nothing at all. He tried to make up for it later with a complimentary rice pudding (which tasted way to sweet) but I was already pissed off and I was so embarrassed in front of my date. I've told almost everyone I know about this encounter- people who know him-- weren't surprised he acted that way. Too bad... especially for a new business owner. Karma."}
{"text":"Great ambience, amazing food! This place is BYOB. Tried Ginger beer for the first time and loved it! The chicken was tender and delicious and our server took great care of us despite the place being packed! Parking can be tricky especially after 6:30pm on weekends. Also, a big plus- Naturoll is right next door."}
{"text":"This place is so good, I'm afraid the secret is already out and now it's going to be more and more difficult to get in. Had lunch twice there last week, that ought to say something.  Notably, the fried chicken sandwich is fantastic. Savory with a hint of sweetness with the honey added. 

The owner chef, Joey is a really nice and creative guy. Always coming up with something interesting that you're not going to find elsewhere in the burg. All of the staff there are extremely friendly as well.  It's a comfortable and bright atmosphere looking out onto Butler Street.  

A winner!"}
{"text":"I have tried to go to this place several times, because I work nearby.  Their website says they're open until 3:30pm.  I've shown up at 3pm, 2:45 pm and even 2:30pm.  Their doors are open and there are \"employees\" inside, but they always say they are closed.  Is this a fake restaurant, or just the most poorly managed restaurant in the world??  Seriously.  Wow."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great cup of coffee. While the chicken sandwich on the brunch menu was good. The chicken was very dry. However, I loved the carrot slaw on it. I think the highlight of the table for me was the blood orange earl grey tea cake, which was beautiful as well as delicious."}
{"text":"Everything that comes from this kitchen makes you feel like you are their favorite customer.  The bacon biscuit is so incredible it makes it hard to try anything new.  Think ...dense scratch biscuit with thick cut perfectly cooked bacon and an egg that is so bright you don't even want to break that perfect yolk.  But then you do...because it's so damn good you want to soak up every last drop with that biscuit.  Then wash it down with the seasonal infused iced tea (currently ginger) and you can now proceed with you day :). It's quaint, hipster, whatever adjective you want to use go ahead...it's just plain good."}
{"text":"My first visit to The Vandal was my second restaurant week stop and by far the best stop I have had in the years I have done restaurant week.  The Vandal did not disappoint.  

I arrived a bit before my friend and they graciously brought bread to the table.  I'm not entirely sure if it was butter or cream cheese that they included with the bread - but whatever it was, it was amazing!

The Vandal offered 2 options for the 3 courses.  My friend and i decided to get both offerings and share so we could try more.  We also added the scallops off the regular menu.  

Not a single item disappointed us.  From the radishes to the chocolate cake.  Everything was phenomenal.  My personal favorite dish was the extra dish we ordered - the scallops.  They were the best thing I have eaten in a long time.  They melted in your mouth, the presentation was amazing.  Just an amazingly put together dish.

The owner came and spoke to us before and after our meal.  He was engaging and grateful for folks coming to the restaurant.  Since they change the menu often to take advantage of whatever is fresh at the time - I plan to go back.  Many times.  

Please go check it out.  They recently added dinner - and it is WELL worth ti."}
{"text":"I'm so happy this past weekend I got to try out the Vandal. I saw some hype for it through Instagram and was eager to stop in. First off, the decor is awesome. I don't know design terms, but to me it felt very LA and hip. There are cool marble table tops, a big bar (with a huge menu sign above) where you order your food and can see into the kitchen, and green plants throughout the space. I was originally going to get a burger, but the chicken meal of the day was recommended (4 pieces of chicken with 4 sides consisting of mac and cheese, pickled green beans, fried okra, and cornbread). The meal was awesome! We ate every last bit of our decent portioned meal. 

My only reason for giving this 4 instead of 5 stars is the wait for our take out order. It took a little over 20 minutes to get our meal, which was definitely cooked to order. I saw them coating the chicken before frying it. So it was quite fresh and I totally appreciated it but compared to other fresh take away places in town it felt a little long to wait. But the staff was so friendly and had us take a table and got us water. 

I'll be happy to go back and try everything else on the menu, honestly! Looking forward to a long run in Lawrenceville!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late brunch on Sunday and did not have to wait long for a table. The Vandal is very aesthetically pleasing with white marble tables and bright fresh flowers. My friend and I both started with the maple spice latte. I was kind of disappointed with the latte as I did not really get any spice or maple flavoring. I had the fried chicken sandwich and my friend had the soft scramble. Our food came out pretty quickly. The sandwich was delicious with the nice contrasting flavors of the sweet honey, creamy slaw, and crispy chicken. My friend enjoyed her scramble as well. Overall, a nice place to grab brunch in Lawrenceville. However, beware it was a little pricey. I really do not think the scramble should be $15."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to cater, based on our experience I highly do not recommend. Vandal catered an awards dinner we attended last night, and it was terrible. First, something happened to the truck, so there was no salad. The offerings were two large bowls of cold mac and cheese, and two platters of sandwiches. I chose the pulled beef slider with mustard and it would have been good, but the bun was soaked and again, the food was cold. My friend chose the roasted carrot sandwich and said it was terrible. There were no other sides or choices. It was a shame and totally diminished the event. ONE bright spot, there was a lovely lemonade drink that was delicious!"}
{"text":"Parking in Lawrenceville is nearly impossible except on Sundays when it is free! I  pulled in to a small lot near this place and when I went to register the car I noted the free parking.

So I walked in, the place is small but packed with people but I managed to find a table. The menu is on a chalkboard above the counter, you place your order and  they bring it out to you. Since today was Sunday brunch I saw that the special was a plate of bacon or ham with fried eggs, kale salad, and toast for $11.00. I saw one of them and thought too much fat on the bacon or it was burnt on another order so I decided to opt for something else.

I asked the counter manager his recommendation since this was my first time here. He said that I would enjoy the \"squash toast\". It is toast topped with caramelized onions and kale. I also ordered the yogurt and granola parfait to go with it. For a drink he recommended the lavender lemonade. So I went with that. Most everything else here is ala carte but I got away with $16.00 for my selections.

I paid for my breakfast and sat down. At each table they have tap water in a closed bottle. I received my meal fairly quick and the same man who took my order helped me out. I noticed that although I loved the toast it was a bit hard to cut with a knife. He took it back and had it cut for me. I asked him what type of bread they use for their toast. I was told they use sourdough bread from 5 points  which is some bakery over on Wilkins Ave in Squirrel Hill.

The food was very good and I got to chat with a couple at the next table. He was having a fried doughnut with a creme filling before the main course. He said that he often comes here for lunch and recommends I try the fried chicken sandwich. Sounds like a plan to me!

I noticed that they have take out and by the time I was finished this place was packed with people waiting for tables. My advice would be to get here early since this must be a popular place. When I left I took note of other businesses I thought interesting so it will definitely mean a return trip.

Eat like a vandal! The food is ravenously good!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for brunch and I'm never disappointed. Most recently I went for brunch on Mother's Day and it was amazing. It's BYOB and they're very accommodating of that. The food is amazing. I had the breakfast sandwich with bacon- amazing. I think the biscuit it was on made it so delicious. My mom had the parsnip tart and she couldn't get over how good it was. Same review of the fried chicken sandwich -phenomenal. 
Their coffee is also really good ! They have a good coffee selection. - drip, espresso, cold brew, lattes. We knew going into the day that they don't take reservations so we had someone arrive early to put our name on the waiting list but on a non-holiday, the wait is usually reasonable (half hour or less) And there are lots of shops nearby to kill a little time. I'd recommend stopping into Una boutique while you're waiting. 
Note that the menu at Vandal has varied over time but I think it just keeps getting better.

I have also gone here for dinner and feel less enthusiastic about the dinner but it was still good. My husband got the burger and it was really good. I had the tagliatelle and it was really bitter. The scallops appetizer and the her bread were both amazing. We didn't care for the boar served with little crostinis.  I'm going to stick with brunching here."}
{"text":"The Vandal is an eclectic and inviting spot that caters to vegetarians and carnivores alike.   It has a very trendy/hipster vibe but the staff is warm and inviting, making you feel very welcomed. I would absolutely recommend this little gem. Come check it out"}
{"text":"We had the green bean salad, two burgers with fries and the chicken sandwich. The burgers were really good, the chicken sandwich was fine, and the green bean salad was definitely disappointing. 

The portions aren't super big, but that's fine- you don't need much more. However, the green bean salad was an outlier: it was basically a few small leaves of lettuce with a few green beans, and the vinegar dressing was very strong, so beware.

The employees were very friendly, and the place was hip and trendy, but some of the things were slightly expensive for what you get. They just opened though, so the potential is there."}
{"text":"I always used to walk by the empty store front on Butler that is now The Vandal, and hope that someone would turn it into something great. Once I started to see construction going on inside, I was really happy to find out that it was going to be another exciting food option on Butler; not just another restaurant, but somewhere that offered breakfast, lunch, and dinner in a counter-service format for eat-in or take-out. Nothing against the typical take-out options, but sometimes you want to eat interesting, high-quality food AND watch Netflix at the same time, you know?

The menu is small but the options are varied enough that it was no problem finding something that sounded appealing. My friend and I both decided to try the burger (with marrow, pickles, cheese, tomato mayo, and greens). The meat was juicy and packed with flavor; the toppings added additional interesting flavors and textures while still allowed the meat to be the star. I am a huge fan of the tomato mayo. I thought this was a really interesting (and delicious) alternative to the traditional slab of tomato on top. I love pickles and was glad to see them included, and these did not disappoint. They were super thin and had a potent vinegary punch. I wish I could get these by the jar and put them on all of my sandwiches.

The burger came with a side of thin, crispy fries which we also enjoyed. There was no sauce served for dipping, but this was perfectly fine for us as they were flavorful on their own. My friend ordered a side of the mac and cheese (which I stole a few bites of). This was really interesting as the cheese sauce was thinner than your average mac, and the noodles were actually al dente. Mac and cheese is often a gelatinous blob of thick sauce and mushy noodles, so I loved that there were texture differences. The flavor was slightly sweet but the sea salt and chives on the top really rounded this out. They could serve a larger portion as an entree option--I would be into that.

Overall I'm excited to go back. I've seen pictures of some pretty tasty-looking breakfast items that I am excited to try. Seems like another great addition to Lawrenceville!"}
{"text":"Breakfast and Dinner is amazing here. The food is made completely from scratch and everything has tasted great. Service does take awhile due to kitchen size and the attention to detail of the dishes. I don't mind the wait since the food is so delicious and you can enjoy the company that you are with, instead of being rushed in and out, like some restaurants. I will be returning as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"This establishment purports to be a \"chill\" place suitable for \"hanging.\" I ordered a Chai Latte, and whilst waiting, since the restaurant was empty, sat down at a table assuming the seating was for cafe-goers as well. Unfortunately, but one vegetarian option was on the menu which I didn't find really appealing. After notifying the waitstaff of this, I was immediately received with a hostile mood for my lack of ordering an entree. This significant affected the preparation of my drink, to the extent that i was served boiled milk, garnished with hostility."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 3.5 stars because although I was super content with my meal (fried chicken sandwich with chili sauce), there could be a few improvements. I went with a friend for lunch and we both ordered the same meal, which came promptly.  The chairs are pretty uncomfortable, I'm personally picking and don't like being on metal chairs with no back support. Furthermore, its summer and the only form of cold air was coming from 1 solitary small fan put up on the counter. IT WAS SO HOT and the water wasn't even cold. Other than those complaints, the food was excellent and came in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Limited breakfast menu and waay overpriced.  $14 for a chicken and egg sandwich and $3 for a cup of regular coffee."}
{"text":"Every time I go to The Vandal I forget how inexcusably bad the service is.  The ambiance is wonderful and gives you the feeling you are not in Pittsburgh's regular haunts and the food is always good enough to make you forget that the staff are so insanely into themselves, seemingly above their jobs, and snotty. Our table was seated by the manager/owner (?) but was never assigned a server. After 15 minutes of trying to make eye contact politely and witnessing the staff just idling around, I had to approach a server who seemed insanely irritated that I had to ask for water and to be waited on. After he placed the initial order with absolutely no pleasantries or kindness or patience at all, another female server who I have experienced before continued waiting on us but with no kindness what-so-ever, I am not sure she even spoke to us, except to tell us where to pay. They forgot to bring a latte and we had to have it removed from our bill. After a handful of times at the Vandal in the last few years, I think I'm officially over it. Treating anyone like this in an establishment that survives on returning visitors and with a stuck-up-too-good-for-your-customers mentality, it's hard to warrant the cost of the meal."}
{"text":"Environmental and atmosphere: 5 Star. Simple but attractive.

Service: 2 Star. Very short handed. They did not even brought us glass while we have a bottle of water. We waited for 10 mins for the bill and we had to stand up looking for

Food: 4 Star. Looks gorgeous and taste good.

Price: 5 Star. Reasonable."}
{"text":"Dear Lord this place is good. Like really good. Like I want this in my life every day good. It's a simple menu of only a handful of choices, but I have no doubt every single item is delicious.

This is because my pork sandwich, with apple jam and a perfectly crisped kale chip on top was pure heaven. The side dish of green beans, ricotta, apple jam and egg was the perfect pairing. To top this off, I had the most delicious vanilla lemonade. 

One thing I will note is that this does not come cheap. The total was $22. Honestly, it was totally worth it. But if you're looking for a cheap lunch, this is not your place.

The decor is GORGEOUS too. It looks like that home decor magazine you subscribe to and want for your own. Exposed brick, herringbone hardwood floors, marble tables and exposed beams. 

That's it. I gotta go once a week to feed my craving!"}
{"text":"First time visitor for Sunday brunch. Had the chicken Sammy with egg and a side of greens. The greens were fresh and light. The chicken had a really nice flavor but was very overcooked ,kinda hard and tough to even cut. Other diner had the biscuit with egg and bacon. Biscuit was overcooked but the bacon and egg was very tasty. The coffee was tasty and the honey latte was very good. The only reason I'm giving a 3 star is because for the price of the dishes 14 and 10 dollars respectively I expect much better quality . The beignets with lemon sauce was very nice. 40 dollars for 2 for breakfast.  I'll try again but with go for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"If I lived in Pittsburgh, I would be a regular.  Trendy vibe.  Friendly and talkative staff.  Fresh ingredients.  Well executed dishes.  Rich and smooth coffee.  I couldn't have asked for more to start my Sunday morning.

In no particular orders, our dishes:

Fried chicken sandwich - On point.  One of the lighter fried chicken sandwiches I have eaten, which is a good thing.  Maybe too much of a good thing because I could have eaten three.  Juicy, delicate (yes, as delicate as a chicken sandwich could be), and balanced.  My only slight knock is the bun was a little firm, but all in all, 4.5 stars.

Eggplant and green beans - Well seasoned.  Savory and rich.  Hazelnuts are a nice touch.  4 stars.

Red skin potato hash - Not egg-ceptional (see what I did there), but well executed.  The hot+sweet peppers and confit onion were standouts.  Crisp presentation.  4 stars.

Coffee - As described above, rich and smooth.  Perfect.  5 stars.

Rice pudding - An excellent end to our meal.  Picturesque presentation.  Hazelnut adds a nice contrast in texture.  Coarse sea salt helps balance the dish and cut the sweetness.  4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Much has changed at The Vandal now that they've got their wings under them. Food quality has gone up enormously! Unfortunately so have the prices...but the food is worth it. They also serve coffee, at prices on par with the neighborhood."}
