{"text":"The owners must have changed since Katie has last reviewed this place, as it is now owned by the friendliest family I've ever met! I work very close to this location, so I stop by every once in a while even though Opa! itself is just okay. 

The man working the cashier is so very friendly and nice, and a very refreshing change from all the depressed cashiers at all the other fast food places.  He always thanks me for eating at Opa, and gives me little coupons that I could use for next time. 

I don't see too many people stopping by to eat here, even during the lunch hour and I hope this review would get them some more customers!"}
{"text":"When I went to the U of C, I basically became an Opa addict. Delicious souvlaki on cushy pita is a hard habit to kick, and every so often I'd get a craving for their crispy seasoned calamari. So I was a little put off when I ventured through the Plus 15s to this Opa, only to find out that they didn't have Calamari at that location. The lady at the till glared at me and rolled her eyes like I was stupid, and then got mad when I took my time deciding what I was going to have considering my first option was not allowed. Sorry I didn't look at the menu, but I KNOW the menu (or thought I did) already! 

I'll keep my habit to weekends and the pleasant service I've received at other locations. Opa is definitely worth some trouble, but in the future I'll go to the ones where they laugh and joke and appreciate their customers."}
{"text":"Opa tastes good. So I work right above this Opa and so at work we ordered Opa for the who crew who are all working on the stat holiday. I have to say the good old opa. Had the usual: Potatoe, Rice, Cesar Salad, Chicken and Lamb Skewer, Pita bread with tzatziki sauce. Eventhough this is food court food but it never disappoints me. 

I always enjoy food here. Good food."}
{"text":"I had my lunch today and after a huge Stampede breakfast, I decided on a small Greek Salad and eat my greens for the day.  I love Opa's Greek Salad and decided to try this location today.  

The small Greek Salad for $5.99 turned out to be quite a lot.  Good value for my money."}
