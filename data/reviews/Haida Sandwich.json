{"text":"Absolutely terrible. I paid almost $6 for an order of medium sized fries. When I took it out of the bag to eat I realized it was reheated old fries. They were so hard and chewy I had to throw it out after the second bite. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been coming here for years. The best sandwiches hands down. My favs are the pizza sandwich and turkey sandwich (hot). My next one I'm going to be trying is spicy chicken hot!! Had their pizza, nothing special, wouldn't get it again. Only annoying thing is they take forever to make it, so I suggest calling and pre ordering when your on your way so you don't have to wait there forever. Love it though! Portions are huge and quality is high."}
{"text":"The best sandwich I've ever had. They taste so different than everything I've tried before. I found out about this place last week.  I'm so addicted that I want to have it everyday . The sandwiches are huge and the price is cheap. The quality is great and everything is fresh. If you haven't tried it yet you are missing out big time. Try the pizza sandwich, haida pizza and haida special. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"It's a decent place to eat on the go - it gives you a craving maybe a week or two after you have it. The meat is sliced and stacked really (and I mean REALLY) generously. It's crazy how they don't skimp out on the meat. It's honestly a good inch-inch and a half thick of meat. They throw on some potato sticks in it too, and have a lot of mayo. The sandwich is probably only able to be eaten fully if you're drunk at 3am (it's open late) or haven't had anything to eat all day. Come for the sandwiches on those hungry late nights, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This establishment is a shameful example of a Persian eatery that shows zero disregard for customer satisfaction or customer service, I recommend avoiding this place to save your self the headache and continued disappointments.
I used to be a proud customer of Haida Sandwich and it's a shame that I must write this review since my attempts to come to a resolution with the owner of this store was met with immature insults and refusal to accept that maybe people do make mistakes and it's okay if we take steps to amend them however this was not the case.
I have attached pictures of the sandwich I  purchased to verify my claims and to put this review into perspective, the sandwich in the picture was sold to me for a total of $15 which is above the regular price of 10.99 for the Hot Beef Sandwhich, imagine my disappointment when I got home and opened the sandwich which I had paid $15 for green pepper, mushroom and extra cheese toppings and to see a former shelf of what used to be a Haida Sandwhich, not only all my toppings were charged and not added but even the regular toppings were cut off to save costs I guess? The top and bottom half of the sandwhich were just pure bread with maybe a pickle and two chips, extra cheese? More like light on cheese instead, so after coming home from work with a sandwhich to eat for lunch I had to quickly dress again drive back to the store with the abomination I was sold and request a new sandwhich to be made without any apologies or any attempts to make amends from the store.

The issue here is that you cannot expect any meaningful levels of customer service from this establishment, I like to have extra cheese, extra mushroom and peppers in my sandwiches, yes, it is offered by Haida Sandwhich yes I am more than willing to pay the cost of the toppings but it seems that Haida Sandwhich does not like honoring their own services and instead of accepting that an error was made the owner told me not ask for any more toppings on my sandwiches and if I want to order anything it better be the normal sandwiches because they don't serve toppings to anyone anymore so I asked him what about UberEats for options for extra cheese and tops are still available, his response? You must order from UberEats then not us! Are you serious? And of course he hangs the phone on me afterwards...

I work in the customer service industry and I know that sometimes customers can be unreasonable that's why I have been patiently trying to resolve this without any negative feedback but out right refusal of the owner to hear me out and accusing me of trying to scam for toppings has left me no choice but to follow up with this.

Owner claims out of 300 orders a day I am the only one yet when I was returning my sandwich a yonge lady and his daughter were at the counter and the cashier tells them \"sorry we forgot to add cheese to your fries we can refund you the cost\" ok!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are really big!  Be prepared to share one if you don't have a huge appetite.  Would recommend the Haida Sandwich or the Haida Pizza."}
{"text":"From the menu it states 12\" footlong sandwiches and was expecting the size to be somewhat similar to subway's 12\" footlong. But turned out very disappointed as the sandwich was very small and not even close to 12\".. more like 9\"sh 

Website Menus states the Pizza Sandwich comes with Potato Sticks in the sandwich.  (http://www.haidasandwich.ca/?product=pizza-sandwich)

Got take out, and realized half way when I was driving that there were ZERO potato sticks. I was really disappointed because I was craving to try a footlong sub stuffed with potato sticks lol 

I don't know if the `potato stick`is a typo on the menu website, but it clearly shows potato stick / Fries in the picture.. I will check again and re-edit this.    

2 stars for now......
 - the sandwich was smaller than advertised but was pretty good overall. 
 - took FOREVER to make.. 
 - poor service = wrong order."}
{"text":"There are bits and pieces of meat and vegetable in their special delicious sauce, but I always regret going there cause it takes nearly 30 minutes for an oven baked sandwich. And yes, their oven baked sandwich is a glimpse of heaven."}
{"text":"The pizza sauces on those pizzas are HEAVENLY!!! I mean, they could not have brought a better taste of persian pizza to their food  also DEFINITELY try their pomegranate juice because it does not differ from the one you get on vali-asr a bit. Whether you are persian or not, I think thieir pizzas and subs are so unique and well prepared. I have taken many of my american and canadian friends and they are obsessed!!!"}
{"text":"Visited on Monday evening for the first time.  Service was friendly,  ordered a pizza sub, guy said it would take 10-15 min.  Went back to my car which was parked in a no parking zone, because parking is really hard to get in that busy little area fyi. 
Came back in 15min and it was ready.  Portion size was great but the quality of meat isn't really worth the $10 with tax.  It was overflowing with a Persian sauce too which is ok, not that crazy about it.  Honestly for same price I rather get a prime rib or Angus sub from Quiznos. 
My Persian buddy said its more for expats from Iran because this is the type of fast food they get there, and they put ketchup on pizza.  It reminds them of home.
For non Persians I'd say try it once if you in the area, but there is definitely better options for a $10 sandwich."}
{"text":"Staff did not seem to know about the Groupon deal going on and dismissed my attempts to order while taking orders from her normal Persian customers. Finally she made a phone call and then said she can take my order now. She did not know how to scan the bar-code from her phone.. I admit I was a bit impatient at that point and asked to do it for her. Then finally when I ordered, I waited for at least 20 minutes before the sandwich was ready. 

I don't often lose my patience but they definitely provide friendlier and quicker service to customers of their own ethnic origin. She charged me $4 on top of my $12 voucher which did not make sense or was specified in the voucher, but she said that's what I need to pay. 

Aside from the slowest and most horrible service experienced, the sandwich is pretty good. The Pizza Sandwich and the Haida  Sandwich were large in portion and packed with meat. I'm a little torn about whether or not to return.. but I would have given them 4 stars if the service was as good as the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try these sandwiches after hearing so much about them from my Persian friends. Called in my order 25-30 minutes ahead of time but food wasn't ready when we got there. Sandwiches were great portions (large), super fresh and packed with tons of meat. Their house sauce on the sandwiches is a delicious sweet and tangy Mayo sauce. Overall a great experience minus the wait time."}
{"text":"I recently discovered this little shop that serves submarine sandwiches like no other I've ever had, although I admit I don't frequent Persian restaurants too frequently, but the ones I've been to don't serve up subs.

I had the Hot Beef Jambon sub, which was sliced processed beef, mayo,  crunchy pickles, tomato, and the ingredient that blew me away - hickory sticks, like the type made by Hostess that comes in a cellophane bag.  I really like the bread the sub came on; it was a little crusty on the outside but not so crusty that it hurt to eat. At $8.99 for a sub, at first I thought it was a bit expensive, but seeing that the beef was piled up over an inch thick and it took me two meals to finish it (I'm not a hefty eater though), I didn't mind the price too much.  The meat is nothing to write home about, it's just processed meat, but the hickory sticks, mayo, and bread really make the sandwich unique.

Decor-wise, this is more of a take-out joint, with a few counter seats only."}
{"text":"One of th best sandwich! The portion of the meat have been reduced to 1/2 in th sandwich! It shrinked!"}
{"text":"Not the best pizza, meats are processed and fatty tasting. Service is okay. Sandwiches are better than their pizza but a little bit too heavy on the sauces and mayo."}
{"text":"Great spot. Sandwich was amazing, the bread was extra crunchy. The corn was 5 stars too. Great experience."}
{"text":"Haida pizza is awesome! I give it a 4-star only because it took 20 min to prepare it which the lady informed us in advance."}
{"text":"A buddy of mine showed me this sandwich shop and since then I've become addicted.

This place is like Subway on steroids. Their sandwiches are massive and taste amazing. For $8.99, it's too good to be true.

I recommend getting:

*Haida Hot - remove the pickles, add romaine hearts and mushrooms.

*Haida Pizza

Me and my friends come here weekly and were always satisfied with the food.

Don't forget to get a points card ($1 for every $20 you spend). If you're going to frequent this place then it's recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Got the Haida hot sandwich and a pizza. 

The pizza was amazing, it reminded me of the awesome pizza I had back in Iran. If this is the first time you've had Iranian style pizza, you're in for a unique experience. 

The sandwich was also great. It was toasted and and the bun was nicely toasted, just the right amount of crisp.

The portions are huge! The personal size pizza or the sandwich will be more than enough for one person. I'll definitely by dropping by more often."}
{"text":"Just came here to grab a quick bite or so I thought, read through some previous reviews and thought the wait on the food was because this place was extremely busy...unfortunately I was wrong and such simple contraptions like a sandwich for some reason takes like 45mins. The place is not the biggest and probably can seat like 8 people but it mostly looks like it's designed for takeout. I had order the pizza sandwich and...sadly enough I felt like I wasted my time and money (time is money on that note)  the sandwich itself was honestly nothing special and felt like a lunchable in a submarine form. The meat was bland and overpowered by the ketchup sauce, the hickory sticks were pointless as the sauce made then soggy. Overall while digesting...physically and mentally why people would come here (maybe cuz it's halal?)..I myself will be skipping this place as Subways taste better than they do and they prepare it a lot faster. I don't think there's anything significant that might be made in house, but by the taste of the bread I can probably assume the wait is long because the bread itself is frozen. I witness another customer that recieved thier fries and again unfortunately it was so bad that they demanded a refund, from what I can see the fries are apparently baked....but they were not crispy at all and looked limped and soggy...that's gross. The only plus side to this place is the cashier was sort of friendly and welcoming face to see....but honestly I came here to eat, and that I did, and that I won't be returning. Nothing Gourmet about this place to be waiting around for 30mins+ honestly please listen to the reviews and don't bother wasting your time here.

Will I Repeat? NO FREAKING WAY"}
{"text":"Worst sandwich i ever had, nothing look like before, quality was very poor.
We order sandwiches and a pizza none of us ate our food so basically 65 dollars damage didnt make us full. plus we order mexican corn i think if we had corn from can would taste better with little bit of butter,salt and lime juice another 12 dollar went to garbage. 
I been ordering my sandwich without tomato not once came without tomato so dont bother tell them what you want.
Customer service (1/10) called the owner and explained what happend last night, respond \"was a busy night they shouldnt take orders\"
So go figure.
Debit machine wasnt working they said telephone line is out but how come you took our order on the phone. More cash money less taxes they have to pay , they do that on busy nights."}
{"text":"Purely based on taste, very good! This is a take away place so don't expect customer service. Would have given five had the inside of the restaurant been cleaner."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches in Toronto.
They make their own sauce (Signature Sauce)
This was my favourite deli sandwich backhome (Iran)"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of great things about this place but never convinced myself to step in when there is so much selection in the area. Finally, today was the day I would try one of these sandwiches. The cashiers who took my order were very nice and took the time to tell me the popular sandwiches. I chose the Pizza Sandwich which is similar to other \"sub\" like sandwiches but mixed and sauces together. First thing I noticed when I received my sandwich is how heavy it was, which could only mean it is packed with ingredients. With the first bite, tho it didn't look like a pizza, it sure tasted like a juicy pizza. I also enjoyed the potato sticks which brought me back to a bag of hickory sticks. I wondered if I could finish the hefty sandwich only to realize I could hardly finish half!
In the future, I might try another less saucy sandwich and most likely find someone to share it with."}
{"text":"A friend recommended I try this place and was raving about it so I thought I'd give it a shot... Imagine my disappointment when I thought I was going to a Persian sandwich shop and ended up getting what reminded me of a deli sandwich... I thought I would try their Haida sandwich since apparently it was their specialty. Sadly I was left a little disappointed. 
Don't get me wrong, it's not a terrible sandwich, but it's also not the best one that I've ever had in my entire life. 

Do I have high standards? Maybe. Am I upset about it? Not really.

On the plus side, they're definitely not stingy on the toppings or on the meat, and the sauce was actually pretty delicious. It just wasn't what I was expecting.

All in all 3 stars and I probably won't go back, but if you like your sandwiches with some sliced salami type meat then give it a whirl!"}
{"text":"Mmmm the potato chip beef sandwich is delish!!! Sandwiches are HUGE!!! Split between 2 ppl and it's perfect!!! Love it here!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Open very late. Very small place so should be used for take out only. Ask the sandwiches are good, but some are cold and some are hot, temperature-wise. Good large portions. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Small little sandwich shop inside Northtown Way! Mostly take-out service but has a few stools and counters for a quick lunch.

$10.99 for a foot long chicken sandwich on white or whole wheat bread.

The chicken was made fresh and tasted slow-cooked, juicy, and tender. It's diced up and tossed in ample house mayo sauce. Served with lots of coriander and pickles slices...

Pretty big portion! Definitely beats Subway's and Quizno's foot long chicken sandwich in size and quality.

Deserves the 3.5 star rating on Yelp.

Order ahead of time!!!! Sandwich took 30 minutes to make!!"}
{"text":"BEST.SANDWICHES.EVER

The Veggie Pizza Sandwich (or pizza sandwich if you're not a vegetarian like me) is to DIE FOR. Like every sandwich and pizza is actually the best thing i've ever had. I go there once a week and munch out :) 

5/5 stars"}
{"text":"- One of my favorite cheat day spots especially since its open late.
- Price to quantity is favorable. Most sandwiches are enough for two meals.
- Hot Haida sandwich is a popular choice. Signature sauce, processed meat, hickory sticks and that bread. Perfect. 
- Takes around 15 minutes for a sandwich to be made. Would recommend calling ahead of time if you know your order.
- Try out the Haida pizza and pomegranate juice as well."}
{"text":"Walked into the place around 11 o'clock. One gentleman was sitting I think waiting for a food. I stood there for 15 mins. No one came out of the back to greet me, didn't want to wait for food. Based on service alone I give the place one star."}
{"text":"Hot turkey sandwich is amazing. I always call in my order in advance so it's ready when I arrive. Love the sauce and hickory sticks. Not sure about the quality of meat, but it tastes great and is loaded on. Sandwiches are huge, can only eat half at a time (but is a great treat later on). Don't usually like pickles on my sangy, but this time it just works. Anyone saying Subway is better is nuts. Also a super hangover cure! Service has always been pleasant, though English not always widely understood."}
{"text":"They take way too long to make a \"tanoori sandwich\" which translates into oven baked sandwich. You can either sit at the tiny counter and watch Persian pop music on the screen or sit in your car and come back in 10-20 mins. I honestly don't know what's in the jambon or where they're made. When you read something like 70% meat, it really means there's also spleen, kidney, fat, and other non-meat products all mashed up together to make the \"meat slices\". How healthy is a jumbo sandwich filled with hickory sticks, tons of mayo and mysteriously made jambon in white bread? It's absolutely not healthy. Does it taste good? hell yeah! I have tried their pizza and Mexican corn as well. They both taste delicious, especially the pizza. They also have a drink called \"Istak\" which gained some popularity amongst the Persian fast food restaurants in Toronto. The pomegranate, tropical and lemon flavours are delicious."}
{"text":"I can see a lot of negative reviews on this place but I have been here three times now and have had a positive experience. I mostly come here during specific hours when they aren't too busy so I don't feel rushed or crowded in if I'm eating there. Their hot sandwiches are delicious, I especially love the hickory sticks and house mayo sauce. I always order the Haida Hot that comes with your daily processed beef but the sandwich itself is filled with a lot of secondary flavors which hit the spot. If you aren't feeling the sandwich then you can order pizza or even appetizers, I tend to get the Mexican corn if I'm passing by and happen to be a tad hungry. 
I haven't really asked the staff to prepare a special order for me so I can't really speak on their level of service. But I'm not picky at all, so even if they forget to do something I have requested I don't even notice it myself (sadly). Therefore, it really isn't my place to negatively speak on their service because I just go in, get my sandwich, eat it, and leave satisfied.
I do recommend this place for late night cravings because it is open late and it definitely does hit the spot. Some orders take some time to prepare so calling in to place your order is a good idea."}
{"text":"Still garbage can't believe how awful it is . What a waste of time and money. Disappointed!"}
{"text":"It doesn't have comfortable and friendly environment. You were asked repeatedly if you have paid or not. It look long time to get your \"fast food\". If you want to get good sandwich with good price,that is place. But it's pizzas are too pricy with respect to quality  and content. Service is proper."}
