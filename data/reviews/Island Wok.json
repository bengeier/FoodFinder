{"text":"Get the jerk pork or general tso.   Food is great.   Very friendly.   Love this place"}
{"text":"A new place that I decided to check out. Got the jerk chicken and jerk pork and wasn't disappointed. The chicken was amazingly seasoned, had a nice spice to it, chicken was tender and juicy, wasn't bland at all. The pork was just as good of an experience. Well seasoned with the same spices, tender and had a nice fat content. It wasn't dry at all. Can't wait to come back on another visit! 

The store looked pristine, a very clean look and things came out in a timely manner. Just the kind of place to go for a quick lunch or when you're too lazy to cook at night (quite often for me). Fast, simple, delicious. What more can you want?"}
{"text":"I used to order from island wok at least twice a month and the food was always good. I ordered from them tonight and what a different experience !!! 
I ordered a CHICKEN Low mein and a garlic broccoli . When I came home and opened my phone it was a shrimp noodle dish ( I have a seafood allergy so this was useless to me) and the garlic broccoli was swimming in water with no taste . When I called the store I was told that I would have to bring the order back the to store and they would try and fix it for me. Horrible food and Horrible SERVICE !! Very Disappointed. Will be looking for another Friday night dinner spot."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the food here. Love the chicken dishes they are actually good pieces of breaded chicken with white meat. Really good and not overly battered. 
Jerk chicken is good, fried rice is tasty. 

Try them out!"}
{"text":"Amazing prices for great food. 
Quick fast and easy service. I ordered the house chicken on fried rice and I was happily surprised at how large their portions are. The food tastes amazing and I'll definitely be coming back for more. I encourage all to give this new spot a shot!"}
{"text":"Recently discovered this place and really happy I tried it. I absolutely love their jerk pork with noodles. The pork is so well cooked and they don't skimp out on the amount they give you. The jerk seasoning isn't too spicy or salty. Would like less bone on the house and jerk chicken but still good."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed virtually everything from my order here. I think I ordered: chicken fried rice, beef and broccoli, jerk chicken on chow mein, and chicken wings.

I can't say that it was necessarily healthy, but I found it was less greasy than many other fast-food Chinese takeout places. I believe the place is run by Chinese-Guyanese people. The jerk chicken itself was fairly average, but I can say that it works perfectly well IMO with chow mein.

Super clean inside, with nice modern decor. and quite a bit of seating if you wish to dine in. A bit pricier than other comparable places - though the quality is better to be fair."}
{"text":"Really great food, one thing I loved was it wasn't too greasy unlike other takeout restaurants, and the jerk chicken tastes like if you were to make it yourself at home which is great (you know it's real ingredients being used). Overall, I've recommended to my family and will return, especially since customer service is good too!"}
{"text":"Looking for something different then look no further.  Chinese/Caribbean food under the same roof and NOT in a food court.  What a dream come true.  Did a search on Yelp for jerk pork in Brampton and I was surprised that Island Wok showed up in my search.  Being so close to my house I had to try it.  I ordered the jerk pork on top of chow mein.  Let me tell you there was an explosion of taste in my mouth.  Picture going to a Jamaican place and getting some jerk pork and then going to pick up some chow mein at a Chinese restaurant then when you get home you mix them together.  The only difference is you only have to go to Island Wok to get this.  The flavors were outstanding.  Looking for Chinese food this is the place to be.  Looking for Caribbean food then look no further.  Island Wok I will be seeing you very often."}
{"text":"This place is good!! The food is fresh and the combinations, amazing. We ordered the jerk chicken lo mein, chicken lo mein, and the chicken wontons. AMAZING! Great service. Clean space. We'd definitely return in the future. 

It's located in a strip mall with other stores and restaurants. It's not a large location but large enough. There is a bathroom available for patrons which is nice. 

Stop in some time."}
{"text":"Pretty good carribean-chinese fusion dishes in Brampton. The jerk chicken on friend rice is something you should definitely want to try."}
{"text":"Good delicious meal with good size portion, nice clean place so it's not a bad place to stop by for lunch every now and then or when I'm the neighborhood."}
{"text":"While I can appreciate the mix of carribean and Chinese dishes I wouldn't really consider this a fusion spot. It's more of a Chinese restaurant that happens to serve jerk chicken and pork. Portions were large and prices were decent so I have no complaints on that end. The food was also good and the service was provided with a smile 
It's a smaller place that is very popular for takeout so be sure to keep that in mind and order ahead. 

Overall I can't really complain, just make sure to go in expecting a mostly Chinese focused experience"}
{"text":"Stopped by after gym, first time trying it and it was good the chicken wasn't dry or over cooked like other places. I had there fried rice and sweet and sour chicken lunch special."}
{"text":"Recently discovered this place and really happy I tried it. I absolutely love their jerk pork with noodles. The pork is so well cooked and they don't skimp out on the amount they give you. Their portion sizes are large which is awesome for leftovers.
The jerk seasoning isn't too spicy or salty. Would like less bone on the house and jerk chicken but still good."}
{"text":"So a little restaurant in the middle of a bunch of other restaurants. The one person taking orders in the front looked so disinterested. No changes or subsitutions. Fine. No worries I can handle that. You have a seating area and when asked for water I got an excuse that they are out of cups. Are you kidding me? If you just want me to pay for a bottle, don't play. 

Then the food. The wonton soup seemed quite nice. Clear broth, fresh veggies. Not bad at all. The rest though. The Caribbean chicken rice had almost no chicken with no real Caribbean flavor and oh so dry. The Lo.Mein tasted better, but simply cuz it was dripping in oil. 

That was a lot of oil. The sweet an sour chicken meatballs were previously frozen and fried, cold centre, way too much batter and tasteless interior. Dollar store sauce next to it. Lastly the egg rolls. Fried to the nines, terrible sauce and really weird interior. I don't even know what was in them. 

That was a terrible experience. Not to be repeated."}
{"text":"First time here, and went based on previous reviews. As soon as I walked in, the place smelt amazing, probably more so because I was hungry. It is a small restaurant but they made good use of the space to sit and wait or hang with friends and fam.  

I ordered the pepper shrimp combination for one, which came with chicken fried rice ($1.50 extra which I didn't ask for, but understand the confusion from my daughter's order) and a spring roll. 

The spring roll didn't taste great, it had a \"cooking in old oil\" taste to it, but the sweet and sour sauce almost masked it. I found the chicken fried rice to be bland, had to mix it with hot sauce, plum sauce, and sweet and sour sauce for some more flavour. However.....  The pepper shrimp was up my alley. Loved it! This reason gave this restaurant a 4 stars in my book. 

Would eat here again, but I'm more cautious of what to get and to watch my bill for orders that were not made."}
{"text":"The interior is very nice, the food is okay, but the man who works at the cashier has an attitude and seems to be very rude."}
{"text":"Visited this place & was really impressed at their interior the moment I got in. Really clean, and modern. 

We got lunch specials.
1) jerk chicken on fried rice
2) lemon chicken on fried rice

Jerk chicken? I expect more flavour.
Lemon chicken? Not so much serving compared to the jerk chicken :(

But the rice was good. and how can I complain with the price? Will try some other item when I get back.

tip: You pay as you order. So that's nice!"}
{"text":"Being new to the neighborhood I've been looking around trying to find new places to eat that are close by.  I spotted island wok and decided to give it a try. I absolutely love Chinese Caribbean food so I had high hopes for this place. It is definitely one of the nicest Caribbean Chinese joint I have been to. Most of them look like holes in the wall but they make the best food. This one was very modern, clean, and had a vivid menu posted on the wall with attractive pictures. I ordered the pepper shrimp, house fried rice and jerk chicken. The food was good but it wasn't the best I've had. Because I eat this type of food so often I have other to compare it to and that's why I said it was good but not the best. If this was my first time trying it I would say it was great because it is a nice twist on traditional Chinese food. They have a pretty extensive menu so I will definitely come back to try other items and update if anything knocks my socks off. Tip: ask for the home made hot sauce!

Update: came back and ordered the Chinese broccoli and house chicken on white rice. So satisfying! The broccoli was crisp and garlicky. The house chicken is a Guyanese style fried chicken (way less batter) that I prefer over regular fried chicken. I'd also like to make a note that they saw me filling my car with windshield fluid and  offered to come outside and do it in the winter. That kind of customer service can't be bought. Thanks Lawrence! Look forward to trying more things on the menu"}
{"text":"This is a good local spot. I typically go here for their lunch combos, sweet and sour chicken on fried rice to be specific. But! I've tried other things on their menu and I'm never disappointed. Quick little Chinese Caribbean spot, with a nice clean eat in area if you want to sit in. The lunch combos are a good deal, but they also have them available as single combinations after their lunch special hours."}
{"text":"Good service, clean place, decent tasting food, the chicken on rice tastes just like the island. You are basically getting a lot of rice, even in the entres they put rice below the meat so it looks like its a lot of meat but its actually a whole lot of rice for 10 plus tax = 12 bucks."}
