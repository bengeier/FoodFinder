{"text":"I ordered the posted daily special - schnitzel on a bun. While it was supposedly made fresh, it took 20+ minutes before it was served. The bun was nicely toasted but there was ketchup and mustard on the schnitzel! I didn't request these odd toppings but didn't want to take another 20 minutes to a replacement as our friends had already finished their lunches."}
{"text":"What a great find! this place serves up great Austrian fare at a reasonable price, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Thanks Will for the friendly service and delicious food!! My friends and I enjoyed lunch today, including Sausage on a Bun (with Sauerkraut, of course), Schnitzel with Potato Salad, and the Spatzle Frittata. Oh, and a \"Summer Breeze\" or two.... ;)

I would definitely recommend this place if you live or work locally, or like me, combined it with a walk through nearby Colonel Samuel Smith Park."}
{"text":"Wow, the food here is REALLY good. I tried the bonfire breakfast,  a mountain of artery clogging goodness on a plate, and thoroughly enjoyed every bite. The café itself is lovely and very clean. The staff are friendly and welcoming; it really felt like being a guest in someone's home. There isn't full table service,  you order and pay at the counter, then seat yourself and the meals are brought to your table. The service is definitely slow, I feel like if they had one more person working it would be perfect. Fortunately I had good company and nowhere else to be all day so the wait wasn't so bad. So happy to have this great new brunch spot in the hood."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this little gem. Dishes are made fresh and the owner takes pride in serving his customers authentic freshly made Austrian recipes. 

What I consider to be the winner of the menu is the Winter punch. It is a hot mulled wine cooked wirh seasonal winter fruit and spices, well balanced wothout over powering each other. There is no better drink you can choose on a cold winter day. I paired it with a strawberry Palatschinken (crepe) with proper whip cream (not the one from a can). It was simply heavenly!"}
{"text":"Went in as I biked past it before ; it seemed like the perfect place to do work.  The interior is pretty spacious and has lots of light- 
The owner mans the kitchen and front and was quite accommodating to someone who couldn't make up her mind, I had the special of the day as he recommended it-
It was tenderloin with maple crusted potatoes with some beans and came with some melon - quite refreshing! 
I am not a fan of potatoes but I loved these,  the maple crust made it very unique and the texture was crunchy then firm into the potatoes - the tenderloin came in 4 pieces and was seasoned well not too overpowering and not too bland. 
It took less than 15 minutes for my order to arrive and it was quite hot- no shortcuts here! 

Will be back for desserts and more food!  
The owner is really really nice and knows his stuff-"}
{"text":"Glad to welcome another food option to the Lake shore area.  Had the Bondfire & Crapes.  Awesome presentation on both.  Decent feed on the Bondfire, I realize that is the way it is meant to be but could have really used another egg!  I have to report we did have an issue with the one meal but it was quickly rectified and apologies offered so that was all good.  Time will tell how the pricepoint stands up to other offerings in the area!"}
{"text":"I thought I had reviewed this place but I didn't and I'm glad somebody posted a thread in Yelp Talk asking which places deserve more love.  In searching for this place in order to link it to my response I had realized that I in fact did not review Sugar for My Honey and that doesn't happen very often where I will actually go to a place and forget to review it.

It was about a month ago that I had come to this restaurant with my wife to have dinner.  The place is sort of a cafe and they have a variety of different coffee, tea but also has a variety of Austrian/German dishes.

The menu is sort of confusing in that the first items listed are palatshinken which are (because I had to ask) a sort of crepe.  Some are served with savory filling and some can also be ordered with fruit and other sweet fillings such as for dessert (banana, apples, strawberries).

There are sandwiches, schnitzels and brunch is served here as well.  I had ordered the schnitzel which came with a side of cold potato salad.  My wife went with a special called the Farmer's Feast which included sausage, ham, meatloaf wrapped in bacon, potatoes and sauerkraut.

The food was very good and we stayed for some drinks as well.  There was a special called Winter punch which was a warm apple/cranberry spices orange and lemon.  This was a very nice drink to have on a cool day.  My wife ordered a latte and we decided we'd also get an order of strawberry palatshinken which we shared for dessert.  

I noticed they had spatzle which I had only once before and it was really good.  Perhaps I'll get that as a side next time.

Being that they have a brunch, and have some European dishes this place is a nice change from your everyday fare.  The schnitzel was amazing and it's something I don't get very often but I can see it being my new favorite thing to have here."}
{"text":"Took one hour to get our meal. This is ridiculous. Won't be coming here any time soon."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

The place I usually go to was swarming with students (from the nearby college and junior school) and I was with my 4 month old in her stroller. They caught my attention by placing a picture of Wiener/Vienna schnitzel with potato salad as Today's special. They had just opened in June of this year.

The place was pretty empty (two elderly ladies brunching and another lady reading at the window seat) though it was a Friday around noon. 

The girl at the front was brand new and she was very nice. She asked if i wanted ham, eggs, mushrooms or various other things to add onto my meal. I opted for mushrooms. 

The total came up to $17 and I didnt even order a drink (just water). 

Apparently the lovely new girl rang something in wrong so the owner (in a blue sugar for my honey t-shirt) came over to apologize and explain that she charged me the wrong price and that it was $2 more then I had originally paid. 
I noticed then that the mushrooms were a $2 charge. The owner seemed greatly confused that I wanted mushrooms on my schnitzel and asked me had I ever had real Austrian schnitzel before? Anyways, we just agreed to leave off the mushrooms to make up for the error. 

While I was waiting I was entertaining my daughter on my lap and the waitress came over to compliment her. Again, such a lovely girl but she stood there hovering way too long that it became very awkward, also she was pretty much launching into her entire life story. I possibly misled her by talking as well but I noticed she launched into it with another customer as well. 
Keep doing what you are doing but coming from a person who has waited for many years, try to tone it down a little. 

My daughter started to get a little fussy and hungry so I opted to take it go and they were very accommodating.

The schnitzel was delicious, a tad salty but I enjoyed it (wouldve been nice with some pan fried mushrooms on top but i digress) and it was the size of a large dinner plate cut into three pieces to fit into the container. Quite thin though... pounded out to an inch of its life. 

The potato salad was tasty, not quite creamy. I enjoyed it and I am not the biggest fan of potato salad. The rest of the menu was very interesting, looked yummy though a tad overwhelming. 

All in all for a \"special\" it was very pricey but beyond that I hope that they do well. It is the kind of quaint, hip place that lakeshore/ long branch village needs."}
{"text":"This still-new cafe is an awesome place to sample German and Austrian drinks and listen to live jazz jam, performed by Humber College students. I'm impressed by the owner's hospitality and the fact that he keeps his hard liquor in the freezer (just like I do at home), which really highlights the flavour.
Great place for brunch and dinner or just coffee and desserts."}
{"text":"So good! Great find in the neighborhood. Not the fastest place to get a meal, but that's only because they literally make the whole thing when you order it. Nothing worth getting fussed about, if you know that going in. 

So fresh, so tasty, great vegetarian variety, and amazing desserts. The staff are also super nice the place is spotless, and it's a nice cozy place to hang out for a bit. We had the German pasta, some salad, and veggie shepherds pie. All super tasty. Will return for those and more. 

And if you're bothered about authenticity, I'd say from my time in Germany and Austria, this place is pretty on point."}
{"text":"***3.5* for Ice Cream Crepe/Coffee, I'm sure my rating will be either be a solid 4 or even 5 upon my next visit***

After grabbing some dinner at Thrive, I decided to stop by this place for dessert.

Décor is clean and Scandinavian-inspired...err, maybe I'd say Ikea.  In any event, it is modern, uncluttered, and minimalist.

I ordered a crepe with Vanilla Ice Cream & Chocolate Sauce ($10.99) and an Americano.  Crepe was alright, a bit cold, probably pre-made, so I'd probably recommend trying something that is warm so you can get a better idea of the true texture of a crepe.  (Another indication that crepe was pre-made was the fact that it arrived at our table shortly after ordering.)  Portion was quite generous, the size of my forearm, & totally shareable!  Americano was ok.

I'd definitely be open to going back to try their brunch/dinner menu/warm crepes 'cause the photos and other reviews do sound good!"}
{"text":"Visited here in June on a Sunday and loved it. Had the night owl grilled sandwich, very fresh and tasty. My friend had the apple crepes and they were perfect, not too sweet. Coffee was fantastic, so good I bought some to bring home. Service was very good. Wish I lived closer so I could visit more often."}
{"text":"Yey a new delicious brunch place! 

Atmosphere: lovely. Good music. Well decorated. Place was clean. Feels like a patio with the doors open and sun shining in.

Service: quite new. Food took a bit longer than the usual time it would take at the chain brunch places like coras but same time as other local like goodlake or huevos. The owners are really friendly. Nice type of welcoming friendly and not the fake overly friendly kind so that was nice. 

Food: Fantastic. Would definitely come back. Hubby had the ham and mushroom crepes. I had the bonfire. Delicious but couldnt finish everything. They gave a load of sausages. The potatoes wedges are crispy and yummy. Other places give more fries than sausage but this place was generous. Although next time I will ask for more fries and less sausage. Had the iced coffee. Really good! Kind of reminds me of Vietnamese ice coffee. I would do walk ins for their coffee alone. Surprisingly better than starbucks. 

Price: cheap and cheerful. 

Definitely would recommend! Although not sure about the sign...it doesnt pop so we didnt notice it until now as we go to Dani Sushi nearby all the time."}
