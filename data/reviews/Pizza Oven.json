{"text":"Came in hopeful and with an open mind. Nothing special about the place itself, just an above-ground basement. The server was very friendly. We ordered a medium Pyramid pizza which is like their special.  Nothing special about this za. It was mediocre, but we shook it off and thought \"well, we tried it.\" Then we got the bill and found out it was more than $25. In my disbelief I looked at the menu, only to find the specialty za prices aren't listed.   Then it occurred to me I could have had a pie from Salvatore's for that money."}
{"text":"Awful service, food fine. Waited 45 minutes for a single pizza (wen we arrived, we were the only table) while dining in, server was actively hostile and rude. Pizza, when it arrived, was fine, but nothing worth enduring the service for."}
{"text":"I was shocked to see the rating for the Pizza Oven. My family and I have been coming to the various locations for over for 20 years and have always enjoyed the food they provide. I wished their delivery radius expanded slightly out of Monona, but I still enjoy carrying out and dining in.   I love the addition of the \"Sauce Bar\" and the neighborhood environment that they create. They often do a pizza buffet for lunch, which is wonderful. VINTAGE ARCADE GAMES TOO!!! Perfect place to come have a relaxed meal, a drink and a game of pinball! ($100 for 4 pizzas, 3 orders of bread sticks, AND $20 in quarters makes me wish I had children)"}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Nice place for entertainment and a sit down meal. The large pizza is very big, feeds 5-7 easily!"}
{"text":"Good pizza buffet and salad bar. Been coming here for years. Cinnamon breadsticks!"}
{"text":"Love it! A dive bar of sorts with great pizza. Wish there was one closer to Middleton!"}
{"text":"Three stars as the pizza is very good and nostalgic for many of us.  The recipe has not changed in forever and that is good thing.  Cracker thin pizza with plenty of cheesy greasy wonderful-ness.  It does pain me to say my last delivery took over an hour and half to get delivered.  It was pretty hard to defend to a house of hungry people that it was going to be worth it.  Next time I guess I will have to come get carry out?  But the big of appeal of pizza in so many ways is the delivery factor.  Perhaps it was just an off night (it was a Saturday with a Badger game on) but it was delivered a full half hour after the quoted delivery time."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is tasty with many different pizza topping options... boneless wings, lasagna, salad bar... Worth $8"}
{"text":"Great pizza place to eat in or for takeout. I go here every other week, I'm a thin crust lover and they have the best thin crust around."}
{"text":"The new location, which includes servers and a nice bar area, is a huge improvement. The pizza is quite possibly my favorite in the Madison area."}
{"text":"I'll have to come back and try the pizza.  I came at 6:30 on a weeknight and the place was pretty empty, with the exception of the bar.  The one waitress, was polite and prompt, but she seemed to be the only person working.    As for the food- the fries were really good, the toppings on them were not.  The wings, I would eat again, but they were a bit small and the sirachi bourbon are very very sweet."}
{"text":"Used to be our go-to pizza place, but the last two pizzas have been bad.  I don't know if they changed their sauce, ingredients or what, but there was no flavor.  Very little sauce.  Icky.  We'll try them again one more time because it used to be good, but if cardboard with cheese arrives again, we'll try others.  Moved up to four stars.  We tried it again and were pleased to find out they have improved back to the good pizza they used to be!"}
{"text":"Had Pizza Oven pizza for the first time, and I have to say it was great! Crispy crust, carmelized cheese on top. Nice dusting of flour. I had the cheese (I know, I know - plain jane) and it was spot on. I've tried a few pizza spots in Madison so far, and Pizza Oven is my favorite yet! Also, family owned, which is great to see :)"}
{"text":"We have been here on a couple occasions for kid group events.  We were in the back room with the arcade for both events so I cannot speak to what sitting in the front is like.    My kids and their friends had a blast and ran through quarters really quickly between all of the parents.  The back room is kind of noisy with all of the games but that should be expected.  Their breadsticks are awesome my husband said, we both had pizza as well but it was just so so.  Service was pretty good, they were making sure everyone was taken care of.    Good place to take kids and their friends to hang out but probably not some place my husband and I would go for date night."}
{"text":"We ordered from the Pizza Oven the other night to celebrate my wife's birthday.  We called in and ordered carry-out, since we were spending the night at home.  The Pizza Oven is a little pricier than other pizza places in the neighborhood, but this is a special occasion and we have been meaning to try it for a while.  We ordered the Pyramid specialty pizza and deep-fried mushrooms, and the total was more than we had expected.  This already set the place at a disadvantage; the pizza could be the best we would ever taste, but the price would be something not easily overlooked.   Anyways, I arrived at the location to pick up our order.  I stood at the hostess station for what had to be 5 minutes without being noticed.  Then, I went to the bar to tell the bartender I was there to pick up a carry-out order.  She was very kind and helpful when I was able to get her attention.  When I got home, the food was decent.  The deep-friend mushrooms were flavorful and delicious.  Not watery at all, which is probably the first time I have ever been able to make that statement.  The pizza was a good thin crust and not slimy, from what I have come to expect at other establishments.   If you want to try something different and are not concerned about price, I recommend the Pizza Oven.  Otherwise, stick to a national or local chain where you can be confident in what you are paying for."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried the newly relocated Pizza Oven because we wanted a salad bar, and Copps is the only other place we could think of in Monona (sooo sad). The salad bar at Pizza Oven is part of the pizza buffet (well, next to it, but you know the drill: it's a pizza buffet with a salad bar). The mixed greens lettuce was very fresh. There are a dozen or so toppings and maybe 5 dressings. The veggies were all good. (We're vegetarians, and so cannot speak for the meat toppings, of which there were several.)  My wife loved the breadsticks. I thought the mac & cheese (large elbow macaroni style) was very good. Almost all of the pizza had meat toppings, which is ubiquitous in Wisconsin (and elsewhere). We met the owner, and he was very nice. I didn't think the cheese-only pizza was great, but that wasn't why I went.  I liked it enough that I tried it again today, 3 days later. There was a plain cheese pizza out, and the waiter offered to make another veggie pizza if I wanted. I said that was OK--I would just try the cheese pizza. It was good--much better than the other day. I'm not a fan of cutting a pizza in squares (in squares?), but there you have it. The pizza in the middle is the best (which you can't eat without squishing your fingers in the cheese, as it's inexplicably cut into squares), but there you go. (Rossi's also cuts their pizza in squares. Is this some sort of twisted, Monona joke? Is this how Germans make pizza?)  If you like pizza + salad bar, and you're in Monona, this is your only choice. But it's a good choice. If you want something special, ask. They seem friendly and accommodating, and the next time I want salad bar, I'm going. And I may take them up on making a veggie pizza to put out. (Copps actually has the best salad bar in the area, but it's a grocery store, not a restaurant.) Anyway, Pizza Oven. Recommended."}
{"text":"I like pizza but this is not what I expected.  Many years ago this was a Monona institution with great thin crust pizza cut into squares. Now it's thin crust has the taste of chalk and toppings are tiny and the sauce has gone towards ketchup. Terrible I'm very sorry to say. Nice bar area but it's not the Pizza Oven of old."}
{"text":"Definitely decent! I wish I could give 3.5 stars here, the pizza is always good, and a good price, and I agree with Arthur S, the atmosphere is friendly, the service is always good. (I guess I'm a pizza snob, and I wish they had a few weird ingredients, or a more exciting crust or something, but it hits the mark as a quality family pizza joint) The full bar is a bonus too, and add that to the kid-friendly factor (game room where the games actually work, not too quiet or too loud) the availability of local brand ice cream (yum!) and the fact that they sponsor lots of local teams makes for a winning combo. Clean bathrooms & an affordable pizza & salad bar at lunchtime too, a great addition to the local landscape. (The pizza bar does feature some of the more unusual topping combos that they do have, which is fun, trying different weird but good combos) Consistently tasty & always friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered mac n cheese and cheesebread for carryout.   I expected better.    The mac n cheese was \"ok.\"  The cheesebread was average.  Fries came with the mac n cheese which I thought was odd.  The fries, though too salty, were actually the best of the carryout.  Maybe pizza would've been a better choice."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their shrimp pizza but unfortunately it seems to be hit or miss. Either I get the amazing pizza I came in for or I get a burnt pizza I wish I had not picked up. Thankfully the times I get a bad pizza seem to be not as often as a good pizza. The shrimp pizza is unlike any other in town and I will keep going there no matter what for it."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best places in Madison for Chicago-style (or something close to Chicago-style) thin crust pizza. I got mine for carryout, but it's also the kind of pizza that'd be good in the Sauce Bar next door after a couple beers."}
{"text":"Update: Went here on a busy Friday night and there were a million little kids running around. If you have little kids, or you like that sort of thing, have at it- but that's not my bag. Also, the place smelled weirdly like cat pee where you walk in. I still like the pizza from this place but am turned off by all of the screaming kids."}
{"text":"Traditional thin crust locally owned pizza place. Pizza can be really good or miss the mark. Very hit and miss. Very disappointed as tonight's was a big miss."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, very slow to make. Plan extra time out order ahead. We waited over an hour for a pizza (and the place wasn't busy)."}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet.  The restaurant was full but they kept the it full.  Nice for kids, but you see many business people here.  There was an o.k. salad bar, soups were good, so were the wings and pizza and breaksticks.  Some games for kids, too."}
{"text":"My go to pizza place pretty good nice and crunchy always comes warm never had a complaint"}
{"text":"I'm very confused about all the great reviews for the Pizza Oven. First, we Ordered three pizzas. Two do them were two for $24 plus a little extra for an additional topping. We ordered a 3rd three topping pizza as well. We were told on the phone that the price would be $41.90.   When the delivery guy showed up the bi was $49:50. There also wasn't a receipt provided in any fashion. The mobile website wasn't working so I couldn't double check the pricing. We did call back after the delivery to verify the the price. The women on the phone seemed to to have a difficult time coming up with our price.   The pizzas themselves were not quite OK. The one with the anchovies on it smelled beyond fishy... This one didn't get finished. The crust wasn't particularly crisp and the sauce was pretty bland. The Pizza Oven doesn't measure up to other delivery competition in the area. This review is based on a single experience, but I'm not particularly eager to try the the Pizza Oven again."}
{"text":"The pizza is good, not great, certainly don't go out of your way for it.  As a general rule of thumb with pizza places: if they offer a buffett, chances are their pizza isn't that spectacular.  When it's about quantity, quality usually suffers some."}
{"text":"Ewwwwww flat tasteless cold, I think the card board was better ? Went in to pick up, and seen there was a bar connected so went in for one,, big mistake lol very tasteless zaaaa"}
{"text":"2.5 stars is a completely inappropriate overall rating.  The pizza is great. There is a full bar with stiff drinks.  Everything is reasonably priced.  It may take a bit of time for your food to come out but it's always good, they employ neighborhood people, often younger kids who may not be polished - it's a genuine and authentic local spot, a neighborhood establishment.  The pizza is as good now as it was 20 years ago.    All of the bad reviews were posted by total *ucking amateurs."}
{"text":"Pizza was not as good as it used to be it was over cooked and hard like a pretzel . Takes for ever to get your order extremely slow no matter if you are the 3 couple in there or a packed house way over an hour for pizza terrible. Not worth the wait for sure"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Their lunch buffet is the best around.  $11 all you can eat lasagna, pizza, bread sticks, salad bar.  Love the variety of pizza with my favorite being the Chicken Bacon Ranch.  Would highly recommend for lunch some day."}
{"text":"The pizza here is mediocre. The sauce has very little flavor and I couldn't even taste the pepperoni. Plus when I recently talked with Greg the owner he was unfriendly on the phone and then hung up on me rudely. For my money Rossi's pizza down the road is far better. The pepperoni is flavorful and the sauce has that kick you can only get from Chicago style sauce. Plus the guys that work there are friendly. I would only recommend this place if you need a pizza on Monday night since Rossi's is closed that night."}
{"text":"Since Aftershock Retrogames moved its inventory over to Pizza Oven I've been meaning to get over there and give it the ol' college try and I finally managed to get the time to do so!  Their pizza is on the greasy side, but good. Their crust is crisp but not hard / overly brittle, nor is it greasy on its own-- it's very good. The grease factor brought on by their pepperoni definitely makes for great \"bar pizza\" and if that is what you are in the mood for -- they hit that mark very well. I'm fine with bar pizza but it doesn't make me as happy as less greasy versions, so ultimately I'd call it three stars (unless you really have that greasy pizza craving).  They did wow me with their breadsticks, however. They are lightly seasoned, crisp on just the slightest outer layer, and soft and hot on the inside. They embody the breadstickian ideal, 9/10, would eat again. The marinara was also not just Ragu poured out of a can, it tasted like they actually put some effort into it and I don't think enough restaurants do that so when I see it -- I appreciate it.  Their videogame room is smaller, so we're talking maybe 20 machines -- 4 pinball tables, total... ish (I didn't count). One was pricier than the others and sort of set apart / from another company, and they had an inactive one (for a 5th one) near the exit that I didn't pay much attention to. Most of the classic arcade favorites were there -- Burgertime, Mario Bros, Joust, Donkey Kong, etc... and the pinball tables that were in the room were Tales from the Crypt, Dr. Who, and Black Knight 2000 -- the best of the lot from Aftershock, IMO.  The other advantage I noticed is that there weren't roving gangs of 7-12 year old children. It's in a split bar / pizzeria setting and the pizza side closes down before the bar side does. That means if you want to have an arcade night out with the guys without it being invaded by the cast of Romper Room -- this is the place to do it.  So -- the TL;DR, the pizza crust is great, the meats can be a little on the greasy side, the breadsticks are amazing, there is a smallish arcade that packs a good 'arcade' punch since it covers the best of the old school lot.   Totally worth the trip to Monona!"}
{"text":"Dear Pizza Oven,  A little over a year ago we discovered your restaurant at it's old location. The first couple of times we came to you we liked the pizza, and regarded it highly. The cheese/crust/toppings ratio was perfect and I believe at that time there was only one kind of crust to choose from. That could be incorrect, but we were never asked to specify at that time when ordering. It was REAL (not some pre made garbage) and it was thin-ish, and it was very good.  Now a couple months ago, we ordered a pizza at your new location. This time we got a thin crust because the \"hand tossed\" was a dollar more. This experience was disappointing because the crust was TOO thin - dare I say, pre-made- and the overall pizza was light, weight-wise; We got a large for 2 people and we were still hungry after we had finished it. Not a pleasant feeling after having forked out 18 dollars.  So this time around we figured, OK, the Pizza Oven pizza we liked a year ago MUST have been their  \"hand-tossed\" option, which now costs a dollar more, but hey, let's give it another try. So we ordered a 16 inch gryo with a side of breadsticks. Big mistake.  The pizza was a disaster. While the toppings were generous, the CHEESE was overabundant. I know from my teenage days as a pizza maker that too much cheese can be a bad thing, which may seem counter intuitive, but it's so true. Here's the thing though: The crust of the pizza, the dollar-more-hand-tossed crust, was SOO DENSE and doughy. Not in a deep dish, fluffy and bready kind of way, either. It was exceedingly low in taste and texture. Dense layers of wet cardboard with too much cheese on top. OOF.   I was surprised, because it seems this place has been in business for a while now and had a good recipe going for a good pizza. But this was a failed attempt, to say the least.  Also disconcerting: the breadsticks were DEEP FRIED pieces of bread slathered with butter. OY. Yes they were tasty, deep fried anything is tasty! Oh my Lord the GREASE!!! What about my waistline! What about my foodie sensibilities! Gimme something to love here, Pizza Oven!   We walked out of the restaurant regretting our decisions, and vowing to never return.  I would have said something to the waitress(who was very good, I'll add), but I've gathered that she is the owner's daughter, so need I say more?"}
{"text":"The Pizza Oven is an institution in Monona (having been around 50 years). The lunch pizza buffet is not very large, but do you really need a lot when it comes to a buffet like that? Their dining room is spacious which is good for groups. This place is especially kid friendly. We were there for dinner. Not too busy but not deserted. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I got here on occasion for lunch.  Anyplace that has a Cheap Trick record on the wall for decoration can't be all bad.  It's a pretty standard pizza buffet. Their pizza is very good; I like their sausage pizza best, though their chicken/bacon pizza is pretty darn tasty, too.  If you go for the buffet during a busy lunch, you might wait a bit for decent pizza.  I've gone in at times and the buffet was picked clean and there was a good five or ten minute wait for a new one.    They also put out large pizzas.  This is fine when it's busy, but when there are less people in the store, then you end up going back while the pizza you just ate is still sitting there.  It doesn't lend itself well toward variety.    They do solid work here, though. I will always go back."}
{"text":"Homey feel, great pizza.  A great neighborhood pizza joint"}
