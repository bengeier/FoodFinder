{"text":"Great Place! Despite other comments the sauce is homemade.  Is it the original Ray's in NYC, NO but what place in AZ is. Despite that pizza and sandwiches are very good."}
{"text":"Come here at least once a week, great food, made with care, good people and comfortable environment...."}
{"text":"I too do not understand the guy who ordered chicken on his pizza???  Obviously not from the East Coast and doesn't know what a real New York pizza should taste like.  #1 Brothers has got it right!!  The pizza is great as are the subs.  Now, I do like a foofy California pizza kitchen type of pizza on occasion, but not when I want a good old slice of a pizza pie. The family that works there is very nice and helps to give that local mom and pop shop feel that makes you comfortable in your neighborhood.  Just a great all around neighborhood pizza place.  Manja!!"}
{"text":"Our family's favorite NY style pizza in Cave Creek.  We get a pizza and friend zucchini at least once a week and my kids are in there several times a week for Italian ice.  Everyone who works there are the friendliest people and always chat with us.  When they close for a few weeks each summer for vacation we have withdrawls!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, super nice family owned place. Will keep going back!"}
{"text":"The pizza is the best in Cave Creek. The wings are tasty. I always ask for crispy on the wings and pizza. The staff is friendly and helpful. They always greet my family with a smile."}
{"text":"I've personally been to this place severale times and I love it. The reason people that have written reviews before me said they don't like it is for a good reason. They may be used to the low quality food served at places like dominoes and pizza hut. Number one brothers on the other hand uses high quality ingreadients and family recipes for the sauce! People who don't like it just maybe aren't  used to higher quality food. If you have tried real east coast pizza you will love this place. The service there is incredible the staff are great, very friendly. You'll have to wait longer for food there because it's made fresh. That's not to say that it's slow though. The sauce is my favorite it's simmered for eight hours! How's that for quality? Try the shaved ice too. I recomend chocolate, it tastes like brownie. Anyway I highley recomend this place to any one who likes quality east coast pizza and subs. Chase out!"}
{"text":"I'm from the northeast and pizza is just not the same anywhere else. HOWEVER...my husband and I definitely love No 1 Brother's. No fancy, frilly pizza here, just the real thing. Hits the spot every time. The owners are cool but polite, just makin' awesome pizza, time and time again. Whether we dine-in or pick up a pie to take home, they put the same love into it.  Ppl who don't like this place are nerds, sorry."}
{"text":"The pizza was Delicious, and the staff was great.  The owner made a special heart pizza for my son on valentines day.  They cater to there customers!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizzas, salads too but definitely pricey. We've gone a few times with another couple or my parent or fiances parents and a pair of pizzas and either salad or wings is rapidly approaching $50. Nice break flavor-wise from the national chains, but personally it's not good enough to justify the price as our regular pizza joint."}
{"text":"Cass and crew run a tight shop. Like his uncle's place (@Pizza by Napoli), this is a no-nonsense pizza joint. Great crust. Slices have been overcooked, so if you're ordering a fresh pie, ask for it to be not too well done (unless you like it super crispy)."}
{"text":"Best wings and NY style pizza around! Love the atmosphere. They seem like a true pizza-loving family."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area so we wanted to try out the local pizza places. We tried Barro's first, then tried #1 Brothers. We really enjoyed it! It was good NY style floppy pizza, just the way we like it. We will definitely return.   I'm docking a star because their prices online do not match the prices they actually charge. It says on their website that an extra large pizza with 1 topping should be $15, and it was $18 or $19. They should really update their site because it's misleading."}
{"text":"Terrible pizza. We tried 3 different times ordering at different times. Food was so terrible each time that I have no idea how they stay in business. Total disgrace to all pizza laces and I normally LOVE pizza, but I wouldn't eat there for free."}
{"text":"I totally agree with Chase D.. I'm from the east coast as well and the pizza is awesome..If you like Barros then yu really haven't tasted good pizza so I'm not surprised you don't like good you don't like good pizza..  Poor guy/girl"}
{"text":"My number one go to pizza joint! Absolutely love their pizza! Nothing is too much, too little, or too greasy! I usually order to pick up and get their special with wings. The wings are very tender and taste very fresh. I would recommend this over papa johns or dominos any day! The staff is super friendly and all family. If you haven't already tried this restaurant of highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. The GF is the best I have had. Old NYC style. Not fancy but so good."}
{"text":"Visited 5/27/13  I have been to this place prior, but it was long before I was a member on Yelp.   This review is done in conjunction with another review for Vino 100 which is in the same center.  Attending a music event at Vino 100, which has a limited food menu.  But they allow you to bring food in.    Brought in a large pizza. Had the usual toppings.  Pizza is one of the better NY style pizza in town. It is too bad it is so far from my usual hang outs.   Cave Creek is lucky to have this place as there are so few options available in this area. If you are traveling, stop by and try a pizza."}
{"text":"#1?  More like one star...and then only if you consider serving yourself greasy cardboard.   Very disappointed. Poor service, poor food."}
{"text":"Love love love. I just moved back to cave creek. I ordered the deep dish/Sicilian pizza with pepperoni , pineapple and double garlic pizza. Amazing. Staff is very nice too. Get it! It's damn good."}
{"text":"Friendly folks and great food.  Enjoyed very much!"}
{"text":"Update: This place generously sells their amazing pizza dough! So you can get a dough ball and use your own sauce & cheese to make amazing pizza! The dough is light years ahead of the stuff I normally get from Trader Joe's, and definitely makes a better pizza. Number 1 Brothers Pizza has been redeemed in my book. ---------------------  I really wanted to like this place cause I love pizza and it's really close to where I live. But overall the pizza just wasn't that good. It tastes like the stuff they churned out of a high school kitchen for summer camp for kids. The tomato sauce tastes like the straight-out-of-a-can tomato paste, with absolutely no flavoring or herbs. The cheese tastes not very cheesy (I don't know how that's possible). I will hand it to them on the crust, which is amazing. We got the NY-style pizza and while the crust was thin, there still was a lot of air in it which gave it an amazing texture. The crust part was an amazing crispy but still doughy texture which I really liked.  Overall, Barro's is still my go to pizza place."}
{"text":"I have to completely agree with Justin about the quality of food from Number 1 Brothers; it was one of the worst pizza experiences I've had.. and I gave them two chances. The 'cheez' is nasty and it seems like all of the toppings are either canned or jarred. Avoid!"}
{"text":"We went here last night on a friend's recommendation-not so impressed. The pizza was OK, but  the wings were a disgusting, overcooked sloppy mess of fried wings covered in Frank's hot sauce-we had to ask the server for ranch twice (they were out of blue cheese) and there was NO SOAP in the restrooms. Gah! I hope they were washing their hands in the kitchen. The napkins on the table that came with said messy wings are not useful at ALL, tiny little unabsorbent waxy scraps. Decor is pretty worn out also. The pizza was OK, we had the \"special\" which apparently means \"too many green peppers and onions\". For the money, I will probably take the trip to Pizzafarro's or Ray's next time I crave pizza."}
{"text":"Re-visited Brother's Pizza Sunday night.  Got there very near closing.  They were as warm and friendly as before.  DH got a pepperoni pizza and I tried the Eggplant dinner.  Same fresh, crisp, unimaginative salad with house Italian dressing.  Eggplant was good----generous slices of eggplat properly fried, but a bit soggy after having been baked in sauce.  If I knew them better, I would tell them that they should reheat eggplant and sauce separately---eggplant on grill or salamander---then put together for serving.  That's how you keep the crispy fried goodness.  Maybe I can tell them in a year or so, lol!  The mozarella they use is soooo good!  But all in all, it was another really tasty meal---I actually ate a slice of DH's pizza!    And bless their hearts---I bet we walked in just as they were closing, because the minute we walked out, the lights went off----they didn't even clear our table!  Yet they never once made us feel like an inconvenience.  Sorry guys!  We'll try to come earlier next time!  :)"}
{"text":"It's our local pizza joint.  Pizza is good...nice people. Antipasta salad excellent....nice people.  Nothing earth shattering, just down to earth pizza joint....did I say nice people?"}
{"text":"Maybe I came the wrong day, but the pizza I had was really dry, no zest at all. The price was good but I expected more since my friend raves about this place and there were lots of good reviews   I will come back soon and give it a second chance.  Hope they will see this. Oh, the guys working there were cool."}
{"text":"Well, I have to respectfully disagree with the previous two reviews for #1 Brothers.  I live nearby and anytime I have ordered their pizza or food for that matter I haven't been disappointed.  The food has always been ready on time and they will even cook it a little longer  to get the more well done crust, which I like.  I will agree that some of the toppings may be canned, olives and mushrooms, but it has always tasted fine.  This is a good place for a few pizzas for watching a game or just spur of the moment.  The only draw back is that they don't deliver and are closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"Sadly, looks permanently closed for business. Had sign on door saying \"locksmith do not open without owners permission\". Soda thing had lights on but completely empty. Was there on Tuesdat at 6:50pm."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I gave it two chances and it was bad on the first try and absolutely disgusting on the second try. I don't know what this place is \"Number 1\" of, but it sure isn't pizza.   I could tell the ingredients were cheap, the cheese just looked gross and the crust was like a cracker. The veggies on top weren't even cooked. So, there were raw, cold vegetables on top of my pizza. It was not even edible. So we returned the pizza and haven't been back since. Even though it's right down the street from me, Barro's is only a little further and is a million times better. If you are looking for pizza in Cave Creek, do not look here unless you have incredibly low standards on what constitutes edible."}
{"text":"What a disappointment - the staff were extremely rude and condescending - the pizza was not great - I agree with the other comments - the ingredients came out of a can - and there was nothing special about the pizza.  There's so many other better pizza places in the area."}
{"text":"I predicted this place would close two years ago, how it remained open for as long as it did is a Mystery. This is some of the worst pizza I've ever had, even after trying it several times. The restaurant was dirty most of the time, and the service extremely poor, on our last and final trip they started mopping the floor while we were still there eating, late. Our group and others were made to feel uncomfortable, and we left, never to return. To call this New York pizza, is a joke, being from New York I can assure you this is not."}
{"text":"What happened to this place???  For years, it was our local go-to for pizza and wings.  Loved the owner and his family - great service, great food, too.  But, the owner and his family either sold this place, or turned it over to another brother.  lol  And, it's now disgusting.  I've been in twice since the change in ownership/management, and I'm done trying.  Each time, it was filthy.  They had dirty dish rags laying on top of the pizza on the counter, there were dirty dishes all over the counter and the tables, containers with used dish water on the counter next to the food...  Just nasty. Service?  Forget it.  One time I came in, and they couldn't figure out how to work the cash register, so, ignored me for 10 minutes while the entire crew took a whack at it, each taking turns yelling at each other, while reading the manual.  Shame."}
{"text":"Solid for pizza and wings.  CHEAP pitchers of beer(including Amber bock) Dependable for getting takeout orders right.  Eat in clean but pizza parlor-ish.  TV's always on for sports. Staff is friendly, beer is cold, pizza yummy."}
{"text":"This is NOT your high-end, fancy-pants, California Pizza Kitchen kind of place.  Think New Jersey - which is good, solid old-fashioned pizza put together by real Italians.  Basic pizza with basic toppings at a very reasonable price.  I'm not surprised Justin D. wasn't happy with the chicken they put on his pizza - this ain't that kind of joint!  He might just as well have asked for the Thai chicken pizza, or the pesto pizza - not here!  Basic decor with TVs playing and booths throughout.  I found it a good lunch stop when I went.  I was in and out quickly with no requirement to mentally wrestle with a big menu.  It's serve yourself, so no tipping a waitress.  Guy from the kitchen brings out your food but otherwise you get your own drink - fast food style.  It is what it is.  Basic but decent and surprising to find that business model in a strip plaza in la-de-da Cave Creek."}
{"text":"The pizza is okay. The salads are not that great. Too many onions on mine and the dressing is not anything to die for. I personally think the pizza is way too greasy for me and the slices are too huge. The cheese they use for the cheese pizza is not your normal tasting cheese, the pepperoni pizza is definitely better than the cheese pizza."}
{"text":"How you doin'?  Doin' good, doin' good.  THis is da place for slices, yeah, 2 slices & soda for south of $5.  Nice deal.  You can do a beer if you prefer.  Plenty of parking.  Old school style place for slices, wings, fried mushrooms & zuch.  Cheers."}
