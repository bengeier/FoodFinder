{"text":"Algoberto's is similar to Roberto's similar menu. One of my favorite things to get here is the Menudo which you can only order on Saturday and Sundays, sometimes they run out quick so if your craving for some Menudo you have to make sure you come early. The lengua tacos are also delicious here. They have a special for 5 small tacos and a small drink for under $6."}
{"text":"Chimichangas are great. Look for the specials, but the whole menu is good. I always enjoy the pickled veggie bar, but remember to get some water before you down those jalapeños. I've eaten there at least 20 times, one time the meet was over-cooked and dry (better then under cooked). otherwise a five-star."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time and it was legit....I had the chili verde burrito which was the business....can't wait to try a lot of other menu items....robertos ain't got nothing on them and I was a regular there....ALGOBERTOS IS MY NEW SPOT YO!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Algos! The staff is always so friendly, so nice. The food is beyond delicious. I would recommend the beef flautas with guacamole. Yumm!"}
{"text":"You know algobertos used to be great back in the day when you could could get some bang for your buck . The bean and cheese burrito used to be 2.50$ and would buy it every day . Now the bean and cheese is almost fucking 4$ . A can of beans cost at the highest 1$ and the amount of cheese in the burrito .50$ . But fuck me right they need a profit margin of fucking 3$ ... naw I'm good and everything else is up. Breakfast fucking burrito costs 8$ . If I'm paying 8$ dollars for a fucking breakfast burrito I better be getting chef ramsy cooking my food back there or a handjob from one of the employees male/female ! Boycott algobertos"}
{"text":"I eat here like everyday!  The staff is great. Friendly and helpful. Carne asada fries, tortas, rolled tacos and quesidillas are great!!!!!!  This is a clean taco shop!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! We've been going here for years now. The food is so delicious and the employees are always friendly and nice.  We especially love the beef chimichangas, fish tacos, enchiladas, and taquitos. But from experience you can't go wrong with anything you order. We usually call ahead and pick up our food.   Don't forget to ask about their specials...great deals with those."}
{"text":"The name is brilliant, but I laugh every time I say \"Some Berto's.\" But as a seasoned cook of 20 yrs, and a pallet that consumes hot sauces of 800,000 cu heat units, I can still say that there are still plenty of flavors in this Berto's locale. I get the Carne Asada Fries mostly, and I have tried Don Tortaco, Fausto's and of course Roberto's and there is something about Algo's that is a tad bit better. The salsa bar has more choices and is always clean whenever I visit. If you are in the area, I recommend. Be weary of people who don't have an affinity in the kitchen, and one's who don't understand that taste buds change every 7 yrs."}
{"text":"Food was good, but I got an intestinal issue. Thought it was a flu bug. Then tried it again. Got the same intestinal issue. It might be from the salsa bar. Anyway I'm not going back. Contamination somewhere with their food."}
{"text":"Found a new hidden treasure this evening!!  I have been searching for a local taco shop that has Carne Asada Burritos that are not only flavorful, but don't squirt oil all over the place when you take a bite out of it.  I have had a difficult time finding a taco shop that is as good as any in San Diego, CA.  I ordered 4 Carne Asada Burritos, 1 Breakfast Ham Burrito, & 3 beef Flautas. My order was prepared very quickly.  You have to give this place a try, the food is good, the place is spotless clean, the girl working the counter is friendly, and the food is fairly priced. Overall, I rate this Mexican Taco Shop my new favorite for the Northwest (Centennial Hills) area. I found this place tucked away behind the 7-11 at the corner of Farm @ Cimarron"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos  you must try ! We also come for taco Monday they have tacos for $1 !"}
{"text":"This is a regular stop for our family. Best rice and beans in town! It's not a fancy restaurant, it's a small taco shop, which we like. The prices are low and the food is plentiful. The folks that work here are pleasant and helpful. Our favorites are the carne asada nachos and chicken burrito. They have delicious horchata too."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and very accommodating for my family's food allergies. Always clean and the food is consistently tasty. We like the chicken quesadillas, tacos and chile relleno."}
{"text":"I eat here at least twice a month with my wife. Sometimes we eat in and sometimes we carry out. The food is amazing, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Everything we have ever had here is amazing.  Asada fries are out of this World.  Try the carnitas plate  off the chain."}
{"text":"Way better than Robertos, the carne asada nachos were so good! They actually make an amazing chicken burrito that's not dry like Robertos! Glad we decided to give this place a try last night!"}
{"text":"I lived in the neighborhood for more than a year before I realized this place was tucked in behind 7-11. The staff are super friendly and the Carne Asada is way betterr than Albertos. I eat here at least once a week and have never found anything to complain about."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times.  Once right on the cusp of the witching hour that is dinner.  The other time was the lull between lunch and dinner.  Witching hour busy....lull not so much.    Based on the two experiences, Algobertos is GTG (good to go).  The service has twice been friendly and smiley.    The menu is very similar to another establishment that ends with...\"tos.\"    The food is a solid A-OK.  This is based on a mean average of earlier orders (carne asada burrito w/ cheese, sour cream and guac plus a quesadilla) dating back to the 80's. When I saw my brother on the first bite, spit out a chunk of gristle on the most recent visit, I braced myself for a similar experience.  One runs the risk of that at a \"TOS\" style joint cruising down the carne asada highway.  Luckily, I was GTG.  When in need of chow, this is an absolutely A-OK option!"}
{"text":"What can I say the price is RIGHT the food is always FRESH and GREAT. Service is fast and courteous. I just wish they'd open at 7 a.m. instead of 8 a.m. or even 7:30 a.m. or even 7:30 a.m. By far the best fast food Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been very pleased every time I've eaten here.  I've had their street tacos, chicken tacos, burritos, flautas, carne asada, milanesa, and others, and enjoyed everything.  Great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Better, cleaner, faster, and more bang for your buck than Robertos! Delicious and filling with quality ingredients. Got the Coctel de Camarones among other things- amazingly yummy with at least 8 BIG juicy shrimp, I want to say they were prawns because they were so big. Not mushy or over cooked just juicy crisp and refreshing. Also wanted to compare their menudo, wasn't disappointed- for $6-7 you get a lot and it's not all broth. Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Mi gusto. King Burrito De desaynuo es mi numero uno! El taqueria es muy limpiar y rapido.  Boom! Can you believe I failed high school Spanish class?? Me neither!  This neighbor joint is close to the pad and way better than Robertos.. I am happy they are here.   There is a window that you can look through and watch the cook prepare your food although I like to just make funny faces and blow my cheeks up on the glass.. that just me doe.."}
{"text":"I love this place. I was sad when I saw the Roberto's close here but was pleasantly surprised to see Algoberto's opening.   I eat here at least twice a week, and I ate the Carne Asada Fries for dinner last night. I love the food here, the only thing negative is it can be a little pricey. Their drinks are a major up-charge, but there is a gas station across the way to get cheap drinks from."}
{"text":"We come here just to get their carne asada fries, because they are bomb. Once we got a chicken chimichanga and it was meh, but I didn't care because we also had those fries. They're always super quick and food is always fresh and hot, and their salsa isn't half bad either."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS burritos & rolled tacos. Ask for the tortilla on your burrito to be made extra crispy :) the California burrito with Adobada is my fave! & they have a bar with limes, sauces & peppers!"}
{"text":"The absolute worst fish taco I have ever eaten.  Lots of icy lettuce and one sad, skinny, overly fried, previously frozen fish \"fillet\".  More like a fish stick.  It was such a disappointing dinner because I have been craving fish tacos all week and decided to try this place out.  What a terrible mistake.  My partner ordered the shrimp and rice plate which was not to appetizing either.  It tasted just how it looked.  Meh.  Inside the restaurant is pretty blah.  Bright colored walls along with bright buzzing fluorescent lights don't really make a great eating environment.  Complete silence except the buzzing that the lights and the ice machine made.  Pretty sad.  I wanted to like this place since it is pretty close to where I am currently staying but there are just too many \"blahs\" and \"mehs\" for me."}
{"text":"So upset. I ordered chips and cheese (thinking it would be melted queso cheese like every other restaurant) but it was just shredded cheese on top of a bunch of chips. I even asked the girl if it was queso and she said yes. Oops, language barrier. I also ordered a bean and cheese burrito and it was SO nasty. The beans were like canned bean dip, I had to add sour cream and a ton of other condiments to make it edible. I asked if I could get a beef burrito without the red tomato sauce and was told that it's all pre-made, so no. WOULD NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Came here after I left the hospital for a check up on my little one.   Pretty yummy, they make the food quickly and it tastes fresh. I feel it's a bit pricey for what it is but I would definitely swing by here if I'm in the neighborhood.   If you're looking for a quick bite of Mexican, definitely try it out"}
{"text":"Good food and actually their food tates cleaner than Robertos. There the only place I know of that makes grilled Chicken Asado burritos. Wifey & kids prefer & love  their Carnitas fries over Robertos. The restaurant is clean and their restrooms are always fresh & clean. The staff are friendly. They have their Chicken  Tacos special every Monday  $0.99 cents each."}
{"text":"The man brought me carne fries with extra pico and sour cream this morning. The fries were a little bigger than most places so it stays crispy!!! The portion size was really good for the price. I could only finish half of it! My only complaint was that there was more pico and meat than fries. Everything was really good tasting though so I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"My family comes just for the Flauntas,, can't find them anywhere else close,, and they are delicious!"}
{"text":"This is the bomb for Mexican fast food!!! I could eat here 7 days a week. The bean and cheese burrito, beef tacos are the best I've eaten. When visiting Vegas , I make sure to drive here several times for my Mexican food fix. Inexpensive and fast, tasty food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great \"mom and pop\" style Mexican burrito joint. The chimichanga was great! It's definitely a \"don't judge a book by its cover\" place."}
{"text":"Super filling Mexican food but is like a knock off for robertos but more expensive than robertos. The girl at the front is super cool. She loves me and my grandma. The mini tacos are bomb. They recently raised their prices."}
{"text":"I will give it a 4 and that's pretty good. Same setup as robertos with the salsa bar and free stuff to dress your meal. I will be going again soon and can't wait. Cheap and good, not gourmet per se but the price is gourmet lol"}
{"text":"Love love love the food!!! Stop raising the prices you guys are good but go easy on those prices!!!"}
{"text":"Good for quick, inexpensive take out. The menu is the same as Roberto's but the quality is higher."}
{"text":"The 2 is for customer service, they are nice, but the food is gross!!, Chicken tacos super greasy and chicken over cooked, fish tacos too much topping to hide the super small and burnt fish, just nasty back to Roberto's for me"}
{"text":"If you are from Southern California and looking for good street tacos.. keep looking. Al pastor taco was not very good, had meat that wasn't editable. Also they have lemons not limes at the salsa bar. Carne asada taco was pretty good. Rolled taquitos were average. Got them with cheese and guacamole. All in all an average place. I will say it was clean in the restaurant"}
{"text":"This spot is kinda hidden in the back of a shopping center with a 7-11 and the Lucky's Lounge. It's pretty much exactly like Roberto's with a different name. I think they might even use some of the same pictures on their menu. Ok, I'm kidding...but they are close!   The food here is ok and they have a pretty good selection. I had a California burrito and my wife had a chicken burrito. They have really good tortillas and both meats were decent, not overcooked, tender, and had good flavor. I liked their salsa bar too, their green sauce is really tasty. They are fairly cheap but a little pricy for add-ons...my wife wanted sour cream and they up charged her $0.95. We also had chips but the store bought, runny guacamole kinda ruined them for me.  With Leticia's just down the street and a Roberto's not far either, I wouldn't pick Algobertos as my first stop. But they have good prices, the place is spotless and the food was decent enough to come back, especially on days they have specials!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to Mexican restaurant. The food is always delicious and plentiful and the prices are very good. I used to drive pretty far away to go to a place that I thought had \"good\" tacos and didn't realize this hidden gem was very close to my house and much more delicious. The staff is always pleasant! Algobertos- you rock!"}
{"text":"This is much like Robertos with a slight difference in taste.. after a great workout at the gym I had a craving for the tacos and enchiladas.. It's amazing how this stuff taste so much better after a few beers/cocktails. I know I wasted my workout for this stuff.. and this time I agree.. after I ate it, I felt the gut bomb sitting in my stomach. So I will have to push the craving demons away and only eat this stuff after a night out. Roberto's seems slightly better.. but it could be the same exact recipies.. who knows?"}
{"text":"WAY BETTER THAN ANY ROBERTO'S! I've lived in Vegas most of my life and I'm telling the meat and beans are way better here than Roberto's. Anything you get here is delicious."}
{"text":"I actually found this place via a search on Yelp. Located at Cimarron and Farm, it's much the same as any other taco shop. There is nothing fancy here. A few tables, a menu board and a self service fountain soda machine featuring Pepsi products. But do you come for the decor or good Mexican food? Having had my fair share of Mexican over the years, I can honestly say you won't be disappointed. I have been a few times now and it has always been bueno. My most recent visit was my first experience with their carne asada burrito. I must say it was better than the last CAB I had at Roberto's. My daughter echoed those same thoughts about the bean and cheese burrito. I will definitely be frequenting when the craving for Mexican hits."}
{"text":"I have to give it 4 stars because I am a die hard Roberotos fan!  Until the one down the street opens up this is our Sunday night spot after church.    The carne asada is always marinated very well and I have never gotten any fatty meat."}
{"text":"Want good Mexican?  Go to Algobertos and order the Chicken Burrito with rice, beans, cheese, pico, sour cream and guacamole and you will think you died and went to Heaven, that's right, it's that good!! Sadly, I've lived here 15 years and it took that long to find a Burrito shop as good as the one's in the Bay Area (sorry, Roberto's I'm not a fan:(.  The only problemo is that I live waaaay South! My mom's Chile Verde burrito was delicioso too."}
{"text":"I go here very often. The people are very friendly and the food is delicious. Pretty fast waiting time as well.  I recommend then 3 rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese and the California burrito add sour cream."}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING!  There is actual flavor in everything you eat.  My favorite is the chicken nachos!  Flavor stacked on flavor stacked on flavor.  And no, you cannot finish it in one sitting.  But guess what, when you reheat tomorrow (in the oven of course) they are still just as yummy as when you received them!  This place has Mexican food CORRECT!  It is hidden behind Lucky's Bar so just get in the parking lot and you will find it.  My friend always orders the Carne Asada (ANYTHING!) and we are quiet for the first 8 minutes of receiving that food.  They put these 'gas station' Mexican restaurants to full on shame!  Delicious!"}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews, I decided to check this place out instead of hitting up my regular robertos.  I tried a bean and cheese burrito and three rolled with guac & cheese. One word, amazing! Got both for under $7 & it honestly was a bit better than robertos! Def will be back next time I'm in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This place is a lot like Roberto's. Not a destination. I usually get a chile relleno burrito, and I like it a lot. They also have really good pickled carrots in their salsa bar. The beverage selection is okay - Pepsi fountain drinks.  I'm taking off one star for the rude service I got the last time I went in, about a week ago. I wanted to know the price of nachos without meat and the rude girl at the register gave me the price, which was higher than the menu price for nachos with meat. I asked about this and she insisted that it wasn't. It turns out they're the same price, which is okay, I guess, but there's no need to be rude."}
{"text":"This place is great for that late night munchie. My wife and I ate here on a Monday night and we thought it was going to be like Robertos. The menu is identical but the quality is above and beyond Robertos. We ordered Chicken Tacos and a Cane Asada Burrito. The Chicken Tacos were stuffed to perfection. There was an even blend of cheese and lettuce. Not to forget the chicken was seasoned great. The Cane asada Burrito was stuffed with all the goodies and they didnt even charge me for all the extras. The price was exceptional. We spent $8.00 and got (1) Carne Asada Burrito with extras (4) Chicken Tacos and (1) Large Fountain Coke. So I have to say $8.00 well spent!!!"}
{"text":"Algobertos is still my choice for quick Mexican food; my favorite!  Best food, Best Service, Most Friendly, and Most Honest!  Left my wallet there once on the counter near the condiments; drove all the way home; freaked when i found out about my missing wallet with my life in it.  When i went back to find my wallet, it was gone; my heart sank to my stomach. I looked up to the cashier at the counter and he was smiling and pulled up my wallet he was saving for me; all in tact and accounted for.  I was in such a panic thinking the worst!  Thanks again to the staff at Algobertos and the one gentlemen staff member who saved my life! :)"}
{"text":"Mediocre and expensive as taqeria go.  Normally I would have more to write but there's just nothing more to say.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"We love Algobertos! They have the best mini carne tacos ever! Their condiments bar is the best! Love the carrots, and radishes! Their green and red salsa is the super good! Some of the best salsa that we have tasted. The people are wonderful, and have always graciously engaged us in a conversation. We hope this little gem, stays in our \"hood\" forever! Thank you for great food, and good conversation."}
{"text":"The rolled tacos here are the best, and the chimichangas are massive. Cant really go wrong with what you order, really."}
{"text":"We LOVE Algoberto's! We could eat there daily! Our fav is the carne asada fries & carne asada chimichanga. YUMMY!!"}
{"text":"Food sucks. It tastes like something from a middle school cafeteria. I got the chicken nachos and it tasted like burnt chicken without any seasoning, refried beans from a can, artifical cheese from the dollar store, runny \"guacamole\", and just absolutely no taste. All I got was a stomach ache from it. There is no skill in their cooking. It's just a big glob. Tastes like something a drunk college kid put together in the microwave of his dorm room.   Go to Jefe's Tacos nearby. 1,000,000x better.  Update: I ended up getting food poisoning. Avoid completely!!!"}
{"text":"Each time I go in I order the 5 street taco Special with a fountain drink.  El Pastor is life and it's delicious each and every time.  Love this spot.  This is a must stop when you're craving Mexican food.  Stop what you're doing and go now."}
{"text":"Really like this place. I always get the carnitas but have recently become a fan of the chicken quesadilla for my kids. I can feed my family of four with just those two items (unless we really want to pig out). Pretty quick service. We've both eaten there and taken it to go. Nothing fancy if you are sitting down there but it does the trick if you are really hungry. We've also heated up the food as leftovers and it is still delicious."}
{"text":"Haven't tried one bad thing here! I've walked in and seen them making their guacamole fresh in the morning. Their beans are super creamy, tortillas are perfect and condiment bar is always well stocked."}
{"text":"It's been a hot minute since I last wrote a review, but here we go!!!!! First of all, this little taco shop is a bit hard to find, but thanks to Google Maps, I have found this little gem in North Las Vegas ( in the Centennial Hills area). This little strip mall does not have too many shops open, and the parking is very small, and limited. If you pass the 7-eleven, you have gone too far.  Don't be fooled by the Interior, because the setup does look like most Roberto's taco shops. But, I think the owners of Algoberto's took over the eatery, and left the interior as it is.   The Menu is Very Similar to Roberto's, but the Quality of the food is much better. The eatery itself is kept clean, they do clean the floors, and tables throughout the day. And the Condiments are kept cool, and stocked up as well.   Very friendly staff workers, the prices are reasonable, the food is hot & tasty. Quick in, and out service."}
{"text":"I would give them more stars but after giving chance after chance I'm just over it.     This place is great if you don't come here all the time.  But if you try to come in nightly or more than once in a week count on none consistent food.   Order after order I ask for carne asada fries extra crispy fries and everytime they undercook my fries purposefully.. Like what the heck?!   Even after tipping all the time I would think something would change but apparently not.    That's what really blows my mind is that I tip ALWAYS. Never less than 3 dollers...   Never feel the love at this place.  Or like they care at all.  Especially the evening and night workers they're the worst.     So I'm giving up on this place and going back to Jefes tacos just down the road.    Portions or WAY BIGGER!! And they actually listen to you when you ask for simple things like extra crispy fries LMFAO..."}
{"text":"Very nice workers. THE BEST CHICKEN TACOS IN TOWN!! and they also sell the little carne asada street tacos I'm always dying to have and no one has them!! Always great service!"}
{"text":"Great local Mexican joint . Carnitas are my favorite .Prices very reasonable .Quick stop on way home from work"}
{"text":"Fast, cheap and good. Better than Robertos and close to my place. Tried their tacos, rolled tacos and burrito and have no complains for what I paid for. Plus they close at 11pm, even better!"}
{"text":"It's ok. I love their competitors Roberto's so when someone at work told me this place was baically the same thing I thought I would give it a try since it was closer. Never again.  The food was decent, the place was clean and staff friendly but it's just a cheap knock off. Must say the pricing  was really good.  One could get lunch for not too much cash out of pocket which is always a good thing.  I'll stick with my usual  place."}
{"text":"Yum! When I'm not counting calories I love to splurge at this place & get the carne asada nachos, I take them home & heap them w/romaine lettuce & end up eating them for 2 meals bcz they are so huge. The tacos are delicious & authentic, the chille rellenos is perfecto! I have never had a bad meal there & they are always friendly & fast. Love the salsa bar!"}
{"text":"Another one of those former Roberto's with a new name. Same food and its pretty bland. Roberto's has slid far far from its once glorious days of deliciousness."}
{"text":"The only reason this isn't a 5-star is we have only had their burritos.  Highly recommend them.  We've been several times and have nothing but positive things to say.  The decor is simple, leaving the food to speak for itself.  Staff is plesant and welcoming; look forward to our next visit! R&J"}
{"text":"So far I've eaten the carne asada nachos and menudo. Both were excellent tasting. I'm Hispanic, so I'm a little biased on Mexican food. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for fast Mexican food if your in the centennial area."}
{"text":"A great cali-mex type of joint. Exactly like Roberto's but better service. Always a great tasting meal with a smile. Reminds me of a local hole in the wall place after catching some tasty waves."}
{"text":"Oh man, there is no place in NW Las Vegas that I'd rather go to for lunch under $10! The quality of the food and salsa bar is stellar! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for breakfast after taking one of our rabbits to the vet. My girlfriend had machaca burrito and I had a chorizo burrito. I didn't taste hers, but she's picky when it comes to mexican food, and she loved it. My chorizo burrito was also great! It wasn't greasy like some places. Best of all was their horchata. Sounds crazy but true. Sooooo many places make it too sweet, too milky, too watery, too cinnamony, but it was perfect here. I'd love to try more here, but it's too far from home."}
{"text":"It's a little hidden you have to be looking for it to find it. Service was quick and seating was spacious. The food was also surprisingly good for how quickly it came out. Well worth it if your looking for Mexican food."}
{"text":"This location is always clean and the food is always fresh!  Plus, they keep the condiment bar super clean & cold! Always friendly!"}
{"text":"This is a good cheap Mexican restaurant, not the greatest, but never disappointing. Not sure why yelp rates this at two dollar signs for cost, definitely one dollar sign pricing. I normally stick with the California burrito, but have never ordered anything that I didn't like."}
{"text":"This place was alright,service was good, salsa bar was clean,dining area was clean,but the food was so....plain. The salsa was also very plain. Cost of our meal was average mexican food prices."}
{"text":"First time and I was so impressed. California burrito was amazing and the rice was the best I ever had.  I also loved how clean the place was. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"YUM! We actually like Algobertos better than the Robertos in the area. Algobertos is a favorite of ours! Carne Asada nachos, Bean and Cheese Burritos, Rolled Tacos and Super Burritos are among our favorites when we go.  The staff is always friendly and the owners are usually there too always smiling! We can't wait to check out the one they opened in Searchlight!"}
{"text":"One of the great things about vegas is the plethora of little mexican joints like this one , but some of them can be nasty. Aligobertos is a nice example of how all taco shops should be kept. This location is very clean and the staff is always polite and friendly.   The food is tipical fast food taco shop style, it's good but not great. I normally get the nachos and sometimes the breakfast burrito and they are both delicious.  All in all I recommend this spot."}
{"text":"We have loved this place for awhile now. But this time we went the customer service was horrible. We have a taco plate that was supposed to come with guacamole on it, it has a time tiny bit so my husband went and asked for more because it didn't have a lot. The girl kept saying it came with it, and my husband was saying it didn't come with hardly any, the cook then said he wanted to see my husbands plate, because they didn't believe him. So rude! If a customer wants more they should be able to get some without having to show the cook their plate. Very disappointed this time around."}
{"text":"Very tasty San Diego style Mexican food. We have had combo plate with enchiladas and tacos, chimichangas, & carne asada fries. All were  excellent. And they have a salsa bar where you can also get free pickled carrots and jalapeños.  The service is polite and friendly. At dinner time it can get pretty crowded in the dining room where there are a few tables and benches. We have not stayed there to eat but rather got takeout but I don't think it would be a problem eating  there. I am new to the neighborhood but plan on making this one of my go to restaurants!"}
{"text":"Kept seeing from different reviews on yelp that this place is better than Roberto's so we came here. Had an order of carne asada fries and a carne asada torta-- the fries were a lot smaller than Roberto's, with seemingly  less toppings too. The torta was okay, nothing special, so  unless you're around the shop already, there is really no reason you need to specifically come to this spot for a quick Mexican lunch."}
{"text":"We just left disappointed that their menudo is made without hominy. Ugh! Who doesn't put hominy in their menudo."}
{"text":"First time eating here. The prices are around the same, a few cents more or less then robertos. I ordered the carne asada fries $8.15. They were delicious. Fries, carne asada, sour cream and cheese (I opted for no guac). No beans came on them. The taste was there, they were really good. Unfortunately the portion size was small and   Wasnt smothered in toppings. I was able to eat it all in one sitting...usually I can make 2 meals from the one at robertos. I will not be ordering this from here again.   We also go the carne asada chimichanga$7.49. It was also smaller in size, but not complaints...the boss said it was GOOD and he would def. get it again. Even with it's smaller size he was full after he ate, good thing. :) Lastly, we got a bean and cheese burrito $2.80 and a wet bean and cheese burrito special w/ drink $3.90.   It was kind of busy when we went since it was Friday evening  so some of the tables were filthy. No biggie. The salsa bar was stocked and clean which is a plus.   I Can't say if I would return. For the price I paid for us to eat and for lil ol me to still be hungry...I might just have to pass."}
{"text":"Very good food and great service. One of our regular spots. The 99 cent chicken taco day is an awesome value. Also their kitchen is very clean :)"}
{"text":"I found it!! The Roberto's from 20 years ago. It was like stepping back in time. And I've been living near it for the past two years. Same creamy bean and cheese burrito from 20 years ago. I even had to dab the grease off with my napkin. 3 rolled tacos were crisp and actually tasted like fried chicken. I'm either going to get a lot fatter fast, or have to do this in strides. Diverticulitis is like a swarming shark. Got to watch that guy. But if you want the old school bean and cheese, and 3 rolled with guac and cheese, this is it. Btw, it's not Roberto's, it's Algoberto's."}
{"text":"Never knew this place existed and let me tell you it is a diamond in the ruff. Tastes better than robertos and much closer too. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The prices here are insane, what a nice change after spending so much downtown on meals. I can't believe the quality and quantity of food you get for what you pay. Burritos were like bricks and they must have made us a whole bag of chips for $1.50. Impressed!!!"}
{"text":"Clean,fast and inexpensive it's rare you get all three at one place but Algobertos gets things done!! The food was as good or better than any taco shop I've ever eaten at. Hands down my favorite place in the city."}
{"text":"Dropped by here on the way back from Mt. Charleston. I got a carne asada platter while my friend got the beef one. To be honest, I was surprised as to how delicious my food was. Even though their salsa bar was almost non-existent, it didn't matter. I would come back here whenever I'm nearby.   The place is really dirty and un-inviting. It's kind of like going to a McDonald that's in a bad part of town. Needless to say, don't come here for anything but delicious Mexican food."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place because it is nearby and it has a lot of good reviews. It's just fine if you're looking for Mexican take out food. If you've lived in Vegas for a while you know that Roberto's is the standard for decent, cheap Mexican food around here. Algobertos is pretty much the same thing. The menu looked to be nearly identical. I ordered a chili Verde burrito and it did not disappoint. There isn't a whole lot more to say. If anything it was a little cleaner than the average Roberto's and the self serve area with the red and green sauces had something I haven't seen anywhere else, freshly chopped jalapenos mixed with onions. So that was pretty cool. But honestly, the food is the standard fare for this area. If it's close by it's worth it but not if Roberto's is closer."}
{"text":"This is the REAL deal! Authentic mexican food. PLUS it's super clean.  I can't wait till we come back to Vegas. This is now a must stop when in town"}
{"text":"Ohh algobertos! You make me happy when I'm craving fried tacos and taquitos!  We always take our food to go, but that's because I can smell fabuloso or some other cleaning product in the air...which isn't a bad thing because you know they are cleaning the establishment."}
{"text":"Algobertos is the best Mexican restaurant I have found since moving to Vegas a year ago. I always get the #7 carne asada plate and the food is amazingly and consistently delicious! Within two weeks of discovering this little hidden gem of a place, I had eaten there 8 times."}
{"text":"4 stars for my Carne asada taco salad.   I let the husband go in to take my order because I wanted to see if I'd enjoy my food blindly. You know, food taste better when service is great or food tastes like poo because of poor service. My thought process was...it is windy and I'm hungry. I'd like to enjoy this taco salad without anyone ruining my vibe.  It's a shop located amongst a strip of businesses. You could easily miss it because it isn't quite street view. So when you see 7-11 at the corner--that's your cue to turn in. Lots of parking because it's one of those strips within a neighborhood. It took us all but 2 mins to get here since the husband works around the corner.  It took about 15 minutes and a little longer until my husband comes walking out with two bags of each of our taco salad. They place it onto their Styrofoam plates which obviously can't be closed.   We ate those suckers in the parking lot because I couldn't risk our food to get the sweating. It felt a little longer than necessary considering it was \"just\" a taco salad.  Opting for the Carne asada and omitting the beans and rice. What....don't judge. I can handle only so much moosh. Anyway, upon opening I quickly discovered why our food took a little longer for jusssst a taco salad.  I completely appreciate a fresh taco shell. Nothing like waiting long for a stale one. But not todaaay-ay. It was salad delight. All the fixings inside is typical of a taco salad, however, everything in it seemed soooo fresh!!! The lettuce, pico, guac, etc...fresh. furrrr-resh. Lettuce was nice and crispy, meat wasn't salty nor chewy, pico didn't look like twas sitting in a container overnight. I will add that the meat seemed kind of skim. They put their meat at the way bottom of the salad.   Honestly, though...being skim on the meat in a taco salad is alright with me. The meat wasn't even a feature of the taco.   The Carne asada taco salad is 6.95. We also ordered a horchata. What else would you wash all that down with during a midday fiesta. That large cup came.out to 2 dollar something.  The husband said the horchata were pre-poured into the cups which bare the Pepsi logo, that sits in a fridge waiting for someone to take them home. Their horchata wasn't overly sweet, and wasn't anything special to add. Just your typical horchata.  Blind test worked. I enjoyed my food without any biasness. Not that I'm biased. I woud love to return to try out their tacos or something of interest, and get the full-service myself. I'll update.   So 4 stars STRICTLY over the taco salad."}
{"text":"This location was previously a Robertos.  It is a similar in style to Robertos - quick serve mexican restaurant.  I go here not expecting culinary greatness - more for a quick flavorful lunch.  It's cheap and they almost always have a lunch special.  The Chile Relleno burrito is my favorite.  Ask for 2 rellenos and less of the other stuff.    Some times they have chicken tacos for .99... Bueno!  Basically - nothing fancy, but it's fast, tasty and cheap."}
{"text":"Solid place for quality and quick service. I picked up a carnitas torta and carne asada burrito, and was a happy man."}
{"text":"Just recently found this place and I'm sad I didn't know about it sooner. Great food, decent prices and friendly staff. I'm now a regular."}
{"text":"The worst Mexican food I've ever had.  Coming from Arizona I expected it to be similar. My cheese wasn't melted in my enchilada, the enchilada sauce tasted odd. I didn't like the refried beans either.    It was pretty busy, with regulars that came in so I thought it would be good. I was very disappointed.   Also their fountain drink machine was Down So we had the horchata, which didn't take authentic.   The customer service was great (2stars) and the rice was good!   Huge disappointment. Sorry ;("}
{"text":"Cleanliness: 5 Stars The front of the restaurant smells and appears very clean and sanitary. This small shop definitely takes pride in ownership  Hospitality: 5 stars The staff was smiling and greeted me with a welcome. I used their call ahead order service and was impressed with the friendliness and promptness received.    Food: 5 Stars The portions are large and made fresh to order. All our meals were hot and came accurate.  Overall: This place is great for a \"quick\" meal and more affordable than a traditional sit down restaurant. I would recommend to others looking for non-traditional Mexican food on the go this is a good option."}
{"text":"Yum!  Best carne asada I have had in a long time.  The restaurant is very clean and the service was friendly.  This place has been compared to Roberto's on occasions.  However.... The menu and prices may be the same but the food his so much better.  I would drive out of my way to visit this restaurant even if there was a Roberto's closer."}
