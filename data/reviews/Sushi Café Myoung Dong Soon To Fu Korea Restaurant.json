{"text":"Service is AMAZING! The chef is very sweet and greets you like a friend. He tries to know exactly what you want. The staff are also very friendly!  We accidentally discovered this hidden gem one day after a long game of UNO at snakes and lattes which is just a few steps west.  The food is very cheap and the portions are large. I wish I could tell everyone who amazing this place is! Its our new fav spot in the Annex!"}
{"text":"Still as good as ever.  However now instead of a fried fish, the complimentary appetizer is some kind of Korean latke. I think it is made with potato, carrot, green onion, and eggs or flour? It's served with a spicy salty chili sauce. It varies in deliciousness; sometimes amazing, sometimes blah.  But the tofu soup is still unbeatable and still $7.08!"}
{"text":"Went with four people following the usual central Bloor dinner rush.   First impression is that it's a little cramped looking yet cozy on the inside. I'm seeing some complaints about the decor, but I've seen cheesier for this kind of joint and it doesn't bother me.   We were greeted/seated right away with what seemed to be the only waitress on the floor, and she moved fast! Also friendly.  At first we were a little timid checking the prices because it seemed expensive compared to Yelp's one-money rating - however it works out because they have a BUY TWO dishes GET ONE FREE deal which is smashing.  Our table got a bibimbap, mexican rolls, crunch roll, salmon, avocado and california rolls. For apps we ordered tempura and pan fried dumplings.   ~First they gave us a free potato pancake app thing. It wasnt super but we had a fun time fighting pieces out of it. We also got free miso soups but they were waaayy too salty and my sister and I couldn't finish ours.  ~Dumplings were crispy and good but their sauce was weirdly vinegary, you wouldn't understand what I meant til you had it.   ~The bibimbap was extra delicious and came with the usual kimchi apps, and the chef came out to tell our friend to mix in the egg in from the top, so it would cook in the hot stone bowl. Kimchi was good, beansprouts good, but it came with a seaweed salad that my boyfriend said was horribly dry and old tasting.  ~The mexican roll was super good and came with just the right amount of spice. ~The crunch roll (as well as the mexican) looked really pretty and had a taste that was just as pleasing.  ~The set of plainer rolls was okay.  Our bill for 4 came to $50. So I would say it sounds average enough.  Overall we had a great time with no real issues. I'd recommend any of the special rolls, or the bibimbap, and stay away from buying the $5 seaweed salad (ours was free with the dish). We will go back :)"}
{"text":"This place is one of Koreatown's hidden gems. I'm almost sad to let you all in on it.  The food is amazing. Before you even order anything you'll be given an amazing array of starters, sometimes including a delicious Korean scallion pancake. Stews are flavourful and large, served with purple rice in a stone pot. And while the sushi is a little more elaborate than most places, it's always delicious. The baked salmon is especially good.  It's also amazingly inexpensive for how good it is. I would probably pay up to twice as much for the food. A single bowl of stew, in a giant stone bowl, with another bowl of purple rice, plus all the starters and sides, comes to about $7, which is one of the best deals I can think of, especially in the area. The buy-2-get-1-free deal on the sushi is also very tempting. Usually when I come here, I bring a friend, and we each get a stew and a roll and a half of sushi. We pay something like $15 each and walk away bloated and happy.  Also notable is is the amazing friendliness of the staff and chef. Except for the servers, nobody seems to speak too much English, but this doesn't prevent them from making you feel welcome. When you walk in, you'll be warmly greeted by everyone, as well as when you leave. I have no idea if I'm receiving special treatment, since they seem to do this to everyone, but I would be fully prepared to believe that everyone else who walks in is also a regular. They certainly make you feel that way. I've seen people drop in and leave bottles of wine for the chef, or just bringing in their kids for a visit. It's delightful. Don't all go at once."}
{"text":"the best korean food in koreatown. such great prices for delicious food. they serve the best banchan (side dishes). i haven't tried the sushi but the soft tofu and miso stews are so satiating as well as the stone bowls. the food alone is what makes this place stand out because you really have to disregard the decor here. i feel so nourished after eating here."}
{"text":"This is really a hidden gem in the Korean-town in Toronto.   We found it by chance and had a big take-out order of several dishes (all the \"non-special\" combo / bentos) from their menu posted on the wall in picture format.     Wow... it was good.  Tasty and good portion - as we were given several bags of \"boxes\" for 4 order of dishes.   May be we were hungry but the food hit the spot for all of us.     I should have deduct a star for their appearance and decoration of the restaurant (not spectacular at all) - but could not bring my hand to my mouse to do that - as I am weak from hunger just thinking about their food!     Give it try if you are around the area."}
